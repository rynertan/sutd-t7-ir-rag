# Polyurea polyurethan polymer polyol and its use in producing polyurethanes.

## Abstract
Polyurethane polymer polyols can be prepared by reacting a hydroxyl containing amine e.g. ethanol amine , a polyetherpolyol having a molecular weight of 2000 to 8000, and a less than stoichiometric amount of an organic polyisocyanate. The molar ratio of hydroxyl containing amine to polyether polyol is from 0.5 1 to 3.5 1. The molar ratio of active hydrogen in hydroxyl containing amine and polyol to isocyanate is from 1.4 1 to 3.5 1. In a preferred embodiment, the stability of the polyurethane polymer polyols is enhanced by adding a secondary amine. Polyurethane foams obtained by reacting the polyurethane polymer polyols with more polyisocyanate have generally better properties e.g. tensile and tear strength, elongation and compression than foams produced directly from hydroxyl containing amine, polyether polyol and a stoichiometric amount of polyisocyanate
