# Cash box security arrangements.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the security arrangements provided for the cash box for use in call coin box equipment and has particularly been designed for use in the new generation micro processor controlled call coin box equip ment. The cash box is provided with a lockable lid having a coin entry slot 4 and a coin entry shutter mechanism. The coin entry shutter mechanism co operates with a pair of mounting pins 6A, 6B in the coin box housing in such manner that removing the cash box from the mounting pins causes the shutter 3,4 to be automatically closed and locked over the coin entry slot 4 . The authorised opening of the cash box primes the shutter mechanism ready for replace ment on the mounting pins 6A, 6B without opening the coin entry slot 4 . Finally replacement of the cash box on the mounting pins causes the operating of the shutter mechan ism to uncover the coin entry slot.

## Description
TITLE CASH BOX SECURITY ARRANGENENTS The present invention relates to secure cash box mechanisms and is more particularly although not exclusively concerned with cash boxes which are to be located in coin operated equipment installed in public places. Typical of such equipment is the telephone system payphones where it is of importance to ensure that the coins collected by the payphone are securely held in the cash box in the payphone equipment. Further it is desirable that the security of the cash box should be maintained when it is removed from the payphone equipment by unauthorised personnel. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a secure removable cash box for use in coin operated equipment, which includes arrangements for preventing unauthorised. access to the inside of the box when it is removed from the coin operated equipment. According to the invention there is provided a cash box for use in coin operatea equipment, the cash box being removably located and including a lockable lid having a coin entry slot and a coin entry shutter mechanism in which the coin entry shutter mechanism co operates with cash box mounting arrangements in the coin operated equipment housing in such manner that removing the cash box from the mounting arrangements causes the shutter to be automatically closed and locked over the coin entry slot and the authorised opening of the cash box primes the shutter mechanism ready for replacement on the mounting arrangement without opening the coin entry slot and replacing the cash box in the coin operated equipment operates the shutter mechanism to uncover the coin entry slot. The invention will be more readily understood from the following description of the operation of a cash box mechanism according to one embodiment of the invention which should be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. Of the drawings Fig. 1 shows the cash box according tp one embodiment of the invention, Fig. 2 shows the cash box locking mechanism in the primed state, Fig. 3 shows the cash box locking mechanism in position in the payphone , Fig. 4 shows the locking mechanism after removal from the payphone while, Aig 5 shows the locking mechanism in the unlocked and re primed condition. The payphone cash box consists of a lid assembly 1 a container assembly 2 and a locking assembly 3. The lid assembly 1 carries the locking assembly 3 and a coin slot 4 together with a barrel lock assembly 5. The locking assembly includes two priming rod accom odating cylinders 31 and 32 having entry slots in one side wall of the lid assembly. The cylinders 31 and 32 are adapted to co operate with the rods 6A and 63 carried by the payphone back plate 6. The rods 6A and 6B include corresponding spigots 6As and 6Bs are arranged to co operate with the locking assembly mechanism to rotate a shutter barrel 33. To understand the operation of the locking assembly 3 consideration will be given to Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5 which show the locking assembly only in i the primed state ii operative state iii locked state and iv unlocked and re primed state respectively. Corresponding component parts on each of Figs. 2 to 5 carry the same reference numbers and some of the components, particularly relating to the barrel lock assembly have been removed from Figs.3 and 4 for sake of clarity. In the primed position Fig. 2 the shutter barrel is rotated so that the coin slot 34 is in a horizontal position and therefore entry through slot 4 in the lid of the cash box Fig. 1 into the container assembly 2 is prevented. The latch 35 is held against spring pressure provided by spring 36 by the pawl 37. The latch arm 35A engages the lock cam 51 which traps the catch 52. he catch 52 is secured to the cash box container assembly 2 thereby locking the lidassemb ly 1 ta the container assembly 2. When the cash box assembly is presented to the housing arrangements in the payphone the priming rods GA and 6B are located and accommodated within the cylinders 31 and 32.The rod 63 carries an inwardly projecting spigot 6Bs which is adapted to co operate with the shutter barrel actuator 38 to rotate the shutter barrel 33 through 90 in an anti clockwise manner when viewed from the cycliner 32 end of the mechanism as the cash box is pushed home onto the housing 6. The coin slot 34 therefore aligns with the coin slot 4 in the lid assembly. During the above operation the latch 35 is held away from the shutter barrel 33 by the pawl 37.As the cash box is pushed further home on to the rods 6A and 63 the inwardly projecting spigot 6As hits the operating arm 37B of pawl rotating the pawl 37 so that the spring loaded latch 35 moves towards the shutter barrel 33. When this occurs however the barrel 33 has already been rotated by the spigot 6Bs so that the latch merely hits the solid part of the shutter barrel 33. The cash box is now located in the payphone and is ready to accept coins.Fig. 3 shows the condition of the locking mechanism when the cash box is located in the payphone and ready for use in accepting coins through slot 4, slot 34 into the cointainer assembly 2 When it is required to remove the cash box from the the payphone instrument the assembly is withdrawn from the rods 6A and 63 The spigot 6Bs on rod 63 co operates with the shutter ,barrel actuator 38 to rotate the shutter barrel through 90 degrees in a clockwise direction when viewed prom the cylinder 32. This seals the coin entry slot 4 in the top of the cash box.As the shutter slot 34 in the shutter barrel 33 rotates to the horizontal position, the latch 35 under pressure from spring 36 is forced into the shutter slot 34 thereby locking the shutter barrel 33 in the closed position. The spigot Gascon the left hand priming rod will now re engage the pawl arm 37B but as the latch had already been released see Fig.3 the pawl arm rotates without effecting any operation.It should be noted that the pawl is returned to its normal position after operation in either direction under the control of a torsion spring which is not shown in any of the diagrams for sake of clarity of the drawings. Fig. 4 shows the state of the locking mechanism when the cash box has been fully removed from the rods GA and 63. The locked cash box remains in the locked state until the barrel lock 5 is opened using a key. The catch 52 is freed by the unlocking of the lock 5 due to the rotation of the lock cam 51 in an anti cloch√ßise direction through 900. This condition is depicted in Fig. 5. In addition to the freeing of the catch 52 the rotation of the lock cam 51 causes the latch mechanism to be reset to the prImed state. As the cam 51 rotates a pin 51A co operates with the latch arm 35A to drive the latch 35 against the pressure of spring 36 so that the latch is removed from the coin slot 34 and is re engaged by the pawl 37. The cash boxiocking mechanism is therefore re primed and the locking of the lock 5 returns the lock cam 51 to the state shown in Fig. 3. The shutter barrel 34 is therefore freed by the removal of the latch 35 in the primed state.However, the shutter barrel 34 is not free to rotate as it is held in the horizontal state under the control of a barrel spring 39. The spring 39 is a leaf spring which co operates with an indentation on the shutter barrel 33. The indentation can be seen on Fig. 3 at 33B and it will be realised that this indentation co operates with a projection not shown pn the spring 39. The above description has been of one embodiment only and is not intended to be limiting to the scope of the invention as defined by the clams. Alternative arrangements will readily be seen by those skilled in the art for example the embodiment of the invention used rods 63 and 6A with integral spigots to activate the shutter barrel rotation and the pa l movement, however, the mechanism could have been arranged so that one activating mechanism was used for each operation sequenced as required.
