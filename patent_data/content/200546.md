# Method of protecting a metal surface.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of protecting a metal surface 7 from corrosion, characterised by forming a protective coating 8 on said metal surface applying to said protective coating a polymerisable cationic organic material in an aqueous medium polymerising said material to form a polymer coating 9 over said protective coating. The inven tion also relates to the metal surface of an aluminium heat exchanger protected by said method.
