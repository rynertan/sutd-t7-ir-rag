# The production of haploid seed, of doubled haploids and of homozygous plant lines therefrom.

## Abstract
In a process for producing haploid seed haploids are induced in an angiosperm by applying an apomixic agent to a plant at a time which is between the occurrence of flower initiation and anthesis in an amount sufficient to cause apomixis, allowing the plant to produce seed and collecting from the seed, viable, haploid seed. The process may be used to produce doubled haploids in an angiosperm by further growing the haploid seed in an environment which fosters the development of the embryo into a plant which is capable of producing doubled haploid seed. The process enables homozygous plant lines to be obtained. The process may usefully be applied to cereal grain and forage crop plants.

## Description
THE PRODUCTION OF HAPLOID SEED, OF DOUBLED HAPLOIDS AND OFHOMOZYGOUS PLANT LINES THEREFROM This invention is concerned with the production of haploid seed, of doubled haploids and of homozygous plant lines therefrom. Haploid and doubled haploid, including polyploids, angiosperms are known to occur spontaneously. Occurrences of haploid angiosperms have been recorded in at least seventy one species, representative of thirty nine genera in sixteen different families. Kimber et al., Rot. Rev., 29 480 531 1963 . However, the spontaneous origin of haploids, whether it be by monoembryony or polyembryony of parthenogenic or androgenic origin, is unpredictable and occurs at a very low frequency. In an attempt to increase their frequency of occurrence, many techniques have been developed to induce haploidy in angiosperms.Examples of such techniques include emasculation and isolation, delayed pollination, pseudogamy by the use of abortive pollen or distant hybridization, semigamy, cytoplasmgenome interactions by chromosome elimination and alloplasmy, genetic selection techniques, culture methods, including anther culture, pollen culture and protoplast or tissue culture of haploids, and treatments by physical agents such as traumatic injuries, temperature shocks, x rays, gamma rays, radioisotopes and ultraviolet light radiations, and chemical agents. Examples of such chemicals include colchicine, maleic hydrazide, belbitan, parafluorophenylalanine, toluidene blue, nitrous oxide and chloramphenicol.A review of these techniques is given byRaghavan, Z., Experimental Embryogenesis in Vascular Plants,Chapter 15, Academic Press, 1976 and by Lacadena, J., Spontaneous and Induced Parthenogensis and Androgensis which is a chapter. in Kasha, K.J. editor , Haploids inHigher Plants Advances and Potential, University ofGuelph, Ontario, 1974. However, all of these methods of inducement are very tedious, unpredictable and most result in extremely low frequency of occurrence of haploids from any given stock.Although the culture techniques may enable a greater frequency of occurrence, they are not suitable for a number of species and are, in any event, fairly tedious, require sophisticated series of cultures to develop an embryo and ultimately a plant and may require inducement for the doubling of the haploid. Few of these techniques, and none using a chemical agent, have resulted in sufficient or consistent occurrence of haploids or doubled haploids to enable them to be utilized readily in the development of plant breeding materials or breeding programs. Additionally, abnormal wheat seed having haploidy properties has been observed after the treatment of wheat plants with a chemical hybridizing agent. Embryos isolated from these seeds were grown into plant lets on a culture utilized for the growth of haploid plants from androgenetic embryos. We have now found that haploid angiosperms can be obtained by treating plants with an apomixic agent prior to the completion of anthesis, allowing the plants to develop seed, collecting the seed having characteristics of haploid seed prior to its abortion and maintaining the seed under conditions which preserve the viability of the embryo contained in the seed. A doubled haploid is produced from the haploid by supplying an environment which fosters and maintains the growth of the embryo and its development into a doubled haploid plant. The completion of the doubling process is grossly observed in those of the flowers which set seed. These seeds are genetically stable and each seed produced represents a single seed source of a homozygous line. The present invention recognises that the timing and dosage of application of a chemical apomixic agent is important in obtaining haploids and doubled haploids, enabling their production in large numbers. The apomixic technique of the present invention is useful in plant breeding for obtaining genetically stable lines, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for inbreeding of plant lines. The obtaining of a homozygous plant can be accomplished within one generation. Thus, it is a useful technique for the development of new varieties and germplasms. additionally, due to the large number of doubled haploids which can be produced from the invention, it has utility in the development phase of breeding programs because it will allow a breeder to fix the genetic system of individual gametes in testable, reproducible form at any stage in a breeding program.Moreover, to the extent doubled haploid plants represent random gametes from their source material, the technique can be useful in inheritance studies because superior gametes will have the same opportunity as other gametes of being included in any sample of a gametic population obtained via haploids. Further, the technique can be useful in the determination of phylogenetic relationships and genetic ratios. For the purposes of this invention the following terms have the definitions given below. ,Haploid is an organism that has a gametic chromosome complement n . It includes monoploids x , diploids 2x and polyploids. The haploid may be of male and or female origin. Doubled haploid is an organism whose gametic chromosome complement has been doubled 2n Apomixis is the reproduction of an angiosperm where the sexual organs or related structures take part, but where embryos are formed without the normal union of the male and female gamete to form a zygote. The specific origin of the apomixic haploids produced by this invention is not known and is not critical to the invention. For example, the apomixic haploids may originate from parthenogenesis, androgenesis, apogamety, semigamy or by chromosomal elimination after the fusion of male and female gametes. The angiosperm plants treated to produce the haploids and doubled haploids may be either monocotyledons or dicotyledons which are either homozygous or heterozygous.The plants may be monoploid, diploid or polyploid. The invention is particularly applicable to commercially valuable crops and seeds, especially cereal crops, such as wheat, barley, corn, rice, sorghum, millets, triticale, oats and rye and forage crops, such as rye grass, bent grass, fescue, timothy and orchard grass. The apomixic agent is a chemical having the ability to cause apomixis in angiosperms.

When the ammonium group contains a substituted alkyl, substituted phenyl, or substituted phenylalkyl group, the substituents will generally be selected from halogen atoms, Cl C8Xalkyl groups, Cl C4 alkoxy groups, hydroxy groups, nitro groups, trifluoromethyl groups, cyano groups, amino groups, Cl C4Xalkylthio groups, and the like. Such substituted phenyl groups preferably have up to two such substituents.Representative ammonium cations include ammonium, dimethylammonium 2 ethylhexyl ammonium, bis 2 hydroxyethyl ammonium, t octylammonium 2 hydroxyethylammonium, morpholinium, piperidinium, 2phenethylammonium, 2 methylbenzyl ammonium, n hexylammonium, triethyl ammonium, trimethylammonium, tri n butyl ammonium, methoxy ethylammonium, diisopropylammonium, pyridinium, diallylammonium, pyrazolium, propargylammonium, dimethylhydrazinium, hydroxyammonium, methoxyammonium, dodecylammonium, octadecylammonium, 4 dichlorophenylammonium, 4 nitrobenzylammonium, benzyltrimethylammonium, 2 hydroxy ethyldimethyloctadecylammonium, 2 hydroxyethyldiethyloctylammonium, decyltrimethylammonium, hexyltriethylammonium, 4 methylbenzyltrimethylammonium, and the like. The species of plant being treated will determine the particular apomixic agent s which may be utilized. For example, an apomixic agent which can cause apomixis to occur in common wheat may not have an apomixic effect on corn or soybeans. Preferred apomixic agents for producing haploids of Graminaeae plants, particularly small grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, etc. include the following and, preferably their water soluble salts 1 4 chlorophenyl 1, 4 dihydro 4 oxo 6 methylpyridazine 3 carboxylic acid, 1 4 chlorophenyl 1, 4 dihydro 4 oxo 5 carboxymethyl 6 ethylpyridazine 3 carboxylic acid, 1 4 chlorophenyl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 5 propionyl 6 methyl pyridazine 3 carboxylic acid, 1 ethyl 6 methyl 2 4 chlorophenyl 4 oxonicotinic acid, 1 ethyl 6 methyl 2 3,4 dichlorophenyl 4 oxonicotinic acid, l 3,4 dichlorophenyl 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 5 carboxymethyl 6 methylpyridazine and 1 phenyl 1, 4 dihydro 4 oxo 5 carboxymethyl 6 ethylpyridazine as well as methyl or ethyl 1 4 chlorophenyl 1, 4 dihydro 4 oxo 6 ethylpyridazine 5 carboxylate and methyl or ethyl 1 4 bromophenyl 1, 4 dihydro 4 oxo 6 ethylpyridazine 5 carboxylate. These compounds are particularly useful for inducing the occurrence of haploids and their subsequent doubled haploids in wheat. In the application of the apomixic agent, the haploid seed is generally produced by a process which involves charging to a container or mechanical dissemination device, a composition comprising the apomixic agent and, usually, an agronomically acceptable carrier therefor. The thus charged container or mechanical dissemination device is then used to apply the apomixic agent to the plant, for example by the application of a dust or liquid spray to the plant foliage. The apomixic agent is applied to a plant prior to the occurrence of fertilization. Generally, it is applied at a time in the plant s growth which is from about flower initiation to anthesis pollen shed . It is preferred that it be applied from about the occurrence of meiosis to about anthesis. If the apomixic agent is applied prior to flower initiation, the agent is relatively less active and may cause plant injury. If the agent is applied after anthesis, haploids are not induced. The apomixic agent is applied in an amount sufficient to cause apomixis and the induction of haploids.Frequently appropriate application rates are about 0.01 to about 22 kilograms per hectare, preferably from about 0.03 to about 11 kilograms and more preferably from about 0.1 to about 6 kilograms per hectare. The rate of application will vary depending upon the particular apomixic agent used, the particular plant species being treated and the stage of growth at treatment. Generally, the later the stage of growth, up to anthesis, the less apomixic agent required. In order to apply apomixic agents to the plant, they may be applied foliarly, to the soil or, in rice crops, to the water surface. Foliar application is preferred. Generally, some sort of stimulus, e.g., pollen, is beneficial in causing the plant to produce seed after treatment with the apomixic agent. If the apomixic agent is applied prior to the occurrence of meiosis, then pollen from another plant is useful in stimulating the plant to continue its reproductive cycle and produce seed. If the apomixic agent is applied after meiosis and the plant is a self pollinator, then generally its own pollen is sufficient to stimulate seed production. The apomixic seed is identified by characteristics which are the same as those for the specific species of haploid seed occurring naturally or induced by other means.Such characteristics include, for example, morphological ones and genetic markings. For example, the apomixic seed of common wheat is flatter and smaller, containing less or no endosperm, than normal seed produced by sexual reproduction. In those instances where the haploid seed is difficult to identify by morphological characteristics, separation may be effected by the use of genetic markers, e.g., of the seed or seedling stage or by flotation techniques, etc. as described in Lacadena, J., Spontaneous and Induced Parthenogenesis and Androgenesis occurring in Kasha, K. J. editor , Haploids in Higher Plants Advances and Potential, University of Guelph, Ontario, 1974 see also the references cited therein .A haploid seed may also be identified by determining its chromosome count from a root tip taken from the embryo or plant developing from the seed. The apomixic seed is collected prior to its abortion, while the seed contains a viable embryo. It is, therefore, usually collected within about four weeks after anthesis occurs, preferably between two and three weeks after anthesis. After collection, the apomixic seed is treated in a manner to maintain the viability of the seed s embryo.Particularly in those instances where the haploid seed contains less endosperm than a normal seed of the same species, it is desirable to supply nutrients and other conditions which will foster and maintain the growth of the embryo and its subsequent development into a doubled haploid organism. This allows for a higher percentage of the haploid seeds to develop into doubled haploid plants. The use of particular nutrients and growth techniques can be readily determined by those in the art and include, for example, known nutrients such as a carbon source, minerals, amino acids, growth regulators, etc. and culture mediums such as wetted filter paper, agar, soil, etc. Such techniques are described, for example, in Raghavan, V.,Experimental Embryogenesis in Vascular Plants, AcademicPress, New York 1976 .The use of aseptic conditions, the dissection of the embryo from the seed, temperature control, regulation of day length and vernalization or other physical conditions may also be utilized to enhance the growth and doubling of the haploid. If an embryo produced by the apomixic technique of this invention fails to spontaneously double its gametic chromosome complement or if it is desired to cause the doubling more readily or more uniformly, then a doubling agent, e.g., colchicine, may be used in accordance with techniques known to those in the art. In one aspect, the present invention provides a means for obtaining homozygous lines within one generation from either a homozygous or heterozygous plant, thereby reducing the amount of time necessary for the development of germ plasms, new varieties and breeding material. For example, new homozygous lines may be obtained by subjecting a hybrid to the epomixic technique of the present invention, selecting and collecting the haploid seed, growing the embryo of the haploid seed under conditions favoring the development of a doubled haploid plant and collecting the seed produced from that plant. Even though the seed produced from the same and different plant will vary genetically, each seed will be genetically stable and represent a single seed source of homozygous line.Varieties, germ plasms and breeding materials are then obtained by selecting those plants which have the characteristics desired. An apomixic agent of the invention can be applied to the growth medium or to plants to be treated either by itself or, as is generall done, as a component in a composition or formulation which also comprises an agronomically acceptable carrier. By agronomically acceptable carriern is meant any substance which can be used to dissolve, disperse, or diffuse a compound in the composition without impairing the effectiveness of the compound and which by itself has no significant detrimental effect on the soil, equipment, crops or agronomic environment. Mixtures of the apomixic agents may also be used in any of these formulations. The compositions of apomixic agents can be either solid or liquid formulations or solutions. For example, the apomixic agents can be formulated as wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dusts, granular formulations, aerosols, or flowable emulsion concentrates. In such formulations, the apomixic agents are extended with a liquid or solid carrier and, when desired, suitable surfactants are incorporated. It is usually desirable, particularly in foliar applications, to include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, spreading agents, dispersing agents, stickers, adhesives, and the like, in accordance with agricultural practices.Examples of adjuvants which are commonly used in the art can be found in the John W. McCutcheon, Inc. publication Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual . The apomixic agents can be dissolved in any appropriate solvent. Examples of solvents which are useful in the practice of this invention include water, alcohols, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, dimethylformamide, dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like. Mixtures of these solvents can vary from about 2 to about 98 by weight with a preferred range being from about 20 to about 75 . For the preparation of emulsifiable concentrates, the apomixic agents can be dissolved in organic solvents, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, methylated naphthalene, corn oil, pine oil, o dichlorobenzene, isophorone, cylcohexanone, methyl oleate, and the like, or in mixtures of these solvents, together with an emulsifying agent or surfactant which permits dispersion in water. Suitable emulsifiers include, for example, the ethylene oxide derivatives of alkylphenols or long chain alcohols, mercaptans, carboxylic acids, and reactive amines and partially esterified polyhydric alcohols. Solvent soluble sulfates or sulfonates, such as the alkaline earth salts or amine salts of alkyl benzenesulfonates and the fatty alcohol sodium sulfates, having surface active properties can be used as emulsifiers either alone or in conjunction with an ethylene oxide reaction product.Flowable emulsion concentrates are formulated similarly to the emulsifiable concentrates and include, in addition to the above components, water and a stabilizing agent such as a water soluble cellulose derivative or a water soluble salt of a polyacrylic acid. The concentration of the active ingredient in emulsifiable concentrates of usually about 10 to 60 by weight and in flowable emulsion concentrates, this can be as high as about 75 . Wettable powders suitable for spraying, can be prepared by admixing the compound with a finely divided solid, such as clays, inorganic silicates and carbonates, and silicas and incorporating wetting agents, sticking agents, and or dispersing agents in such mixtures. l e 4 concentration of active ingredients in such formulations is usually in the range of about 20 to 98 hy weight, preferably about 40 to 75 . A dispersing agent may generally constitute about 0.5 to about 3 by weight of the composition, and a wetting agent may generally constitute from about 0.1 to about 5 by weight of the composition. Dusts can be prepared by mixing the apomixic agents of the invention with finely divided inert solids which may be organic or inorgaic in nature. Materials useful for this purpose include, for example, botanical flours, silicas, silicates, carbonates and clays. One convenient method of preparing a dust is to dilute a wettable powder with a finely divided carrier. Dust concentrates containing about 20 to 80 of the active ingredient are commonly made and are subsequently diluted to about 1 to 10 by weight use concentration. Granular formulations can be prepared by impregnating a solid such as granular Fuller s earth, vermiculite, ground corn cobs, seed hulls, including bran or other grain hulls, or similar material. A solution of one or more of the apomixic agents in a volatile organic solvent can be sprayed or mixed with the granular solid and the solvent then removed by evaporation. The granular material can have any suitable size, with a preferable size range of 16 to 60 mesh. The active compound will usually comprise about 2 to 15 by weight of the granular formulations. Salts of the apomixic agents can be formulated as aqueous formulations. The salt will typically comprise about 0.05 to about 75 by weight preferably about 10 to about 50 , of the aqueous formulation. These compositions can also be further diluted with water if desired prior to actual application. In some applications, the activity of these compositions can be enhanced by incorporating into the composition an adjuvant such as glycerin, methylethyl cellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate, polypropylene glycol, polyacrylic acid, polyethylene sodium malate, polyethylene oxide, or the like. The adjuvant will generally comprise about 0.1 to about 5 by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 2 of the composition. Such compositions can also optionally include an agronomically acceptable surfactant. The apomixic agents can be applied as sprays by methods commonly employed, such as conventional hydraulic sprays, aerial sprays, and dusts. For low volume applications, a solution of the compound is usually used.The dilution and volume of application will usually depend upon such factors as the type of equipment employed, the method of application, the area to be treated and the type and stage of development of the crop being treated. The following Examples of some preferred embodiments of the invention are given for the purposes of illustration only. EXAMPLESExample 1 A spring wheat variety, Fielder, was grown under greenhouse conditions. A portion of the plants were treated with potassium 1 4 chlorophenyl 1, 4 dihydro 4 oxo 6 methylpyridazine 3 carbonate apomixic agent at dosage rates of about 0.28, 1.1, 2.2, and 4.4 kilograms kg of the apomixic agent per hectare ha . The apomixic aqent was formulated with 0.25 volume volume percent Trito AG 98 low foam spray adjuvant which is a nonionic surfactant solution of octylphenoxypolyethoxy ethanol and isopropanol .The apomixic agent was applied to the wheat at different growth stages, i.e., the initiation of jointing Stage 6 , second node detectable Stage 7 , flag leaf just visible Stage 8 , flag leaf ligule just visible Stage 9 , flag leaf half extended Stage 9.5 , flag leaf sheath fully extended Stage 10 , head or spike fully emergenced Stage 10.5 and anthesis. At anthesis, selected spikes of these treated plants were cross pollinated with pollen from untreated wheat of a different line. Two controls were utilized. One was Fielder plants which were not treated with the apomixic agent. The other control was similarly untreated and its flowers hand emasculated and cross pollinated with pollen from untreated wheat of a different line. All the other flowers from both treated and untreated plants were allowed to self pollinate, if viable pollen were present. Twenty days after pollination anthesis , phytotoxicity to the wheat spikes was determined and subjective observations were made on the ovary, embryo, and seed appearances. All of the ovaries were normal in appearance. The remainder of the results are given inTable I. The seeds containing haploid embryos were shriveled and flat having a dull blue green color compared to the control seeds which were plump having e shiny light green appearance. The seeds containing haploid embryos also contained watery endosperm which was lacking in starch and their embryos were generally larger and more developed than those of the control seeds. Embryos from the haploid seeds were dissected from the seeds and placed on moist filter paper saturated with a sucrose solution where they germinated. The morphological characteristics of the haploid seed, its embryo and plant which developed therefrom were typical of the characteristics which have been observed for naturally occurring wheat haploids.

Example 2 Spring wheat variety Fielder was grown under greenhouse conditions. A portion of the plants were treated with potassium 1 4 chlorophenyl 1 ,4 dihydro 4 oxo 6 methylpyridazine 3 carbonate apomixic agent at about 0.6, 1.1, 2.2, and 4.4 kilograms of apomixic agent per hectare. The apomixic agent was formulated with 0.4 volumeXvolume percent Trito AG 98 low foam adjuvant . The apomixic agent was applied to the plants at times which averaged from three days prior to anthesis to four days after anthesis. Three controls were utilized. One was Fielder plants which were not treated with any spray. The second control was sprayed with only 0.4 volume volume percent Tritorr AG 98 at three days before and after anthesis. The third set of control plants had its flowers hand emasculated and then cross pollinated with Fielder which was treated with 4.4 kilograms per hectare of the apomixic agent three days prior to anthesis. Fourteen days after anthesis, seeds were collected from the florets of the spikes of the wheat plants and the average weight of the seeds was determined. The results are reported in Table 2. Although some of the results are given as being after anthesis, some of these florets from which seed was obtained actually underwent anthesis after treatment with the apomixic agent. This was due to the fact that anthesis on the same spike does not occur in every floret on the same day.

Example 3 Different hard red winter wheats third generation from their original crosses were vernalized at 20C for fifty days and then planted in six inch pots and grown in a greenhouse until the plants varied in growth from stage 9.0 to late boot about stage 10 . Stages in this example refer to the commonly used and known Feekes scale,Feekes, W., De tançe en haar milieu Versl. techn. TarweComm. 12 523 888 1941 . At this time, the plants were sprayed with potassium 1 4 chlorophenyl l,4 dihydro 4 oxo 6 methylpyridazine 3 carbonate apomixic agent at dosage rates of about 1.1, 2.2 and 3.3 kolograms kg of the apomixic agent per hectare ha . Each tiller of each plant was tagged and identified as to its growth stage at the time of treatment.About two weeks after the treatment, anthesis occurred with seed set occurring in some of the heads. About twenty one days after anthesis, immature seeds having the characteristics of apomixic seed, e.g., dimpled seeds having irregular scutella and endosperms which were clear and liquidy, were removed from the heads, the embryos removed from these seeds and placed on Miller s soybean callus medium, a nutrient sterile agar containing indole acetic acid and salts and allowed to grow under room conditions. The embryos which grew and developed roots and shoots were transplanted to test tubes containing freshMillers medium. The tubes containing the embryos were placed in an environmental chamber at about 700F 210C and exposed to fourteen hours of daylight and ten hours of darkness to allow for their further development. After the plantlets developed good roots and about a three inch shoot, they were placed in a vernalizing chamber at 20C for fifty days. Upcn removal from the vernalizing chamber, the plant letts were potted in soil and grown under greenhouse conditions for about five days. At this time, root tip samples were taken from each plant to obtain chromosome counts. The soil was brushed and rinsed with water from the root tip samples. The root tips from each plant were placed in a vial about one third full of a saturated aqueous solution of 1 bromonaphthalene. The roots were left in the bromonaphthalene solution for about 3 to 4 hours. The roots were then transferred to another set of vials containing approximately 1 milliliter of 3 parts absolute ethyl alcohol and 1 part glacial acetic acid and left there for a little more than an hour. They were then transferred to another set of vials containing 5N hydrochloric acid for about 5 1 2 to about 7 minutes.After which the roots were removed and washed in distilled water and placed in another set of vials containing a small amount of feulgen stain. The feulgen stain was prepared by pouring 100 milliliters of boiling water over 0.5 grams of basic fuchsin in a flask and shaking for a few minutes until dissolved. The solution was then cooled to about 500C and filtered into a brown stock bottle and 15 milliliters of 1N hydrochloric acid was added. The solution was cooled further to about 28 C and about 1.5 grams of potassium metabisulfite was added and was dissolved with shaking. After refrigerating overnight, about 1 to 2 tablespoons of activated decolorizing charcoal were added.The solution was shaken well and filtered into another brown stock bottle. The vials were corked and stored in a refrigerator until the chromosome counts were taken. Each of the root tips was removed from the feulgen containing vials, placed on a glass slide and approximately half of the stained areas were cut off. A drop of acetocarmine stain was placed on the remaining sample and a cover slip was placed over each sample. The roots were squashed by placing gentle pressure on the cover slip. The slides were then viewed under a microscope and the chromosomes of single cells were counted. In addition to doing a chromosome count on the above lines of seeds which were treated with the apomixic agent, chromosome counts were also taken on untreated lines. These seeds were placed in petri dishes on a piece of moist blotter paper with the germ side up. The seeds were allowed to germinate at room temperature for about 48 hours until the primary root was about 1 2 inch long. Samples of the primary roots of each plant were taken and chromosomal counts conducted as above described.The results of the chromosome counts are given below in Table 3. No results were obtained on untreated seed line 5 because no cells were observed having countable chromosomes. Since the normal chromosome count of a wheat cell of the hard red winter wheat lines tested is 42, the obtainment of chromosome counts of 21 are very indicative of haploid wheat plants and those counts between 21 and 42 are very indicative that the chromosomes are undergoing endoreduplication, which upon completion, for example, at a later stage of the plant s development, results in doubled haploid plants.

For example, the phenyl substituted 4 oxo thio nicotinates can be prepared as follows when Z, R1, Y, X and n are as defined above, and 1 when R2 is the phenyl group, R3 is a hydrogen atom, alkyl group, a halogen atom or the phenyl group, is hydrogen or an alkyl group, the compounds can be prepared by the reaction of a suitably substituted 4hydroxy 2 pyrone of the formula EMI30.1 wherein R4 is as defined above with a benzoylhalide of the formula EMI30.2 wherein X is as defined above in the presence of an acid scavenger such as pyridine, triethylamine and the like, at temperatures from about 0 to about 1000 to from a 4 benzoyloxy 2 pyrone of the formula EMI31.1 wherein R4 and X and n are as defined above. This reaction is discussed in E. Marcus,J. F. Stephen, J. K. Chan, Journal of lieterocyclic Chemistry, p. 13, 1966. This benzoate can undergo aFries type rearrangement with anhydrous aluminum chloride at elevated temperatures to give the product of the formula EMI31.2 as discussed in the E. Marcus, et al. reference, ibid.The benzoylpyrone of the formula VI above can then be reacted with a suitable alcohol ROH wherein R is an alkyl in the presence of a similarly substituted trialkylorthoformate RO 3CH utilizing an acid catalyst selected from the group consisting of sulfuric, hydrochloric, trifluoroacetic, acetic, hydrobromic, and the like, at temperatures from about 0 to about 2000C to form the 3 carboxy 4 pyrone of the formula EMI32.1 The 3 carboxy 4 pyrone esters of formula VII can be reacted with any suitably substituted amine of the formula R1 NH2 VIII to yield a 1 alkyl 2 aryl oxonicotinate ester of formula IX .EMI32.2 This reaction is generally carried out in an inert solvent, such as toluene, xylene, benzene, chloroform, methylene chloride, methanol, ethanol or the like, at room temperature or at a temperature at which the water formed during the reaction can be removed by azeotropic distillation, using about 0 to 5 by weight of an acid catalyst such as p toluenesulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, or the like.The free acid, its salts, amides, and other esters can then be prepared by conventional techniques. The reaction of 3 carboxy 4 pyrone ester of formula VII with excess amine of formula VIII in methanol or ethanol at 0 500C also results in the formation of a 2 1 amine pyrone adduct of formula X .EMI33.1 Compound X can be converted to IX by hydrolysis with dilute aqueous acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric, trifluoroacetic or methanesulfonic at 00 500C.Alternately, 2 1 adduct X can be alkylated, halogenated or arylated with an alkyl halide, molecular chlorine or bromine or an activated aryl halide, respectively, in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, benzene, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether and the like to provide a material of formula XI wherein R5 is an alkyl group EMI33.2 This compound can be hydrolyzed in aqueous acids at 0 50 C as described above to yield the corresponding 1,5 dialkyl 2 aryl 4 oxonicotinate ester of formula IX where R3 is an alkyl. The oxonicotinic acid esters produced in the above reactions can be converted to the free acids by hydrolysis with a strong base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide and the like followed by neutralization with a strong acid.

The pyridazinones of the invention in which R6 is a halogen atom can be prepared by reacting the corresponding pyridazinones in which R6 is a hydrogen atom with one equivalent of a halogenating agent such as bromine, chlorine, sulfuryl bromide, sulfuryl chloride, or the like in a suitable inert solvent such as hexane, benzene, ethylene dichloride, methanol, or the like, at a temperature of about 0 to 500C, preferably at room temperature. 2 When R6 isEMI47.1 and A is hydrogen, alkyl or aralkyl and the remainder of the substituents are as defined above, the following synthesis route can be used EMI47.2 EMI48.1 EMI49.1 Salts of the pyridazinones of formulas 4, 10, 14 and 15, and their 5 halo analogues can be prepared by conventional techniques, such as by neutralIzation with an appropriate inorganic or organic base, in a solvent such as water or methanol. Esters of the pyridazinones of formulas 4, 10, 14 and 15 are prepared by esterification with a suitable alcohol, preferably a C1 C12 alkanol. One convenient technique is a Fischer esterification, using anhydrous hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid as a catalyst and the alcohol as the solvent. This esterification is generally carried out at about 350 to about 15000, optionally using an inert cosolvent such as methylene chloride, ethylene chloride, dimethyl ether, toluene, xylene, or the like. Another convenient esterification technique is the reaction of the pyridazinone acylhalide formed as above with an appropirate alcohol utilizing the alcohol or any inert cosolvent for the reaction media. Alternatively a thionyl halide can be utilized to first form a halosulfinite with the appropriate alcohol and this halosulfinite can then be reacted with the pyridazinone carboxylic acid to form the appropriate ester. These esterification procedures can be carried out at about 0 to about 800C, The alcohol of the ester can also be used as the solvent in this reaction. Yet another esterification technique involves the use of a halo carboxylate to form a pyridazinone acylanhydride followed by either thermal decomposition to eliminate carbon dioxide and form the desired ester or addition of an equimolar or excess amount of the alcohol of the ester, to form the desired ester. This reaction can initially be run at about OOC and the temperature increased until the evoluation of carbon dioxide has ceased. This reaction is carried out in the presence of an acid scavenger in an inert solvent. The thioesters of the invention can be prepared as above by the replacement of a thioalcohol. The pyridazinone carbamides of the invention can be prepared by standard synthetic routes such as the reaction of the acylhalide discussed above with an appropriate amine in an inert solvent at about 0 to about 1500C. Another convenient amination route utilizes the reaction of the Fridazinone carboxylic acid with an appropriate halocarboxylate to first form an acylanhydride which in turn is reacted with an appropriate amine at temperatures at about 250 to about 110 C in an inert solvent again with the evolution of carbon dioxide to form the appropriate carbamide. The oxo pyridazines and oxo nicotinates are readily converted to their thio analogs using conventional techniques.
