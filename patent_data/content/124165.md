# STEAM STRIPPING AN AQUEOUS SLURRY OR SOLUTION OF PROTEIN TO REMOVE OFF FLAVORS

## Abstract
A method for removing lipid oxidation off flavors from vegetable proteins, especially soy protein used in soy beve rages, is disclosed herein. In this method, an aqueous slurry or solution of protein is formed into a film. This film is stripped with steam at a temperature of from about 200 93 to about 400 F 204 C to remove off flavors from the protein. The off flavor laden steam is then separated from the stripped film. The stripped film is preferably cooled to a temperature of from about 90 32 to about 180 F 82 C within about 1 to about 100 seconds after steam stripping begins.This method provides sufficiently bland soy protein without the need of recycling the slurry or solution as in prior methods.
