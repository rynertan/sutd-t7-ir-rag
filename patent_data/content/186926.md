## Description
This invention relates to a process for grafting a vinylaromatic monomer and an acrylic monomer on polybutadiene by emulsion polymerization. The prior art, as represented by US A 3 442 979 discloses a process for the preparation of graft polymers on the basis of polybutadiene by first adding part of an emulsion of polybutadiene, styrene and acrylonitrile and other compounds to a reaction vessel, starting the polymeriza tion and then adding the rest of the emulsion, the particle size of the polybutadiene latex being from 0,08 micrometer to 0,304 micrometer, said latex being used as the basis for the acrylonitrile styrene graft. DE A 2 038 738 and FR A 2 051 451 disclose processes for the grafting of a butadiene polymer with a particle size range of 0,2 to 0,6 micrometer by first grafting 20 to 80 of the acrylonitrile styrene monomers onto the polybutadiene and, when at least one half of that amount has been converted, adding the remaining amount of the acrylonitrile styrene monomers. Moreover, EP A 0 000 462 discloses a process of graft polymerization in which the technologies of emulsion polymerization and polymerization in suspension are sequentially used. In order to obtain better products and a smoother processing run, the present invention provides a process for grafting a vinylaro matic monomer and an acrylic monomer on polybutadiene by emulsion polymerizing, in the presence of a monomodal polybutadiene latex having a particle diameter comprised between 0,08µm and 0,25µm, to which a stabilizer emulsifier has been added, a mixture of a vinylaromatic monomer and an acrylic monomer, adding a further portion of monomodal polybutadiene and a further amount of said vinylaromatic and said acrylic monomer when the reaction conver sion is between 70 and 90 of the supplied monomers, in the presence of from 0,01 to 3 by weight, relative to the reactive compounds, of a water soluble initiator, and completing the emulsion polymerization, characterized in that said water soluble initiator is activated by a reducing agent selected from among sodium bisulphite and salts or complexes of iron and low valence transition metals, preferably Co, Ni and Cu. The polybutadiene latex useable in the grafting polym erization according to the present invention comprises a monomodal polymer characterized by an extremely narrow granulometric distribution, the average particle diameter being comprised within the range of from 0,08 µm to 0,25 µm 800 to 2500 A and, preferably, within the range of from 0,13 µm to 0,16 µm 1300 to 1600 A . In the first polymerization step, up to 90 is used of the overall amount of polybutadiene which shall enter into the end composition of graft polymer, the residual a mount being added during the second step, when the graft ing polymerization reaction has exceeded the 70 90 con version level, relatively to monomers introduced. The grafting in emulsion is favoured by the presence of stabilizers emulsifiers, directly inside polybutadiene latex. Stabilizer systems are those usually used to that pur pose, such, e.g., the soaps of fatty acids, alkyl or ar yl alkyl sulphonates, the salts of resin acids of parti cular interest has resulted the use of a potassium alkyl sulphonate, and the sodium salt of disproportionated resin acid. The monomers to be polymerized and grafted can be in troduced throughout the step of emulsion polymerization they can be introduced as well separately or as mixtures, continuously or as sequential batches, as such or suitably emulsified. As mentioned, the grafting polymerization envisages the use, according to what just mentioned, of a mixture com prising at least a vinylaromatic derivative, and at least an acryl or methacryl derivative. Among vinylaromatic derivatives, styrene, α methyl styrene, substituted styrenes can be mentioned above all, styrene. Among acryl or methacryl derivatives to exemplifying purposes acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, eth yl acrylate, and corresponding methacrylates, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile can be mentioned. 0f particular interest results the use of styrene ac rylonitrile and styrene acrylonitrile α methylstyrene, in particular in view of the subsequent use of graft polymer for the preparation of ABS resins. In the just mentioned case, the monomers are used in weight ratios, styrene acrylonitrile, ranging from 60 40 to 80 20, preferably of 70 30. The reaction is carried out at a temperature comprised within the range of from 50 to 80 C, in the presence of an initiator selected among water soluble initiators, tradi tionally efficacious in emulsion polymerization, of per oxide type potassium persulphate or ammonium persulphate, organic peroxides, hydroperoxides and peracids. The amount of initiator must be comprised within the range of from 0.001 to 3.0 , and preferably of from 0.005 to 1.0 of the reactive compounds, by wieght particularly indicated has resulted to be use of complex redox system Fe Of course, any other catalyst known for this type of reaction can be used to accomplish the grafting polymer ization reaction according to the present invention. Chain transfer agents are used to adjust graft copol ymer s molecular weight, and to control polymer fluidity. The most commonly used are straight or branched mercaptans, thioethers, α methylstyrene dimers, certain olefinic com pounds and terpenic derivatives. The amount of chain transfer agent must be comprised within the range of from 0.001 to 1.0. by weight. When the partial conversion of monomers supplied has reached the level of 70 90 by weight, the addition of the residual amount of monomodal polybutadiene latex is start ed up to 20 of the total to be used at maximum . Such polydutadiene can have a granulometry with mode centre different from the one initially charged, but al ways with distribution monomodal and comprised within the range as defined. Together with polybutadiene, additional amounts of the same monomers as used in the first step are added. The reaction temperature, the operating modalities, the emulsifier agents and the catalysts are the same as provided for the carrying out of the first step. When the conversion exceeds the 94 96 level, the reaction is stopped by means of the addition of a suit able inhibitor e.g., hydroxylamine sulphate . The process mentioned, being the object of the pres ent invention, allows graft copolymers containing a poly butadiene amount comprised within the range of from 10 to 70 , preferably of from 40 to 60 , to be obtained.
