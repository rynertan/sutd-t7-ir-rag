# Apparatus for positioning a head relative to a magnetic disc.

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided for loading a head 36 onto a spinning disc and unloading the head 36 from the spinning disc so that contact between the head 36 and the disc is essentially prevented. The apparatus includes a Whitney size head 36 joined to the flexure of a Whitney type suspension arm 28 . A triangular shaped ramp 44 is fixed to a face of the suspension arm 28 for engagement with a stationary cam 50 . The stationary cam 50 is located along the path of movement of the head 36 , suspension arm 28 and flexure. The contact between the cam 50 and ramp 44 causes movement of the head 36 relative to the disc. In the case of loading the head 36 , this movement results in a desired approach of the head 36 towards the disc and enhanced loading of the head 36 onto the disc.
