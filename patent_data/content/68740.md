## Description
RECOMBINANT DNA CLONING VECTORS AND THE EUKXRYOTIC AND PROKARYOTIC TRANSFORMANTS THEREOF The present invention concerns novel recombinant DNA cloning vectors that convey hygromycin B and G418 resistance to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The invention further concerns transformants of the aforementioned vectors. The present invention is particularly important because it solves the problem of how to identify, manipulate, and stabilize cloned DNA sequences that lack a selectable function in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Heretofore, the development and exploitation of recombinant DNA technology in eukaryotic culls has bee.n retarded and made difficult because of 1 the general lack of suitable cloning vectors that contain markers that are selectable in eukaryotic cells 2 the inability to quickly amplify desired DNA sequences in eukaryotic cells and 3 the slow generation time of eukaryotic cells in culture. It has now been discovered that these prob lems are solved by a recombinant DNA cloning vector comprising a a eukaryotic promoter, b one or to different structural genes and associated control sequence that convey re sistance to either or both antibiotics hygro mycin B and G4l8 when trans o ned into a host cell that is sensitive to either or both antibiotics for which resistance is conveved, said host cell being susceptible to trans formation, cell division, and culture, and c a prokaryotic replica, said replicon being functional when sai host cell ts prokaryotic, subject to the limitations that the one or two structural genes and associated control sequence are adjacent to and, in a eukaryotic host cell, transcribed from the eukaryotic promoter, that a single gene and associated control sequence conveys resistance to either but not both hygromycin B and G418, and that the gene conveying resistance to G418 does not code for the enzyme phosphotransferase, since said vector is functional and selectable in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.Consequently, DNA sequences that are cloned onto the present versatile vectors can be conventionally manipulated and amplified in prokaryotic cells, thus avoiding the inconvenience and problems of doing the procedures in eukaryotic cells. Moreover, since the present vectors are both functional and selectable in eukaryotic cells, the vectors can be transformed following manipulation and amplification, directly into eukaryotic hosts without additional modification This is not only advantageous but represents a significant advance in the technical art. The ability to clone DNA into euaryotic host cells and to readily select the transformants is important for the further and more sophisticated development of recombinant DNA technology. Since transformation, and consequently acquisition of plasmid DNA, is a. very low frequency event, such a functional test is a practical necessity for determining which cell s , of among the millions of cells, has acquired the plasmid DNA.This is important because DNA sequences that are non selectable can be inserted onto the vectors to cause insertional inactivation of a particular antibiotic resistance gene. Therefore, upon transforma tion, cells containing the vector and the particular DNA sequence of interest can be isolated by appropriate antibiotic selection. The present vectors are particularly useful because they are highly versatile and can be transformed and selected in any hygromycin B or G418 sensitive eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell that can divide and take up DNA.This is important because to date, most progress in the recombinant DNA art has involved the production of eukaryotic polypeptides such as, for example, proinsulin, insulin A chain, insulinB chain, human growth hormone, bovine growth hormone, interferon, somatostatin, thymosin al, and the like, in prokaryotic hosts. Prokaryotic cells are incapable cf correctly attaching sugar moieties to eukaryotic pclypeptides. Therefore, the production of post t nsia tionally modified eukaryotic polypepta as, such as the glycosylated polypeptides, by recombinant DNA techniques is not possible without a eukaryotic host and appropriate eukaryotic recombinant DNA cloning vectors. The present vectors fill this need and broaden the scope and application of recombinant DNA technology.Consequently, the commercial production of both unmodified and post translationally modified proteins in eukaryotic cells is enhanced. For purposes of the present invention as claimed herein, the following terms are as defined below.Structural Gene a DNA sequence that codes for a polypeptide.Control Element a DNA sequence that i ects and regulates the transcription and exp ess on o a structural gene.Eukaryotic Promoter a DNA sequence that in part promotes and regulates the expression of a structural gene in a eukaroytic cell.Prokaryotic Replicon a DNA sequence that controls and regulates the replication of DNA in a prokaryotic cell.Recombinant DNA cloning Vector any agent, including but not limited to plasmids, bacteriophages, and viruses, consisting of a DNA molecule to which one or more additional DNA segments can or have been added.Transformation the introduction of DNA into a recipient host cell that changes the genotype and consequently results in a stable and heritable change in the recipient cell. Insertional isomer one of the two or more possible recombinant DNA molecules formed when a DNA fragment is inserted at one of two or more compowible sites on the recipient DNA. The present vectors are constructed by preparing a DNA sequence having one or two aifferent structural genes and associated control sequence that convey resistance to either or both of antibiotics hygromycin B and G418 by a process which comprises treating plasmid pKC203 with a Bg1II restriction enzyme and isolating the 7.5kb BglII restriction fragment that conveys resistance to both said antibiotics or b BASIL and SalI restriction enzyme and isolat ing the 2.75kb Sal BglII restriction fragment that conveys resistance to both said antibiotics or c BglII and SacI restriction enzyme and iso lating the 1.51kb SacI BalII restriction fragment that conveys resistance to anti biotic hygromycin B or d Sall and EcoRI restriction enzyme and isolat ing the 1.65kb EcoRI SalI restriction fragment that conveys resistance to antibiotic G418.The DNA sequence thus obtained is ligated onto a secondDNA sequence comprising a eukaryotic promoter and, if need be, a prokaryotic replicor. The DNA sequence obtained upon ligation is closed to form a plasmid which may be stabilized and maintained by transforming the plasmid into a host cell, culturing the transformed host in the presence of antibiotic hygromycin B or antibiotic G418, and selecting the surviving cells. The present invention, as exemplified herein, exploits bacterial plasmid DNA that confers resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics hygromycin B and G118, for constructing novel plasmids that contain and express the resistance in hygromycin B or G418 sensitive eu.kary otic and prokaryotic host cells. Thus, the present invention is useful for cloning DNA into vitally any type of cell. Furthermore, the ability of the vectors exemplified herein to confer resistance to antibiotics that are toxic in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells also provides a functional test for selecting and stabilizing cells that have acquired te vectors. The particular bacterial plasmid DNA sequence used in the present illustrative constructions, is the 7.Skb BglII restriction fragment, or derivatives thereof, of plasmid pKC203. Plasmid pKC203 Is approximately 15kb in size and can be isolated readily from . ccliJR225 by conventional procedures. Stain E. coli JR225 is both known in the art Davies and O Connor, 973, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 14 1 69 , and also deposited and made part of the stock culture collection of the American Type Culture Collection,Rockville, Maryland, from which it is available to the public without restriction under the number ATCC 3112. A restriction and functional map of plasmid KC203 is presented in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings.Figure 1 and all subsequent figures are not drawn toScale The 75kb BqlII restriction fragment of pKC203 comprises the structural genes and control elements for expression of resistance to antibiotics hygromycin B and G418. This fragment was ligated onto plasmid pSV5 gpt, a known plasmid whose construction is described in Mulligan and Berg, 1980, Science 209 4463 1422. Plasmid pSV5 gpt is approximately 9.3kb and contains both the origin of replication and the ampicillin resistance marker of plasmid pBR322 and also a functional SV40 early promoter which controls the transcription of a gene coding for xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gpt . A restriction site and functional map of plasmid pSVS gpt is presented inFigure 2 of the accompanying drawings.As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, plasmid pSV5 gpt can repLicate both in E. coli and also in eukaryotic cells such as, for example, mammalian cells. Moreover, the unique Bg1II restriction site in plasmid pSVS gpt allows for the direct ligation with the 7.5kb 1II restriction fragment of plasmid pKC203. Thus, the hygromycin B and G418 resistance conferring 7.5kb fragment can be ligated onto BglII treated plasmid pSV5 gpt. Since two possible orientations of the 7.Skb fragment are equally probable, the ligation of the 7.5kb fragment onto plasmid pSV5 gpt results in plasmids of two types, designated herein as plasmids pKC214 and pKC215.Restriction and functional maps of plasmids pKC214 and pC2l5 are presented respectively in Figures 3 and 4 of the accompanying drawings. In the illustrative plasmids pKC214 and pKC215, the eukaryotic promoter is adjacent to the genes, including the associated control elements, for hygromycin B and G418 resistance and is exemplified by the SV40 early promoter. The eukaryotic promoter controls the transcription and in part regulates the expression of the resistance genes when transformed into eukaryotic. host cells. In addition, the present plasmids undergo chromosomal integration in eukaryotic hosts and therefore replicate along with and as part of the chromosomes during normal eukaryotic cell division. Although the eukaryotic promoter herein exemplified in the illustrative plasmids pKC214 and pKC215 is the SV40 early promoter O Hara et al., 1981, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 78 3 1527, and Mulli gan and Berg, 1980, Sci 209 1422 many other eukaryotic promoters can also be used. Other illustrative eukaryotic promoters include, but are not limited to, theSV40 late promoter Hamer and Leder, 1979, Nature 281 35 , HSVITK promoter Pellicer et al., 1973, Cell 14 133 , adenovirus promoter Thummel and Tjian, 1981,Cell 23 825 , adenovirus 2 Ad 2 late promoter Sol nick, 198i, Cell 24 135 , polyoma promoter Colantuoni et al., 1980, Proc. Nat. Acad.Sci. üsA 77 7 3850 , mouse sarcoma virus promoter VanBeveren et al. 198i, Nature 289 258 , yeast trp 1 promoter Stinchcomb et al,. 1979, Nature 282 39 , yeast leu 2 promoter Ratzkin and Carbon, 1977, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 74 2 487, yeast his 3 promoter Broach et al., 1979, Gene 8 121 , the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase promoter, and the yeast cytochrome c promoter Guarente and Ptashne, 1981,Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 78 4 2199 . While the construction of the illustrative plasmids pKC214 and pCK215 involved a BglII insertion into the pSV5 gpt gene downstream from the early SV40 promoter, other analogous constructions involving one or more of the above listed eukaryotic promoters can be made. For example1 a BslII linear DNA fragment containing the hygromycin B and G418 resistance genes can be obtained from plasmid pRC203, or a derivative thereof, by treating the plasmid with BglII restriction enzyme according to conventional procedures.This fragment can be used directly or synthetic DNA linkers, known in the art, can be ligated to the resistance conferring fragment and the thus prepared fragment can be cloned downstream to an appropriate eukaryotic promoter such as, for example, the Ad 2 or the yeast cytochrome c promoter. Upon ligation with a prokaryotic replicon, these constructions, exemplified herein by plasmids pGDI, pGD2, pGD3, and pGD4, are functional in eukaryotic and rokaryotic host cells and are thus within the scope of the present invention, Moreover, it is understood and will be apparent to those skilled in the art that additional constructions involving different eukaryotic promoters can be made and that some eukaryotic promoters and constructions are pre ferried over others or use in certain hosts. The particular hygromycin B and G418 resistance genes and control elements, exemplified in illustrative plasmids pKC214, pKC215, pGDl, pGD2, pGD3 and pGD4, comprise the 7.5kb BglII fragment of plasmid pKC203. Moreover, within this BglII fragment, the DNA sequence that codes for resistance has been further localized to the 2.5kb SalI BglII fragment. A restriction and functional map of the 2.Skb SalI BglII fragment is presented as part of plasmid pKC222 inFigure 5 of the accompanying drawings. Plasmid pKC222 is useful for isolating the individual genes and control elements that confer resistance to particular antibiotics.For example, the 1.51Xb Bg1II SacI fragment of plasmid pKC222 comprises the hygromycin B resistance gene and control element while the 1.65kbECORI SALI fragment comprises the gene and control.element that confers resistance to G418. Furthermore, it is believed that the gene and associated control element that confers resistance to G418 also simulta neously confers resistance to antibiotics apramycin and tobramycin in sensitive hosts such as, for example, coli. Therefore, recombinant DNA cloning vectors that confer resistance to one, more than one, or all of the antibiotics can be constructed by cloning an appro priate plasmid pKC203 or pKC222 DNA fragment downstream to an appropriate eukaryotic promoter. Upon being provided with a prokaryotic replicon, the vectors, exemplified herein by plasmids pGD10 pGD11, pGG12, pG13, pGDl4, and pGD15, are functional in oth eukarvotic and prokaryotic host cells and ar thus with n te scope of the present invention. It will be understood that the present invention is in no way limited by te above postulate additional resistance conferring activity of the G418 resistance gene The 7.5kb BglII fragment of plasmid pKC203 also contains a prokaryotic replicon and therefore can self ligated to form a plasmid.The resulting plasmd, designated as pSC701, is functional in E coli and is useful for generating derivative plasmidsEMI10.1 useful as starting materials. Thus, plasmid pSC701 DNA can be HaeII digested and then ligated to produce plasmids pKC257 and pCK259. Plasmid pCK257 is 4.2kb and confers resistance to hygromycin B while plasmld pKC259 is 5.0kb and confers resistance to both hygromycin B and apramycin. Sau3AI digestion of plasmid pKC257 DNA followed byEMI10.2 ligation results in a still smaller plasmid, designated as pKC261. This plasmid also confers resistance to hygromycin B. The above derivative plasmids are functional in E. coli and are useful as starting material for constructing vectors of the present invention. Thus, insertion of plasmid pKC259 into pSV5 gpt results in plasmids pL0314 and pL0315 insertion of plasmid pKC257 into pSC3 gpt results in plasmids pL0316 and pL0317 and insertion of plasmid pKC261 into pSV5 gpt results in plasmids pL0318 and pL0319. All of the aforemen tioned pLO plasmids are functional in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells and thus are within the scope of the present invention. Additional plasmid starting materials can also be constructed. or example, insertion of the plac containing HaeII restriction fragment of plasmid pUR222, the construction of which is disclosed in Ruther, 1981, Nucleic Acids Research 9 4087 , into plasmid pKC261 results in plasmid pKC275. The latter plasmid is 3.6kb, confers resistance to hygromycin B, and can be inserted into plasmid pSV5 gpt to form illustrative plasmids pL0320 and pL0321.Furthermore, insertion of a 2 DNA containing restriction fragment of plasmid YEp24 into pKC259 results in plasmid pKC264, insertion of the 2.5kb BglII SalI fragment of pKC259 into appropriately cut YEp24 results in plasmid pKC273, and insertIon of the 3.2Xb PstI fragment of plasmid pKC264 into pBR322 results in plasmid pL0378.Both plasmids pL0378 and pKC273 are functional in yeast and E. coli and consequently are within the scope of the present invention. Construction of the aforementioned and other vectors using the foregoing plasmid starting materials is further and more specifically disclosed in Examples 25 to 42 below. It will be understood that those of ordinary skill can construct or isolate still other DNA sequences that also confer resistance to hygromycin 3 and G418, either individually or in combination, and that these sequences can be used in place of the resistance genes and control elements exemplified herein. Moreover, functional derivatives of the 7.5 kb BglII fragment or the 2.Skb SalI BglII subfragment can e constructed by adding, eliminating, or substituting certain nucleotides in accordance with the genetic code Those of ordinary skill will understand tat use of such deriv natives and also other hygromycin 3 and 3413 conferring DNA segments results n vectors hat ate within tne scope of the present invention. Although the prokaryotic replicon exemplified herein in the illustrative plasmlds is the plasmid pBR322 replicon, many other replicons can also be used for making similar constructions. Other illustrative prokaryotic replicons include, but are not limited to, the pMB1 replicon Betlach et al., 1976, Fed. Proc.35 2037 , NR1 replicon Rownd and Mickel, 1971 Nature 234 40 , RK2 replicon Beringer, 1974, J. Gen. Microbiol.84 188 , RK6 replicon Kontomichalou et al., 1970, J.Bacteriol. 104 34 , pSC101 replicon Cohen and Chang, 1977, J. Bacteriol. 132 734 , RP1 replicon Grinsted et al., 1972, J. Bacteriol. 110 529 , RP4 replicon 1977,Nagahari et al., Gene 1 141 , RSF1010 replicon Guerry et al., 1974, J. Bacteriol. 117 619 , PUBII0 replicon Gryczan, et al., 1978, J. Bacteriol. 134 318 , and theSLPl.2 replicon Bibb et al., Nature 284 526 . It is understood and will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many additional prokaryotic replicons can be constructed and that generally some prokaryotic replicons are preferred and will be selected over others or use in certain hosts.For example, the RSF1010, PU3110, and the SLP1.2 replicons are respectIvely preferred for use in Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Streptomyces, while te other replicons cited above are preferred or use in E. coli. The vectors of the present invention are highly versatile and are functional in almost any prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. The only require ments are 1 that the host cell be capable of z division and culture 2 that the host cell be competent or transformation and 3 that the non transformed ost cell be sensitive to and thus killed by either or both hygromycin B and G418. Therefore, the present vectors are useful in bacteria, fungi, yeast, plant cells, animal cells, and free living unicellular eukaryotes. The wealth of genetic and biochemical in formation about E. coli Kl2 makes it a convenient and preferred prokaryotic host cell for purposes of the present invention. Other preferred prokaryotic host cells are bacteria, including but not limited to E.coli, E. coli K12 3E827, Bacillus, Bacillus subtilis,Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Streptomvces, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus , Actinomycetes, and Serratia and bluegreen algae. Preferred eukaryotic host cells are fungi, including but not limited to Neurospora, Cechalo sporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and yeast cells susceptible to culture that are derived from tissue of multicellular organisms, including but not limited to a mammalian cell, murine mammalian cell, mouse cell,Mouse Ltk cell, human ceil, avian cell, amphibian cell, reptilian cell, a cell derived from a member of the phylum Chordata, an animal cell, a plant cell, a gymnospermous cell, an angiospermous cell and free living unicellular organisms, including but not limited to algae and protozoans. As described above, the vectors of the present invention are functional in virtually any te of prokaryotic or eukaryotic nost cell and confer the desired antibiotic resistance to hygromycin 3 and G413 sensitive cells such as, for example, E. coli Kl1BES27, E. coli K12 3E783, E. coli K12 BE1041, MouseLtk cells, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Thus, the transformants of the present invention, including but not limited to illustrative transforamants E. coli K12BE827 pKC214, E. coli K12 BE27 pKC215, Mouse Ltk pKC214,Mouse Ltk pKC215, E. coli K12 BE783 pKC273, andSaccharomyces cerevisiae pKC273, express resistance to either or both of the aforementioned antibiotics and are therefore useful, under appropriate selectIon conditions, for propagating and maintaining the present vectors Those skilled in the art will further recognize that non selectable structural genes can be cloned into the vectors and that, following transformation and subsequent culturing under hygromycin B or G418 selection pressure in mammalian or other host cells, the clone genes can be stabilized, maintained, and expressed.Only host cells thus transformed can survive in the presence of hygromycin B or G418 so therefore, the vectors of the present invention allow for the easy isolation and initial identification of transformants. The large number of host cells tat can be transformed with the vectors of the present invention is important because it allows for the easy amplification and manipulation of eukaryotic vectors in prokaryotic host cells. This is particularly advan tageous because the genetic background of prokaryotes, such as E. coli and the like, is well known and conventional recombinant DNA procedures are applicable and can be conveniently done in such systems. Consequently, the present recombinant DNA cloning vectors, including those that contain selectable or non selectable structural genes, can be first manipulated and ampified in prokaryotic cells and then transformed into eukaryotic host cells for expression, thus avoiding the serious problems associated with being restricted exclusively to eukaryotic systems. While all the embodiments of the present invention are useful, some of the present recombinantDNA cloning vectors and transformants are preferred.Accordingly, preferred vectors are plasmids pKC2l4, pKC215, and pKC273 preferred prokaryotic transformants are E. coli K12 BE827 pKC2l4, E. coli K12 BE827 pKC215, and E. coli K12 BE783 pKC273 and preferred eukaryotic transformants are Mouse Ltk pKC214, Mouse Ltk pKC215, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae pKC273. The utility of the vectors and transformants of the present invention is broad and allows for the greater and more rapid application of recombinant DNA technology to eukaryotic systems. For example, the ability of the present vectors, including plasmids, bacteriophages, and viruses, to confer resistance to antibiotics that are toxic to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells provides a functional test for selecting transformants. This is important because such a test is a practical necessity for determining and selecting the particular cells that have acquired vector DNA. Additional DNA sequences, nat lacks tunctional tests for their presence, can ce inserted onto the present vectors and then transformants containing the non selectable DNA can be isolated cy hygromycin B or G418 selection. Such non selectableDNA sequences nclude, but are not limited c, genes that specify a post translationally modified protein such as, for example, fibronectin or hepatitis 3 antigen, both of which are post translationally glycosylated by eukaryotic cells. More particularly a non selectable gene sequence can be inserted, for example, into the PvuI site of plasmids, such as, for example, illustrative plasmids pGD14 and pGD15, that contain the 2.75kbSalI BglII restriction fragment of plasmid pKC203. Such an insertion inactivates the hygromycin 3 resistance gene and thus allows for the easy identification of transformants containing the recombinant plasmid.This is done by first selecting for G418 resistance and, secondarily, identifying those G418 resistant transformants that are not resistant to hygromycin B.In a similar manner, insertion of a gene sequence of interest at, for example, the XhoI site inactivates theG418 resistance gene. Thus transformants carrying this recombinant plasmid also can be identified easily by first selecting for hygromycin B resistance and, secondarily, identifying those hygromycin 3 trans formants that are not resistant to G418. Therefore, the ability to select for antibiotic resistance in eukaryotic or prokaryotic transformants allows for the efficient isolation of the extremely rare cells that contain the particular non selectable DNA of interest. The functional test for antibiotic resistance, as described herein above, can also be used to identify DNA sequences that act as control elements and direct expression or an individual antibiotic resistance gene.Such sequences, including but not limited to promoters, attenuators, repressors, induces, ribosomal binding sites, and the like, can be used to control the ex pression of other structural genes in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The hygromycin a and G418 resistance conherring vectors of the present invention are also useful for stabilizing linked DNA sequences of various sorts. These genes or fragments, covalently linked to the hygromycin B or G418 resistance gene and propagated either in eukaryotes or prokaryotes, can be maintained by exposing the transformants to levels of hygromycin B or G418 that are toxic to non transformed cells.Therefore, transformants that lose the vector, and consequently any covalently linked DNA, die and are eliminated from the culture. Thus, the vectors of the present invention can stabilize and maintain any DNA sequence of interest. The cloning vectors and transformants of the present invention not only provide for the commercially feasible production of both unmodified and posttranslationally modified polypeptides in eukaryotic cells, but also for improved yields of various products that are currently produced in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Examples of such products include, but are not limited to, Streptomycin, Tylosin, wephaiosporins, Actaplanin, biosynthetic insulin, biosynthetic human insulin, biosynthetic human insulin, biosynthetic interferon, and biosynthetic human interferon.The present invention also provides selectable vectors that can be used to identify, characterize, and reconstructDNA sequences that code for 1 commercially important proteins, 2 enzymatic functions in netabolic pathways leading to commercially important processes and ccm pounds, or 3 control elements that prove ene expression. These desired DNA sequences include, ou are not limited to, DNA that codes for the biodegradation of hydrocarbons, for derivatized antibiotics such asr for example, Cephalosporin, Tylosin, and Actaplanin derivatives , or for enzymes that mediate and increase bioproduction of antibiotics or other products.The capability for inserting and stabilizing such DNA sequences in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is important because the production, using recombinant DNA methodology, of certain antibiotics and post translationally modified proteins requires a eukaryotic host.Moreover, the ability of the present vectors to be functional in prokaryotic cells such as, for example,E. coli, allows for their easy manipulation and amplification, thus circumventing the problems associated with eukaryotic cells in which such procedures are difficult if not impossible to do The present invention further provides or the construction of new varieties or strains of multicellular organisms that can better tolerate a vigorous regimen of antibiotics designed to eliminate iternal parasites, pathogenic bacteria, and other infections agents.For example, the hygromycin B or G418 resis tance genes of the present invention can be inserted, individually or in combination, into germline or early embryonic cells to create multicellular organists that are highly resistant to the antibiotics. Therefore, resistant multicellular varieties such as, for example, swine, cattle, and sheep, can be made to better tolerate the higher levels of antibiotics that are required fr improved control of harmful parasites and infections disease causing agents tat slow growth and reduce vitality. The following examples further illustrate and detail the invention disclosed herein. Both an explana tion of and te actual procedures for constructing the invention are described where appropriate. Example 1 Plasmìd pKC203 A Isolation of. Plasmid DNA From F. coli JR225 The bacterium E. coli JR225 ATCC No. 31912 was cultured in TY broth 1 tryptone, 0.5 yeast extract, 0.5 sodium chloride, pH 7.4 with 100 g ml.of antibiotic hygromycin B according to conventional microbiological procedures. After 18 hours incubation, about 0.5 ml of the culture was transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and centrifuged for about 15 seconds. Unless otherwise indicated, all the manipulations were done at ambient temperature. The resultant supernatant was carefully removed wit a finetip aspirator and the cell pellet was suspended in about 100 l. of freshly prepared lysozyme solution which contained 2 mg. ml. lysozyme, 50mH glucose, 10 mHCDTA cyclohexane diaminetetracetate and 25 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 . After incubation at 0 C for 30 minutes about 200 l of alkaline SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate solution 0.2N NaOH, 1 SDS was added and the tube was gently vortexed and then maintained at oac. for 15 minutes. Next about ISO 1. of 3M sodium acetate prepared by dissolving 3 moles of sodium acetate in a minimum of water, adjusting the pH to 4.3 with glacial acetic acid, and then adjusting the volume to 1. was added and the contents of the tube were then mixed gently by inversion for a few seconds during which time a DNA clot formed. The tube was maintained at 0 C. for 60 minutes and then centrifuged for 5 minutes to yield an aLmost clear supernatant. About .4 ml of the supernatant was transferred to a second centrifuge tube to which 1 ml. of cold ethanol was added. After the tube was held at 20 C. for 30 minutes, the resultant precipitate was collected by centrifugation 2 minutes and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. The thus collected pellet was dissolved in 100 l of 0.1M sodium acetate 0.05M Tris HCl pH 8 and was repre cipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of cold ethanol. After 10 minutes at 200C., the precipitate e was col lected by centrifugation, as described above, and constitutes the desired F. coli JR225 plasmid DNA.B. Transformation of E. coli JR 225 Plasmid DNA and Isolation of Plasmid pKC203. The E. coli JR225 plasmid DNA pellet was dissolve in about 100 1. of 0.1 sodium acetate 0.05MTris ECl pH 8 and precipitated with 2 volumes of cold ethanol. The resultant plasmid DNA, was collected and then dissolved in about 40 l. of water or dilute buffer, and finally used to transform S. coli K12 3E327 in substantial accordance with the transformation method of Wensink, 1974, Cell 3 315. E. coli K12 BE327 has been deposited and made part of the stock culture collection of the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, from which it is available to the public without restriction under the number ATCC 31911.The resultant transformants were selected on TY agar 1 tryptone, 0.5 yeast extract, 0.5 sodium chloride, 1.58 agar, pH 7.4 containing 200 g ml of antibiotic hygromycin B. Some of the transformants, as shown by gel electrophoresis Rao and Rogers, 1978 and other tests, contained both large and smaller 15kb plasmids and were resistant to both antibiotics ampicillin and hygromycin B. Other transformants contained only the smaller 15kb plasmid and were resistant to antibiotics hygromycin B and G418 but were sensitive to ampicillin. Transformants of the latter te were plated on TY agar containing 1 mg. ml of antibiotic hygromycin B and were cultured using standard microbiological tech niques. The resultant cells were used, according to the procedure of Example 1A, to isolate the above described l5kb hygromycin 3 and G418 resistance con ferring plasmid, hereinafter designated as plasmid pKC203. The presence of te antibiotic hygromycin B and G418 resistance genes on plasmid pKC203 was confirmed by subsequent transformation and selection analysis. Example 2 Isolation of the Antibiotic Hygromycin B And G418 Resistance Genes and Control Elements About g. cf plasmid pKC203 DNA were treated with Bg1II restriction enzyme according to the instructions and under the conditions specified by the manufacturer . Of the 7.5kb, 5.8kb, and 0.Skb fragments recovered, the 7.5kb BglII fragment contained the desired antibiotic hygromycin B and G418 resistance genes and control elements. This was confirmed by subsequent transformation and selection analysis which showed that cells that are normally sensitive to antibiotics hygromycin B and G418 are resistant to the antibiotics upon transformation with the 7. Skb Bg1II fragment. Restriction enzymes and instructions can be readily obtained from the following sources Bethesda Research Laboratories Inc.

Cloning as described below, allows for the expression of the antibiotic hygromycin B and G418 resistance genes. About 5 ug. of plasmid pSV5 gpt DNA were treated with Bgllt restriction enzyme according to the instructions and under the conditions specified by the manufacturer. After the enzyme was inactivated by heating at 70 C. for 5 minutes, about 1 ug of the DNA was mixed in a 1 1 ratio with the 7.5 kb Bg1II fragment of pKC203.The fragments were joined using T4 DNA ligase according to the instructions and under the conditions specified by the manufacturer T4 DNA ligase and instructions can be readily obtained from the following source Bethesda Research Laboratories Box 60la Rockville, Maryland 20850 The ligated mixture was used to transform E. coli S12 BE827 in substantial accordance with the transformation method of Wensink, 1974, Cell 3 315, on TY plates containing 100 g. ml each of antibiotics ampicillin and apramycin.The recombinant clones were plated on my plates containing 100 g. ml. of ampicillin and 200 u,g. ml. of antibiotic hygromycin B. About half of the antibiotic hygromycin 3 resistant recombinant clones contained plasmid pK214 Figure 3 while the remainder contained plasmid pKC215 Figure 4 . Plasmid DNA from various of the above clones was isolated, according to the procedure of Example 1A, and conventionally distinguished by restriction enzyme analysis. In this way, the constructed plasmids pKC214 and pKC215 and the constructed transformants E. coli K12BE827 pKC214 and E. coli K12 BE87 pKC215 were identified and subsequently isolated for future use. Example 4Construction of Mouse Ltk pKC214 Mouse Ltk cells were conventionally cultured for regular cell maintenance in a medium comprising minimum essential medium with Earle s salts and nonessential amino acids Eagle, 1959, Science 130 432 , 10 v v newborn calf serum, and 292 g. ml. glutamine.The thus cultured Mouse Ltk cells were then transformed with plasmid pKC214 in substantial accordance with the protocol described in Wigler et al., 1979, rcc. Nat. cad. Sci. USA 76 3 1373, except that 1 100 300 ng. of plasmid DNA was added to each plate in 1 ml. of calcium phosphate precipitate and 2 the culture medium was as described above. After 4 hours incubation at 370C., the medium was replaced with fresh medium and the cells were allowed to incubate for an additional 20 hours. At that time antibiotic,hygro mycin B selection pressure was applied.This was done by changing the medium to a selection medium which contained the above described medium and also about 75 1000 g. ml. of antibiotic hygromycin B. The concentration of the antibiotic that is preferred for the selecting medium. is 200 vg. ml. The selecting medium was changed after the first day, then two days after that, and finally after every third day over the 2 3 weeks in which transformant clones arose. Colonies were harvested by hand using a pipette and were grown into mass culture under continued selection pressure.The thus cultured antibiotic hygromycin B resistant cells constitute the desired Mouse Ltk pKC214 transformants. Example 5 Construction of Mouse Ltk pKC215 Mouse Ltk pKC215 cells were cons0tructed in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 4, except that plasmid pKC215, rather tan plasmid pKC214, was used in the trans ormation procedure. The thus constructed Mouse Ltk pKC215 transformants were then grown into mass culture. Example 6 Resistance of Transformants to Antibiotics Hygromycin B and G418 The ability of plasmids pKC203, pKC214, and pKC215 to conifer resistance to antibiotics hygromycin 3 and G418 was determined by testing transformed and non transionmed F. coli and Mouse Ltk cells for growth on media with varying amounts of the antibiotics. The media and culture conditions for E. coli and Mouse Ltk cells are substantially as described respectively inExamples IA and 4.The results of the test are presented below in Tables 1 and 2 wherein indicates growth, indicates no growth, and N T indicates not tested.

Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 78 4 2199, contains a unique BamHI restriction site in the cytochrome c gene. Cloning the 7.5kb BglII fragment of plasmid pKC203 into this site, as described below, allows for the expression of the antibiotic hygromycin B resistance gene. The desired insertion is easily carried out since BglII fragments contain 5 extensions with the sequence GATC that are identical to 5 extensions of BamHI fragments. There fore Bg1II fragments and BamHI fragments are compatible and can be ligated directly ror the production of recombinants. Plasmids pGDl and pGD2 and transformants E.coli K12 BE827 pGD1 and E. coli K12 BE827 pGD2 are constructed in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 3, except that plasmid pLG669, with the unique BamHI site, is used instead of plasmid pSV5gpt.Depending upon the orientation of the BglII fragment, plasmids of two orientations result. Plasmid, pGD1 designates recombinant plasmids in which the SalI restriction site is closest to the ura gene. Plasmid pGD2 designates plasmids with the reverse orientation. Example 8Construction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae pGD1 Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is typically grown in 1 yeast extract 2 bacto peptone using conventional microbiological procedures well known in the art. The transformation of plasmid pGD1 into yeast is carried out in substantial accordance with the teaching of Hinnen et al., 1978, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 75 1929. Transformants are selected by adding lethal doses of antibiotic hygromycin B to the culture medium. Example 9Construction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae pGD2 The desired transformants are constructed in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 8, except that plasmid pGD2 is used instead of plasmid pGD1 Example 10Construction of Plasmids pGD3 and pGD4 and TransformantsE. coli K12 BE827 pGD3 and E. coli K12 BE827 pGD4 Plasmid p04, the construction of which is described in Solnick, 1981, Cell 24 135, contains the major Adenovirus 2 Ad2 late promoter at map coorainates 15.4 EcoRI to 16.5 HindIII . Cloning the 7.5kb BglIt fragment of plasmid pKC203 into the HindIII I site of plasmid p04 allows or the expression of the antibiotic hygromycin 3 resistance gene. The desired construction is conveniently done by adding, in substantial accordance with the teaching of Ullrich et al., 1977, Science 196 1313, HindIII linkers to the 7.5kb BgIII fragment and then ligating the thus modified fragment to HindIII treated plasmid p04 by use T4 DNA ligase. SindIII restriction and T4 DNA ligase enzyme are respectively available with instructions for use from the firms cited in Examples 2 and 3. After the 7.5kb BgIII fragment is provided with the HindIII linkers, the ligation of the fragment onto plasmid p04 to form plasmids pGD3 and pGD4 is carried out in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 3.The subsequent transformation into r, coli K12 BE827 to form E. coli K12 BE827 pGD3 and E. coli K12 BE827 pGD4 is also carried out according to the teaching of Example 3. As explained in Examples 3 and 7, plasmids of two orientations result depending upon the orientation of the inserted resistance conferring fragment.

DTT 100 mM Dithiothreitol , 5 l. 1000 mg. ml. BSA bovine serum albumin , 25 1. water, 5 l. 5 units BglII restriction enzyme, and 5 l. 10X reaction mix were incubated at 37 C. for about 1 hour. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 700C. for 5 minutes and then the reaction raix ture was cooled on ice, extracted with each of phenol and chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 , and then ethanol precipitated. The resultant BglII restriction fragments were dissolved in 5 trl. of 5mM NaCl and then ligated. Ligation was carried out by reacting 1 l. of the BglII restricted DNA with about 38 l. water, 5 1. 10mM ATP, 5 u1. ligation mix and 1 l. T4 DNA ligase v103 New England Bio Lab Units at 16 C. for about i6 hours. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 700C. for 5 minutes. After cooling on ice, the resultant ligated mixture is used to transform E. coliK12 BE827, in substantial accordance with the transformation procedure of Wensink, 1974, on TY plates containing 200 mg. ml. of antibiotic hygromycin B.Some of the transformants, as conventionally shown by gel electrophoresis Rao and Rogers, 1978 and other tests, contain only the desired 7.3 kb plasmid.Such a transformant, designated herein as E. coli K12BE827 pSC701, is selected, plated on TY agar containing 200 g. ml. of antibiotic hygromycin B, and then cultured using conventional microbiological techniques.The resultant cells are used to isolate plasmid pSC701 according to the procedure of Example 1A.

The resultant ligated mixture, which includes the desired hygromycin B resistance conferring 4.2kb plasmid pKC25,7 and also the hygromycin B, G418, and apramycin resistance conferring 5.0kb plasmid pKC259, was used to transform E. coli K12 BE783 deposited and made part of the permanent stock culture collection o the Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria, Illinois under the accession number B 15020 , in substantial accordance with the transformation procedure of Example 25. The desired transformants were selected, plated on TY agar containing 200 g. ml. of antibiotic hygromycin B, and then cultured separately using conventional microbiological techniques.Transformants containing pKC257 were easily and conventionally identi fied by screening for hygromycin B resistance and transformants containing plasmid pKC259 were identified by screening for apramycin and hygromycin B resistance. The transformants, designated herein as E. coli K12 BE783 pKC257 and E. coli K12 BE783 pKC259, were respectively used to isolate plasmids pKC257 and pKC259 according to the procedure of Example IA. The presence of the antibiotic resistance genes in the respective plasmids was further confirmed by subsequent transfor mation, selection, and restriction enzyme analysis.

The desired plasmid pKC261 is 3.2kb and confers resistance to hygromycin B The resultant ligated mixture is used to transform E. coli K12 BE783 in substantial accordance with the transformation procedure of Example 25. Transformants, designated herein as E. coli K12BE783 pKC261, are selected and used to isolate plasmid pKC261 according to the procedure of Example IA. The presence of the antibiotic hygromycin 3 resistance gene in plasmid pKC261 was further confirmed by subsequent transformation, selection, and DNA sequence anaiysis. A restriction site and functional map of plasmid pKC261 is shown in Figure 7 of the accompanying drawings.Reaction mix 10X for Sau 3AI restriction enzyme was prepared with the followmg ccposition. 500 awI NaCl 60 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 50 mM MgCl2 Example 28Construction of Plasmid pKC275 and Transformant E. ColiK12 BE1041 pKC275A. Partial HaeII Digestion of Plasmid pKC261 About 5 l. 5 l. of plasmid pKC261 isolated in Example 27 in TE buffer, 5 l DTT, 5 l. 1000 mg. ml. BSA, 25 1. water, 5 ul. 5 units HaeII restriction enzyme, and 5 1. 10X reaction mix were incubated at 370C. for about 1 hour. After the reaction was terminated by incubation at 7O0C. for 5 minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled on ice, extracted with each of phenol and chloroform isoamyl alcohol 24 1 , and then ethanol precipitated. The resultant HaeII restriction fragments were dissolved in 5 l. of 5mMNaCl.B. Isolation of 394 nt plac Fragment Containing Ha elI Termini About 5 l. 5 g. of plasmid pUR222 isolated from E. coli K12 BE1166 pUR222 in substantial accordance with the teaching of Example 1 in TE buffer was HaeII digested in substantial accordance with the teaching ofExample 28A except that the reaction mixture was incubated at 370C. for about 2 hours to insure that the digestion was complete and not partial. The resultantHaeII restriction fragments were dissolved in 5 l. of 5 mM NaCl. E. coli K12 BE1166 pUR222 is a strain deposited and made part of the permanent stock culture col lection, Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria,Illinois. It is available to the public as a preferred source and stock reservoir of plasmid pUR222 under the accession number B 15023.C. Ligation and Transformation About 4 p1. each of plasmid pKC261 and plasmid pUR222 HaeII restriction fragments respec tively prepared in Examples 28A and B , 31 p1. water, 5 l. 10mM ATP, 5 l. ligation mix, and 1 F11. T4 DNA ligase X105 New England Bio Lab Units were reacted at 160C. for about 16 hours. After the reaction was terminated by incubation at 700C. for 5 minutes, the resultant ligated mixture was cooled on ice.The DNA was then transformed into E. coli K12 BE1041 deposited and made part of the permanent stock culture collection of the Northern Regional Research Laboratory, Peoria,Illinois under the accession number B 15021 , in substantial accordance with the transformation procedure of Example 25. Transformants containing only the desired 3.6kb plasmid pKC275 were designated as E.coli K12 BE1041 pXC27z. Such a transformant was selected, plated, cultured, and used for subsequent plasmid isolations. Both the presence of the 394nt plac containing fragment and the detailed structure of plasmid pKC275 were conventionally determined by gel electrophoretic and restriction enzyme analysis. Because plasmid pKC261 has three HaeII restriction sites, a partial HaeII digestion results in a mixture of different HaeII fragments. Consequently, the above illustrative procedure results in the con struction of both plasmid pKC275 and also the various insertional isomers of plasmid pKC275. Recombinant plasmids of two orientations are also produced since the 394nt plac containing fragment can be ligated in either direction. Those skilled in the art will under stand that the variously oriented plasmid isomers and also the resultant transformants can be readily iso latex and identified by conventional means. A re striction site and functional map of plasmid pKC275 is presented in Figure 8 of the accompanying drawings. Example 29Construction of Plasmid pKC264 and Transformant E. Coli K12 BE783 pKC264A.
