## Description
IMPROVED METHOD OF PREPARING ESTERS OF ARYLOXYPHENOXY PROPANOIC ACID The present invention is directed to an improved method of preparing esters of aryloxyphenoxy propanoic acid. In particular, the present invention is directed to an improved method of preparing esters of pyridyloxyphenoxy propanoic acid. The aryloxyphenoxy propanoic acid esters produced by the present invention are useful as herbicides. Aryloxyphenoxy propanoic acid esters are generally prepared by reacting an appropriate aryloxyphenate with an appropriate halopropionate in an inert solvent at an elevated temperature in the presence of an alkaline material. An excess molar quantity of the halopropionate is usually employed because of side reactions which occur that consume a portion of that reactant. Because an excess of halopropionate is desired, an almost instantaneous addition of halopropionate to the aryloxyphenate is required. This is impractical upon scale up to commercial production so the aryloxyphenate must be added to the halopropionate.Since the aryloxyphenate must invariably be prepared from the reaction of an aryl halide with hydroquinone due to the lack of commercial availability of aryloxyphenates in large quantities, a second reaction vessel is required so that the aryloxyphenate may beadded to the halopropionate. U.S. Patent 4,046,553 teaches a method of preparing a 4 5 mono substituted or 3,5 di substituted pyridyl 2 oxy phenoxyi alkanecarboxylic acid esters by reacting a pyridyloxyphenol with a haloalkanecarboxylate in the presence of an alkaline material at a temperature of about 40 C 120 C. See Column 11, lines 25 47 Column 12, lines 35 57 and PreparationExamples 1 and 4. British Patent Specification 1,599,121 teaches a method of preparing a 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyloxy phenoxyialkane carboxylic acid esters by reacting a substituted pyridyloxyphenol with a haloalkanecarboxylate in the presence of an alkaline material at a temperature of 400C 2000C. See Page 7, line 30 to Page 8, line 6 Page 8, lines 25 to 36 and Preparation Examples 1 and 3. U.S. Patents 4,214,086 and 4,275,212 teach methods of preparing aryloxyphenols by reacting aryl halides with hydroquinone in the presence of a base such as NaOH or SOH. These reactions result in the formation of water. U.S. Patent 4,325,729 teaches a method of preparing pyridyloxyphenoxy propionates by reacting a pyridyloxyphenol with an a halogencarboxylic acid derivative in the presence of a base. Reaction temperatures are indicated between 0 C 200 C. The present methods known to prepare aryloxyphenoxy propanoic acid esters by reacting an aryloxyphenate with a halopropionate, including those described above, suffer from disadvantages, such as, side reactions resulting in the formation of undesirable by products and a rather low conversion 75 80 of the starting materials to the desired products A base, such as, sodium or potassium carbonate, is usually added to the reactants to increase the conversion to 99 but introduces a solid waste problem. Because of the occurrence of side reactions, an excess of halopropionate is normally employed which introduces purification steps and additional process steps for the recovery of the excess halopropionate. The present invention remedies the above problems encountered in the preparation of esters of aryloxyphenoxy propionic acid. It has been discovered that water is a major cause of side reactions and is responsible for the low conversion of the starting materials. The conversion is increased to about 95 and most side reactions are minimized when the aryloxyphenate and the appropriate propionate are reacted in the presence of less than 1,000 parts per million by weight ppm of water. It has also been discovered that elevated temperatures enhance the formation of a bis aryloxy benzene by product.The formation of this bis by product is reduced when the aryloxyphenate and propionate are reacted at a temperature below 350C. The combination of a low water level reaction and a low temperature reaction results in advantages, such as the elimination of the need for a base a higher yield based on the propionate starting material a one vessel reaction the elimination of the step to recover excess propionate since near stoichiometric amounts of the propionate are employed and a reduction in the side reactions by products caused by high temperature and high water levels. The present invention involves improvements in the method of preparing aryloxyphenoxy propionic acid esters by reacting an aryloxyphenate with a propionate. The improvements are a conducting the reaction in the presence of less than 1,000 parts per million by weight ppm water and, optionally b conducting the reaction at a temperature below 350C. Each improvement, separately, is responsible for less by product formation thereby resulting in an improved yield of the desired aryloxyphenoxy propionic acid ester. The improvements may be practiced separately but are preferably combined and practiced together in a single operation. Of particular interest in the practice of the present invention is an improved method of preparing an ester of 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propanoic acid, commonly known as haloxyfop 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propanoic acid or 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid, commonly known as fluazifop. Esters of particular interest include the methyl, n butyl, methoxypropyl and ethoxyethyl esters. In one improvement in carrying out the method of preparing the aryloxyphenoxy propionic acid esters, an appropriate aryloxyphenate reactant and an appropriate propionate reactant are contacted in the presence of an inert carrier medium, wherein the water level in the reaction mixture is limited to less than 1,000 ppm.An additional improvement in the present reaction is achieved when the reaction is conducted at a temperature below 350C. Preferably, both the low water 1,000 ppm and low temperature 350C reaction conditions are carried out together in the same reaction resulting in an improved yield of the desired product.LOW WATER CONDITION The low water reaction condition can be achieved by distilling off water present in the aryloxyphenate inert medium mixture before the propionate reactant is added. The water is distilled off until the water level in the reaction mixture is less than 1,000 ppm, advantageously less than 500 ppm, preferably less than 250 ppm and most preferably less than 125 ppm. Water may be introduced into the reaction mixture in a number of ways. The most common way water is introduced into the reaction mixture is from the preparation of the aryloxy phenate. The reaction of hydroquinone with a base, such as, NaOH, KOH or NH4OH, in an inert carrier, forms a hydroquinone dianion and water.This hydroquinone dianion is reacted with an arylhalide to form the aryloxyphenate starting material. Attempts to distill the water out of the hydroquinone dianion carrier reaction mixture after formation of the hydroquinone dianion but before the reaction with the arylhalide fail to get the water level below 2,000 ppm.It has been surprisingly found that the addition of an effective amount of methanol to the hydroquinone di anon carrier water reaction mixture will promote the distillation of the water from the reaction mixture.The methanol will distill first, followed by the water, second. Usually methanol is added to the reaction mixture in an amount by weight that is at least about equivalent to the amount of water by weight that will be in the reaction mixture after formation of the hydroquinone dianion. Preferably, the weight ratio of methanol water in the reaction mixture will be about 2 1. It has also been surprisingly found that distillation after the hydroquinone dianion is reacted with the aryl halide to form the aryloxyphenate removes water from the reaction mixture to levels of 1,000 ppm or less. If the distillation is carried out long enough, water levels of 125 ppm or less are achievable. Alternatively, low water levels are achieved by preparing the hydroquinone dianion by reacting hydroquinone with an alkali metal alkoxide, such as, for example NaOCH3, KOCH3, NaOCH2 CH2 2CH3, KOCH2 CH2 2CH3, KOC2H5 or NaOC2H5, in an inert medium such as, for example dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , whereby the hydroquinone dianion and the corresponding alcohol are formed. This procedure avoids the formation of water in the preparation of the hydroquinone dianion. The resulting alcohol is readily distilled off from the reaction mixture. The metal alkoxides employed in preparing the hydroquinone dianion are well known compounds and can be prepared employing well known techniques.Suitable metal alkoxides include, for example, alkali metal alkoxides, such as, NaOCH3, NaOCH2 CH2 2 CH3 and NaOC2H. NaOCH3 and HaOC2H5 are prepared by reacting sodium metal with anhydrous methanol, n butanol or ethanol to make a solution of the corresponding alkoxide in the corresponding alcohol. The metal alkoxide solution is reacted with hydroquinone under N2 in an inert medium DMSO to make the hydroquinone dianion.The alcohol is then distilled off and the hydroquinone dianion is reacted with an aryl halide to form the aryloxyphenate starting material whereby substantially no water is present in the reaction mixture.LOW TEMPERATURE CONDITION Because the present reaction is exothermic, the low temperature reaction condition can be achieved by 1 adding the propionate starting material slowly to the aryloxyphenate so that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 350C or 2 cooling the reaction mixture with an external cooling means so that the reaction mixture does not exceed 350C.Advantageously, the reaction mixture is maintained throughout the reaction at a temperature below 300C and preferably at or below 250C. Suitable for use as an inert carrier medium are polar aprotic solvents, such as, DMSO, methyl ethyl ketone MEK , acetonitrile, dimethylformamide DMF , dimethylacetamide, diethylacetamide, methyl isobutyl ketone, hexamethylphosphoric acid triamide, tetramethylurea, sulpholane and N methylpyrrolidinone. A preferred inert carrier medium is DMSO. The present improvements provide a reaction wherein less by product formation is observed but provides about a 95 conversion of the aryloxyphenate starting material. To drive the reaction to completion an effective amount of a hindered non nucleophilic phenol, which is converted in situ to the phenate form, is added to the reaction. An effective amount of a hindered phenol will drive the reaction to 99 conversion. A preferred hindered phenol is 2,6 di t butyl 4 methyl phenol BHT .Usually at least 0.05 moles of hindered non nucleophilic phenol per mole of aryloxyphenate is added to the present reaction, i.e., about 5 mole percent. When a metal or ammonium hydroxide or an alkoxide is reacted with hydroquinone to form the hydroquinone dianion, a slight excess hydroxide or alkoxide is advantageously employed. This slight excess of hydroxide or alkoxide converts the hindered non nucleophilic phenol in situ to the phenate form.A hindered non nucleophilic phenol can be added to the hydroxide or alkoxide and hydroquinone reactants in an amount that is about equivalent to the slight excess of hydroxide or alkoxide. For example, if 2.05 moles of NaOB are reacted with 1.0 mole of hydroquinone, then about 0.05 mole of hindered non nucleophilic phenol is added to the reactants which is thereafter reacted with the aryl halide to form the aryloxyphenate. Upon addition of the propionate, a 99 conversion of starting materials is achieved. Suitable aryloxyphenate reactants include quinolinyloxyphenates, phenyloxyphenates, pyridyloxyphenates, quinoxalinyloxyphenates, benzoxazoloxy phenates and benzothiazolyloxyphenates. Preferred reactants include 4 pyridyl 2 oxy phenates of the formulaEMI9.1 wherein X and Y each independently represents CF3, H, C1,F, Br or I. The aryloxyphenates described above are known compounds and can be prepared employing techniques well known in the art, such as, for example, by the reaction of an arylhalide with the dianion of hydroquinone. Suitable propionate reactants include compounds of the formulaEMI9.2 wherein B represents C1 or Br and R represents C1 C8 alkyl or C3 C6 alkoxyalkyl.These propionate reactants are for the most part known compounds and can be prepared employing techniques well known in the art. Preferred propionates are those compounds wherein R is n butyl, methyl, methoxypropyl C3H6OCH3 or ethoxyethyl C2H40C2H5 . The present reaction can be characterized by the following chemical equation EMI10.1 wherein Ar represents phenyl, pyridyl, quinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, benzoxazolyl or benzothiazolyl and B and R are as defined above. No attempt has been made to balance the above equation. A hindered non nucleophilic phenol, which is converted into the phenate form in situ, may be added to the reactants to drive the reaction to 99 conversion. In one embodiment of the present invention, 4 5 trifluoromethyl pyridinyl 2 oxy phenate is reacted with an appropriate propionate, employing the low water and low temperature conditions described herein, resulting in the formation of the corresponding ester of 2 4 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid. This reaction can be characterized as follows EMI10.2 wherein B and R are as hereinbefore defined. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridinyl 2 oxy phenate is reacted with an appropriate propionate, employing the low water and low temperature conditions described herein, resulting in the formation of the corresponding ester of 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid. This reaction can be characterized as follows EMI11.1 wherein B and R are as hereinbefore defined. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridinyl 2 oxy phenate is reacted with an appropriate propionate, employing the low water and low temperature conditions described herein, resulting in the formation of the corresponding ester of 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid This reaction can be characterized as follows EMI12.1 wherein B and R are as hereinbefore defined. Once prepared, the aryloxyphenoxy propionates formed by the present reaction are recovered employing standard, well known, extraction and purification techniques, such as, for example, solvent extraction with methylene chloride. The following examples illustrate the practice of the present invention. No attempt has been made to balance any chemical equations described herein. Water level determinations were made by the KARL FISHER method.Example 1 A 250 milliliter ml , 3 neck, round bottom flask, equipped with a thermowell, addition funnel, air driven stirrer and a 20 centimeter cm x 1 cm vigreaux column with distillation head, was purged with N2 and loaded with 100 ml of DMSO and 11 grams g O.r mole of hydroquinone. The addition funnel was loaded with 16 g of 50 NaOH 0.2 mole . The flask was heated to approximately 600C where the system was degassed by pulling a vacuum until the DMSO started boiling and then releasing the vacuum with N2. The system was degassed three 3 times in this manner and the vacuum was set at approximately 100 millimeters mm .The temperature was increased to approximately 950C and the NaOH was added over a 5 10 minute period causing the dianion of hydroquinone to precipitate. The temperature was increased to distill off the water at a pot temperature of approximately 1050 1250C and a head temperature of 500 1240C. When only DMSO was coming overhead about 25 g of distillate , the temperature was decreased to approximately 800C and the vacuum was released to N2. Keeping the temperature of the reaction mixture below 90 C, 21.6 g 0.1 mole of 2,3 dichloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine was added over a 10 20 minute period. The reaction mixture was kept at a temperature between 800 900C for 1 1 hours whereby 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridyl 2 oxy phenate was formed. At this point the reaction mixture contained from 2,000 5,000 ppm water.About 30 50 g of DMSO was distilled off from the reaction mixture at 800C 15 mm which reduced the water level from 5,000 ppm to less than 120 ppm. The reaction mixture was cooled to 250C and 13.5 g 0.11 mole of methyl 2 chloropropionate was added over a 15 minute period so that the temperature remained under 300C. After 5 hours at room temperature, the conversion of 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridyl 2 oxy phenate to 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid, methyl ester was 96 . The product mixture was filtered. The precipitate was washed with four 4 25 ml portions of methylene chloride. The combined filtrates were extracted with one 1 50 ml and three 3 20 ml portions of water. The water was made acidic with HC1 to break emulsions.The organic phase was solvent stripped on a rotavap at 700C 20 mm for 30 minutes to give 37 g of crude product assaying at approximately 91 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid, methyl ester.Example 2 Sodium metal was added to methanol to make a 20 by weight solution of NaOCH3 in methanol. 54 g 0.2 mole NaOCH3 of the NaOCH3 in methanol solution was placed in an N2 purged flask with 0.1 mole hydroquinone and 100 ml DMSO. Most of the alcohol was stripped out at atmospheric pressure until the pot temperature reached approximately 1300C. The pot was cooled to approximately 60 C and put under a 100 mm vacuum.The remaining alcohol was taken overhead until only DMSO was coming overhead. 21.6 g 0.1 mole of 2,3 dichloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine was added to the reaction mixture resulting in the formation of 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridyl 2 oxy phenate. At this point the water content of the reaction mixture was 100 250 ppm H2O.
