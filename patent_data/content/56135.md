# FLOWMETER SYSTEM WITH IMPROVED DYNAMIC RANGE

## Abstract
A flowmeter system having means defining a path for confining the flow of a fluid medium therethrough, first and second transducers disposed along said flow path for generating and receiving acoustic compression waves in the fluid medium between the transducers, a phase lock loop transmitter receiver system including a voltage controlled oscillator for adjusting the frequency of the acoustic compression waves to maintain the compression wave length constant, means for measuring the phase difference of the received acoustic compression waves relative to that transmitted and means for producing a sum signal proportional to the sum of the two measured phase differences to vary the output of said voltage controlled oscillator, and means for producing a difference signal proportional to the difference of the two measured phase differences which provides an output signal representing the direction and magnitude of the measured flow, said means for measuring the phase sum and difference comprising a phase detector of the edge triggered type comprising a set reset flipflop which is physically separated from the voltage controlled oscillator. The system also includes means for generating signals representing changes in velocity of sound in the fluid medium.
