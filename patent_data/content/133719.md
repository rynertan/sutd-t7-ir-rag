# Handling apparatus for suspended transfer of cargoes, i.e. in particular a crane for loading and unloading containers.

## Abstract
Cargo handling apparatus for transferring cargo, i.e. containers between cargo receiving areas i.e. a hold of a ship and a dockside. The apparatus includes a frame carried on mount means with a boom projecting outwardly. Two closed tracks 10,20 are carried from the frame. Cargo is transferred by combinations of two trolleys, 31,32,33,34 one in each track, and a grip. 40,41 With two trolleys 31,32 on the outward sides 22,11 of the tracks the grip 40 is in a position perpendicular to the boom. With two trolleys 33,34 on the inward sides 12,21 of the tracks, one following the other, the grip 41 is in a parallel position to the boom. In the last position the grip 41 can be moved through the opening formed by the suspension means 61,62 of a combination in the first position. Combinations turn and change position at the ends of the boom following in each others path.
