## Description
MULTILEVEL METAL STRUCTURE AND PROCESS FOR MAKING SAMEThe invention relates to a layered composite structure in an integrated circuit package having a substrate with a conductive interconnective first pattern on a surface thereof and a method of forming superposed levels of metallurgy in the fabrication of an integrated circuit package where said method starts from a substrate having a conductive interconnected pattern on a surface thereof.Fabrication of large scale integrated circuits with dense networks of multilevel metal interconnections requires design development of improved materials processes in terms of compatability of contiguous films in multilevel structures and reduced sensitivity to process tolerances. Also, in order to maintain processing groundrules and insure good coverage of metal and insulators at all levels, processes for planar surface topography are essential.In U. S. Patent 3,985,597, a planar process for forming embedded interconnection metallurgy is described according to which a substrate is overcoated with a first layer of an organic thermosetting resin followed by a second polymeric layer removable by a solvent system without affecting the first layer, subsequent third layer resistant to reactive ion etching in oxygen and finally a top layer of a resist material with sensitivity to e beam, x ray, UV or optical radiation.A desired metallurgy pattern in the resist layer is defined by the usual lithographic process followed by reactive ion etching RIE to transfer the pattern into the third, the second and the first layer, blanket deposition of a conductive metal layer having a thick ness approximately matching the thickness of the first layer, and finally a solvent soak to lift off the non imaged composite structure selectively at the interphase of the first and second layer.In U. S. Patent 4,367,119, an improved planar multilevel process using inorganic films such as silicon nitride, or silicon oxide as dual dielectric and built in etch stop is described for interconnection metallurgy system embedded in polyimide passivating layer with planar top surface.According to the polvimide planar process of the aforesaid U. S. Patent, for the first level metallization, a polyimide film is first spin applied on a substrate and is cured up to 4000C. This is followed sequentially by a plasma enhanced chemically vapor deposited layer of silicon nitride as the etch stop, a polysulfone lift off layer applied by spin coating and subsequently cured up to 3000C, SiO or glass resin as a barrier x layer and finally the resist layer.The via pattern is formed by the conventional lithographic technique followed by RIE in a CF4 ambient to etch the SiOx layer, in 03.to etch the polysulfone layer, again inCF4 to etch the silicon nitride layer and finally in 2 to etch the polyimide layer followed by in situ sputter cleaning step, metal evaporation for the desired metallurgy, and lift off by soaking in n methylpyrrolidone NMP at 600 to 850C. The process is then repeated for increasing levels of metallization.Although this strategy has several advantages, e.g., overcoming the non planarity problem that is generally encountered in the conventional lift off methods, reduction of interlevel shorts and maintenance of desired insulator thickness between levels of metal lization it has the disadvantage of incompatibility of the organic inorganic composite layers with consequent vulnerability of the structure to processinduced stresses causing product reliability concerns or failure of the process to provide defect crack free structures.For example, with polysulfone resin as the 11lift off layer and silicon nitride as 0 etch stop according to the process described in the above patent, it is observed that during the lift off step which requires protracted soak in NMP at 850C, the underlying polyimide layer swells due to solvent permeation invariably causing stress cracking of the overlying silicon nitride layer which is rigid and non compliant.It is the object of the invention to provide planar, crack free multilevel metal structures embedded in passivating layers without interlevel shorts and a method for forming such structures that is relatively insensitive to process tolerances.This object is achieved by a layered composite structure in an integrated circuit package having a substrate with a conductive interconnective first pattern on a surface thereof, said structure comprising a first layer of an organic polymer electrical insulator overlying said surface and said first pattern and a covering organometallic insulating layer overlying said polymer layer and a second conductive pattern on said organo metallic insulating layer and there being at least one via opening through said composite layered structure to a portion of said first pattern and conductive metallurgy in said via opening interconnecting the said first pattern and said second pattern, and by a method of forming superposed levels of metallurgy in the fabrication of an integrated circuit package when said method starts from a substrate having a conductive interconnected pattern on a surface thereof and comprises the following steps in the following sequence Af forming a first layer of an electrically in sulating polymer on said surfaceB coating said first layer with a second layer of a plasma deposited organometallic insulat ing material divinyl tetramethyl disiloxane, hexamethyl disilazane, hexamethyl disiloxane, divinyl tetramethyl disilazane, trivinyl penta methyl trisiloxane or vinyl trimethoxysilaneC coating said second layer with a third layer of a polymer that is selectively soluble in solvent to which the first said polymer is inertD coating said third layer with a fourth layer resistant to reactive ion etching in oxygen ambient E forming on said fourth layer a resist mask defining at least one via opening to a portion of said con ductive patternF reactive ion etching in CF4 ambient the exposed portion of said fourth layer in said via openingG reactive ion etching in an oxygen ambient portions of said third layer in said via openingH reactive ion etching in a CF4 or CHF3 or mixture of CF4 and 2 ambient the exposed portions of said second layer in said via openingI reactive ion etching in O2 ambient the exposed portion of said first layer in said via opening to expose said portion of said conductive patternJ blanket coating said substrate inclusive of said via opening with a conductive metal layer having thickness close to the said first layerK exposing said substrate to said solvent for a time sufficient to remove said third layer and all overlying layers thereon, to expose plasma deposited organometallic insulating layer and said metal via connection in said via openingL sequentially coating said plasma deposited organo silicon layer with fifth, sixth and seventh layer corresponding respectively to the composition of said first, third and fourth layerM forming a second resist mask having openings corresponding to desired metallurgy patterns to be deposited on said plasma deposited organo silicon second layer, said opening encompassing said via connector and adjacent discrete areas of said plasma deposited second organosilicon layer N reactive ion etching in an ambient of CF4 the exposed portions of said seventh layer in the openings of said second resist mask 0 sequentially reactive ion etching in 02 ambient said sixth layer and said fifth layer in opening of said second resist mask, to expose said via connector and adjacent portions of said plasma deposited organosilicon second layer P depositing a blanket coating of a conductive metal over said substrate inclusive of said via connector and said adjacent exposed portion of said plasma deposited organosilicon layer Q exposing said substrate to a solvent selective to the said sixth layer for a time sufficient to remove said sixth layer including overlying layers thereon. The inventive structure is relatively insensitive to process induced stresses, provides more compatible composite structures for multilevel metal processes and also films, that are resistant to reactive ion etching in an oxygen containing atmosphere and are not affected by ambient humidity and shelf time. The inventive method provides an improved strategy for the formation of metal interconnections in the fabrica tion of integrated circuits. The inventive method uses a compliant, solvent resistant but solvent permeable oxygen etch mask in a composite film structure which, unlike inorganic films such as silicon nitride or silicon oxide, does not undergo stress cracking in polar solvents such as NMP, DMF or diglyme. By applying thin barrier films which have lower pinhole density and enhanced solvent permeability than silicon nitride or silicon oxide an efficient escape of any residual volatiles during metal evaporation and an efficient removal of trapped solvents prior to high temperature process steps are guaranteed thereby eliminating conical stud formation or eliminating corrosion or darkening of metallurgy respectively.The application of the electrically non conducting oxygen RIE resistant films in processes for forming multilevel metals has the further advantages, that these films are compatible with organic and inorganic substrates and are formed from relatively non hazardous organosilicon monomers as opposed to potentially explosive SiH4 and Ski26 required for conventional barrier films such as silicon nitride or silicon oxide.Essentially for the inventive method for building planar multilevel metal insulator system is the usage of plasma polymerized organosilicon films as dual dielectric plus oxygen etch stop as replacement of conventional silicon nitride or silicon oxide. The methodology according to this invention provides crack free metallized structures while having the advantages of inorganic barriers which provide protection against overetching, reduce interlevel shorts and maintain requisite insulator thickness between metallization levels.For the overall process sequence to define various levels of metallization, a reference is made to the planar polyimide process with built in etch stop as described in U. S. Patent No. 4,367,119, which employs a thin plasma enhanced chemically vapor deposited silicon nitride as O2 etch stop and dual dielectric.The method of the present invention comprises depositing on a substrate which can be silicon, glass, ceramic, silicon silicon oxide a thermosetting resin such as polyimide planar layer, preferably by applying two coats to obtain the desired thickness. This is done by application of the first coat which is then prebaked at 10000 for 30 minutes and then at l500C for 15 minutes followed by the deposition of the second coat which is subjected to the prebake conditions of the first layer and then cured at 2000C for 15 minutes, 3000C for 15 minutes and finally to 40000 for 1 hour.This technique of polyimide application in two coats, with the first only partially cured, provides superior planarization and adhesion between polyimide layers.Over the fully cured polyimide layer is deposited a thin film 50 200 nm of plasma polymerized or plasma enhanced chemically vapor deposited organosilicon monomer such .as divinyltetramethyl disiloxane DVS , hexamethyldisiloxane HMS , hexamethyldisilazane HMDS or vinyl trimethoxysilane VTMS or trivinyl pentamethyl trisiloxane TVTS . The deposition of these barrier films can be carried out at ambient temperature when the films are subsequently annealed up to 250 400 C for 15 minutes to provide pinhole free, solvent resistant and thermally stable coatings. Deposition can also be carried out at elevated temperature preferably at 1000C 2500C using inductively coupled or capacitivelv coupled plasma systems. A polysulfone lift off layer is then spin applied over the barrier layer, prebaked at 1000C for 10 minutes, 2000C for 15 minutes and 3000C for 30 minutes, and overcoated with a second barrier layer consisting of coventional materials such as SiOx, glass resin or the plasma deposited organosilicons of the present invention, and finally a resist layer is applied by spin coating. After the necessary prebake of the resist coating, a desired metallurgy pattern is defined by the conventional lithographic process with e beam, x ray,UV or optical exposure. Typically, 1.5 2 micrometer film of a diazoquinone type resist such as AZ 1350J resist from Shipley Co. in Massachusetts is employed for this purpose.Reactive ion etching, a in a CF4 ambient is employed to transfer the exposed pattern into the SiOx or equivalent barrier film, b in 2 ambient to etch through the polysulfone layer, c inCF4 or a mixture of CF4 and 02, or in CHF3 to etch through the organosilicon barrier film and finally d in O2 to etch the polyimide layer followed by an insitu sputter clean step and blanket metal evaporation. The release of the lift off mask is accomplished by the usual process involving 2 8 hours soak in n methyl pyrrolidone NMP at 60 850C to provide crack free metallized via structure with the plasma deposited organosilicon film remaining firmly adhered to the underlying polyimide layer. Prior to defining second metal level, the post lift off structure is heated at 850C for 5 minutes, 2000C for 10 minutes and at 3000C for 10 minutes under nitrogen to insure removal of any trapped NMP. The process employed to construct further levels of metallization is similar to that described for the stud level, using plasma deposited organosilicon films as substitutes for silicon nitride and or silicon oxide in the desired composite layer structure. Although the use of plasma deposited divinyl tetramethyl disiloxane, hexamethyldisiloxane, hexamethyldisilazane or vinyl trimethoxysilane is given here for etch stop or masking layer, other plasma deposited organosilicons described in the European patent application 114 229 can also be used for this invention.In summary, the process relates to the construction of a planar multilevel metal insulator structure with a built in etch stop layer of plasma deposited organosilicons. This etch stop layer also serves as a dual dielectric between metal levels and reduces interlevel shorts. The technique of applying polyimide in two coats with deposition of the second coat on semicured first coat and subsequent full cure at 4000C provides planar structures. The overall process materials of this invention is compatible with conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques.Other advantageous embodiments of the inventive structure and the inventive method are disclosed in the subclaims.The invention becomes more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings 1 through 13 illustrating the steps in the process for forming metallurgical patterns on a substrate and the product formed thereby.Background information relevant to this invention is described in U. S. Patent 3,589,710 and U. S. Patent 4,367,119, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by this reference as if they were reproduced in their entirety. While being broadly useful in a variety of applications including protective coatings for passivation and encapsulation, anti reflection coatings in conventional optics, thin light wave guides and moisture barrier films for alkali halide optics, the plasma deposited organosilicon films are employed according to the present invention as oxygen reactive ion etch RIE resistant coatings with organic or inorganic contacting layers in multilevel metal processes for high density integrated circuits.The preferred coatings of this invention have 1 high silicon to carbon ratio, 2 thermal stability up to above 4000C, 3 resistance to commonly employed processing solvents such as diglyme,NMP, chlorobenzene, cyclohexanone, etc., 4 resistance to reactive ion etching in 2 ambient, 5 etchable by reactive ion etch in CF4 or CHF3 ambient or buffered HF at rates comparable to the conventional barriers such as silicon nitride or silicon oxide, 6 organosilicon monomers with boiling points and vapor pressure in a convenient enough range to allow vaporization and provide high deposition rates using inductively or capacitively coupled plasma systems, 7 the organosilicon monomers with lowest possible toxicity or other safety related factors, and 8 desired functional characteristics of the films including mechanical electrical properties, adhesion to contiguous organic, inorganic or metallic layers and compatability in terms of thermal expansion coefficients with contacting polymer layers.The following sequence of steps describes the process materials of the present invention for forming a multilevel metal interconnection metallurgy system embedded in a passivating layer. FIG. 1 shows a substrate 1 which is typically a semiconductor nonocrystalline silicon or a ceramic substrate with metal lines with an overlying layer 2 of a dielectric as for example SiO2, Si3N4, SiOx, Ta2O5.The substrate 1 of the invention is an integrated circuit device having active and passive devices fabricated therein not shown which are suitably isolated from each other. The dielectric layer 2 is provided with appropriate contact openings not shown here for making electrical contact with devices underneath. For application to packaging, the substrate could also be glass or ceramic with metallurgy for supporting integrated circuit devices and appropriate associated circuitry.As shown in FIG. 2, a layer 3 of an insulator organic resin is deposited over layer 2. The material of layer 3, which can have thickness of 1 5 microns, can be any suitable dielectric that will have good adhesion to 2.An adhesion promoter such as t aminopropyltriethoxy silane A 1100 is applied by vapor deposition or spray or spin coating of a dilute 0.1 solution from ethanol, methanol or water. The preferred material for layer 3 is a polyimide derived from pyromellitic dianhydride and oxydianiline manufactured by duPont and sold under the trade name Pyralin RC 5878 . The resin is used as a polyamic acid solution which is applied in two or three coats depending upon the thickness required. Before final cure at 4000C for 30 min.to one hour, the initial coats are only cured at 1000C 10 min. and 2000C 10 min. each. This technique of using partially cured undercoats provides superior adhesion, better step coverage and higher planarity and is preferred over a single coat. Thickness of the coatings is controlled by selecting suitable viscosity of the polymer solution.A layer 4 consists of an organic polymer as a polsulfone, polycarbonate or a polyimide which is thermally stable to 3000C but is soluble in solvents which do not dissolve the underlayer 3 of duPont polyimide RC 5878 which is retained in the final structure as an interlevel dielectric. Also, the material of layer 4 should be relatively insensitive to any stray or backscattered electrons. Typical materials for layer 4 are Ciba Geigy polyimide UX218 duPont polyimide and ICI polysulfone 100 P. The use of this polysulfone is described inU. S. Patent 4,367,119. The thickness of this layer 4 is typically in the range of 0.3 to 2.5 microns more preferably 0.3 to 1 micron for integrated circuit applications and 1 2.5 microns for packaging.Layer 5 can be of any suitable material resistant to oxygen reactive in etching. Preferred meaterial used for layer 5 is SiOx deposited by evaporation or by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition CVD . However, inorganic materials SiO2, A12O3, Si, SiXNyHz and organometallics such as resin glass or plasma depositied organosilicons covered in the copending application can also be used. A layer 6 of a photoresist is then deposited on 5, exposed and developed according to well established technology. As shown in FIG. 3, via holes are then formed by removing the exposed portions of layers 5, 4 and 3 giving vertical walls with 4 and 3 undercut from layer 5 FIG. C . The preferred method for removing the patterned portion of the three layers is reactive ion etching. Preferred apparatus for this is given in U. S. Patent 3,589,710. For removing SiOx and the two organic under layers, the methodology is described in U. S. Patent 4,367,119.As indicated in FIG. 4, a metallic layer 7 is then deposited by evaporation on the top surface of 5 which also results in deposition of 2 through the openings.The thickness of 7 is approximately equal to that of 3. The conductive metal of layer 7 can be aluminum, aluminum copper alloys, tantalum, molybdenum or laminated combination such as chromium copper chromium, chromium silver chromium, Al Ti Si and the like.As shown in FIG. 5, film 4 and all the layers above 11 are next removed by exposing the substrate to a solvent in which the material of layer 4 is soluble.In the case of ICI polysulfone 100 P, the preferred solvent is NMP at 60 850C. Ultrasonic agitation facilitates the lift off. Essentially planar metal patterns surrounded by 3 are obtained by this technique. The small gaps or spaces 8 are filled with the polyimide used for 3 or any other suitable resin plastic when the second sequence of steps is used to form the next level of metallurgy. Again, it is preferred to apply the duPont polyimide RC 5878 layer in two coats to achieve gap filling and higher planarization.The most important departure from the previous art is the use of plasma polymerized organosilicon layer about 70 200 nm over thermosetting resin layer 3 .The preferred material of 3 is duPont polyimideRC 5878 used as interlevel dielectric shown in FIG. 6.It is understood that while polyimide RC 5878 is the preferred material, other thermally stable polymers could also be used. The preferred material for the organosilicon layer 9 is the plasma polymerized divinyltetramethyl disiloxane DVS or hexamethyl disilazane HMDS . These monomers are commercially available. Other organosilicons covered in the copending application can also be used for this layer. The monomers can be deposited in an inductively or a capacitively coupled plasma apparatus. Using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD tool equipped with heating capability, films are typically deposited at 100 1500C at 25 500 watts RF power at 50 KHz depending on the gas flow and the reactor configuration. The deposited films are preferably annealed at 250 4000C for 10 30 minutes under nitrogen. Annealing improves mechanical integrity of the films and adhesion with the polyimide underlayer 3 .In an inductively coupled apparatus operating at 13.56 MHz, the films deposited at room temperature and then annealed at 250 4000C as above perform equally well. The plasma deposition can be carried out in the presence of a carrier gas such as helium or argon which yields films with higher density.Thickness of the plasma deposited film generally is 100 250 nm. In a typical conventional PECVD reactor supplied by Applied Materials, Inc. with 20 diameter parallel plate set up, the following set of conditions give usable films of divinyltetramethyl disiloxane DVS or hexamethyldisilazane HMDS . HMDS 200 SCCM Argon 800 SCCM RF 50 KHz Power 100 watts or 0.28 watt Cm Substrate temperature 1000C Total flow 1000 SCCM Total pressure 33,33 bar 25 microns Deposition Rate 17.5 nm per minute. In another system operated at 13.56 MHz using 16 diameter parallel plate using a gas pressure of 33,33 46,66 bar 25 35 microns , divinyltetramethyl disiloxane DVS gives excellent films deposited at 22.5 nm minute. The films were annealed at 250 4000C for 10 minutes before applying the polysulfone layer 6 .In equipment run in inductive mode the samples are placed downstream in a chamber close to the end of the glow discharge tube and the samples are gently rotated 6 revolutions min. . DVS could be deposited at a rate of 6 7 nm using 5 15 watts power. For HMDS higher power 15 25 watts is required to give a deposition rate of 5 6 nm per minute. The films are preferably annealed at 250 4000C 10 15 min. before coating the next layer 4 .The layers 4 , 5 , in FIG. 6 correspond respectively to layers 4 and 5 in FIG. 2. A layer of photoresist 6 is then deposited on 5 and patterned suitably to furnish the via hole pattern 10 FIG. 7 after sequentially developing the resist layer 6 , reactive ion etching of 5 with CF, ambient, 4 with O2 ambient, 9 again with CF4 or a mixture of 2 CF4 in the ratio of 5 95 and finally with 2 again to make contact with the metal 7a. At this stage it is advisable to institute a sputter clean step using argon ions for 20 30 seconds or buffered HF cleaning for 5 10 seconds in order to remove any residue left on the metallurgy 7a.Metal is then blanket deposited leading to the formation of the studs 7b in contact with metallurgy 7a to give the structure represented by FIG 8. It must be noted here if an inorganic oxygen RIE barrier Si3N4 as described in U. S. Patent 4,367,119 is used in place of plasma deposited organosilicon layer 9 there is a higher tendency towards conical stud formation instead of the desired planar ones 7b 7b shown in FIG. 8. The organometallic film 9 used here being more permeable to gases alleviates the conical stud formation as gases or vapors now can escape throughout 9 at a higher rate during metal evaporation at 250 3000C than being forced to escape mostly through the via holes when Si N is used.It is also to be noted here that the organosilicon film 9 serves as O2 RIE stop which precludes any overetching of the underlayer 3 of the polyimide. Further, since the material of 9 has good insulation properties, the metallurgy 7a 7b remains embedded in the dual insulation layers 3 and 9 as shown FIG. 9 after lift off as before.The sequence of process steps given above can be repeated to deposit the insoluble polyimide e.g. duPont polyimide RC 5878 layer 3 , the solvent soluble lift off layer 4 e.g. ICI polysulfone, Ciba Geigy polyimide XU218 and the oxygen etch resistant mask layer 5 e.g. SiOx and an overlying resist layer 6 which is suitably patterned with openings 10 by optical, e beam, x ray, ion beam or deep W lithographic techniques FIG. 10 .After RIE of 5 SiOx in a CF4 ambient, sequential RIE in oxygen ambient is accomplished of the soluble layer 4 of polysulfone and the insoluble polyimide layer 3 .As shown in FIG. 11 the oxygen RIE is stopped at the etch stop dielectric layer 9 which protects the structure from any over etching or thinning of the insoluble polyimide underlayer 3 . The organosilicon layer 9 serves as an etch stop during RIE at the metal levels for interconnection of multilevel metallization. This enhances process tolerance for the RIE and permits rigorous removal of the oxygen etchable material from the patterned area 10 with built in safety against overetching or thinning of interlevel dielectric layer 31 and thereby prevents interlevel shorts. As shown inFIG. 11, after forming the patterned openings on the second level of conducting metal e.g. Al or Cu layer 7 is blanket deposited inclusive of the patterned openings e.g. by e beam evaporation shown in FIG. 12.This is followed by a lift off through dissolution of the soluble layer 4 which carries away with it the overlying layers 5 and portions of 7 contacting it. This results in the formation of a second level of metallization with the addition of pattern 7c FIG. 13 interconnected through stud 7b to the first level metal 7a. It should be noted here the above sequence of steps coupled with the choice of specific materials and process conditions results in a structure FIG. 13 with two levels of interconnected metallurgy without danger of interlevel shorts due to the interposition of the two dielectric layers viz polyimide 3 and plasma deposited organosilicon layer 9. The latter also serves as an etch stop which reduces interlevel defects by preventing thinning or overetching of the polyimide insulator 3 1 It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the above steps can be repeated over and over again to form a number of levels of metallurgy with interconnections as desired.
