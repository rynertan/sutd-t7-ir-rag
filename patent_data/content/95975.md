## Description
CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS OF 1.4 DIALKYL ARYLAMINO ANTHRAQUINONE DYESTUFFS FOR THE COLOURING OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS The present invention refers to concentrated solutions of 1.4dialkyl arylamino anthraquinone dyestuffs herein after called dyes suitable for the coloring of netroleum products and industrial organic solvents The colouring of the industrial organic solvents and of the petroleum products such as, for instance gasoline,kerosene, gas oil, is carried out in order to render them identifiable, and thus make difficult the possible taxevasions, which can result from utilizing said products for purpose that differ from the ones for which they are taxed.The colouring material, in order that it may be used in the colouring of fuels, must satisfy various requirements, i.e. among other 1 possess a high dyeing power 2 have a sufficient solubility in the solvents and in the fuels whether or not antiknock agents have been added 3 have a high diffusion index 4 contain little or no by product insoluble in fuels 5 leave only a minimum deposit of sludge in the engines 6 have a proper fastness to light during storage 7 be compatible with additives and not cause difficulties during combustion 8 be brittle but not powderous in the solid form 9 be sufficiently fluid to be solubilized in organic solvents, if it is used in the form of a concentrated solution. The use in the form of concentrated solution allows considerable advantages with respect to powdery products a easiness of use, b rapidity of dosage c high diffusion coefficient d absence of powders. All these characteristics, although necessary, are, however not sufficient for the choice of the suitable dye, since the dye must primarily be extractable with difficulty from the system in which it is dissolved. Anthraquinonic dyes, employable for the colouring of the petroleum products are known from the literature, such as, for instance, U.S. patent 2,211,943 U.S. patent 2,925,333 U.S. patent 3,164,499, however, they hardly succeed in satisfying the above listed requisites and in particular present on the one hand a limited solubility in the organic solvent and the other hand non extractability characteristics, that are inadequate in many cases. The anthraquinonic dyes for fuels having the following structures, are particularly known in the art EMI2.1 re R H, CH2 Solvent Blue 76, SolventGreen 3 C.I. 61565 However, the solubility of these dyes in the various solvents is very limited, chiefly with regard to the obtention of concentrated solutions, which should also be sufficiently stable at low temperatures therefore such dyes only find use as powders. Furthermore, they are easily extractable from the system. Now it has been found that it is possible to colour permanently petroleum products and industrial organic solvents, over coming the above drawbacks that are shown be the known anthraquinonic dyes, by using concentrated solution of anthraquinonic dyes comprising, in particular, alkyl arylamino groups. Therefore, the present invention concerns concentrated colouring solutions of blue green tone for petroleum products and organic solvents, consisting of a diluent organic phase and of from 30 to 50 by weight of an anthraquinonic compound or of a mixture of anthraquinonic compounds having the general formula EMI3.1 where in R1 and R2, equal to or different from each other, represent alkyl ra dicals having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms. The diluent organic phase consists of one or more organic solvents such as, for instance, alpha chloronaphthalene, alpha and beta methylnaphthalene, alpha bromonaphthalene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, xylene, toluene, nitrobenzene, para nonylphenol and aliphatic alcohols. In fact, it has been found that the anthraquinonic dyes of general formula ii, according to the invention, besides answering theyanous requisites that dyes for fuels must meet, present unexpected characteristics of high solubility in the above cited organic solvents, so that it is possible to employ said dyes in the form of concentrated solutions, which are also sufficiently stable at low temperatures. Furthermore, it has been found that the dyes of formula II, according to the invention, present surprising characteristics of difficult extractability from the fuels and in particular they appear remarkably less extractable than homologous known dyes of formula I. In practice, solutions in fuels of the dyes of the invention of formula II, have shown, when treated with quantities of silica gel ranging from 120 to 25 gr. per litre fuel, an extractability of 16 to 50 lower than that, showed by analogous solutions in fuels of the dyes of formula I.The concentrated solutions of dyes, according to the invention, are prepared by reacting quinizarin of leucoquinizarin or mixtures thereof and one or more para alkylanilines in the presence of or after subsequent addition of the above mentioned organic solvents. The use of a mixture of para alkylanilines in the synthesis of the dyes allows the formation of a mixture of dyes of formula II, comprising both symmetrical derivatives R1 equal to R2 and asymmetrical derivatives R1 different from R2 . The dye mixture thus obtained shows a higher solubility in the organic solvents, with respect to the dye obtained from a single para alkylaniline. The synergic solubilizing effect of the dye mixture is such hat said mixtures appear in an oily or semioily form. which allows to obtain dye solutions having a high concentration in the above mentioned organic solvents. Concentrated dye solutions, ready to use and particularly advantageous are prepared by condensing the hydroxyanthraquinones with the mixture of chosen para alkylanilines, ending with the oxidation in situ of the still present leucoderivatives by means of nitrobenzene or of organic compounds of similar characteristics and with the dilution of the reaction bulk with one or more organic solvents, followed by an aqueous extraction of the present inorganic salts and a final anydrification.A further advantage of the dyes of the invention, with respect to the known dyes of formula I, resides in the lower toxicity of the paraalkylanilines having an aliphatic chain with a high number of atom carbon 8 to 20 , used in the synthesis of said dyes of formula II, with respect to the aniline or the para toluidine used in the sunthesis of the dyes of formula I The following examples are given to better illustrate the invention, without limiting, however, its scope.
