# TORQUE SENSING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A rotary shaft 13 is fitted with strain gauges 17 in a bridge formation arranged to give a response to torque. Wind ings 18a, 19a surround the shaft at axially spaced zones and rotate with it, co operating with fixed windings 18b, 19b pro viding transformer coupling. AC is applied across the bridge via one transformer 18 and an output from the bridge is available from the other transformer 19 . This output has a phase shift related to torque, and a phase shift detector 24 and filter 25 provide a torque indicative DC signal. The strain gauges 17 are mounted on a compliant bridge 15, 16 anchored at axially spaced zones to the relatively stiff shaft 13 for greater re sponse.
