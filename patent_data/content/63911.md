# FLOW LINE FOR USE IN THE TRANSFER OF FLUID TO OR FROM UNDER WATER SITES

## Abstract
A flow line system for use in the transfer of fluid to or from an under water site comprises a first flow line arrangement 7 installed so as to extend from the water bed to near, but below, the surface, this arrangement 7 being carried by a buoyant support column that is connected to the water bed at an articu lated connection 5 and that consists of rigid sections 6 that are connected in series at articulated connections 5A so that the first flow line arrangement 7 is rigidly supported by each section 6 but can articulate at the base of the column and at the connections 5A between the rigid sections 6 and a second, flexible, flow line arrangement 10 releasably con nected to the first arrangement 7 , where the first arrange ment terminates near the surface, so as to extend the first ar rangement. As the first flow line arrangement and the column can articulate they have good ability to absorb lateral loads and impacts, and to cope with extensive movement at the surface end of the second flow line arrangement. The system is there fore well suited for use in considerable water depths, and as it can articulate the column can be made slim which facilitates its handling during installation and removal.
