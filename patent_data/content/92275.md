# Magnetic tape deck.

## Abstract
A magnetic tape deck for magnetic tape cassettes 1 comprises a playing loop device with playing loop guides 8 which withdraw the magnetic tape 2 from the cassette to form a playing loop, and fast winding means which, for facilitat ing fast winding between the two reels 3 of the cassette, only slightly withdraw the magnetic tape from the cassette so as to form a fast winding loop such that the front of the magnetic tape is in contact with at least one draining element for drain ing static electricity from the front of the magnetic tape. The draining element 16 is arranged on a movable playing loop guide support 10 in a position substantially opposite the play ing loop guide 8 and on the opposite side of the magnetic tape.
