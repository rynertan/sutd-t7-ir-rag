Fie, 4 represents the diagrammatic detail of the key.In Fig. 5 the various letters indicate The feeder of theKEYROARD T , MICROPROCESSOR NSC , BUFFER 1 BU 1 for controlling the printing head, BUFFER 2 BU 2 for controlling the printer motor, PRINTER ST in which is seenMOTOR M since it requires a specific control BU 2 . The microprocessor sequentially scans the keyboard the functional groups of the keyboard and memorizes the pressed keys as long as a key on the entire keyboard remains Dressed, then it proceeds to decoding the combination and memorizes them.At each complete scan of the keyboard, it verifies the contents of the storage when the storage content reaches a present number of characters, it gives an execution order to the printer, or proceeds to the transmission of the data to external connections video, processor, photocomposer, electronic, typewriter, etc. . In case a printer is used, it verifies the maximum number of complete words that can be contained in a line of print and possibly decides that the last characters contained in the line are printed successively. Tt is further provided that the equipment under discussion can automatically generate abbreviation either of the ending or entire word by omitting the central vowel of the. sy lable so that the microprocessor automatically recopni zes by what is not written what is to be written.For example, considering the word graph if the vowel a is omitted, the microprocessor will identify the irreguZa rity by the lack of a , will then search in its memory the code graph which can correspond to a word such as graphic or similar precoded wordsThe microprocessor will interpret this as an abbreviation and will make the search as provided, by depressing key 40, whereby it will automatically generate the complete and correct word, graph, elimininating the error.It is provided that elements known in se can be replaced by other equivalent known elements without going outside the scope of protection of the invention.
