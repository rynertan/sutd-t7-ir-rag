# Rear projection screen.

## Abstract
In the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein a rear projection screen has a projection surface and a viewing surface with one of the surfaces formed so as to serve as a lens to provide bright stripe portions where the light passes and dark stripe portions where no light passes. Grooves are formed in the viewing surface along the dark stripe portions and thread like members are disposed in these grooves as light absorbing means. The lens formed in the screen surface may be formed of lenticules grooves having total reflection surfaces provided on both sides thereof and a Fresnel lens may be provided on the projection side surface. The thread like members may be self adhesive and may be disposed under tension in a screen having a curved surface. A diffusion agent and or a light absorbing colorant may be mixed into a medium constituting the screen.
