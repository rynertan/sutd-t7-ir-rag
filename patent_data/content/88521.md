# IMPROVEMENTS IN SOUND DISPLAY SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is described for modulating a colour display in which the blended colour is dependent upon the magnitude of N electrical signals which vary with the parameters of an audio signal. Known colour pattern generators contain too many variables for a watching sub ject to be able to correlate them. This invention displays a single blended colour which is related to the characteristics of the sound input.
