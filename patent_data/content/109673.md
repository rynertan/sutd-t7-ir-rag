## Description
Specification Game BoardThe invention relates to a game board comprising a board member constituted by the steps of piling or stacking a surface plate of synthetic resin on which frame lines or patterns for the game are printed on a cover member of the same material as that of said surface plate in such a manner that an extremely thin iron foil or leaf is interposed in the middle portion thereof, and implementing thermal adhesion to the outer peripheral edges of said surface plate and said cover member to be integrated thereby, and a piece member of a rubber magnet which can be attracted on said surface plate by said interposed iron foil.More in detail the present device relates to a pocketable game board capable of attracting game pieces on the board surface, making good use of magnetic force of a magnet.There are various kinds of game boards, such as, Othello , go or chess wherein man plays by moving piece or chessman having a predetermined shape on the board surface. Particularly, most of so called pocketable game boards are constituted so that the whole construction becomes compact in conformity with pocketable purpose such that the piece members are attracted on the board surface by the magnetic force of a magnet, in order that the assembled piece members do not inadvertently move or drop on the board surface.Such conventional magnet type game boards are such that an iron plate is interposed within the board, and the piece member is constituted with a magnet or an attached magnet. However, with the conventional magnet type game boards, there arise following problems The weight of the whole board is heavy and the thickness thereof is thick because of the iron plate interposed therein, resulting in remarkable inconveniences for the portable purpose.The cutting processing of the iron plate and inserting work into the board are troublesome, resulting in difficulty in fabricating the board. The board surface can become easily destroyed because of the weight and sharpness of the iron plate inserted therein, resulting in short life during usage.The present invention is proposed in order to avoid the various kinds of problems stated above, and the objects thereof are to provide a magnet type game board which is capable of completely attracting piece members, is extremely light in total weight to improve portability. It is simple in fabrication and processing thereof, and can be fabricated at low costs. To achieve these objects, the game board according to the present device is constituted by a board member of synthetic resin in which an extremely thin iron foil or leaf is provided, and a piece member the whole of which is made of a rubber magnet.A way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings which illustrate only one specific embodyment, thereby further clarifying the content of the present device, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating the closed condition of a board member,Fig. 2 is an unfolded perspective view showing the usage condition of the game board and the piece member according to a preferred embodiment of the invention,Fig. 3 is a perspective view of one edge part wherein the part of the game board as shown in Fig. 2 is presented in an exploded manner and in an enlarged scale,Fig. 4 is a cross sectional view partially showing the board member, andFig. 5 is a front cross sectional view illustrating an example of the piece member in an enlarged scale.The board member 10 comprises a surface plate 11 consisting of a transparent synthetic resin thin plate of which surface is flat, wherein frame lines 11 a for an Othello game as shown, patterns for other various kinds of other games, or the like can also be printed on the rear surface of the transparent synthetic resin thin plate, and the whole rear surface thereof is suitably coloured.The board member 10 is fabricated by the steps of. piling or stacking the surface plate 11 on a cover member 12 in such a manner that an extremely thin iron foil or leaf 13 and a cardboard 14 serving as a core member, and implementing thermal adhesion 15 to the outer peripheral edges of these surface plate 11 and the cover member 12, as shown in Fig. 4. The surface plate 11 and the cover member can consist of vinyl chloride or similar material.An iron foil fabricated by Tohyo Kohban Kabushiki Kaisha may be used as the iron foil 13 state above. The iron foil is an extremely thin pure iron sheet fabricated from an electrolyte containing iron component therein by an electro casting or forming method. With the conventional steal foil fabricated by rolling, the thickness thereof is more than 50 m, micrometer and there occurs directional property or anisotropy in mechanical characteristics. On the contrary, the iron foil used in the present device consists of an extremely thin sheet of a thickness of about 20 m, and there does not occur anisotropy. Accordingly, the iron foil has simple cutting processing and improved characteristic in strength, and is extremely light.The board member 10 thus constructed forms a pocketable structure so that the entire portion is folded along the crease 16 provided in the central portion. Thus, the board member 10 is designed so as to suit the pocketable purpose. However, the board member 10 my be constructed as a flat plate. The appearance or shape of the board member 10 is optional.In Figs. 2 and 5, reference numeral 20 denotes an example of a piece member used in the present device. The piece member 20 consists of a so called rubber magnet into which fine particles of a permanent magnet steel are mixed. Suitable print 21 is applied or implemented on both surfaces, or one surface. In the case of the Othello game as shown, the prints 21, 21 of white and blue color are implemented on the front and rear surfaces of the piece member 20 of a rubber magnet formed as a small disk, respectively. It is needless to say, that the shape and the colour of the piece member 20 may be selected in accordance with the kinds of the game board. The game board according to the present invention consists of the board member 10 and the piece member 20 stated above. Accordingly, the piece member 20 of the rubber magnet is freely attracted on the surface plate 11 of the board member 10 into which the iron foil 13 is inserted, and is able to be removed and moved.Accordingly, it is possible to play the game witout inadvertently moving or dropping off of the piece member 20 due to vibration and the like. Thus, the present device can provide improved pocketability and vibration proof. Particularly, according to the present device, the extremely thin iron foil 13 is used as a magnetic material provided in the board member 10. For this reason, the present invention makes it possible to remarkably reduce the weight of the board member 10 and become the thickness of the board member 10 as thin as possible, resulting in the provision of the game board suitable for pocketable purpose. Further, since the processing of the iron foil 13 is extremely simple, the following advantages will occur The cutting processing or inserting work into the board member 10 is simple. The fabrication cost of the board member 10 is reduced to a great extent. The problem that the iron foil 13 injures of the surface plate 11 or of the cover member 12 do not occur, result in long life during use.As stated above, the game board according to the present invention can provide excellent pocketability and excellent utility in respect of the fabrication and processing, and therefore is extremely suitable for the exercise of various games, such as Othello game.
