# Hinge structure.

## Abstract
First and second structures are hingedly connected by the engagement of a hinge pin 24 by a hinge knuckle 22 . Knuckle 22 is rigidly mounted on the first structure. Pin 24 is attached to a carrier that is slidably mounted on the second structure. A spring, preferably a plurality of stacks of Belleville springs, is positioned between the carrier and the second structure. The slidable mount allows the two structu res to move translationally relative to each other to prevent excessive hinge loads. The spring controls such movement and biases the hinge pin, and therefore the hinge axis, into a center position.
