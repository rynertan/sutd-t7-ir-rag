## Description
TITLE LAMINATED MATERIALSDESCRIPTION The invention relates to laminated materials which are useful as wrapping materials or packaging materials for foodstuffs. Aluminium and multi layer plastics sheets have heretofore been used as food packaging materials they are moulded by techniques such as stretch forming and thermoforming to produce food packaging containers. However, containers made of aluminium have disadvantages in that they are readily subject to breakage or deformation during filling or transportation in particular, such deformation leads to a serious reduction in product value since the deformed containers cannot be restored.Multi layer plastics sheets include those sheets made of polyolefins and polystyrenes. In addition,to increase the hygienic or decorative effect, those materials with an aluminium vaccum deposited layer laminated on the surface thereof have been proposed. Although these laminated materials are sufficiently applicable for use as packaging materials, they suffer from disadvantages in that in producing various containers the surface becomes uneven and is readily scratched, and there cannot be obtained the decorative effect of the lustre of aluminium. Furthermore, they are inferior in respect of gas barrier properties, light shielding properties, heat resistance, and so forth.Another type of laminated material which has been proposed is produced by laminating a multilayer consisting of a vacuum deposited metallic layer as an inner layer and a thermoplastic resin sheet as an outer layer on a soft type resin such as low density polyethylene by an extrusion lamination process.These materials, when produced in combination with those sheets having high rigidity, suffer from disadvantages in that when they are treated under high temperature sterilizing conditions, the vacuum deposited metallic layer is scattered, and they become unsuitable for practical use. Thus, they are limited in their utilization. The invention provides a laminated material comprising A a layer composed mainly of polyolefin B a layer composed mainly of a saponified product of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, a polyamide resin or a polyester resin C a vacuum deposited metallic layer and D a layer composed mainly of a transparent thermoplastic resin. Polyolefins which can be used in the preparation of layer A include polypropylene, copolymers of propylene and other monomers e.g., a olefin , high density polyethylene, medium density polyethylene, and low density polyethylene.Polypropylene and high density polyethylene are preferred. Between layer A and layer B as described hereinafter may be sandwiched a layer of polyolefin modified with an unsaturated carboxylic acid or a derivative of an unsaturated carboxylic acid.Polyolefins which may be used in the preparation of such modified polypropylenes include propylene homopolymer, block copolymers or random copolymers of propylene and other co rrr naners e.g., ethylene , ethylene homopolymer, and copolymers of ethylene and other a olefins. Unsaturated carboxylic acids which can be used include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, citraconic acid, sorbic acid, mesaconic acid, and angelic acid. Their derivatives include acid anhydrides, esters, amides, imides, and metal salts. Specific examples of such unsaturated carboxylic acid derivatives include maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, methyl acrylate, acrylamide, maleimide, and sodium acrylate.Modification of polyolefin with unsaturated carboxylic acid or its derivative may be performs by any suitable procedure. For example, the polyolefin and maleic anhydride may be heated in combination with a radical polymerization initiator in the presence or absence of a solvent to obtain the desired modified polyolefin. In this case, vinyl monomers such as styrene, or rubbers such as liquid rubber and thermoplastic rubber may be added to the reaction system. The unsaturated carboxylic acid or its derivative content of the modified polypropylene is usually from 0.001 to 15 by weight and preferably from 0.005 to 10 by weight. The term modified polyolefin as used herein also includes a mixture of modified polyolefin and unmodified polypropylene. Layer B of the laminated material of the invention is a gas barrier resin layer. There is no limitation on the composition of the saponified product of the ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. However, for the best gas barrier and oil resistance properties, it is preferred to use products resulting from the saponification of ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers having an ethylene content of from 25 to 50 mole , the degree of saponification being at last 93 and preferably at least 96 . Polyamide resins are linear synthetic polymers containing CONH linkages which are obtained by condensation of diamines and dicarboxylic acids, or self condensation of amino acids, or ring open polymerization of lactams.Typical examples of the polyamide resins that can be used include 6 nylon polycapramide , 6,6 nylon polyhexamethylene adipamide , 6,10 nylon polyhexamethylene sebacamide , ll nylon polyundecamide , and 12 nylon. Polyester resins are prepared by condensation of saturated dicarboxylic acids and glycols. Examples are polyethylene terephthalate produced from ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid polyethylene terephthalate copolymers containing a saturated dibasic acid, such as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, sebacic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, glutaric acid, succinic acid, and oxalic acid, as a copolymer component polyethylene terephthalate copolymers containing a diol component, such as 1,4 dihydroxymethyl cyclohexane, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or the like as a copolymer component and their mixture. Between layer B and layer C may be interposed, if desired, a layer of a synthetic resin. Synthetic resins which may be used for this purpose include polyethylene and polypropylene. Layer C of the laminated material of the invention is a vacuum deposited metallic layer.Usually, aluminium is used to form layer C. However, zinc, chromium, nickel, gold, silver or other metals may be used depending on the intended purpose of the laminated material. Layer D is composed mainly of a transparent thermoplastic resin. Preferably it is a non stretched film. There is no limitation on the thermoplastics resin as used herein. For example, polyamides, polymethyl methacrylates, polyethylenes, polypropylenes, polystyrenes, poly carbonates, polyvinyl chlorides, polyvinylidene chlorides, polyesters, and saponified products of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are suitable.When it is desired for the laminated material to have good lustre, polyamide, polymethyl methacrylate, etc. are selected. On the other hand, when it is desired to obtain a matted surface, polypropylene, etc are selected. Between layer C and layer D there may, if desired, be a coloured coating layer. This coloured coating layer may be formed by coating the thermoplastic resin layer D with d coating material having the desired colour. The thicknesses of the layers of the laminated material of the invention are not critical. A suitable ratio would be layer A modified polyolefin layer layer B layer C layer D 100 200 5 30 10 100 0.03 0.08 20 100. To produce the laminated material of the invention, the layers are bonded together by any suitable procedure. For example, in the case of dry lamination, an adhesive is coated, and in the case of extrusion lamination, a thin film of the above described modified polyolefin, for example, is used.In the former dry lamination, a suitable adhesive is selected from known adhesives. A suitable example is an epoxy resin based adhesive. When the laminated material of the invention is required to treat at high temperatures for the purpose of, e.g., sterilization, a specific adhesive for dry lamination is placed between the metal vacuum deposited layer and the resin layer. Dry lamination adhesives which can be used include polyester or polyether based polyurethane resins, and acrylic resins, such as acrylic acid alkyl ester and methacrylic acid alkyl ester. The amount of the adhesive coated is from 2 to 10 g m2 and preferably from 1.5 to 8 g m Suitable solvents include aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, and halogen containing hydrocarbons. The foregoing adhesive is coated between the vacuum deposited metallic layer and the resin layer by means of a dry laminator and dried and, thereafter, the two layers are laminated on each other to form the desired laminated material. In producing the laminated material of the invention , it is preferred to employ a process in which a laminated material of layers A and B and a laminated material of layers C and D are previously produced, and the two laminated materials are then laminated on each other. In accordance with this process, it is possible to apply a vacuum deposition of a metal, e.g., aluminium, onto a thin film, which will lead to a great increase in productivity. The laminated material of the invention can be moulded into containers and the like by techniques such as moulding under vacuum, and moulding under vacuum and pressure. The laminated material of the invention possesses the decorative effect due to metallic lustre by using a coloured coating layer in combination, there can be obtained a colour decorative effect. Since the laminated material of the invention is superior in gas barrier properties, light shielding properties, and moisture resistance, when it is used as a container, for example, the contents can be stored therein for a long period of time. Furthermore, since the container is less subject to breakdown or deformation and even if it is deformed it can be easily restored, therefore, a reduction in product value does not occur. By suitably selecting the synthetic resin to be used in the laminated material, it becomes possible to apply a retort processing onto the resulting container.With laminated materials in which the above described adhesives are placed between the vacuum deposited metallic layer and the resin layer, heat resistance is superior and it is possible to apply a high temperature sterizing treatment. In this case,the vacuum deposited metallic layer is stable and is not scattered. Accordingly, the laminated material of the invention is useful as a packaging material and particularly as a material for use in the production of food packaging containers. The laminated material of the invention is illustrated in the drawings, of which Figure 1 is a schematic view showing an embodiment of the laminated material of the invention and Figure 2 is a schematic view showing another embodiment of the laminated material of the invention.
