# Process for hydrocracking a hydrocarbonaceous feed with hydrogen recovery and recycle.

## Abstract
Efficient utilization of hydrogen in a hydrocracking system is obtained by recovering in a first gas liquid separation zone 20 hydrogen by gas liquid separation of hydrocrackate 14 at a pressure of at least about 75 percent of the pressure in the hydrocracking zone 10 , and recover ing in a second gas liquid separation zone 26 hydrogen from the separated liquid phase 24 from the first gas liquid separation zone 20 , said second gas liquid separation zone 26 being at a pressure less than 75 percent of the pressure in the first gas liquid separation zone 20 and at conditions sufficient to provide a separated vapor phase 30 containing at least about 50 volume percent of hydrogen and having a hydrogen partial pressure of at least about 20 atmospheres. At least a portion of the separated vapor phase 30 from the second gas liquid separation zone 26 is contacted with the feed side of a polymeric membrane, in a permeator 34 exhibiting a high selectivity to the permeation of hydrogen as compared to the permeation of methane. The opposite side, i.e., permeate side, of the membrane is maintained at a pressure sufficiently below the pressure on the feed side of the membrane such that the ratio of the total pressure on the feed side to total pressure on the feed side to total pressure on the permeate side of the membrane is at least about 3 1 to permeate hydrogen to the permeate side of the membrane and provide a hydrogen permeate 38 having a concentra tion of hydrogen greater than the concentration of hydrogen in the separated vapor phase 30 contacting the membrane. At least a portion of the hydrogen permeate 38 is recycled to the hydrocracking zone 10 . Thus, the second gas liquid separation zone 26 co acts with the polymeric membrane separation to provide a highly useable, recovered hydrogen stream in the hydrocracking system.
