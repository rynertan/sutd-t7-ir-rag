## Description
Chymosin also called rennin E.C. 3.2.23.4 is an enzyme isolated from the fourth stomach of the calf. It is valued for its ability to produce milk curds by catalyzing the hydrolysis of kappa casein to para kappa casein which, in the presence of calcium ion, precipitates as the insoluble curd calcium paracaseinate. After removal of the whey, the curd is processed to make various types of cheeses. Although several proteolytic enzymes will clot milk, the best cheeses have been produced from milk clotted with preparations rich in chymosin. The availability of chymosin and ultimately its price depends upon the demand for veal, since the production of chymosin diminishes, and the production of pepsin increases, as the animal matures and is weaned. Enzymes similar to chymosin have been extracted from microorganisms fungi, especially Bovine calf chymosin exists as two isozymes designated A and B , which can be resolved by DEAE cellulose chromatography of the crystalline enzyme. Isozyme B, which may be catalytically less efficient than isozyme A, is the more abundant form in tissue extracts. Bovine calf chymosin isozyme B has been sequenced, and isozyme A has been partially sequenced, to reveal only one amino acid difference at residue 290 glycine in B and aspartic acid in A see Foltmann, B. et al., Chymosin is synthesized within the cells of the stomach lining in a precursor form known as preprochymosin. The pre portion of preprochymosin is a sequence of amino acids located at the amino terminus. These amino acids comprise a signal peptide which appears to be involved in the transport of the protein to the cell wall for secretion into the periplasmic space. The signal peptide is cleaved at the cell wall and the enzyme is secreted as prochymosin. Prochymosin is a zymogen containing 365 amino acids 40,477 Daltons . Prochymosin is converted to chymosin by the specific removal of 42 N terminal amino acids. The conversion of prochymosin to chymosin is favored by the low pH environment of the stomach. Particular attention has been directed to studying the conversion of prochymosin to chymosin. Prochymosin was first reported by Hammersten in 1872 Hammersten, O., Foltmann and coworkers have studied the conversion of natural prochymosin to chymosin Pedersen, V.B. and Foltmann, B., With the advent of recombinant DNA technology, it has become possible to produce prochymosin by the expression, in a transformed microorganism, of cDNA encoding the amino acid sequence of prochymosin under the control of a promoter and regulatory sequence. European Patent Application No. 84304682.9 of Genex Corporation describes a method of producing chymosin which involves expressing a DNA sequence encoding a fusion protein. The fusion protein comprises an N terminal fragment of a bacterial protein normally associated with the promoter sequence e.g., the β subunit of tryptophan synthetase fused to activatable prochymosin . The activatable prochymosin comprises the amino acid sequence of mature chymosin together with a sufficient portion of its presequence at least about 15 amino acid residues such that the product can undergo post translational autocatalytic cleavage to produce active chymosin. In addition to a portion of the presequence, the prochymosin fusion product can contain part or all of the signal peptide of preprochymosin and or a short linker sequence of amino acids, the latter being situated between the N terminal fragment of the bacterial protein and the amino acid residues of prochymosin or preprochymosin . The linker sequence in the expressed protein results from the translation of a synthetic DNA linker sequence which serves to fuse the DNA sequence encoding the bacterial protein fragment to the DNA sequence encoding prochymosin or preprochymosin in the expression vector and to keep the reading frames of the sequences encoding the two segments in phase. The expression product, i.e., the prochymosin fusion protein, forms an insoluble precipitate within the cells. After cell lysis, this precipitate is both insoluble in conventional solvents for proteins and incapable of undergoing activation by autocatalytic cleavage to produce mature chymosin. The inability of the expression product to self activate is believed to be related to improper folding of the expressed protein, which in turn is related to the unnatural environment of the microbial host in which it is expressed. Processes for the solubilisation of insoluble chymosin precursor by denaturation, followed by a renaturation to form the native form of the chymosin precursor are e.g. described in EP A 0068691, EP A 0122080, No 83 04418 or No 84 03711. The denaturants used in said documents include aqueous solutions of urea or guanidine hydrochloride or alkaline solutions of pH between pH 9.5 and 11.5. This invention is based on our discovery that microbially produced bovine prochymosin can be recovered and activated by a process which comprises The process of the invention provides a method for recovering and activating microbially produced bovine prochymosin. As used herein, the term microbially produced prochymosin refers to bovine prochymosin which is produced by expression in a microbial host e.g., Microbially produced prochymosin can be produced by expression, in a transformant, of a DNA sequence, under the control of a trp promoter, encoding an N terminal fragment of the subunit of tryptophan synthetase fused to the amino acid sequence of prochymosin less its first two amino acids . The sequence encoding the first 27 amino acids of the β subunit of tryptophan synthetase is linked to the prochymosin encoding sequence through a linker sequence which encodes the residues An When the microbially produced bovine prochymosin is expressed in a non secreting host such as The microbially produced bovine prochymosin, which is contained in the centrifugation pellet, can be employed as the starting material in the process of our invention. The microbially produced bovine prochymosin is solubilized in a strong base such as NaOH, at a pH of about 12.0 or greater. The solution can be produced by resuspending the centrifugation pellet containing the microbially produced bovine prochymosin in a dilute sodium hydroxide solution to the desired protein concentration. The denatured microbially produced bovine prochymosin is then renatured, by diluting the base and or reducing the pH, this is preferably achieved by diluting the solution with deionized water and adjusting to a pH of about 8.5 to 10.5 and incubating at this pH in the presence of a buffer such as glycine. Incubation is carried out at a temperature which promotes renaturation. The incubation temperature generally ranges from about 4 C to 37 C. Incubation is continued until the microbially produced bovine prochymosin has reconformed so that it is capable of undergoing conversion to active chymosin. The time of incubation will depend somewhat upon the temperature at which the incubation is carried out. We have found that incubation for 48 hours at 4 C effectively restores activity to microbially produced bovine prochymosin. We have found that denaturation by NaOH concentrations equal to or greater than 0.01 M, for periods of time in excess of a few minutes inhibits subsequent renaturation of prochymosin to a form capable of undergoing conversion to active chymosin. The amount of time at which the prochymosin can be held under denaturing conditions without significantly affecting renaturation depends on the concentration of the base and the temperature. When denaturation is effected by addition of 0.1 M NaOH at room temperature, we have found that dilution of the NaOH to renature the prochymosin is preferably carried out immediately after denaturing conditions are achieved. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the centrifugation pellet is resuspended in a chilled solution of a chelating agent such as tetrasodium ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid about 10mM at a protein concentration of about 10 mg ml or greater. The resulting slurry is solubilized and denatured by the addition of NaOH to a final concentration of about 0.1M . The solubilization product, which is highly viscous, is immediately diluted 10 fold with deionized water and the pH adjusted to 10.0 by the addition of glycine. Final glycine concentrations can be from 10mM to 50mM. Renaturation is then performed by incubating at about 24 C for 20 to 24 hours. Following renaturation, the microbially produced bovine prochymosin, having assumed the configuration of the naturally produced material, can be converted to active chymosin by techniques which serve to cleave the presequences of amino acids from the sequence of mature active chymosin. While this can be achieved using exogenous proteolytic enzymes, we prefer to convert the renatured prochymosin to chymosin by lowering the pH of the solution containing the prochymosin to below about 2.5 to produce active pseudochymosin and then adjusting the pH to about 4.0 to 7.0, preferably about 6.0, which causes the pseudochymosin to convert to active mature chymosin. In the practice of the invention, we have carried out the conversion to pseudochymosin by lowering the pH of the solution to about 2.0 by the addition of a non oxidizing acid, such as hydrochloric acid, and allowing the solution to stand at 4 C. Since active pseudochymosin is highly soluble at pH 2.0, extraneous proteins from the host cell in which the prochymosin was expressed can be conveniently salted out by adjusting the solution to 0.2 0.3 M sodium chloride, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 xg. to precipitate the extraneous proteins. The active pseudochymosin is present in the final solution in low concentration. Concentrated and more highly purified solutions can be obtained by adsorption of the chymosin on a cation exchange resin with pKa of less than 2.5. The resin may be conveniently washed with pH 2 buffer to remove non adsorbed contaminating protein and then extracted with a buffer solution with a pH of 6.0 to remove adsorbed chymosin. At pH 6.0, the pseudochymosin undergoes proteolysis to active mature chymosin. Alternatively, following the conversion of prochymosin to pseudochymosin by acidification to pH 2.5 or below, the pseudochymosin may be purified and matured to chymosin by a simple titration to pH 6.0 to 6.5 with sodium phosphate. This titration results in the precipitation of extraneous proteins that can be removed by centrifugation at 10,000 xg. or less. The chymosin containing supernatant from the centrifugation can be concentrated to final form by adsorption to an anion exchange resin such as DEAE cellulose Wattman DE 52 followed by elution with 0.5 M NaCl in 50 mM sodium phosphate bufer at pH 6.0 to 6.5 precipitation by ammonium sulfate 60 saturation or saturated sodium chloride followed by resolubilization in sodium acaetate or sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5 to 6.5, or ultrafiltration with a 10,000 nominal molecular weight cutoff. The mature chymosin is stable when refrigerated in pH 6.0 buffer, and may be formulated with stabilizers, coloring agents, etc. or it may be lyophilized to produce a dry powder. The enzyme thus produced may be employed as any conventional rennet extracted from calf stomach, e.g., in cheese making. The pellet was extracted with 1600 ml and 0.01 N sodium hydroxide, and titrated to a pH of 12 to solubilize the prochymosin fusion protein. The solution was then diluted to 4 liters with deionized water. Glycine 15.2 grams was added as a buffer and the solution was titrated to pH 9.5 with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid. The solution was allowed to stand for 48 hours at 4 C to allow renaturation of the prochymosin fusion protein. The solution was then titrated with hydrochloric acid to pH 2, and allowed to stand for four hours to allow conversion of prochymosin fusion protein to chymosin. Sodium chloride 70.13 grams was added and the suspension centrifuged at 10,000 x G. The supernate containing chymosin was decanted and diluted to 6 liters with deionized water. An ion exchange resin with a pKa near 2.0 Whatman SE 53 was equilibrated with 0.05 M glycine, pH 2.5, and suspended in the diluted supernate. The suspension was agitated for 30 minutes, allowed to stand overnight and the supernate was decanted. The resin, containing adsorbed chymosin, was resuspended in 100 ml of cold 0.05 M phosphoric acid. After centrifugation, the supernate was discarded and the resin resuspended in a minimal amount of 0.05 M monobasic sodium phosphate, and titrated to pH 6 to desorb the chymosin. The suspension was shaken and then centrifuged at 14,500 x G. The supernate I was collected and the resin resuspended in 0.05 M monobasic sodium phosphate pH 6 including 0.9 M sodium chloride to desorb additional chymosin. After shaking, the suspension was centrifuged and the supernate II collected. Supernates I and II were tested for chymosin activity using the method described below. Supernate I was determined to contain 7.5 units of chymosin supernate II had 1.9 units of chymosin. Chymosin activity was assayed by its ability to precipitate Kappa casein in an acidic environment. Dilutions of the enzyme in 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 5.5 are incubated at room temperature for 24 hours with 2 mg ml Kappa casein purified from either whole milk or dehydrated milk, Zittle, C.A. and Caster, S.H., The pellet was resuspended in 126 ml. of chilled 10 mM ethylenediaminetetracetic acid tetrasodium salt. The material was then solubilized by addition of 14 ml. of 1
