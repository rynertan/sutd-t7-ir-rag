# MULTIPLE COMMUNICATION INTERFACE BETWEEN PROCESSOR AND DIGITAL TRANSMISSION MEANS

## Abstract
A multiple communications interface between processor and digital transmission means, such as a serial 32 channel 64 Kbit s PCM group, able to utilize the group channels as an equal number of two way communications paths between the processor and other nodes of a data communications system. Each path can be used for the interchange of data messages according to dialogue procedures of HDLC type, such as X25, X75 and No. 7 of CCITT.
