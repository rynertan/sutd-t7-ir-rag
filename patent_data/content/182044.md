# Initialization apparatus for a data processing system with a plurality of input output and storage controller connected to a common bus.

## Abstract
A plurality of controllers are connected to a common bus 11 in turn connected to a central processor 10 . Each of the controllers 18, 19, 19A respectively serves as an interface between the central processor and at least one storage unit 12, 13 or input output device 14 . In order for the controllers to distinguish between addresses, the ad dresses sent from the central processor contain identifier segments indicative of the controller to which the address is being sent. Controllers in turn contain programmable comparison means 20, 21, 22 for comparing the identifier segments in addresses to a stored controller identifier in dicative of the controller. Because the comparison means are programmable, controller identifiers have to be set up each time the system is turned on. Consequently, the present invention provides such turn on or initialization means including a read only initialization program stored in one of the storage units the controller interfacing with this storage unit becomes a master controller the master con troller has apparatus which is selectively activated only during initialization for accepting all addresses irrespective of the identifier segment. The other controllers have ap paratus selectively activated only during initialization for disabling the comparison means and such other controllers so that no addresses are accepted by the other controllers during the initialization. In other words, the comparison means in the master controller is completely bypassed during initialization whereby the read only initialization pro gram is accessed only through the master controller.
