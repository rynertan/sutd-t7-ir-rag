# Oxygen sensor for and method of determining concentration of oxygen.

## Abstract
An oxygen sensor for determining the partial pressure of oxygen in a monitored gas environment includes a diffusion housing of zirconia based material having a gas diffusion aper ture, an oxygen ion conductive plate of zirconia based material, a pair of electrode layers mounted on opposite sides of the con ductive plate, and a sealing glass material sealingly bonding the conductive plate at one side to the housing to provide a diffu sion chamber defined by the diffusion housing and the conduc tive plate. The electrodes are connectable to a power source for being supplied with an electric potential to pump oxygen ion out of the diffusion chamber through the conductive plate to flow a current through the electrodes which current is indica tive of the partial pressure of the oxygen in the monitored gas environment. The sealing glass material contains SiO₂, BaO, Na₂O and ZrO₂.
