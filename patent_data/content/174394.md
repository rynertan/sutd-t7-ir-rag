# REFLEX REFLECTOR

## Abstract
A reflex reflector 11 has a reflector body 12 , and attaching means 13 which are provided on the right and left sides of the reflector body 12 , and is adapted to be attached between spokes 5 of a spoked wheel. Each of the attaching means 13 includes a passage 14 for fitting a spoke 5 therein laterally of the wheel, and the passage 14 has lateral surfaces positioned laterally of the fitted spoke and back surfaces positioned at the back. The attaching means 13 further includes lateral projections 18, 19 projecting to the lateral surfaces of the passage 14 and adapted to make the width of the passage 14 smaller than the diameter of the spoke 5 . The lateral projections 18, 19 have elasticity which allows the amount of projection from the lateral surfaces of the passage to be decreased, whereby the spoke 5 is allowed to move beyond the lateral projections 18, 19 to reach a predetermined position. The attaching means 13 further includes a back projection 20 projecting to the back surfaces of the passage 14 , and the back surface 20 has elasticity which allows the amount of projection from the passage 14 to be decreased.
