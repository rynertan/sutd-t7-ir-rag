# Thermoplastic composition.

## Abstract
A thermoplastic composition which comprises a blend comprising 20 to 80 by weight of a polycarbonate resin and 80 to 20 by weight of a graft polymer obtained by grafting at least one aromatic vinyl compound and at least one of vinyl cyanides and alkyl unsaturated carboxylates onto a conjugated diene rubber or its mixture with a copolymer of at least one aromatic vinyl compound and at least one of vinyl cyanides and alkyl unsaturated carboxy lates in an amount of not more than 90 by weight on the basis of the combined amount of the graft polymer and the copolymer, and a polyolefin or a plasticizer having a light transmission of not less than 70 when determined on the film of 20 microns in thickness prepared by the use of a solution of the plasticizer 0.25 g and acrylonitrilestyrene copolymer weight ratio of acrylonitrile and styrene, 30 70 0.75g in acetone 10 ml , the weight proportion of the blend and the polyolefin or the plasticizer being 100 0.2 20. The resulting composition is excellent in solvent resistance, welding strength, impact resistance, molding property, etc.
