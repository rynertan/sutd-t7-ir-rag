# Multiple valved internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A multiple valved internal combustion engine has three intake valves 4,4,4 and two exhaust valves 5,5 for a common cylinder 1 . The three intake valves 4,4,4 and the two exhaust valves 5,5 are disposed in a cylinder head 2 on a common pitch circle centered on the center line of a combustion chamber 3 in the head 2 with the intake valves on one side of the circle and the exhaust valves on the other side. According to the invention, the radial disposition of the valves 4,4,4 and 5,5 is such that axial lines of these valves cross one another at a point on an axial line of the cylinder 1 . Further, an ignition plug 6 is positioned between the two exhaust valves 5,5 and is inserted through the cylinder head 2 in an inclined posture such that its forward end is directed towards the center of the combustion chamber 3 . Also a single common cam shaft 7 driving all the intake and exhaust valves 4,4,4 and 5,5 is provided horizontally at an intermediate position of the cylinder head 2 between the zone of the intake valves and the zone of the exhaust valves. Since the three intake valves are disposed on one side, and the two exhaust valves are disposed on the other side on the pitch circle surrounding the center line of the combustion chamber in the radial disposition that axial lines of these valves cross one another at a point on an axial line of the cylinder, and since the ignition plug is positioned between the two exhaust valves in such an inclined posture that the forward end thereof is directed towards the center of the combustion chamber, an upper wall surface of the combust tion chamber may be formed as a concaved hemi spherical surface of small unevenness to assist combustion efficiency. Furthermore, since the cam shaft is provided at the interme diate position between the zone of the intake valves and the zone of the exhaust valves, it does not interfere with the ignition plug, and thereby there can be obtained a multiple valved engine of so called SOHC type wherein the cam shaft is a single common one, and this gives the advantages that the engine can be made small in size and weight.
