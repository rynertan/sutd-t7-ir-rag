# Pressure switch.

## Abstract
Increasing pressure acting under the thin plastic film diaphragm will move the actuator upward against the force of the outer reset spring until the upper inside washer seat engages the outer washer seat causing the inner trip spring to be compressed with further upward movement. Thereaf ter, switch actuation is opposed by both springs and the trip force is determined by both springs. As pressure decreases after the switch has tripped, the inside spring seat engages the shoulder on the actuator so only the reset spring is effective to determine the reset force. Both springs are assembled on the actuator prior to assembly in the pressure switch. The terminal structure is novel in the way it is positively located and accurately locates the switch.
