## Description
DRIVE TRANSMISSION ARRANGEMENTSThe invention concerns drive transmission arrangements, and has particular, though not exclusive, reference to such arrangements as applied in circumstances where the power supply and torque available are limited , ie manually operable devices, and in which large mechanical advantage is required. Such circumstances prevail, for example in the context of cycles, and in lifting devices.According to the present invention there is proposed a drive transmission arrangement comprising a manually actuable input member, a drive element coupled to the member to be driven, and a step up gearing arrangement remote from and independent of the said drive element.According to a preferred feature the said gearing arrangement is a multiple stage arrangement.According to a further preferred feature a spindle of the input member is arranged coaxially with and extends through a spindle of the gearing arrangement for rotational support thereby.The invention will now be described further by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings illustrating several embodiments thereof, and in which Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic plan view of a preferred form of the invention Fig. 2 is a sectional view corresponding to Fig. 1 and illustrates a practical form of the drive transmission shown therein Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic plan view of a second embodiment of the invention Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic side elevation of the drive transmission shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a front elevation of the rear freewheel and gearing mechanism Fig. 6 is a section on A A of Fig. 5 Fig. 7 is a section on B B of Fig. 5 Fig. 8 is a sectional elevation of the roller bevel wheel to an enlarged scale, andFig. 9 is an elevation of the worm and wheel drive arrangement to an enlarged scale Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to Fig. 1 thereof, in its preferred form the drive transmission of the invention comprises an input chain wheel 11 rotatably mounted in the bottom bracket of a bicycle frame 10, a drive sprocket 12 arranged coaxially with the rear wheel of the bicycle and coupled thereto through a free wheel and gearing mechanism described hereinafter, and a gearing arrangement 13 intermediate and drivingly connected with the input chain wheel 11 and the drive sprocket 12.The gearing arrangement 13 consists of two pairs of chain sprockets 14, 15 each secured to a respective spindle 25, 29 rotatably mounted in suitable bearings provided on the frame, the spindles 25, 29 being arranged in spaced apart, parallel disposition.The first pair of chain sprockets 14 of the gearing arrangement 13 includes an input sprocket 16 positioned in alignment with the input chain wheel 11 and drivingly connected therewith by suitable chain means 17 and an output sprocket 18 in alignment with and drivingly connected to the input sprocket 19 of the second pair 15 via chain means 20. The output sprocket 21 of the second pair of chain sprockets 15 is aligned with the drive sprocket 12 and is drivingly connected to such drive sprocket through a further chain means 22.The second pair of chain sprockets 15 is arranged coaxially with the input chain wheel 11 conveniently in the manner hereafter to be describedIt is proposed that the input sprockets 16, 19 of the respective pairs of chain sprockets shall have eighteen teeth, whilst the output sprocket 18, 21 shall, in each case, have fifty six teeth. It is furthermore proposed that the input chain wheel 11 shall have fifty six teeth and that the drive sprocket 12 shall have eighteen teeth.As will readily be appreciated, the gear ratio between the successive chain connected sprockets will be determined by the relative number of teeth on such sprockets, and accordingly a step up ratio in excess of thirty will result, thus to give an advance of approximately sixty metres for each pedal rotation for a cycle wheel of sixty six centimetre diameter.A practical form of the invention is illustrated in Fig. 2 and it will be seen that the spindle 25 of the first pair of chain sprockets 14 is eccentrically mounted in support plates 23, themselves rotationally movable in a bearing housing 24 secured to the frame 10, to provide for adjustment of the tension in chain means 17, 20.The spindle 28 of the second pair of chain sprockets 15 is of sleeve like form and receives the spindle 29 of the input chain sprocket 11 coaxially therein, suitable bearing means 30 being provided between spindles 28 and 29, and bearing means 39 between spindle 28 and housing 40 which is secured to frame 10.A jockey pulley, not shown, may be provided in respect of the further chain means 22.In an alternative arrangement, see now Figs. 3 and 4, the second pair of sprocket wheels is omitted, and accordingly the drive transmission is from input chain wheel 31 to the input sprocket 32 via a first chain means 33 and from output sprocket 34 to the drive sprocket 35 via a second chain means 36, sprockets 32, 34 being secured to a common spindle 37 and a jockey pulley 38 being provided in respect of chain means 36. With fifty six teeth on each of input chain wheel 31 and output sprocket 34 and eighteen teeth on input sprocket 32 and drive sprocket 35, a step up ratio of approximately nine results.It is to be understood that, although reference has been made to sprockets having fifty six teeth drivingly connected by chain means to sprockets having eighteen teeth, other combinations of sprocket teeth may be preferred in some instances so as, for example, to produce a lesser step up ratio. For example, the sprockets having fifty six teeth may conveniently be replaced by sprockets having forty two teeth to give a step up ratio of over twelve for the Fig. 1 embodiment and a step up ratio of over five for the Fig 3 embodiment. Whilst the drive transmission arrangements described above comprise chain sprockets and chain means, a direct connection through intermeshing gears, or other conventional drive connections such as belts and pulleys, may have application in some contexts, and the invention is to be construed accordingly.Referring now to Figs 5 to 7 there is shown the rear freewheel and gearing arrangement which provides for one of three gearing ratios to be selected. The input to the rear mechanism is through sprocket 12 or 35 as described above in relation toFigs 1 and 3 respectively.Sprocket 12 or 35 is secured to a sleeve like shaft 41 and onto the other end of shaft 41 is splined a sprocket 42 having three sets of rollers 43,44,45 disposed equi spaced around three respective pitch circles of differing diameters see Fig. 6 .One set of rollers meshes with the teeth of a respective sprocket of three sprockets 46,47,48 see Fig. 7 . The sprockets 46 to 48 are movable axially by means of a spring loaded toggle chain 49 so as to determine which of sprockets 46,47 and 49 is engaged by the respective set of rollers 43,44, 45. In this way the overall gearing ratio of the mechanism can be varied and a chain drive is dispensed with between sprocket 42 and sprockets 46 to 48. The sprockets 46, 47 and 48 are splined onto shaft 63, so as to allow for the aforementioned axial movement, on which there is also mounted a bevel wheel 51. Bevel wheel 50 drives a pinion 51, and the preferred form of the bevel wheel 50 and pinion 51 will be described hereinafter.Pinion 51 is secured to a shaft 52 which is integral with a worm 53. see Fig. 5 and a wheel 54 is in turn driven by worm 53. The preferred form of worm 53 and wheel 54 will be described hereinafter. Wheel 54 is secured to an output shaft 55 which is coaxially with sleeve like shaft 41, the latter being rotatably mounted on shaft 55 with intermediate bearings 56.In turn shaft 55 is also sleeve like and is rotatably mounted on wheel spindle 57 by means of intermediate bearings 58.The wheel hub 59 is rotatably mounted on spindle 57 by means of roller bearings 60 to accommodate the heavy transmission loading.Shaft 55 has formed at the end remote from wheel 54 fingers 61 which engage a freewheel 62 mounted on hub 59 so as to provide a forward drive to hub 59.Although a bevel wheel and pinion of known form may be used in the apparatus of this invention a bevel wheel and split pinion as shown in Fig 8 is preferred. Bevel wheel 50 comprises a hub 64 which is mounted on shaft 63 to rotate therewith and a conical flange 65 secured to hub 64.Located in outwardly tapered apertures 74 in flange 65 are two sets of rollers 66 disposed at inner and outer pitch circles, the rollers 66 in each ring being equi angularly spaced and there being an angular stagger and an overlap between the rollers of one ring and the rollers of the other ring. The rollers 66 of the inner ring engage one part 67 of split pinion 51 whilst the rollers 66 of the outer ring engage the other part 68 of split pinion 51. Due to the angular stagger and overlaps between the rollers 66 of one ring with those of the other ring at least one roller 66 is in engagement with the pinion 51 at all times, thus ensuring a smooth continuity of drive and no lip. The two parts 67 and 68 of pinion 51 have grooves 69 in their outer surfaces to receive rollers 66.The rollers 66 are biassed tznto contact with pinion 51 by means of a spring washer 70 which is located by its outer periphery in a circumferential groove 71 in flange 65. The free edge of washer 70 is biassed towards the flange 65 by means of a second spring washer 72 located in an annular groove 73 in hub 64. The pressure exerted by washers 70 on the rollers 66 is sufficient to induce sufficient friction as to ensure drive between the bevel wheel 50 and pinion 51 but at the same time to allow a limited amount of rotational motion of rollers 66 in order to reduce the friction of the drive arrangement. In this way the frictional torque is reduced and the efficency of the drive improved.In addition, although a worm and wheel of conventional form may be used in the apparatus of the invention, it is preferred that a recirculating ball worm and wheel drive as shown in Fig. 9 is used. The worm 53 has a substantially semicircular cross sectional helical groove 74 formed in its outer surface and the wheel 54 has substantially semicircular grooves 75 between the teeth 76, groove 74 and grooves 75 accommodatpg the balls 77 therein each of which is recirculated along guides 81 to the input end 78 after being driven out of contact with the wheel 54 at the output end 79 by the subsequent ball 77 being driven along the path of travel between the worm 53 and the wheel 54.The worm 53 as shown in Fig. 9 is stepped in that the outer diameter of the worm is reduced in the central region 80 by comparison with its axially outer regions so that the worm 53 and wheel 54 may engage throughout a greater angular travel of wheel 54 than would be the case with a worm of constant outer diameter. As an alternative the worm 53 could be formed having a venturi profile, ie be of reducing diameter towards the centre thereof, so as to envelop the wheel throughout a greater extent of its periphery. The use of recirculating balls 77 between the worm 53 and wheel 54 reduces the friction in the drive transmission and the torque required to transmit the loading, and increases the efficiency of the worm and wheel transmission. These effects are of particular importance in a man powered machine. The use of an enveloping worm is particularly suited to the transmission of very heavy loadings such as occur in the context of lifting apparatus, and also ensures a greater working life.The primary application of the invention is in the context of cycle propulsion, but other man powered applications are envisaged in the field of vehicle propulsion and load lifting devices, winches and the like.
