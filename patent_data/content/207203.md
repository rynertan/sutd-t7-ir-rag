# Electrostatic dust collector.

## Abstract
A filter element 2 comprises a narrow strip 6 of a pliable porous dielectric material having electrodes 7 embedded or sandwiched therein along the length thereof. A gas flow to be treated is constrained by a casing 1 or duct 21 to pass through the porous dielectric 6 while a voltage 8,22 is applied to the electrodes. The strip 6 of the filter element 2 is disorderly packed into the casing 1 or duct 21 . The dust collector thereby has the advantages of both a filter and an electrostatic dust collec tor as regards collecting a wide range of particle size and without requiring a very high voltage.
