# Centrifugal casting machine.

## Abstract
A centrifugal casting machine 20 has a first rotatable shaft 33 and a second rotatable shaft 45 as well as a rotat able core member 100 having a central opening, with at least one of these shafts being adapted for reciprocal movement so as to extend into the core member central opening and adja cent to the other one of the shafts 33 and 45 . First 73 and second 83 mould halves are located on opposite sides of the core member 100 and each is adapted to move inwardly and outwardly between open and closed positions. The mould halves 73 and 83 are rotatably supported on bearing means 75 and 85 and in closed position are adapted to rotate with the core member 100 and define a cavity 128 in combina tion therewith. The improvement takes the form of the addi tion of mould isolator means 130 and 132 between the bearing means 75 and 85 and the mould halves 73 and 83 . The isolator mechanisms 130 and 132 serve simul taneously as torque couplings, clamping force transmitters, misalignment adjusters, vibration dampers and thermal expansion providers.
