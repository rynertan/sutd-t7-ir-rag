# Method of producing a foundry core or mould involving the reaction of a polyisocyanate and a polyhidroxy composition, polyhidroxy composition for use in the method and foundry composition produced in the method.

## Abstract
A foundry mould or core is prepared by mixing with a foundry aggregate a polyisocyanate, a polymeric addition product of a phenol and a further material comprising aromatic hydroxyl groups, forming the mixture to the required shape and causing or permitting the polyisocyanate to react with both the addition product and the further material to bind the aggregate. The addition product may be prepared by reacting an unsaturated hydrocarbon with a phenol. The hydrocarbon may be comprised by a mixture of terpenes. The further hydroxy material may be a bisphenol or a phenolic resin.
