# Zirconia ceramics and a method of producing the same.

## Abstract
There are disclosed zirconia ceramics consisting mainly of ZrO₂ and Y₂O₃ in a molar ratio of Y₂O₃ ZrO₂ of 2 98 7 93 and consisting of crystal grains having a mixed phase comprising a tetragonal phase and a cubic phase or having a phase comprising a tetragonal phase, the average size of the crystal grains being not larger than 2µm such ceramics have a high strength and undergo little deteriora tion in strength with lapse of time. There is also disclosed a method of producing such zirconia ceramics, by mixing zirconium oxide having a crys tallite size of not larger than 1,000 Å or amorphous zir conium oxide with an yttrium compound in the above mix ing ratio, moulding the mixture into an article, and firing the moulded article at 1,000 to 1,550 C.
