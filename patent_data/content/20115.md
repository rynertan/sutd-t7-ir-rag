# Distance measuring system employing secondary radar.

## Abstract
A distance measuring system in which a first station radiates a modulated carrier wave and a second station receives that wave, and retransmits the modulation on a carrier wave back to the first station, which compares the phases of the original and received modulations. The second station includes a digital counter 19 which accumulates clock pulses 22 denoting the period of the modulation and a second counter is 26 incremented and decremented to reproduce the modulation for retransmission thereof.
