# Exercise responsive cardiac pacemaker.

## Abstract
An exercise responsive cardiac pacemaker 10 is pro vided which physiologically controls the stimulation rate of a heart 13 by sensing the venous blood temperature in the right vetricle 12 of the heart 13 . A temperature sensing means which includes a thermistor 11 produces an output signal which is sent to an algorithm implementing means 15 for implementing the output signal by an algorithm which represents the mathematical function between venous blood temperature in the right ventricle and heart rate in a normally functioning heart. The algorithm implementing means 15 produces an output signal which is variable between a maximum and minimum level corresponding to the desired maximum and minimum levels of heart rate in a normally functioning heart. The algorithm implementing means 15 is also programmable by telemetry after implan tation. A cardiac pacemaker 10 is connected to the algor ithm implementing means 15 and is responsive thereto in order to variably control the stimulation rate of the heart.
