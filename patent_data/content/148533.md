# LPG filling valve for a vehicle.

## Abstract
The invention is a filling valve on a vehicle for filling a fuel tank with LPG said valve having a housing 1 with a flat flange 2 whilst the fitting part 3 for the connection of the filling line and the non return valve 5, 6 with its seat 10 are located downstream of the flange 2 so that the valve housing 1 does not mar the line of the vehicle.

## Claims
CLAIM Filling valve on a vehicle for filling a fuel tank with fuel at excess pressure, said valve comprising a valve housing with non return valve , a fitting part situated upstream of the valve in the direction of flow and having coupling elements for a connectable filling line, elements located past the valve for connecting the line to the fuel tank of the vehicle, and means for attaching the valve housing to the vehicle, characterised in that the said means are formed by a flat flange and the fitting part extends fully downstream from the outside face of the flange

## Description
LPG filling valve for a vehicleThe invention relates to a filling valve on a vehicle, for filling a fuel tank with fuel at excess pressure, said valve comprising a valve housing with non return valve, a fitting part situated upstream of the valve in the direction of flow and having coupling elements for a connectable filling line, elements located past the valve for connecting the line to the fuel tank of the vehicle, and leans for attaching the valve housing to the vehicle.Such a valve is generally known. In the known valve, the fitting part with its closure projects outwards far beyond the fagtenimg elements, which leans that the positioning of the fIiii valve has already been a problem for many decodes, because the outside of the vehicle is marred by it and only a limitad number of areas of the vehicle are suitable for the posttioning The object of the invention is to find a simple solution to the problem here.This object is achieved according to the invention by the abovementioned elements being formed by a flat flange, and by the fitting part extending fully downstream from the outside face of the flange.By the extremely simple measure according to the invention, one obtains a valve housing whose fastening flange forms the outermost part, while all other parts are located further downstream, which after assembly means further inwards.When placed in an opening of a part of the vehicle, such as a side panel of a body, the flange can now be positioned in such a way that the maximum part projecting outwards is determined by the thickness of the flange.The term flange is understood to mean an ordinary square or rectangular flange with holes for fixing bolts, but it can also be a square or annular flange which is secured against turning in the body opening by a boss or the like and is attached by a ring or clamping elements fitted against the rear wall of the body plate.Using this last mentioned element produces a practically flush filling valve assembly, i.e. it hardly projects at all beyond the surface of the body.The number of positioning possibilities is thereby greatly extended, and the purchase of a liquid gas or LPG installation is made less unattractive, because the now stipulated external placing of the filling valve does not mar the line of the body, and the filling valve according to the invention also permits positionings where the filling valve cannot be seen at all, for example behind a hingeably attached number plate.If it is fastened with a clamping ring lying against the inside of the body panel, one cannot even see any bolt heads. If, however, bolts are used for fastening of the flange, they can, of course, have a countersunk head.The protection of the fitting against dust can consist of a simple cap, which is clamped in or screwed into the fitting opening.The invention will now be explained in greater detail with reference to the drawing, which shows an embodiment of the invention in cross section. The drawing shows a housing 1 with flange 2, a. screw thread part 3 which follows the flange and forms the fitting to which is connected the filling line of the filling station, for example anLPG filling line, or which has screwed into it an adapter if the filling line of the filling station does not fit.Instead of the screw thread fitting 3, one can also have other connection elements, such as a bayonet connection.The screw thread fitting 3 is downstream of the flange 2.Following the fitting part is a second screw thread part 4, into which is screwed the valve housing 5 to take the valve 6, which is held in the closed position by a helical spring 7, which rests in the narrow part 8. The valve housing has a groove 9 to take an 0 ring 10, and a groove 11 for tightening with a screwdriver.The 0 ring 10 works in conjunction with the convex top face 13 of the valve, which with legs 14 is guided on the wall 15 of the valve housing and can find a stop on the bottom face 12 of the valve seat.The housing has a square flanged part 16 with external screw thread 17 for connection of the line or hose going to the tank.This part 16 need not, of course, stand at right angles to the main part of the housing 1, but can also be in line with it.Shown above the flange 2 is a cap 18 with a screw thread part 19 which fits into the fitting 3, and a rim 20 which is shaped in such a way that the cap 18 is easily screwed on and off. The flange 2 can be provided with four bolt holes, one of which is schematically indicated by the centre line 21, said bolt holes being positioned in the known manner in the corners of a square flange. The housing part 22 can, however, also be positioned in a hole in the body wall in such a way that it cannot turn, for example with a projecting boss, and on the outside 22 of the housing 1 a ring can then be clamped, for example with a screw thread.Bolts and bolt holes are not needed then. The flange can be smaller and, for example, circular. The flange can also be thinner. This design is suitable for positioning where the rear side of the body panel or vehicle part is readily accessible, for example the rear panel of the boot of a vehicle.
