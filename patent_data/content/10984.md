# LAYERED MEMBRANE ASSEMBLY AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PROCESSES AND ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL UTILIZING SAME

## Abstract
The invention relates to a membrane assembly and processes for the utilization of the membrane assembly, or membrane assemblies having like properties. The mem brane assembly 10 comprises intermixed layers of capillary material 11 and high dielectric constant impermeable ma terial 13 , forming capillary channels parallel to the direc tion of ion transport through the membrane. The membrane is anion permeable, does not have membrane potential and will not foul even over extended operation, allows cross flow of anions and cations, and is highly efficient. It is possible to remove complex metals from any contaminated acid by elec trodialysis, such as removing vanadium and uranium in re coverable form from contaminated phosphoric acid, while producing food grade phosphoric acid in the process. Addi tionally, simple metals may be removed from mine waste li quids from leaching , chlorine can be produced from a chloride containing salt, and chromium can be removed from chromium contaminated water by electrolysis. Milling sludge can be treated to form water, caustic, and acid, and mineral ized water can be treated to form de mineralized water, by subjecting the feed liquids to electrodialysis.
