# Method and apparatus for operating a boom.

## Abstract
A method of operating a boom 10 which comprises an elongate member 11 mounted on a base 12 for pivotal movement about a first axis 13 transverse to the axis of the elongate member 11 , first fluid operated power means 20 mounted between the base 12 and the elongate member 11 to control raising and lowering of the member 11 about the first axis 13 , an implement 15 mounted at one end of the member 11 for pivotal movement about a second axis 18 transverse to the axis of the elongate member 11 , second fluid operated power means 24 comprising a double acting ram having a cylinder 25 and plunger 26 slidable therein, mounted between the implement 15 and the member 11 to control movement of the implement 15 about the second axis 18 , means to feed fluid under pressure to and from the first fluid operated power means 20 along first feed lines 27a, 27b via a first operating valve 28 , means to feed fluid under pressure to and from the second fluid operated power means 24 along second feed lines 21a, 21b via a second operating valve 32 , a displacement means 35 comprising a further double acting fluid operated ram connected between the member 11 and the base 12 to sense movement of the member 11 about the first axis 13 , fluid lines 39a, 39b from the displacement means 35 to the second fluid operated power means 24 to transmit a signal to the second fluid operated power means 24 to cause the second fluid operated power means 24 to operate to maintain the orientation of the implement 15 relative to the base 12 as the implement 15 is raised and lowered on the member 11 , the method including the steps of providing fluid under pressure to the displacement means 35 during raising of said one end of the elongate member 11 , whereby said displacement means 35 contributes to the raising of said one end of the member 11 .
