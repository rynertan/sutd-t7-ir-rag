# APPARATUS FOR THE EVALUATION OF PARTICULATE MATERIAL

## Abstract
An apparatus and process for evaluating particulate ma terial in elongate form. The apparatus comprises feeder means 1 for receiving a sample removed from a mass of the material and for feeding the material to an outlet at a substantially constant rate of flow a classifier 3 for receiv ing said material from the outlet of said feeder, said classifier having a first sieve tray 21 having holes which retain a first fraction having lengths exceeding 5 mm and pass a second fraction of lengths between 1 5 mm a second sieve tray 22 having holes which pass a second fraction of particles of 1 mm in length or less and retaining particles greater than 1 mm in length or less and retaining particles greater than 1 mm in length up to about 5 mm in length a third tray 23 which is imperforate for receiving the second fraction a se ries of bins 6a 6c located in relation to the outlet ends of the trays to receive the three fractions controllable drive means 64, 65 for said bins for independant tipping thereof of discharge the material at a desired rate a vibratory optical viewing table 95 sampling means in the form of a recep tacle 75 which is capable of reciprocating at least into and out of the region beneath the bin containing the second frac tion, and of tipping the contents of the receptacle onto said optical viewing table electro optical scanning meanss 10 for scanning the sample on substantial separation after a predetermined vibration period and microprocessor to proc ess the electrical signals from said scanning means to obtain values representing at least length and width of strand.
