## Abstract
In order to provide a passive electro optical display medium in a matrix display device with a sufficiently steep threshold with respect to the applied voltage and with a memory, a switching element 9 is placed in series with each picture element. The switching element 9 is provided between a picture electrode 6 of each picture element and a driving electrode 8 . The switch ing element 9 is formed by a polysilicon island 20 in which n doped regions 22, 23 are provided which are separated by a p doped region 21 . As a result of this, two series arranged, oppositely directed p n junc tions are formed of which always one is reversely bi ased. The width of the p doped regions is so small that punch through occurs between the two p n junctions before one of the p n junctions breaks down. Due to the occurrence of punch through, the series resistance of the switching element is negligibly small so that a favourable Ron Roff ratio is obtained and the picture elements can be driven with comparatively low voltages.
