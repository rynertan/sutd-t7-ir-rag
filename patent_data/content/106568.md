# Sheet feeding apparatus.

## Abstract
A sheet feeding apparatus for a copying machine includes two sheet trays 1, 2 and a frictional feeding device 3 in a fixed location for topfeeding sheets from either one of the stacks. The trays are carried one above another by a tray carriage and are arranged for independent slideable with drawal from the tray carriage towards the front of the machine. The tray carriage is mounted for vertical move ments, and the upper tray is slideably mounted on a sub frame for movements thereover in the sheet feed direction, i.e. across the machine, so that the top sheet in either one of the two trays may be brought into feeding engagement with the feeder device.
