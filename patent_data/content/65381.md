## Description
STRIPPING AGENTS The present invention relates to stripping agents, especially useful in the removal of paint and agents incorporating one or more dyes. The occurrence of graffiti, and other undesirable written material is a widespread social problem and the wide variety of materials which can be used to deface buildings, signs and other public utilities has caused a substantial problem in the removal of such. Also, with a wide variety of writing and or marking implements available to the public generally, there is the problem of removal of such when they are applied indiscriminately, for example when placed in the hands of children. It is an object of the present invention to provide multi purpose compositions which can be used to substantially remove a wide variety of paint and or dye based marks from a number of materials. Another object of a preferred embodiment of the present invention is to provide such compositions having a substantially nil flashpoint closed cup flashpoint test . The closest art of which the applicant is aware isGerman Patent No. 2927968 in the name of Tegee ChemieTietjen Gehrke which discloses a combination of a chlorinated hydrocarbon, for example methylene chloride, an aromatic hydrocarbon, for example toluene, a ketone, for example cyclohexone, a lower alcohol, for example methanol, a higher alcohol, for example benzyl alcohol, a swelling agent, such as carboxymethylcellulose, a wetting agent, and an alkaline solution. A major proportion of the solution is the chlorinated hydrocarbon. U.K.Patent No. 1 487 737 in the name of National Research Development Corporation discloses a paint removing composition or aerosol type paint in the form of a gel which comprises as active ingredients an organic solvent comprising one or more compounds containing an ester functional group, such as ethyl acetate, iso n propylacetate, iso n butylacetate or amylacetate, and one or more compounds containing both an ether and an alcohol functional group such as 2 2 butoxyethoxy ethylacetate, together with a gelling agent having both water and organic solvent solubility such as hydroxypropylcellulose, and a surface active agent which aids the formation of an oil in water emulsion, particularly cationic and non ionic surfactants, e.g. Triton 100. French Patent 2390484 in the name of Lerner Otto Serfac discloses removal compositions which contain methylene chloride and methanol and which may also contain methylhydroxypropylcellulose, and or an emulsifier such as sodium lauryl sulfate. German Patent No. 1276849 discloses solutions containing methylene chloride, methanol, methylbenzylalcohol, methylbenzyl alcohol, ethylbenzene, 1,2,dichloroethylene, thiourea, paraffin, methylcellulose and water. United States Patent No. 2,495,729 discloses a cleaning method utilising compositions containing cellulose acetate in acetone, paraffin wax, carbon tetrachloride, ethylenedichloride, propyl butyl alcohol, and ethyl acetate. Much of the art is summarised by Joseph Mazia in two articles in Mental Finishing, July 1979 and August 1979 at pages 57 to 61 and 39 to 43, respectively. None of the above references disclose compositions which have the particular combination of components in selected amounts are described herein and which show the remarkable removal properties exhibited by the compositions. The present inventor has developed formulations which exhibit unexpectedly superior results to known paint stripping compositions. The particular combination of components in the selected amounts exhibit surprisingly effective broad spectrum results in the removal of the common forms of graffiti. Although the compositions have been broadly described in so far as the amounts of components within the formulation, it has been generally found that only selected combinations of the amounts of the components will yield clear, homogenous solutions which exhibit superior stripping or removal properties. It was found that a combination of an ether such as ethylene glycol monoethyl or monoethyl ether, and a substituted hydrocarbon solvent, in particular xylene, together with certain solvents such as distillate and or ethyl, isobutyl or butyl acetate exhibited a possible synergism in the removal of paint and or dye based marks.However the flashpoint of such a composition was unsatisfactory. Also, although the composition did yield satisfactory results the broad spectrum results which are achieved by the compositions as hereinafter described were not evident. Although various multipurpose compositions fall within the scope of the present invention which yield results in the removal of a broad spectrum of paint and or dye based marks, generally, it has been found that a composition suitable for spray paint removal will have a different formulation to a remover suitable for the removal of spirit dyes and the like, such as pentel pen and textacolour. In one form of the present invention there is provided a composition comprising i. from 0 to 30 by volume of an ester of aC1 C6 alcohol with a C1 C6 acid, preferably butyl acetate or ethyl acetate ii. from 5 to 40 by volume of an ether, preferably ethylene glycol monoethyl ether or ethylene glycol monomethyl ether such as those marketed under the trade name of Oxitol Shell Australia or Cellosolve iii. from 0 to 10 by volume of a cresol cresylic acid iv. from 2 to 20 by volume of a petroleum solvent such as distillate Mobil Australia No. 2 HeatingOil and or kerosene v. from 10 to 40 by volume of an halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, preferably a chlorinated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or trichloroethane vi. from 0 to 15 by volume of a naphtha, preferably mineral turpentine or the like vii. from 2 to 20 by volume of a substituted or unsubstituted benzene solvent, preferably a dialkyl substituted benzene, preferably xylene such as that marketed under the trade name of Xylol Shell Australia viii. from 0 to 5 by volume of a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid, preferably oleic acid ix. from 0 to 15 by volume of an aromatic petroleum oil, such as that marketed under the trade name ofCertrex 47 Mobil Australia and x. from 0 to 20 by volume of a ketone or aldehyde solvent such as methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone or methyl ethyl ketone xi. a variable amount of an alkali such as sodium and or potassium hydroxide solution, depending on the solubility of the solute in the composition.Preferably from 0.5 to 6 by volume of potassium hydroxide and or sodium hydroxide 50 solution is used xii. from 0 to 5 by volume of wood oil such as pine oil, xiii. up to about 3 of a nonionic surfactant such as Nonidet P 40 xiv. from 0 to 10 , preferably 4 to 8 by volume of an halogenated benzene solvent such as orthodichlorbenzene xv. from 0 to 10 by volume of a C1 C6 alcohol. It has been found that components of the above composition can be varied in the given ranges for particular applications. In a preferred form of the invention there is provided a composition which is suitable to remove paints, and particularly dye based materials such as texta colour and ink and other stains from a variety of surfaces. It is not recommended for use on water based paint surfaces. In accordance with this embodiment of the invention there is provided a composition comprising i. from 10 to 25 by volume, preferably about 15 , of an ester of a C1 C6 alcohol with a C1 C6 acid preferably butyl acetate or ethyl acetate ii. from 1 to 5 by volume of a cresol or cresylic acid, preferably about 2 to 38 iii. from 0 to 20E, preferably about 6 to 12 , by volume of a petroleum solvent, preferably distillate No. 2Heating Oil and or kerosene, preferably distillate and kerosene in a ratio of about 1 1 iv. from 5 to 15 , preferably about 10 , by volume of an ether, preferably ethylene glycol monomethyl ether v. from 2 to 20 , preferably about 8 , by volume of a substituted benzene, preferably a dialkyl substituted benzene such as xylene vi. from 2 to 20 , preferably about 5 to 15 by volume of a naphtha preferably mineral turpentine or its equivalent vii. from 0 to 10 , preferably about 5 , by volume of methyl isobutylketone or methyl ethyl ketone viii. from 0 to 3 , preferably about 1 to 2 , by volume of a surfactant, preferably nonionic such as that marketed under the trade name Nonidet P 40 ix. from 0.5 to 5 , preferably about 1 , by volume of a saturated or unsaturated fatty acid, preferably oleic acid x. from 2 to 15 , preferably about 2 to 6 by volume of a substantially aromatic solvent at least about 60 aromatic content such as an aromatic petroleum oil such as that marketed under the trade name of Certrex 47 and xi. from 3 to 10 , preferably about 6 of an halogenated benzene, preferably orthodichlorbenzene ODCB xii. from 10 to 40 , preferably about 15 to 30 , by volume of a halogenated hydrocarbon, preferably chlorinated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride or trichloroethane 1, 1, 1 , preferably a combination of trichloroethane and methylene chloride, more preferably in a weight ratio of about 2 1 respectively and xiii. from 0 to 3 by volume of pine oil xiv. from 0 to 108 by volume of C1 C6 alcohol such as methanol and or ethanol xv. a variable amount of an alkali such as potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide depending on the solubility of the solute in the composition. Preferably about 1 to 28 by volume of a 50 solution of KOH is used. Another preferred form of the invention proviaes a composition which is especially useful in the removal of spray paint. This composition does not provide the broad spectrum results of the above described embodiment but is a useful alternative to remove the most prevalent from of graffiti applied by means of spray paint.In this embodiment there is provided a composition comprising i. from 20 to 50 , preferably about 36 to 40 , by volume of an ether, preferably ethylene glycol monoethyl ether or ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ii. from 2 to 10 , preferably about 3 to 6 , by volume of a naphtha such as mineral turpentine iii. from 2 to 20 , preferably about 5 to 7 , by volume of a substituted benzene preferably a aisubstituted benzene such as xylene iv. from 0 to 20 , preferably about 6 , by vplume of a ketone solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone v. from 0 to 5 , preferably about 1.5t, by volume of a surfactant, preferably nonionic, such as NonidetP 40 vi. from 0 to 5 , preferably up to about 2 , by volume of an unsaturated or saturated fatty acid preferably an oleic acid vii. from 0 to 10 , preferably up to about 3 , by volume of a cresol or cresylic acid viii. from 2 to 10 , preferably about 2 to 6 , by volume of an aromatic petroleum oil such as that marketed under the trade name of Certrex 47 ix. from 2 to 10 , preferably about 2 to 6 , by volume of a petroleum solvent such as distillate No. 2Heating Oil x. from 10 to 30 , preferably about 16 , by volume of a chlorinated hydrocarbon, preferably methylene chloride and or trichloroethane, and preferably in a ratio of methylene chloride to trichloroethane of from 3 1 to 1 2, preferably about 1.5 1 xi. from 0 to 10 , preferably about 5 by volume of a C1 C6 alcohol for example methanol and or ethanol xii. up to about 3 by volume of pine oil, preferably about 1 to 2 and xiii. a variable amount of an alkali such as a solution of potassium and or sodium hydroxide, preferably from 1 to 10 , preferably about 6 to 9 by volume of a 50 solution.

EXAMPLE 7 The solution below gave broad spectrum results in the removal of a number of dye and or paint based marks from various substrates such as bricks, tiles, concrete, etc.The solution is not recommended for water based paint substrates. Oxitol 10 Butyl Acetate 20 Mineral Turps wood distilled 5 turpentine Xylene 88 Ortho Di Chlor Benzene 6 Oleic Acid 1 Cresylic Acid 3 Certrex 47 5 Distillate 4.5 Chlorothene 20 Kerosene 5 Nonidet P 40 1 Methylene Chloride 10 Potassium Hydroxide 50 solution 1.5 The above proportions are specified on a volume basis. EXAMPLE 6 The following solution was prepared and was found to be extremely successful in the removal of spray paint from concrete bricks and tiles, and the like. Oxitol 385 ml Methylisobutylketone 60 ml Xylene 50 ml Mineral Turps wood distilled 60 ml turpentine Certrex 47 60 ml Distillate liy.2 Heating Oil 60 ml Nonidet P 40 15 ml Chlorothene 100 ml Methylene Chloride 150 ml Potassium Hydroxide 50 solution 30 ml Sodium Hyaroxide 50 solution 30 ml 1000 ml It should be understood that the above solutions should result in substantially clear homogenous solution.Accordingly, the mixing procedure is important to ensure that such a solution will result. The mixing procedure for the above four examples is substantially similar to the mixing procedure for Examples 4, 5 and 6. Examples 1,2 and 7,8 exhibited substantially nil flash points which is desirable for solutions of this kind. It will be clear to the skilled person in the art that various equivalents of the compounds referred to herein may be used without departing from the broad scope of the present invention. For example, turpentine is a mixture of a number of solvents resulting from the distillation of crude oil or wood. Mineral turpentine has a boiling range of 150 to 2000C and comprises about 40 by weight of paraffinic hydrocarbons, about 12 by weight of naphthenic hydrocarbons and about 40 by weight of aromatic hydrocarbons. Therefore, it is possible to use analogous solvents to obtain the same solubility and boiling range of mineral turpentine. It has been found that mineral turpentine and wood distilled turpentine exhibit substantially analogous properties within the compositions of the present invention. In another example, distillate is another distillation product and may be replaced by No.2 heating oil. The surfactant Nonidet P 40 has been found particularly suitable in the process of the present invention but other nonionic surfactants may also be substituted. Various amides of fatty acids, polyethylene oxide condensates of alcohol phenyls, esters from the reaction of fatty acids with polyhydric alcohols, condensation products of aliphatic alcohol with ethylene oxide, etc. may all be suitable as surfactants in the composition of the present invention. The aromatic solvent such as Certrex 47 may be replaced by various aromatic solvents having at least a 608 aromatics content. It should also be undertood that the compositions of the present invention may have foaming agents or gelling agents added thereto which are compatible with the composition for ease of application. The above examples give solutions which are suitable for spraying or painting on the marked area and are generally washed or sponged off depending on the circumstances. Gelling or foaming of the solutions may provide a more controlled means of applying the compositions.
