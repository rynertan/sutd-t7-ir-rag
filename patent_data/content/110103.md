# Method of making complementary transistor metal oxide semiconductor structures.

## Abstract
A process is provided which forms a bulk CMOS struc ture by initially depositing an oxidation barrier layer 38 on an N type semiconductor substrate 12 , which is finally used as gate dielectric, forming a P well 22 in the substrate 12 through a given segment of the barrier layer 38 , removing a first segment of the barrier layer to form N regions 26, 28 for N channel source and drain, removing a second segment of the barrier layer 38 to form a P field region 51, 48 , removing a third segment of the barrier layer 38 to form P regions 60, 62 for source and drain of a P channel device, forming a first control electrode 68 having a given work function for the P channel device which acts as an ion barrier and then forming a second control elec trode 70 between the N channel source and drain regions having a work function different from that of the first control electrode.
