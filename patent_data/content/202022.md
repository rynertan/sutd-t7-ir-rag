## Description
The invention relates to the field of liquid handling. More specifically, the invention relates to dispensing devices which dispense sample liquid from a magazine which is inserted into the device and which include a hydraulic pump for collapsing the inserted magazine and dispensing sample liquid therefrom. For many liquid handling applications both quantitative accuracy and cleanliness are required. The invention is a hydraulic dispenser which includes and combines the means to impart both quantitative accuracy and cleanliness. Quantitative accuracy is provided by the use of a hydraulic press and a hydraulic pump cleanliness is provided by the use of an insertable magazine for containing the sample liquid. During operation, the insertable magazine is attached to and hydraulically coupled to the hydraulic press. The hydraulic pump within the hydraulic press acts on the coupled magazine in order to dispense sample liquid by means of quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. The hydraulic press houses hydraulic liquid and includes the means to generate both quantitative positive displacements and reflux displacements of the enclosed hydraulic liquid. The hydraulic press includes a hydraulic pump and a magazine coupler hydraulically connected to one an other. When the insertable magazine and the magazine coupler are connected, the magazine coupler relays hydraulic displacements from the hydraulic pump to the magazine. Hydraulic displacements generated by the pump are relayed through the coupler to the magazine to cause the magazine to expand or to collapse. The magazine can be loaded with sample liquid either prior to insertion or after insertion. Reflux displacements generated by the pump cause an inserted magazine to expand and thereby to aspirate sample liquid positive displacements generated by the pump cause the magazine to collapse and thereby to express sample liquid. The insertion and connection of a preloaded magazine without entrapped air establishes immediate hydraulic contact with the pump. If a magazine is loaded after insertion, hydraulic contact is established after the entrapped air is purged. The accuracy of dispensing for this invention depends on the accuracy of the quantitative positive displacements generated by the hydraulic pump and upon the establishment of hydraulic contact between the hydraulic pump and the sample liquid contained within the magazine. The accuracy of dispensing for this invention does not depend upon the accuracy of the reflux displacements. Dispensers utilizing a hydraulic pump hydraulically coupled to a supply chamber for dispensing liquid from the supply chamber are known. Examples of the use of a hydraulic pump for dispensing liquids are illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 3,572,552 Guinn and U.S. Patent No. 4,158,035 Haase . In each of these devices, the supply chamber is an integral and permanent part of the device. Neither of these devices includes the means to couple to an insertable magazine. Although these devices teach how to establish hydraulic contact between the pump and the diaphragm of the supply chamber, the devices do not teach how to establish hydraulic contact between the pump and the sample liquid enclosed by the supply chamber. The accuracy of these devices depends upon the accuracy of both the reflux displacement and the positive displacement, neither of which is hydraulically coupled to the sample liquid. These devices are not capable of positive hydraulic displacement of the sample liquid. Positive displacement and reflux displacement should be distinguished. A positive displacement results from the assertion of an affirmative force. If the force underlying a positive displacement is sufficient, it will overwhelm any resistive properties of the sample liquid such as viscosity, surface tension, density, and vapor pressure and any extrinsic forces such as atmospheric pressure or gravity. A reflux displacement results from the force of atmospheric pressure when a pre existing restraining force is removed. The accuracy of a reflux displacement is limited by the presence of resistive forces which may exceed the forces due to atmospheric pressure. Positive hydraulic displacement should be distinguished from positive displacement. A positive hydraulic displacement results from the action of a positive force upon a train of mechanical parts and incompressible liquids contained in a rigid container. An initial positive force applied at one end is undissipated by the train. The train is not hydraulic if it includes a compressible component. When a positive force is applied at one end of a compressible train, the train will compress until its compression pressure matches the sum of all opposing resistive pressures. The effect is to dissipate the initial applied force. The displacement force at the far end of a compressible train is less than the initial applied force. Because the Guinn and Haase devices each allow air to be entrapped within their supply chambers, these devices can not be considered to be positive hydraulic displacement devices. All air must be purged from a hydraulic system for the system to be incompressible. Neither the Guinn device nor the Haase device illustrates how to establish hydraulic contact between the pump and the sample liquid. An example of a device utilizing positive hydraulic displacement is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 2,529,937 Hale . The Hale device hydraulically couples a displacement liquid with the sample liquid for controlling and metering the flow rate of the sample liquid. The Hale device does not include means for dispensing individual aliquots of the sample liquid or for aspirating sample liquid into the sample chamber. The Hale device does not include a pump or its equivalent which can generate quantitative displacements of the hydraulic liquid. The Hale device is useful for the continuous application of sample liquid at a measured flow rate. An example of an other device utilizing positive hydraulic displacement is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 3,121,614 Galster . The Galster device is a titration device which dispenses serial aliquots of identical volumes of standard solution into a test solution. The Galster patent illustrates how to hydraulically couple a pressure liquid with a titrating liquid for dispensing the titrating liquid. However, the Galster patent does not teach the concept of positive hydraulic displacement. Also, the Galster device does not include means to couple an insertable magazine to the pump. The sample chamber of the Galster device must be cleaned by flushing between uses of different titrating liquids. Dispensers which utilize disposable magazines are known and widely used. The use of a disposable magazine improves the cleanliness and convenience of liquid handling. Disposable magazines are particularly useful for handling corrosive, radio active, and other toxic liquids. An example of a dispensing device which combines the use of an insertable magazine with a hydraulic pump is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 3,736,099 Begg . The Begg device is a convenient dispensing device because it combines some of the advantages of a hydraulic pump with the convenience of the insertable magazine. However, the Begg device does not include the means to establish hydraulic contact between the pump and the sample liquid. The Begg patent does not teach how to purge entrapped air from the inserted magazine the Begg device does not teach how to insert and to connect a preloaded magazine to the dispensing device. The invention is a hydraulic dispenser and a method for dispensing sample liquids. The hydraulic dispenser is a hydraulic press which includes a hydraulic pump and a magazine coupler hydraulically connected to each other. The hydraulic pump houses hydraulic liquid and generates quantitative positive displacements of the hydraulic liquid contained therein. The magazine coupler includes means to couple to an insertable magazine. The insertable magazine can be inserted or removed from the magazine coupler of the hydraulic dispenser. The magazine includes an enclosure which serves as a store for the sample liquid. A tubular spout communicating to the enclosure serves as a guide for transferring sample liquid to and from the magazine. The magazine coupler includes means to hydraulically couple to the magazine when it is inserted. The purpose of the magazine coupler is to relay hydraulic displacements between the hydraulic pump and the insertable magazine. When hydraulic contact is established between the hydraulic pump and the sample liquid enclosed within the magazine, the hydraulic dispenser dispenses sample liquid by positive hydraulic displacement. The hydraulic pump is hydraulically connected to the magazine coupler with hydraulic liquid. The hydraulic pump can generate either positive or reflux displacements of the enclosed hydraulic liquid. Also, the hydraulic pump can generate quantitative positive hydraulic displacements. The magazine coupler includes means to receive the hydraulic displacements from the pump and to relay these displacements to the inserted magazine. The hydraulic pump can be controlled by the user to generate, meter, and transmit a range of quantitative displacements of hydraulic liquid. To use the hydraulic dispenser, the magazine is inserted into the hydraulic dispenser and connected to the magazine coupler. The magazine enclosure can expand or collapse in response to displacements generated by the pump and relayed by the magazine coupler. Expanding the magazine enclosure causes sample liquid to aspirate into the enclosure through the tubular spout collapsing the magazine enclosure causes the content of the enclosure to express through the tubular spout. Loading the magazine with sample liquid and eliminating the enclosed air establishes hydraulic content between the pump and the sample liquid in the enclosure. Once hydraulic contact is established, the hydraulic dispenser can express sample liquid from the magazine by quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. In order to establish hydraulic contact between the sample liquid and the hydraulic pump, all entrapped air must be eliminated from the system. Hydraulic contact may be established by inserting a magazine which is loaded with sample liquid and purged of entrapped air prior to insertion. If the magazine is loaded and purged prior to insertion, the spout of the magazine should be stoppered until the hydraulic connection is established. Alternatively, hydraulic contact may be established after inserting an unloaded magazine. If the magazine is loaded and purged after insertion, the eliminating of entrapped air from the magazine establishes hydraulic contact. A purgable magazine is used to facilitate the elimination of entrapped air. A purgable magazine includes an enclosure for containing sample liquid with a spout which exits from the topmost part of the enclosure. Entrapped air floats to the top most part of the enclosure when the dispenser is held in its normally upright position. When the purgable magazine is collapsed, the entrapped air will vent from the magazine prior to the expression of sample liquid. The expression of a stream of sample liquid from the magazine assures that the purging of entrapped air is complete. The magazine may be a disposable. The dispenser is configured to facilitate the insertion and removal of the magazine and its connection to and disconnection from the coupler. The magazine coupler includes several species. The preferred embodiment of each of three species is described. Each species is optimal for a different application. The three species include an immersion coupler, a diaphragmatic coupler, and a mechanical coupler. The immersion coupler couples with its magazine by immersing the magazine in hydraulic liquid within a hydraulic chamber. The hydraulic chamber is a rigid chamber for enclosing both the hydraulic liquid and the insertable magazine. The insertable magazine which couples with the immersion coupler is a bag magazine. The bag magazine includes a flexible bag structure which can be inserted and enclosed within the rigid chamber. The flexible bag structure encloses the sample liquid. The flexible bag structure is immersed in the hydraulic liquid after it is inserted into the rigid chamber. The diaphragmatic coupler is similar to the immersion coupler, except that a diaphragm partitions the rigid chamber to form a hydraulic compartment for containing the hydraulic liquid. The diaphragm partitions the hydraulic fluid from the magazine. The rigid chamber encloses both the hydraulic compartment containing the hydraulic liquid and the magazine containing the sample liquid. The magazine which couples with the diaphragmatic coupler is a envelope magazine. The envelope magazine includes a flexible envelope structure which conforms with the shape of the diaphragm. Hydraulic displacements are transmitted from the hydraulic compartment to the flexible envelope structure within the rigid chamber. The mechanical coupler includes a coupler piston and coupler cylinder which define a chamber for enclosing the hydraulic liquid. The magazine which couples to the mechancial coupler is a mechanical magazine. The mechanical magazine includes a magazine piston and a magazine cylinder which define an enclosure for containing the sample liquid. When the mechanical magazine is inserted, the coupler piston is mechanically coupled to the magazine piston and the coupler cylinder and the magazine cylinder are each held by the housing in fixed relative positions. Hydraulic displacements are mechanically coupled through the pistons from the hydraulic pump to the sample liquid. It is a purpose of this invention to dispense sample liquid from a magazine by means of quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. It is a purpose of this invention to dispense sample liquid from a disposable magazine by means of quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. It is a purpose of this invention to dispense sample liquid from a purgable magazine by means of quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. It is a purpose of this invention to dispense sample liquid by means of quantitative positive hydraulic displacement from a magazine which can be easily inserted and removed from the dispenser. It is a purpose of this invention to dispense sample liquid from a magazine by means of quantitative positive hydraulic displacement when the means for generating said quantitative positive hydraulic displacement is separated and remote from the magazine. It is a purpose of this invention to dispense sample liquid from a purgable magazine having an enclosure to hold the sample liquid with a tubular spout which communicates with the topmost part of the enclosure so that collapsing the enclosure causes entrapped air to be eliminated from the enclosure prior to the expression of sample liquid. A preferred embodiment of the hydraulic dispenser is shown in Figure 1. The hydraulic dispenser works on the principle of the hydraulic press. As a hydraulic press, the hydraulic dispenser includes a hydraulic pump 1 which is hydraulically connected to a magazine coupler. Figure 1 illustrates a schematic representation of the hydraulic pump 1 and a preferred embodiment of each of three species of the magazine coupler, viz. an immersion coupler 2 , a diaphragmatic coupler 3 , and a mechanical coupler 4 . A preferred embodiment for each type of magazine coupler is shown in the corresponding FIGURES. Each magazine coupler is shown in this preferred embodiment with a housing having a handle shape for manually directing the function of the hydraulic dispenser. The handle shape allows the user to hold the magazine coupler by hand while pipetting or drawing fluids. A hydraulic hose 5 connects the hydraulic pump 1 to one or more of the magazine couplers. Displacements of hydraulic liquid 6 are generated by the hydraulic pump 1 and communicate through the hydraulic hose 5 to the magazine couplers. The magazine couplers couple to magazines. The magazines include an enclosure for storing sample liquid 7 . The magazine couplers are actuated by the hydraulic displacements to dispense sample liquid 7 from the magazine. The magazines can be inserted into or removed from the magazine couplers. Figure 1 illustrates the magazine couplers in their open position for insertion or removal of the magazines. Each species of magazine coupler requires a corresponding species of magazine to be adapted to the coupler. A preferred embodiment of each of the three corresponding species of magazine is shown in Figure 1. A bag magazine 8 is used for the immersion coupler 2 an envelope magazine 9 is used for the diaphragmatic coupler 3 and a mechanical magazine 10 is used for the mechanical coupler 4 . The hydraulic pump 1 can generate both positive hydraulic displacements and reflux displacements. The positive hydraulic displacements force hydraulic liquid 6 through the hydraulic hose 5 and into the magazine coupler. The reflux displacements, draw hydraulic liquid 6 back through the hydraulic hose 5 from the magazine coupler into the hydraulic pump 1 . The hydraulic pump 1 can also generate quantitative positive hydraulic displacements for dispensing sample liquid 7 from the inserted magazines. The distance of separation between the magazine coupler and the hydraulic pump 1 is limited only by the length of the hydraulic hose 5 . The location of the hydraulic pump 1 which controls the magazine coupler can be removed from the location where the dispensing actually occurs. The separation of control location from work location can be important for hazardous procedures or sterile procedures which require that the sample liquids be isolated from the operator. The procedure for inserting or removing the bag magazine 8 into or from the immersion coupler 2 is shown in Figure 2. The immersion coupler 2 includes a rigid chamber 11 for containing both hydraulic liquid 6 and the bag magazine 8 . Before the port 12 of the rigid chamber 11 is opened, the hydraulic liquid 6 is removed from the rigid chamber 11 by refluxing to the hydraulic pump 1 or by discarding. After the port 12 is opened, the bag magazine 8 may be inserted or removed. The bag magazine 8 includes both a flexible bag structure 13 and a tubular spout 14 . The tubular spout 14 connects to the topmost part 15 of the flexible bag structure 13 . Like the hydraulic hose 5 , the tubular spout 14 is adapted to transmit positive hydraulic displacements. If the tubular spout 14 requires significant length and or flexibility, the tubular spout 14 may in fact include a section of hydraulic hose. If the tubular spout 14 does not require significant length and or flexibility, the tubular spout 14 may be made of a rigid or semi rigid material which renders the tubular spout 14 substantially inflexible. In any event, a given tubular spout 14 defines a hollow guide which must maintain a substantially constant carrying volume. To insert the bag magazine 8 into the rigid chamber 11 , the tip of the tubular spout 16 is passed through the port 12 and threaded through the exit 17 of the rigid chamber 11 . The passage of the tubular spout 14 through the exit 17 stoppers the exit 17 . The flexible bag strucutre 13 follows the tubular spout 14 through the port 12 and is inserted into the rigid chamber 11 . The sequential procedure for preparing the immersion coupler 2 for use is illustrated as a series in Figures 3 a , b , c , d , e , and f . The series in Figure 3 illustrates the flooding of the rigid chamber 11 with hydraulic liquid 6 the venting of entrapped air from the rigid chamber 11 the loading of the bag magazine 8 with sample liquid 7 the purging of entrapped air from the bag magazine 8 and the dispensing of sample liquid 7 . After the bag magazine 8 is inserted into the immersion coupler 2 , the port 12 is sealed closed and the rigid chamber 11 is flooded, as shown in Figure 3 a . During flooding, hydraulic liquid 6 fills the rigid chamber 11 by positive displacement generated by the hydraulic pump 1 . As hydraulic liquid 6 fills the chamber, entrapped air 18 escapes through the air vent 19 . Flooding is complete when the rigid chamber 11 is completely filled with hydraulic liquid 6 and substantially all entrapped air 18 has been eliminated through the air vent 19 . When flooding is complete, the air vent 19 is closed. Complete flooding and the elimination of substantially all entrapped air 18 from the rigid chamber 11 , as shown in Figure 3 b , establishes hydraulic contact between the hydraulic pump 1 and the flexible bag structure 13 of the bag magazine 8 . Once hydraulic contact is established with the bag magazine 8 , the bag magazine is loaded with sample liquid 7 . By refluxing hydraulic liquid 6 from the rigid chamber 11 , the flexible bag structure 13 will expand and will aspirate sample liquid 7 into its enclosure 20 . The reflux of hydraulic liquid 6 and the aspiration of sample liquid 7 are illustrated in Figure 3 c . After sample liquid 7 is aspirated into the enclosure 20 of the flexible bag structure 13 , entrapped air 21 is purged from the enclosure 20 . Purging substantially all of the entrapped air 21 establishes hydraulic contact between the hydraulic pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 contained within the enclosure 20 of the flexible bag structure 13 . Figure 3 d illustrates the purging of entrapped air 21 from the enclosure 20 of the flexible bag structure 13 . The flexible bag structure 13 is collapsed by positive displacement of hydraulic liquid 6 generated by the hydraulic pump 1 and passing into into the rigid chamber 11 . Because entrapped air 21 rises to the topmost part of the enclosure 15 and because the tubular spout 14 is connected to the topmost part of the enclosure 15 , entrapped air 21 expresses from the enclosure 20 through the tubular spout 14 as the flexible bag structure 13 collapses. In an alternative embodiment, the tubular spout 14 may be attached to the flexible bag structure 13 at locations other than the topmost part 15 . For example, if the tubular spout 14 is attached to the bottom most part of the flexible bag structure 13 , the user merely inverts the entire immersion coupler 2 in order to purge substantially all of the entrapped air 21 from the enclosure 20 . The expression of entrapped air 21 will precede the expression of sample liquid 7 . The expression of sample liquid 7 from the tubular spout 14 is a positive indication that the purging of entrapped air 21 from the enclosure 20 is substantially complete. Once substantially all of the entrapped air 21 has been eliminated from the enclosure 20 , hydraulic contact is established between the hydraulic pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 contained within the bag magazine 8 . After hydraulic contact is established between the pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 , the bag magazine 8 may be refilled by further aspiration of sample liquid 7 caused by further reflux of hydraulic liquid 6 back to the hydraulic pump 1 . Refilling the bag magazine 8 is illustrated in Figure 3 e . After the bag magazine 8 is filled with sample liquid 7 and hydraulic contact is established between the pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 , the immersion coupler 2 can relay a quantitative positive hydraulic displacement from the hydraulic pump 1 to the bag magazine 8 and to the sample liquid 7 enclosed therein, for expressing and dispensing sample liquid 7 through the tubular spout 14 by quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. The immersion coupler 2 is shown dispensing sample liquid 7 by quantitative positive hydraulic displacement in Figure 3 f . The diaphragmatic coupler 3 is shown in Figure 4 in the open position its corresponding insertable envelope magazine 9 is shown in Figure 5 and the diaphragmatic coupler 3 is shown in the closed position with an envelope magazine 9 inserted therein in Figure 6. The diaphragmatic coupler 3 includes a rigid chamber 22 which encloses both a hydraulic compartment 23 and the insertable envelope magazine 9 . The rigid chamber 22 includes a port 24 which may be opened to insert or remove the envelope magazine 9 . Figure 4 shows the port 24 in the open position for inserting the envelope magazine 9 . A diaphragm 25 partitions the rigid chamber to form the hydraulic compartment 23 for containing the hydraulic liquid 6 . The diaphragm 25 is shown in Figure 4 as a partial fragment in order to provide a view of the interior of the hydraulic compartment 23 . The hydraulic compartment 23 encloses hydraulic liquid 6 and is hydraulically connected to the hydraulic pump 1 . It is not necessary to reflux hydraulic liquid 6 from the rigid chamber 22 when changing the envelope magazine 9 . It is a purpose of the hydraulic compartment 23 to contain the hydraulic liquid 6 and to eliminate the need to open the system of hydraulic liquid 6 to air when inserting the magazine. The envelope magazine 9 is adapted for insertion into the diaphragmatic coupler 3 . The envelope magazine 9 includes a tubular spout 26 and a flexible envelope structure 27 having a topmost part 28 . The tubular spout 26 is connected to the topmost part 28 of the flexible envelope structure 27 . The tubular spout 26 has a substantially constant carrying volume, as with the tubular spout 14 for the immersion coupler 2 . To insert the envelope magazine 9 into the diaphragmatic coupler 3 , the port 24 of the rigid chamber 22 is opened, the flexible envelope structure 27 is laid over the diaphragm 25 , and the port 24 is closed over the envelope magazine 9 . In the closed position, the port 24 prevents air from entering the rigid chamber 22 . The shape of the envelope magazine 9 is configured to the shape of the diaphragm 25 . The tubular spout 26 of the envelope magazine 9 passes through the exit 29 in the rigid chamber 22 of the diaphragmatic coupler 3 . The passing of the tubular spout 26 of the envelope magazine 9 causes the exit 29 to be stoppered when the port 24 is closed so that air is prevented from entering the rigid chamber 22 of the diaphragmatic coupler 3 . In order to establish hydraulic contact between the hydraulic pump 1 and the flexible envelope, there must be an airless contact, or substantially airless contact, between the inserted envelope magazine 9 and the diaphragm 25 . The detail of an airless contact is shown in Figure 6. To achieve airless contact after the port 24 is closed, entrapped air is eliminated from the rigid chamber 22 and the interface between the diaphragm 25 and the flexible envelope structure 27 by the application of hydraulic pressure. Hydraulic pressure generated by the hydraulic pump 1 and applied to the hydraulic compartment 23 will force entrapped air from the rigid chamber 22 . The sequential procedure for preparing the diaphragmatic coupler 3 for use is illustrated as a series in Figures 7 a , b , c , d , and e . Figure 7 a illustrates the envelope magazine 9 enclosed in the rigid chamber 22 with the port 24 closed and the rigid chamber 22 purged of entrapped air. Hydraulic contact is established between the hydraulic pump 1 and the flexible envelope structure 27 supra . Once hydraulic contact is established, the hydraulic pump 1 refluxes hydraulic liquid 6 in order to partially evacuate hydraulic liquid 6 from the hydraulic compartment 23 . The reflux of the hydraulic liquid 6 causes the flexible envelope structure 27 to expand and to aspirate sample liquid 7 into the enclosure 30 of the envelope magazine 9 . The reflux of hydraulic liquid 6 and the aspiration of sample liquid 7 are illustrated in Figure 7 b . After sample liquid 7 is aspirated into the enclosure 30 of the flexible envelope structure, entrapped air 31 is purged from its enclosure 30 . Purging substantially all of the entrapped air 31 establishes hydraulic contact between the hydraulic pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 contained within the enclosure 30 of the flexible envelope structure 27 . Figure 7 c illustrates the purging of the enclosure 30 of the flexible envelope structure 27 . The flexible envelope structure 27 is collapsed by positive displacement of hydraulic liquid 6 generated by the hydraulic pump 1 and passing into the hydraulic compartment 23 within rigid chamber 22 . Because entrapped air 31 rises to the topmost part of the enclosure 28 and because the tubular spout 26 is connected to the topmost part of the enclosure 28 , entrapped air 31 expresses from the enclosure 30 through the tubular spout 26 as the flexible envelope structure 27 collapses. The expression of entrapped air 31 will precede the expression of sample liquid 7 . The expression of sample liquid 7 from the tubular spout 26 is a positive indication that the purging of entrapped air 31 from the enclosure 30 is substantially complete. Once entrapped air 31 has been substantially eliminated from the enclosure 30 , hydraulic contact is established between the hydraulic pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 contained within the envelope magazine 9 . After hydraulic contact is established between the pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 , the envelope magazine 9 may be refilled by further aspiration caused by further reflux of hydraulic liquid 6 from the hydraulic compartment 23 back to the hydraulic pump 1 . Refilling the envelope magazine 9 is illustrated in Figure 7 d . After the envelope magazine 9 is filled with sample liquid 7 and hydraulic contact is established between the pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 , the diaphragmatic coupler 3 can relay a quantitative positive hydraulic displacement from the hydraulic pump 1 to the envelope magazine 9 and to the sample liquid 7 enclosed therein for expressing sample liquid 7 and dispensing sample liquid 7 through the tubular spout 26 by quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. The diaphragmatic coupler 3 is shown dispensing sample liquid 7 by quantitative positive hydraulic displacement in Figure 7 e . A mechanical coupler 4 is shown in Figure 8 and its corresponding insertable mechanical magazine 10 is shown in Figure 9. The mechanical coupler 4 includes a coupler piston 32 and a coupler cylinder 33 within a housing 34 . The coupler piston 32 is slidable within the coupler cylinder 33 . The coupler piston 32 and coupler cylinder 33 define a chamber 35 which varies in size as the coupler piston 32 slides therein. The chamber 35 encloses hydraulic liquid 6 and is hydraulically connected to the hydraulic pump 1 . Figure 8 shows the coupler housing 34 and the top of the coupler piston 32 . Attached to the coupler housing 34 is a housing brace 36 and attached to the top of the coupler piston 32 is a piston brace 37 . Both the housing brace 36 and the piston brace 37 hold the mechanical magazine 10 in positon when it is inserted into the mechanical coupler 4 . The mechanical magazine 10 includes a magazine piston 38 and a magazine cylinder 39 . The magazine piston 38 is slidable within the magazine cylinder 39 . The magazine piston 38 and magazine cylinder 39 define an enclosure 40 which varies in volume as the magazine piston 38 slides therein. The magazine piston 38 can slide the entire length of the magazine cylinder 39 so as to reduce the volume of the enclosure 40 to nil. The enclosure 40 is configured so that the topmost part 41 is the last volume as the piston slides to reduce the volume to nil. The mechanical magazine 10 may also include a bellows 42 to shield the enclosure 40 against contamination. Attached to the magazine piston 38 is a piston brace receptor 43 and attached to the magazine cylinder 39 is a cylinder brace receptor 44 . When the mechanical magazine 10 is inserted into the mechanical coupler 4 , the piston brace receptor 43 is held by the piston brace 37 and the cylinder brace receptor 44 is held by the housing brace 36 . When the mechanical magazine 10 is inserted into the mechanical coupler 4 and the braces and receptors are connected, the magazine piston 38 and coupler piston 32 slide in concert within their respective cylinders while the magazine cylinder 39 and the coupler cylinder 33 are fixed in their relative positions with respect to the housing 34 . When the mechanical magazine 10 is inserted and connected hydraulic contact is established between the magazine piston 38 and the hydraulic pump 1 . The sequential procedure for preparing the mechanical coupler 4 for use is illustrated as a series in Figures 10 a , b , c , d , and e . Figure 10 a illustrates the attachment of the inserted mechanical magazine 10 within the mechanical coupler 4 . The magazine piston 38 is held to the coupler piston 32 by the attachment of the piston brace 37 to the piston brace receptor 43 . The piston attachment causes the magazine piston 38 and coupler piston 32 to slide identically and establishes hydraulic contact between the hydraulic pump 1 and the magazine piston 38 . The magazine cylinder 39 is held in a fixed relative position to the coupler cylinder 33 by the attachment of the housing brace 36 to the cylinder brace receptor 44 . The combination of the piston attachment and the cylinder attachment causes the volume of the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 to vary proportionally to the volume of the chamber 35 of the mechanical coupler 4 . Since the chamber 35 is hydraulically connected to the hydraulic pump 1 , positive displacements of hydraulic liquid 6 cause expansion of the chamber 35 and the collapse of the magazine enclosure 40 . Once hydraulic contact is established, the hydraulic pump 1 refluxes hydraulic liquid 6 in order to partially evacuate hydraulic liquid 6 from the chamber 35 of the mechanical coupler 4 . The reflux of the hydraulic liquid 6 causes the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 to expand and to aspirate sample liquid 7 into the enclosure 40 . The reflux of hydraulic liquid 6 and the aspiration of sample liquid 7 are illustrated in Figure 10 b . After sample liquid 7 is aspirated into the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 , entrapped air 45 is purged from its enclosure 40 . Purging substantially all of the entrapped air 45 establishes hydraulic contact between the hydraulic pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 contained within the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 . Figure 10 c illustrates the purging of entrapped air 45 from the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 . The enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 is collapsed by positive displacement of hydraulic liquid 6 generated by the hydraulic pump 1 and passing into the chamber 35 of the mechanical coupler 4 . Because entrapped air 45 rises to the topmost part of the enclosure 41 and because the tubular spout 46 is connected to the topmost part of the enclosure 41 , entrapped air 45 expresses from the enclosure 40 through the tubular spout 46 as the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 collapses. The expression of entrapped air 45 will precede the expression of sample liquid 7 . Because the tubular spout 46 has a substantially constant carrying volume, the expression of sample liquid 7 from the tubular spout 46 is a positive indication that the purging of entrapped air 45 from the enclosure 40 is substantially complete. Once substantially all of the entrapped air 45 has been eliminated from the enclosure 40 , hydraulic contact is established between the hydraulic pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 contained within the mechanical magazine 10 . After hydraulic contact is established between the pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 , the mechanical magazine 10 may be refilled by further aspiration caused by further reflux of hydraulic liquid 6 from the chamber 35 of the mechanical coupler 4 back to the hydraulic pump 1 . Refilling the mechanical magazine 10 is illustrated in Figure 10 d . After the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 is filled with sample liquid 7 and hydraulic contact is established between the pump 1 and the sample liquid 7 , the mechanical coupler 4 can relay a quantitative positive hydraulic displacement from the hydraulic pump 1 to the magazine piston 38 and to the sample liquid 7 enclosed within the enclosure 40 of the mechanical magazine 10 for expressing sample liquid 7 and dispensing sample liquid 7 through the tubular spout 46 by quantitative positive hydraulic displacement. The mechanical coupler 4 is shown dispensing sample liquid 7 by quantitative positive hydraulic displacement in Figure 10 e .
