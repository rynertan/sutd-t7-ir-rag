# A method for production of a silver halide photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A method for the production of a silver halide photo graphic light sensitive material comprising a support and coated thereon at least one layer of an emulsion containing light sensitive silver halide particles sensitized by a first sensitizing dye is described which comprises adding a solution of a second sensitizing dye to said emulsion, the silver halide particles of which have been sensitized by the first sensitizing dye, after the chemical ripening but prior to the coating, of said emulsion.
