## Description
New compound having antiinflammatory, analgesic and mucoregulating activity, process for its production and relative pharmaceutical compositionsIt is an object of the present invention 2 4isobutyl phenyl propionate of 2 methyl 5 1 hydroxy 1 methyl ethyl cyclohexen 2 yl having formula IEMI1.1 The therapeutic properties of 2 methyl 5 1 hydro xy 1methyl ethyl 2 cyclohexen 1 ol, or sobrerol II EMI1.2 are known since many ears. It has been used for the treatment of respiratory diseases V. Dalla Valle Boll. Chim. Farm., 109, 1970 , and more exactly as fluidifying agent brochosecrertago due and macouecretolytie activity in crues of neu te and chronic bronchitis with hypersecretive and obstructive component of the respiratory routes R.Scuri et awl., I1 Farmaco ed. Pr. i 1, 1980 . On the other side, the antiinflammatory properties of 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid Ibuprofen, see e.g. Adams et al., Pharmacodyn.Ther. 178, 115 1969 are also known.It has now unexpectedly found that the ester of the acid 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic with sobrerol, that is compound I, exhibits a broncho secretogogtie activity markedly higher than that of sobrerol, and it is besides characterized by antiinflammatory and analgesic properties, comparable and partially higher than that ofIbuprofen, showing contemporaneously a gastrolesivity clearly lower than that of the latter drug.Finally, compound I is also endowed with an appreciable anti cough effect.Thus, another object of the invention is provided by pharmaceutical compositions endowed with antiinflammatory, analgesic and mucoregolating and anticough activities, containing as active principle compound I .Finally, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of 2 4 isobutylphenyl pro pionate of 2 methyl S 1 hydroxy 1 methyl ethyl cyclohexen 2 yl,characterized by reacting the chloride of 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid III with sobrerol, according to the following scheme EMI3.1 The reaction is suitably carried out in aprotic solvents, for example in ethers such as diethyle ther, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and in presence of acidity acceptors. As such tertiary bases are preferably used, such as pyridine or triethylamine. One can operate at temperatures ranging from 0 and 800C, preferably from about 25 and 500C. The following example further illustrates, with out limiting it, the process according to the invention.EXAMPLETo 55 g of chloride of 2 4 isobutylphenyl propio nic acid and 20 ml of anhydrous pyridine 41.6 g of sobrerol dl transform dissolved in 400 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran are added.Immediately, precipitation of pyridine hydrochloride occurs. The reaction mixture is heated to 450C and then, always under magnetic stirring, is left at room temperature for 45 minutes.At the end the solvent is evaporated under redu red pressure, the crude residue is washed with 1 litre of water and extracted three times with dimethyl ether. After having dried the organic phase on anhydrous sodium sulphate and evaporated the solvent by means of the rotatory evapora tor, 70 g of crude product are obtained, which is purified by Florisil chromatography 100 200Mesh eluting with petroleum ether, then with petroleum ether diethyl ether 10 1.49 Grams of a dense, yellowish oil are obtained, perfectly pure in thin layer chromatography, sub stantially insoluble in water, easily soluble in the common organic solvents. Its structure is confirmed by analytical and spectroscopical data.Elemental analysis for C 23H3403 M.w. 358.49 calcd. C 77.05 H 9.56 found C 76.88 H 9.60.I.R.

Pharm. Exp. Therap. 96, 99 113, 1949 7.

Comp.Int. Pharm. N. 1086 Paris 1978 , by administration by the oral route, comparing AFP 695 with carboxymethylcysteine and sobrerol at the dose hereinafter stated.

AFP 695 and, for comparison, ibu profen, have been administered by oral route 30 minutes before carrageenin, at the doses herein after stated. After edema induction, the animals of each group have been controlled, every 60 mi nutes for 5 consecutive hours, in order to point out the evolution of the inflammatory pro cesseThe results obtained, expressed as volume of edematous limbs, are reported in the Table 4. From the comparison between the values of control rats and those of AFP 695 treated rats, it turns out the very good antiinflammatory activity of the latter, comparable to that of ibuprofen, in the used experimental conditions and at the used doses.

Such an higher pharmacological activity is probably due to BP 695 pulmona ty tropism shown by the pharmacokinetics study see following pages .Gastrolesive action Rats fasting since 18 hours have been treated by oral route with AFP 695 and, for comparison, with Ibuprofen, at the doses hereinafter stated.5 Hours and 30 minutes after treatments, the animals have been sacrificed and the stomach has been withdrawn for gastric mucosa examination.As it is possible to evidence from the results obtained, reported in the Table 6, the gastrolesivity of AFP 695, in the used experimental conditions, is by far lower than that of the reference drugs.

At the moment of treatment rats were fasting since 18 hours. Rats have been then sacrificed in groups of 4 at different times 30 min., 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h.The concentration both of unchanged products and of their metabolites have been measured by gaschromatography in plasma and in the lung.At 30 minutes, and in some instance also at t hour, unchanged AFP 695 has been found in pla sma showing that this product is at least partially absorbed as such.The plasma levels of Ibuprofen proved to be higher after administration of AFP 695 in comparison with the administration of Ibuprofen at equimolar doses. The difference about 15 was more marked in the first two hours and it is relative to a better bioavailability forIbuprofen. Also pulmonary levels of Ibuprofen turned out higher after administration ofAFP 695. The concentrations ratios between lung and plasma in case of Ibuprofen were 0.6 forIbuprofen administration and 0.8 for AFP 695 administration.Compound I is therefore fit as an elective drug with antiinflammatory, analgesic, mucoregulating and anti cough activities, in the therapy of acute and chronic tracheo bronchopulmonary diseases on inflammatory basis asso ciated with catarrh, cough and algic synthoma thology. The present invention refers also to all the industrially applicable aspects connected with the use of AFP 695 as antiinflammatory, analge sic, mucoregulating and anti cough agent. An essential aspect of the invention is therefore provided by pharmaceutical compositions containing predetermined amounts of AFP 695. Such a compound can be administered, particularly, by the oral route, as capsules, extemporary su spension, monodose sachets in a granular sta te or by aerosol, or as suppositories or, finally, by parenteral route vials for injec tion .Of course, the single pharmaceutical forms will contain the active principle together with vei chles, excipients, flavouring agents etc. of conventional use in pharmaceutical technique.
