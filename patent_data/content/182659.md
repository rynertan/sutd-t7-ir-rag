## Description
This invention relates to soft contact lenses of the hydrogel type, and more particularly, to a method for the manufacture of such contact lenses by polymerizing a mixture of hydrophilic monomers and an inert diluent in a lens mold, and thereafter replacing the diluent with water. Soft contact lens of the hydrogel type have traditionally been manufactured either by lathe cutting or spin casting. In the lathe cutting method, a lens blank or button of a substantially anhydrous hydrophilic polymer xerogel is mechanically cut and polished to a lens shape on a fine lathe, and thereafter contacted with water or saline to hydrate the polymer and form the desired hydrogel lens. The mechanics of the lathe cutting process are similar to those utilized in the manufacture of conventional hard contact lenses, except that allowance must be made for swelling of the lens during hydration of the polymer. In the spin casting method, a small quantity of hydrophilic monomer is placed in a concave, optically polished mold, and the mold rotated while the monomers are polymerized to obtain a xerogel lens. The two optical surfaces of the lens are formed simultaneously during polymerization, the outer surface being shaped by the concave mold surface, and the inner surface being shaped by the joint actions of centifugal force generated by the rotating mold and surface tension of the polymerization mixture. The lens produced thereby is contacted with water or saline to hydrate the polymer and form a hydrogel lens as in the case of the lathe cut lens. The manufacture of soft hydrogel lenses by either lathe cutting or spin casting presents a problem in that when the hydrophilic lens is hydrated, considerable expansion of the lens takes place, and the degree of expansion is not always constant or predictable from lens to lens. In the case of lathe cut lens, variable stresses in the xerogel polymer button may cause differences in the optical properties of the final hydrogel lens. In the case of spin casting, lens properties tend to be more uniform but variability may be introduced by differences in polymerization rate or conditions. To avoid the difficulties experienced when hydrating a lens initially formed as anhydrous, hydrophilic xerogel, attempts have been made with varying degrees of success to prepare lenses directly in the expanded gel state. Efforts in this direction have generally not been successful in producing high quality hydrogel contact lens and the method has not addopted commercially. U.S.P. 3,220,960 Re. 27,401 suggests direct molding of hydrogel contact lenses by copolymerizing a hydrophilic monomer in aqueous solution with a cross linking agent to yield an elastic, soft, transparent hydrogel lens. Suitable hydrophilic monomers include esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid with alcohols having hydrophilic groups. U.S.P. 3,660,545 discloses spin casting soft contact lenses by polymerizing a mixture of a hydrophilic monomer with water or a water miscible solvent. Organic solvents readily soluble in water such as a water soluble lower aliphatic alcohol, or a polyvalent alcohol such as glycol, glycerol, dioxane and the like, are disclosed to be suitable solvents. Solvent content of the polymerization mixture is recommended to be between 5 and 50 , and preferably between 15 and 40 by weight. Solvent content is established to assure that the polymerization mixture will constitute a single phase throughout the polymerization, and that the polymerized lens will still swell appreciably when the solvent is replaced with water. U.S.P. 3,699,089 discloses spin casting soft contact lenses by polymerizing hydrophilic monomers in the presence of a water miscible solvent under substantially anhydrous conditions. Suggested solvents are ethylene glycol, glycerol, formamide, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, the glycol esters of lactic acid and the liquid polyethylene glycols. The solvent content of the polymerization mixture is recommended to substantially exceed the final equilibrium water level of the hydrogel so that the cast lens shrinks when the solvent is displaced with water. U.S.P. 3,780,003 relates to polymers of alkoxy and hydroxy alkyl acrylates or methacrylates and, while not specifically concerned with the manufacture of contact lenses, discloses in Example II the preparation of a transparent, cross linked gel by polymerizing a mixture of HEMA and EEMA with 40 by volume tetrahydrofuran. U.S.P. 4,347,198 discloses a method for static casting or molding contact lenses by polymerizing a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers with from 5 to 95 by weight of a solvent. The solvent is characterized as being one that does not obstruct the polymerization reaction or post cross linking reaction, and which preferably results in a transparent polymerization product. Where the monomers are N vinyl pyrrolidone and methyl methacrylate, the solvent is preferably dimethyl sulfoxide and or ethylene carbonate, optionally with a small amount of dioxane. Other suggested solvents include dimethylformamide, N methyl pyrrolidone, dimethyl acetamide, and a mixture of ethylene glycol and water. U.K. Patent Application G.B. 2,097,805 discloses a method for static casting or molding soft contact lenses by polymerizing a substantially anhydrous polymerization mixture of acrylic or methacrylic monomers with a water displaceable ester formed of boric acid and a compound containing 3 or more hydroxyl groups. The amount of the boric acid ester diluent in the polymerization mixture is preferably controlled so that the diluent is displaced substantially on a 1 1 basis and lens size and shape is not significantly altered during displacement of the ester with water. It is apparent from the disclosures of the above patent references that suitable solvents or diluents for specific polymerization systems have been selected on the basis of trial and error in an effort to identify those materials which will not interfere with the polymerization reaction, can be readily displaced with water following polymerization, and yield a hydrogel contact lens which is optically clear and has good mechanical properties. We have found that, with the exception of the boric acid ester, the solvents or diluents suggested in the prior art for use in the polymerization of hydrophilic monomers do not yield HEMA based hydrogel contact lenses having the aforesaid desirable optical and mechanical properties. Many of these prior art diluents result in lenses which are cloudy or hazy, near opaque or actually white. Other materials yield lenses which are optically clear but lacking in mechanical properties as indicated by a low modulus of the final hydrogel lens. The boric acid ester diluent of G.B. 2,097,805 can yield a HEMA based hydrogel contact lens with good optical and mechanical properties, but some difficulties may be experienced in molding lenses of relatively thick cross section, i.e., in excess of 1mm, where displacement of the diluent with water does not occur as rapidly as in the case of a thinner cross section. When the molded lens containing the boric acid ester diluent is placed in water or saline for replacement of the diluent with water, the boric acid ester quickly hydrolyzes to the polyhydric alcohol and boric acid. If the flux of water is high, such as in the case of a very thin contact lens in agitated water, the boric acid will be kept in solution during the replacement process. If on the other hand, the flux of water is low, such as in the case of a lens of thicker cross section and or in static water, the boric acid may crystallize as sharp needles inside the hydrogel lens with an adverse affect on both mechanical and optical properties. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a method for selecting suitable diluents for various hydrophilic polymer compositions used in the manufacture of soft hydrogel contact lenses. It is a further object of this invention to define various polymerization systems which include a diluent and are suitable for the preparation of soft hydrogel contact lenses. A yet further object of this invention is to define the parameters of desirable diluents useful in the preparation of soft HEMA based hydrogel contact lenses having desirable optical and mechanical properties. These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from the ensuing description and claims. According to the present invention there is provided a method of preparing shaped hydrogel articles, such as soft hydrophilic contact lenses, by forming a polymerization mixture comprising one or more hydrophilic monomers, a cross linking agent, and from about 20 to 95 by weight of a diluent which is a water displaceable organic composition having a viscosity and R value falling within Area A of Figure I, said viscosity being from about 100 to 500,000 M Pa sec at 30 C, and said R value being from 0 to about 16 as determined by Hansen s cohesion parameters for the diluent and the polymer according to the following equation The hydrophilic monomers include the hydroxyacrylates such as hydroxyethylacrylate and hydroxyethylmethacrylate, the N vinyl lactams such as N vinyl pyrrolidone and mixtures thereof. The polymerization mixture may additionally contain one or more other hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomers to impart desired physical properties to the product such as methylmethacrylate, methacrylic acid and styrene. Diluents having a viscosity and R value within Area A of Figure I yield hydrogel lenses having good optical and mechanical properties, Diluents having viscosity and R values which fall outside Area A of Figure I may be expected to yield lenses having poor optical and or mechanical properties. Specifically, diluents which fall within Area B of Figure I are characterized by generally undesirably low physical strength. Diluents which fall within Area C of Figure I typically have poor optical clarity which may vary from hazy to white. Lenses are prepared with diluents selected according to the present invention using static or spin casting methods known in the art and previously used with other diluents as disclosed for example in G.B. 2,097,805 and U.S.P. 3,660,545, which references are incorporated herein by reference for their teaching of manufacturing methods. Figure I is a semilog plot of diluent viscosity and R value, showing within the enclosed Area A the diluents which produce acceptable hydrogel contact lenses. Figure II is a plot of the Hansen cohesion parameters The terms hydrogel and hydrogel polymer as used herein refer to water insoluble hydrophilic polymer compositions which contain imbibed water in an amount ranging generally from about 20 to about 95 by weight of the composition The term hydrophilic monomer as used herein refers to a monomer which, when polymerized, yields an anhydrous hydrophilic polymer or xerogel which is capable of forming a hydrogel when exposed to water. Preferred among such monomers are the hydroxyacrylates which have found wide acceptance in the preparation of soft contact lenses. Specific hydroxyacrylate monomers which may be utilized to form hydrophilic hydrogel polymer compositions are those of the formula wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, most preferably methyl, and R₂ is an alkylene of 2 to 4 carbon atoms, most preferable 2 carbon atoms. The most preferable hydroxyacrylate monomer and most commonly used in the preparation of soft hydrogel contact lenses is hydroxyethyl methacrylate HEMA . Other such monomers include hydroxyethyl acrylate HEA , hydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate and hydroxytrimethylene acrylate. The hydroxyacrylate monomers are generally copolymerized with a minor amount of one or more other monomers which may be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic and are selected to impart specific chemical or physical properties to the resulting hydrogel copolymer. Included among such comonomers as disclosed in the prior art are isobutyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid, styrene, ethoxyethylmethacrylate, vinyl acetate, methyl methacrylate, N vinyl pyrrolidone, methoxytriethyleneglycal methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxytrimethylene acrylate and methoxyethylmethacrylate. Alternatively, the major hydrophilic monomer component may be an N vinyl lactam, preferably N vinyl pyrrolidone, while the minor component is a hydroxy acrylate monomer, preferably HEMA, and or one or more of the other above enumerated comonomers. Specific base polymer formulations for representative hydrophilic compositions, i.e., formulations of primary monomers not including cross linking agents, catalysts or polymerization initiators, and the water content of the resulting product, are presented in Table I along with the reference source disclosing the polymer composition and its use in the preparation of soft hydrogel contact lenses. The hydrophilic polymers are preferably lightly cross linked to form a three dimensional network. A small amount of a cross linking agent, usually from 0.05 to 2 and most frequently from 0.05 to 1.0 , by weight of a diester or triester, is included in the polymerization mixture. Examples of representative cross linking agents include ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, 1,2 butylene dimethacrylate, 1,3 butylene dimethacrylate, 1,4 butylene dimethacrylate, propylene glycol diacrylate, propylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, dipropylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, dipropylene glycol diacrylate, glycerine trimethacrylate, trimethylol propane triacrylate, trimethylol propane trimethacrylate, and the like. Typical cross linking agents usually, but not necessarily, have at least two ethylenically unsaturated double bonds. The polymerization reaction generally also includes a catalyst, usually from about 0.05 to 1 percent by weight of a free radical catalyst. Typical examples of such catalysts include lauroyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, isopropyl percarbonate, azobisisobutyronitrile and known redox systems such as the ammonium persulfate sodium metabisulfite combination. Irradiation by ultraviolet light, electron beam or a radioactive source may also be employed to catalyze the polymerization reaction, optionally with the addition of a polymerization initiator. The polymerization is carried out in admixture with an inert, water displaceable diluent, and in a suitable lens mold so that the product of the polymerization is a shaped, polymeric gel containing the diluent within the interstices of the polymeric network. This method of polymerization is described in detail in G.B. 2,097,805 in connection with the use of a boric acid ester diluent. The diluents of the present invention do not form crystalline compounds during the replacement of the diluent with water even if the flux of water is low as in the case of the boric acid ester diluent. If the diluent is of limited water solubility, it may be necessary to first replace the diluent with a water soluble solvent such as ethanol, and thereafter replace the ethanol with water. The need for such an intermediate washing step is easily discerned for any given diluent composition. In accordance with the present invention, the diluent for use in the polymerization reaction is selected for any given polymer composition on the basis of the Hansen solubility parameter for that polymer. Hansen s solubility parameter δ is usually expressed in terms of three components δ The Hansen solubility parameter, and the individual cohesion parameters, for any given polymer composition may be determined theoretically by the group contribution method, or experimentally by determining the extent of polymer solubility or swelling in a number of solvents for which the cohesion parameters are known. The experimental method is considered to be more accurate and is accordingly preferred. An example of this method in determining the solubility parameter for two cellulose acetate polymers in three dimensions δ Using the experimental method, the Hansen cohesion parameters δ A two dimensional plot of the solubility of the HEMA MAA polymer according to the cohesion parameters δ The Hansen cohesion parameters of PHEMA and other hydrophilic polymer compositions were determined to be as follows The parameters for PVP were computed from swelling data reported in The Universality of the Solubility Parameter, I. and E.C. Product Research and Development, C. M. Hansen, Vol. 8, pp 1 6 1969 . The data for PHEA were calculated by the group contribution method using the group values given on pp.85 87 of the CRC Handbook. The data for PHEMA were also calculated by the group contribution method for comparison to the results obtained experimentally by the solvent swelling method as described above. Calculated values are considered to be an approximation of the more accurate values determined experimentally. The δ Figure I is a plot of the results obtained in the preparation of hydrogel contact lenses by polymerizing the aforesaid 98 2 HEMA MAA monomer formulation with a number of diluents having a range of cohesion parameters. The monomer diluent mixtures were cast into lenses using the general procedures and molds described in G.B. 2,097,805. Since the polymer composition was determined to hydrate to about 58 water, the casting solutions were made up with 60 by volume diluent. Thus, when the diluent was exchanged with water, there was only slight shrinkage in the physical dimensions of the cast lens. The polymerization mixture comprising the monomers, 0.4 ethylene glycol dimethacrylate cross linking agent, the diluent and a small amount of photoinitiator was placed into a concave lens mold, and a convex lid put in place to define a mold cavity in the shape of a plano lens filled with the polymerization mixture. The molds were fabricated of clear polystyrene, and the polymerization was initiated by exposing the assembled mold to UV light for a period of 10 minutes. After polymerization was completed, the molds were immersed in warm water and allowed to soak for about 20 minutes, after which time sufficient water had penetrated into the mold and polymeric gel to allow the lid portion of the mold to be removed and the polymer gel separated from the mold cavity. The lens was thoroughly washed with 2 to 3 rinses of demineralized water as necessary to remove the diluent, then soaked in 0.9 NaCl normal saline for about 2 hours. The finished lens was visually graded for optical clarity, and if found acceptable, tested for physical strength. Referring now to Table III, there are listed twenty one diluent compositions which yielded optically clear lenses having an acceptable modulus E of 0.12 M Pa or greater. The cohesion parameters δ The viscosity of the diluent at 30 C η₃₀ was determined on a Brookfield Model LVF viscometer according to the standard operating procedure for that instrument. The modulus of the resultant lens as given in Table III was determined on a microtensile test apparatus while the sample was immersed in normal saline solution according to the following procedure. A lens test sample 3 mm wide and a full diameter long was cut from the hydrogel lens with a dual bladed instrument. The test sample was adhesively attached with cyanoacrylate adhesive to the ends of two aluminum pull strips spaced 10 mm apart. The lens sample and aluminum pull strips were immersed in normal saline 0.9 NaCl buffered to pH of 7.2 and allowed to equilibrate. The thickness of the lens sample t was measured with an optical microscope to 1 micron. Two spots 1 to 2 mm apart were marked on the surface of the lens sample at a point approximately mid way between the ends of the aluminum strips. The test sample with attached aluminum strips was then placed in the microtensile test apparatus which allowed the lens sample to be elongated while suspended vertically and immersed in saline solution. The sample was held taut at zero load and the distance between the marks on the lens strip measured and noted as zero length ℓ wherein Referring now to Table IV, there are listed diluents numbered 22 to 36 which failed to yield hydrogel lenses of acceptable optical and or physical properties. Many of the lenses were clear but had low strength as indicated by a modulus value E of 0.10 or less. Several of the other lenses were white or opaque indicating incompatibility between the diluent and the polymer. In all cases, the diluents of Table IV were rejected for use with the HEMA MAA copolymer of the test. The diluents indicated in Tables III and IV as esters of an acid or anhydride with a polyol are not pure esters, but are rather a reaction product containing the ester in combination with any excess of the reactants. The weight ratio of the individual reactants employed in the esterification reaction is provided in the parentheses following the indicated ester. Preferred compositions in this class of diluents comprise the reaction product of a di or tricarboxylic acid or anhydride with a C₃ to C₄ alkane diol or triol, and mixtures thereof with glycerol triethylene glycol, propylene glycol and hexane 1,2,6 triol. As a separate class of useful diluents, there are those compositions comprising mixtures of glycerol with a polyhydroxyl compound having at least two hydroxy groups and a Hansen cohesion parameter δ The data of Tables III and IV as plotted in Figure I define an area A of generally acceptable diluents for casting optically clear hydrogel articles having good mechanical properties. This area is seen to be a function of diluent viscosity and R value which in turn is a function of the Hansen cohesion parameters δ One data point corresponding to Diluent No. 22 of Table IV is seen to be an unacceptable diluent falling squarely within Area A of Figure I. It is noted that this diluent produced an optically clear lens but was rejected for poor mechanical properties, i.e., modulus of 0.09. While there is no sure explanation for this aberration in the data, it is possible that some unknown impurity in the lactic acid was responsible. Area A is seen to lie broadly within the range where the R value is 0 to 16 and viscosity is 100 to 500,000 m Pa sec. A particularly preferred range within Area A includes an R value of from about 5 to 14, and viscosity of from about 1,000 to 100,000. While the data of Tables III and IV were generated with a PHEMA polymer, or more specifically with the 98 2 HEMA MAA polymer as described above, the test method is applicable to a number of hydrophilic polymer compositions. Thus, for example, polymers comprising HEMA, HEA, N vinyl pyrrolidone, or other hydrophilic monomer alone or copolymerized with one or more other hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomers which are known to be useful in the preparation of shaped hydrogel articles such as soft contact lenses, may be polymerized in the presence of a diluent as described herein. The amount of diluent admixed with the monomers prior to polymerization is selected on the basis of the final equilibrium water content of the hydrogel, and according to whether any expansion or shrinkage of the molded gel lens is desired during the exchange of water for diluent. Representative polymerization mixtures include The present invention contemplates the desirability of casting shaped hydrogel articles from all hydrophilic polymer compositions, and provides a method whereby the diluents most likely to produce acceptable products with such polymeric compositions may be readily identified and characterized, thereby avoiding the time consuming, trial and error methods of the past. The present invention is accordingly not restricted to HEMA based polymers or to the specific examples presented herein, but extends to the improved method for preparing shaped hydrogel articles as set forth in the claims appended hereto.
