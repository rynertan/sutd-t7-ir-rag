# FUEL INJECTOR

## Abstract
A fuel injector for a gas turbine engine comprises a hollow body 12 having an upstream air inlet 43 and downstream primary and secondary air outlets 28 and 30 respectively . The primary air outlets 28 are disposed to direct primary air substantially parallel to the axis of the hollow body 12 . The secondary air outlets 30 are disposed radially inwardly of the respective primary air outlets 28 and arranged to discharge secondary air outwardly so as to subject the primary air to shear. Fuel passages 21 are disposed so as to discharge fuel through the primary air outlets 28 in the same direction as the primary air. The shearing action promotes efficient atomisation of fuel in the required distribution pattern without using a swirling action.
