# Antisoil nylon fibers.

## Abstract
Antisoil nylon fibers are provided by first coating the fibers with a polyacrylic acid and then with a fluorochemical. The polyacrylic acid chemically bonds to the curface of the fibers and to the fluorochemical. The resulting coating has greater adherence to the fiber than does corresponding coatings from which the polyacrylic acid is omitted.

## Description
ANTI SOIL NYLON FIBERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A. Field of the Invention This invention relates to processes for imparting water and oil repellency properties to nylon fibers by applying fluorochemicals particles to the surface of the fibers from aqueous dispersions thereof.More particularly, the invention relates to an improvement in such processes whereby the fluorochemical particles are more tenaciously attached to the nylon surface. B. Description of the Prior Art Fluorochemicals, such as, Scotchgard fluorochemicals a brand name of Minnesota Minning andManufacturing Company and Zepel and Teflon fluorochemicals brand names of duPont , are industrially used to provide fiber surfaces with water and oil repellency properties, i.e., antisoiling properties. In the prior art processes, fluorochemicals are used in the form of aqueous dispersions having a particle size ranging from 200 to 100C angstroms in diameter. The particles are conventionally dispersed by means of an emulsifier which may impart a charge to the particles. Fibers are treated with the dispersions and then dried leaving a coating of the fluorochemical particles on the fiber surface.The bonding or fixation of the particles to the surface is mainly by the van der Waals and Coulombic forces between the fluorochemical particles and the fiber surface, thereby limiting the strength of the bonding to 5 to 10Kcal. mol bonding. Consequently, fluorochemical losses from the coated fibers during the dyeing of the fibers or fabrics made therefrom e.g. carpeting are often substantial. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improvement in the above mentioned prior art processes for using fluorochemicals to impart antisoiling properties to nylon fiber surfaces. The improvement enhances the fixation of the coating of fluorochemical particles to the fiber surfaces and comprises the preliminary step of coating the fibers with a material which chemically bonds to the fiber surfaces and which will bond to positively charged fluorochemical particles when brought into contact therewith. The material functions as an interlayer between the surface of the fibers and the coating of fluorochemical particles.Nylon fibers coated with fluorochemical particles in accordance with the improvement of the present invention have more durable and longer lasting antisoiling properties the fixation of the fluorochemical particles to the fiber surface is enhanced as compared to corresponding coatings in which the interlayer is omitted. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION In practicing the improvement of the present invention nylon fibers are first coated with an interlayer material and then with a fluorochemical. The interlayer material forms a chemical bond with the nylon surface of the fibers and with the fluorochemical. Any nylon fiber may be treated in accordance with the improvement of the present invention. The term nylon fiber as used herein means a fiber in which the fiber forming substance is any long chain synthetic polyamide having recurring amide groups NH CO as an integral part of the polymer chain. Such substances include nylon 66, which is polyhexamethylene adipamide, and nylon 6, which is polycaprolactam.The fiber may be in the form of a continuous filament30r a yarn composed of continuous filaments or a yarn composed of staple. Materials which may be used to form the interlayer coating in accordance with the improvement of the invention are materials which are capable of chemically bonding to positively charged fluorochemical particles and to the surface of nylon fibers.Representative such materials include, polyacrylic acid PAA and polymethacrylic acid PMA and copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid with one or more vinyl monomers copolymerizable therewith such as vinyl acetate, methylacrylate, methacrylate, styrene, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride and the like. The copolymers are composed of at least 10 and, preferably, at least 25 by weight of the acrylic or methacrylic acid. The interlayer material is preferably applied to the nylon fibers from an aqueous medium, and then the fibers dried before they are treated with the fluorochemicals otherwise, the fluorochemicals tend to attach to the nylon fiber surface before the interlayer material has had a chance to react with the nylon fiber surface. The fibers may be dried under ambient conditions or may be heated to shorten the drying time.Preferably, the material is applied to the fibres from an aqueous medium comprising from 5X10 to 5X10 moles per litre of the material. Fluorochemicals which may be used in practicing the improvement of the invention include those containing one or more fluorinated aliphatic radicals having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms and having a carbon bonded fluorine content of 40 78 by weight.Preferably, the radical is perfluoro alkyl radicals of the general formula C F Generally, the fluorochemicals will contain 10 n 2n 1 to 60 by weight of carbon bonded fluorine. The fluorochemical are preferably applied to the nylon fibers from aqueous dispersions of positively charged fluorochemical particles. Such aqueous dispersions are prepared by dispersing the fluorochemical particles in an aqueous medium using emulsifiers such as quaternary ammonium salts as the dispersing agent. The emulsifier imparts a positive charge to the particles. Fluorochemicals, such as, Scotchguard, Zepel and Teflon fluorochemicals are already commercially available in the form of an aqueous dispersion of positively charged fluorchemical particles. The dispersion preferably comprises from 0.5 to 2.0 by weight of fluorine. The following examples are given to further illustrate the invention. In the examples, parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE 1 Skeins of continuous filament nylon 66 carpet yarn having a total denier of about 1300 and being composed of 68 filaments were impregnated with an aqueous solution of PAA having an average molecular weight of 250,000. After centrifugation and air drying for 2 hours, the skeins were immersed in aqueous dispersions of commercially obtained fluorochemicals, i.e., eitherScotchgard fluorochemical designated FC 391 or L 5111. After contrifugation, each skein was divided into two yarns of approximately equal length one yarn was vacuum dried over night and analysed for fluorine the other yarn was blank dyed in an aqueous medium for 75 minutes at the boil 1000C. , vacuum dried over night and then analysed for fluorine. The concentration of fluorine EF on the fiber surface before blank dyeing, expressed in parts per million ppm , and the amount of fluorine retained after blank dyeing, expressed as a percentage are given in the table below. The concentration of PAA E PAA in the aqueous solution and the concentration of fluorine F 3 in the aqueous dispersion of the fluorochemical is also given in the table. TABLE PAA Fluoro F F on F retentionItem moles Chemical Fiber liter surface ppm 1 none L 5111 1.0 240 82 2 10 3 L 5111 1.0 1000 79 3 10 2 L 5111 1.0 1509 100 4 10 3 L 5111 1.0 8800 78 5 none FC 391 0.67 150 60 6 10 3 FC 391 0.67 206 65 7 10 2 FC 391 0.67 565 83 8 10 1 FC 391 0.67 1060 52 The data in the table show the influence ofPAA on fluorine uptake, as well as on F retention after blank dyeing. For the cationic fluorochemicals used, the uptake increased with PAA , whereas the retention had a maximum at a PAA of 10 2 moles liter. If the ratio of PAA F is too low there are not enough COOH groups available to bond with the positive charges of the fluorine particles, and the F retention is low.If the ratio is too high, part of the PAA molecules are not bonded to the nylon surface of the fiber and are washed off during dyeing, taking with them fluorine particles which are bonded thereto. For the fluorine concentration F used in this example F in the aqueous fluorocarbon dispersion , a PAA of about 10 2 moles liter appears to give best fluorine retention. When using different fluorine concentrations, experiments such as those shown in the above table can be carried out to determine optimum polyacrylic acid concentrations. In related experiments similar results were obtained when using polymethacrylic acid instead of polyacryiic acid. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the nylon continuous filament yarn is treated during its melt spinning operation by passing the yarn after it is quenched over two inline applicator rolls before the yarn is collected. The first roll applies the interlayer e.g. PAA to the surface of the yarn fibers and the second roll applies the aqueous dispersion of positively charged particles of fluorochemical to the interlayer. The yarn is dried after application of the interlayer material and before application of the fluorochemical by passing it over a heated roll. The yarn may be dried by passing it around a heated roll, for example, around a heated separator roll and its associated idler roll with one or more wraps.
