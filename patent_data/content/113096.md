## Description
MODIFIED POLYESTER COMPOSITIONS Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to modified thermoplastic polyester compositions which may be molded or otherwise processed into articles having improved physical properties and particularly improved impact strength. Specifically, poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resin has been found to be a useful impact strength enhancer for impact modified polyethylene terephthalate compounds.2. Description of the Prior Art. High molecular weight linear polyesters and copolyesters of glycols and terephthalic or isophthalic acid have been available for some time.Examples of these materials are described in U.S. 2,465,319 Whinfield et al and U.S. 3,047,539 Pengilly and elsewhere. These patents are incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, these patents disclose materials that are particularly advantageous as film and fiber formers. With the development of molecular weight control, the use of nucleating agents and two step molding cycles, poly ethylene terephthalate has become an important constituent of injection moldable compositions. Poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , because of its very rapid crystallization from the melt, is uniquely useful as a component in such compositions. Workpieces molded from such polyester resins, alone or combined with reinforcements, in comparison with other thermoplastics, offer a high degree of surface hardness and abrasion resistance, high gloss, and lower surface friction. Stable polyblends of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate and poly ethylene terephthalate can be molded into useful unreinforced and reinforced articles. See Fox and Wambach, U.S. Pat. No.3,953,394, incorporated herein by reference. It has been proposed to increase the impact strengths of polyesters by adding various modifiers.For example, Brinkman et al in U.S. Pat. No. 3,591,659 discloses that a useful family of modifiers comprises polyalkyl acrylates, methacrylates and or ethacrylates. Baron et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,044,073 disclose that a useful impact modifier for such polyesters is an aromatic polycarbonate. Schlichting et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,022,748 disclose that a rubber elastic graft copolymer having a glass temperature below 20 C. is a useful modifier. Lane,U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,013, Feomuth et al., U.S. Pat. No.4,180,494, and Farnham et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,096,202 disclose that useful impact modifiers comprise multiple stage polymers having a rubbery first stage and a hard final stage, preferably including units derived from alkyl acrylates, especially butyl acrylates. Baron et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,016 corres. German Pat. No. 2,650,870 disclose an impact modifier combination comprising a blend of a polyurethane and an aromatic polycarbonate. Copending applicationSer. No. 870,679, filed Jan. 19, 1978, discloses an impact modifier combination comprising a segmented block copolyester and an aromatic polycarbonate.Copending application Ser. No. 957,801, filed Nov. 6, 1978, discloses an impact modifier combination comprising a blend of a polyalkylacrylate and an aromatic polycarbonate. Gergen et al, U.S. Pat. No.4,090,996 disclose an impact modifier combination for poly l,4 butylene terephthalate and other polyester resins comprising a selectively hydrogenated monoalkenyl arene diene block copolymer, and an engineering thermoplastic, e.g., poly aryl ether , poly aryl sulfone , polycarbonate, acetal, etc.Nakamura et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,864,428 disclose poly butylene terephthalate alone or combined in blends with other polyesters, impact modified with conjugated diene vinyl aromatic copolymers grafted with methacrylate monomer and aromatic polycarbonate. Additional means for modifying the impact strength of polyester compositions are also known.For example, Cohen et al, in U.S. 4,257,937 disclose that poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate resin or blends of such resin with poly ethylene terephthalate resin can be modified with a combination of polyacrylate resin and an aromatic polycarbonate resin. In U.S.4,157,997, DeMejo et al. disclose that polyalkylene terephthalate resins can be impact modified with an organopolysiloxane polycarbonate block copolymer and a calcium carbonate filler. Dieck discloses in U.S. 4,280,948 that thermoplastic polyester compositions can be modified with a combination of an acrylic or methacrylic grafted polymer of a conjugated diene, either alone or in combination with a vinyl aromatic and an aromatic polycarbonate. In U.S. 4,267,286,Campbell discloses that thermoplastic polyester compositions can be modified with a combination of a polyacrylate resin or a vinyl aromatic diene block copolymer resin and a poly 1,3 butylene terephthalate . And Holub discloses in U.S. 4,122,061 that impact modified thermoplastic polyester compositions can be provided by utilizing a polyolefin or olefin based copolymer resin as an impact modifier.Each of the foregoing patents and applications are hereby incorporated by reference. It is well known that poly ethylene terephthalate , as an injection molding resin, suffers not only dimensional stability problems due to its semi crystyalline structure but it also exhibits poor notched Izod impact. Attempts to impact modify poly ethylene terephthalate with acrylic impact modifiers which are normally effective in poly l,4 butylene terephthalate have not been as successful. It has now been discovered that acrylic impact modified versions of poly ethylene terephthalate can exhibit dramatically improved impact resistance by utilizing certain effective amounts of poly l,4butylene terephthalate . Surprisingly, replacement of 30 percent, for example, of the poly ethylene terephthalate with poly l,4 butylene terephthalate provides injection molded parts which exhibit good to excellent impact. This is especially surprising since those skilled in the art would normally expect to see a gradual rise in impact strength as the level of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate is increased.Additionally, improvements in tensile strength and tensile elongation can be found in the compositions of the present invention. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the above described advantageous properties can be obtained even when reprocessed recycled or otherwise scrap poly ethylene terephthalate is used in the formulations thereby adding the advantage of economy and material conservation to those of property enhancement. Summary of the Invention There are provided by the present invention certain useful thermoplastic compositions which are useful for molding, e.g. injection molding, compression molding, transfer molding, and the like as well as for other applications, wherein the compositions are comprised of a a polyester resin comprised primarily of poly ethylene terephthalate resin b an impact modifier therefore comprising i a poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resin ii a polyacrylate resin and iii an aromatic polycarbonate resin wherein modifier b is present in an amount up to, approximately, 60 weight percent based upon the total weight of a and b . Preferably, impact modifier b will be present in an amount of at least about 30 parts by weight per 100 parts of a and b together, and more preferably, modifier b will be present in an amount of approximately, 35 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts of a and b together. Preferably, impact modifier b will be comprised of, approximately, i 10 to 30 parts by weight of poly 1,4 butylene terephthalate resin ii 10 to 15 parts by weight of polyacrylate resin and iii 10 to 15 parts by weight of aromatic polycarbonate resin based upon the total weight of a , b i 1 b ii , and b iii . In the composition of the present invention, the polyester resin a will ordinarily have an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.4 deciliters aram when measured in solution in a 60 40 mixture of phenol and tetrachloroethane at 30 C. The polyacrylate resin b ii is a core shell resin of the type commonly used to modify polyesters.These materials are commercially available, especially preferred resins being Acryloid KM 330 and KM653 sold by Rohm Haas. Such a core shell resin will have a rubbery core which is surrounded by a grafted acrylic shell. The aromatic polycarbonate resin is preferably derived from bisphenol A. Naturally, the compositions of the present invention can further comprise c fillers and or reinforcing agents in an amount of from about 5 to 60 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of a , b , and c together. Additionally, flame retardant amounts of various effective flame retarding agents can also be utilized. Description of the Invention The polyester resins a of the compositions of this invention are available commercially or can be prepared by known techniques such as by the alcoholysis of esters of terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol or butanediol and subsequent polymerization, by heating the glycols with the free acids or with halide derivatives thereof, and similar processes. These are described in U.S. Pat. No.2,465,319, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,047,539, and elsewhere. Illustratively, the high molecular weight poly ethylene terephthalate resins will have an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.3 deciliters gram and preferably, at least 0.4 deciliters gram as measured in 60 40 phenol tetrachlorethane mixture or a similar solvent at 30 C. The poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resins b i will have intrinsic viscosities of at least 0.6 and more preferably 0.8 dl. g., same basis. The upper limit is not critical, but it will generally be about 1.5 dl. g. Especially preferred poly ethylene terephthalates will have an intrinsic viscosity in the range 0.5 1.0 and preferred poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resins will be in the range of 0.9 1.2 dl. g. Especially useful when high melt strength is important are branched high melt viscosity poly alkylene terephthalate resins, which include a small amount of e.g., up to 5 mole percent based on the terephthalate units, of a branching component containing at least three ester forming groups. The branching component can be one which provides branching in the acid unit portion or in the glycol unit portion of the polyester, or it can be a hybrid. Illustrative of such branching components are tri or tetracarboxylic acids, such as trimesic acid, pyromellitic acid, and lower alkyl esters thereof, and the like, or preferably, polyols, and especially preferably, tetrols, such as pentaerythritol, triols, such as trimethylolpropane or dihydroxy carboxylic acids and hydroxdicarboxylic acids and derivates, such as tartaric acid, and the like. The branched poly l,4 butylene terephthalate resins and their preparation are described in Borman,U.S. Pat. No. 3,953,404, incorporated herein by reference. Impact modifier b comprises a combination of i a polytl,4 butylene terephthalate resin as described above ii a polyacrylate resin and iii an aromatic polycarbonate.The polyacrylate resin b ii can be made in known ways and they are available from a number of sources, e.g., Rohm Haas Company, Philadelphia, U.S.A. under the trade designations Acryloid KM330 and KM653. In general, any of the polyalkyl acrylates described inBrinkmann et al., UcS. Pat. No. 3,591,659 may be used.Preferably, the polyacrylate resin will be in the form of a rubber elastic graft copolymer having a glass transition temperature below 20 C. as described inSchlichting et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,022,748.Especially preferred grafted co polymers are the coreshell co polymers of the type available from Rohm BR nanas, mentioned above. In general these polyacrylate resins will contain units derived from butadiene or isoprene, alone or in combination with a vinyl aromatic compound, or n butyl acrylate, alone or in combination with a vinyl aromatic compound. The aforementioned impact modifiers are believed to be disclosed in Fromuth et al, U.S. 4,180,494 0wens U.S.3,808,180 Farnham et al U.S. 4,096,202t and Cohen et al U.S. 4,260,693, all incorporated herein by reference. Most preferably, the polyacrylate resins will comprise a two stage polymer having either a butadiene or n butyl acrylate based rubbery core and a second stage polymerized from methylmethacrylate alone or in combination with styrene. Also present in the first stage may be cross linking monomers and graft linking monomers. Examples of the cross linking monomers include 1,3 butylene diacrylate, divinyl benzene and butylene dimethacrylate.. Examples of graft linking monomers are allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate and diallyl maleate. Additional preferred impact modifiers are of the type disclosed in U.S. 4,292,233, incorporated by reference. These impact modifiers comprise, generally, a relatively high content of a cross linked butadiene polymer grafted base having grafted thereon acrylonitrile and styrene. The polycarbonate resins b iii can be made in known ways and they are available commercially from sources, e.g., General Electric Company, Pittsfield,Mass., U.S.A., under the trademark LEANS, In general, any of the aromatic polycarbonates described in Baron et al, U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,016 can be used, especially those including units derived from bisphenol A. In certain preferred features the composition will include fillers, especially fillers such as fibrous filamentous glass or clay, mica, talc and the like, preferably clay. The fillers can be untreated or treated with silane or coupling agents, etc. The filamentous glass to be employed as reinforcement in such embodiments of the present compositions is well known to those skilled in the art and is widely available from a number of manufacturers. For compositions ultimately to be employed for electrical uses, it is preferred to use fibrous glass filaments comprised of lime aluminum borosilicate glass that is relatively soda free. This is known as E glass. However, other glasses are useful where electrical properties are not so important, e.g., the low soda glass known as C glass.The filaments are made by standard processes, e.g., by steam or air blowing, flame blowing and mechanical pulling. The preferred filaments for plastic reinforcement are made by mechanical pulling.The filament diameters range from about 0.00012 to 0.00075 inch, but this is not critical to the present invention. The length of the glass filaments and whether or not they are bundled into fibers and the fibers bundled in turn to yarns, ropes or rovings, or woven into mats, and the like, are also not critical to the invention. However, in preparing the molding compositions, it is convenient to use the filamentous glass in the form of chopped strands of from about oneeighth to about 2 inches long. In articles molded from the compositions, on the other hand, even shorter lengths will be encountered because, during compounding considerable fragmentation will occur. This is desirable, however, because the best properties are exhibited by thermoplastic injection molded articles in which the filament lengths lie between about 0.0005 to 0.250 inch. The amount of the filler can vary widely depending on the formulation and needs of the particular composition in a given application, preferably, however, the reinforcing filler will comprise from about 1 to about 60 by weight of filler c and a and b , combined. The impact modified polyesters, alone, or in combination with a filler can be rendered flame retardant with an effective amount of a conventional flame retardant agent d . As is well known, flame retardants can be based on elementary red phosphorus, phosphorus compounds, halogen and nitrogen compounds alone or preferably in further combination with synergists, such as antimony compounds. Especially useful are polymeric and oligomeric flame retardant agents comprising tetrabromobisphenol A carbonate units, see, for example, Wambach, U.S. Pat. No.3,833,685, which is incorporated herein by reference. Other ingredients, such as dyes, pigments, drip retardants, nucleating agents and the like can be added for their conventionally employed purposes. The compositions of this invention can be prepared by a number of procedures. In one method, the modifier b and any filler or fire retardants are put into an extrusion compounder with the polyester resin base a to produce molding pellets.The modifier, and filler and or reinforcement, if any, are dispersed in a matrix of the resin in the process.In another procedure, the modifier b is mixed with the polyester resin base a by dry blending, then either fluxed on a mill and comminuted, or then extruded and chopped. The modifying agent b can also be mixed with the polyester resin base a and directly molded, e.g., by injection or transfer molding techniques. Ordinarily, it is preferable to thoroughly free all of the ingredients polyester resin, modifier, reinforcement, filler, if used, and any optional conventional additives from as much water as possible. However, it has recently been disclosed that polyester compositions may be prepared having a small moisture content. See Lu et al U.S. Patent No.4,351,758, hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, compounding should be carried out to ensure that the residence time in the machine is shorty the temperature is carefully controlled the friction heat is utilized and an intimate blend between the polyester resin and the modifier is obtained. Although it is not essential, best results are obtained if the ingredients are pre compounded, pelletized and then molded. Pre compounding can be carried out in conventional equipment. For example, after carefully pre drying the polyester and modifier and the reinforcing agent, or filler, if used, e.g., under vacuum at 100 C. for 12 hours, a single screw extruder is fed with a dry blend of the ingredients, the screw employed having a long transition section to ensure proper melting. On the other hand, a twin screw extrusion machine, e.g., a 28MM WernerPfleiderer machine can be fed with resins and screw extrusion machine, e.g., a 28MM WernerPfleiderer machine can be fed with resins and additives at the feed port and reinforcement down stream.In either case, a generally suitable machine temperature will be about 4509 to 550. F. The pre compounded composition can be extruded and cut up into molding compounds such as conventional granules, pellets, etc., by standard techniques. The following examples illustrate several embodiments of the present invention but are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any manner. Unless otherwise specified, all parts are by weight. Examples 1 2 Dry blends of reprocessed polyethylene terephthalate resin PET having a PET content of 99 minimum and having an intrinsic viscosity of at least approximately 0.50 dl g and a melting point of approximately 250 C poly 1, 4 butylene terephthalate resin PBT having an intrinsic viscosity of 1.05 dl g and a melt viscosity of approximately 6,200 poise, acrylic rubber, aromatic polycarbonate of bisphenol A and mold release and stabilizing additives were compounded and extruded at 5300F. in an extruder. The extrudate was pelletized and injection molded at 510 F. The formulations and physical properties are shown in Table 1. The results in Table 1 clearly show the efficiency achieved by the compositions of the present invention. The modified compositions cf Examples I and 2 show an unexpected increase in impact strength.
