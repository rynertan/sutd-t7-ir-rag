# Preparation of amino polyols.

## Abstract
Residual alkylene oxide left over after a process for pre paring amino polyols by reacting an amino polyhydric initiator with an alkylene oxide at a temperature of 30 C to 180 C, to form a crude polyol mixture comprising an alkoxy lated amino polyol having a hydroxyl number of 300 to 900, and residual alkylene oxide can be usefully employed, rather than vented to effluent if it is reacted in situ with a second amine at a temperature of 30 C to 180 C to form an alkanolamine which can be used while still mixed with the alkoxylated aminopolyol , in the production of rigid polyurethane foam.
