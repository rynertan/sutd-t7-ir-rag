# Masterslice semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A masterslice semiconductor device comprised of basic cells BC having additional transistors QP₂₀, QN₂₀, QP₄₀, QN₄₀ formed adjacent the longitudinal ends of a transistor pair or pairs QP₁₀, QN₁₀ QP₃₀, QN₃₀ . The basic cells are arranged in columns on to constitute a plurality of basic of basic cell arrays BL . Each of the additional transistors occupies an individual connection region for source and drain and is provided with an individual gate electrode which extends in line with or perpendicularly to the line of extension line of the gates of the transistors of the transistor pair s . The additional transistors occupy space between adjacent basic cell arrays which has previously been exclusively used for distributing wiring lines.
