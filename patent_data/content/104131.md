## Description
INJECTION MOLDING AND PARTIAL CRYSTALLIZATION OF A POLYESTER POLYOLEFIN BLEND IN A HEATED MOLDBackground of the Invention This invention relates to a process for making an injection molded article from a polyester polyolefin blend. More specifically, this invention describes an injection molding process for making a partially crystalline article from a homogeneous blend of high molecular weight polyethylene terephthalate and a polyolefin wherein the mold is at a temperature from 134 C. to 168 C. In injection molding, when polyester PET melt is suddenly chilled in a cold mold, transparent amorphous parts are obtained, however, when these parts are heated to a temperature range above 80 C the softening temperature, or Tg glass transition temperature they show severe distortion, considerable shrinkage, and whitening caused bv relaxation of built in stresses prior to crystallization formation of an ordered morphological structure .Background Art U.S. Patent 3,361,848 discloses injection molding a polyester polyolefin blend. This patent discloses the injection molding of polyesters of aromatic dicarboxylic acids and saturated diols such as the polyester of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.The injected resin contains the aromatic dicarboxylic acid and a saturated diol along with finely distributed high molecular weight polyolefins of 3 to 6 carbon atom mono olefins in an amount of up to 10 percent by weight. The patent discloses that after injection molding the polyolefin containing polyester into a three dimensional article of predetermined shape or configuration, the molded article can be heat set at a temperature of at least about the second order glass transition point of the polyester. U.S. Patent 3,405,198 discloses a process for making impact resistant injection molded polyethylene terephthalate products. This process uses a polyester which comprises polyethylene terephthalate and from .5 to 50 percent by weight of polyethylene. This patent teaches that it is desirable to heat set the injection molded product by subjecting it to an elevated temperature above 100 , i.e., at a temperature above the second order transition point of the polyester. One known method employed to improve the processing characteristics of polyethylene terephthalate consists in working with very hot molds, i.e., 140 C. The disadvantage of using hot molds in processing the molten composition is the sticking of the composition to the mold and distortion upon demolding.Summary of the Invention Disclosed is a process for making a partially crystalline injection molded article comprising injection molding a molten composition into a mold wherein said mold is at a temperature of from 134 C. to 168 C., wherein said molten composition has distributed therein from .5 to 10 percent by weight of a finely divided polyolefin produced from olefin monomers having two to six carbon atoms and 99.5 percent to 90 percent by weight of polyethylene terephthalate. This invention also relates to polyester articles which ar e suitable for use at service temperatures near 2000C. Brief Description of the Drawings The invention is further illustrated by the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view of an injected molded article Figure 2 is a top plan view thereof and Figure 3 is a side cross section view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2.Detailed Description This invention involves injection molding a modified polyester using a heated mold, to partially crystallize the injection molded parts prior to removal from the mold. One advantage of the present invention is that it results in a one step procedure wherein the molten resin is injection molded and is subsequently partially crystallized within the heated mold. It has been unexpectedly found that injection molding of the composition of the present invention in a hot mold results in a process wherein there is the absence of sticking of the resulting article to the mold. Another advantage of the present invention that the use of a polyolefintpolyester composition lowers the power requirements to the screw. Another advantage is easier mold fill as opposed to processing PET.Another advantage is that the use of a polyolefin inPET leads to an increase in the impact strength of the partially crystalline samples. In order to produce articles or containers usable in applications where high service temperatures are encountered, a polyester in the crystalline state rather than the amorphous state is necessary. Of the known thermoplastic, crystallizable polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate offers the desirable properties of good high temperature dimensional stability, chemical, oil and solvent resistance and the ability to withstand microwave radiation without absorbing or reflecting it. These properties make it the polymer of choice for use in high temperature food containers. The polyester useful in forming the injected molded article prepared in accordance with the process constituting the present invention is polyethylene terephthalate. The preparation of polyethylene terephthalate hereinafter referred to as PET can be prepared by the reaction of either terephthalic acid or its lower alkyl ester, dimethyl terephthalate, with ethylene glycol and the resultant glycol ester polymerized to high molecular weight product. As used herein the term high molecular weight means a polyester having an intrinsic viscosity IV ranging from about 0.5 to about 1.10 and preferably from about 0.70 to about 1.0 as measured in a 60 40 by volume mixed solvent of phenol tetrachloroethane at 300C. Since a partially crystalline finished article is necessary for good dimensional stability at high temperature, knowledge of the degree of crystallinity or percent of crystallinity is of considerable importance. Density is a convenient method of measuring percent of crystallinity since there is a direct relationship between the two for a given polyester composition. A calibrated gradient column is used for determining density at a particular temperature. The density value is converted to a percent of crystallinity. As used throughout this specification and the appended claims the term glass transition temperature means that temperature or temperature range at which a change in slope appears in the volume versus temperature curve for said polymer and defining a temperature region below which the polymer exhibits a glassy characteristic and above which the polymer exhibits a rubbery characteristic. The term crystallization temperature means that temperature or temperature range in which a regularly repeating morphology1 brought about by a combination of molecular mobility and secondary bonding forces, is induced in the polymer over a molecular distance of at least several hundred angstroms. The polyolefin which is to be homogeneously blended with PET is produced from olefin monomers having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Various polyolefins can be used in accordance with the present invention such as linear low density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisopropylene, polybutene, polypentene and poly 4 methyl pentene with linear low density being the most preferred. The blending of the polyethylene terephthalate and the polyolefin can be accomplished by many known methods such as before, during or after the polycondensation of the polyester from the usual monomeric reactants. The polyolefin employed should have a molecular weight of at least 100,000 and have a second order transition point which is distinct from the second order transition point of the polyester.Generally, the second order transition point of the polyolefin should correspond to a temperature of from minus 70 C. to plus 200C. The polyolefin can be added to the monomeric dicarboxylic acid or diol reactants prior to the production of the polyester, such as by admixing a finely divided polyolefin with the dimethyl ester of terephthalic acid and subsequently transesterifying and polycondensing with ethylene glycol. Another method is to add the polyolefin to a granulated polyester product. In order to achieve a substantially homogeneous product with uniform improved properties one should blend the two components under conditions of intensive mixing. Preferably the mixing or blending of the two components should be only after first decreasing the water content of the polymers, preferably below .01 by weight of water. Also, it is suggested that contact of the molten polymers with atmospheric oxygen be avoided. The article made from the polyester polyolefin blend of the present invention should have from at least .5 to no more than 10 by weight of polyolefinwith the corresponding 99.5 to 90X PET. Preferably from 2 to 5 by weight of polyolefin and most preferred 3 by weight of polyolefin. One may add heat stabilizers to the polyester polyolefin used in accordance with the present invention. Examples of known stabilizers for use in polyester compositions are disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,987,004, U.S. Patent 3,644,482, and U.S.Patent 3,904,578 herein incorporated by reference.Specific examples of known stabilizers are alkylated phenols, polyphenols, alkylphosphites, arylphosphites, aromatic amines and aromatic polyamines. Preferably polyphenols are used, for example tetrakis methylene 3 3,5 ditertiary butyl 4 hydroxylphenyl propionate methane and l,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 di tertiary butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl benzene. With regard to the level of heat stabilizer added, the amount may range from about .05 to about 2 percent by weight of the total weight of the composition. The particular level used is left to the discretion of the practitioner in light of factors such as degree of protection required, the severity of heat exposure, and any solubility limitation of the chosen heat stabilizer in the polyethylene terephthalate polyolefin blend being utilized. Depending on the eventual use of the article comprised of the polyester polyolefin blend, additives such as dyes, slip agents or fillers may be used, the amounts thereof depending on the particular characteristic desired. In using the polyester polyolefin composition in the process of the present invention, it is possible to use any of the known process steps and variations of the injection molding process as long as the mold is maintained at a temperature ranging from 134 C. to 168 C. Preferably a heated nozzle is employed in order to more easily handle the molten polymer mixture. The advantage of using a hot mold in this temperature range is that it results in ease of processing in the absence of sticking of the article to the sides of the mold. As a result of the use of a mold temperature of from 134 C. to 168 C., the molded article comprising a polyester polyolefin blend is partially crystallized.Under these conditions, a crystallinity ranging from about 10 to 30 percent will be developed in the polyester polyolefin blend comprising the article.This degree of crystallinity was found to provide low shrinkage and impact strength. After the injection molded article has been produced, the molded article does not have to be cooled and subsequently subjected to a heat treatment at elevated temperatures which lies within or above the second order transition range of the polyester. The advantage of this invention results in shorter processing time, thus eliminating the subsequent heat set stage. Due to the partial crystallization within the mold no further shrinkage occurs during subsequent heating even though the temperature is raised above the second order transition range. The duration of the injection molding cycle time will vary depending upon the particular temperature employed and the amount of the weight percentages of the composition injected. As used throughout this specification and appended claims, all pressures are described in kilopascals hereinafter kPa . The following examples are supplied in order to illustrate, but not necessarily to limit, the scope of the present invention. All parts are based on parts by weight unless specifically stated otherwise. All intrinsic viscosity numbers were measured in a 60 40phenol tetrachloroethane mixed solvent at 30 C.

The compound was formed by using a masterbatch of 23 by weight of linear low density polyethylene PET I.V. 1.04 masterbatch having .77 by weight of Ethanox 330. The following examples were conducted on 75 tonVan Dorn injection molding machine utilizing a 6 ounce barrel. A Van Dorn 108V mold base was adapted by modifying and installing a D. M. E. cavity retainer set with corresponding male insert in order to injection mold a 7 inch diameter by 1 2 inch deep plate nominal 40 mils thick . A cold runner system was utilized.Final profile of the dish is given in Figure 1. The mold cavity was chrome plated. Each mold half base was electrically heated using CALROD heaters and thermally controlled with a thermocouple. The compounds were originally in pellet form.Examples 1 3 Utilizing a PET I.V. .72 , three levels of LLDPE 3 , 5 , 10 were evaluated. See Table I for operating conditions. At the 10 level, the injection molded article had a definite tendency of sticking to the hot mold and delamination upon ejection from the hot mold. At the 3 and 5 mold fill was essentially comparable.Examples 4 7 and 33 Utilizing a PET 1.04 five levels of LLDPE 12, 3 , 5 , 10 , 23 were evaluated. See Table I for operating conditions. At 10 and 23 the injection molded article had a definite tendency of sticking to the hot mold surface and delaminating upon ejection from the mold. At the 1 level, mold fill was more difficult in comparison to the higher levels. The inclusion of LLDPE up to five percent had no significant improvement on molding operation. It was judged that 3 is optimum.Examples 8 12 A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the processing injection molding aspects of a particular composition having three weight percent linear low density polyethylene with 97 PET whose starting IV was 1.04. The cycle times and mold temperatures were varied to assess the effects on the part quality. See Table I for operating conditions. The experimental results showed that the rate of crystallization is time and temperature dependent. It is noted that at a Example 8 mold temperature of 1600C. and cycle time of 60 seconds, the part demonstrated excellent rigidity upon demolding, and high surface quality with no sticking. The part did not distort as it cooled and upon insertion in an oven at 200 C. did not lose its configuration. At the same mold temperature of 1600C. but at a cycle time of 30 seconds Example 9 , a good quality part was obtained and no sticking however, the thicker sprue was not solidified. This example demonstrated shorter cycle time feasibility, if a hot runner system is be utilized. At lower mold temperatures, i.e. 137 C. and cycle time of 60 seconds Example 10 a satisfactory part was obtained with no sticking. At the same mold temperature of 137 C., but at a cycle time of 30 seconds Example 11 the part was slightly rubbery and not sufficiently crystallized upon demolding to be permanently set. The part did not stick to the mold. No distinctions were found between Examples 10 and 12.Examples 13 18 The effect of processing unmodified high molecular weight PET I.V. 1.04 no polyolefin additive was investigated by conducting another series of injection molding trials. The cycle times and mold temperatures were varied to evaluate the effects on part quality, distortion, and sticking. See Table I for operating conditions. The results showed that unmodified PET required a delicate balance between mold temperatures and cycle times. .It was quite evident that longer cycle times mold temperature 137 C. were required to achieve the same levels of crystallinity to avoid part distortion upon demolding. At a higher mold temperature 160 C. the part had a tendency of sticking and would also require a longer cycle time to achieve the same level of rigidity of the part upon demolding.Examples 19 26 The effect of processing unmodified PET I.V. .72 no polyolefin additives was investigated by conducting another series of injection molding trials.Again cycle times and mold temperatures were varied to evaluate the effects on part quality, distortion and sticking. See Table I for operating conditions. The results of the trials showed that unmodifted, lower molecular weight PET required a delicate balance between mold temperature and cycle time. It was quite evidence that longer cycle times mold temperature 137 C. were required to achieve the same levels of crystallinity to avoid part distortion upon demolding.At the higher mold temperature 160 C. the part had a tendency of sticking and would also require a longer cycle time to achieve the same level of rigidity of the part upon demolding.Examples 27 29 The effect of adding polypropylene to PET was investigated by conducting a series of experiments looking at part quality. See Table I for oeprating conditions. In each case the part did not stick to the mold, exhibited excellent surface characteristics, and did not deform upon demolding. Examples 30 33 Alternative methods of incorporating the polyolefin modifier were evaluated by preparing compositions whose final composition is 3 LLDPE with 972 PET. One sample Examples 30 31 was formulated by direct mechanical mixing of the 3Z 97Z compound homogeneously blended. The other composition was formed directly in the reactor by adding the appropriate amounts of polyethylene to the polycondensation during the formulation of the PET to yield a 3 by weight polyethylene 97 PET compound. As was seen from the injection molded parts, the mechanical mixture of PE PET yielded a slight degree of variability in the plates likely due to insufficient melt mixing in the extruder. However, the parts processed successfully no mold sticking or distortion . The material made in the reactor did not indicate any processing differences than in Example 5.See Table I for operating conditions. TABLE IEMI15.1 tb EXAMPLE SEP NO.

The injection moldings were conducted using a 75 ton Van Dorn 6 ounce barrel and the ASTM test cluster mold cavity. To assure dispersion, all samples were molded from the corresponding polyester blended with an appropriate amount of a masterbatch. See Table II for operating conditions.

The amorphous samples fromExamples 34 41 were placed in a hot air oven at various temperatures 200 C., 175 C. and 1200C. for a period of 15 minutes. All amorphous samples resulted in distortion before subsequently being crystallized. Examples 43 44 As apparent from Table III, a cold mold was used to obtain amorphous plate samples Figs. 1 3 . These plates were successfully injection molded at mold temperatures of 43 C. to 510C. The molding pressure however was overridden with the boost pressure of 1800 kPa in order to fill the mold. This difficulty mold fill was not experienced using a hot mold. Typical total cycle times of 40 seconds and 20 seconds yielded amorphous parts. To evaluate heat distortion characteristics of these plates, amorphous plates were placed in a hot air oven empty at various temperatures 200 C., 175 C. and 1200C. for a period of 15 minutes. All amorphous samples distorted before subsequently being crystallized. TABLE IIIEMI27.1 tb EXAMPLE SEP NO.
