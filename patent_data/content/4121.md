Technical Field This invention relates to laundry detergent compositions which exhibit surprisingly effective removal of particulate soils, as well as fabric softening, static control, color fidelity i.e., the inhibition of the bleeding of fabric colors into the laundry solution , and dye transfer inhibition i.e., the inhibition of the redeposition of dyes in the laundry solution onto fabrics capabilities, even in the total absence of dye urgency builder materials. Specifically, completely unbuilt compositions of the present invention have demonstrated the ability to remove particulate soils from fabrics as well, and under some conditions better, than fully built conventional laundry detergents. Other detergent compositions which utilize mixtures of selected non ionic surfactants and cationic surfactants are defined in U.S.Patent Application Serial No. 919,181, Murphy, filed June 26, 1978, and the parent applications thereof and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 919,341, Cockrell, filed June 26, 1978, and the parent applications thereof, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Background Art Nonionic surfactants are generally utilized in laundry detergent compositions for their ability to remove greasy and oily, rather than particulate, soils from fabrics. Some types of cationic surfactants have been included in detergent compositions, primarily because they provide adjunct fabric care benefits, and not because they provide any cleaning advantage. Thus, certain cationic surfactants have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose uf yielding a germicidal or sanitization benefit to washed surfaces e.g., U.S. Patent No. 2,742,434, Kopp, issued April 17, 1956 U.S. Patent No. 3,539,520, Cantor et al, issued November 10, 1970 and U.S.Patent No. 3,965,026, Lancz, issued June 22, 1976. Other cationic materials, particularly those of the di long chain type have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose of providing a fabric softening benefit see U.S Patent No. 3,607,763, Salmen et al, issued September 21,1971, and U.S. Patent No. 3,644,203, Lamberti et al, issued February 22, 1972 , or a static control benefit seeU.S. Patent No. 3,951,879, Wixon, issued April 20, 1976, andU.S. Patent No. 3,959,157, Inamorato, issued May 25, 1976 . The relative insolubility of the di long chain quat ernary ammonium materials has led formulators of detergent compositions away from their inclusion for the purpose of yielding a cleaning or whiteness maintenance benefit this is particularly true in compositions, such as those des cribed herein, where the relatively low nonionic cationic ratios required preclude the use of large amounts of the nonionic surfactant to solubilize the cationic material. In fact, it is well known in the detergency art that the use of such di long chain cationic materials actually causes fab rics laundered with them to become yellow and dingy. See U.S.Patent No. 3,644,203, tamberti et al,issüéd February 22, 1972 U.S. Patent No. 3,360,470, Wixon issued December 26, 1967 U.S. Patent No. 3,676,341, Gerecht and Wixon, issued July 11, 1972 and U.S. Patent No. 3,904,359, Rama chandran, issued September 9, 1975, which teach ways of avoiding this yellowing problem caused by the di long chain cationics. The teachings of patents such as these makes the whiteness maintenance properties the present invention, which result from inhibiting the transfer of dyes in the wash solution, particularly surprising. The compositions of the present invention have out standing cleaning capabilities in terms of the removal of particulate soils. In laundry tests, these compositions not containing any builder components, have been shown to remove particulate soils such as clay as well, and in cases dramatically better, than fully built conventional laundry detergent compositions. The compositions are relatively insensitive to water hardness conditions, per forming well in both hard and soft water conditions. Finally, in addition to this cleaning performance, the present invention provides, in a single detergent product, fabric softening, static control, fabric color fidelity, arG dye transfer inhibition benefits to the laundered fabrics.This well rounded cleaning and fabric care performance is the result of a heretofore unrecognized cleaning potential of the selected di long chain cationic surfactants defined herein, when they are used in the presence of certain alcohol ethoxylate nonionic surfactants, within a narrow rage of nonionic cationic surractant ratios. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide low or no phosphate laundry detergent compositions which demonstrate outstanding particulate soil removal capabilities. It is another object of this invention to provide laundry detergent compositions, yielding excellent particu late soil removal, which may conveniently be produced in a variety of physical forms, such as liquid, solid, paste, granular, powder, or in conjunction with a carrier, such as a substrate. . It is a further object of this invention to provide a single composition which provides outstanding cleaning performance together with fabric softening, static control, color fidelity, and dye transfer inhibition benefits. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a process for laundering fabrics which yields exceptional particulate soil removal, over a range of water hardness i , condltions, using cationic and nonionic surfactant con taining detergent compositions. , 4j si L n Sutnmary of The Invention The present invention relates to low or no phosphate laundry detergent compositions, especially beneficial for the removal of particulate soils from fabrics, having a pH in the laundry solution of greater than about 7, containing no more than about 15 phosphate and no more than about ir silicate materials, and being substantially free of etho y lated cationic surfactants containing more than an average of about .10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of surfactant which comprise from about 5 to about 160 , by weight, of a surfactant mixture consisting essentially of a a nonionic surfactant having the formula R OC2H4 nOH wherein R is a primary alkyl chain containing an average of from about 10 to about b carbon atoms and n is an average of from about 2 to about 9, and having an HLB of from 5 to about 14, or a mixture of such surfactants and b a quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant having 2 chains which contain an average of from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms, or a mixture of such surfactants the ratio of said nonionic surfactant to said cationic surfactant being in the range of from about 2 1 to about 9 1. Disclosure of The Invention The compositions of the present invention comprise, by weight, from about 5 to about 100 , preferably from about 15 to about 90 , and most preferably from about 20 to about 80 , of a mixture of particularly defined nonionic and cationic surfactants in the ratios stated herein. Preferred compositions contain at least about 15 of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture and at least about 1 of the cationic component, itself, in order to assure the presence of a sufficient amount of both the cationic surfactant and the nonionic cationic mixture to provide the desired cleaning and fabric conditioning benefits. The compositions of the present invention contain the nonionic and cationic surfactants, defined hereinafter, within ratios of nonionic to cationic surfactant of from about 2 1 to about 9 1, preferably from about 3 1 to about 6.5 1, more preferably from about 3.5 1 to about 5.5 1 and most preferably from about 4 1 to about 5 1, in order to achieve the best particulate soil removal performance. In addition, by using ratios in the range of from about 3.5 1 to about 5.5 1, the static control performance of the compositions is not only excellent under typical laundering conditions, but is particularly impressive under stress conditions, such as relative humidity less than about 35 , which generally are very difficult conditions under which to obtain any static control benefits.Preferred compositions may also contain mixed nonionic surfactant systems, It is preferred that the compositions of the present invention are formulated so as to have a pH of at least about 7 in the laundry solution, at conventional usage concentrations, in order to optimize their overall cleaning performance, to aid in their manufacturing and processing, and to minimize the possibility of washing machine corrosion. Lower product pH s e.g., as low as 6 are acceptable, but preferably the composition is not buffered below 7. It is also preferred that the composition pH be at least about 7.1, especially when a halide, e.g., choride, cationic is used to avoid corrosion of the equipment used in making the composition.Also, a pH range of from 7.2 to about 8.0, which is strongly buffered, is desirable if the cationic material has a substantial level of unquaternized amine, for odor reasons.Alkalinity sources, such as potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, may be included in the compositions for this purpose. Some of the cationic nonionic systems of the present invention may attain optimum removal of greasy oily soils at higher pH s, while attaining optimum particulate soil removal at relatively lower pH s. In these systems, overall performance may be enhanced by varying the pH of the wash solution during the laundering process. Particularly preferred compositions have a pH of at least about 8 in the laundry solution, in order to optimize the removal of greasy oily and body soils.In addition to the higher pH in the laundry solution, these preferred compositions should also have the ability to maintain a pH in the laundry solution of from about 8 to 11 throughout the washing operation reserve alkalinity .Such a reserve alkalinity may be obtained by incorporating compounds which buffer at pH s of from about 8 to 11, such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine or triethanolamine. Preferred compositions of the present invention are also essentially free of oily hydrocarbon materials and solvents, such as mineral oil, paraffin oil and kerosene, since these materials, which are themselves oily by nature l ad the washing liquor with excessive oily material, t.lereby diminishing the cleaning effectiveness of the sor ositions . onionic Component The nonionic surfactants used in the compositions of the present invention are biodegradable and have the form R oC2H4 OH, wherein R is a primary alkyl chain containing an average of from about 10 to about 18, preferably froz about 10 to.about 16, carbon atoms, and n is an averaqe r from about 2 to about 9, preferably from about 2 to about 7 These nonionic surfactants have an HLB hydrophilic lipo philic balance of from about 5 to about 14, preferably from about 6 to about 13. HLB, an indicator of a surfactant s .ydrophilic or lipophilic nature, is defined in detail inNonionic Surfactants, by M.J.Schick, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1966, pages 607 613, incorporated herein by reference.

Preferred nonionic surfactant mixtures contain alkyl glyceryl ethers in addition to the required nonionic sur factant. Particularly preferred are glyceryl ethers having the formulaeEMI10.1 wherein R is an alkyl or alkenyl group of from about 8 to about 18, preferably about 8 to 12, carbon atoms or an alkaryl group having from about 5 to 14 carbon in the alkyl chain, and n is from 1 to about 6, together with the non ionic surfactant component of the present invention, in a ratio of nonionic surfactant to glyceryl ether of from about 1 1 to about 4 1, particularly about 7 3. Glyceryl ethers of the type useful in the present invention are disclosed inU.S. Patent Application Serial No. 904,656, Jones, filedMay 10, 1978 and its parent application,and U.S.Patent 4,098,713, Jones,t issued July 4, 1978, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Other nonionic surfactants well known in the detergency arts may be used, in combination with one or more of the required nonionic surfactants, to form useful nonionic surfactant mixtures. Examples of such surfactants are listed in U.S. Patent No. 3,717,630, Booffi, issued February 20, 1973, and U.S. Patent No. 3,332,880, Kessler et al, issued July 25, 1967, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.Nonlimiting examples of suitable nonionic surfactants which may be used in conjunction with the required nonionic surfactants, defined above, are polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols, such as theIgepal surfactants, marketed by the GAP Corporation, and he Triton surfactants, marketed by the Rohm and Haas Compan condensation products of aliphatic alcohols with from az 10 to about 25 moles of ethylene oxide, where those alcohols are of a primary, branched or secondary alkyl chain structure condensation products of ethylene oxide with a hydro phobic base formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol, such as the Pluronic surfactants, marketed by Wyandotte Chemical Corporation and condensation products of ethylene oxide with the product resulting from the reaction of propylene oxide and ethylene diamine, such as the Tetronic surfactants, marketed by Wyandotte ChemicalCorporation. A preferred group of nonionic surfactants useful herein comprises a mixture of surfactant and cosurfactant , containing at least one nonionic surfactant falling within the definition of the nonionic surfactants useful herein, as described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 001, 632,Collins, filed January 8, 1979, and its parent applications, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Another preferred mixture of nonionic surfactants comprises C12 13E06 5 and C1415EO7 in a ratio of 4 1 to 1 4. This mixture provides a desirable suds pattern during the wash and during rinsing as compared to either surfactant by itself. Preferred compositions of the present invention are substantially free of fatty acid polyglycol ether di ester compounds, such as polyethylene glycol 600 dioleate or polyethylene glycol 800 distearate. Such additives offer no advantage, and possibly even result in a disadvantage, in terms of achieving the particulate soil removal and fabric conditioning benefits provided by the present invention. Cationic Component The cationic surfactants used in the compositions of the present invention are of the di long chain quaternary ammonium type, having two chains which contain an average ci from about 16 to about 22, preferably from about 16 to abct 18, carbon atoms. The remaining groups, if any, attached to the quaternary nitrogen atom, are preferably C1 to C4 all or hydroxyalkyl groups. Although it is preferred that the long chains be alkyl groups, these chains may contain heteroatoms or other linkages, such as hydroxy groups, double or triple carbon carbon bonds, and ester, amide, or ether linkages, as long as each chain falls within the carbon atom ranges required given above.Preferred cationic surfactants are those having the formulaeEMI12.1 wherein the R1 and R2 groups contain an average of from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms, preferably as alkyl groups, and most preferably contain an average of from about 16 to about 18 carbon atoms, R3 and R4 are C1 to C4 alkyl or hydroxyaLkyl groups, arzdX is any compatible anion1.particu larly one selected from the group consisting of halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate, or acetate anions. Mixtures of the above surfactants are also useful in the present invention. These cationic surfactants may also be mixed with other types of cationic surfactants, such as sulfonium, phosphonium, and mono or tri lorg chain quaternary ammonium materials, as long as the amount of required cationic surfactant contained in the composition, falls with the nonionic cationic ratio requirements specified herein. Examples of cationic surfactants which may be used together with those required herein, include those described in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 919,181,Murphy, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 919,341,Cockrell, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 919,344,Letton, and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 919,343,Letton, all of which were filed on June 26, 1978, and their parent applications all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Preferred cationic surfactants include ditallowalksl dimethyl or diethyl or dihydroxyethyl ammonium chloride, ditallowalkyldimethylammonium methyl sulfate, dihexadecylalkyl C16 also known as distearyl dimethyl or diethyl, or dihydroxyethyl ammonium chloride, dioctadecylalkyl C18 dimethylammonium chloride, dieicosylalkyl C20 dimethylammonium chloride, methyl 1 tallowalkyl amido ethyl 2 tallowalkyl imidazolinium methyl sulfate commercially available as Varisoft 475 from AshlandChemical Company , or mixtures of those surfactants. articularly preferred cationic surfactants are ditallow alkyldimethylammoniwn chloride, ditallowalkyldimethylammonium methyl sulfate, methyl 1 tallowalkyl amido ethyl 2 tallowalkyl imidazolinium methyl sulfate, and mixtures of those surfactants, with ditallowalkyldimethylammonium chloride being especially preferred. Another particularly useful class of cationic surfactant is that in which the two long chains of the cationic surfactant contain a significant amount of unsaturation, such as where at least about 20 , preferably at least about 30 , of the long chains contain at least one double bond. By increasing the percentage of chains containing the double bonds, the performance benefits of these cationic materials are increased.Compounds of this type have the formulaEMI14.1 wherein R1 and R2 contain an average of from about 16 to about 22 most preferably from about 16 to about 18 carbon atoms, and at least about 20 of these chains contain at least one double bond R3 and R4 are C1 to C4 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl groups, and X is any compatible anion, particularly one selected from the group consisting of halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate anions.Thus, for example, a preferred cationic surfactant is di partially hydrogenated tallow dimethylammonium halide especially chloride or methyl sulfate , which is also known as di softened tallowalkyl dimethylammonium halide. A commercially available compound of this type is Adogen 470, sold by Ashland Chemical Company, wherein about 3uo of the tallow chains are oleyl in character.Another method of forming similar cationic materials is to synthesize a di oleyl quaternary ammonium compound and hydrogenate it to the level of unsaturation desired. Con positions made with these cationics show several significant advantages over those made with more conventional cationics such as ditallowalkyldimethylammonium chloride, only about 2 of the long chains of which contain double bonds particularly these compositions show improved particulate soil removal, especially at low wash temperatures, improved static control and remain in a stable single phase at temperatures down to about 400F. The cationics of this invention are preferably low in unquaternized amine content. If they contain more than about 1 unquaternized amine or amine salt the pH of the formula is desirably kept below about 8 to avoid the amine odor. Also, for odor reasons, it is preferable to use a solvent for the amine quaternization reaction which does not have an objectionable odor, e.g., a liquid nonionic detergent material, ethyl alcohol, etc. The compositions of the present invention must be formulated so as to be substantially free of ethoxylated cationic surfactants which contain more than an average of about 10, and preferably free of those which contain more than an average of about 7, moles of ethylene oxide per mole of surfactant. These compounds tend to be relatively non biodegradable, do not enhance the cleaning or fabric conditioning benefits provided by the compositions and may, in some circumstances, decrease the overall laundering performance provided by them.It is to be noted that polyethoxylated cationic surfactants having relatively low levels of ethoxylation, i.e., those with less than 10, and particularly less than 7, ethylene oxide groups exhibit better biodegradability characteristics and may be advantageously included in the compositions of the present invention. In particularly preferred embodiments of the present invention, the detergent compositions additionally contain from about 2 to about 25 , preferably from about 2 to about 16 , and most preferably from about 2 to about 10 of a fatty amide surfactant, such as ammonia amide e.g.,coconutalkyl ammonia amide, diethano amides, and ethoxylated amides . The amides are watersoluble or at least water dispersible. In relation to the nonionic cationic surfactant system, the ratio of the cationic nonionic mixture to the amide component in the composition is in the range of from about 5 1 to about 50 1, preferably from about 8 1 to about 25 1.The addition of the amide component results in a composition which exhibits improved antiredeposition of both clay nd greasy oily soils. This development is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Application Serial No.811,419, Cambre, filed June 29, 1977, and U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 919,340, Cambre, filed June 26, 1978, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.Preferred amides are C8 C20 monoethanol amides, C8 C20 diethanol amides, and amides having the formulaEMI17.1 wherein R is a C8 C20 alkyl group, and mixtures thereof.Particularly preferred amides are those where the alkyl group contains from about 10 to about 16 carbon atoms, such as coconut alkyl monoethanol or diethanol amide. Such compounds are commercially available under the tradenamesSuperamide GR, from Onyx Chemical Co., Jersey City, N.J.,Superamide F 3 from Ryco, Inc., Conshohocken, Pa., andGafamide CDD 518, available from GAF Corp., New York, N.Y. These amide components may also be added in small amounts, i.e., from about 2 to about 5 , to act as suds modifiers. Specifically, they tend to boost the sudsing in an active system which exhibits relatively low sudsing, and depress the sudsing in an active system which exhibits relatively high sudsing. The compositions of the present invention may also contain additional ingredients generally found in laundry detergent compositions, at their conventional art established levels, as long as these ingredients are compatible with the nonionic and cationic components required herein.For example, the compositions may contain up to about 15 , preferably up to about 5 , and most preferably from about 0.001 to about 2 , of a suds suppressor component. Typical suds suppressors useful in the compositions of the present Invention include, but are not limited to, those described below. Preferred silicone type suds suppressing additives are scribed in U.S. Patent 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976, artolotta et al., incorporated herein by reference. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types. The silicone material can be described as a siloxane having the formula EMI18.1 wherein x is from about 20 to about 2,000, and R and R are each alkyl or arvl groups, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and phenyl. Polydimethylsiloxanes R and R are methyl, having a molecular weight within the range of from about 200 to about 200,000, and higher, are all useful as suds controlling agents.Additional suitable silicone materials wherein the side chain groups R and R are alkyl, aryl, or mixed alkyl and aryl hydrocarbyl groups exhibit useful suds controlling properties. Examples of such ingredients include diethyl , dipropyl , dibutyl , methylethyl , phenylmethyl polysiloxanes and the like. Additional useful silicone suds controlling agents can be represented by a mixture of an alkylated siloxane, as referred to hereinbefore, and solid silica. Such mixtures are prepared by affixing the silicone to the surface of the solid silica.A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is represented by a hydrophobic silanated most preferably trimethylsilanated silica having a particle size in the range from about 10 millimicrons to 20 millimicrons and a specific surface area above about 50 mê gm intimately admixed with dimethyl silicone fluid having a molecular weight in the range from about 500 0 about 200,000 at a eight ratio of silicone to silanated silica of from about 19 1 to about 1 2. The silicone suds suppressing agent is advantageously releasably incorporated in a water soluble or water dispersible, substantially non surface active, detergent impermeable carrier. Particularly useful suds suppressors are the selfemulsifying silicone suds suppressors, described in U.S.Patent 4,136,045, Gault et al., issuedJanuary 23, 1979incorporated herein by reference. An example of such a compound is DB 544, commercially available from Dow Corning, which contains a siloxane glycol copolymer together with solid silica and a siloxane resin. Microcrystalline waxes having a melting point in the range from 350C 1150C and a saponification value of less than 100 represent additional examples of a preferred suds regulating component for use in the subject compositions, and are described in detail in U.S. Patent 4,056,481, Tate, issued November 1, 1977, incorporated herein by reference.The microcrystalline waxes are substantially water insoluble, but are water dispersible in the presence of organic surfactants. Preferred microcrystalline waxes have a melting point from about 650C to 1000C, a molecular weight in the range from 400 1,000 and a penetration value of at least 6, measured at 770F by ASTM D1321. Suitable examples of the above waxes include microcrystalline and oxidized microcrystalline petrolatum waxes Fischer Tropsch and oxidized Fischer Tropsch waxes ozokerite ceresin montan wax beeswax candelilla and carnauba wax. Alkyl phosphate esters represent an additional preferred suds suppressant for use herein. These preferred phosphate esters are predominantly monostearyl phosphate which, in addition thereto, can contain di and tristearyl phosphates and monoleyl phosphates, which can contain di and trioleyl phosphates. The alkyl phosphate esters frequently contain some trialkyl phosphate. Accordingly, a preferred phosphate ester can contain, in addition to the monoalkyl ester, e.g.monostearyl phosphate, up to about 50 mole percent of dialkyl phosphate and up to about 5 mole percent of trialkyl phosphate. Other adjunct components which may be included in the cam ositions of the present invention, in their convcntlonai art established levels for use i.e., from about 0 to about , include semi polar nonionic such as amine oxides , anionic, zwitterionic and npholytic cosurfactans detergency builders bleaching agents bleach activators soil release agents particularly copolymers of ethylene terephthalate and polyethylene oxide terephthalate, such asMilease T sold by ICI, United States, as disclosed in U.S.Patent Application Serial No. 895,682, Nicol, filed April 12, 1978, incorporated herein by reference soil suspending agents corrosion inhibitors dyes fillers optical brighteners germicides pH adjusting agents alkalinity sources hydrotropes enzymes enzyme stabilizing agents perfumes solvents carriers suds modifiers opacifiers and the like. However, because of the numerous and diverse performance advantages of the Present invention, certain conventional components, such as cosurfactants and detergency builders, as well as fabric softening and static control agents, will not generally be necessary in a particular formulation, giving the compositions of the present invention a potential cost advantage over conventional detergent softener compositions.In fact, because the compositions of the present invention give such outstanding clay removal performance, even in a builder free environment, and across the range of water hardness conditions, for environmental reasons the compositions of the present invention contain less than about 15 phosphate materials.Preferred compositions contain less than 7 phosphate, and may even be substantially, or totally free of such phosphate materials, without decreasing the performance of the composi tions. Further, in order to achieve optimal particulate soil removal performance, the compositions of the present invention contain less than 10 , and are preferably substantially free of, silicate materials.Preferred compositions of the present invention are also substantially free of carboxymethylcellulose in order to optimize the clay rgrnoval performance of the system. Finals, while the compositions of the present invention may contain änionic materials, such as anionic surfactants and hydrotropes e.g., alkali metal toluene sulfonates , it is preferred t iat particular anionic materials be contained in amounts suIficiently small such that not more than about 10 , preferably not more than about 5 , of the cationic surfactant, contained in the laundry solution, is complexed by the anionic material.Such a complexing of the anionic material with the cationic surfactant, decreases the overall cleaning and fabric conditioning performance of the composition.Suitable anionic materials may be selected based on their strength of complexation with the cationic material included in the composition as indicated by their dissociation constant . Thus, when an anionic material has a dissocia tion constant of at least about 1 x 10 3 such as sodium toluene sulfonate , it may be contained in an amount up to about 40 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant where the anionic material has a dissociation constant of at least about 1 x 10 5, but less than about 1 x 10 , it may be contained in an amount up to about 15 , by weight, of the cat ionic surfactant and where the anionic material has a dissociation constant of less than about 1 x 10 5 such as sodium C118 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate , it may be contained only in amounts up to about 10 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant. Preferred compositions are substantially free of such anionic materials. Examples of cosurfactants and detergency builders which may be used in the compositions of the present invention are found in U.S. Patent No. 3,717,630, Booth, issued February 20, 1973, and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 919,181,Murphy, filed June 26, 1978, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, these components, particularly the anionic surfactants, should be checked with the particular nonionic cationic surfactant system chosen, and used in an amount, so as to be certain that they will be compatible with the nonionic cationic surfactant system. Compositions of the present invention may contain from about 0.0u596 to about 38, preferably from about 0.01 to about 1 of an optical brightener. Nonionic brighteners are preferred because of their compatibility with the nonionic and cationic surfactants utilized herein. Suitable and preferred brighteners are disclosed in the copendingU.S. Patent Application of Lowell W. Bernardino and JosephMcGrady for BRIGHTENER CONTAINING LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS, Serial No. 003,567, filed January 15, 1979, said application being incorporated herein by reference.Nonionic brighteners include those of the coumarin and benzoxazole classes a particularly preferred brightener being 4 methyl 7 diethyl amino coumarin, commercially available under the tradename Tinopal SWN from Ciba GeigyCorp., Ardsley, N.Y., Hiltamine Arctic White SOL, available from Hilton Davis Chemical Co., Cincinnati, Ohio, andCalcofluor White SD, available from American Cyanamid,Wayne, N.J. Other brighteners useful herein include bis benzoxazol 2 yl triophenes, 1,2 bis benzoxazol 2 yl ethylenes, 1,4bis benzoxazol 2 yl naphthalenes, 4,4 bis benzoxazol 2 yl stilbenes, 2 styryl benzoxazoles, 2 styryl naphthoxazole, or 2 4 phenylstilben 4 yl 5tertbutyl benzoxazole. Preferred compositions of the present invention contain from about 0.05 to about 1.5 , preferably from about 0.05 to about and most preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.8 , of polyacids capable of forming water soluble calcium complexes, such as organo phosphonic acids, particularly alkylene polyamino polyalkylene phosphonic acids. These materials include ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid, hexamethylene diaminetetramethylene phosphonic acid, diethylene triaminepentamethylene phosphonic acid, and amino trimethylene phosphonic acid. Other preferred embodiments of the present invention include an alkaline proteolytic enzyme having an iso electric point of greater than about 8. The enzyme is present in an amount from 0.00I to about 2 , preferably from about 0.005 to about 0.85, especially from about 0.02 to about 0.2 , d are particularly useful when used in conjunction with ne polyacids, described above. The most preferred proteolytic lne preparations for use in this invention are derived prom bacillus subtilis, such as ALCALASE, manufactured by i8rVo Industri A S, and MAXATASE, manufactured by GistBrocades N.V. These most preferred enzyme species have an iso electric point in the range from about 8.5 to about 9.2. These polyacid and enzyme components, as well as the benefits they provide, are discussed in detail in U.S. atent 4,100,262, Arnau et al., issued August 29, 1978, and TU.S. Patent 4,111,855, Barrat et al., issued September 5, 1978, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.Compositions which include these components are particularly useful for the hand laundering of fine fabrics, such as WJol. The compositions of the present invention may be produced in a variety of forms, including liquid, solid, granular, paste, powder or substrate compositions.Preferred substrate articles may be formulated according to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 781,378, Flesher et al, filed March 25, 1977, incorporated herein by reference. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the compositions of the present invention are formulated as liquids and contain up to about 20 of a lower alkyl C1 to C4 alcohol, particularly ethanol. Liquid compositions containing lower levels of such alcohols i.e., about 7 to 12 tend to exhibit less phase separation than compositions containing higher alcohol levels. The compositions of the present invention are used in the laundering process by forming an aqueous solution containing from about 0.01 100 parts per million to about 0.38 3,000 parts per million , preferably from about 0.02 to about 0.2 , and most preferably from about 0.03 to about 0.15 , of the nonionic cationic detergent mixture, and agitating the soiled fabrics in that solution. The fabrics are then rinsed and dried. When used in this manner, the compositions of the present invention yield exceptionally good particulate soil removal, and also provide fabric softening, static control, color fide ity, and dye transfer inhibition to the laundered fabrics, without requiring the use of any of the other conventionally used fabric softening and or static control laundry additives. All percentages, parts, and ratios used herein are by weight unless otherwise specified. The following nonlimiting examples illustrate the compositions and the method of the present invention. EXAMPLE I The particulate soil removal performance of the present invention was tested against a built, commercially available heavy duty laundry detergent composition, in the manner described below. Composition A, a liquid composition of the present invention, was formulated by mixing together the components given below Control 1 is a more conventional granular detergent formulation. Composition AComponent Weight Neodol 23 6.51 28Ditallowalkyldimethylammonium 7 chlorideEthanol 15Water 50 1Condensation product of C12 13 alcohol, having about 20 2 methyl branching, with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide, commercially available from Shell Chemical Company.Control 1Component Weight Sodium salt of the sulfated 5.5 reaction product of tallow alcohol condensed with 3 moles of ethylene oxide Sodium Xalic al,vyl sulfate 5.5Sodium C1 8 linear alkylbenzene 7.0 sulfona Sodium silicate solids 2.0r 12.0Sodium tripolyphosphate, anhydrous 24.4Sodium sulfate 36.8Polyethyleneglycol 6000 0.9Moisture and minors balance to 100 includes perfume and brightener For each test, 3 cotton and 3 polyester fabric swatches were used. The swatches were stained with a slurry of clay in water the 6 swatches containing a total of about 1.5 grams of the clay material. For each treatment, the 6 swatches were run through one cycle which includes predissolve, wash, rinse, and spin steps of a 1.5 gallon capacity automatic mini washer.Composition A was used in the washer at a concentration of about 1800 parts per million an active concentration of 620 ppm , while Control 1 was used at a concentration of about 1,500 parts per million.The swatches were machine dried, and the particulate soil removal for each treatment was determined using a HunterWhiteness Meter. The results, given below, are in filteredHunter Whiteness Units, with higher numbers indicating better particulate removal. The above procedures were carried out using 1000F wash water containing 7 and 12 grains per gallon of mixed calcium and magnesium hardness, and using a wash temperature of 125 F, at a hardness of 7 grains per gallon.EMI25.1 tb Wash SEP water SEP temperature SEP 100 F SEP 100 SEP OF SEP 1250F tb Water SEP Hardness SEP grains gallon SEP 7 SEP 12 SEP 7 tb Polyester tb Composition SEP A SEP 57 SEP 56 SEP 69 tb Control SEP 1 SEP 32 SEP 25 SEP 26 tb least SEP significant SEP difference SEP 3 SEP 2 SEP 2 tb Cotton tb Composition SEP A SEP 45 SEP 47 SEP 53 tb EMI26.1 tb Control SEP 1 SEP SEP 40 SEP SEP 42 SEP 40 tb least SEP significant SEP difference SEP 4 SEP 1 SEP 2 tb These data demonstrate the superior particulate soil removal performance, over a range of wash temperature, water hardness and fabric conditions, of the compositions of the present invention when compared with a more conventional laundry detergent formulation. It must be emphasized thatComposition , a totally unbuilt composition, demonstrated these benefits, in spite of the fact that Control 1 contains significant amounts of phosphate builder materials. Similar cleaning results are obtained when the cationic surfactant in Composition A is replaced, in whole or in part, by ditallowa Ikyldimethylammonium methyl sulfate, ditallowalkyldimethylammoniumiodide, dihexadecylalkyl dimeth,zl monium chloride, dihexadecylalkyldihydroxylethyl ammonium methyl sulfate, dioctadecylalkyldimethylammonium chloride, dieicosylalkyl methyl ethyl ammonium chloride, dieicosylalkyl dimethylammonium bromide, methyl 1 tallowalkyl amido ethyl 2 tallowalkyl imidazolinium methyl sulfate, or mixtures of these surfactants. Substantially similar results are also obtained where the nonionic surfactant in Composition A is replaced, in whole or in part, by the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 2.25 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of C12 15 alcohol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of C12 13 alcohol with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide, which is stripped so as to remove lower ethoxylate and nonethoxylated fractions the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 6 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of C12 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide the condensation product of tallow alcohol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide a 1 1 by weight mixture of the condensation product of C12 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide and the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol wit 7 moles of ethylene oxide and other mixtures of those surfactants. Excellent cleaning results are also obtained where the ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant used inComposition A is about 2 1, 3 1, 3.5 1, 4.5 1, 5 1, 6 1 or EXAMPLE II The dye transfer inhibition properties of CompositionA of Example I were compared to those of a more conventional, built laundry detergent composition in the following manner. Control 2 C3mponent Weight Sodium salt of the sulfated 5.5 reaction product of tallow alcohol condensed with 3 moles of ethylene oxideSodium tallowalkyl sulfate 5.5Sodium C1 8 linear alkylbenzene 7.0 sulfonat Sodium silicate solids 2.Or 12.Q Sodium tripolyphosphate, anhydrous 24 4 Sodium Zeolite A, Hydrated 18.0 X3 average diameter Sodium sulfate 18.8Polyethyleneglycol 6000 0.9Moisture and minors balance to 100 includes perfume and brightener While a full size automatic washing machine was filling with 100 F water, having a mixed calcium magnesium hardness of 7 grains per gallon, the detergent compositions were added to the wash solution.In one set of runs, CompositionA was used at a level of 1400 parts per million an active concentraticn of 500 ppm , while in the second set of runsControl 2 was used at a concentration of about 1500 parts per million. After the washing machine was filled with water, four white cotton terry fabrics and one piece 9 x 20 of navy blue sweatshirt were added to the wash solution. After one complete washing cycle, the fabrics ere removed and dried. Upon visual inspection it was seen that while the fabrics washed with Composition A were still white, those was led in Control 2 had a noticeable blue tinge. To confirm these visual results, a Hunter Whiteness Meter was used to determine the b value of the launder fabrics. This ib value indicates the amount of blue color in the fabric with 0 indicating no blue color present, and increasingly negative numbers denoting increasing amounts of blue color in the fabric. On two runs with Composition A, the Hunter b readings were 0 on each run. However, on two runs usingControl 2, Hunter b readings of 4 and 5, indicating a definite presence of blue color in the fabrics, were obtained.These data demonstrate that Composition A, a composition of the present invention, was able to inhibit the transfer 4f dye from th2 bltie sweaLsirirt fabric onto the white cotton terry fabrics, while Control 2, a more conventional laundry detergent composition, was not able to effectively do so. EXAMPLE III Using the method described in Example II, the dye transfer inhibition properties of a composition of the present invention were tested against a similar composition which included a mono long chain quaternary ammonium surfactant, rather than the required di long chain quaternary ammonium surfactant. Before the test procedu was begun, the white cotton terry fabrics used were found to have a Hunter Whiteness b value of 0.78. One set of terries was washed using Composition A, of Example I, at a usage concentration of about 1400 parts per million, while a second set of cotton terries was washed in a similar composition containing a mixture ofNeodol 23 6.5 and tallowalkyltrimethylammonium chloride, in a nonioniczcationic ratio of 4 1, at a usage concentration of about 1400 parts per million. After washing in the presence of the blue sweatshirt naterial and drying, the terries washed with Composition A were found to have a Hunter Whiteness b value of 0.79 a value essentially equivalent to the value of the terries prior to the wash.The terries washed with the tallowalkyltrimethylammonium chloride composition were found to have a Hunter Whiteness b value of 2.13. These data demonstrate that the compositions of the present invention, which utilize di long chain quaternary ammonium materials, offer a dye transfer inhibition benefit which is far superior to that offered by similar mixtures of nonionic and cationic surfactants, which utilize a conventional mono long chain quaternary ammonium surfactant of similar chain length. EXAMPLE IV The static control benefits of a liquid detergent composition of the present invention, having the specific formulation given below, were demonstrated in the following manner. The composition was formulated by combining the ingredients in the proportions stated.Component Weight Neodol 23 6.5 28Ditallowalkyldimethylammonium 7 chlorideSodium toluene sulfonate 2Ethanol 15Water 48 A load of clothing was washed in a full size washing machine, using the composition given above at a usage concentration of about 1400 parts per million in 22 gallons of 1000F water, having a hardness of about 7 grains per gallon. The composition had a pH of about 8 in the laundry solution. The load consisted of about 33 pieces of clothing and contained cotton, polyester cotton, nylon and polyester materials. The washed load was subsequently placed in an automatic dryer, the drum of which had been cleaned with an alcohol soaked cloth, and dried for a period of 60 minutes. The fabric load was then removed from the dryer and placed in a grounded Faraday Cage.The overall charge reading of the materials in the Faraday Cage was read and recorded as individual items were removed from the Cage.When all the fabrics had been removed, the total voltage charge for the fabric load could be determined. This value was then divided by the total area of the fabric load 18.5 sq. yds. to determine the oltage per square yard of the load. The composition, described above, gave a voltage per square yard reading of 0.95, with no individual clings of fabrics observed as they were removed from the Faraday Cage.Conventional laundry detergent compositions, tested in the same manner, generally give voltage per square yard readings of between about 4 and 10 volts per square yard, with numerous individual clings being observed, depending upon the relative humidity at the time the test is carried out. Thus, it is seen that the compositions of the present invention give excellent static control performance when compared to conventional laundry detergent compositions.

In addition, the composition provides benefits ver similar compositions utilizing more conventional cationic components, such as ditallowalkyldimethylammonium chloride, in terms of improved static control and particulate soil removal especially at lower wash temperatures3 and better processing characteristics, in that it forms a single phase product which remains stable at lower storag e temperatures.
