# SEMICONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
Semiconductor integrated circuit which has first and second semiconductor regions which are formed in pillar like projections provided on a semiconductor substrate or a semiconductor layer provided on an insulating substrate, the semiconductor regions opposing each other across an insulating region a p channel FET provided in the first semiconductor region and an n channel FET provided in the second semiconductor region, each of the FETs having source and drain regions at the upper and bottom portions respectively of the corresponding semiconductor region and a gate electrode at a side portion of the semiconductor region. Also disclosed is a semiconductor integrated circuit in which the insulating region between the semiconductor regions in the shape of a pillarlike projection is employed as a gate electrode and a gate insulating film.
