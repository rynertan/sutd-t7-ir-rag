## Description
Recombinant DNA technology has made it possible to express genes of one organism within another. The prior art shows that several virus groups including the papovaviruses, papilloma viruses, adenoviruses, and retroviruses have been employed as eukaryotic molecular cloning and expression vectors. The relatively small sizes of these virus genomes have facilitated the Since vaccinia virus is the best studied member of the poxvirus group, it will be described here. Vaccinia virus has a very broad host range References which relate to the present invention are Venkatesan Panicali and Paoletti, PNAS USA 79 4927 4931 1982 , describe donor or insertion vectors for the preparation of recombinant vaccinia virus. The vectors comprise the vaccinia Hind III F fragment into which, at the BamHI site, the thymidine kinase gene from herpes simplex virus HSV TK has been inserted cf. pDP132 and pDP137 in Figure 1 . The HSV TK gene contains the gene s own regulatory signals page 4927, column 1, lines 15 16 . The document states that, although results obtained from transcription analysis might be interpreted to mean that the regulatory signals of the Weir According to the present invention, a plasmid, cosmid or phage vector which can undergo homologous recombination in a poxvirus, comprises When the foreign gene is an appropriate one from a pathogen, the recombinant poxvirus can serve as a live vaccine. Some examples of such foreign genes include DNA genes or DNA copies of RNA genes from hepatitis B virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis non A, non B virus, influenza virus, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, adenoviruses, parvoviruses, foot and mouth disease virus, poliovirus, measles virus, rabies virus, coronaviruses, coxsackieviruses and pathogenic bacteria, rickettsia, protazoa, and metazoa. In accordance with the present invention, cells infected with poxvirus recombinants are also used to prepare the foreign gene product. In considering the development of vaccinia virus or other poxviruses as infectious expression vectors, the following biological characteristics of these agents were taken into account evidence that vaccinia virus has evolved its own transcriptional regulatory sequences its large genome size and lack of infectivity of isolated viral DNA. With the present invention, efficient expression of foreign DNA is obtained by forming chimeric genes consisting of a poxvirus transcriptional regulatory sequence and an uninterrupted protein coding sequence of a foreign gene. The poxvirus transcriptional regulatory sequence consists of a DNA segment that precedes and may include the site at which RNA synthesis begins. In the description which follows, sequences that positively regulate the transcription of a gene may be referred to as a promoter. The foreign gene protein coding sequence includes the site corresponding to initiation of translation and will be referred to hereinafter as the foreign gene. By using the translational initiation site of the foreign gene in accordance with the present invention, codon phasing and potential problems associated with the biological activity of fusion proteins are avoided. The chimeric gene is flanked by DNA from a known non essential region of the poxvirus genome that will ultimately allow homologous recombination to occur. The present invention thus provides a general method of expressing foreign genes, in that plasmids can be constructed that contain multiple restriction endonuclease sites next to the poxvirus promoter and that contain the flanking poxvirus DNA as well as the plasmid origin of replication and antibiotic resistance gene. The plasmids are then cleaved with an appropriate restriction endonuclease to form ligatable termini, and a foreign gene with complementary termini is ligated next to the poxvirus promoter. The plasmid containing the chimeric gene and flanking poxvirus DNA is used to transform bacteria and then is purified from the transformed bacteria. The plasmid containing the chimeric gene flanked by poxvirus DNA is then used in accordance with the present invention under transfecting conditions to transfect cells that have been infected with vaccinia virus or another compatible poxvirus. Homologous recombination and replication are allowed to occur, whereupon the chimeric gene is inserted into the poxvirus genome at the position specified by the flanking DNA used. It is important to use flanking DNA from a non essential region of the genome so that infectivity will not be destroyed. Recombinant poxvirus provided by the present invention is distinguishable from the original virus by a variety of methods. For example, by using segments of the vaccinia virus thymidine kinase TK gene as flanking DNA, the chimeric gene can be inserted into the thymidine kinase gene within the vaccinia virus and thereby interrupt its function. Thus, if the flanking DNA is from the TK gene of vaccinia virus, then virus recombinants lacking TK activity can be selected. Alternatively, virus can be distinguished either by DNA DNA hybridization, by detection of the product of the foreign gene, or by other selective procedures. The following description of this invention will be divided into the following sections Throughout the following description, manipulations of vaccinia virus DNA, such as, for example, the locating of the thymidine kinase gene in the vaccinia viral genome, are detailed as exemplary of those readily applicable to poxvirus generally. Accordingly, it is understood that the examples presented herein are illustrative only, and that various changes and modifications within the scope of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The vehicle used to assemble the insertion vector may be any convenient plasmid, cosmid, or phage. Examples of phages which can be used in accordance with the invention are the lambda and M13 phages. An exemplary cosmid which can be used is designated pHC79 and is described by Hohn and Collins, Either directly or after modification of its ends, the promoter segment was ligated to a plasmid that had been cleaved with a restriction endonuclease to provide compatible ligatible termini. Ligation of cohesive or blunt ends followed standard procedures. Additional restriction endonuclease sites were placed next to the promoter by inserting the promoter into a plasmid such as pUC9 that already has multiple insertion sites however, ligation of synthetic polynucleotides is also possible. The plasmid containing the promoter was used to transform bacteria and then was purified. Restriction endonucleases were used to excise the promoter with adjacent restriction endonuclease sites, and the resultant DNA fragment was purified using conventional methods. The DNA used to flank the promoter and added restriction endonuclease sites was derived from a non essential region of the vaccinia virus genome. Examples of such non essential regions include the thymidine kinase gene Weir, Bajszar and Moss, A segment of DNA containing a foreign gene or a cDNA copy of a foreign gene was obtained. The DNA segment was cleaved with restriction endonucleases at a site preceding the translational initiation codon and distal to the end of the protein coding sequences. When appropriate sites were not present, then it was necessary to cleave beyond the desired site and use an exonuclease such as The plasmid constructed in part I of this section was cleaved at a restriction endonuclease site next to the promoter. The protein coding segment of the foreign gene was ligated directly to the promoter, when it had complementary termini, or after modification of its ends. The plasmid was used to transform bacteria and then was purified. When the foreign gene was insertable in more than one orientation, it was necessary to analyze by restriction endonuclease digestion and gel electrophoresis or nucleotide sequencing to check that the proper one was obtained. The desired plasmid had the promoter adjacent to the start of the foreign gene. Plasmids containing chimeric genes flanked by DNA from non essential regions of the vaccinia virus genome were used to transfect cells that were already infected with vaccinia virus. The chimeric gene was inserted into the vaccinia virus genome by homologous recombination. Typically, confluent monolayers of CV 1, BSC 1, TK 143, or other cells in bottles with a 25 cm² bottom surface area were infected with 0.01 to 0.05 plaque forming units pfu per cell of vaccinia virus. Approximately 1 µg of plasmid DNA with or without 1 µg of vaccinia virus DNA and 20 µg of calf thymus DNA or other carrier DNA was mixed in 1 ml of 0.1 dextrose, 0.14 M NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM Na₂HPO₄, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.05 and precipitated by addition of CaCl₂ to a final concentration of 125 mM. The mixture was agitated gently and allowed to remain at room temperature for about 45 min. Two hr after infection, 0.8 ml of the fine suspension was added to an infected monolayer from which medium had been removed. After 30 min, 8 ml of Eagle or other tissue culture medium containing 8 fetal bovine serum was added to each bottle and the incubation was continued at 37 C for 3.5 more hr. At 6 hr after infection, fresh medium containing 8 fetal bovine serum was added and incubation was continued for 48 hr. At this time, the infected cells were scraped off the bottle, centrifuged, resuspended in tissue culture medium and homogenized to break the cells and liberate virus. Virus from transfected cells consisted of a population of which only a small percentage were recombinants. A variety of selective and non selective methods were used to isolate these recombinants. Selective procedures depended on the ability of recombinants to replicate under conditions that inhibited the original virus. One selective method involved the inactivation of the vaccinia virus TK gene. This was achieved by using DNA from the vaccinia virus TK gene to flank the chimeric gene. When homologous recombination occurred, the chimeric gene was inserted into the TK gene of virion DNA and the recombinants exhibited a TK negative TK phenotype. Selective conditions for isolation of TK vaccinia virus was achieved by plaguing the virus in monolayers of TK negative cells such as TK 143 cells with 25 µg ml of 5 bromodeoxyuridine BUdR in the 1 low melting agar overlay. After 48 to 72 hr at 37 C in a 5 Co₂ humidified atmosphere, plaques were detected by staining with 0.005 neutral red. Typically, more than 30 of the TK plaques consisted of recombinants and the remainder were spontaneous TK mutants of vaccinia virus. A second selective method was used when TK cells were infected with TK mutants of vaccinia virus and then transfected with plasmids that contained a chimeric herpes virus TK gene. The TK mutants of vaccinia virus were obtained by infecting TK 143 cells with vaccinia virus in the presence of 25 g ml of BUdR. The TK negative mutants were then plaqued at least 2 times in succession in TK 143 cells in the presence of BUdR. Recombinants expressing herpesvirus TK were selected by plaque assay on TK 143 cells with a 1 low melting agar overlay containing Eagle medium and 8 fetal bovine serum, 100 µM thymidine, 50 µM adenosine, 50 µM guanosine, 10 µM glycine, 1 µM methotrexate. After 48 to 72 hr at 37 C in a 5 CO₂ humidified atmosphere, the plaques were detected by staining with neutral red. Non selective methods that depend on identification of virus plaques that contain the foreign gene were also used. In addition, such methods were used to confirm the identity of recombinants even after isolation by selective methods. DNA DNA hybridization was used to identify plaques formed by recombinant virus. One method was referred to as dot blot hybridization. In this procedure, virus obtained following transfection of infected cells with chimeric plasmids was plaqued on cell monolayers with a 1 agar overlay. After 48 to 72 hr, the plaques were detected by staining with neutral red. Virus within individual plaques were picked using a sterile Pasteur pipette and used to infect cell monolayers in 16 mm diameter wells of microtiter dishes. After 48 hr incubation at 37 C, the cells were scraped, lysed by three freeze thaw cycles, and collected on nitrocellulose sheets by filtration using a micro sample manifold Schleicher and Schuell, NH . The filter was washed with 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , blotted three times on successive Whatman 3 MM papers saturated with 1 0.5 M NaOH, 2 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.5 , and 3 2 X SSC SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate , baked at 80 C for 2 hr and then incubated with 5 X Denhardt s solution Denhardt, Additional methods that depend on expression of the foreign gene were also used to identify plaques. Plaques containing recombinant virus were then identified by autoradiography. When the herpesvirus thymidine kinase was expressed, recombinant plaques were detected by incorporation of ¹²⁵I deoxycytidine 1 µCi ml in the presence of 20 µg ml of tetrahydrouridine from 14 to 48 hr after infection. After identification of vaccinia virus recombinants, 2 or more successive plaque purifications were carried out to obtain pure recombinant virus. Susceptible cells such as BSC 1, HeLa, MRC 5, or others were infected to obtain large stocks of recombinant virus. The titers of the stocks were determined by serial dilution and plaque assay. To express the foreign gene, cells were infected with 1 to 30 pfu cell of crude or purified virus and incubations were carried out at 37 C for up to 48 hr. The foreign gene product, depending on its nature was found in the cell culture medium or within the cells. When present in the cells, it was liberated by one of a number of methods including sonication, freeze thawing, homogenization, or detergent treatment. The foreign protein was detected by immunological, enzymatic, and electrophoretic methods. For infection of animals, recombinant virus was introduced intradermally, although other routes should be satisfactory. Formation of antibodies to the product of the foreign gene indicated that the foreign protein was made and was immunogenic. In order to demonstrate the subject invention, we made several vectors containing vaccinia virus promoters that can be used for insertion of foreign protein coding sequences to form chimeric genes. Protein coding sequences from other DNA viruses, RNA viruses and prokaryotes were inserted into the plasmids. Vectors containing the chimeric genes then were used to transfect vaccinia virus infected cells, and the recombinant virus was isolated by selective methods. Expression of the foreign genes was demonstrated in each case. Many of the routine procedures employed are described in detail by MANIATIS et al., 50 µg of a plasmid containing a Human TK 143 cells were infected with 0.01 pfu cell of a vaccinia virus TK mutant TK 13 Bajszar 50 µg of pJS223 a plasmid containing a cDNA copy of VSV N gene, Sprague CV 1 cell monolayers were infected with purified wild type WT or vaccinia virus recombinants vHBs 1 5 at 30 plaque forming units pfu cell or mock infected. At 2 hr, virus inoculum was replaced with 2.5 ml of Eagle medium containing 2.5 fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested at 24 hr and separated from culture medium by centrifugation at 2,000 X g for 5 min. Cell pellets wee suspended in 2.5 ml of phosphate buffered saline, frozen and thawed 3 times and sonicated. Equal portions of cell extracts and culture medium were tested for HBsAg by radioimmunoassay and for vaccinia virus by plaque assay in CV 1 cells. Culture medium and a cell extract prepared as above from a hepatoma cell line PLC PRF 5 three days after confluency were tested in parallel for HBsAg. Undiluted serum, obtained from rabbits on the days indicated, was tested for antibody to HBsAg by a radioimmunoassay procedure AUSAB, Abbot Laboratories . An HBsAg positive control human plasma supplied by Abbot Laboratories had a titer of 512 RIA units.
