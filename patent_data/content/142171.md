# Frequency comparing circuit.

## Abstract
According to a frequency comparing circuit of the present invention, there is provided a negative switched capacitor circuit 10 having negative equivalent resistance, the value of which is determined according to the reference frequency and the frequency to be compared, and a positive switched capacitor circuit 20 having positive equivalent resistance, the value of which is determined according to the reference frequency. A constant DC voltage V is supplied in parallel to one terminal of the two switched capacitor circuits. The respective terminals of the switched capacitor circuits are commonly connected in order to produce the composite cur rent of both output currents of the two switched capacitor circuits. The composite current is integrated by an integrator 30 . Further, there is provided a Schmitt type oscillating cir cuit 83 . The oscillating frequency signal from the Schmitt type oscillating circuit is supplied to the negative switched capacitor circuit. The higher level threshold voltage V
