# Fuel injection valve drive circuit.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a fuel injection valve drive circuit for use in an internal combustion engine wherein the ex citation current supplied to the fucl injection valve wind ing 32 is controlled on a feedback basis so as to maintain the specified value during the period of the valve opening command signal. A control signal based on the difference between the signal representing the excitation current and the reference signal is produced and the excitation current is controlled by the pulse width modulation signal which is produced based the magnitude of the control signal.
