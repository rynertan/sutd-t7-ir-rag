## Abstract
A control valve comprising a vertical tubular yoke 1 having a bottom wall, a solenoid 3 mounted on the upper end of the yoke 1 for giving a force of attraction the magnitude of which is in proportion to the value of input current, the solenoid 3 having an operating rod 2 directed downward and movable longitudinally thereof by the force of attraction, a valve body 4 connected to the bottom wall of the yoke 1 , a valve stem 5 vertically movably supported by the valve body 4 and having an upper portion extending upward from the valve body 4 into the yoke 1 , and conversion means 2 housed in the yoke 1 for converting the force of attraction acting on the operating rod 2 to a displacement of the valve stem 5 .
