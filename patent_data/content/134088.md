# Treatment of viscous crude oil.

## Abstract
Asphaltenes and or wax and or water are removed from crude oil 1 by contacting 2 the crude oil with an organic solvent 3, 7 to dissolve the crude oil and precipitate asphaltenes and or wax and separate the oil 5 and water 4 . Solvent 11 is then separated from the deaspalted and or dewaxed and or dehy drated crude oil 12 . Removing asphaltenes, wax and or water reduces the viscosity of the crude oil and it can then be trans ported, eg by pumping through a pipeline, with less expenditure of energy.
