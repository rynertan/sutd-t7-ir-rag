# ADSORBENT PROCESSING TO REDUCE HYDROCARBON BASESTOCK FOAMING

## Abstract
A method for decreasing the foaming tendency of hydro carbons, particularly lube basestocks, comprises passing the hydrocarbon through an adsorption zone 30 having as adsor bent 32 , preferably a basic adsorbent. In a preferred embodi ment, the method comprises passing the hydrocarbon feed stock through a regenerable multi bed adsorption zone. The foaming tendency of the hydrocarbon exiting from the bed 32 in service is monitored. The flow to each particular bed 32 in service is discontinued and the bed 22 regenerated when the foaming tendency of the hydrocarbon exiting from each par ticular bed exceeds a predetermined value.
