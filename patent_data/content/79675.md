## Description
OXAZOLIDINEDIONE DERIVATIVES This invention relates to new oxazolidinedione derivatives of interest to those in the field of medicinal chemistry and chemotnerapy. more particularly, it is concerned with a novel series of sDiro oxindole oxazolidinedione compounds for the control of certain chronic complications arising from diabetes mellitus e.g., diabetic cataracts, retinopathy and neuropathy . Past attempts to obtain new and better oral antidiabetic agents have, for the most part, involved an endeavor to lower blood sugar levels.However, little is known about the effect or organic compounds in preventing or arresting certain chronic complications of diabetes, such as diabetic cataracts, neuropathy and retinopathy, etc. Nevertheless,K. Sestanj et al. in U.S. Patent No. 3,821,383 do disclose that certain aldose reductase inhibitors like l,3 dioxo lH benztd,e isoguinoline 2 3H acetic acid and some closely related derivatives thereof are useful for these purposes even though they are not known to be hypoglycemic. These compounds function by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme aldose reductase, which is primarily responsible for catalyzing the reduction of aldoses like glucose and galactose to the corresponding polyols such as sorbitol and galactitol in the human body.In this way, unwanted accumulations of galactitol in the lens of galactosemic subjects and of sorbitol in the lens, retina, peripheral nervous system and kidney of diabetic subjects are thereby prevented or reduced. As a result, these compounds control certain chronic diabetic complications, including those of an ocular nature, since it is already known in the art that the presence of polyols in the lens of the eye leads to cataract torr.a,ion and concomitant loss of lens clarity. The present invention relates to novel spirooxindole oxazolidinedione compounds useful In therapy as aldose reductase inhibitors for the control of certain chronic complications arising in a diabetic subject.More specifjcally, the novel compounds of this invention are selected from the group consisting of spirooxindole oxazolidinedione derivatives o the formula EMI2.1 and the base salts thereof with pharmacologically acceptable cations, wherein X and Y are each hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, nitro or amino Z is hydrogen or amino, with the proviso that Z is hydrogen when at least one of X and Y is other than hydrogen andR is hydrogen, alkyl having from one to four carbon atoms, aryl or aralkyl having up to three carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety wherein each of said aryl moieties is naphthyl, pyridyl, furyl, thienyl, phenyl, monosubstituted phenyl or di substituted phenyl, and each ring substituent is fluorine, chlorine, bromine, alkyl having up to four carbon atoms, alkoxy having up to four carbon atoms or trifluoromethyl, with the proviso that said R is always other than hydrogen or alkyl or phenylalkyl when each of said k, Y and Z is hydrogen.These novel compounds are aldose reductase inhibitors and therefore, possess the ability to reduce or inhibit sorbitol accumulation in the lens and peripheral nerves of diabetic subjects. Of especial interest in this connection are such typical and preferred member compounds of the invention as l E flunrophenyl 5 luoro spiro tindoline 3,5 oxazolidine 2,2 ,4 trione, l methyl 5 chloro spiro indoline 3,5 oxazolidine 2,2 ,4 trione, 1 isopropyl 5 chloro spiro indoline 3, 5 oxazolidFne 2, 2 , o trione and l E chlorobenzyl 5 chloro spiro tindoline 3,5 oxazolidine 2,2 ,41 trione, respectively. These particular compounds are highly potent as regards their aldose reductase inhibitory activity. In accordance with the process employed for preparing the novel compounds of this invention, an appropriately substituted isatin starting material of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein X, Y, Z and R are each as previously defined, is 1 reacted with a lower trialkylsilyl cyanide, such as trimethylsilyl.cyanide, to form the corresponding 3 cyano 3 trialkylsilyloxy derivative, followed by treatment with alcoholic hydrogen chloride to yield the desired hydroxy ester which, in turn, is then 2 subjected to the action of chiorosulfonyl isocyanate in tetrahydrofuran and subsequent reductive hydrolysis to yield the corresponding urethane ester, followed by 3 cyclization of the latter ester under non acidic conditions to ultimately aford the desired spirooxindole oxazolidinedione final product of the structural formula previously indicated. The last step of the process is preferably conducted under basic conditions, using a basic catalyst such as potassium carbonate and preferably employing even more strongly basic catalysts such as sodium methoxide or potassium tertiary butoxide. Suitable solvents for the reaction include reaction inert organic solvents such as dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane, dimethyl formalize and the like.In this way, for example, 1 p chlorobenzyl 5 chloroisatin is converted via l chloro benzyl 3 hydroxy 3 carbethoxy 5 chloroindoline 2 one and l p chlorobenzyl 3 carbamyloxy 3 carbethoxy 5 chloroindoline 2 one, respectively, to l D chloro benzyl 5 chloro spiro indoline 3,5 oxazolidine 2,2 ,4 trione. Compounds of the invention where X and Y are each hydrogen and Z is amino are best prepared by the alkylation of sodio ethyl oxazolidinedione 5carboxylate with 2,4 dinitrochlorobenzene, followed by reductive cyclization in a conventional manner. Moreover, compounds of the invention whereX and Y are both halogen as previously defined andZ is hydrogen may alternatively and preferably be prepared from the corresponding unsubstituted compounds wherein at least one of X and Y is hydrogen by means of direct halogenation techniques well known to those skilled in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. Additionally, these same monohalo starting materials e.g., where X is halogen and Y and Z are both hydrogen can be converted to the corresponding compounds whereY is nitro and amino, etc., by conventional procedure well known to those skilled in the art e.g., nitration and subsequent reduction, etc. The ketone starting materials i.e., carbonyl ring compounds required for preparing the 3 cyano 3trialkylsilyloxy derivatives used as intermediates in the first step of the overall process of this invention are, for the most part, known compounds and are either readily available commercially, like isatin 2,3indolinedione , l methylisatin, l benzylisatin, 5 fluoroisatin and 5 chloroisatin, etc., or else they can easily be synthesized by those skilled in the art starting from common chemical reagents and using conventional methods of organic synthesis.For instance, the l alkyl 5 haloisatins are easily obtained by alkylating 5 f luoro or 5 chloroisatin with the appropriate alkyl halide of choice in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, while the corresponding l D halophenylj 5 haloisatins are best synthesized by treatment of the appropriate 4,4 dihalophenylamine compound with oxalyl chloride, followed by ring closure with aluminum chloride in the usual manner. In either case, the ultimate starting materials are both readily derived from commercially available compounds. Inasmuch as the spiro oxindole oxazolidinedione compounds of this invention all possess one ass metric center, they may exist in separated d and l optic2lly active forms, as well as in racemic or dl mixtures. The present invention includes all these forms. For instance, an optically active isomer may be obtained by simply resolving the racemic mixture via the use of standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., by fracti9na crystallization of a stiro oxindole oxazolidinedione salt derived from an optimally active base. Alternatively, the optically active isomers may be prepared by using the appropriate enantiomers as starting materials in the foregoing series of reactions. The chemical bases which are used as reagents in this invention to prepare the aforementioned pharmaceutically acceptable base salts are those which form non toxic salts with the herein described acidic spirooxindole oxazolidinedione compounds, such as 1 chlorobenzyl 5 chioro spiro jindole 3, 5 oxazolidine 2,2 ,4 trione, for example. These particular non toxic base salts include those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, etc.These salts can easily be prepared by simply treating the aforementioned spiro oxindole oxazolidinedione compounds with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmacologically acceptable cation, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness while preferably being placed under reduced pressure.Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum production of yields of the desired final product. As previously indicated, the spiro oxindole oxazolidinedione compounds of this invention are readily adapted to therapeutic use as aldose reductase inhibitors for the control of chronic diabetic complications, in view of their ability to reduce lens sorbitol levels in diabetic subjects to a statistically significant degree. For instance, l U chlorobenzyl 5 chloro spiro indole 3,5 oxazolidine 2,2i,4 trione, a typical and preferred agent of the present invention, has been found to inhibit the formation of sorbitol levels in diabetic rats to a significantly high degree when give by the oral route of administration at dose levels ranging from 0.5 mg. kg. to 20 mg. kg.Furthermore, the herein described compounds of this invention can be administered by either the oral or parenteral routes of administration. In general, these compounds are ordinarily administered in dosages ranging from about 0.10 mg. to about 10 mg. per kg. of body weight per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen. In connection with the use of the stiro oxindole oxazolidinedione compounds of this invention for the treaumen of diabetic subjects, it is to be noted that these compounds may be administered either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers by either of the routes previously indicated, and that such administration can be carried out in either single or multiple dosages.More particularly, the compounds of this invention can be administered in a wide variety of different dosage forms, i.e., they may be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the crm of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hard candies, powders, sprays, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like.Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non toxic organic solvents. In general, the compounds of the invention will be present in such dosage forms at concentration levels ranging from about 0.5Q to about 90 by weight of the total composition to provide the desired unit dosage. For purposes of oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin and acacia.Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules preferred materials in this connection would also include the high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and if so desired, emulsifying and or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof. For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions of these spiro oxindole oxazolidinediones in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol or N,N dimethylformamide may be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding watersoluble, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts previously enumerated. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes.In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Additionally, it is also possible to aaminister the aforesaid spirooxindole oxazolidinedione compounds topically via an appropriate ophthalmic solution applied dropwise to the eye. The activity of the compounds of the present invention, as agents for the control of chronic diabetic complications, is determined by their ability to successfully pass one or more of the following standard biological or pharmacological tests, viz., 1 measuring their ability to inhibit the enzyme activity of isolated aldose reductase 2 measuring their ability to reduce or inhibit sorbitol accumulation in the sciatic nerve of acutely streptozotocinized i.e., diabetic rats 3 measuring their ability to reverse already elevated sorbitol levels in the sciatic nerve and lens of chronic streptozotocin induced diabetic rats 4 measuring their ability to prevent or inhibit galactitol formation in the lens of acutely galactosemic rats, and 5 measuring their ability to delay cataract formation and reduce the severity of lens opacities in chronic gal√Öactosemic rats.
