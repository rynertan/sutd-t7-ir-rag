# A method of heat treating polyester film.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method for minimizing low temperature shrinkage of an axially oriented heat set polyes ter film which includes heating the polyester film by employ ing impinging heated gas at a temperature of 140 to 180 C for a time period between 15 and 3 seconds as defined by the area in Figure 1,delineated by points A, B, C and D under tension of less than 2.413 10‚Å∂ pascal. The film is kept out of contact with any surface during the heat treatment.
