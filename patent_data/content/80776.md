## Description
FLOWER HOLDER The invention relates to a flower holder that can be fastened as interior or part thereof in a, for instance, blockshaped cardboard box having two end walls and two side walls, which flower holder consists of an insert having a top side, a bottom side and two longitudinal sides, in which insert openings have been made for inserting flower stalks and which insert can be fastened in a flat position in the cardboard box so that the flower stalks are on the under and the petals are on the upper surface of the insert. Such a flower holder is known from the German utility model 7038649. The disadvantage of this known flower holder is that it is suitable only for the transport up to the retailer and does not offer any possibility of display at the retailers and of further transfer by the consumer. The object of the invention is to provide a flower holder that does not have these disadvantages. This has been achieved in that the insert is built up of a number of oblong elements, each having a first narrow end, the bottom, turned towards the bottom side of the insert, and a second narrow end, the top, turned towards the top side of the insert, which elements are arranged with their long sides adjoining each other and connected, by means of separating joints, with adjacent elements, and in that each element has a number of openings at intervals in its longitudinal direction. Certain delicate kinds of cut flowers such as gerberas can be placed in the flower holder direct when harvested and can be put in the surrounding cardboard box after having been treated with water if so desired. Packed in this manner, they are shipped to the retailer. The insert can now be separated along the separating joints into a number of oblong holder elements, which can be displayed in buckets filled with water. Fastened on a holder element, the flowers can now be further conr veyed by the consumer. The advantage is that the flowers can remain in the holder or in the holder element from the place where they are harvested to the place where they are used and that, consequently, the retailer need not pick the flowers one by one from the holder, as with the known flower holders, and need not put them loose in the display buckets.So the risk of damage has been reduced here. Moreover, after the separation of the oblong elements, the flowers will be in the form of bunches, so that they may be taken away by the consumer as such, optionally wrapped in paper. This, therefore, also substantially reduces the risk of damage to the flowers, during the transport by the consumer. With the known flower holder used as an insert in a surrounding cardboard box, the petals and the flower stalks of the flowers inserted into the holder are both in a horizontal position. So the flower top is forced into a non natural position in respect of the stalk. The time required to restore it to its natural position will be longer as the residence time of the flower in the holder is longer.In order to enable the flowers, with the insert according to the invention, to be packed longer without any appreciable increase in the time required for the restoration, it will be an advantage for each element of the insert to be profiled so that the element is divided in its longitudinal direction into a number of compartments, for each compartment to comprise a base and two opposite cross walls diverging upwards, which cross walls are connected with cross sides of the base situated across the longitudinal direction of the element and extend at least over some distance on either side of the longitudinal axis of the element, and the edges on top of which are connected with the edges on top of cross walls of adjoining compartments, and for the cross wall turned towards the bottom of the element, the bottom wall, to be provided with an opening for inserting a flower stalk. The bottom wall is preferably at an angle of 450 with the horizontal plane, while the top wall is at a smaller angle with it. The tops of the flowers stuck on this insert are in a more natural position in respect of the stalks so that the time required for their restoration is virtually eliminated. Moreover, now that the petals are raised by a top wall, the petals of one flower will now suffer less from the stalk of a flower adjoining in lengthwise direction of an element. This unlike the known flower holder, which often has its openings placed so close together for the purpose of packing as many flowers as possible on an insert that the petals overlap adjoining openings. In order to bring the flower stalks in the compartments at the bottom in a horizontal position, the edge on top of the bottom wall of the compartment situated at the bottom of a preferred embodiment will have a cross wall sloping down away from this compartment. For the purpose of further protecting the petals, the long sides of the element are preferably provided with side walls diverging upwards, which side walls are connected with the bases of te compartments and which are higher than the cross walls, and the edges on top of which side walls are connected with adjoining elements by means of separating joints. The diverging side walls are favourable for guiding the petals and make it possible for the inserts to be nested. In order to obtain a higher dimensional stability of the insert or ctthe holder element, preference is given to connecting the cross walls with the side walls. By allowing the cross walls to extend from side wall to side wall each flower will be protected and enclosed in its own compartment. As the side walls are higher than the cross walls, it is particularly the petals lying side ways that are not damaged in the display and transport. The cross walls may have a curved shape conformed to the shape of the flowers and may then be connected with an adjusted base. In order to protect the flower stalks, the edges of the ope nings may be bent round. In order to have the petals between adjoining compartments lie close together, the openings in the bottom wall may have the shape of a gate, the base of which coincides with the edge on top of the bottom wall and the arch of which touches the rib formed by the bottom wall and the base. Another measure serving to protect the petals is that the base rises from the top wall to the bottom wall. In order to improve the separation between the petals of two adjoining compartments in the same element, there may be, at least at the base of the gate shaped opening, a vertical upward cross partition connected to a cross wall. In the embodiment in which the base rises from the top wall to the bottom wall, preference is given to providing, for the protection of the flower stalks, a vertical downward cross projection near the point of contact of the arch of the opening with the rib between bottom wall and base, which cross projection is bent round from the base and the free bottom end of which does not reach beyond the plane in which the ribs between top walls and bases are situated. For the purpose of bundling the flower stalks passing through the various openings each element can be provided at the bottom with an extension projecting into the longitudinal direction of the element.This extension advantageously has the shape of an inverted U whose diverging legs do not reach beyond the bases, thus providing optimum enclosure for the stalks and an entirely free space between the bottom of the cardboard box and the bases of an insert placed in the cardboard box. The open side of the U can be closed with a piece of adhesive tape or something similar. The flower holder designed in the form of an insert is preferably provided with fasteners permitting the insert to be suspended in the cardboard box so as to avoid the awkward stapling for securing it in the cardboard box. The fasteners on the top side of the insert may advantageously consist of a bridge connecting all the edges on top of the walls of the elements and having separating joints between the elements, which bridge is provided at its ends with spacers, which are in line with the longitudinal sides of the insert, and which bridge is provided, between the spacers, with a hook shaped member consisting of a horizontal part attached to the bridge and a vertical downward part, the horizontal part being situated within the reach of the spacers. The top side of the insert is suspended by the hook shaped member to an end wall of the cardboard box. As the hook shaped member does not reach as far as the spacers, the end wall must be pressed slightly inwards. Thus a gripping power results in consequence of which the hook shaped member is not apt to be detached from the wall of the cardboard box during transport. The fasteners on the bottom side of the insert may advantageously consist of hook shaped members fitted to the edges on top of the walls of the elements constituting the longitudinal sides of the insert, which members have a horizontal part projecting outwards and a vertical part pointing downwards. In order to strengthen the bottom side of the insert and to provide a handle, the edges on top of the walls of the elements can be connected on the bottom side of the insert by a bridge having separating joints between the elements. If the inserts must be capable of being nested, care must be taken that the bridges do no interfere. According to the intention the vertical edges of the side walls on the top and the bottom side of the insert are inclined upwards for that purpose, away from the insert. The edges on top of the side walls of the elements are preferably provided, at least at the bottom and the top, with wall evaluations with the separating joints in between. This will facilitate the breaking of these joints, because, when clutching the bottom of the insert for this purpose, the arm of the breaking force is increased.Moreover, the elevations create places on which the cover of the cardboard box can rest, which cover is thus kept away from the flowers packed in the cardboard box. It is highly recommendable to provide the insert with perforations consisting of a great many small holes. This perforation serves the ventilation of the flowers. The shape of the insert has been found to guarantee sufficient strength for this perforation to be applied without inconvenient weakening of the insert. Moreover, a substantial saving on raw materials is achieved and consequently a weight reduction also. Another advantageous embodiment of the invention is that in which each element comprises an oblong framework substantially lying in one plane, having in this framework, divided in lengthwise direction, a number of cups placed in the same position for receiving flower tops, which cups are so connected with the framework as to allow them to tilt in such a manner that the axis of each cup can be brought, from a position perpendicular to the plane of the framework, under an angle with that plane smaller than 90 , in which embodiment the axis tilts in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the framework and parallel to the longitudinal direction of the framework, and that the openings for inserting the flower stalks are in the bases of the cups. The advantage of this embodiment is that a cup can always adjust itself to a great extent to the natural position of the flower top in respect of the flower stalk. This is particularly advantageous with a flower holder first filled as insert in horizontal position with the flower stalks hanging down and then placed in a surrounding cardboard box with the flower stalks being brought into a horizontal position. In the further use of the insert, too, in which it is separated into elements, in the transport by the consumer and in the removal of the flowers from the elements, during which acts the flowers are brought as a whole into different positions, the give of the cup is important for preventing damage to the flower stalk, particularly the part of the flower stalk right under the flower top. The edges of the mouths of the cups are preferably situated in apertures formed by the framework and the edge of the mouth of each cup has a hinged of flexible connection, on the side turned towards the top of the element, with the framework. Thus, when tilted, the larger parts of the cups will be situated above the framework, which facilitates a visual inspection of the flowers in the cups. It is an advantage for the connections between the cups and the framework to have the form of flexible strips. When using brittle materials, this may prevent non desired breaking off and generally increases the flexibility of the cups in respect of the framework. A preferred arrangement of the elements in an insert is that in which the apertures of the framework of one element are staggered in respect of the apertures in the frameworks of adjoining elements at half a pitch in the longitudinal direction of the framework and in which the distance between the centre lines of two adjoining elements is equal to or smaller than the greatest width of an aperture measured perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of a framework. Thus a spatial advantage across the width may be obtained, the more so because, owing to the completely enclosed position of the flower tops in the cups, the petals cannot damage each other. For the purpose of effecting easy separation of the elements, the separating joints may consist of grooves between the framework in the form of undulating lines between the apertures of two adjoining frameworks The chosen dimensions of the cups and of the apertures may be such that the cups may be tilted from one side of the framework right through the apertures to the other side of the framework. In such an embodiment it is an advantage to have the parts of the edges of the apertures turned towards the bottom side of the element arched. These arches then serve as the stop surfaces for the flower stalks in the tilting of the cups when flowers are contained herein. The shapes of the inserts of the two embodiments given are such that they can advantageously be made from plastic by injection moulding. As the inserts are made from plastic, the wall thickness may be smaller than that of inserts of another material, for instance cardboard having the same strength. The invention will be further elucidated below with reference to a typical embodiment shown in the drawing. In the drawingFig. 1. is a carboard box with cover, in which box two inserts have been placed Fig. 2. is a perspective view of a flower holder according to the invention in the form of an insert with a few indications of an alternative design Fig. 3. is a top view of a part on the top side of the insert from fig. 2 Fig. 4. is a cross section according to line IV IV in fig. 2 Fig. 5. is a longitudinal section according to line V V in fig. 2 Fig. 6. is part of a longitudinal section of a variant of the insert according to the invention Fig. 7. is a cross section according to line VIl VIl in fig. 6 Fig. 8. is a top view of another embodiment according to the invention Fig. 9. is a diagrammatic section according to line IX IX in Fig. 8 Fig. 10. is a top view of a cup within area X surrounded with a dotted line in Fig. 9 on an increased scale X andFig. 11. is a section according to line IX IX in Fig. 10. Fig. 1 represents the principle of packing delicate cut flowers. In a block shaped cardboard box 1 having a lid 2 two inserts 3 and 4 have been placed. The stalks of the flowers stuck in insert 3 reach under insert 4 and vice versa. A perspective view of an insert 5 according to the invention is shown in fig. 2. Insert 5 has a bottom side 6 and a top side 7 and is made from plastic by injection moulding. The thickness of the material is about 0.5 1 mm everywhere. The insert is built up of oblong elements 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, each of which has a narrow end, the top, on the top side of the insert and a narrow end, the bottom, on the bottom side. In the drawing it is only element 11 of which the top has been indicated with 13 and the bottom with 14. For reasons of clearness the following reference figures in the drawing have been given in element 8 as far as possible. The embodiment shown consists of elements having a substantially gutter shaped cross section, see also fig. 4. The bottom is profiled so that top walls 14, bottom walls 15 and bases 16 are present.Walls 14 and 15, which diverge in respect of base 16, constitute cross walls connecting side walls 17 and 18 placed on the long sides of the element, which side walls diverge as well. At the top and bottom of the element the edges on top of the side walls have wall elevations 19 and 20 with a separating joint 21 in between. A separating joint is understood to mean a joint apt to break by bending the elements in respect of each other. All elements are inter connected by separating joints at their top and bottom. By the cooperation of opposite walls situated crosswise in respect of a base each element is divided into a number, in this case five, compartments. The bottom walls of the com partments at the bottom of the insert have, at their top edges, cross walls 22 slanting down. Bottom walls 15 are at an angle of 45 with the horizontal plane a, see fig. 5, and are provided with round openings 23, the edges of which are rounded off. Top walls 14 are at an angle smaller than 450 with the horizontal plane H. The whole insert is perforated as indicated with 24 for the compartment at the bottom of element 8 only. Each element is provided at its bottom with an extension 25 according to fig. 2 and 5, which extension has a cross section in the form of an inverted U with diverging legs 26 pointed downwards, which legs do not reach beyond horizontal plane E. Side walls 17 and 18 have strengthening ribs profiled with the wall at the place where top and bottom walls meet as indicated with 27. Fig. 6 and 7 are, respectively, a longitudinal section and a cross section of the second compartment from the bottom of element 10. In the variant of the invention represented in these figures bases 28 rise from top walls 14 to bottom walls 15. The bottom wall of a compartment is provided with a gate shaped opening 29 whose base is situated on rib 30 between bottom and top walls and whose arch touches rib 31 between base 28 and bottom wall 15. Rib 30 is provided with a cross partition 32 and rib 31 with a cross projection 33. The insert is provided at the bottom with fasteners consisting of hook shaped members 34 having horizontal parts 35 projecting outwards and vertical parts 36 directed downwards. The hook shaped members are situated on longitudinal sides 37 and 38 of the insert, on the side walls of elements 8 and 12 situated on these sides. At the top the fasteners consist of a bridge 39 connecting the edges on top of the side walls, which bridge is provided halfway with a hook shaped member 40 consisting of a horizontal part 41 and a vertical part 42 directed downwards. The ends of the bridge have spacers 43. The horizontal part 41 of the hook shaped member does not reach so far beyond the insert as spacers 43. This is clearly illustrated in fig. 3, where a dotted line 44 shows the course of the wall of a cardboard box by which the insert has been suspended with hook shaped member 40. At the bottom of the insert a similar bridge, not drawn here, can be provided, connecting all edges on top of the side walls of the elements. End edges 45 on the top side of the side walls of the elements are slanted so that the bridges do not interfere with the nesting of the inserts. If a bridge is provided also at the bottom, it will be an advantage, for the same reason, for the end edges of the side walls on the bottom side to be slanted as well. In Figures 8 up to and including 11 another embodiment of the flower holder is represented. The top view of Figure 8 shows that the insert is built up of five elements formed by oblong frameworks 46, 47, 48, 49 and 50 substantially lying in one plane. In each of the frame works there are five apertures 51 at equal intervals. Apertures 51 of a framework are staggered in respect of apertures 51 in adjoining frameworks, at half the interval, also referred to as pitch.Furthermore, the centre lines of the elements or frameworks are situated here at intervals equalling the greatest width of an aperture 51 measured perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of a framework. InFig. 8 this is indicated in frameworks 49 and 50 by respectively centre lines h1 and h2 at distance b, where distance b equals distance a indicating the greatest width of an aperture 51. Between the frameworks there is a separating joint 52 in the form of a groove in the sheet material, which groove may be undulating as indicated with 53. The elements, furthermore, consist of cups 54 situated, with edges 55 of their months, in apertures 51. For reasons of simplicity a detailed design of the frameworks is given in Fig. 8 for element 48 only.Edge 55 of the mouth of each cup is connected to the framework with the side turned to top 56 of the element by means of a flexible strip 57 extending from the edge of the mouth to edge 58 of a recess 59. The side of the edge of the mouth turned towards bottom 60 of the element is provided with a lip 61. In the base of the cup there is an opening 62 for inserting a flower stalk. The various parts of a cup are represented on an increased scale in Figures 10 and 11. The dimensions of aperture 51 and cups 54 are such that, if the cup is tilted into the direction of arrow A, see Fig. 11, in which point 63 represents a hinge axis perpenr dicular to the plane of the drawing, it can be passed through aperture 51.Axis h3 of the cup is then brought from a position perpendicular to the plane of framework 48 to an angle smaller than 90 with that plane.The edge of the aperture on the side turned towards the bottom of the element is arched as indicated in the drawing with 64. These arches constitute stop surfaces for the flower stalks when the flower filled cups are tilted. The top sides of the frameworks are connected with a cross strip 65 having separating joints as indicated with 66 for one separating joint between frameworks 49 and 50 in Fig. 8. The insert is further provided with an eye 67 for holding the insert. The insert is preferably filled in flat position, so with the axes of the cups in a vertical position as indicated in Fig. 9. After placing the insert in the surrounding cardboard box, the flower stalks are in a horizontal position, in which the cups are tilted along with the flowers. Each cup will then be in a position as indicated with dotted line 68 for the cup on the extreme right in the drawing in Fig. 9. When the surrounding cardboard box is closed, the cover and the bottom of which box are indicated in Fig. 9 with 69 and 70 respectively, cover 69 rests on lips 61 of the cups. In this embodiment, too, two inserts are placed in a surrounding cardboard box with the flower stalks turned towards each other. It may be an advantage for the surface of an insert to be chosen so that two inserts, with their bottom sides lying against each other, cover the entire horizontal section of a cardboard box in upright position. Using appropriate means, for instance a press button connection, the bottom sides of the inserts may be fastened together so that the inserts cannot move and, consequently, no mechanical fastening to the surrounding box will be required. This will be advantageous during the quality control at the auction, because the insert will only have to be lifted now. The cups are perforated for reasons of ventilation. The greatest diameter of a cup is for gerberas about 60 mm and its depth is about 55 mm.
