# COMPOSITE MAGNETIC HEAD DEVICE.

## Abstract
A composite magnetic head device consisting of a recording magnetic head and a reproducing magnetic head as a unitary structure, wherein the magnetic gap is narrowed to improve relation relative to a magnetic medium and to offer advantage in regard to reducing the size, facilitating assembly, and increasing the precision, on a first magnetic shield plate SH1 are mounted a recording magnetic head element 1R , an accompanying integrated circuit 32 and the like to constitute a recording head portion. On a second magnetic shield plate SH2 are mounted a reproducing magnetic head element 1P , an accompanying integrated circuit 35 and the like to constitute a reproducing head portion. The two portions are joined at the back surfaces of the first and second shield plates, and are held in a shield case 80 . Surfaces to oppose to the magnetic medium are generated on the recording head portion and the reproduc ing head portion by the cylindrical grinding.
