# Organosiloxane polymers and treatment of fibres therewith.

## Abstract
Novel organosiloxanes containing units of the formula HOOCQ iO in which Q represents a divalent group composed of carbon and hydrogen, and optionally oxygen or sulphur, and R represents a monovalent hydrocarbon group, the organosiloxanes also con taining at least two silicon bonded substituents selected from hydrogen atoms, alkoxy groups and alkoxyalkoxy groups. The organosiloxanes can be applied to textile fibres, optionally in conjunction with crosslinking agents and catalysts, to impart thereto resistance to soiling by oily substances.
