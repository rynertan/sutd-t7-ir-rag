## Description
IN SITU DETECTION OF H1IAN T CELL LEUKEMIA VIRUS TYPE IIIBackground of the Invention The present invention involves an in situ hybridization method useful for detecting rare cells low abundancy, i.e. less than 100 copies per cell expressingHTLV III RNA in primary, uncultured tissue samples taken from infected individuals. This method significantly increases the sensitivity of detection over other known methods. For example, the RNA probe of this invention allows high efficiency hybridization and greater autoradiographic efficiency over conventional DNA probes labelled by nick translation. These new probes exhibiting high specific activity are generated by new strand synthesis involving high activity precursors.The resulting asymmetric probe single strand results in high efficiency hybridization in part due to elimination of probe rearrangement. Furthermore, ribonuclease synthesis on non hybridized single stranded probes result in lower levels of non specific binding. Additionally, incorporation of a 35S label enhances autoradiographic efficiency over 3M or 125I labelled probes, permitting reduction or elimination of background labelling. Also, the half life of decay 90 days allows use of the labelled RNA for longer time periods. The acquired imnunode f i c i ency syndrome AIDS presents a severe, unexplained imnune deficiency that involves reduction in the number of helper T lymphocytes 0KT4 . The disease is usually accompanied by multiple opportunistic infections and or malignancies, the latter predominantly of the Kaposi s sarcoma type. In the prodromal stage previously called preAIDS, now referred to as ARC or AIDS related complex , other clinical manifestations may occur, most frequently unexplained chronic lymphadenopathy or leukopenia involving helper T lymphocytes. It has been shown that the newly discovered human retrovirus, human T cell leukemia lymphotropic virus type III HTLV IIIj is central in the development of AIDS. This virus shares many biological and physiochemical properties with HTLV types I and II, including a similar genomic organization, trans activation activity of a virally encoded polypeptide, tropism for T lymphocytes, and distant nucleic acid homology. Multiple lines of evidence have implicated HTLV III as the causative agent of AIDS.These include isolation of HTLV III virus from the majority of patients with AIDS or ARC as well as from a significant number of individuals at risk forAIDS, and detection of antibodies reactive against HTLV III antigens in almost all AIDS and ARC patients as well as hemophiliac AIDS cases, children with AIDS, and transfusion associated, donor recipient AIDS cases. It is now possible to molecularly clone and analyze cDNA to HTLV III genomic RNA, the unintegrated linear replicative intermediate form of HTLV III, and full length integrated proviral DNA forms of HTLV III. These studies have shown that the HTLV III genome is approximately 10 kilobases in length and lacks nucleic acid sequences present in normal human DNA. Using these clones for Southern blot analysis of fresh tissue specimens, HTLV III viral DNA was detected at low levels in fresh lymphoid tissue from a number, albeit a minority, of patients with AIDS or ARC. At the same time, in situ hybridization experiments were initiated to detect LV III viral RNA in fresh tissue from AIDS or ARC patients. In situ hybridization offers several advantages as a screening method for Ifl LV III sequences. The method is direct, quantitative, and requires very low quantities of tissue. Furthermore, information may be gained concerning the type sj of cells infected with and expressing HTLV III and the tissue distribution of HTLV III sequences, as well as the distribution of cells expressing HTLV III sequences within a particular tissue. Previous methods for RNA in situ hybridization exhibited relatively low sensitivity and could only detect RNA present at relatively high abundancy.It was therefore necessary to develop new methodology for in situ hydridization in order to detect HTLV III RNA in primary tissue.Utility Statement The present invention has specific application as a short diagnostic assay for detection of STLV III in primary, uncultured cells. Furthermore, this assay allows determination of a treatment s progress or success throughout and after treatment protocols. The highly sensitive in situ hybridization method may also be applied to the detection of messengerRNA mRNAi transcribed from genes important in transformat ion and or tumor progression. For example, in situ hybridization may detect cells with increased mRNA express ion of particular oncogenes which may signify an altered status. Such results, may for example, be used in staging malignancies, assaying therapeutic regimens, or detecting remission and relapse.Summary of the Invention The in situ hybridization method for detection of viral RNA or DNA Is briefly as follows. Primary, uncultured cells are placed onto microscope slides by one of two ways. Tissues from which cell suspensions can easily be made are centrifuged through ficoll hypaque to isolate mononuclear cells. A suspension of these cells is then centrituged onto the slides. Solid tissues are frozen and sections are cut using a cryostat. These sections are mounted on microscope slides. In either case, slides are fixed in paraformaldehyde for one minute and then stored in ethanol for periods extending up to six months or longer. Imnediately before hybridization, slides are pretreated with several treatments to block reactive groups.Preparations are hybridized with a 35S labeled HTLV III RNA probe for 3 hours followed by a 2 hour rinsing procedure. The slides are coated with a photographic emulsion, allowed to expose for 2 days, developed for visualization of silver grains, stained with Wright stain, and analyzed by light microscopy. In the above described in vitro process, which is more properly an assay, the RNA probe provides the basis for improvement over the known detection procedures. This probe detects HTLV III in primary, uncultured tissue samples, is highly sensitive, and is relatively fast acting typically two days . The RNA probe is synthesized from cloned HTLV III DNA inserted into a suitable transcription vector.Specific Disclosure Preparation of cells. Heparinized peripheral blood obtained from AIDS patients or normal individuals is centrifuged through Lymphocyte Separation Medium Litton Bionetics for separation of mononuclear cells.Cells are rinsed twice in RPMI 1640 media and resuspended at 106 cells ml in media containing 10 fetal calf serum. These cells are then deposited on microscope slides previously cleaned with 70 ethanol by cytocentrifugation of 200 pl cell suspension per slide. Slides are air dried for 5 min. then fixed to the slide. For this, slides are immersed in 4 paraformaldehyde Baker in PBS Ca, Mg free for 1 min. only, then transferred to 70 ethanol. Preparations are stored at 40C until used for hybridization. Preparation of 35S labeled RNA Probes. pSP64 R3 R3j consists of the 9.5 kb HTLV III insert of clone BHl0 inserted 3 5 on transcription vector pSP64 commercially obtained from Promega Biotechj. R3 DNA is digested withEco RI, which cuts midway in the viral genome in order to generate linear DNA template molecules. These DNA molecules are phenol chloroform extracted and ethanol precipitated before transcription.One microgram of R3 template DNA is transcribed in a 10 pl reaction containing 25 pM 35S UTP 1000 Ci mno 1 New England Nuclear , 500 pM ATP, CTP and GTP, 40 Tr Ttis HCl pH7.5 , 6 rrM MgC12, 2 rrM spermidine, 20 nM NaCl, 10 mM lIlT, 15 units RNasin Promega Biotecj, and 15 units SP6 polymerase New England Nuclear . After incubation at 400C for 30 min., 15 additional units of SP6 polymerase are added and unlabeled UTP is added to a final concen tration of 500 pM. The reaction is allowed to continue for 30 additional minutes at 4000.The DNA template is then digested by 20 pg ml DNase Worthington at 37 C for 10 min., and the 35S RNA purified according to Johnson and Johnson, 198i. Typically, 70 90 of 35S UTP is incorporated using this procedure. Purified RNA was stored in aliquots at 90C until used. In situ hybridization. Slide preparations are rinsed briefly in 2XSSC, a standard salt solution of chloride and citrate and acetylated in acetic anhydride triethanolamine, pH 8.0. The slides are then rinsed briefly in 2XSSC followed by PBS Ca, Mg free , and immersed in 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.0 , 0.1 M glycine for 30 min. Slides are rinsed in 2XSSC and placed in 50 forma mide 2XSSC at 550C immediately before application of the RNA probe. The hybridization mixture contained 105 cpm p 1 35S RNA probe. 50 formamide, 2XSSC, 10 mM DTT, 1 ml ml sheared salmon spern DNA, 1 ml ml E. coli tRNA, and 2 ml ml bovine serum albumin. The mixture is denatured by heating at 900C for 15 min. and was then cooled to 550C.Excess solution is removed from slides and 10 1 of hybridization mix is applied per slide. Coverslips 18 x 18 mm are mounted with rubber cement and hybridi zation is carried out at 500C for about 3 hr. The slides are then rinsed thoroughly in 50 formamide 2XSSC at 520C, followed by several rinses in 2XSSC. Ribonuclease treatment with 100 pg ml RNase A Sigma in combination with 1 pg ml RNase T1 Boehringer in 2XSSC is carried out for 30 min. at 3pox. The slides are again rinsed in 50 formamide 2XSSC at 520C, followed by rinsing in 2XSSC and dehydration in ethanol. Hybridized preparations are autoradiographed with NTB2 nuclear track emulsion Eastman diluted 1 1 with distilled water.After exposure for 2 days at 40C, the slides are developed inDektol Eastman and dried and stained with Wright stain Harleco . This method allows in situ detection ofHTLV III viral RNA in a very low percentage of cells typically 0.019 and in a short period of time 2 5 days . Primary cells from AIDS, ARC or high risk individuals may be assayed without culture. The types of samples primary cells include peripheral blood, bone marrow, lymph node and spleen cells from which a cell suspension is obtained, and solid tissue such as brain, lung, liver, lymph node, and Kaposi s sarcoma The HTLV III clone By10, from which a 90 Kb viral insert is obtained, is available through theAmerican Type Culture collection, accession No 40125. This clone is maintained in the ATCC in the manner prescribed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office with regard to permanence and availability of the deposit for 30 years plus 5 years after request for sample and without restriction on public access.Furthermore, the description of this HTVL III clone may be found in a United States Patent ApplicationWong Staal et al, Serial No. 643,306, filed 22ndAugust 1984, and titled Molecular Clones of theGenome of HTVL III . The corresponding EPCApplication is 85 3058 8.2. In general, cloning the HTVL III genome involved isolating unintegrated viral DNA after infection of H9 cells with concentrated HTVL III virus and cloning this DNA in a lambda phage library to be screened with viral cDNA. The cell line H9 HTVL III produces large quantities of HTVL III virus and serves as the principal producer cell line for immunological assays used to detect virus specific antigens and antibodies in AIDS serape Cultures of H9 HTVL III cells infected cells are grown and harvested, followed by extraction of low molecular weight DNA from the newly infected cells. This produces unintegrated viral DNA. Unintegrated linear DNA provirus DNA is then obtained, containing the entireHTVL III genome, i.e. replication competent. This DNA is then digested in plasmid lambda of Wes lambda B to form clone lambda BHlO. In situ hybridization as used above, is hybridization to nucleic acid s still in the cell, as opposed to RNA or DNA that has been isolated and or purified away from the cell. Additionally, the radiolabelled probe may be labelled with 3H, 1251, 32p, or preferably, 35sue
