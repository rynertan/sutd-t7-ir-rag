# STABLE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
A method of stabilizing an aqueous dispersion of water absorbent particles and at least one matrix forming hydro philic thickening agent comprises the steps of evacuating gas from said dispersion and subjecting the same to com pression by means of a relative pressure sufficient to ir reversibly transform the dispersion into a stable particle matrix system. A method of preparing a stable semi solid preparation of dry, preferably bead shaped water absorbent particles comprises forming a homogenous dispersion com prising from 30 to 70 by weight of said beads, from 0,1 by weight of a least one hydrophilic thickening agent, capable of forming a matrix for said beads, and from 20 to 55 by weight of water and stabilizing the dispersion formed as above. The water absorbent particles may consist of cross linked car bohydrates or polyacrylamide or derivatives thereof. The stable preparation may advantageously be packed in aero sol type containers and be used for the treatment of wounds and skin.
