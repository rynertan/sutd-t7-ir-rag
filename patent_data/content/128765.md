# OPTICAL TRANSMISSION CHANNEL

## Abstract
The present invention relates to the structure of an optical transmission channel 13 for use in a fiberscope, an optical fiber sensor or the like having an illuminating light transmission channel, an information light transmission channel and various kinds of auxiliary transmission channels. The optical transmis sion channel 13 is provided in its periphery with axially and extending grooves for receiving an image fiber 10 and a tube 12 for conducting fluid, the arrangement being such that the transmission channel has an almost circular section when the grooves are fitted with the image fiber and tube.
