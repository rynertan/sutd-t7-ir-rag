# Amorphous co based metal filaments and process for the production of the same.

## Abstract
An amorphous Co based metal filament having a circular cross section made of an alloy composed mainly of Co Si B or Co Me Si B wherein Me is at least one metal selected from the group consisting of Fe, Ni, Cr, Ta, Nb, V, Mo, Mn, W and Zr . This filament is produced by jetting the above alloy into a rotat ing member containing therein a cooling liquid through a spin ning nozzle having a hole diameter which is determined accord ing to the amorphous metal forming ability critical thickness to form an amorphous phase to thereby cool solidify the jet ted molten alloy and form a filament, and then winding the fila ment continuously on the inner walls of the rotating member by the rotary centrifugal force thereof. This amorphous metal fila ment is corrosion resistant, is tough and has high electromag netic characteristics, and is very useful as industrial materials, such as electric and electronic parts, composite materials and fibrous materials.
