# Production of starch from corn.

## Abstract
The time for the production of starch from corn is reduced to about one half the normal time, which results in a doubling of the capacity of existing installations, by subjecting corn which has not previously been subjected to lactic fermentation, to steeping in a medium containing SO2 under acid conditions such that lactic fermentation cannot occur. Proteins in the corn kernel, including insoluble proteins which become solubilized, are more quickly removed from the starch than by conventional lactic fermentation followed by treatment with SO2. In addition, the quality of the final products is improved.

## Description
The invention relates to the production of starch from corn.In the production of corn from starch, the corn is generally first steeped to effect softening of the kernel so that the germ, fiber, gluten and starch can be separated and the soluble components removed from the kernel.The conventional steeping process is a two phase process comprising a first lactic fermentation phase followed by a SO2 phase, and the conventional process generally lasts about 40 48 hours. Withe process involves countercurrent washing of the corn by aqueous solutions and in the first, or lactic fermentation phase the fresh corn is soaked in lactic bacteria rich solution and subjected to lactic fermentation for about 20 hours. The oldest corn is treated with an aqueous solution to which about 0,08 0,2 of S02 has been added and the SO2 has the effect of preventing further lactic fermentation. The steeping battery varies in size but generally consists of about 8 12 tanks.In the countercurrent process, which is actually a batch countercurrent process, the SO2 in each tank as the solution moves toward the freshest corn reduces in level and at a level below about 400 ppm, which takes about 20 hours, the lactic bacteria can develop and the same effects lactic fermentation. The introduction of higher levels of SO2 into the initial aqueous solutions, and increases of the flow rate of the water have not been effective in reducing the overall steeping time in the production of starch. Shorter steeping times have not resulted in efficient separation of the starch. It has thus been assumed that generally a steeping time of about 40 hours is necessary to loosen the starch in the endosperm of the corn kernels by solubilizing or softening the protein structure of the matrix in which the starch is embedded.Efforts to improve the overall process were mainly attempts to improve the lactic fermentation, for example by the addition of a small amount of SO2 to the lactic steep water to provide optimum growth of the lactic acid bacteria while inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganisms U.S. Patent No. 4,359,528 or by addingLactobacillus culture into the steep water U.K. PatentNo 1,489,909 . In accordance with the present invention, substantial lactic fermentation as a positive step is totally eliminated and the corn is instead directly subjected to S02 under acid conditions such that lactic fermentation cannot take place. As a result the total steeping time needed to soften the kernel so as to permit germ, fiber, gluten and starch separation and removal of soluble components from the corn so that the starch can be recovered therefrom, is reduced to about one half the time required in the normal two phase steeping process. It is accordingly a primary object of the present invention to provide for the steeping of corn for the production of starch therefrom in about one half the time normally required.It is another object of the present invention to provide a method of producing starch from corn by steeping of the corn, which method totally avoids lactic fermentation.It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide for the production of starch of a quality at least equal to that produced by two phase lactic fermentation followed by S02 treatment while avoiding lactic fermentation and thus reducing the total time to about one half.Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from a further reading of the specification and of the appended claims.With the above and other objects in view, the present invention mainly comprises subjecting corn which has not been previously subjected to lactic fermentation to treatment by SO2 in aqueous medium under acid conditions such that lactic fermentation cannot take place, whereby the starch granules are effectively loosened and the starch can be produced from the thus treated corn.In accordance with the present invention the corn which has not been previously subjected to lactic fermentation is steeped in an aqueous medium Containing SO 2 under acid conditions such that lactic fermentation cannot take place. The pH of the acidic medium for the purposes of the method of the invention is generally between about 2,2 and 3,9, preferably 2,8 3,9, and most preferably at a pH of about 3,5 3,8.The acidity of the medium to effect a pH range such that lactic fermentation is hindered can be achieved by means of any suitable acid, mineral acid or organic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, orthophosphoric acid, acetic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, etc., or mixtures thereof. It is also possible to maintain the desired pH range without the addition of another acid by the use of relatively large amounts of sulfur dioxide. In such event at the end of the steeping, the excess sulfur dioxide which might exceed the maximum permissible levels, can be destroyed or expelled by known means.In general, however, the simpler procedure is preferred, namely the use of SO2 plus another mineral acid or an organic acid. Of course, the mineral acids arse preferred from the standpoint of economy.The process can be carried out at any common temperature used for corn steeping. Temperatures of between about 10 600C are suitable. The most preferred temperature is about 500C. The concentration of SO2 in the steeping water which is at a pH such that lactic fermentation does not occur is generally maintained at between about 400 and 4000 ppm, preferably 400 3500 ppm and most preferably about 1000 2000 ppm.The steeping process according to the present invention comes to completion in between about 18 24 hours, 18 20 hours generally being sufficient.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the steeping during the intial period of up to about 6 8 hours is accompanied with agitation, without further agitation during the remainder of the process. While further agitation can be continued during the entire process, it has been found that after about 6 8 hours the agitation does not in any way improve the process, and therefore can be eliminated, with consequent reduction in energy costs, without in any way adversely affecting the process. In any event, as indicated, the overall process of the present invention requires between about 18 24 hours, as compared to the generally utilized two phase process which requires between about 36 48 hours. The savings in time also results in a saving in physical structure since plants of one half the size can produce the same quantity of starch as the older plants of double the size.On the other hand, the process of the present invention can be carried out in existing plants in which case the capacity is doubled.While the invention is not meant to be limited to any theory od why the process of the present invention is so effective, the following theory is given in the hope that it will lead to further research and still further advances in the art.The conventional steeping process which comprises a lactic fermentation phase followed by the SO2 phase has the objectives of softening the kernel so that the germ, fiber, gluten and starch can be separated and the soluble components removed from the kernel. In addition the objectives of the process include prevention of undesirable microbial activity and the provision of cleaning of the kernel.Whereas the separation of the germ and the fiber from the endosperm is achieved during steeping with relative ease, considerable time is required to effect the release of the starch granules from the protein matrix. Corn proteins consist of water soluble albumins and globulins 17 , water insoluble zein globules 39 and water insoluble glutelin 40 . The latter has a very high molecular weight and a structure of a three dimensional network primarily provided by disulfide bridges between the various cysteine residues. In the kernel, the starch granules are to a large extent entrapped within the glutelin matrix.It is therefore generally accepted that it is necessary to loosen the glutelin network before starch granules of high quality and yield can be recovered.Two parameters are commonly used to evaluate the suitability of steeped corn for wet milling, namely 1 the amount of water absorbed by the corn kernel, and 2 the content of total soluble solids inside the kernel, i.e. the extent of leaching of soluble components from the corn.Both of these parameters are not sensitive in the sense that they tend to level off, namely to change only very little with time during the later stages of the steeping beyond 20 hours or more in the conventional steeping process We have found that there is a good and sensitive correlation between the removal of insoluble protein from the corn during steeping and the quality of the produced starch. Thus, it has been found that the lower the level of residual insoluble protein in the corn, the lower the protein content of the produced starch, and consequently the higher the quality of the starch.The reason for this is that the insoluble protein matrix envelopes and traps the starch granules. In order to free the starch granules, the protein matrix must be broken.The tri dimensional protein network which must be broken is apparently primarily formed by disulfide protein linkages between the cystein residues, commonly referred to as S S bridges.We believe that the active species of SO2 in cleaving the protein S S bridges is SO3 . This species, however, only exists in significant proportions at relatively high pH values of about 5,0.EMI7.1 On the other hand, this species is charged and has very poor permeability as such into the corn kernel. Its penetration into the corn kernel is interfered with and prevented by charged molecules in cell membranes, cell walls, compounds, etc.When fresh corn is steeped in acid medium, preferably at pH 3,5 3,8, a small amount of free SO2 exists in equilibrium. This form is uncharged and is capable of penetrating into the corn kernel. However, inside the corn kernel the pH is high so that the SO2 dissociates into HSO3 and SO3 . The SO3 acts to cleave the protein and release the starch granules.Subsequently, the pH within the corn begins to drop as the acid penetrates. The ionized forms of SO2 are thus transformed back to the non ionized species which can further penetrate deeper by diffusion into the core in a radial manner, re ionizing to the active forms as new layers are reached, thus attacking and cleaving the protein.In this manner, the pH gradient inside the corn which is uniquely maintained by our process permits penetration of the SO2 throughout the corn kernel to cleave the protein and release the starch. Such penetration is not possible in the case of corn previously subjected to lactic fermentation because the lactic fermentation results in reduction of the pH within the corn kernels.In other words, in the conventional process the timing between the acid and the SO2 is very poor. and the cleavage of the protein by the S02 becomes relatively ineffective. The reason for this is that in the conventional process when the pH in the corn is still high there is essentially no SO2 in the medium or such small amounts that the S02 cannot penetrate into the corn kernel to cleave the protein and release the starch.Furthermore, when the SO2 phase is reached in the conventional process utilizing the lactic fermentation phase, the pH inside the corn is already quite low so that the SO2 that penetrates is not converted in significant amounts into S03 which is needed to effectively cleave the protein.In addition, in the case of lactic fermentation, the pH of the medium, which is generally about 4 4,4, is not sufficiently low to provide significant proportions of free, non ionized, S02 for penetration.Consequently, in the case of a conventional process, the relationship between the pH inside and outside the corn kernel to the SO2 levels in the medium are unfavourable and ineffective with respect to protein cleavage and release of starch.In accordance with the further embodiment of the present invention, the acidic medium containing SO2 may in addition contain a small quantity of a reducing agent such as cysteine or other compounds containing free SH groups. Such reducing agents also include thioglycerol and thioglycolic acid.A considerable advantage of the process of the present invention is that the same is applicable to any existing starch producing plant without change in the layout of the plant, and in addition the process can be carried out simply and with good control. The method of the present invention is most conveniently carried out in countercurrent in tanks made of wood, stainless steel or plastic materials which are capable of withstanding the temperature and acid conditions of the steeping operation. The acidic liquid is transferred countercurrently through the steeps and at times is recirculated over each steep. Consequently, in this process, the oldest corn is soaked or steeped with water containing the smallest amount of solubles and the freshest corn with water containing the largest amount of solubles. The corn iS completely covered during steeping to assure complete action on all of the corn kernels. It is also possible to automate the flow and cycling of the steeped water.The method of the present invention is generally carried out at atmospheric pressure, as in the case of conventional processes, although it is possible to utilize higher pressures with possible reduction in steeping time.The method of the present invention is applicable in all cases where the corn has not been essentially subjected to lactic fermentation. A small amount of lactic fermentation that might have occurred, for example in the case of storage of wet corn prior to processing, will not affect the process, provided that their has been no essential lactic fermentation. Description of preferred embodimentsThe following examples are given to further illustrate the present invention. The scope of the invention is not, however, meant to be limited to the specific details of the examples.For comparative purposes, examples 1 and 3 describe the conventional steeping process which include lactic fermentation, while examples 2 and 4 correspond to examples 1 and 3, however utilizing the process of the present invention in which lactic fermentation is eliminated. The results are summarized in tables 1 and 2, wherein part A relates to the conventional process of examples 1 and 3, respectively and part B correspond to the process of the present inventionOf examples 2 and 4, respectively.Example 1 using the conventional steeping process Corn at a rate of 6 ton hr was introduced into the steeping tanks which were maintained at 50 20C. The total number of tanks were 18. Process wader at the rate of 7,2 m3 hr. were introduced countercurrently to the corn stream. Sodium bisulfite was added into the freshest process water to provide a level of 1500 ppm 502. The total steeping time was 48 hours and the pH was in the range of 3,95 4,4. Sulfur dioxide was gradually reduced during the steeping to a level of about 300 ppm in the steeping medium. This was obtained in a tank wherein the corn was in the midst of the steeping period about 24 hours .At this low level of S02 lactic fermentation could occur. T he maximum level of acidity was reached in the steeping medium which encountered the fresh corn.In addition, the SO2 content continues to drop until a final level of about 30 ppm was found in the most concentrated steeping medium encountering the fresh corn.Part A of Table 1 summarizes the steeping conditions and efficiency thereof.Example 2 using the process according to the present invention The steeping lay out and conditions were. identical to that described in Example 1 with respect to the corn type utilized and to the steeping medium, rates and temperature prevailing during the operation. However only nine tanks were utilized and the steeping time was only 20 hours. The sulfur dioxide was added to the steep water so that its concentration was always about 2000 ppm and rigorous control was applied to ensure that the level of S02 did not drop below 800 ppm in order to prevent the formation of lactic fermentation .Phosphoric acid 70 by wt. H3PO4 in an amount of about 7,5 kg was added at several locations to the steeping water, so that the pH was in the range of 3,0 to 3,9 along the steeping operation.

Altogether there were 8 tanks, with a total holding capacity of 600 ton corn in each battery. Process water containing 700 ppm SO2 at a rate of 19 m3 hr per battery of steeping tanks was introduced in a countercurrent flow to the corn.The pH throughout the process was in the range of 4,0 4,4 in the various steeping tanks. Net steeping time was 36 40 hours. Results are presented inTable 2 Part A .Example 4 using the process according to the present invention Corn at a rate of 15 ton hr was introduced to each of 4 batteries of steeping tanks kept at 49 20C. Altogether there were 6 steeping tanks with a total holding capacity of about 300 tons corn in each battery. Process water at a rate of 19 m3 ht per battery of steeping tanks were introduced in a countercurrent flow to the corn.Sulfuric acid was added to the first 2 tanks and to the last tank in each battery, in each steeping cycle, from the corn side so that the pH was kept in the range of 3,4 3,9 throughout the steeping process. SO2 was added to the process water in an amount of 1000 ppm. In addition, sodium bisulfite 30 solution was added to the first and second tanks to obtain a concentration of about 1000 1200 ppm SO2. The steeping time was between 19 20 hours. Under these conditions lactic fermentation was completely inhibited. Results are presented in Table 2 part B .

It is thus apparent that the process of the present invention not only reduces the time to about one half of that of the conventional prodess, but in addition, the quality of the starch obtained is at least equal, and in fact somewhat better than in the case of the conventional process.While the invention has been illustrated in particular with respect to specific treating conditions, it is apparent that variations and modifications of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit or scope hereof.
