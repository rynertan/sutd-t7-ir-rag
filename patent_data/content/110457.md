# Method of desulfurizing waste gases containing sulfur dioxide.

## Abstract
Sulfur dioxide SO₂ is absorbed from waste gases by ab sorbing SO₂ in an aqueous absorbent comprising soluble sul fite in an absorber stripping the SO₂ from the absorbent ab sorbing the stripped SO₂ in a separate absorbent for the SO₂ and reacting the thus absorbed SO₂ in a liquid Claus reactor forming sulfur. In a preferred embodiment, the gas from the stripping step is subjected to a condensation step in a heat ex changer boiler where steam ingoing to the stripper is generat ed.
