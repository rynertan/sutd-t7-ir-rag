# Adhesion promoters.

## Abstract
An adhesion promoter for promoting the adhesion of a reduced polymerizable composition to a substrate, particu larly for promoting the adhesion of radical polymerizable dental composition to tooth material, comprises a polyethy lenically unsaturated monophosphate or salt thereof, the unsaturated monophosphate containing a monophosphate radical of the formula O OH â‚‚ and at least three ethylenically unsaturated groups per molecule. Preferred polyethylenically unsaturated phosphates are monophosphates of polyhydric alcohols containing at least four hydroxyl groups in which at least three hydroxyl groups are esterified with an ethylenically unsaturated car boxylic acid. Especially preferred unsaturated phosphates, which are provided as a feature of the invention, are those of the formula The polyethylenically unsaturated monophosphate may be first applied to the substrate, e.g. as a volatile organic solvent solution thereof, and the reduced poly merizable material then applied to the substrate and poly merized thereon. Alternatively, the polyethylenically unsatu rated mor hate may form part of a radical polymeriz able dental filling material applied to tooth material.
