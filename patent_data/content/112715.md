# Removal of surface multiples.

## Abstract
In a method of removing multiple surface reflection events from seismic data, pairs of real seismic traces having end points in common with a trace being analyzed are convolved with one another to yield synthetic multiple traces having real components. All possible combinations of real traces are thus convolved. These are then stacked to yield the synthetic multiple trace having the shortest total travel time, which is the synthetic multiple trace corresponding to the actual multiple reflection event recorded as part of the real trace being analyzed. The stacked synthetic multiple trace can then be subtracted from the real trace under analysis to yield a multiple free seismic record for further processing.
