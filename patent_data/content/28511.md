## Abstract
Cephamycin compounds of the formula I The compounds of the invention may be isolated from fermentation broths of strains of the genus Streptomyces which produce the compounds and a new such strain is described. The isolation of the compounds may be achieved by a liquid liquid or liquid solid ion exchange technique, and is preferably achieved by the formation of an ion pair in a liquid liquid technique.
