# Improvements in hydraulic motors and hydraulic pumps.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid displacing pump or motor 10 of the IGG type in which the inner gear 30 orbits about a fixed motor shaft axis 90 within an outer gear 32 . Variable volume chambers 52 formed between the gear teeth 35 and 61 are fluidly coupled to inlet and outlet fluid passageways 50, 105 at appropriately timed intervals by a rotary valve plate 48 having radially spaced ports 56 which rotate past inlet and outlet ports 54, 49 on a fixed commutator 16 . The rotary valve plate 48 abuts a planar face of the orbiting inner gear 30 and the stationary outer gear 32 and rotates about the fixed central axis 90 .
