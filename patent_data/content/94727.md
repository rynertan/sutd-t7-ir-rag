# Substituted heterocyclyl phenylformamidines, processes for their preparation and their pharmaceutical use.

## Abstract
Object of the present invention are new pharmacologically active substituted heterocyclylphenylformamidines of formula CHEM in which A represents a hydrogen atom, an amino group which may be substituted by one or two alkyl groups having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a saturated heterocyclic ring, R represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R1 represents a linear or branched alkyl group which may contain 1 or 2 heteroatoms such as a sulfur, an oxygen or nitrogen atom or may form a substituted or an unsubstituted cyclic ring, an alkenyl group, an alkynyl group, a cycloalkyl group or a phenyl group, R2 and R3 which may be the same or different, represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl or alkoxy group having 1 to 3 carbon atom or a halogen atom, m and n represent 0 or 1, Het represents a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclic ring containing from 1 to 3 heteroatoms except the imidazole ring when R1 is a linear or branched alkyl group not containing heteroatoms and R2 and R3 are both hydrogen atoms , tautomers thereof and acid addition salts of the aforesaid compounds. Processes for preparation of the compounds of formula I and their intermediates as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing them are also object of this invention. The new compounds are H2 receptor blocking agents, inhibit gastric acid secretion, and are useful antiulcer agents.
