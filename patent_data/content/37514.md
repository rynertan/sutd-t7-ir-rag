# Pressure control device with a fluid discharge prevention mechanism.

## Abstract
A pressure control device with a fluid discharge preven tion mechanism such that operation is reliable, size is small, weight is light, and cost is low. The pressure control device according to the present invention comprises a novel valve body 22 housing a weight 24 and a fluid discharge preven tion valve 25 together, a vessel body 27 with a tank communicating port 26 , and a lid 29 with an atmosphere communicating port 28 . The top circumferential surface 32 of the valve body 22 serves also as a vacuum pressure regulation valve in cooperation with the vessel body 27 .
