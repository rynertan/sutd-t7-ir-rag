# Page turning apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A page turning device is provided in which a first elongated arm is rotatably mounted for circular motion substantially parallel to but above the plane of the volume. A page lifting facility cooperates with the rotation of the first elongated arm to permit the first elongated arm to rotate between a lifted upper leaf and the remainder of the leaves of the volume. Continued rotation of the first elongated arm turns the upper leaf and positions the arm for turning of the next leaf. In this manner an unlimited number of leaves may be sequentially turned by a mechanically simple device which is immediately ready for use when a volume is positioned thereon.

## Claims
WARNING start of CLMS field may overlap end of DESC . tially parallel to the rotor arms 38 and 40 so that they can lift over the cam 54a when the latter is in an upward position. This Is now shown in Figures 9 and 10 which will be described. In the alternative embodiment shown m Figure 8, it will be noted that offseting arm 44b is pinned, at right angles, to another arm 55 which supports rotatable leaf securing element 50b. With regard to either of the arms 44a or 44b, they could advantageously be a leaf spnng so as to ac comodate text of various thicknesses. Averting now to Figure 9, hold down arm 36a Is shown partially broken away with its distai end members 38a and 40a Arm 36a is slipped over shaft 26a by its box like central apperture 59. An annular cellar 60 is positioned .within opening 59 and IS further provided with a cut out portion 61 which Is aligned about the shaft so as to permit lifting arm 30a to pass over the cam 54a Figure 5 . tilting the later arm so as not to effect a cam action as described above. This is shown in Figure 10 in phantom. When the upward bias of the cam has been passed, arm 36a reverts to its normally horizontal position. A screw means 62 is provided to adjustably pin the collar assembly 60 to rotating shaft 26a In Figure 11, there are shown three standing alone embodiments of the cam member Ila being much like the one shown as assembled in Figure 5 , which may also usefully be employed in this invention. Each of these cams provides a slightly different regimen for lifting means 50a m terrns of the time or compression placed by said means on the page. In a preferred mode of operation, microswitches not shown are positioned about shaft 26a for interrupting the rotational cycle of the shaft This has been found useful, for example, in tumog the pages of sheet music where arm 30a is positioned under the sheet of lifted music and stopped as shown in Figure 5. then by manually activating the start of rotation, the page is immediately tumed at the desired time in the score. Obvlwsly, other control means can be used to actuate the rotation of the shaft. With regard to the paperback form of book, another feature can be added to the support face 16 FIGS. 1 to 9 , which will broaden the scope of the invention. Such would be to modify face 16 under the area of book support by a rectangular cut out which would be replaced by a flexing panel that would be hmged linearly lust above support ledge 18 not shown . This would pivot retract downwardly for a r,elatively thick paperback type of book. Since this novel nature provides for flexing below the support surface, it will permit this embodiment to accomodate texts of practically any thickness. This altemate construction takes the place of spring 18a m the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7. It is also to be understood that the present invention, while of great advantage and usefulness to musicians, is not intended to be limited to such use, for comparable advantage will be realized by disabled mdividuals.

## Description
PAGE TURNING APPARATUS AND METHODFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a device for turning the pages of a book and, in particular, to a device which is adjustable to tuming the pages of books, sheet music and the like in a timed cycle or by manual operation.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The prior art has long recognized the need for a device to tum the pages of a book, pamphlet and or the like. The need has arisen from the handicapped as well as from those who need to read matenai contained in book form while using their hands for other things. A good example of the latter are musicians who must use their hands while reading music. The prior art has provided a muttiplicity of such devices including those disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 1,059,901 1,251,169 1,397,885 1,735,166 2,991,680 4,121,361 4,432,154 and 4,463,651. Most, if not ail, of these devices have proved to be unsuccessful for one or more reasons. Typical of these devices is a semi automatic page tumer disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,991,680. This device includes a pick up arm and a page tuming arm that rotates on a common shaft. Careful foot lever actuation is required to effect each turning of a page. Any page bulge has to be delicately positioned between pick up and page tuming arms, a step that leaves little room for mechanical maladjustments and an opportunity for failure. Many of the other devices were unreliable, inconvenient to use or simply not functonai. These devices varied from the complex to the simplistic. but regardless of the complexity or lack thereof, they were deficient in one way or another. In fact the serious defoiences of prior art page turners has become so well known that the public is now skepticai of those who suggest that such a workable device exists or can be made. Accordingly, there continues to exist a need for a page tumer which is functional, reliable, convenient to use and inexpensive. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide such a device.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method and apparatus for individually tuming the pages of a book or a compila tion of pages or leaves Generaily, the invention comprises a mounting table for supporting the book. A rotatable shaft is mounted, preferably perpendicularly, to and through said table. A means for rotating the shaft is provided and preferably mounted to the tabie. An elongated arm is mounted to the shaft for rotation therewith. The arm is mounted in a plane which is perpendicular to said table, but spaced apart therefrom. A cam means is provided which is pivotably mounted at one of its ends to the table and is biased so that its other end is normally spaced away from the table. The cam means is positioned for intersection with the arm, dunng the latter s rotation, for movement towards the table. A page lifting means E positioned on the cam means adjacent the end spaced from the table. The lifting means contacts a portion of a page, typicaily an upper comer, when the rotating arm intersects the cam means to force it towards the table. As the arm disengages the cam means, the arm end with the lifting means is biased away from the table thereby lifting the end of the page. As the arm continues to rotate, it interposes itself between the lifted and unlifted underlying page of the book and turns the lifted page during the final rotation of the arm. In a preferred embodiment the rotating arm is movably positioned on the rotating shaft to accommodate books of vanous thicknesses and sizes. Preferably, the arm is of a length sufficient to scribe an arc that passes under the page lifting means. Also, the relative positioning of the shaft, cam means and arm is preferably such that the arm intersects the cam means along a section of the arm which is dose to the shaft to facilitate overcoming the lifting bias of cam means. Consequently, any number of leaves may be sequentially turned, and no preliminary set up work is required, except to open the volume to the desired starting point and position it relative to the present invention. The movement of the elongated arm is conveniently controllable by electrical and or electronic facilities at positions remote from the open volume, sol.., by a mu iÅaan s foot or knee, and mechanical simplicity is provided. Other advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a perusal of the following detailed descnption of a presently preferred embodiment taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGFigure 1 is a perspective view of the front portion of a page tuming device of the present invention, in a position at the beginning of the page tuming cycle thereof.Figure 2 is a view similar to the view of Figure 1, showing the page tuming device in an intermediate position in the page turning cycle Figure 3 is a view similar to the view of Figure 1, showing the page tuming device in a posltion near the end of the page tuming cycle andFigure 4 is a side elevation of the page tuming device shown in Figure 1.Figure 5 is a front elevation view of the front portion of another embodiment of the page tuming device seen in its position at the beginning of the page tuming cycle Figure 6 is a top plan of the present invention, as seen along line VI VI shown in Figure 5 except that arm 22a has been rotated about 225 clockwise Figure 7 is a rightside of the device shown in Figure 5 Figure 8 is a of a Plan view of an aitemative embodiment of arm 44b securing element 50B.Figure 9 is a top plan view of an alternate embodiment of the page hold down arms shown in Figure 1 Figure 10 is a side elevational view of the alternate embodiment of Figure 9 depicting its hinged attachment to shaft 26a and showing support arm 36a both parailel to the support taMe 1 6a not shown and also in a phantom view, when It has been tilted in the course of the lifting over the camming arrangement and Figures 11 a, b and c depict in plan elevation three isolated embodiments of the cam member 54a of Figure 5.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS With reference to Figures 1 4, there is shown a page turning device 10 for tuming the leaves 12 of an open volume 14. Although not limiting to the invention. page tuming device 10 may include table means for supporting the volume, e.g., a support face 16 and a support iedge 18 upon which the volume 14 may be conveniently rested. A hingacly secured support bracket 20 may be conveniently positioned on the rear of support face 16 to hold the support face 16 in any desired inclination from the vertical. see Figure 4 Alternatively, the invention may be practiced utilizing a conventional music stand or plano stand to support the music or volume. With continued reference to Figures 1 4, a first elongated arm member 22 Is mounted to plate 24 on shaft 26 adjacent to the center region of the support face 16 to rotate through a circular path which is substantially parallel to but above the inane of the volume 14 on support face ls. As shown m the Figures, arm member 22 may conveniently include elongated portions 28 and 30 extending outwardly on opposite sides of shaft 26, with elongated portions 28 and 30 including slidably adjustable transverse fingers 32 and 34, respectively, at suitable locations therealong.In a manner which will be more apparent from later discussion, elongated portions 28 and 30 serve to alter naively tum indivldual leaves of volumes 14. Although not limiting to the invention, device 10 may also include a second elongated arm 36 mounted to shaft 26 spaced above and extending m a direction transverse to first elongated arm 22. Second elongated arm 36 is shorter in length than first elongated arm 22 and includes a pair of exposed hold down members 38 and 40 at distal ends thereof. to hold the top leaf of volume 14 m a viewable position until turning is effected. First and second elongated arms 22 and 36 are each vertically adjustable m position on shaft 26 to accomodate volumes of different thickness. Page tummg device 10 further includes a lifting means 42 which functions to lift individual leaves of volume 14 near their free end to a predetermmed elevated position above the plane of volume 14, and above the position of the elongated portions 28 and 30 as they sweep through that porbon of their circular path which Is above volume 14.Lifting facility 42 may nclude a pnrotable bracket arm 44 hingabty mounted to plate 24 and preferably extending over the end portions of the leaves of volume 14 when lowered thereto. A spring 46 secured between bracket arm 44 and plate 24 and a stop member 48 maintains bracket arm 42 in a rest position spaced from volume 14. A leaf secunng element 50 is mounted at the end of a bracket arm 44 to engage, Itghtiy secure and lift sequential knaves of volume 14 when the bracket arm 44 is urged downwardly theretoward. Leaf secunng element 50 may take a wide vanety of forms, including a magnetic member or a vacuum actuated member. However, In a preferred embodiment of the invention, leaf secunng element 50 takes the form of an endless, rotatably mounted belt 52 having a selected adhesive matenal thereon which lightly adheres to all known paper matenals and releases therefrom under appropriate urgmg without leaving a residue. Preferably a resilient cushion Is positioned inside endless belt 52 to facilitate proper pressure contact between endless belt 52 and leas of volume 14. The choice of a suitable adhesive matenal is somewhat critical to the embodiment that employs the rotatably mounted belt 52 as the top leaf lifting means. One type of paper tape which is well suited to use m the preferred embodiment is a particular Scotch Brand tape sold by the 3M Company of St Paul, Minnesota, under the trademark Post It Cover Up tape and notepacis. The chemical composition of the particular bonding agent is propnetary to that firm, but this tape requires no liner while coiled as purchased and when adapted to serve as a lifting belt It first adheres firmly to the text page when rolled thereon, but will separate just as ready when the arm 22 sweeps below the topmost page beyond the area where the belt 52 can normally remain in adhesive contact with the leaf 12. Other commertially avaf able glues could be applied to paper tapes to achieve the same objective. The criterion for use will be that they function within the parameters just defined as leaf lifting and separation. In the embodiment of the invention shown m Figures 1 4, a cam member 54 is secured to pivotable bracket arm 44 and controls the movement thereof by its inberachon with elongated portions 28 and 30. More particularly and with reference to Figure 2, as elongated portion 28 or 30 travels through its circular path in a clockwise direction, elongated portion 28 or 30 engages the cam surface 56 of cam member 54 and forces bracket arm 44 and leaf secunng element 50 toward the volume 14 against the blasing force of spring 46. Leaf secunng element 50 engages and lightly secures the top leaf of volume 14 as elongated portion 28 or 30 moves up cam surface 56.In this orientation, a portion of cam member 54 extends through a window 57 in the plate 24. As elongated portion 28 or 30 passes the apex of cam surface 56, the spnng 46 urges the bracket arm 44 away from volume 14 and leaf secunng element 50 lifts the top leaf of volume 14 to an elevation determined by stop member 48. As elongated arm 22 continues its arcuate movement, elongaled portion 28 or 30 trass between the elevated top leaf and the underlying leaves of volume 14.As the arcuate motion continues, elongated portion 28 or 30 engages the underside of the top leaf and exerts sufficient force thereto to overcome the light hold of leaf securing member 50. As elongated portion 28 or 30 ap preaches the centeriine of volume 14, one of hoddown members 38 and 40 moves into position over the top leaf to maintain same in a conveniently observabie position. Con tinned arcuate motion tums the top leaf about the centerline of volume 14 and uncovers a fresh leaf for viewing by the user.As shown in Figure 3, transverse fingers 38 and 40 serve to hold previously turned pages m an open position and thereby avoid the tendency of recently tumed pages to flip back of their own accord or under windy or drafty conditions. As can now be apprectated. the rotary mobon of arm member 22 actuates and controis the movement of the lifting facility 42. The rotary motion of arm member 22 may be conveniently energized by an electncal motor 60 which may be attached to the rear of plate 24 to dnve shaft 26. The operabon of motor 60 may convenientty contidled from a remote control device 62, ac., a push button or switch, positioned conveniently for the user, ac., for foot actuation by a musician. Preferably, motor 60 Is selected to provide arm member 22 with a controlled sweep of actuate motion upon each actuation, to occur at a controlled, relatively slow rate. For example, motor 60 can be selected to provide 1800 of arcuate motion for arm member 22 such that either elongated portion 28 or 30 can complete one leaf tuming cycle before coming to rest to await the next actuation of motor 60.With reference to Fig.1, it is preferable to control motor 60 to start and stop arm member 22 at a predetermined starting position, in which one of elongated portions 28 or 30 is positioned under the top leaf to be tumed, adjacent the centerline of volume 14. In this starting positon, elongated portion 28 or 30 is in position to immediately tum the top leaf upon actuation of motor 60. while hold down member 38 or 40 holds the free end of the top leaf down loosely for convenient viewing. As shown in Fig.2, upon actuation of motor 60, elongated portion 28 or 30 rotates to flip the top leaf while the opposing elongated portion begins to move along cam surface 56 of cam member 54 to actuate lifting facility 42. As shown in Fig.3, continued rotation of elongated portion 28 or 30 along cam surface 56 lowers and then raises leaf securing element 50 with the newly uncovered top sheet and the elongated portion moves thereunder. As shown inFig.1, motor 60 is de actuated when elongated portion 28 or 30 has continued to near the centeriine of the volume 14, and holddown member 38 or 40 has moved into position to loosely retain the top leaf for convenient viewing.Thus, 1800 of rotation of shaft 26 results in one complete cycle of page turning, with actual turning of the top leaf occuring at the beginning of the cycle so that a musician need not actuate motor trO prior to playing to the end of the music on a sheet Of course, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments of the invention de scribed above. For example, cam member 54 may be conveniently replaced by electrical timing and solenoid elements, whereby actuation of the remote control device 62 will activate motion of motor 60 and at the appropriate time, also activate an electrical solenoid which will lower and then raise the bracket arm 44 to lift the top leaf of volume 14.In like manner, electrical timing elements may be conveniently incorporated into the operation of the present invention to activate a vacuum actuated leaf securing member 50 which can draw a top leaf upward from the volume 14 without requiring movement of a bracket arm 44. A second embodiment of the invention which is par ticularly well suited for tuming pages of a text of sheet music and books is depicted in Figures 5 through 8. If there is little or no chance that tumed pages will flip backward of their own accord, the transverse finger or second elongated arm 36 of Figure 1 may be omitted. The operation of the page lifting facility of this embodiment is mechanically simplier than that described above. Referring to Figure 5, elongated arm member 22a is centrally anchored to shaft 26a, by mounting means 23aShalt 26a is rotatably mounted through inclined support table 1 6a, preferably at its upper central face. Am 22a is adapted to rotate clockwise in a circular path parallel to and spaced above the plane of volume 14 lying on face I 16aArm 22a comprises two diametrically opposing extensions 28a and 30a extending from mounting beam 23a and terminating in cylindrical knobs 32a and 34a, respectively.The primary function of the extensions has been disclosed in relation to those of the first embodiment. In the second embodiment, the center line of the book IS positioned on the table so as to be approximately perpendicular to the cam means and may be slightly displaced from the axis of the rotatable shaft. In this way the elongated arm is conveniently introduced between the upraised top leaf and the open volume and continues its arcuate motion to tum the top leaf from one side of the open volume to the other. Lifting means 42a Is somewhat different from that described above. It Includes a pivotable rigid member 62 which incorporates cam means 54a, and which is pivotably or hingably mounted to support surface 1 6a via hinge or prior assembly 64 at the one end, and pinned to offsetting arm 44a at the other end. Leaf securing element 50a is mounted at the outer end of arm 44a, and comprises an endless adhesive belt 52a, entrained over rollers 51 ratable mounted to arm 44a Beit 52a as shown in Figure 5 is positioned to lightly engage and adheres to topmost portion of page 12. As shown in Figure 5, Belt 52a engages page 12 until arm 30a rotates to the opposing side of the open text.In this version, the belt is oriented parallel to the upper edge of the open top leaf that is, at right angles when compared to the first embodiment Adjustable clamp 56 is anchored to the lower or upper nght hand edge of table surface 16a Adjustable clamp contacts, and retain in dace, the back cover of the text after the book is property positioned on the support table. Clamp 56 serves to preclude the entire text from drifting toward the left hand side of the support surface 1 6a, as could be induced by the clock wise tuming forces of rotating arms 28a and 30a moving repetitively across the pages. Now averting to Figure 6, there is depicted a simple, upwardly biased leaf spring 1 8s anchored to the edge of the backside of the surface 16a, the spring serves to compensate with its upward bias for the gradually diminishing thickness of the stacked pages 12, as the page tuming sequence proceeds well into the large text. The flexible leaf portion 58 would be interposed between the upper surface of the back cover and the lowermost of the stacked pages to be sequentially tumed. In operation, extensions 28a and 30a aitemateiy engage cam surface 56a of cam member 54a forcing offset arm 44a downwardly until element 50a engages and lightly secures to the topmost leaf of page 12, while the arms 28a or 30a moves along the top of cam surface 54a As the extension passes over the apex of cam surface 54a, the bias in hmge 52 provided via backside coiled spring 46a urges the arm 44a upward from the volume face t4 while element 50a lifts the topmost leaf 12 as arm 30a crosses the center line 66 of the volume. As elongated arm 22a continues in its circular path, extension 28a or 30a engage the underside of the topmost leaf exerting sufficient force to overcome the light adherence. The continuing circular motion flips the top leaf about the center line as seen in Figure 2 , uncoveing a fresh pair of pages to the viewer. Meanwhile, lifter 50a has swung back to the starting position, whereby endless belt 52a comes to rest above the new topmost leaf as seen inFigure 2 . The rotary movement of member 22a is initiated, as earlier described by intermittent actuation, as the user so requires. Preferably, one contact of the switch 62 Figure 4 is sufficient to cause one page turning necessarity an 1800 arcuate motion until activated again. it will be evident in this embodiment, that the page hold down arm assembly 38. 40 has been omitted here for ease of viewing. However, Its optional inclusion in this embodiment would be equally useful. It could vary from that depicted in Figures 14, in that it may be altemately hinged in the center of the shaft 26, with the hinge line substan tially parallel to the rotor arms 38 and 40 so that they can lift over the cam 54a when the latter is in an upward position. This Is now shown in Figures 9 and 10 which will be described. In the alternative embodiment shown m Figure 8, it will be noted that offseting arm 44b is pinned, at right angles, to another arm 55 which supports rotatable leaf securing element 50b. With regard to either of the arms 44a or 44b, they could advantageously be a leaf spnng so as to ac comodate text of various thicknesses. Averting now to Figure 9, hold down arm 36a Is shown partially broken away with its distai end members 38a and 40a Arm 36a is slipped over shaft 26a by its box like central apperture 59. An annular cellar 60 is positioned .within opening 59 and IS further provided with a cut out portion 61 which Is aligned about the shaft so as to permit lifting arm 30a to pass over the cam 54a Figure 5 . tilting the later arm so as not to effect a cam action as described above. This is shown in Figure 10 in phantom. When the upward bias of the cam has been passed, arm 36a reverts to its normally horizontal position.A screw means 62 is provided to adjustably pin the collar assembly 60 to rotating shaft 26a In Figure 11, there are shown three standing alone embodiments of the cam member Ila being much like the one shown as assembled in Figure 5 , which may also usefully be employed in this invention. Each of these cams provides a slightly different regimen for lifting means 50a m terrns of the time or compression placed by said means on the page. In a preferred mode of operation, microswitches not shown are positioned about shaft 26a for interrupting the rotational cycle of the shaft This has been found useful, for example, in tumog the pages of sheet music where arm 30a is positioned under the sheet of lifted music and stopped as shown in Figure 5. then by manually activating the start of rotation, the page is immediately tumed at the desired time in the score. Obvlwsly, other control means can be used to actuate the rotation of the shaft. With regard to the paperback form of book, another feature can be added to the support face 16 FIGS. 1 to 9 , which will broaden the scope of the invention. Such would be to modify face 16 under the area of book support by a rectangular cut out which would be replaced by a flexing panel that would be hmged linearly lust above support ledge 18 not shown . This would pivot retract downwardly for a r,elatively thick paperback type of book. Since this novel nature provides for flexing below the support surface, it will permit this embodiment to accomodate texts of practically any thickness. This altemate construction takes the place of spring 18a m the embodiment of FIGS. 6 and 7. It is also to be understood that the present invention, while of great advantage and usefulness to musicians, is not intended to be limited to such use, for comparable advantage will be realized by disabled mdividuals. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is limited onty by the claims which follow. Clalms 1. An apparatus for mdividualty tumng the pages of a book or other compilation of pages compnsing a a mounting table for supporting a book on its upper surface b. a rotatable shaft perpendicularly mounted through said table for rotation c an elongated arm means mounted on and adapted for rotation with said shaft and also adapted to contact a cam means said arm means being parallel to and spaced apart from said upper surface d. a cam means pivotally mounted to said table, said cam means being biased away from the table and positioned for interseion with the elongated arm, said cam means including biasing means e. means for lifting a page mounted to said cam means and f. means for rotating said rotatable shaft in one direction only. 2. An apparatus for tummg the leaves individually d a text of sheet music, book or the like havmg a common centerline about which the text leaves are manually rotated, comprising a . a support surface adapted to support the open text in a position convenient for viewing by the user of the apparatus b . a rotatable shaft mounted essentially perpendicular to and mounted upon said support surface and spaced apart from the upper edge of open text c a first elongated arm member operably mounted to the shaft and adapted to be rotated when mechanically activated said first arm member being positioned on the shalt relative to said open text so as to be rotated in a plane which is erally parallel to the plane defined by the plane of the open text and is spaced a first distance therefrom so that the path of first arm rotation is at least partially above said open text d means for lifting the topmost leaf a second distance above the underlying teavss of said open text wherein said second distance is measureabiy greater than said first distance and e means for rotating said first arm member through said circular path from the one side of said centerline on which the topmost leaf is positioned over to the opposing side of said centerline, whereby the first arm while rotating through said path is interposed between said top leaf and the leaves underlying same so as to tum said top leaf about said centerline until it contacts the opposing side. 3. The apparatus according to claim 2, further comprising means for actuating said leaf lifting means in synchroniza tion with the rotation path of said first arm member so that the portion of said top leaf is lifted to said second distance just prior to the amval of said first arm member above said one side so as to permit said first arm member to be interposed therebetween and tum the top leaf over to rest on said opposite side of said centerline.4. The apparatus as set forth in Claim 3, wherein said first arm member comprises two rod extensions diametrically WARNING end of DESC field may overlap start of CLMS .
