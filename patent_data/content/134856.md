## Description
DAMPENING VIBRATION OF ROTATING SHAFTS This invention relates to apparatus for dampening vibration of rotating shafts. Most machinery shafts subject to rotation are supported between two or more bearings positioned at spaced locations along the shaft length. when such shafts as would be encountered in, for example, a turbocompressor are subject to high power inputs and operate at rotational velocities on the order of 2000 r.p.m. and above, it is not uncommon to incur amplitudes of lateral vibration exceeding the usual tolerance of about 0.002 inches 0.025mm . Typically, the amplitudes of vibration at various axial shaft locations intermediate the bearings can be about 0.01 inches 0.25mum and above. The eccentricity which results from those vibrations can produce various undesirable effects, not least of which is a rubbing contact between rotating elements on or near the shaft.An adverse effect on seals required for efficient operation of the machinery, including premature seal failure, is a typical consequence of such vibration. For overcoming the adverse effects of vibration, various measures have been taken including, for example, increasing the shaft diameter, using different materials, reducing the mass, use of special, or an increased number of, bearings, special types and locations of oil seals where feasible, limiting the operating speed of the equipment to exclude rotational velocities at which vibration tends to become severe, etc. However, none of these measures has been entirely satisfactory. Another approach frequently utilized almost as a last resort has been a limiting of shaft length, requiring changes to the equipment that would otherwise be unnecessary. However, this frequently results in excessive manufacturing costs which either have to be absorbed or passed on to the customer. We have now found that the lateral vibration of a rotating shaft can be damped to within tolerable limits, at selected locations along its length intermediate the bearings by utilizing the vibration to cause relative movement between an electrical conductor and a magnetic field, thus inducing an electrical current in the conductor causing energy dissipation that reduces the shaft vibration amplitude. By effectively controlling the vibration amplitudes in that manner, the previous generally unsatisfactory approaches to the problem are overcome in a highly effective and economical manner. According to the present invention, there is provided apparatus for dampening the amplitude of lateral vibration of a rotating shaft, which apparatus comprises a magnet means for forming a magnetic field axially extending concentrically about said shaft b annular member means defining an electrically conductive band radially adjacent the magnetic field formed by said magnet means and wherein c one of said annular member means and said magnet means is arranged to be rotationally secured to said shaft, and the other is arranged to be supported stationary radially outward of said one means, whereby, in use, excessive vibrational amplitude incurred by said shaft causes said magnetic field to be penetrated by the electrically conductive band of said annular member means, to generate a force dampening said vibration. The invention also includes a method of dampening the amplitude of lateral vibration of a rotating shaft, which comprises mounting an annular member for rotation with the shaft, the annular member being insulated from the shaft but including an electrically conductive member, and disposing a magnetic field outwardly of the annular member whereby the annular member is caused to move in and relative to the field when vibration of the shaft occurs, said movement inducing a force to dampen said vibration. In order that the invention may be more fully understood, two embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE i is a diagrammatic illustration of a dampening apparatus of the invention on a rotating shaft, FIGURE 2 is an enlarged fragmentary view of the encircled portion 2 of Figure 1 for a non vibratory condition of the rotating shaft FIGURE 3 is an enlarged fragmentary view similar to Figure 2 for a vibratory condition of the rotating shaft and FIGURE 4 is an enlarged fragmentary view, similar to Figure 2, of an alternative embodiment. Referring now to the drawings, there is illustrated in Figure 1 a motor 10 driving a shaft 12 within machinery 14 shown in phantom and which typically could comprise a turbocompressor or the like. Supporting shaft 12 for rotation, at opposite ends thereof, are bearings 16 and 18.Ordinarily, in the absence of the invention, the shaft intermediate the bearings would be free to incur whatever offsets or the like might be imposed by the forces being encountered. In accordance with the invention, a ring 20 is secured to shaft 12 for rotation therewith shown for purposes of illustration at an intermediate location approximately central between the bearings 16 and 18. Ring 20 includes a body 22 secured to the shaft as by keying, welding, etc. and at least centrally comprised of a composition having relatively high tensible strength and high electrical resistance. Typically suitable for that purpose would be K monel age hardened. Banded about the annular periphery of body 22 are one or more layers 24 of a n electrically conductive material such as gold, silver or copper. Cooperating with ring 20 is a transverse magnetic field 25 extending circumferentially about the ring periphery and provided by a plurality of elongated spaced apart permanent magnets 26. The magnets are arranged around shaft 12 at a radial distance A at which the inward edge of field 25 generally coincides with the diameter of ring 20. The north and south poles of magnets 26 are symmetrically spaced apart with respect to ring 22 a distance B as will be explained hereafter. In that arrangement, vibration excursions of shaft 12 at the location of ring 20 will cause the conductive layers or bands 24 of ring 20 to penetrate magnetic field 25 in the manner illustrated in Figure 3. Radial ring penetration of magnetic field 25 induces a circumferential electrical current in ring bands 24 proportional to the radial velocity of shaft vibration and the change in magnetic field which the bands encounter.By virtue of bands 24 constituting a continuous circumferential conductor, the circumferential current generated thereby leads to energy dissipation from the bands as thermal energy to the pumped gas. Dissipation is in an amount generally proportional to the current squared times the electrical resistance of bands 24. Any force imposed radially on the shaft is opposed by the shaft inertia, shaft springiness and damping. Since heat dissipation from ring 20 is due to vibration of the ring in magnetic field 25, a damping force results from dissipation of the radial force times the vibration velocity. Because of a tangential force component of field 25 encountered whenever bands 24 initially penetrate the magnetic field, the field is disposed at a distance A determined to be penetrated by outermost band 24 only when vibrational displacement of the shaft occurs thereat. In this manner, excessive drag on shaft rotation that could result from such tangential force is avoided thereby enabling most of the field force to be effective for restoring shaft concentricity rather than imposing undesirable rotational drag. At the same time, the radius of ring 20 and consequent drag should preferably be minimized since the force of resistance is directly proportional to rotational velocity. Similarly, spacing B between opposed magnets 26 should be held ta a minimum within practical limits in order to maintain the magnetic field gradient at the periphery of ring 20 to as great a value as possible. Moreover, magnetic field shaping as is known in the art can be used to enhance the dampening effect imposed by this arrangement. In mathematical terms, a length of conductor moving at a velocity v in a magnetic field at right angles to the field of strength B has induced in it a voltage E such that E v The force F encountered by the conductor is proportional to the induced current I F I Bt The relation in a conductor that the current is equal to the voltage divided by the resistance I E REMI5.1 The energy dissipated W in a closed conductor is the product of the voltage and currentEMI5.2 Assuming a ring 20 of 6 inches 15.2cm diameter, vibrating at 2000 cycles min. with a cross sectional area of 1 square inch 6.45 squ. m in a field of 1 weber m2 10,000 gauss with an amplitude of 0.01 inches 0.25mm F 608.Newtons i.e. 137. pounds force and W 20.5 watts Assuming that the vibrating shaft 12 is 2 inches 5.08cm in diameter, 24 inches 61cm between bearings and of steel having a vibratory magnification factor of 100, the static deflection y under the dynamic force P would be 0.01 100 1 x 10 inches .0025mm . From the deflection formula for a round shaft supported on both ends with a center loadEMI6.1 whereEMI6.2 and P 7.91 pounds 35.2N at resonance. The mechanical power of this vibration would be Py cycle, or for 2000 cycles min. 0.935 watts With a force P of 7.91 pounds 35.2N , the magnification factor could be as low as 5.7 or the vibratory force could be about 17 times the force needed to cause the .01 inches 0.25mm deflection assumed at a dynamic magnification factor of 100. For the calculated example, radial vibration would be reduced from the assumed 0.010 inches 0.254mum to, about 0.0012 inches 0.030mm . For the alternative embodiment of Figure 4, ring 20 includes a plurality of uniformly spaced concentric apertures 28 near its periphery. Within each aperture is secured a permanent magnet 30 adapted to cooperate with stationary copper rings 32 and 34 encircling shaft 12. As in the previous embodiment, vibrational amplitude incurred by shaft 12 will cause an energy dissipating current to be generated for restoring concentricity. In operation, any vibrational amplitude incurred by ring 20 in excess of the field will cause conductive bands 24 to penetrate into the magnetic field 25 of magnets 26. On bands 24 being immersed in the field, an energy dissipating current is instantly generated causing shaft concentricity to be immediately restored. Operation is simple and yet is highly efficient compared to previous approaches employed for that purpose. While for purposes of description only one ring 20 has been shown centrally located on shaft 12, a plurality of such rings could be employed at any additional locations thereon at which vibration excursion can be anticipated. Moreover, the arrangement of the conductive bands 24 and magnetic members could optionally be reversed in the manner of Figure 4. Since many changes could be made in the above construction and many apparently widely different embodiments of this invention could be made without departing from the scope thereof, it is intended that all matter contained in the drawings and specification shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
