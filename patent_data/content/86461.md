# A process for reducing the formation of coke in a thermal cracking process and antifoulant composition.

## Abstract
The formation of carbon on metals exposed to hydrocar bons in a thermal cracking prooess is reduced by contacting such metals with an antifoulant selected from the group con sisting of tin, a combination of tin and antimony, a combination of germanium and antimony, a combination of tin and germani um and a combination of tin, antimony and germanium.
