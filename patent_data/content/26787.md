# TAPPING TOOL FOR HOLES AS CAST.

## Abstract
Tapping tool used for machining holes as cast in cast ings. The tool has cutting edges 4a to 4d , a guide portion 3 , a tapping portion 2 and a shank 1 extended to the tapping portion. The holes as cast are face cut and drilled with said cutting edge to make holes before threading, then finished by reaming with said guide portion, and cut into female threads with said tapping portion. Highly ac curate female threads can be made readily and rapidly, because of perfect alignment of the center line of the hole before tapping with that of the tapped hole.

## Description
SPECIFICATIONTechnical Field This invention is concerned with a tapping tool for cast hole, which subjects the cast hole formed in an article of manufacture at the time of its casting to a female thread cutting work.Background Art The cast hole in a cast article is liable to fluctuate its precision between its axial centers, and, moreover, since a marginal allowance is non uniform due to difference in the drafting gradient, and so on, breakage of the tap tends to occur readily when the female thread cutting work is effected by direct tapping, and it has been almost impossible to obtain the female thread having high precision. In view of the circumstances, there has so far been practiced generally to subject the cast hole to a sub hole machining, followed by the female thread cutting work by the use of the tap.However, in the case of using this expedient, not only the number of the process steps increases, but also a drill for perforating the sub hole would inevitably follow the shape of the cast hole at the time of the sub hole machining with the consequence that no accurate sub hole can be perforated. As the result of this, the axial center of the sub hole and the axial center of the tap become discrepant, hence it is impossible to obtain the female thread of high precision. Moreover, difference between the two axial centers would constitute a cause for inviting breakage of the tap itself.Disclosure of Invention The present invention aims at providing a tapping tool capable of effecting the female thread cutting work of high precision with good efficiency with respect to the cast hole in the abovementioned cast article, and also having improved tool life. The abovementioned object of the present invention can be attained by a tapping tool for a cast hole having a shank, a tap section continuous to the shank, a guide section continuous to the tap section, and cutting blades at the tip end of the guide section, which is capable of performing the front face cutting, in which a diameter D of the abovementioned guide section with respect to an outer diameter D1 of the tap section and a diameterD2 of a valley is in a relationship of D2 D D11 a length from the tip end of the cutting blade at the abovementioned guide section to the terminal end of the engaging section of the tap section with respect to the pitch P of the tap section is in a relationship of 2Po 2 1OP, and a length 1 of the abovementioned guide section with respect to a pitch P of the tap section and n numbers of groove for discharging chips is in a relationship of P P n. Since the present invention is constructed as mentioned above, it is possible to effect an accurate sub hole machining by the cutting blades at the tip end of the guide section through the steps of first cutting the front face of the cast hole, and then by the action of a reamer of the guide section, even if there exist fluctuation in precision between the axial centers in the cast hole, difference in the drafting gradient, and so forth.Moreover, since the female thread cutting work is effected by the tap section in continuation to the sub hole machining, the axial center of the sub hole and the axial center of the tap are perfectly coincided, whereby a female of thread of high precision can be obtained readily and quickly. Also, due to particular dimensional relationship among those parts of the tool, there is no awkaward force to act on the tapping section, so that the life of the tool can be improved.Brief Explanations of Drawing Figure 1 is a front view of the first embodiment of the machine tool according to the present invention Figure 2 is a bottom plan view of the first embodiment Figure 3 is an explanatory diagram showing dimension of each part of the first embodiment Figure 4 is a partial longitudinal cross section of the first embodiment Figure 5 is a partial longitudinal cross sectional view of the second embodiment, in which a feeding hole for coolant, etc. has been modified Figure 6 is a partial front view of the third embodiment, in which the guide section has been modified Figure 7 is a partial front view of the fourth embodiment, in which the guide section has been modified and Figure 8 is an explanatory diagram showing dimension of each part of the fifth embodiment, in which the tap section has been modified.Best Mode to Practice the Invention In Figure 1, a numeral 1 refers to a shank which has a tap section 2 continuous to the shank 1 and further a guide section 3 continuous to the tap section. At the tip end of the guide section 3, there are provided a plurality of cutting blades 4a 4d capable of performing the front face cutting. As shown in Figure 3, a diameter D of the abovementioned guide section 3 is established in a relationship of D2 D1 with respect to an outer diameter D1 of the tap section 2 and a diameter D2 of a valley. The reason for this is that, with a relationship of D D1, no thread cutting can be done, and that, with a relationship of D2 D, no contribution can be gained in the torque reduction of the tap and reduction in the quantity of cutting as well to shorten the life of the tool. Also, a length g from the tip end of the cutting blade of the abovementioned guide section 3 to the terminal end of the engaging part, 2a of the tap section 2 is set in a relationship of 2P 2 i1OP with respect to the pitch P of the tap section 2.The reason for this is that, with a relationship of 4 1OP, the tap is broken to cause rotational errors, etc., and that, with a relationship of 2P, the tool oscillates to invite lowering of the surface precision. Further, the length 1 of the abovementioned guide section 3 is set in a relationship of 112 P n with respect to the pitch P of the tap section 2 and the groove number n. The reason for this is that, with a relationship of µ1 P n, the sub hole cannot be formed with the cutting blades 4a 4d of the guide section 3. A feeding port 5 for coolant or air is provided at the axial center of the abovementioned shank 1, tap section 2, and guide section 3, one end of which is open to the end face of the shank, and the other end of which is open to the end face of the guide section as shown in Figures 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7. The above mentioned feeding port 5 may be branched in the vicinity of the tip end of the guide section 3, and be open to each of the grooves 6a 6d, as shown in Figure 5. The coolant or air which is supplied through the feeding port 5 also has an effect of discharging chips. The abovementioned guide section 3 has a tapered surface 3a at its tip end as shown in Figure 1, or a staged part 3b as shown in Figure 6 so as to perform size reduction of the chips produced at the time of the cutting operation, although it may be shaped straight, as shown in Figure 7, depending on necessity.Also, in order to improve discharging of the chips, tapered surfaces 7a 7d with a downward gradient toward the tip end of the guide section are formed in the grooves 6a 6d extending from the abovementioned tap section 2 to the tip end of the guide section 3. Figure 8 shows another embodiment of the tapping tool, in which the bottom of the valley of the tap section 2 is formed flat with a diameter D3 of the valley and the diameter D of the guide section 3 being maintained in a relationship of D3 D. The other dimensional requirements are the same as the abovementioned embodiment. As stated above, when the bottom of the valley of the tap section 2 is made flat and the diameter D3 of the valley is made identical with the diameter D of the guide section 3, rigidity of the tap 2 increases and the life of the tap section improves much more. Incidentally, even in the tool shown in Figure 8, the feeding port 5 for air or coolant as shown in the Figures 4 and 5 embodiments is adopted, and also those constructions suoh as the tapered surfaces 7a 7d of the grooves 6a 6d Figure 4 , the tapered surface 3a of the guide section 3, the tapered surface 3b thereof, or the straight guide section, etc. are adopted.
