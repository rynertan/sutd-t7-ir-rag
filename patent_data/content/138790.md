# Arrangement for the closure of an opening in a casing for electrical components, particularly capacitors.

## Abstract
An arrangement for the closure of an opening 3 in a casing 1 for electrical components, particularly capacitors 2 . The arrangement includes a lid 4 having an annular recess 5, 6 on its upper face for receiving a sealing ring 10 , which engages against the inner wall of the casing. The low er face 9 of the lid engages against an interior abutment 12 in the casing. The sealing ring 10 , which is retained by a folded over edge 11 on the casing, is compressed to form a pressure transmitting mass, providing sealing pressure in both axial and radial directions.

## Claims
CLAIM Arrangement for the closure of an open side of a casing for electrical components, particurlarly capacitors, with the aid of a lid having a peripherally projecting flange and a sealing ring surrounding the lid, characterized in that the casing 1 is provided with a peripherally extending through like portion 12,14 with a concave section seen from within the casing for gripping round the flange 7 and retaining it against displacement in the casing in both an axial as well as a radial direction, and also a peripherally extending through like portion 14 with convex section seen from within the casing, said portion engaging against the sealing ring 10 and urging it in a radial direction towards the lid 4 .

## Description
ARRANGEMENT FOR THE CLOSURE OF AN OPENING IN A CASING FORELECTRICAL COMPONENTS, PARTICURLARLY CAPACITORSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to an arrangement for the closure of an opening in a casing for electrical components, particurlarly capacitors, including a lid provided with a sealing ring, the lid engaging against an interior abutment in the casing.BACKGROUND ARTIn the type of casing mentioned here, there is often a need of the closure means being locked in place in a manner such that it has extremely good sealing. This is the case, inter alia, for electrolyte capacitor casings, which must not leak.Closure means known up to know have an unsatisfactory sealing function, particurlarly in the cases where the casing is subjected to high working temperatures, shocks or vibrations. In such cases the sealing elements used have been able to flex, the lid then lifting so that electrolyte leaks out and reduces the operational reliability of the capacitor.DISCLOSURE OF INVENTIONThe object of the present invention is therefore to provide a heat , shock , and vibration proof closure arrangement of the kind given in the introduction.This is obtained by the arrangement according to the invention having been given the characterizing features disclosed in claim 1.Further developments of the invention are apparent from the subordinate claims.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGThe invention is described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawing, where Figure 1 is a partial section through a preferred embodiment of the invention, andFigure 2 is a partial section through a modified embodiment of the invention.BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONFigure 1 is a partial section of a protective casing or jacket 1 for a schematically indicated electrolyte capacitor 2. The casing 1, which is preferably of metal, e.g. aluminium, has the form of a cylindrical body open at one end 3 the upper end in figures 1 and 2 , this opening being closed with the aid of a circular lid 4 of plastics or metallic material.On its upper face the lid 4 has a peripheral, annular recess 5, 6 of substantially rectangular cross section. The recess is formed by an annular bottom wall 5 in a plane substantially parallel to that of the lid, and a cylindrical side wall 6 forming an angle of about 900 with the bottom wall 5.Although the angle between the walls 5 and 6 in the illustrated, preferred embodiment is about 900, it is obvious that the angle can deviate more or less from 900.The bottom wall 5 constitutes the upper face of a radial flange 7. The upper and lower edges of this flange are chamfered about 450 to form two inclined abutment surfaces 8 and 9, which engage against the wall of the casing.An elastically or plastically deformable sealing ring 10, which may be of rubber or plastics, is inserted in the recess 5, 6 for engagement against the walls 5 and 6 thereof. The sealing ring 10 is retained in the recess by a folded over edge 11 of the casing 1.The casing 1 has an interior, substantially annular abutment surface 12, which sealingly engages against the lower abutment surface 9 of the flange 7. The abutment 12 is provided by a portion 13 of the casing is impressed along its circumference, suitably as a so called bead. The casing 1 also has an impression along a circumferencial portion 14 directly opposite the sealing ring 10, suitably in the form of a second bead. The ring 10 is thus compressed so that it forms a pressure transmitting mass pressing against both walls 5 and 6, i.e. both radially and axially, which results in urging the lid against the interior abutment 12 in the casing 1. In Figure 2, the casing 1 has enlarged wall thickness below the lid 4. The transition between the differently thick portions of the casing forms an interior abutment 12 , which conically diverges away from the opening 3. The abutment 12 corresponds to the abutment 12 in Figure 1. By the conicity of the abutment 12 there is obtained a cuneiform jointing effect between surface 9 and the abutment 12 .With the aid of the illustrated and described embodiments there is obtained a very reliable clamping of the lid as well as an improved sealing function in both axial and radial directions.
