## Description
PROCESSES FOR PRODUCING POSITIVE SELF DEVELOPED PHOTO RESIST PATTERNS This invention relates to processes for producing self developed positive photo resist patterns. Processes for producing self developed resist patterns, i.e.processes that do not require post exposure processing such as the application of a solvent or heat, have been sought for some time. The interest in such processes throughout the semiconductor industry stems from the potential they provide for higher throughput and higher yields.The higher yields result from both the reduction in process steps and the fact that such processes provide the potential for carrying out exposure, development, and pattern transfer etch, implant, or deposition under high vacuum, thereby reducing defects due to atmospheric contaminants, airborne particulate matter and development process. US A 3,915,704 discloses a process for producing a self developed pattern comprising exposing selected portions of a layer containing polyacetal to light. The layer also contains 1 a polymer capable of undergoing photo induced dehyrohalogenation and 2 an electron acceptor. Published European Patent application A1 66053, describes the use of excimer laser radiation in lithography. Self development is not possible with any of the materials which are mentioned in that application. The invention provides a self developing process using polyacetals without the need for any sensitizes According to one aspect of the invention, a process for producing a positive photo resist pattern comprising exposing selected portions of a polyacetal layer to radiation, is characterised, according to the invention, by the radiation being excimer laser radiation. According to another aspect of the invention, a process for producing a positive self developed photo resist pattern comprising exposing selected portions of a photo resist layer containing polyacetal to radiation, is characterised, according to the invention, by the photoresist layer consisting solely of polyacetal and the radiation being excimer laser radiation. Polyacetals useful in the present invention include those formed from aromatic dialdehydes such as phthalaldehyde and o formylphenylacetaldehyde, alkyl aldehydes, halogenated alkyl aldehydes and copolymers thereof. The most preferred polyacetal is from polymerized phthalaldehyde, capped with an acetyl group. By means of the present invention, the resist films are completely developed down to the substrate without the need for any additional processing such as heating, plasma etching or solvent development. To obtain this extremely advantageous result, it is necessary that the resist material be a polyacetal and the radiation be excimer laser radiation. We postulate that thermodynamically unstable polyacetal stabilized by end capping, unzips to the monomer upon exposure to high intensity excimer laser radiation to provide a self developing positive resist. This action is unique to the excimer laser exposure system.Excimer laser exposure of a wide range of other materials does not produce self development. Also, exposure of capped polyphthalaldehyde to low flux density mercury lamp radiation does not produce self development. The following example is given solely for the purpose of illustration and is not to be considered a limitation on the invention.Example Polyphthalaldyhydes were synthesized by anionic mechanism with any of several initiators under high vacuum and end capped with an acetyl group. Molecular weights Mw ranged from l.7xlO4 to 9. 7x104 with low dispersity 1.1 X 1.8 . The polymers were thermally stable to 1750C.Above that temperature, thermogravametric analysis TGA showed very sharp weight loss due to depolymerization and vaporization. In a typical process of the present invention, a polyacetal such as the polymer from phthalaldehyde capped with acetyl, was dissolved in cyclohexanone to make a 20 w vt solution, spin coated on silicon wafers at 2000 rpm for 30 seconds to give a 1 p thick films, and prebaked at 100do for 30 minutes. The films were imagewise exposed through a brick pattern mask to 40, 60 and 80 pulses of KrF excimer laser 2 radiation 249 nm at a flux of 66 mJ cm pulse. The pulse interval was 100Hz. Each exposure was completed within a second. The resist films were completely self developed to the substrate by the exposure without further processing such as heating, plasma etching and solvent development. Optical and scanning electron micrographs of the self developed resist patterns show that image qualities and resolution were excellent, and the films in the unexposed areas were unchanged.The invention has the additional advantage that the unexposed resist is stable to a variety of image transfer processes.
