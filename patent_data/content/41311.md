# Multilayer film manufacture utilizing scrap resin.

## Abstract
A novel system for producing film by extruding and or casting at least two layers of resin, 2,3 such as polyacrylonit rile homopolymer or interpolymers. The system provides for co extruding a continuous multi layer film with continguous or tandem dies 31,32 from a first supply of homogeneous resin solution 10 and a second supply of non homogeneous redissolved resin scrap 84 . The film 1 may be cast onto a smooth cooled drum surface 30 to form substantially con tinuous adjacent layers from two or more resin supplies. By stripping the film from the drum as a continuous film strip and stretching 50 the film an oriented structure is provided. Scrap resin, such as selvage trimmed from the stretched film or mill scrap, is comminuted 82 and redissolved in solvent 84 for recycle to the second supply 32 of the extrusion step. The homogeneous layer prevents film disruption by inhomogeneities present in the contiguous layer containing redissolved scrap, which might cause localized stresses in the film and discontinuities during stretching.
