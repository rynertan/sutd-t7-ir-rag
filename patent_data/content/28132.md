# METHOD OF PASSIVELY ADSORBING IMMUNO REACTIVE HAPTENS TO SOLID PHASES

## Abstract
The method comprises covalently binding an im muno reactive to a selected macromolecular carrier and then contacting the resulting hapten carrier conjugate at a selected concentration in a liquid phase with a selected solid phase until a desired amount of the hapten carrier conjugate is adsorbed to the surface of the solid phase. Unbound hapten carrier con jugate is then separated from the solid phase, and the solid phase containing the bound hapten carrier conjugate is rec overed for use in quantitative immunoassays and the like. The solid phase can be, for example, surfaces of a test tube or mic rotiter well or the like. The method is simple and inexpensive and permits hapten assays of improved sensitivity.
