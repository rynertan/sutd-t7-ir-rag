# A process for preparing esters of carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
Esters or carboxylic acids are prepared from olefins containing at least two carbon atoms by reacting the olefin with carbon monoxide in the presence of i a first complex of a selected Lewis acid with the ester or carboxylic acid, whichever is the reaction product recovered ii a second complex of the Lewis acid with an alcohol, if an ester is being prepared, or with water, if a carboxylic acid is being prepared and iii a metal carbonyl compound containing a Group IB transition metal in the first oxidation state and by recovering the reaction product s . The preferred olefin is propylene, the preferred ester to be prepared is methylisobutyrate, the preferred metal is copper and the preferred Lewis acid is boron trifluoride.
