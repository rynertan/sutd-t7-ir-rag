# Cooling arrangement for airfoil stator vane trailing edge.

## Abstract
A hollow, airfoil shaped stator vane 10, for a combustion turbine, is provided in its trailing edge portion with stag gered rows of pin fins 20, 22 and 24 and with longitudinal ribs 26 which provide the required stiffness for the thin wall design of the vane, the ribs being provided with protuber ances 36 in those locations where the turbulence inducing pin fins are displaced by the presence of the ribs.
