# A SYSTEM AND AN APPARATUS FOR LOCATING A GROUNDING FAULT ON ELECTRIC POWER EQUIPMENT

## Abstract
This invention concerns a system and an apparatus for locating a grounding fault on electric power equipment such as a power cable 11 . Optomagnetic sensors 12a, 12b are installed in spaced relation at each end of a section L of the cable 11 . Signals from the optomagnetic sensors are transmitted to associated light electricity conversion circuits 14a, 14b by means of associated optical fiber cables 13a, 13b . A discrimination circuit 15 determines whether or not a grounding fault has occurred, and where it has occurred, based on the output signals of the light electricity conversion circuits 14a, 14b . The determination is based on the magnetic level difference or phase difference between the latter output signals, or on a combination of the two.
