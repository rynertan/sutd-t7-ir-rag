# Undercoat composition and composite molded articles produced usin said compositon.

## Abstract
An undercoat composition for ceramic flame spraying and composite molded articles produced using the under coat composition are disclosed. The undercoat composition comprises an inorganic filler component having complex irregularities in the surface thereof and an organic binder component. The composite molded articles comprises a substrate, a ceramic flame sprayed coating, and an interme diate layer between the substrate and the ceramic flame sprayed coating, said intermediate layer being made of the above undercoat composition. The present undercoat com position permits good ceramic flame spraying, and there can be obtained composite molded articles having good impact resistance and environmental resistance.
