# Digital fluid flow control apparatus.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a generally cylindrical valve body 10 having a cylindrical axis. An inlet 27 to the valve has an axis extending radially from the cylindrical axis. An outlet 29 from the valve has an axis extending radially from the cylindrical axis in alignment with the inlet axis. A cylindrical manifold 20 is coaxially disposed in the valve body in a laterally displaced relationship with the inlet and outlet. An annular manifold 24 is coaxially dis posed in the valve body in laterally spaced relationship with the inlet and outlet. The annular manifold lies between the cylindrical manifold and the inlet and outlet and sur rounds a portion of the valve body. A passage 21, 25 extends through the valve body from the inlet to one of the manifolds. Another passage 30 extends through the valve body from the outlet to the other manifold. The passage to the cylindrical manifold passes through the portion of the valve body 31 surrounded by the annular manifold. A plu rality of digital bistable valve elements 40 connect the cy lindrical manifold and the annular manifold.
