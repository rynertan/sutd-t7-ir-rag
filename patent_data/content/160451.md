## Description
DIHYDROPYRIDINE 3,5 DICARBOXYLIC ACID ESTER DERIVATIVE ISOMERS, THEIR PREPARATION, AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM. This invention relates to a diastereoisomer of YM09730 defined below ,its dextro rotatory optical isomer,and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of these compounds it further relates to production of these compounds and also to medicaments using these compounds as effective component. YM 09730 is a dihydropyridine 3,5 dicarboxylic acid ester derivative shown by the following chemical structure, the chemical name of which is 2,6 dimethyl 4 3 nitrophenyl 1,4 dihydropyridine 3,5dicarboxylic acid 3 l benzylpyrrolidin 3 yl ester 5methyl ester.EMI1.1 YM 09730 was first synthesized by us, and has vasodilating and hypotensive activity of good durability U.5.Patent No.4,220,649 U.K.Patent No.2,014,134 . YM 09730 has two asymmteric carbon atoms, but there is no description of isomers in the above mentioned patents and the existence of isomers has not previously been confirmed. A pair of diasetereoisomers differ in absolute value of rotatory power and in m2qZ physical and chemical properties unlike general optical antipodes and hence if these properties are not clarified the isomers cannot be obtained separately on the basis of these property differences We have now succeeded in separating diastereoisomers A and B of YM 09730, and their individual optical isomers, and have discovered that isomer AN which term is applied equally herein to the diastereo isomer A and to the dextro rotatory optical isomer there of has greater specific pharmaceutical effects as compared to isomer B which term is applied equally herein to the diastereoisomer B and to optical isomers thereof or to a mixture YM 09730 of diastereoisomers A and B. The melting point of the hydrochloride of the diastereoisomer A is 200 to 2060C decomp. and the melting point of the hydrochloride of the dextrorotatory optical isomer thereof is 223 to 2300C decomp. . Accordingly, subjects of this invention are diastereoisomer A of YM 09730 and its dextrorotatory isomer identified by the melting points of their hydrochlorides and also pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts in this invention include malonates, oxalates, p nitrobenzoates, 2 ketoglutarates, maleates, 1malates, hydrochlorides, sulfates, p toluenesulfonates, phosphates and succinates. In the pharmacological experiments described below isomer A of this invention and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof gave a coronary blood flow increase 15 to 38 times that of diastereoisomer B and 14 to 35 times that of an equal mixture of diastereoisomers A and B on direct administration into the coronary arteries, which shows a high affinity of isomer A of this invention for the coronary arteries. On the other hand, isomer B showed almost the same effect as the mixture of the isomers. This means that the pharmacological action of YM 09730 is not a simple average of the actions of the isomers. It is new pharmacological knowledge that isomer A and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof have a high affinity for coronary arteries and this increases the possibility of the utilization of the compounds of this invention as medicaments The production of isomer A and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof ay be as follows I.Production of diastereoisomer A YM 09730 can be prepared by Hantzch s synthesis Ann. Chim., 215, 1 1882 as in Reference Exanple 1 below, giving a 1 1 mixture of diastereoiscner A and diastereoisomer B. Diastereoisomer A could then be obtained as follows a The mixture of the diastereoisomers was subjected to column chromatography using silica gel as the carrier and a mixed solution of ethyl acetate and acetic acid as the eluent,and diastereoisomer A was obtained from the initial eluate and diastereoisomerB from the later eluate. As silica gel carrier for the column chromatography, any silica gel conventional for the purpose can be used. Also, there is no particular stricticn on the mixing ratio of ethyl acetate and acetic acid used as the eluent, but usually the mixed solvent containing a small amount of acetic acid is used. The mixing ratio is e.g. 30 to 50 v v of ethyl acetate and about 1 to 10 v v of acetic acid and if the content of acetic acid is lowered, the eluting time of the desired compound is prolonged. The elution rate and the processing temperature can be selected as desired. b Another process, produces an acid addition salt of diastereoisomer A by convertino the mixture of the diastereoisomers to the acid addition salts and subjecting the mixture of the salts to fractional recrystallization. Suitable acid addition salts for use in this process are e.g. malonate, p nitrobenzoate , maleate etc. These acid addition salts are crystalline salts and the solubility in an organic solvent differs between diastereoisomer A and diastereoisomer B, thus allowing production of diasetereoisomer A by fractional recrystallization.A particularly suitable acid addition salt is malonateIn the case of using the malonate , crystals having a very high content of diastereoisomer A can be obtained by one recrystallization. Suitable solvents for use in the process are e.g. methanol, ethanol acetone, acetonitrile, etc. The acid addition salt of diastereoisomer A ofYM 09730 obtained by the above described process can be acid exchanged into another desired acid addition salt by conversion to free form and reaction with other acid. II. Production of dextro rotatory optical isomerA a The dextro rotatory optical issmer r diastereoismer A can be obtained by reacting the mixed free bases of diastereoisQsers A and B or the free base of the acid addition salt of diastereoisomer A of YM 09730 obtained by the process I above with L malic acid and then subjecting the product to optical resolution in conventional manner as described hereinafter. b In a more preferred process the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer A is separated from admixture of formula 1 below with the levo rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer BEMI7.1 wherein the wavelike bond means an bond or B bond, the bond shown by the dense arrow is a B bond, and the bond at the 3 position of the pyrroldine ring is a specific B bond . The raw material compound I can be produced i by reacting m nitrobenzaldehyde shown by formula II EMI7.2 S 3 acetoacetoxy 1 benzylopyrrolidine shown by formula III EMI8.1 and 3 aminocrotonic acid methyl ester shown by fornila IV EMI8.2 II by reacting nitrobenzaldehyde shown by formula 11 above, acetoacetic acid methyl ester shown by formula V CH COCH COOCH 3 cv and S 3 3 aminocrotonoyloxy 1 benzylpyrrolidine shown by formula WI EMI8.3 iii reacting S 1 benzyl 3 2 m nitrobenzylidene acetoacetoxy pyrrolidine shown by formula VII EMI8.4 obtained by previously reacting m nitrobenzaldehyde 1I above and S 3 acetoacetoxy l benzyl pyrrolidine III above and 3 aminocrotonic acid methyl ester IV above or iv reacting 2 m nitrobenzylidene acetoacetic acid methyl ester shown by formula VIII EMI9.1 obtained by previously reacting m nitrobenzaldehyde 11 and acetoacetic acid methyl ester V and S 3 3 amino cro tonoyloxy l benzyl pyrrolidine VI . These reactions proceed without use of solvent but it is advantageous to perform the reaction in a solvent which does not take part in the reaction, such as an alcohol, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, water, etc.The reaction is performed by heating a mixture of almost equimolar amountsof each component. The compound 1U or VI above can be obtained by reacting the compound V or . III with ammonium acetate and acetic acid in benzene and azeotropically dehydrating the product. The compound IV or . . VI thus obtained is supplied to reaction i or ii described above after being isolated or without being isolated from the reaction mixture. The compound VII or VIII which is the reaction product in the first step of process iii or iv can be supplied to the last step after being isolated once or without being isolated. The mixture of the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereososer A and the levo rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer B thus obtained is subjected to column chromatography using silica gel as the carrier and a mixture of ethyl acetate and acetic acid as the eluent to separate the dextro rotatory optical isomer or the mixture described above is reacted with L malic acid to form a mixture of the L malate of the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer A and the malate of the levo rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisoier B,and by fractionally recrystallizing the mixture the L malate of the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer A can be obtained. In the separation by column chromatography, the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer A is obtained from the first eluate and the levo rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer B can be obtained from the later eluate. As silica gel carrier, any silca gel which is generally used for column chromatography can be used. There is no particular restriction on the mixing ratio of ethyl acetate and acetic acid for use as the eluent but the mixed solvent containing a small amount of acetic acid is preferred. It is advantageous that the mixing ratio is 30 to 50 v v of ethyl acetate and about 1 to 10 v v of acetic acid and when the content of acetic acid is further lowered, the eluting time for the desired compound is prolonged. The eluting time and processing temperature can be selected as desired. The process of using L malic acid can also be utilized for the separation of the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer A by recrystallization since the L malate of the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer A is crystalline. Suitable solvents for use in the fractional recrystallization are e.g. methanol, ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, etc. The L malate of the dextro rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer A thus obtained can be used as a zedicament, but can be converted to the acetate or other suitable salt, if necessary, by treating with base to form the free compound and treaty this with appropriate acid. By hydrolyzing the levo rotatory optical isomer of diastereoisomer B separated in the above process, S l benzyl 3 hydroxypyrrolidine can be recovered and the pyrrolidine can be reused as raw material for producing the compound of formula I . The pharmacological activities,acute toxicity and clinical doses of compounds according to the invention are illustrated by the following tests. 1 Coronary vasodilating effect in anesthetized dogs In open chest dogs anesthetized with 30 mg kg i.v. of pentobarbital sodium, arterial blood from the carotid artery was led to the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery by extracorporeal loop.A servocootrolled pump model 1215D, HarvardApparatus was incorporated in the circuit to maintain a constant perfusion pressure of 120 mmHg by means of a pump controller SCS 22, Data GraphCo., Thkuya Tukada et al., Folia Pharmacol. Japon, 74, 59p, 1978 . An electromagnetic flow probe of extracorporeal type MF 25, Nihon Koden was also inserted in the circuit to record coronary blood flow. A dose of 1 g of test compound was administered directly into the coronary artery and then coronary blood flow was monitored until the blood flow returned to the pretreatment value. The area under the curve for percent increase in coronary blood flow after the intracoronary injection was calculated and used as an index of the overall increase in coronary blood flow. Results are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Coronary vasodilating activity in anesthetized dogs Overall increase Duration of in coronary blood action flow at lpg , min.

Such a high affinity for the coronary artery and long durability indicate that the isomer A hydrochloride is useful for the treatment of coronary artery disease such as angina pectoris. 2 Bypotensive effect in anesthetized rats Blood pressure was measured in urethaneanesthetized rats. Test compound was intravenously administered in an increasing dose manner at interval of 2Q minutes, The dose of each compound required to lower mean blood pressure by 30 mmHg ED 30 nBg was calculated from the dose response curves and is shown in Table 2.

Test compound was suspended in 0.5 methylcellulose solution and administered orally to mice. The LD50 values of the compounds were calculated by the method of Litchfield Wilcoxon Journal of Pharmacol. Exp. Therap., 96, 99 113, 1949 and are shown in Table 3. Table 3.
