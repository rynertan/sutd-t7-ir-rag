# ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE COMPOSITES COMPRISING P DOPED ACETYLENE HAVING CONDUCTIVE COATINGS AND CONJUGATED AROMATIC POLYMERS AND PROCESS THEREFOR

## Abstract
This invention is directed to electrically conductive composites comprising a p doped acetylene polymer having conductive coatings of conjugated aromatic poly mers, particularly polypyrrole and polythiophene. The coat ings are applied by an electrochemical deposition process which is either simultaneous with, or subsequent to, elec trochemical p doping of the acetylene polymer. The com posite materials can exhibit greater environmental stability than does the p doped acetylene polymer per se.
