# Method and system for analyzing discontinuities in reasonably homogeneous medium.

## Abstract
According to the method signals adapted to the medium and to the kind of discontinuitv to be analyzed are transmit ted towards the discontinuity D from a number of transmit ting point 1₁ located on at least one base line L₁ , these signals are received at a number of reception points I₂ located on at least one base line L₂ placed on the opposite side of the discontinuity D as far as the transmission paths are concerned the received signals are then analyzed to obtain the position and shape of the discontinuity. In certain cases the echos and backscatter are also analyzed. At least one of the base lines F₁ carrying the transmis sion points I₁ does not intersect with at least one of the other base lines F₂ carrying the reception points I₂ . This system and method may be used to determine the position and shape of underground discontinuities, to analy ze the internal structure of human or animal bodies, or any other inanimate object in any medium.
