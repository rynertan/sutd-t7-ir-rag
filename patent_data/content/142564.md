# SHUTTER APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A shutter apparatus is constructed such that a plurality of panels 2 thereof are lifted or lowered to open or close an opening, and are arranged in a housing box 5 , when stored, with the panels 2 folded parallel to each other. In order to lift or lower the panels smoothly and silently, and prevent prob lems such as the jamming of the panels 2 , part of each panel 2 engages with a panel lifting means 3 such as a chain which lifts or lowers the panels 2 to open or close the open ing. A sensor device 7 which detects slacking displacement of the panel lifting means 3 , a panel guide 11 which is tilted diagonally upward, and chain sprocket disengagement plates 9 , 10 which come into contact with the panel lifting means 3 in the vicinity of the teeth of a sprocket wheel 8 are provided in the vicinity of a guide rail 1 . When the panels 2 are stored, they are folded up and suspended from a support rail 4 . This shutter apparatus can be employed for an open ing such as a garage opening, a show window or an ordinary window.
