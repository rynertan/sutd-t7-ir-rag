## Description
VALVES WAVING REMOVABLE SEATS. This invention relates to valves and particularly valves comprising in combination a body, a seat member within the body, a closure member adapted to sealingly engage the seat member to close the valve against fluid flow therethrough and movable away from the seat member to permit fluid flow, the seat member being removably mounted in said body. The seat member in such valves is substantially load bearing and is designed so as to be removable for renewal or maintenance. Prior art valves having a removable seat member have generally been of complicated construction and replacement of the seat member has been a difficult and time consumlng operation. In addition difficulty has been found reliably mounting the sect member to resist operating loads without distorting. An object of the present invention is to provide a means to secure such a seat member against normal operating loads whilst providing also a simple means for replacement. The invention provides a valve of the type described in which the seat member is connected to the body by means of a plurality of locking members releasably engaged with both the seat member and the body and disposed to transmit to the body closing forces exerted on the seat member by the closure menber. Preferably the body and the seat member are configured to define jointly a channel in which the plurality of locking members are located.Conveniently the channel may be defined by cooperating grooves formed in the body and the seat member, the grooves being semi circiilar to define an annular channel. The locking members may then be balls, and suitably sufficient balls are provided to substantially fill the channel.The balls may be metal or plastics, or a combination of balls of these two materials may be used. The balls may be introduced into and removed from the channel through an access opening in the body, the access opening normally being closed by a plug. The invention is particularly applicable to valves of plastics or reinforced composite materials of construction where means for adequately locking load bearing members constitutes a general problem given the generally low tensile and shear properties of the material. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a longitudinal section of a valve in position in a pipeline. The valve shon in the drawing by way of example is a non return valve of the springactuated type, but it is to be understood that the invention is also applicable to securing a removable seat member in valves of other types, for example butterfly and ball valves. Referring to the drawing, a valve body 2 is located in a pipeline by flanges 3 and 4 which are connected by bolts 5 so as to clamp the valve body between them. A valve closure member 6 is biased against a seat 7 by a spring 8 which is located on a support 9 integrally connected to the valve body 2 by a spider 10. When fluid flow in the direction of the arrow exerts a pressure against the closure member 6 greater than that of the spring 8 the valve opens, and when the pressure exerted by the fluid is less than that of the spring 8 the valve closes by reason of the spring 8 forcing the valve member 6 into sealing engagement with the seat member 7, as will be readily understood. a seat member 7 is a member separate from the valve body 2, and can be removed therefrom for renewal or maintenance. A semi circular groove 11 is formed around the periphery of the seat member 7 and a similar groove 12 is formed in the wall of the valve body 2. When the seat ember 7 is mounted in the body 2, the two grooves 11 and 12 are disposed adjacent each other and co operate to define an annular channel 13. The seat member 7 is connected to the body 2 by a plurality of balls 14 located within the channel 13. Sufficient balls 14 are positioned in the channel 13 to substantially fill the channel, and it will readily be seen how the closing forces exerted on the seat member 7 by the closure member 6 are transmitted by the balls 14 to the body 2 of the valve and are evenly distributed about the periphery of the seat member.Concentrations of stress at specific areas are substantially avoided by this construction. An 0being or similar seal 15 is clamped between the inner axial end of the seat member 7 and the body 2 to prevent leakage of fluid between the opposed faces of the seat member 7 and the body 2. The body 2 is provided with an access opening 16 communicating with the channel 13, the opening 16 normally being closed by a plug 17 of a suitable plastics material or by a grub screw. In order to unlock the connection between the seat member 7 and the valve body 2 to enable the seat member 7 to be removed, the plug 17 is released from the opening 16 and the balls 14 are allowed to run out through the opening 16. The seat member 7 can then be removed. Replacement and relocking of the seat member 7 is the reverse of this procedure, namely the seat member 7 after reconditioning, or a new seat member, is placed within the valve body 2, and balls 14 are run into the channel 13 through opening 16 until they substantially fill the channel, whereupon the plug 17 is replaced The valve shown is of typical reinforced composite material construction. The balls 14 may be metal, or of plastics which can provide cost saving. Alternatively, some of the balls 14 may be metal and others may be plastics.
