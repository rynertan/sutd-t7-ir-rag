# Endoprosthetic bone joint components.

## Abstract
A prosthetic component 20 30 for replacing a region of a bone including an articular surface 12 of a joint has a first surface shaped to approximate the articular surface, and a second surface 23 33 shaped to extend substantially perpendicularly to the principal trabecular structure 10, 11 in a section through the bone when the first surface replaces the articular surface. In the case of a long bone the second surface is preferably shaped to approximate the fused epiphyseal plate scar 15 of the bone region in question. Also the component preferably has varying elastic modulus, at least in the portion thereeof bordering the second surface, to simulate that of the bone replaced thereby.
