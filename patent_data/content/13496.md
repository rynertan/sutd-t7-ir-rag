# Warning lamp arrangements for vehicle battery charging systems.

## Abstract
Three resistors 16, 17, 18 connect a point 19 to the output terminals of an alternator stator winding 10 . The said point 19 is connected to the positive terminal of the battery 12 through a resistor 20 and to its negative terminal through a zener diode 34 and a resistor 35 . A pair of com parators 21, 22 having their outputs connected to the base of a Darlington transistor 28, 30 detect if the voltage at the said point 19 is outside a predetermined range. The junction of the zener diode 34 and its associated resistor 35 is also connected to the base of the Darlington transistor 28, 30 . A waning lamp 32 connected in tho collector circuit of the Darlington transistor is energised if the alternator does not produce an output or a malfunction occurs in the charging system.
