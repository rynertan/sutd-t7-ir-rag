# Electronic switching circuit for use in magnetic head drives.

## Abstract
An electronic switching circuit coupled between a magnetic head driving circuit 3 and transducing windings 7 utilizing an electronic switch 6 whose internal resistance changes substantially linearly in response to an increasing or decreasing control signal. Particularly useful in magnetic bias recording or erase circuits to eliminate erase of useful information and recording of disturbing noise spikes due to induced high frequency noise signal when the switch is activated.
