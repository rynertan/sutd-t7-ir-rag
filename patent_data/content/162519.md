## Description
Intermediate driving gear with facilities for measuring and controlling a torque.The invention relates to an intermediate driving gear, fitted into a drive system, e.g. for a vehicle with a hybrid drive comprising an engine motor and a flywheel, the transmission ratio of which dependent on the mass inertias and velocities of both the flywheel and the vehicle, can be controlled by an element in such a manner that kinetic energy is transmitted from the flywheel to the vehicle and in the reverse direction.It is known that a transmission with a continuously variable transmission ratio has to be employed when a flywheel system is used for energy storage, because, if the energy stored in the flywheel is used to accelerate the vehicle, the speed of the flywheel will decrease as a result of the energy extracted when the driving speed is increased, i.e. when the speed of the driven shaft increases.This is only possible when a transmission with a continuously variable transmission ratio is employed in the driving circuit between the flywheel and the driven shaft.A continuously variable transmission of this kind can be achieved by means of, inter alia, a generator electric motor combination or a hydraulic pump hydraulic motor combination, or as a mechanical transmission. In such driving systems, synchronisation problems occur owing to the speed difference between the rotating parts, to the mass of the said parts, and to the speed of synchronisation desired.For a mechanical continuously variable transmission, adjustment of the precise transmission ratio is especially difficult. Accurate setting of the transmitted torque by measurment of the said torgue and s subsequent adjustment of the continuously variable transmission are necessary. Moreover, large losses of efficiency occur when the parts of the drive system between which speed differences occur are coupledParticularly in the version incorporating a generator and an electric motor, the relatively large weight and total volume are also appreciable drawbacks.The invention aims at overcoming the above drawbacks in a simple manner and to that end it is characterised by the fact that the intermediate driving gear is formed by a planetary gear system, the sun gear of which is mounted on the flywheel shaft and the planet gears of which, the planet carrier of which is connected to the said transmission, engage in an annular gear which is coupled by means of a friction clutch with an outer gear suspended with reciprocating motion in a housing to which a measuring element is fitted in order to absorb and measure the force of the torque applied thereto, which force acts as the regulating variable for setting the said regulating element. The present intermediate driving gear has three functions 1 to measure the transmitted torque in the driving gear both with and without slip. The measured value is used to set another element in a driving gear, e.g. a continuously variable mechanical transmission or the desired speed of an engine so as to ensure a favourable fuel consurrqrtiosl 2 to act as a slipping clutch or synchronization coupling between two large rotating masses, in which case the torque can be chosen as a function of different quantities, namely T F time , T F temperature or T F position of accelerator pedal .The slip of the clutch can be used in starting, as a safequard against overload, or as an emergency brake for one of the rotating masses 3 to reduce the speed with the aid of a planetary gear train, two elements of the said gear train being used as the input and output shaft, respectively. In the present assemblies, these elements are the sun gear and the planet carrier. The third element of the planetary gear system, in this case the annular gear, is used as a reaction element which is connected to the housing via a disc clutch and a floatingly supported outer drum. The speed reduction can thus in fact be continuously varied between zero and infinity.The present invention is compact and has been developed for the hybrid driving gear of a bus, the assembly being mounted between the flywheel and, for example, a continuously variable mechanical transmission. The three above mentioned functions are all employed in the hybrid driving gear the torque signal, for example, is used to control the continuously variable transmission and the power distribution to two power sources or to two brake systems.The assembly can be placed between a power unit internal combustion engine, electric motor and a tool or machine. The starting up of the latter can be controlled in accordance with a desired characteristic.The assembly can be inserted between two rotating masses of a machine press, roller, etc. or of a vehicle which have to be synchronized.The present invention can also be employed in the automatic transmission system of a vehicle, where an accurate torque signal is required to set the engine speed and or the reduction ratio of tbe transmission in order to achieve minimum fuel consumption.A planetary reduction driving gear has been chosen, in which the outer gear is braked by a finely controlled friction clutch. The presence of tile planetary driving gear makes it possible to measure the torque on a stationary element, which considerably simplifies easuresent. Application of the present invention ensures optimum efficiency of the hybrid driving gear and a compact construction.The invention will now be further explained with the aid of the drawings.Fig. 1 shows schematically a partial longitudinal section of the present intermediate driving gear.Fig. 2 shows a cross section, viewed along arrows II II, of fig. 1. Fig 3 shows schematically a possible application of the invention in a flywheel driving gear.The intermediate driving gear 1, which is fitted between a flywheel and a continuously variable, in the present case mechanical, transmission consists of a flywheel shaft 2 on which sun gear 3 is mounted. The planet gears 4, which are mounted on a planet carrier 5 and engage with the said sun gear, are also in engagement with an annular gear 6. The elatter has longitudinal grooves 7, in which the inner circumferences of the plates of a friction clutch 8 engage.This clutch will preferably take the form of a wet plate clutch which can be finely controlled. The outer circumference of the clutch is in engagement with longitudinal grooves 14 in an outer gear 9, which is suspended with reciprocating movement 11 in a housing 10. A measuring element 12 is fitted on the outer gear 9 by means of a supporting element 13, the force exerted on the said measuring member by the torque to be measured being converted in known fashion into a signal which is fed to the element which controls the transmission ratio of the transmission. The clutch is fitted with a sinusoidal spring 15 and an annular collar 16. The planet carrier 5 is connected with the continuously variable transmission in a manner enabling it to rotate.Fig. 3 shows a schematic example of a possible embodiment of the invention in a flywheel driving gear. The intermediate driving gear 1 is on the one hand rotatably connected with the shaft 2 of flywheel 17 via a friction clutch 18 and on the other hand connected with a continuously variable mechanical transmission 19 via a shaft 20. This transmission is provided with an adjusting element 21 which, depending on the torque measured by the measuring element 12, sets the transmission ratio of the transmission 19 via the primary discs 23 of the latter. The signal from the torque meter is, if necessary, converted in a signal converter 22 into a quantitiy suitable for the control system and this quantity is compared in a comparing element not shown with the said quantity. The adjusting element 21 subsequently sets the primary discs 23 in proportion to the signal value difference. The friction clutch 8 is also set as a function of this value.
