# Nickel complexes in diol solvents and their use as part of a catalyst in the oligomerization of ethylene.

## Abstract
Ethylene is oligomerized to even numbered alpha mono olefins principally in the C₄ to C₄₀ range with minimal concomitant production of high molecular weight polyethylene by reacting ethylene in a diol solvent in an oligomerization reactor at elevated pressure with a nickel complex catalyst composition produced by combining in the oligomerization reactor a a stable preformed complex of nick el, ethylene and hydride in an aliphatic diol solvent, said complex being prepared by contacting in the diol solvent and in the pres ence of ethylene, a simple divalent nickel salt, a base and a boron hydride reducing agent, and b a bidentate ligand the stable nickel complex solution and the bidentate ligand being added in separate portions to the oligomerization reactor. These stable complexes of nickel, ethylene and hydride in diol solution are considered to be novel oligomerization catalyst precursor com positions.
