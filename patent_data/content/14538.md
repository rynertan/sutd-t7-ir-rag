# Manufacturing and handling cable seals for assembly in cable terminations.

## Abstract
Cable seals 40 of the type employed in sealed electrical connectors are maintained in a predetermined orientation throughout manufacture and handling of same whereby the cable seals 40 may be presented in a usable form to automa tic assembly equipment for manufacture in cable lead termi nations employed in such connectors. According to the method of the invention, the cable seals 40 are integrally molded in a belt 54 which provides a handleable product with the seals being maintained by the belt in a predetermined orientation. The cable seals then are punched from the belt 54 and simultaneously inserted into a carrier 62 for subse quent handling while still maintaining the cable seals orien tated for use such as in automatic assembly equipment.
