# A phase changing circuit.

## Abstract
A phase changing circuit in a logic circuit including an ECL circuit 11 which has a plurality of emitter output circuits 3, 4 . One emitter output circuit 3 is used as the normal output 15 . At least one other emitter output circuit 4 is given an additional capacitor 13 . The emitter output circuit 4 with the additional capacitor 13 is connected to an emitter output portion of a separately provided control ECL circuit 12 . An input 16 control level of the control ECL circuit 12 is changed so as to change the output level of the control ECL circuit 12 . In accordance with whether the output level of the control ECL circuit 12 is low or high, the capacitor 13 is connected to the normal output 15 of the ECL circuit 11 . When the capacitor 13 is connected to the normal output 15 of the ECL circuit 11 , the signal propagation from the input 14 to the normal output 15 is delayed by the capacitor 13 .
