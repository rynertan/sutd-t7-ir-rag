# Electrochemical etching of high voltage aluminium anode foil.

## Abstract
Aluminium electrolytic capacitor foil of a high cubic texture etched by passing the foil through an electrolyte bath containing 3 hydrochloric acid and 1 aluminum as aluminum chloride under the influence of a direct current and at a temperature of 75 C. The foil thus etched has a significantly higher capacitance resulting from a greater density of tunnels, an elongation of the tunnels, and a fairly linear tunnel structure in the foil.
