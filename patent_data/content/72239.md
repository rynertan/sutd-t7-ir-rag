# A method of and apparatus for repairing a leak in a pipe or pipeline.

## Abstract
A flexible wrapping 14 is adapted to fit around a section of pipe or pipeline 10 requiring repair. The wrap ping has inner and outer skins 15 and 16 and a plurality of tags 17 for limiting the separation between the skins. The wrapping 14 is sealed in position around the pipe or pipeline by means of straps 24, 25, 29 . A mould forming material 37 is introduced through a filler 30 into the space between the skins and then allowed to solidify. A sealant 36 is then introduced under pressure through an injector 32, into the mould space between the inner skin 15 and the pipe or pipeline 10 . A pressure gauge indi cates the pressure in the mould space. Gases may escape from the mould space through a vent 33 .
