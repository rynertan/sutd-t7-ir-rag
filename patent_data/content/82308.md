## Description
This invention concerns a process for manufacturing metal furnituresor other metal furnishing components, formed b a tubolar frame and by at least one element defining a hearing or sup porting surfaca, said element being constituted by a series of tubular bodies, h a rod grating and or by a continuous or punched , and being welded to the tube in correspondence with its terminal area or areas in contact witl the tubular frame.The invention atso concerns furnituresor other furni shing components obtained with tile process according to the invention and constituting a neu industrial products. The manufacture of metal furniture is carried out starting from a frame made of tubolar components, having anx suitable section, to which an element defining at least a hearing or supporting surface is welded. The latter element can have the most different shapes for exemple it can consist of a series of tubular bodies, spaced and parallel to each other, with their end fizzed b welding to the supporting frame, said bodies being, on their turn, designed to support other components, made of different material and fizzed in a removable way, for instance coverings in plastic material, which complete the piece of furniture or the furnishing component. In other cases, the bearing or supporting element is formed by a rod grating, previously formed by welding, for instance projectioll welding, cut to size and applied by welding its ends to the tul lsslar frame Finally, another possibility for the bearing or supporting element is constituted by a plate, eventually punched according to whatever desired design, which is on its turn, cut to size and fixed bs eldiiig, in its parts resting on the frame.The weldcd semifinished product so obtained is completed, if necessary, with wuitable operations of shaping and application of other components, for example, supporting legs and arms in tise case of a chair, supporting legs in tile ctase r L1 o table and so on, after which the assembl is sent for plastification, which of course must be performed in a kay as to ensure a complete protection of all exposed surfaces.All the present techniques for welding the bearing or supporting element to the tubular frame show drawbacks, both for what concerns the necessary working stages and for what concerns the static resistance of the finished product, and finall for what refers to keeping the protection cliarcteristcs assigned to the product with the subsequent operation of plastification. In fact, for example in the case of a bearing or supporting element formed by a series of tubular bodies, extending perpendicularly to the frame to which they must be welded, the present technique considers the flattening of the ends of the tubular bodies and their welding in correspondence with the lower surface of the frame, said technique being necessary owing to the fact that this kind of bearing or supporting element is generally used for the formation of supporting surfaces and is therefore designed to support a part of plastic material fixed to the tubular bodies , These latter, in order to improve the component outward appearance, must Ire fixed to the lower part of the tubular frame, opposite to the pait shouing said supporting surface. This solution necessarity in olts sselKling difficulties due to tile curved surfaces of the 1 tubular flame, but above all it is such that the weldess points tend to open or to break away when the furnishing Clement inpartiaular a chair or the like that the static forces acting on samt are such as to cause the separation of tle yielded components. this condition results to be particularly serious, in that the subsequent operation of plastification, does not allow the plastics to penetrate in the best way into the gaps of the reciprocally welded areas and forms a layer which can easily break during the use of the product, leading therefore to rapid degradation of same due to the formatioll of oxidation points. The same thing occurs when eluding is performed bet keen a tubular frame andarod grating. In this case, welding is carried out as usual by projection and the operation necessarily requires, after weldIng, an operation of cutting and finishing those parts of the grating pro truding with respect to the tubular frame surface, both for aesthetic and practical reasons. Under these conditions, too, the operation of plastification is not performed under optimal conditions and can easily lead to a not perfect application of the plastic material into the gaps near the welded areas and asily involves breaking of the protective layer of plastic material. Finally, when the bearing or supporting element is formed by a plate, the present manufacturing technique, after the shearing of said plate, comprises a drawing stage to adapt the edges of said plate to the configuration of the tubular frame, a projection welding and then a final flanging stage of said plate. The plate is generally welded to get elne extension to partial follow the surface of tile tubulen frame or it is bent in advance at its edges, approximately according to an angle of 90 , and said bentis part is welded.In any case, besides said working cdifficulties, the same previously mentioned drawbacks relating to manufacture and duration in time of the best protecting conditions given by the pl astic latter are still present. This invention proposes a new process for the industrial manufacture of furniture of said type, which alloys to simulta neousls achieve a series of advantapes, impossible to be obtained up to not with the hnou n techniques, said advantages comprising an improvement in the static conditions of the product, a reduction of the necessary manufacturing stages, with elimination or simplification of some of t sem, an improvement of the finishing for a better and more uniform distribution of the protective plastic layer and for keeping the characteristics of same unaltered even in the long use of the product, and finally an improvement of its outward aspect and the possibility of obtaining new products. All these advantages are obtained b means of a process of the type defined hereinabove, which, according to the invention, is essentially characterized by the following stages forming al least part of the frame with shaped tunes ilavillg at least a plane surface, placing area or areas of the bearing or supporting element in contact witlm the plane surface of the components of tile tubular frame and gelding by projection said terminal areas onto the plane surface The invention also concerns a metal piece of furniture or furnishing component, which is obtained by carryng out the above described process and shows new structural and aesthetic features as better examined later on. The following description of preferred embodiments of the invention, given as mere examples, will point out the advantages of the process and of the products according to the invention, in relation to what previously known and hereinabove described. In the drawing Figures 1 and 2 are partial peispective cross sectional views of two possible embodiments of the components of the tubular frame, forcarring out the process according to the invention. Figures 3 to 6 are partial perspective views of the methods of application and fixing different possible bearing or supporting elements to a tubular frame according to the invention, all the figures being partial perspective views. Figures 7 and 8 are diagrammatic cross section al views sho wing the application of a protecting plastic layer on the components of the preceding figures. Figures 9 and 10are perspective view illustrating tIe methods fir bending the components oI the frame according to the invention. Referring to figures 1 and 2 two possible components ot a tubular frame forming the support for furniture or furnishing components manufactured according to the invent ion are sllots As already said, said components of tubular frame must have at least a plane surface. Preferably they are constituted by a drain tubolar element 10 sith circular section or by a drawn tubular element 12 with oval section directly obtained w ith a protruding side fin 14 or 16, which can be advantageously off centered with respect to the diameter 18 or to the transversal axis 20 of the section, to which said fin 14 or 16 is parallel.The tubular elements can be obtained without difficulty for instance b cold drawing and have only slightly higher manufacturing cost than tubes without fin 14 or 16, but they give, as it will 1 be seen, advantages which widel compensate this slighthly higher cost. As figures 1 and 2 immediately show, said tubes present, with respect to equal tubes with merely circular or oval section, a first advantage due to the presence of the fin 14 or 16, which causes an increase of the moment of inertia of said tubes and therefore cooperates to improve the static resistance of the tubes and consequently of the finished product. Figures 3,4,5 and 6 illustrate the welding operation of different bearing or supporting elements to tubes 10 of the type illustrated in figure 1. In figure 3, the fin 14 is placed in the upper position, namely towards the position at sight of the with piece or component of furniture.The grating 22 is welded kits that vid of its transversal rods 24 in correspondence to tulle upper surface of the fin 14, said welding being pz in a way known in itself by projection. lt can be immedialely seen that the rec procal disposition of tile tin 14 and prating 22 allows to eliminate the operations of trimming and grinding the ends of transversal rods 24, necessar with the known production techniques, that welding covers to a considerable extent the fin 14 and tile part of plane surface of same, assuring therefore a better reliability, and finally that, as the product is manufactured considering that loads acting on the gratis 22 kill act from upside down in figure, a structure with better static resistance is obtained. In figure 4, the tubular component 10 is positioned to get its fin 14 to be oriented in the lower part of same, that is in the part opposite to the part of the product at sight. The previously flattened ends of several tubular bodies 26 are fixed to the upper surface of the fin 14 said tubular bodies 26 being on their turn designed to support a covering element, for instance made of plastic material, which is fastened to the tubular bodies 26 and fills the plane defined by said latter bodies and the plane tangent upside to the tulle 10.In this case, too, easy projection welding is obtained on large surfaces in contact and with such reciprocal disposition of the tubular bodies 26 and fin 14 tliat tile static stresses exercised on the product, still from upside down in figure, are such as not to tend to cause separation of the welded pieces, nor, as it will he better seen later on, breaking of the plastified surface later In figures 5 and 6, the tubular element 10, positioned for instance with its fin 14 in tlu upper part, is coupled to a plate 28 with possible lloles 32. The plate 28 can be welded by projection in the upper part or in the lower part of the fin 14, as illustrated in figures 5 and 6 respectively.The first configuration allows letter resistance to static stress exercised from upside down, while the second configuration resists to stress exercised from down upwards and if part at sight of the furnishing component is the upper one, a better outward aspect of the product i s obtained in case the holes 30 are on the terminal area of the plate 28. As compartd to the traditional procedure, in this case there is the advantage of eliminating the drawing and flanging of plate 28, also obtaining a better finishing of the product as it will be seen in the description of the following figures 7 and 8. According to said figures 7 and 8, the tubular component 10 presents its fin 14 fixed to the rods 24 or to the plate 28, or to the tubutar bodies 26 respectively. In both cases, the immersion of the previously heated product into powdered plastic material, according to the presently used plastification technique, allows to apply a plastic layer 32 which completely and safely covers the whole welded joint, as tile powder easily penetrates into the gaps Iwet zeen tile welded parts.Moreover, as indicated by arrows 34 in figures 7 and , the reciprocal disposition of the fins 14 and bearing or supporting element wcldvd to saitf fins is sucti that the stress exercised on the latter is discharged on the fin 14, and actions of reciprocal separation between the welded parts are not exercised. this advantage positi vely affects not only the static resistance of the product, but also and ahoX C all the finishing of same, in shat the protective superficial layer 32 of plastic material is capable of perfectly resisting to the stress usually exercised on the product without cracking and therefore without allowing oxidation to begin. As it will become obvious to Those skilled in the art the fact of envisaging the presence of the supporting surface for the projection welding between components of the supporting tubular frame and of the element defining the bearing or supporting surface, in furniture or similar furnishing components, allows to obtain an outward aspect of tle product better than th obtained with the known industrial processes and opens the way to the study of new products. 711e onl limitation is due tothe fact that, in the case where the tubular component of the frame, for example the tube 1O, has to be bent, before or after being welded to the supporting element of same, its fin 14 must necessarily be paral el, before and after the bending operation, to the rotation axis, as indicated in figure 9 at 36 of intersection of sane with the plane of the figure. In this case, it is possible to bend the tubes without any problem, keeping said advantageous working conditions of the product unaltered.For example, figure 10 schematically illustrates a corner of a chair, in which 1 the tubular frame has been bent as previousI, said, together with the plate 28. This product, like the other, ones can he completed with the application of other elements, in particular other elements of the frame which, not requiring a projection welding to parts of the supporting elements, can have a simple tubular configuration. The above mentioned examples, of course, are not at all intended as covering all possibilities of application and embodiment of the invention, particularly in that concerns the configuration of the components of frame 10 and 12 as swell as the structure and configuration of the bearing or supporting element
