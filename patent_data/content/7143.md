# Apparatus and method for cycling a material in hydride dehydride systems.

## Abstract
Moving bed hydride heat pumps and pressure pumps are described in which a hydride forming material is transported between two or more reactor vessels 21,23 . Each vessel can be maintained at a predetermined temperature, and thus, the hydride forming material may be heated or cooled by moving it into an appropriately heated or cooled reactor vessel 21,23 . In this way thermal cycling of reactor vessels is reduced or eliminated. Both continuously operating and mov ing batch hydride pumping systems are disclosed.
