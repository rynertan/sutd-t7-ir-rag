# Apparatus for facilitating alignment of a group of cyclically switched light transmitters or receivers with a single light receiver or transmitter.

## Abstract
An adjustment device for aligning a group of cyclically switched transmitters or receivers with a single receiver or transmitter of the kind in which a series of spatially spaced beams pass between the transmitters and the receiver, or alternatively between the transmitter and the receivers. In a preferred form the adjustment device is used to ensure alignment of a row of infra red transmitters 0 9 which direct beams of light to a photoelectric converter 18 arranged at the focus of a concave mirror 24 . The adjustment device features a coincidence circuit 14 15 the outputs from which indicate that signals transmitted from the end transmitters of the row are received at the photoelectric converter. The outputs are used to energise respective adjustment indicating lamps 19 20 . In a particularly preferred arrangement threshold circuitry 17 is used to produce winking of the lamps when approximate adjustment has been achieved continuous lighting of the lamps shows that accurate adjustment is present. The lamps can conveniently be placed adjacent their associated transmitters.
