## Description
Novel phenyl piperidinesDESCRIPTIONTechnical fieldThe present invention is related to new substituted phenylpiperidines, to processes for preparing such compounds as well as to pharmaceutical preparations thereof and methods of treatment employing such compounds.An object of the invention is to provide compounds for therapeutic use, especially having a therapeutic activity as cardiac agents.Background ArtIn Chemical Abstracts 69 86776s citing Julia, M. et al.,Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 1968, 3 , 1000 7 compounds under the general formulaEMI1.1 are described. Among the compounds mentioned are compounds wherein R1 represents m OCH3 and R11 represents H, CH3, C2H5, CH2C6H5, CH2CH2C3H5 or CH2CH2C6H4NO2 p and whereinRÚ represents m OH and RÚÚ represents CH2CH2C6H5 or CH2CH2C6H4N02 p . Said compounds were prepared for investigation of pharmacological properties. Swiss Patent 526,536 describes compounds under the formulaEMI2.1 wherein R1 represents H or OH and R11 represents H. The compounds are claimed to have useful pharmacological properties especially as broncholytic agents.DE OLS 2 621 535 and 2 621 536 describe compounds ofEMI2.2 wherein XI is hydrogen or an acyl group and R1 is H or an alkyl, alkenyl or phenylalkyl group. The compounds are claimed to have dopaminergie properties.Disclosure of InventionAccording to the present invention it has been found that novel compounds of the formulaEMI2.3 wherein R is an alkyl group having 1 5 carbon atoms, a hydroxyalkyl group having 2 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl part and having the hydroxy group bound in a position other than the 1 position, or an alkenyl group having 3 5 carbon atoms other than a l alkenyl group, as bases and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, have useful pharmacological properties. Especially, the compounds are useful for treatment of cardiac diseases.Thus, the compounds of formula I have an ability of increasing the contractility of the heart muscle of an animal. Thus, the compounds have a positive inotropic cardiac effect, rendering them useful for treatment of cardiac diseases in animals including man. Further, among the compounds of formula I are compounds having a positive inotropic cardiac effect, substantially lacking positive chronotropic effect. The compounds of formula I are thus especially useful for treatment of cardiac insufficiency or cardiac failure and other conditions wherein an increase in heart contractility is desired. Effects on the central nervous system are frequently regarded as undesirable in cardiac agents. Pharmacological studies indicate that the compounds of the invention do not have a substantial CNS, in particular dopaminergic, activity.In the compounds of the invention an alkyl group may be a straight alkyl group or a branched alkyl group having at least 3 carbon atoms. Symbols for numbers, atoms or groups referred to below have the broadest meaning previously assigned unless specified otherwise.Both organic and inorganic acids can be employed to form non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of this invention. Illustrative acids are sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, citric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, pamoic, ethanedisulfonic, sulfamic, succinic, cyclohexylsulfamic, fumaric, maleic, and benzoic acid. These salts are readily prepared by methods known in the art. The compounds of the invention contain an asymmetric carbon atom in the heterocyclic ring moiety. The thera peutic properties of the compounds may to a greater or lesser degree be ascribed to either or both of the two enantiomers occurring. Thus, the pure enantiomers as well as mixtures thereof are within the scope of the invention. The invention takes into consideration that compounds which structurally deviate from the formula I, after administration to a living organism may be transformed to a compound of the formula I and in this structural form exert their effects. This consideration is a further aspect of the invention. Methods of Preparation The compounds of the invention may be obtained by one of the following methods constituting a further aspect of the invention. a An ether or ester of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein Ra represents a hydrocarbon or acyl residue, preferably an alkyl group having 1 5 carbon atoms, or an alkylcarbonyl group having 2 6 carbon atoms, and.R is as defined above, may be cleaved to form a compound of formula I.When Ra is a hydrocarbon residue the cleavage may be carried out by treating the compound of formula II with an acidic nucleophilic reagent such as aqueous HBr, orHI, HBr CH3COOH, BBr3, AlCl3, pyridine HCl or CH3 3SiI, or with a basic nucleophilic reagent such as CH3C8H4 S or C2H5 S0. When Ra is an acyl residue the cleavage may be carried out by hydrolysis in an aqueous acid or base or by reduction, preferably by LiA1H4. The compound of formula II is obtainable by reacting a compound of formula IIA,EMI5.1 wherein Ra is an alkyl group, with X2 CH2 CH2C00C2H5 Xê Br,I orCH2 CH COOC2H5, in the presence of a base, to the formation of a compound of formula IIB. The compound IIB is then converted into a compound of formula IID along the following route. EMI6.1 Compound lIB is treated with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as Raney nickel to the obtention of compound IIC, in which a substituentmay be introduced at the nitrogen atom by means of a halide RX. If exchange of the group R is desired the ether function is then cleaved with BBr3 and the hydroxy group is acylated or realkylated in the presence of a base.The amide compound of the formula IID is converted into a compound of the formula II by reduction of the amide function and, if required, introduction of a group R in the manner described under c below. Thus the compound of formula IID may be treated with a reducing agent, preferably a hydride reducing agent such as LiAlH4 orBH3 in an etheral solvent or a metal reducing agent such as Na in an alcoholic solvent such as n butanol.The ethers or esters according to formula II may further be obtained by several processes analogous to the processes for preparation of the 3,5 di hydroxyphenol derivatives of formula I described below. b In a compound of the formulaEMI7.1 wherein Z represents SO3H, C1 or NH2, hydroxy groups may be substituted for the groups Z to the formation of a compound of formula I. When Z is SO3H or C1 said reaction may be carried out by treatment with a strong alkali under heating, suitably with an alkali melt such as KOH when Z is SO3H, and with a strong aqueous alkali such as NaOH or KOH when Z is C1. When Z is NH2 the reaction may be carried out by treatment with aqueous nitrous acid to the formation of an intermediate diazonium compound which is then subjected to hydrolysis in water. c A compound of the formulaEMI7.2 may be converted into a compound of formula I by alkylation of the nitrogen atom with an appropriate alkylating agent. Thus, the starting compound may be treated with an alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, or alkenyl halide or tosylate RX wherein X1 represents C1, Br, I orEMI8.1 in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile or acetone and in the presence of a base such as K2C03 or NaOH, or with an alcohol ROH in the presence of a catalyst, or the starting compound may be treated with a carboxylic acid NaBH4 complex RbCOOH NaBH4, wherein Rb is defined by the relation RbCH2 equals R.Further, the compound of formula IV may be reacted with an aldehyde of the formula RbCHO, wherein Rb is as just defined, and reduced to the formation of a compound of formula I. To the formation of a compound of formula I wherein R is CH3, which is not obtainable by the last mentioned reactions, the alkylation reaction may be carried out by treatment with a formaldehyde Na CN BH3 mixture.To the formation of a compound of formula I wherein R is hydroxylalkyl, the synthesis may also be carried out by alkylation with an appropriate dihaloalkane giving a monohaloalkyl derivative of I, followed by acid or alkaline hydrolysis,Especially, to the formation of a compound of formula I wherein R is 2 hydroxyalky5, the alkylation mey alos be carried out by reaction with a 1,2 epoxyalkane. d A carbonyl compound of the formulaEMI8.2 wherein M1 and M2 are the same or different and each represents CH2 or,CrO and the dashed lines represent bonds, one of which, when adjacent to a groupC 01 may be open and replaced by hydrogen atoms, and M3 isEMI9.1 when M1 and M2 are both CH2 , and in other cases M3 is R, R c is H, an alkyl or alkoxyl group containing 1 4 carbon atoms, a hydroxyalkyl group containing 1 5 carbon atoms, or an alkanyl group conteining 2 4 cerbon atoms, and Rd isH or R1CO, wherein R1 is an alkyl group having 1 5 carbon atoms, may be converted into a compound of the formula I by reduction of the amide or imide function, and tHe ester function RlCOO if present.Thus the compound of formula V may be treated with a reducing agent1 preferably a hydride reducing agent such as LiAlH4 or BH3 in an etheral solvent or a metal reducing agent such as Na in an alcoholic solvent such as n butanol when ring closure is not required. When one of the dashed lines in formula V represents an open bond, the reduction comprises ring closure in a compound of the formulaEMI9.2 and may be done by catalytic hydrogenation.e A compound of the formulaEMI9.3 wherein Re is H or benzyl and wherein Tri is an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group as further defined above, may be converted either by direct reduction or by first elimination of the tertiary alcohol to an intermediary l cycloalkenyl compound and then reduction into a compound of formula I, wherein R is as just defined. The reduction may preferably be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation with a catalyst such as Pd or PtO2, and the elimination reaction by heating in the presence of an acid.f An enamine of the formulaEMI10.1 wher ein Rf is defined by the relation Rf CH2CH2 equalsR, may be converted by reduction into a compound of formula I wherein R is an alkyl group with 2 5 carbon atoms. The reduction may preferably be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst such as Pd or PtO2. g A compound of the formulaEMI10.2 wherein yl is benzyloxy or OH, and R is an alkyl group containing 1 5 carbon atoms or a hydroxyalkyl group containing 2 6 carbon atoms and having the hydroxy group bound in a position other than the l position, may be converted by reduction into the corresponding compound of formula I. The reduction may preferably be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst such asPtO2, or by reduction with NaBH4 followed by catalytic hydrogenation.h A compound according to the formulaEMI11.1 wherein one of the groups ZÚ and Zê is a leaving groupX and the other is NHR, or zl and Z are both leaving groups X, and X is a leaving group such as C1, Br, I or OSO2C6H4CH3. may be converted to a compound of formula I by treating the compound of formula IX, or when one of l and This NH an acid addition salt thereof, with a base such as C2H5 3N or K2CO3, whereby the compound of formula IX is treated together with an equivalent amount of an amine R NH2 or an acid addition salt thereof when l and ê are both X.The conversion is carried out in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or acetonitrile, if necessary, with simultaneous or subsequent heating of the mixture.Free bases formed may subsequently be converted into their acid addition salts, and acid addition salts formed may subsequently be converted into the corresponding bases or other acid addition salts. The new compounds may, depending on the choice of starting materials and process, be obtained as enantiomers or mixtures thereof. The enantiomeric mixtures or racemates obtained can be separated according to known methods, e.g. by means of recrystallization from an optically active solvent, by means of microorganisms, or by a reaction with optically active acids forming salts of the compound and separating the salts thus obtained, e.g. by means of their different solubility, in the diastereomers, from which the antipodes by the influence of a suitable agent may be set free. Suitably useable optically active acids are e.g. the L and D forms of tartaric acid, di o tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphersulfonic acid or quinic acid. Preferably the more active part of the two antipodes is isolated.

The right atria and a papillary muscle from the right ventricle were isolated and set up to contract isometrically in an organ bath. The bath contained 50 ml Krebs buffer pH 7.4 and the temperature was kept at 32 C.The contractions were measured by means of a force displacement transducer Grass Model FTO3 coupled to a Grass Model 7 Polygraph with a preampliphier Grass Model 7PIF .The spontaneously beating right atria was stretched to a resting tension high enough to measure the contractions and to trigger a tachograph for registration of the frequency.The papillary muscle was stretched to the length at which maximal tension was developed and was driven at a frequency of 1 hz by a current 20 per cent above treshold and with a duration of 5 msec.After 60 min. equilibration, dose response curves to cumulative concentrations of isoprenaline were constructed for chronotropic effect, i.e. increase in frequency atria and positive inotropic effect, i.e. increase in contractility papillary muscle . After wash out similar curves were constructed for the compounds according to the invention.The positive inotropic agent dopamine was included for comparison.In order to establish the maximal chronotropic and inotropic responses of the preparations, isoprenaline was added immediately after the maximal concentrations of the compounds. The maximal effects of the compounds compared with the maximal effect of isoprenaline are expressed as intrinsic activity ISA . ResultsAs can be seen from Table I all the compounds tested produced an increase in contractility, i.e. displayed a positive inotropic effect in the isolated rabbit right papillary muscle. In contrast to dopamine, the compound of Example 1 had no positive chronotropic effect.The positive inotropic effect of the tested compounds of the invention are when the ISA values are compared somewhat lower than that obtained with dopamine. However, dopamine produced a marked positive chronotropic effect in doses which caused positive inotropy while isoprenaline caused marked positive chronotropy in doses significantly lower than those producing positive inotropy.
