# Process for stabilizing polyarylates with an aromatic phenol.

## Abstract
Described herein, is a process for preparing melt sta ble polyarylates having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.4 to greater than 1.0 dl g which comprises reacting a diester derivative of a dihydric phenoi with an aromatic dicarboxylic acid to produce a polyarylate having a re duced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl g, and then adding a stabilizing amount of an aromatic phenol to the polyarylate to form a polyarylate substantially free of anhydride linkages.
