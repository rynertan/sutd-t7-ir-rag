# Method of forming multilayer coated film.

## Abstract
A method of forming a multilayer coated film compris ing applying two or more nonaqueous layers to a continu ously traveling flexible web 3 , wherein at least one of the two or more coated layers comprises a coating composition containing an electron beam hardenable resin, and at least one of the two or more coated layers has a viscosity of about 100 cps or more, and irradiating 11 the two or more coated layers with electron beams to harden the coated layers or increase the viscosity thereof, and thereafter drying 12 the coated layers is disclosed.
