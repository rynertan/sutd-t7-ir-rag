# Apparatus for encoding image data.

## Abstract
An image signal encoding system wherein image signal is directly taken in for example from a video camera, changed to digital data, broken down into PDI basic patterns, and then converted into NAPLPS code automatically. The image signal is divided into a plurality of areas and the information content of the image signal is reduced for adequate encoding after taking in the image signal. Usually POLYGON commands are used as the NAPLAS code.
