# AN IMPROVED PNEUMATIC NOZZLE UTILIZED IN THE PROCESS OF PRODUCING A FASCIATED YARN

## Abstract
In a pneumatic nozzle utilized in the process of produc ing a fasciated yarn, provided with a transporting passage of a fiber bundle in which an inlet portion, a smaller channel, and a large channel having an outlet opening are successive ly arranged along the longitudinal axis of the transporting passage, and a plurality of air supply apertures for ejecting compressed air toward a restricted region of the transporting passage, a plurality of small chambers formed around the large channel is symmetry with respect to the large channel s longitudinal axis and connecting apertures for connecting the large channel to the outside of the nozzle so that air introduced into the large channel through the inlet opening and the air supply apertures can be partly discharged, while the remaining part of the above mentioned air is discharged from the outlet of the large chamber. In this nozzle, a supplemental ring can be used to adjust the air condition in the large chamber by mounting on a discharge end portion of the nozzle.
