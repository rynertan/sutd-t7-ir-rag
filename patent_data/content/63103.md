# A ring rolling mill.

## Abstract
A ring rolling mill comprising a driven working roll 4 a rotary mandrel 7 serving as a counter roll, and a contain ment roller 11 carried by a pivoted arm 10 and able to engage laterally the ring A being rolled, further includes a tracer roller 14 carried by a respective pivoted arm 13 . The assembly formed by the tracer roller 14 and its respective arm 13 is a mirror image of the assembly formed by the containment roller 11 and its respective arm 10 across the vertical plane identified by the axes of rotation of the working roll 4 and of the mandrel 7 , which are both vertically orientated. Means 21, 22 for detecting the angular position of the tracer arm 13 and of the containment arm 10 are connected to an electrical control circuit 32 of an hydraulic a servo valve 34 for regulation and locking of the angular movement of the containment arm 10 so as to maintain the containment roller 11 in a symmetrical position with respect to the tracer roller 14 across the vertical plane.
