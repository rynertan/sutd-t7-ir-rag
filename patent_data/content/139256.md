## Abstract
Coder decoder of television pictures for transmission and or reception via digital low speed channel. In transmis sion, it first carries out the bidimensional transform of digital sample blocks of the television signal and then a dichotomic quantization thus obtaining quantized coefficients with vari able length as a function of the coefficient index in reception, it first carries out a quantization for quantized coefficients re assignment of suitable quantization levels, and then the bidimensional antitransform for obtaining again the digital television signal samples.
