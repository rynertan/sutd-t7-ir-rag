# Preparation process of 2 chloropropionaldehyde.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for preparing 2 chloropropionaldehyde 2 CPA by using vinyl chloride, carbon monoxide and hydrogen as raw materials. Although processes making use of cobalt catalysts have conventional ly been known, it is disclosed herein that by using a rhodium compound and a nitrogen or phosphorus containing Lewis base in combination as a catalyst, the reaction is allowed to proceed at temperature and pressure lower than those required for such conventional processes and the selectivity toward the intended product is improved. It is also disclosed that by causing water to exist in the reaction system and using a water insoluble organic solvent, fractionating the reaction mixture into a water layer and an organic layer after the reaction and then collecting 2 CPA from the water layer through distillation, extraction or the like, the rhodium compound contained substantially in its entirety in an organic layer can be reutilized in the form of its solution. This process is an extremely good process suitable for use in the preparation of 2 CPA which is useful as an intermediate for chemical products, agricultural chemicals, pharmaceutical products, etc.
