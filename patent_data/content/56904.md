# High electron mobility single heterojunction semiconductor devices and methods of production of such devices.

## Abstract
A high electron mobility semiconductor device has a channel layer 7 and a source layer 8 . For example, the source layer 8 contains a sufficient amount of n type impurity to permit the accumulation of a quasi two dimensional electron gas 9 in proximity to a heterojunction 10 of the device formed between the layers 7 and 8 . p type impurity is selectively introduced into selected areas 12 of the source layer 8 . In relation to those selected areas 12 the availability of electrons in the source layer is decreased, so that the quasi two dimensional gas cannot accumulate in proximity to regions of the heterojunction 10 correspond ing to those areas 12 . Thereby, the selected areas 12 function as isolation areas. In general, by controlling impurity concentration and or impurity type in selected areas of the source layer 8 the appearance of the quasi two dimensional electron gas 9 can be inhibited or permitted selectively in correspondence with those areas.

## Description
HIGH ELECTRON MOBILITY SINGLE HETEROJUNCTION SEMI CONDUCTOR DEVICES AND METHODS OF PRODUCTION OF SUCH DEVICES This invention relates to high electron mobility semiconductor devices, and methods of production of such devices. The present invention is concerned with semiconductor devices which utilise electrons accumulated in the neighbourhood of a single heterojunction as a result of a difference between the electron affinities of the two different kinds of semiconductor between which the single heterojunction is formed. More specifically, the present invention relates to integrated circuits provided with an active semiconductor device or an FET of which the conduction medium is a group of free electrons which are accumulated in the neighbourhood of a single heterojunction, between a pair of layers, of respective different kinds of semiconductor, which have electron affinities different from one another, as a result of the difference in electron affinities of the semiconductors. Silicon Si has been the material most widely used for production of integrated circuits provided with FET s . Albeit that the switching speeds of FET s can be improved by decreasing the geometrical dimensions of theFET s, particularly by decreasing the distance between the source and drain of an FET, there is an inherent limitation of the degree of improvement which can be achieved, which limitation concerns the mobility of the electrons or holes in silicon. In order to overcome this limitation, various attempts have been made to utilise compound semiconductors. One of the attempts involves the utilisation of a group of free electrons accumulated in the neighbourhood of a single heterojunction between a pair of layers, of different kinds of semiconductor, having different electron affinities, due to a difference in electron affinities of the semiconductors.Such a group of free electrons hereinafter referred to as a quadratic electron gas, a quasi two dimensional electron gas exists in a region of an extremely small thickness , of for example several tens of Angstroms, and it suffers the effects of ionised impurity scattering to a lesser extent, thereby providing a considerable increase in electron mobility, particularly at cryogenic temperatures, at which the effects of ionised impurity scattering are the dominant factor limiting electron mobility This idea was reduced to practice by an invention concerning a high electron mobility single heterojunction active semiconductor device or a high electron mobility transistor. A high electron mobility transistor is provided with a single heterojunction between a pair of layers of different semiconductors. The different semiconductors are selected so that there is a substantial difference between their electron affinities. For example, GaAs andAlGaAs layers may be used. Further, the electron layer of lower electron affinity is preferably doped with an n type impurity. As a result of the difference in electron affinities, the semiconductor layer of the lower electron affinity is depleted of some quantity of electrons which move to the semiconductor layer having the higher electron affinity. As described earlier, the electrons accumulate in an extremely thin region close to the single heterojunction. These accumulated electrons , or the quasi two dimensional electron gas, provide a channel.The semiconductor layer having the lower electron affinity and the semiconductor layer having the higher electron affinity will be referred to respectively as an electron source layer and a channel layer. The electrons accumulated along the single heterojunction do not spread beyond the spread of electron wave the electrons do not spread blond a region of a thickness determined by the wave length of an electron wave function . In other words, the entire quantity of electrons is confined to an extremely thin region, of a thickness of only several tens ofAngstroms. This means that the electrons suffer the effects of ionised impurity scattering to a lesser extent.Therefore, the mobility of the electrons , or of the quadratic or two dimensional electron gas is greatly improved, particularly at cryogenic temperatures at which the effects of ionised impurity scattering are increased. On the other hand, the electron source layer is depleted to some extent. Therefore, if the thickness of the electron source layer is properly selected it is possible to make the electron source layer entirely isolated from a substrate. In such a case, the electrons accumulated along the single heterojunction, or the two dimensional electron gas, function or functions as the only channel for the layer configuration consisting of an electron source layer and a channel layer.Accordingly, when one or more insulatedlgates, or Schottky barrier gates, together with a source and drain pair are placed on the top surface of such a layer configuration, an FET can be provided whose conduction channel is limited to the channel formed by the electrons accumulated along the single heterojunction, that is, the quadratic electron gas. It will be noted that the thickness of an electron source layer may be required to be less than a specific thickness which is determined predominantly by the kinds of semiconductors employed and the temperature at which the device is used. Two different layer configurations are available for such a high electron mobility transistor. In one configuration a channel layer is grown on a substrate before an electron source layer is grown on the channel layer and before one or more gates, and a source and drain pair, are grown on the layer configuration. In the other configuration an electron source layer is grown on a substrate before a channel layer is grown on the electron source layer and one or more gates, and a source and drain pair, placed on the layer configuration. The former layer configuration allows a high electron mobility transistor to function either in a normally on mode depletion mode or in a normally off mode enhancement mode , depending upon whether or not the thickness of an electron source layer is larger than a specific thickness, which is determined predominantly by the kinds of semiconductors employed and the temperature at which the device is used. The latter layer configuration allows a high electron mobility transistor to function either in a normally on mode depletion mode or in a normally off mode enhancement mode depending upon whether or not the ratio of the thickness of the channel layer and the thickness of an electron source layer is larger than a specific value, which is determined predominantly by the kinds of semiconductors employed and the temperature at which the device is used. As alternatives to the use of GaAs and AlGaAs for layers of different electron affinities, layers ofGe and AlGaAs, or of Ge and GaAs, or of InSb and CdTe, or of InAs and GaSb , et al, can be used. A gate or gates can be fabricated either asSchottky barrier gate types or insulated gate types. In a case in which layers of GaAs and AlGaAs are used, electron mobilities have been determined to be 52 1.5 x 105cm2 VSec and 5 x 10 cm VSec respectively at 770K and 50K. As described above, a high electron mobility transistor can exhibit an extent electron mobility, thereby providing excellent high frequency performance and a high switching speed particularly at cryogenic temperatures. However, some problems still remain particularly in relation to the realistic production of an integrated circuit using high electron mobility transistors. The major problems remaining are 1 Isolation of respective high electron mobility transistors contained in an integrated circuit, 2 Mutual connection of high electron mobility transistors contained in an integrated circuit, and 3 Production of an integrated circuit provided with a plurality of high electron mobility transistors which have different characteristics Previously, the foregoing problems have been partly met by the application of one or more etching processes to selected areas, for the adjustment or revision of layer configuration for the ultimate purpose of regulating the electron sheet concentration of the twodimensional electron gas. There are, however, various drawbacks to such a procedure 1. Difficulty in making the integrated circuit in a planar configuration.2. Difficulty in precise oontrol of electron sheet concentration of the two dimensional electron gas. 3.The complicated nature of the etching processes involved.4. Cost disadvantages incurred because of the etching processes, and so on. According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a high electron mobility semiconductor device having first and second layers, of semiconductors having lesser and greater electron affinities respectively to provide a heterojunction 3nssthe device, wherein impurity concentration and dr impurity type in the first layer is selectively controlled, thereby to regulate the sheet concentration of electrons accumulated in proximity to the heterojunction in consequence of the different electron affinities of the first and second layers. According to the present invention there is also provided a high electron mobility semiconductor device manufactured in accordance with a method embodying the present invention. Embodiments of this invention can provide an integrated circuit having one or more high electron mobility transistors therein which are isolated from one another, and a method of production thereof. Embodiments of this invention can provide an integrated circuit having one or more high electron mobility transistors therein which are connected with one another, and a method of production thereof. Embodiments of this invention can provide an integrated circuit having a plurality of high electron mobility transistors therein, each of which has different characteristics. An integrated circuit embodying this invention can be provided with high electron mobility transistors which are separated from one another by an isolation area in which the occurrence of a two dimensional electron gas is inhibited. Such an isolation area is produced for example by introduction into a limited area corresponding to the isolation area of a p type impurity to compensate an n type impurity contained in an electron source layer, as a result reducing the quantity of free electrons contained in that limited area of the electron source layer.This decrease in the quantity of free electrons contained in the electron source layer is effective to exclude the two dimensional electron gas from the corresponding limited area, thereby providing an isolation area , whilst leaving the twodimensional electron gas in other areas in which the high electron mobility transistors are produced. Ion implantation processes, diffusion processes, or molecular beam epitaxy processes accompanied by ion beam doping may be employed for the foregoing introduction of a p type impurity to compensate for n type impurity contained in the electron source layer. An integrated circuit embodying this invention can be provided with high electron mobility transistors which are connected with one another by means of the twodimensional electron gas. The two dimensional, or quadratic, electron gas which acts as a conduction channel to connect high electron mobility transistors is produced, for example, by introduction of an n type impurity into a limited area of an electron source layer which originally contains a small amount of n type impurities, which limited area then corresponds to the above mentioned conduction channel. Due to the increase in the quantity of free electrons contained in the said limited area of the electron source layer, the twodimensional electron gas occurs exclusively in the area corresponding to the conduction channel for connecting high electron mobility transistors produced in one integrated circuit.Ion beam implantation processes, diffusion processes or molecular beam epitaxy processes accompanied by ion beam doping may be employed for the foregoing introduction of an n type impurity into a limited area of an electron source layer. An integrated circuit embodying this invention can be provided with a plurality of high electron mobility transistors some of which have a layer configuration allowing a two dimensional electron gas to occur to a greater or lesser extent and the others of which have a layer configuration which inhibits the occurrence of a two dimensional electron gas to a greater or lesser extent . The former layer configuration can be provided with a variety of two dimensional electron gas sheet electron concentrations, or a variety of pinch off voltages, on the assumption that a depletion mode FET is produced therefrom. The latter layer configuration can be provided with a variety of amounts of electrons contained in an electron source layer, or a variety of pinch off voltages, on the assumption that an enhancement mode FET is produced therefrom.The former layer configuration is produced either by introduction of, for example, a n type impurity into a limited area of an electron source layer which originally does not contain a sufficient amount of n type impurities to allow a two dimensional electron gas to occur, or by initially growing an electron source layer which contains a sufficient amount of n type impurities to allow a two dimensional electron gas to occur. The latter layer configuration is produced either by introduction of, for example, a p type impurity into a limited area of an electron source layer which originally contains a sufficient amount of n type impurities to allow a two dimensional electron gas to occur, or by initially growing an electron source layer which does not contain a sufficient amount of n type impurities to allow a two dimensional electron gas to occur.Ion implantation processes, diffusion processes or molecular beam epitaxy accompanied by ion beam doping may be employed for the foregoing introduction of n type or p type impurities into limited areas of an electron source layer. The aforementioned processes for introduction of impurities into a limited area of an electron source layer are effective for adjusting or altering the pinchoff voltage s of one or more of the high electron mobility transistors contained in an integrated circuit. Each of the foregoing embodiments, mentioned by way of example, can be modified to provide a case in which an original layer configuration is produced which allows an electron source layer to contain a medium amount of n type impurities, followed by introduction of n type or p type impurities respectively to specific areas of the source layer, to increase the amount of n type impurity or the amount of p type impurity in the corresponding specific areas, as a result allowing a two dimensional electron gas to occur in desired areas. The present invention makes use of the fact that the electron sheet concentration of a two dimensional electron gas can be regulated by means of the concentration of n type impurities contained in an electron source layer, which can in turn be regulated by introduction of n type impurity or p type impurity into the electron source layer which can be effected by diffusion performed at a relatively low temperature, molecular beam epitaxy accompanied by ion doping or ion implantation followed by heat treatment applied to the semiconductor layers at a low temperature which has no adverse effect on the crystal condition of the semiconductor layer. It will be noted that since introduced impurities are not required to reach the heterojunction, the introduction of ions into the electron source layer does not involve any of the adverse effects caused by ionised impurity scattering. Embodiments of the present invention can provide integrated circuits with active semiconductor devices orFET s the conduction medium of which is a group of free electrons accumulated in the neighbourhood of a single heterojunction between layers of semiconductors of different electron affinities.One or more selected regions of the semiconductor layer which has a higher electron affinity than the other semiconductor layer contains or contain a quantity of impurities for adjusting the sheet concentration of the foregoing group of free electrons after completion of the foregoing semiconductor layer configuration, thereby to allow production of 1 integrated circuits provided with active semiconductor devices or FET s of which the conduction medium is a group of free electrons and which are isolated from one another by a semiconductor layer configuration which prevents occurrence of the group of free electrons , 2 integrated circuits provided with active semiconductor devices or FET s which are connected with one another by means of the group of free electrons and 3 integrated circuits provided with a plurality of active semiconductor devices or FET s each of which has different characteristics.Embodiments of this invention provide methods for production of each of the foregoing kinds of integrated circuits. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a graph illustrating the hole concentration profile of an AlGaAs layer after Zn ions have been implanted therein, Figure 2 is a cross sectional view illustrating an AlGaAs and GaAs layer configuration of test pieces into which various amounts of Zn were implanted for the production of high electron mobility transistors having various pinch off voltages, Figure 3 is a graph illustrating the relationship between pinch off voltage and implanted Zn concentration, Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of a test piece in which mutual isolation of elements formed therein is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, Figure 5 is a cross sectional view of a test piece in which the interconnection of elements formed therein is provided in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of a wafer to be used in the production of an E D mode integrated circuit in accordance with an embodiment of this invention, at a stage in the production after completion of GaAs andAlGaAs layers, Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of the wafer of Figure 6 after completion of a process step for introduction of n type impurities into limited areas of an electron source layer thereof, Figure 8 is a cross sectional view of the wafer of Figure 6 after completion of a production step for the provision of sources and drains, and Figure 9 is a cross sectional view of the wave of Figure 6, after completion of the E D mode integrated circuit in accordance with an embodiment of this invention. The inventors have envisaged that introduction of impurities into an electron source layer of a layer configuration appropriate for production of a high electron mobility device or transistor is effective to regulate the electron sheet concentration of the quasi twodimensional electron gas which is accumulated in the neighbourhood of a single heterojunction between two semiconductor layers of the device. To put this into effect, the following requirements are met 1 abrupt doping of impurities into the electron source layer, and 2 a high magnitude activation ratio. The first requirement must be met, because the two dimensional, or quadratic, electron gas must remain free of the adverse effects of ionised impurity scattering.To meet this requirement, the projected range of the implanted impurities must be limited to approximately one third the thickness of the electron source layer. The second requirement must be met because a limited proportion of the total quantity of implanted impurities is activated so as to be allowed to act as a donor or an acceptor. In order to demonstrate the practicality of regulation of electron sheet concentration of a twodimensional electron gas by means of the introduction of impurities, experiments as described below were carried out. Representing an acceptor impurity, Zn ions were implanted into an undoped AlGaAs layer to a sheet 12 employing2 concentration of 4.5 x 1012 cm2, employing an ion implantation energy of 50 KeV. After a film of Si02 or some other material, had been grown on the top surface of the AlGaAs layer, to prevent As from being lost at high temperature, the AlGaAs layer was annealed for approximately 20 minutes at 700 C. The resultant profile of hole concentration in the AlGaAs layer is illustrated in the graph of Figure 1 which shows a projected range Rp of implantation of 230 Angstroms with a deviation BRp of 120 Apgstroms. The activation ratio the ratio of activated impurity sheet concentration Ns to implanted impurity concentration Nimp was determined to be approximately 0.8. The activation energy of holes was determined to be approximately 30 MeV, which is similar to the activation energy of Si implanted in an AlGaAs layer.Similar experiments were carried out for some donor impurities, e.g. Si, and similar results were obtained.The results of these experiments demonstrate the practicality of employing the above regulation mechanism. Following this, the inventors produced high electron mobility transistors each having a different pinch off voltage from the others starting from the same semiconductor layer configuration. A number of test pieces as illustrated in Figure 2 were produced employing molecular beam epitaxy. As illustrated in Figure 2, a buffer layer 2 of an undopedGaAs layer was grown on a Cr doped semi insulator GaAs substrate 1, before a channel layer 3, an undoped GaAs layer , was grown on the buffer layer 2. The channel layer 3 turns out to be n type doped with a concentration 15 due3 of 1015 cm3 due to indigenous impurities. An electron source layer 4, an AlGaAs layer, n type doped to a concentration of 1.5 x 1018 cm3, of a thickness of approximately 800 Angstroms, was grown on top of the channel layer 3. Si was employed as dopant.Since this layer configuration allows a two dimensional electron gas 5 to accumulate in the neighbourhood of a heterojunction 6 indicated in Figure 2, a high electron mcbility transistor produced of such a test piece functions as a normally on mode or depletion mode transistor. Ldetermined pinch off voltage was 1.0 V. Various amounts of Zn were implanted respectively into each of the test pieces. After a film of SiO2 or some other equivalent material was grown on each of the test pieces, the test pieces were annealed for 20 minutes at 0 700 C, to activate the implanted Zn. Thereafter, a source and drain pair not shown and a gate not shown were placed on each of the test pieces to produce high electron mobility transistors each having a pinch off voltage different from the others.The graph of Figure 3 illustrates the determined relationship between pinch off voltage and implanted Zn concentration. The pinch off voltage , which is 1.0 V for an plus as grown test piece, gradually shifts to a voltage with increase in the quantity of Zn implanted, to reach 0.5 V for a case in which the implanted Zn concentration is 7 x 10 12 cm2, crossing the 0 V point at an implantedZn concentration of 5 x 10 12 cm2 . The results of these experiments demonstrate that the pinch off voltage of a high electron mobility transistor can be regulated by the quantity of impurities introduced into the electron source layer. The present invention can be employed in practice for providing embodiments of the following three kinds. First, an integrated circuit having high electron mobility transistors which are isolated from one another , and a method of production thereof, can be provided. In other words , isolation between high electron mobility transistors produced in one integrated circuit can be provided, by means of an area in which the occurrence of a two dimensional electron gas is inhibited. Second, an integrated circuit having high electron mobility transistors which are connected with one another, and a method of production thereof, can be provided. In other words, connection between high electron mobility transistors produced in one integrated circuit can be provided, by means of a two dimensional electron gas. Third, an integrated circuit having a plurality of high electron mobility transistors of different pinch off voltages can be provided. With reference to Figure 4, an electron source layer 8, an n type Al GaAs layer, is grown on a channel layer 7, an undoped GaAs layer. This layer configuration is such as to satisfy the following inequality 1 , and thus a two dimensional electron gas 9 appears along a heterdjunction 10 shown in Figure 4, between the layers 7 and 8.EMI16.1 where, ND is the average concentration of n type impurities contained in the electron source layer 8, is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor 6f which the electron source layer is produced, t is the thickness of the electron source layer 8, q is the electric charge on an electron, VD1 is the neight of a barrier which appears, under thermal equilibrium, between the electron source layer 8 and a gate not shown which is to be placed on the electron source layer 8, K is Boltzmann s constant, Tis the temperature, in absolute temperature units, at which the high electron mobility transistor provided with the semiconductor layer mentioned above is to function. 9 The electron gasLis utilised for production of depletion mode high electron mobility transistors in areas designated 11 in Figure 4. Amounts of p type impurity ions are implanted into isolation areas 12 surrounding each of the high electron mobility transistors.After a film not shown of Six2, or of some other equivalent material, is grown on the electron source layer 8, the wafer is annealed for 20 minutes at 7000C for the purpose of activating the implanted impurity ions.The amount of acceptor impurity introduced in the isolation areas must be such that the above inequality 1 is not satisfied in those areas. This ion implantation process thus prevents the occurrence of the twodimensional electron gas, which is the only conduction channel for this device, in the area 12, thus providing the areas 12, which surround each high electron mobility transistor, with isolation properties. With reference to Figure 5, an electron source layer 13, an n type or i type AlGaAs layer , is grown on a channel layer, an undoped GaAs layer 12. This layer configuration is such as not to satisfy the above inequality 1 , so that no electron gas is available in the neighbourhood of the heterojunction 14. Enhancement mode high electron mobility transistors are produced in areas designated 15. Amounts of n type impurity ions are implanted into areas 16, by which high electron mobility transistors are to be connected with one another. After a film not shown of SiO2, or of some other equivalent material, is grown on the electron source layer 13, the wafer or test piece is annealed for 20 minutes at 700 0C to activate the implanted impurity ions.The amount of donor impurity introduced must be sufficient to allow the above inequality 1 to be satisfied. This ion implantation process allows a quasi two dimensional electron gas to appear, to provide mutual connection among enhancement mode high electron mobility transistors which are produced in the areas designated 15. It is of course possible to produce wirings on the top surface of an integrated circuit. Combination of ordinary wrings of this type and connections in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention allows a considerable degree of freedom in the provision of connections amongst component elements or high electron mobility transistors produced in an integrated circuit. With reference to Figures 6 to 9, a process for the production of an E D Enhancement Depletion mode integrated circuit having a plurality of high electron mobility transistors each having a pinch off voltage differ ent from the others, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention,will be described. Referring toFigure 6, a buffer layer 18, an undoped GaAs layer, is grown on a Cr doped semi insulator GaAs substrate 17, before a channel layer 19, an undoped GaAs layer, is grown on the buffer layer 18. An electron source layer 20, an n typeAlGaAs layer, is grown on top of the channel layer 19.The thickness of the electron source layer and the concent notion of n type impurity therein are selected so that the inequality 1 is not satisfied. Therefore, a two dimensional electron gas is not allowed to appear along a heterojunction 21. Referring to Figure 7, a photoresist film 22 is produced to cover the top surface of the electron source layer 20, except in areas such as 23 in which depletion mode high electron mobility transistors are to be produced. An ion implantation process is employed to introduce an n type impurity , e.g. Si in such areas.It is important to select the ion implantation energy to limit the thickness of an n type region 24 formed as a consequence of such implantation to less than the thickness of the electron source layer 20. The amount of n type impurity implanted must be such that in areas where it is implanted the inequality 1 is satisfied. The photoresist film 22 is removed in its entirety and a film not shown of SiO2, or some other equivalent material, is grown on top of the electron source layer 20, before the wafer is annealed for 20 minutes at 700 0C to activate the implanted impurity ions. Since the quantity of electrons has been increased in areas such as 23, to satisfy inequality 1 , a two dimensional electron gas 25 appears exclusively in areas 24 in which depletion mode high electron mobility transistors are to be produced. Referring to Figure 8, an Au.Ge alloy film 26 is produced on the top surface of the electron source layer 20, and then patterned to the shape of sources and drains.An annealing process is employed to form ohmic contact regions 27 which connect the sources and drains 26 and the quasi two dimensional electron gas 25 and the heterojunction 21 in areas 28 in which enhancement mode high electron mobility transistors are to be produced. Referring to Figure 9 , an evaporation process is employed for production of an Al film 29 on the top surface of the wafer, and then the Al film 29 is patterned to the shape of a gate. As a result, an E D mode integrated circuit is provided with depletion mode high electron mobility transistors produced in areas such as area 23, and enhancement mode high electron mobility transistors produced in areas28. In view of the usefulness of E D mode integrated circuits, for the production of high speed logic circuits, this embodiment is of outstanding value particularly from the industrial viewpoint. Needless to say, the foregoing three kinds of embodiment of the present invention can be combined with one another in one integrated circuit. Embodiments of the present invention provide semiconductor devices utilising electrons which are accumulated in the neighbourhood of a single heterojunction as a result of a difference in electron affinities of two different semiconductors which provide the single heterojunction therebetween, and methods for the production thereof, in which one or more processes for the introduction of impurities is or are employed for the purpose of regulating the electron sheet concentration of the aforementioned electrons.Thus there can be provided 1 an integrated circuit having one or more high electron mobility transistors which are isolated from one another by an area in which the aforementioned electrons are not allowed to accumulate, 2 an integrated circuit having one or more high electron mobility transistors some of the input and output terminals of which are connected with one another by the aforementioned electrons, accumulated due to a difference in electron affinities, and 3 an integrated circuit having a plurality of high electron mobility transistors having different pinch off voltages, particularly including E D mode transistors. These three attributes can be provided in combination for example in one IC device. The present invention can provide an active semiconductor device with high electron mobility comprising a first layer of an undoped semiconductor produced on a semi insulating semiconductor substrate, a second layer of a semiconductor having a less amount of electron affinity than the semiconductor of said first layer and which is produced on said first layer, said second layer having introduced with an impurity for the immediate purpose to regulate the quantity of electrons contained in said second layer and for the ultimate purpose to regulate the sheet concentration of electrons accumulated along the heterojunction between said first layer and said second layer due to the difference in the amounts of electron affinity, at least one control terminal placed on said second layer, and a pair of an input terminal and an output terminal placed across said at least one control terminal, on said second layer. The present invention can further provide a method for production of an active semiconductor device with high electron mobility comprising a step to grow a first layer of an undoped semi conductor on a semi insulating semiconductor substrate, a step to grow a second layer of a semiconductor having a less amount of electron affinity than the semiconductor of said first layer on said first layer, a step to introduce an impurity to said second layer for the immediate purpose to regulate the quantity of electrons contained in said second layer and for the ultimate purpose to regulate the sheet concentration of electrons accumulated along the heterojunction between said first layer and said second layer due to the difference in the amounts of electron affinity , before activating the same by annealing, a step to produce a pair of an input terminal and an output terminal on the top surface of said second layer, and a a step to produce at least one control terminal on the area between said pair of an input terminal and an output terminal on the top surface of said second layer. The present invention can provide an integrated circuit comprising a first layer of an undoped semiconductor produced on a semi insulating semiconductor substrate, a second layer of a semiconductor having a less amount of electron affinity than the semiconductor of said first layer and which is produced on said first layer, at least one high electron mobility transistor comprising said first layer, said second layer, at least one control terminal placed on said second layer, at least one pair of an input terminal and an output terminal placed across the corresponding one of said at least one control terminal, on said second layer, and at least one isolation area in which no electrons are accumulated along the heterojunction between said first layer and said second layer due to the difference in the amounts of electron affinity and which is produced insaid second layer to surround each of said at least one high electron mobility transistor.
