# Temperature compensator for pressure regulator.

## Abstract
A temperature compensator 10 mounted on a gas pressure regulator 12 having a spring loaded valve in which the amount of compression in the spring 86 is changed by moving an adjusting member of the compensator in re sponse to changes in temperature. The temperature com pensator 10 may include a piston and cylinder assembly 60 containing a fluid which contracts in response to a reduction in temperature and expands in response to an increase in temperature. The piston 68 is in engagement with the spring 86 and is moved to change the amount of compression in the spring in response to the change in temperature.
