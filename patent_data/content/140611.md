# Thermal ink jet printhead assemblies.

## Abstract
A passivation layer 10, 12, 12 in a thermal ink jet printhead is formed or grown by a reaction between the materials of the ink jet structure to be protected and an element which will form a chemically inert, electrically in sulating, thermally conductive compound. The resistor structure 6 may be of tantalum or tantalum nitride and the electrical conductors 6 therefor may be of aluminum. By subjecting this resistor conductor structure to a reactive oxide atmosphere, the exposed surfaces of both are anodized so that a surface film of aluminium oxide is formed on the aluminium conductor and a surface film of tantalum pentoxide or tantalum oxynitride is formed on the resistor structure.
