# Multi laser mount.

## Abstract
A multi laser assembly 15 includes a support block 22 with a plurality of circular cylinder bores 19 , each receiving optical elements 30 . Juxtaposed along the length of each of the bores in a circumferentially spaced apart relation is a pair of positioning rods 31, 32, 33 having surfaces extending into the bore. The surfaces are precisely aligned with a desired optical axis 19 to be established by the optical element 30 . A plunger 34 pushes the optical element against the rods to establish the optical axis. Lasers 20 and adjustment apparatus 26, 27, 37 are in cluded in the assembly.
