# The preparation of polyurethanes using monocarboxylic acid salts of bis aminoethyl ether derivatives as catalysts.

## Abstract
Certain salts of bis aminoethyl ether derivatives show unexpectedly high efficiency as catalysts for polyurethane formation. Smaller amounts of these catalysts are employed to produce foams of the same reaction profile, when compared with known amine salt catalysts. The catalysts are monocarboxylic acid salts of amines of the formula
