# Wire sheath in motor vehicle doors.

## Abstract
A tubular flexible wire sheath assembled in the motor vehicle doors is snapped through a groove 11 obtained around its hollow head 12 and presents an external side surface which is corrugated for three quarters 14 and smooth for the remaining quarter 15 .

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. Tubular flexible wire sheath assembled in motor vehicle doors of the type fixed at one end 10 to the motor vehicle body 7 and which is slidable inside a plate with a hole 5 fixed on the door 1 characterized in that the sheath is corrugated all over its length on three quarters 14 of its external side surface. 2. Tubular flexible sheath as per claim 1 characterized in that the remaining quarter 15 of its external side surface is completely smooth. 3. Tubular flexible sheath as per claims 1 to 2 characterized in that the neutral axis of curvature runs on the smooth side surface 15 . 4. Tubular flexible sheath as per claims 1 to 3 characterized in that the part attached to the motor vehicle body presents a hollow head 12 comprising a circular groove 11 enabling the sheath to be snapped into a hole of the motor vehicle body. 5. Tubular flexible sheath as per claims 1 to 4 characterized in that it is obtained by a blowing process.

## Description
Wire sheath in motor vehicle doors This invention relates to a sheath for protection of the wires crossing the motor vehicle doors and controlling the various accessories placed in the doors.This type of sheath is traditionally made of elastomeric material and has a wide section in order to house the various control wires which are in great number specially in luxury motor vehicles e g. for actuating the window operating mechanism, the rearview mirror or the loudspeaker.Said sheaths generally present a wide tubular section and are generally made of rubber of considerable thickness and of smooth surface and therefore they present some inconveniences , e.g. a sheath deformation when opening or closing the doors and consequently a dangerous wearing causing the kinking of the wires housed inside the sheath.Furthermore, for the stability of the assembled part, a plate and a counterplate, both with a hole, are provided in the flange joined to the motor vehicle body to allow the passage of the usual blocking means. Furthermore the number and the overall dimensions of the components involve high costs and long assembly and working times. The primary object of the invention is to avoid said inconveniences, providing a sheath as above mentioned which guarantees a good operative flexibility and a quick and stable assembly into the motor vehicle body without screws or similar securing means.Further object of this invention is to provide a product of easy manufacture, of reduced weight and size at competitive costs.These objects are achieved according to the present invention by providing a tubular flexible wire sheath assembled in motor vehicle doors of the type fixed at one end 10 to the motor vehicle body 7 and which is slidable inside a plate with a hole 5 fixed on the door 1 characterized in that the sheath is corrugated all over its length on three quarters 14 of its external side surface.The foregoing and further features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more particular description, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 is a schematic partial front section of the door and of the corresponding part of the motor vehicle body housing the sheath object of this invention.Fig. 2 is a frontal view of the sheath andFig. 3 is a sectional view taken along in the line 111 111 of Fig. 2.Referring to Fig. 1 to 3 the numeral 1 schematically designates a motor vehicle door rotating about the axis 2 and provided with an inner wall 3 and with a hole 4 for housing the plate 5.Numeral 6 designates a part of the motor vehicle body corresponding to door 1 having an inner wall 7 and a hole 8 axially corresponding to the above mentioned hole 4 of the door 1, when the door is closed. Into the hole 8 of the motor vehicle body is snapped the sheath in synthetic material, e.g. polyethylene, and shown with numeral 10.This sheath snapping is possible both for the material flexibility and for the circular groove 11 obtained around its hollow head 12.This hollow head 12 is continuously connected to the tubular member 13 passing through the hole 4 of the door 1. Said tubular member 13 has a reduced thickness and an external side surface 14 presenting a nearly circular section.The tubular member is corrugated for three quarters of its circumference while the remaining quarter is smooth and contains the neutral axis of curvature of the sheath Fig. 3 , It is evident from the above description that the electric control wires not illustrated passing through the sheath 10 are not kinked when opening the door 1, as shown in the opening position la dotted line .The above mentioned advantages are due to the corrugation 14 which allows a good flexibility also in the curved position 10a avoiding bending, sharp kinking, etc. To these advantages it is also to add the presence of a smooth part 15 on which runs the neutral axis when the door is completely opened. This facilitates the sliding of the sheath and avoids any noise when opening or closing the motor vehicle door.Another advantage of the sheath object of the present invention is that, being made of synthetic material, it can be manufactured by a blowing process, at reduced costs compared to the injection mouldingNaturally the foregoing description has been given in detail for ease of understanding the inventive teaching and principles involved, which latter may be incorporated in other physical embodiments without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
