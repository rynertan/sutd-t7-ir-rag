## Description
This invention relates to an AM receiver compri sing a tuning oscillator, a first phase detector and a first loop filter successively arranged in a first phase control loop, said tuning oscillator being syn chronized with a reference oscillator coupled to the first phase detector and applying a mixing frequency to a mixer stage for conversion of a received AM signal into an IF AM signal, said mixer stage being coupled to an AM demodulator for demodulation of the base band modu lation signal. An AM receiver of this type is known from the article Frequenzsynthesizer in Grundig Rundfunkgeräten der Spitzenklasse by R. Lehmann, published in Grundig Technische Informationen , no. 1 2, 1980, pages 8 15. In the known AM receiver the first phase control loop is used for frequency synthesis tuning. In this first phase control loop the mixing frequency is to this end divided in a programmable divider by a dividing factor which is adjustable to discrete values and subse quently compared in the first phase detector with a reference frequency originating from the reference oscil lator. The phase difference between the signals applied to the first phase detector is applied to the tuning oscillator after selection in the first loop filter so that the mixing frequency corresponds to a given number of times the reference frequency determined by said divi ding factor. Tuning is stabilized by making use of a crystal oscillator as a reference oscillator and is varied by varying the dividing factor of the said divider. When a synchronous AM demodulator is used for demodulation of the IF AM signal as is known, for examp le, from United States Patent Specification no. 3,603,890 a second phase control loop is generally used for genera ting a local detection carrier synchronized with the IF carrier. An AM receiver using both frequency synthesis tuning and synchronous AM detection therefore includes two phase control loops requiring, as is hitherto known, two voltage controlled oscillators and one reference oscillator. To realize an acceptable dynamic range in an AM receiver of this type, comparatively expensive means are required for example, to limit the pull in effect of powerful neighbouring transmitters in the case of weak signal reception, the IF filter preceding the second phase control loop should be highly selective, the band width of and the gain in this loop should be fairly narrow and large, respectively, and the voltage controlled os cillator therein should be fairly stable. However, these steps may cause unwanted side effects on the tuning be haviour such as, for example, critical tuning. Moreover, the loop gain, the bandwidth and the stability of the second phase control loop are dependent on the amplitude of the IF signal and hence on the amplitude of the received signal. A limiter circuit preceding the second phase de tector may reduce this dependence. However, such a limiter circuit should not be used, because in the case of the reception of weak transmitters in the neigbourhood of powerful transmitters it limits the more powerful neigh bouring transmitter signal at the expense of the weaker desired signal and hence drastically reduces the dynamic range. It is an object of the invention to provide an AM receiver using frequency synthesis tuning and synchro nous AM detection, which reciever has an acceptable dyna mic range and can be realized with low cost components and with fewer oscillators than mentioned hereinbefore. According to the invention an AM receiver of the type described in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the reference oscillator is controllable and is disposed between a second loop filter and a second phase detector of a second phase control loop coupled to the mixer stage for applying a local detection carrier syn chronized with the IF AM signal carrier to the AM demodu lator, said second loop filter applying a control signal to the reference oscillator and being connected through a coupling circuit to a control input of the tuning oscil lator for negative feedback of the control signal of the reference oscillator to the tuning oscillator. In prior German Patent Application No. 33 35 024 the Applicant has described the possibility of providing a controllable reference oscillator in an FM receiver using frequency synthesis tuning and to use it as a voltage controlled oscillator in a phase control loop synchronized by a pilot signal in the base band modulation signal. Since such a pilot signal in the transmitter is derived from a stable crystal frequency, the reference frequency synchronized in the receiver with this pilot signal is also stable and is not directly dependent on phase and or frequency disturbances of the IF signal, which are caused, for example, by disturbances in the mixing frequency or by reception of powerful neighbouring transmitters. When the second phase control loop is synchro nized with the IF carrier, this is, however, indeed the case a closed loop in which disturbances may be positively fed back and thus give rise to instability is produced through the coupling between the mixer stage and the second phase detector and the coupling between the reference os cillator and the first phase detector. Such instability particularly occurs when weak signals are received, giving rise to an intermediate frequency signal disturbed in pha se and or frequency by noise, intermodulation and or neigh bouring reception and greatly reduces the dynamic range. The invention is based on the recognition that the coupling between the two phase control loops through the reference oscillator and the first phase detector pro vides an extra control possibility for the tuning oscil lator from the first loop filter, which control only acts on the phase of the mixing frequency. A dynamic negative interference feedback which stabilizes the aforementioned closed loop and hence considerably increases the dynamic range of the AM receiver can be realized through this extra phase control. When using the step according to the invention, this extra phase control is obtained by a negative feed back of the control signal for the reference oscillator through the coupling circuit to the tuning oscillator. As a result disturbances which are positively fed back to the tuning oscillator from the reference oscillator through the first phase detector and the first loop filter are compensated by the disturbances in the control signal for the reference oscillator. Consequently, the reference oscillator can on the one hand be used as a reference fre quency source for the first phase control loop, for examp le, for frequency synthesis tuning, and on the other hand as a frequency generator for generating a local detection carrier for the purpose of synchronous AM detection in the AM demodulator without reducing the stability and hence the dynamic range of the receiver. With appropriate choice of the amplification factor of the coupling circuit, the dynamic negative interference feedback obtained through the coupling cir cuit has the additional advantage that comparatively large phase disturbances of the IF signal, which in conventional AM receivers give rise to instabilities in a second phase control loop merely serving, for example, as a generator circuit for a local detection carrier, do not or substan tially not disturb the stability so that a comparatively weakly selective and hence low cost IF filter may suffice. The dynamic range is further increased by preven ting poles from occurring in the right half plane in the root locus diagram of the transfer function from the input of the mixer stage to the output of the reference oscillator. To this end a preferred embodiment of the AM receiver accor ding to the invention is characterized in that the coup ling circuit includes a frequency dependent compensation circuit whose transfer function has a pole at the lowest frequency, at which also a pole occurs in the transfer function of the first loop filter. This step additionally has the advantage that by suitable choice of the other parameters of the compensation circuit the bandwidth of the total loop circuit is adjust able to a desired value of several Hz for example, 3 Hz so that powerful neighbouring transmitters cannot or substantially not disturb the phase coupling with the desired received carrier and hence the tuning. An AM receiver of this type can be realized in a simple manner in a further preferred embodiment which is characterized in that the frequency dependent compen sation circuit includes a differentiating integrating net work. In a still further preferred embodiment the coup ling circuit includes an inverter circuit for inverting the signal applied to the tuning oscillator. A simple combination of the functions of the inverter and compensation circuits is preferably obtained by means of an operational amplifier whose inverting input is coupled to the second loop filter, a non inverting input is connected to ground and an output is coupled at one end to the inverting input througha resistor bridged series RC member and at the other end to the control input of the tuning oscillator. The invention will be described in greater detail with reference to the figures shown by way of example in the drawings. In this drawings Figure 1 shows an AM receiver provided with an aerial input I having successively coupled to it an RF input part RF, a mixer stage M, an IF part IF, a synchronous AM detector SD, an audio signal processing part A and a loudspeaker device L. Signal processing in these circuits briefly is effected as follows the long and medium wave AM radio range from 150 kHz to 1.6 MHz is applied broad banded through the RF input part RF to the mixer stage M and up converted in the mixer stage M to a high intermediate frequency of preferably at least three times the highest frequency of the received fre quency band, for example, 8 MHz. The AM IF signal at the output of the mixer stage M is selected in the IF part IF and synchronously detected with the aid of the syn chronous AM detector SD. The base band modulation signal thus obtained is processed in the audio signal processing part A and reproduced by the loudspeaker device L. The AM receiver also includes a first phase con trol loop PLL1 functioning as a frequency synthesizer circuit and a second phase control loop PLL2 functioning as an IF carrier generator circuit. The first phase con trol loop PLL1 is provided with a tuning oscillator TO which has one end coupled to the mixer stage M and applies a mixing frequency to it for the aforementioned frequency conversion, and has the other end coupled through a frequency divider FDN to a first phase detector PD1. In this first phase detector PD1 the mixing frequency divided in the frequency divider FDN by a dividing factor N is compared with a reference frequency to be described hereinafter. The result of the comparison is applied through a first loop filter LP1 as a first control signal to a control input of the tuning oscillator TO so that the mixing frequency is in phase synchronism with the said reference frequency. The second phase control loop PLL2 is provided with a voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO func tioning as a reference oscillator whose frequency is coupled in phase through a second phase detector PD2 with the carrier of the IF AM signal. To this end a first input of the second phase detector PD2 is coupled to the IF part IF, a second input is coupled to a quadrature output 90 270 of the crystal oscillator VCXO and an output is coupled through a second loop filter LP2 to a control input of the crystal oscillator VCXO. An in phase output 0 180 of the crystal oscillator VCXO is coupled to a carrier input of the synchronous AM detector SD and applies the local IF detection carrier thereto which is in phase with the carrier of the IF AM signal for said detection of the modulation signal. According to the invention the first and second phase control loops PLL1 and PLL2 are mutually coupled both for frequency and control current the coupling for frequency is brought about because the crystal oscillator VCXO is connected through a frequency divider FDM in which the reference frequency is divided by a dividing factor M to the first phase detector PD1, whilst the coupling for control current is brought about because the second loop filter LP2 is connected through a coupling circuit C to the control input of the tuning oscillator TO. In the embodiment shown the coupling circuit C in cludes a cascade arrangement of an inverting amplifier circuit AI and a frequency dependent compensation circuit CC. The output signal from the coupling circuit C at the control input of the tuning oscillator TO is added to that of the first loop filter LP1, whilst the sign of the tuning slope of the reference and tuning oscillators that is to say, the direction in which the oscillator frequency varies with a variation of the control voltage is mutually equal. It stands to reason that such a nega tive feedback of the control signal from the reference oscillator to the tuning oscillator is also possible without signal inversion, that is to say, with a non inverting amplifier, for example, by subtracting the output signal of the coupling circuit C at the control input of the tuning oscillator TO from that of the first loop filter LP1 or by using a reference oscillator and a tuning oscil lator whose tuning slopes have opposite signs. Furthermore it is to be noted that the inventive idea can also be used when the frequency dependent compensation circuit CC is omitted, as will be described hereinafter. On the one hand the coupling for frequency pre vents an unwanted variation of the mixing frequency being introduced through the coupling for control current, so that an extra phase correction in tuning is realized through the coupling for control current. On the other hand the coupling for frequency leads to a saving in the number of voltage controlled oscillators normally re quired in conventional AM receivers, because the voltage controlled oscillator VCXO supplies both the local in phase IF detection carrier for the synchronous AM detec tor SD and the reference frequency for the first phase control loop PLL1. It stands to reason that the inter mediate frequency consequently corresponds to a number of times the reference frequency determined by the dividing factors M and N. Besides, the use of a crystal oscillator as a voltage controlled oscillator VCXO in the second phase control loop PLL2 reduces the requirements relative to the IF selectivity, thus leading to a further reduction in costs. Particularly when weak signals are received, a low cost, comparatively weakly selective IF filter in the IF part IF results in a strong influence of neighbouring transmitter signals on the input level of the second phase control loop PLL2. Neighbouring levels, which are 50 dB higher than the desired signal level, are no excep tion. Due to the comparatively large stability of the voltage controlled crystal oscillator VCXO, a phase syn chronization on the comparatively small carrier of the desired IF signal is still possible under such circumstan ces. The said negative feedback of the control signal of the reference oscillator VCXO to the tuning oscillator TO through the coupling circuit C for control current provides an improvement in stability, because positive interference feedback through the coupling frequency which may arise as a result of unwanted phase shifts in the loop circuits are compensated to a certain extent. However, the frequency dependent compensation circuit CC of the coupling circuit C in the coupling for control current realizes a further optimisation of the stability, which will be described with reference to Figures 2, 3A and 3B. Figure 2 shows for small phase variations the theoretical phase transfer diagram of the interconnected first and second phase control loops PLL1 and PLL2 of the tunes AM receiver of Figure 1. The mixer stage M and the second phase detector PD2 are shown in this Figure in their function of difference producers for the phase va riations occuring at their inputs, the phase transfer function of the second loop filter LP2 is denoted by H2, the voltage phase transfer function of the voltage con trolled oscillator VCXO with one pole in its origin is denoted by 1 p and the phase transfer function of the first phase control loop PLL1 from the input of the fre quency divider circuit FDM to the output of the tuning oscillator TO is denoted by H1. The transformed phase transfer function of the coupling circuit C from the output of the second loop filter LP2 to the output of the tuning oscillator TO is denoted by H If the phase of the carrier of the AM reception signal is denoted Ø When using a conventional filter as a second loop filter LP2 with two poles at 517 Hz and 0 Hz, respective ly, and one zero at 50 Hz, the transfer function H₂ may be written as To obtain a stable transfer, at least for a dynamic range of 50 dB, a current control coupling is provided according to the invention whose transformed phase transfer function already referred to hereinbefore is denoted by H When appropriately choosing the transformed trans fer function H The stabilisation is optimized when all zeros of the transfer cuntion 4 are located in the left half plane of the complex p plane, which is generally achieved when the transfer function of the coupling circuit C, i.e. the frequency dependent compensation circuit CC, has a pole at or near the lowest frequency at which a pole also occurs in the first loop filter LP1. Starting from the aforemen tioned choice of transfer functions this can be realized in a simple manner by using an inverting proportionally integrating and differentiating network as a compensation circuit having a transfer function H In a practical embodiment of an AM receiver accor ding to the invention double balanced ring mixers Mini Circuits ZAD were used for the mixer stage M and the second phase detector PD2, and an integrated frequency syn thesiser circuit of the type Philips SAA 1057 was used for the first phase control loop PLL1. The bandwidth of the second phase control loop was 3.5 Hz, which is sufficient ly narrow to adequately suppress neighbouring signals at a distance of 9 KHz from, and at an amplitude which is 50 dB larger than the desired AM reception signal. Figure 4A shows the response at the input of the voltage controlled oscillator VCXO in the case of a frequency variation in steps of 10 Hz at the input of the mixer stage M at a mixing or tuning frequency of 1.6 MHz and a maximum input signal level. Figure 4B shows a similar response at an input signal level which is 50 dB lower. In that case only slight and acceptable overshoot occurs. Comparable phe nomena occur at different tuning frequencies within the aforementioned tuning range of the AM receiver. Figure 4C shows the response at the input of the voltage controlled oscillator VCXO for a frequency variation in steps of 63 Hz at the input of the mixer stage M at a maximum input signal level, and Figure 4D shows the response for an input signal level, which is 60 dB lower. It is obvious that in the latter case, thus at lower input signal levels and comparatively large frequency variations, the acquisition period of the coupled loops may last some periods of the AM carrier frequency longer than in the preceding cases in practice this is, however, hardly noticeable. Figure 5 shows a practical embodiment of a coupling circuit satisfying the aforementioned transfer function H The coupling circuit C includes an operational amplifier OA whose inverting input is connected through an input resistor to the output of the second loop filter LP2 not shown , a non inverting input being connected to ground and an output having one end fed back via an RC network R₁, R₂, C₁ to the inverting input and the other end being connected to the control input of the tuning oscillator TO not shown . The RC network R₁, R₂, C₁ is constituted by a series RC member R₁C₁ bridged by a resistor R₂. In this circuit the functions of the aforementioned inverter circuit or inverting amplifier AI and the frequency dependent compensation circuit are com bined. If signal inversion is not necessary, the inverting input of the operational amplifier OA is to be connected to ground through the input resistor, and the non inverting input is to be connected to the output of the second loop filter LP2 not shown .
