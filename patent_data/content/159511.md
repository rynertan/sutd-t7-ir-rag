# Aluminum iron vanadium alloys having high strength at elevated temperatures.

## Abstract
The invention provides an aluminum based alloy con taining essentially, in weight percentage Fe 7 to 15 V 2 to 10 one or more of the following elements Zn, Co, Ni, Cr, Mo, Zr, Ti, Hf, Y, Ce 0 to 2 balance Al The alloy has a distinctive microstructure which is at least about 50 composed of a generally spherical, inter metallic O phase. Particles composed of the alloys of the invention can be heated in a vacuum and compacted to form a consolidated metal article have high strength and good ductility at both room temperature and at elevated temperatures of about 350 C. The consolidated article is composed of an alumi num solid solution phase containing a substantially uniform distribution of dispersed intermetallic phase precipitates therein. These precipitates are fine intermetallics mea suring from about 10 nm to about 100 nm in diameter with an average interparticle spacing ranging from 50 500 nm.
