# Expanded perlite alkali metal silicate insulation material and a process for the production thereof.

## Abstract
A coherent, rigid, heat stable, low density, low thermal conducticity, strong, impact resistant, water repellent ther mal insulation material, having an average maximum linear shrinkage of 2 or less at temperatures up to 649 C 1200 F , made from expanded perlite, alkali metal silicate solution, kaolin clay, and organic fiber. Additions of methylcellulose and polydimethyl silicone liquid enhance the insulation material s strength and water repellency characteristics. The material may be cured and dried at a temperature of about 76.7 C 170 F or less for a period of about 24 hours or more without humidity control.
