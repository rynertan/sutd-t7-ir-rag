# Vertical spindle machine tool with tiltable spindle and tiltable automatic tool changer.

## Abstract
The spindle head 72 of a gantry type vertical spindle machining center 10 is slidably mounted on a spindle base 46 which is pivotally mounted on the saddle 36 for rocking movement about a horizontal axis 56 to cause the axis of the spindle to tilt from the vertical. A tool storage magazine 82 is mounted on the spindle base 46 and is tiltable along with the spindle to enable toolholders 78 to be transferred between the spindle and tool storage magazine 82 at any spindle tilt angle. A tool changer arm 86 is mounted on the tool storage magazine 82 for transferring tools between the spindle and the tool storage magazine 82 .
