# Semiconductor package substrate and manufacturing process.

## Abstract
A multilayer ceramic substrate 20 has on its surface contact pads formed in indentations 24 which are inters persed between the matrix of vias and connected by indented lines to vias 26 at the periphery of the matrix. The indentations and the pattern of indented lines 40 are formed in the surface of a green ceramic substrate, the lines filled with a conductive metal paste, and a layer 50 of dielectric green ceramic material deposited over at least a portion of the area of the pattern of indented lines. The resultant substrate is then sintered.
