# Heat sterilizable storage solution for red blood cells and blood bags containing it.

## Abstract
Aqueous storage solution for red blood cells comprising a stabilized ascorbate derivative and having a pH sufficient to maintain substantially all of the initial concentration of ascorbate derivative and avoid formation of ascorbate de gradation products during heat sterilization. A preferred solution includes at least about 90 of the presterilization ascorbate and adenine but is free of dextrose.
