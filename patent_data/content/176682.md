## Description
MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION BETWEEN AN INDUSTRIAL VEHICLE GEAR LEVERAND THE GEARBOXThis invention relates to a mechanical transmission between an industrial vehicle gear lever and the gearbox, which allows transmission of the movements required for selecting and engaging the various gear wheel pairs of said gearbox.The transmission according to the utility model is of the type which enables the gear lever to be separated in order to allow the floor of the tiltable cab of the vehicle to which said lever is connected to be raised.Known transmissions of this type comprise substantially a transmission bar having one end configured as a crank to be connected to the gear lever, and the other end connected to the gearbox itself by means suitable articulated joints. The said crank configured end is normally provided with a ball joint element arranged to house a corresponding spherical head provided on the end of the gear lever, and the transmission bar is secured to the vehicle frame in such a manner as to be able to move axially and to rotate substantially about the axis of said crank.With this constructional arrangement, in order to select a suitable gear, the gear lever is operated in such a manner as to rotate said crank and consequently the transmission bar, whereas in order to engage a required pair of gear wheels, the gear lever is operated in such a manner as to cause the engagement transmission bar to undergo translational movement When the vehicle cab is to be raised from the frame by causing it substantially to rotate about a shaft disposed in the front end of said cab, the gear lever rises together with the cab floor, and thus the said spherical head provided on the end of said lever becomes separated from the ball joint element provided on the said crank configured end.Mechanical transmissions of the described type have certain drawbacks.Firstly, auch transmissions cannot be used if the vehicle cab is able to above relative to the vehicle frame, as happens in those constructions which comprise an elastic system between the cab and frame in order to provide a further suspension between the former and latter for improving running comfort This is because in such a case, the position of the spherical head at the end of the gear lever varies at every instant relative to the corresponding seat in the transmission crank, and a stable connection between said parts cannot therefore be attained. Furtheroore, even when this supplementary suspension between the cab and frame is entirely absent, and thus no relative movements are produced between said head and the relative seat in the crank, the operation by which the gear lever becomes connected to the crank cannot be performed smoothly, but instead impacts usually occur between the head and seat which can give rtse to noise and ultimately damage said parts. Finally, if the position of said parts relative to each other has not been adjusted in a sufficiently correct manner1 the engagement between the head and seat can easily produce overloading of the crank or gear lever, and this can result in damage to said members.The object of the present invention is to provide a mechanical transmission between a heavy vehicle gear lever and th gearbox which is of the initially stated type and which obviates the described drawbacks, in particular by oaklng it possible to obtain correct connection between the lever and transmission even when the vehicle cab is suspended elastically relative to the vehicle frame, and in addition allowing the operations required for irking and breaking the connection between the lever and transmission to be performed smoothly and without impacts, and making correct operation possible even when the position of the gear lever has not been perfectly adjusted relative to the other parts of the transmissionThis object is attained according to the invention by a mechanical transmission between a heavy vehicle gear lever and the gearbox which is arranged to allow transmission of the movements required for selecting and engaging the gear wheel pairs of the gearbox, and to be separated from said gear lever in order to allow the base wall of the vehicle cab to which said lever is connected to be raised, said transmission comprising substantially a transmission bar having an end part configured as a crank and provided with a ball joint element arranged to house a corresponding spherical head provided on the end of said gear lever, said transmission bar being secured to the frame in such a manner as to be able to move axially and to rotate substantially about the axis of said crank, characterised in that said crank comprises a rocker lever, of which one end is hinged to said crank and the other end is provided with said ball joint element, the hinge connection between said rocker lever and said crank being made in such a manner as to enable said crank to rock substantially in the centre plane of the crank, said lever being supported elastically by a spring.The present invention will be more apparent from the description of two different embodiments thereof given by way of example hereinafter with reference to the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a section through the end part of the transmission according to the invention Figure 2 is a section through the end part of a different embodiment of the transmission according to the invention.With reference firstly to Figure 1, the mechanical transmission according to the invention is arranged for connection between the gear lever 1 of an industrial vehicle and the gearbox of said vehicle not shown . Said lever is fixed to the base wall 2 of the vehicle cab by a ball joint connection.For this purpose, the lever is provided with an enlargement 3 bounded by a substantially spherical surface and inserted into seats of corresponding shape provided in a pair of rings 4 fixed to said wall. Conveniently1 said lever is also provided with a spiral spring S, one end of which rests on a cup 6 which rests on the ring 4, and the other end of which rests on a bush 7 fixed to said lever, in order to keep said lever constantly in a configuration in which its axis is substantially vertical.The transmission between the lever 1 and gearbox comprises subs tan tially a transmission bar 8, of which only one end is shown in Figure 1, and which is secured to the vehicle frame in such a manner as to be able to undergo the bovement which are required for selecting and engaging the gear wheel pairs of the gearbox. For this purpose, it comprises an end pin 9 engaged in a ball joint 10 housed in the upper end of a rocker lever 13, the lower end of which is hinged to the frame in such a manner as to enable it to rock substantially in the plane of Figure 1. The other end of the bar ts connected to the vehicle gearbox by suitable couplings in a manner not shown. The transmission according to the invention comprises a crank 14 connected to the pin 9 of the bar 8 and having substantially a hub part 15 and a radial projection 16. The transmisssion also comprises a rocker lever If, one end of which is hinged to the projection 16 by means of a pin 18, and the other end of which comprises a ball joint element 19. This latter is provided substantially with a spherical seat 20 arranged to constitute a housing for a spherical head 21 provided on the end 22 of the gear lever 1. Conveniently1 said spherical seat is formed inside a bush 23 of synthetic material disposed in a corresponding housing formed in said end.Conveniently, in order to enable said bush to be fixed to the initially stated end, said bush is provided with a plurality of radial teeth 25 projecting from the lower surface of the bush and arranged to snap elastically against a shoulder 26, as shown in Figure 1.Above and in proximity to the spherical seat 20 there is provided a substantially conical wall 30, the conical inner surface 31 of which substantially blends into the surface of the spherical seat 20.The rocker lever 17 is supported elastically by means of a spiral spring 32, of which one end is fixed to a projection 33 on said lever and the other end is fixed to a projection 34 on the hub 15 of the crank 14.Said spring is disposed in a position such as to support the rocker lever 17 substantially in a horizontal positionThe embodiment of Figure 2 differs from that of Figure 1 only in that the rocker lever 17 comprises two separate parts connected together in an adjustable manner so as to be able to vary the overall length of the lever. For this purpose, one of said parts, indicated by 17a, is provided with a threaded shank 35 arranged for insertion into a corresponding threaded bore 36 provided in the other part 17b of said lever. Conveniently, a locking screw 37 enables the two parts 17a and 17b to be set in a required position.The operation of the described transmission is as follows.When the gear lever 1 is connected to the other part of the transmission as shown in the figures, le in which the spherical head 21 of said lever is inserted into the corresponding spherical seat 20 of the rocker lever 17, the lever can be operated in order to transmit the movements required for selecting and engaging the gears. The selection movements are obtained by moving the lever 1 in planes substantially orthogonal to the plane of the figures so as to transmit, by way of the rocker lever 17 and crank 14, a moment such as to cause said crank to rotate about the axis of the pin 9 and thus to cause the transmission bar 8 to rotate about the same axis.When the movements required for engaging the gears are to be transmitted, the lever 1 is moved in planes substantially parallel to the plane of the figures, so that forces acting substantially in said plane are transmitted to the bar 8 by way of the rocker lever 17, to cause the rocker lever 13 to rock in the same plane.When the vehicle cab is rotated about the front shaft of said cab and thus its floor 2 is raised, the spherical head 21 of the lever 1 separates from the corresponding seat 20. Under such circumstances, the rocker lever 17 is supported by the spiral spring 32 which, in the absence of forces transmitted to the seat 20 by the head 21, tends to retain said lever in a more raised position than that shown Sn the figures. Subsequently, when the cab is lowered, the engagement between the spherical head and the seat 20 is smooth and progressive because of the presence of the spring 32, which follows the rocking motion of the lever 17 during this operation.If the floor 2 moves relative to the vehicle frame during vehicle operation by virtue of suspensions not shown interposed between said cab and the frame, the head 21 of the lever 1 undergoes substantially vertical movements, which simply cause the lever 17 to rock about the pin 18.During the operations involved in engaging the head 21 in the seat 20, the conical surface 31 is able to act as a guide in producing said engagement, and this is possible even if the gear lever has been moved into any other position than the idle position in which the lever axis is substantially vertical.It is therefore apparent that with the transmission according to the invention it is possible to obtain correct transmission of the move ments required for controlling the gearbox, even when the base wall 2 of the cab moves relative to the vehicle frame, as happens when the cab is suspended elastically relative to said frame. Moreover, the operations involved in making the connection between the gear lever and the other parts of the transmission are simple and facilitated, and are effected without impact, and with considerable smoothness under gradual progression. Finally, no very precise setting of the gear lever and other transmission components is required, neither are abnormal stresses generated in the transmission components during operation due to incorrect component setting. It is apparent that modifications can be made both to the shape and to the arrangement of the various components of the described trans mission without leaving the scope of the invention
