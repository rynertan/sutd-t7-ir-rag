## Description
PLASTICIZER COMPOSITIONS Background of the Invention This invention elates to plasticizers for vinyl chloride polymer films and plastisols used in production of suc films. In particular, the invention relates to plasticizers with which such plastisols and films can be made using relatively small amounts of plasticizing esters and to the production of highly stain resistant vinyl chlor ide polymer films. Efforts to develop such films are especially important in the vinyl floor covering industry due to the much greater consumer appeal of flooring resistant to common stalnants including shoe polish, mustard, road surfacing materials such as asphalt, etc. In general, it is very desirable to produce plasticized vinyl chloride polymer films without the costs of intensive mixing of polymer and plasticizer, e.g. in aBanbury mixer. Thus for economic reasons, the expedient of plastisol application of vinyl chloride polymer films is employed whenever feasible.In accordance with that technique, now well known in the art, finely divided vinyl chloride polymer hereinafter VCP is essentially uni firmly dispersed in an amcunt cf plasticizer sufficient to form a plastisol normally at ambient temperature of viscosity low enough for reasonably rapid escape of entrained air and for convenient casting of the plastisol on a solid surface where it will be fused to form an essen tially homogenecus, molten film and ten cooled to solidif that films. in addition, the amount of plasticizer employed must be sufficient to provide satisfactory plasticization of the film as shown by its flexibility, percent elongation at break, etc In general, plasticizers used in preparation of such plastisols are advantageously carboxylic acid esters such as alkyl benzyl phthalates, Aialkyl phthalates, alkyl benzoates, etc. Various diluents, e.g. hydrocarbons which flash off during plastisol processing, may help maintain a desirably low plastisol viscesity but not substantially enhance the plasticizing of the resulting film. In addition, use of an excess of such diluents may contribute to other problems such as blooming from the film of soaps present in VCP from its production by emulsion polymerization.Thus a certa in amount of prime ester i.e., ester which remains in the VCP film or other composition after fusing d solidification of the VCP plastisol is normally con sidered necessary in plastisol application of VCP, and it is usually expected that the required amount of such prime ester will e from 35 to 7 or more parts per hundred parts by weight of the VC . See, for example, Vinyl DIspersionCoatings for Foam Floorings and Fabrics , L. G.Friedman,Soc. of Plastics Engineers, 28th Annual Technical Conference, pp. 226 31 1971 and Vol. 3, Encyclopedia of PVC, Marcell Dekker, Inc., New York and Basel, p. 1426 l9 77 . Unfortunately, the staining tendency cf the resulting VCP film is typically more or less proportional to the amount of plasticizing ester present in the film an consequently, it is highly desirable to identify an ester containing plasticizer composition which can be used to provide an attractively low plastisol viscosity and good plasticization of te resulting 1.1 he used in amounts small enough to interfere relatively little with the natural stain resistance of the V P. Thus it is an object of this invent ion to provide a mere efficient plasticizer composition such that p plastisol appl ea films produced therewith are more highly stain resistant. Other objects are VCP compositions containing such a plasticiter composition and, in particular, a relatively small but adequately plasticizing amount of such a plasticizer composition. Another object is to provide VCP plastisol compositions which can be cast in a film on a solid surface, fused and then cooled to provide a solid, plasticized film e.g. a floor covering wear layer having 2 high degree of stain resi stance. Other objects include the resulting stain resistant floor covering wear layers and other solid films. Another object is the provision of a method for producing such VCP plastisols and the stain resistant floor covering wear layers and other solid films made from such plastisols Other objects will be apparent from the following disclosure in which all parts and percentages are by weight except where otherwise noted and phr represents parts par hundred parts by weight of VCP in any given composition Summary of the Invention In accordance with this invention, the aforedescribed objects are achieved by use of a plasticizer position containing by weight from about 50X to about 90 prime ester at least about 40 parts per hundred parts by weIt of which is aromatic diester selected from alkyl ben zyl succinates, glutarates and mixtures thereof in which said alxyl contains from about 3 to about 6 carbon atoms, from about 10 to about 50 non aromatic dieste having a molecular weight from about 230 to about 320 and, optionally, up to about 20 essentially non olefinic hydrocarbon beiling between about 2000 and about 3250C. In addition, the inven tion provides VCP compositions comprising a plasticizing amount of such a plasticizer composition. Also provided are highly stain resistant floor covering e.g. vinyl sheet flooring wear layers and other solid films prepared from such plasticized polymer compositions, and plastisols of such polymer compositions for use in production of such films.Also provided is a method for producing a C compsition which can be used to prepare such highly stain resistant films, which method comprises dispersing finely divided particles of the polymer and a plasticIzing amount of such a plasticizer composition. Detailed Description of the Invention As used herein, the term vinyl chloride polymer or VCP includes vinyl chloride homopolymer hereinafter polyvinyl chloride or PVC and vinyl chloride copolymers in which the structure of polyvinyl chloride is interspersed with residues of other olefinically unsaturated compounds copolymerized therewith. Essential properties of the polymer structure of polyvinyl chloride are normally retained if the monomers are at least about 60 vinyl chloride. Suitable comonomers include, e.g. maleic anhydride, vInyl esters such as vinyl acetate, and many others as suggested in U.S. Patent 2,943,949 issued July 5, 196 to R. K. etry, the disclosure of which is Incorporated herein by reference. This invention further relates most advantageously, although not exclusively, to VCP compositions which are essentially unfilled, i.e., not containing a substantial amount of the fillers generally inorganic, e.g. clay, talc, CaCO3, TiO2, BaSO4, asbestos, etc. with which such compositions are commonly extended for various uses such as rigid vinyl asbestos floor tile and the like.Thus, the invention has particular applicability to VCP compositions consisting essentially of VCP and a plnsSicizer therefor, which compositions are especially attractive for use in production of transparent or translucent films which may also contain, if desired, minor proportIons of conventional additives such as colcrants, stabilizers, etc., not incompatible with production of plastisol applied films from such compositions. As aforesaid, this invention utilizes alkyl benzyl succinates, glutarates and mixtures thereof, i.e. diesters of succinic and or glutaric acid in which a benzyl radical is directly attached to one carboxy group of the acid and an alkyl radical is directly attached to the other carboxy group of that acid. The alkyl radical in such diesters may be from about C3 to about C . In most embodiments it is preferably from C3 to C5, and even more typically it is preferably C4 butyl Branching of the alkyl radical is generally advantageous but not necessary. In many embodiments, the descending order of alkyl desirability Is isobutyl, n butyl, sec butyl, necpentyl, isopropyl and isoamyl.These diesters may be prepared as descrIbed in U.S. Patent 3,483,247 issued December 9,1969 to R. H. Mills. Diesters consisting essentially of either such glutarates or succinates can be satisfactorily employed in this invention as can blends of such succinates and glutarates in virtually any proportions. It has been discovered that such alkyl benzyl succinates and or glutarates provide or assist in providing good plasticization of VCP plastisols and solid films made therewith, in many embodiments at low enough total amounts of prime ester that the resulting films have unusually high stain resistance.This invention or Is based on the discovery that the use of such succinates and or glutarates in the plasticIzIng of such films and plastisols, especially at such relatively low levels of prime ester, is greatly facilitated by inclusion of the succinates and or glutarates in a plasticizer composition containing, as aforesaid, from about 50 to about 90 prime ester including such succinates manor glutarates and from about 10 to about 50 nonaromatic diester having a molecular weight frcm about 230 to about 320. Examples of such non aromatic diester include various dialkyl esters of alkane dicarboxylic acids such as dialhyl e.g. dibutyl succinate and or glutarate, dialkyl e.g. dimethyl or diethyl adipate and, usually most desirably, a texanol ester of C3 C6 alkyl monccarboxylic acid such as, e.g. one of the butyric acids.As usec herein, texanol represents the alcohol named 2,6,6,S tetramethyl 4 oxa 3 oxo nonan 7 ol under Amenical Chemical SocletyChemical Abstract terminclogy and having the following structural formula EMI5.1 Especially useful in some embodiments of this invention is the diester rr ade by reaction of that alcohol with isobutyric acid, referred to hereinafter as texancl isobutyrate MW 286 In most embodiments of the invention this non aro matic diester essentially completely volatilIzes during fusing of the VPC plastisol, but there is generally no significant disadvantage if such volatilizing is less than complete inasmuch as such diester can serve as an excellent secondary plasticizer and case hardening ester and also has good stain resistance properties. The plastisizers of this invention may be compositions consisting essentially of prime ester and the afore mentioned non aromatic diester. Optionally, however, and typically advantageously for reasons of economy, such plasticizer compositions may also contain a minor proportion. preferably not more than about 20 of a diluent which further lowers the viscosity of VCP plastisols produced therewith but essentially completely volatilizes during fusing of the plastisol such that little or none remains in solid film produced from such plastisol. Desirably such a diluent is essentially non olefinic hydrocarbon s boiling between about 200 and about 325 C. preferably between about 250 and about 300 C. . Advantagecusly, such diluent is predominantly composed of monocyclic alkylbenzenes containing from about 14 to about 24 carbon atoms and in which each alkyl substituent on the benzene ring contains from about 6 to about 16 carbon atoms preferably from about 8 to about 14, and most desirably from about 10 to about 12 carbon atoms . ost conveniently such alkylbenzenes are monoalkylbenzenes. Good results are obtained by use of diluent consisting essentially of such alkylbenzenes, but such diluent may also satisfactorily contain a minor pro portion of other hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins and the like, which do not intolerably alter its characteristies of volatility and utility in this invention. Thus in general, the plasticizer compositions of this invention contain, and in preferred embodiments consist essentially of from about 50 to about 90 prime ester, from about 10 to about 50 of the aforementioned nonaromatic ester and up to about 20 of such a hydrocarbon diluent.In preferred embodiments, those proportions ere typically from about 60 to about 80 prime ester, from about 10 to about 30 of the non aromatic ester and from about 5 to about 15 hydrocarbon diluent. Even more preferred for most uses are plastici2er compositions in which those proportions are from about 65 to about 75 prime ester, from about 15 to about 25 of the non aromatic ester and from about 5 to about 15 hydrocarbon diluent. After thorough mising of such a. plasticizer andVCP, the resulting plastisol is cast in a film on a solid surface, fused on that surface and then cooled below Its freezing point to prov ide a solid, essentially homogeneous film which may be stripped from that surface or permitted to remain thereon for its intended end use, e.g. as a floor covering wear layer. The techniques of producing solid VCP films by casting, fusing and cooling such plastisols are known in the art, and are to be distinguished from production of solid vinyl tile made by dryblending and calendaring a mixture of VCP and placticizer. Most commonly in accordance with this invention, plastisol is applied to the surface on which it will be fused by flow or dip molding, rotary screen printing or reverse roll or knife coating.Normally the resulting film is semi rigid. Although it is feasible to include a blowing agent int he plastisol, it is more common to omit a blowing agent such that the resulting film is essentially non cellular. Presently, an impentant utility of such plastisolapplied film is a VCP sheet flooring wear layer applied to a plasticized, foamable VCP gel layer which may be situated on any of various suitable solid sub trates, for example asbestos or otner paper Impregnated with a binder e.g. acrylic or SBR latex , suitable release paper, oven cr non woven e.g. felted fabric of organic and or inorganic fixers, or sheet thermoplastic material. Normally such a wear layer is applied in a thicknesa which, after fusing and cooling, is between about 0.2 and about C.9 mm. The multi layered structure thus assembled is then passed through an oven in which it is heated to 2 temperature sufficient to fuse the two plasticized VCP layers. Teon niques for the production of such floor covering are wellknown in the art. See. U.S. Patents 3,293,094 and 3,294,108 issued December 20 , 1966 and 2,961,332 issued November 22, 1960 to R. F. Cairn et al. and 3,196,030 issued July 20, 1965 to R.K. Petry, the disclosures of which are incor po rated herein by reference. In general, the amount of plasticizer composition included in a VCP composition of this invention is a plasticizing amount, i .e. an amount suffIcient to permit convenient plastisol application of VCP and provide suitably.plasticized film produced therwith. Normally, such a plasticizing amount is at least about 30 phr, even more typically at least about 35 ph and most commonly between about 35 and about 50 phr. As aforesaid, the plasticizer compositions of this invention are especially attractive in that they facilitate the plasticizing of VCP films and plastisols using relatively low levels c prime ester at which the films have unusually high stain resistance.For example, in embodiments of the InventIon usir. prime ester consisting essentially of the aforementioned succinates and or glutarates, the amount of prime enter which is satisfactory from the standpoint of adequate VCP plasticization is typically less than 35 phr and In many Instances neeW not be more than about 30 phr.Usually in. those embodiments the amount of such succinates and or glutarates employed is at least about 20 phr, and best results are normally attained using at least about 25 phr, although there is considerable flexibility in the amount employed depending on the use of diluents, secondary plasticizers, etc. In other embodiments in which such succinates and or glutarates are used in combination with other prime ester, the succinates and or glutarates plasticize the VCP plastisols and films with such great efficiency that when at least about 40 of the prime ester employed is such succinates and or glutarates, the total amount of prime ester required is generally less than 55 phr and the resulting films are similarly characterized by unusually high stain resistance.In those embodiments in which such succinates and or glutarates are at least about 60 of the prime ester employed, the total amount o required prime ester is generally not more than about 30 phr and the resulting films are typically even more exceptional in stain resIstance. Even in embodiments in which the amount of prime ester employed is 35 pbr r more and the succinates and or glutarates make up less than about 40 but a substantial proportion e.g. at least about 5 of the prime ester employed, the succinates and or glutarates replace enough of the other prime esttr used therewith that the total amount of prime ester required for adequate plasticization is substantially less than that normally required without use of such succinates and or glutarates. For instance, in plastisols and films in which about 50 phr of other prime ester such as butyl benzyl phthalate or z mixture of texanol benzoates is normally required, the inclusion of about 10 phr of the aforementioned succinates and or glu tarates typically lowers the amount of such other prime ester required for use therewith to about 30 rhr and corespondingly lowers the total amount of prime ester required to about 40 phr. The following specific examples of this invention are included for illustration only and do not imply any limitations on the scope of the invention. Preparation of Plasticizers Plasticizer A is prepared by thoroughly mixing 70 parts isobutyl benzyl succinate, 20 parts texanol isobutyrate and 10 parts hydrocarbon composed of 67.5 linear alkylben zenes boiling at 274 295 C. in which the alkyl is from C9 to C14 99 C10 C12 and 32.5 of a recycle stream 12 of such alkylbenzenes, 3 C3 C16 olefins and 85 C8 C16 paraffins with the average being C13 fro production o such alkylbenzenes. Plasticizer B is prepared likewise except there is substituted for the isobutyl benzyl succlnate an equal amount of a minture of two parts laobutyl benzyl glutarate and one part isobutyl benzyl succinate.Plasticizers C, D and E are ikewise prepared except that in each, an equal amount of n butyl benzyl succinate, sec butyl benzy succinate or isopropyl benzyl glutarate, respectively, is substituted for the isobutyl benzyl succinate used in rreparation of Plasticizer A. For comparative purposes there are hereinafter used the following commercially available PVC plasticizers Plasticizer F 78 texanol benzyl phthalate and 22 do . decyl benzene Plasticizer G 60 texanol benzoate, 25 texanol dibenzoate, 14 texanol isobutyrate or benzoate and 1 texanol.

In com parative stain resistance evaluations, DuPont Oil Yellow Dye 0.5 in odorless kerosene is dripped onto a 2.5 cm. square piece or num 2 filter paper lying horizontally on a sample of each wear layer at room temperature until saturation of the paper. Thirty minutes later, the filter papers are removed and the wear layer samples a re blotted and wiped wit mineral spirits.In parallel testing, a semi solid road surfacing material of moderate staining tendency is spread with a spatula on another sample of each wear layer and, after thirty minutes, wiped off with mineral spirits. The stains remaining on the wear layer samples are then visually evaluated according to a scale on which one represents no visible stain and 12 represents severe staining. Duplicate samples are wrapped in aluminum foil and then oven aged at 40 C.for 16 hours before staining.
