## Description
TITLE COMBINED VACUUM CLEANER AND STEAM IRON Cenerally, a conventional iron for pressing clothes is always so constructed that it can only be used for smoothing clothes. Similarly, the conventional vacuum cleaner also can only be used for cleaning floors, carpets or the like by drawing in air and dust together.However, it has been known that up to now there has no an apparatus able to function as a vacuum cleaner and a steam iron by means of a combination thereof. The first object of Lhe present invention is to provide a combination of steam iron and vacuum cleaner which is inexpensive in production and simple in construction. The second object of the present invention is to provide a combination of steam iron and vacuum cleaner which is subjected to be operated. The third object of Lhe present invention is to provide a combination of steam iron and vacuum cleaner comprising a housing having a substantially flat bottom, which housing being provided with a chamber for containing water and another chamber for collecting dusL, a heating device mounted in the water chamber by which sLeaiii is gciierarc cl and Liltis discharged Iroin Lhe bottom of the water chamber throngh a passage formed in the chamber, means for connecting various suction tubes, which means being formed integrally with the housing, a casing connected with the housing, in which casing a motor and a fan are provided for generating a suction force which is operable to draw dust through a suction tube into the dust chamber. One embodiment of the present invention will be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a combined vacuum cleaner and steam iron according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention FIGS. 2 to 4 are partially perspective views showing that a suction tube is attached to a connecting means formed on the bottom of the housing FIG. 5 is a perspective view analogous Lo FIG. 2 showing that a brush is received and held in a recess formed on the bottom of the housing FIG. 6 is a perspective view of the housing according to the present invention FIG. 7 is a segmantary view of the casing according to the present invention and FIG. 8 is a vertically secLi nal view of the apparatus according to the present invention. referring now to the accompanying drawings, and initially to FIGS. 1 and 8, a combined vacuum cleaner and steam iron according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention is schematically illustrated and indicated generally at 10. The combined vacuum cleaner and steam iron 10 basically includes a housing 12 having a substantially flat bottom, and a casing 13 connected with the housing 12 by means of a snap means 17. With reference to FIGS. 6 and 8, the housing 12 is provided with a chamber 121 for containing water, in which chamber an electrical heating device 14 is mounted for heating the water contained in the water chamber 121.The water chamber 121 is provided with a water inlet enclosed by a liquid tight cover member 123, and a steam passage 124 communicated with a plurality of holes 125 formed on the bottom surface thereof. In Lhis manner, as the apparatus 10 according to the present invention being functioned as a steam iron, steam generated by heating the waLer contained in the water chamber 121 can pass through the passage 124 and discharge from the holes 125. Besides, vlle housing 12 is further provided on the bottom with a recess 126 which can receive a brush 127, as shown in Tor 5, or clealling clotiles during ironing. Referring now to FIGS. 6 to 8, a chamber 15 for collecting dust and a cylindrical recess 16 for receiving a fan 17 are formed on the housing 12. As shown in these drawings, the dust collecting chamber 15 communicates with the cylindrical recess 16 and is provided with a detachable cover member 151 which is substantially a fabric screen edged by a frame of rigid material such as plastics material. A motor 18 is mounted within the casing 13, a transmission shaft 181 of which motor 18 is connected with a fan 17 which is normally located within the cylindrical recess 16. The casing 13 is provided around the sides thereof with slots 131 for dissipating heat energy generated by the motor 18. With reference to FIG. 8, the cylindrical recess 16 is open at the bottom end, around the open end of which recess 16 a connecting means 161 is formed integrally with the housing 12, which connecting means 161 can connect various suction tubes, as shown inFLOGS 2 Lo 4, when the apparatus 10 according to the presenL invention is intended to be functioned as a vacuum clealler. Normally, the connecting means 161 and thtis the open end of the cylindrical recess 16 is covered by a cover l anel 162 whelp the apparatus IO is functioned as a s Lcaln iron. When operation, as shown in FIGS. 2 to 4 and 8, the rotation of fan 17 driven by the motor 18 causes air in the cylindrical recess 16 to be propelled into the dust collecting chamber 15. Therefore, there is produced a suction force in the cylindrical recess 16 relative to the lower open end thereof and thus such suction force can be induced about the opening of the suction tube connected to the open end of the cylindrical recess 16. When air together with dust is sucked into the dust collecting chamber 15 through the suction tube and the cylindrical recess 16, air will pass through the screen of the cover member 151 and dust will be gathered in the dust collecting chamber 15. In this manner, as shown in FIGS. 2 to 4, to adapt various cleaning works, a variety of suction tubes such as a tube having or not having a brush can be selectively applied to the connecting means 161 of the housing 12. The present invention has been described in details above for purposes of illustration only and is not intended to be limited by this description or otherwise to exclude any variation or equivalent arrangement that would be apparent from, or reasonably suggested by the forgoing disclosure to the skill of the arL.
