# Vibration damped rivet bucking tool.

## Abstract
A rivet bucking tool 10 is provided with a damping piston 13 actuated by air pressure in a damping chamber 42 of the tool housing 11 of sufficient volume to isolate the housing 11 from undesirable vibration. The piston 13 forms an assembly with a bucking die 23 so as to inertially restrain recoil jointly therewith. A pressure reduction valve 28 is provided of the tool 10 for selectively setting the pressure in the damping chamber 42 to produce an elastic force bias on the assembly approxi mately equal to the optimal manual bucking force required for properly forming the rivet head and bucking in the riveting work at hand.
