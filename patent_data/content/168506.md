## Description
This invention reales to a product containinggamma globulin suitable for intravenousadministration and a process for producing theproduct. USP 4,126,605 Schneider describes a processfor obtaining a product suitable for intravenousadministration from Cohn Fraction II gammaglobulin. Cohn Fraction II is dissolved in abuffered aqueous solution at pH 6.7. The solutioncontains hydroxyethyl starch. After filtering thesolution, polyethylene glycol is added to a concentrationof 10 . After removal of the precipitate,additional polyethylene glycol is added tothe solution to a concentration of 20 . Theprecipitate which results is improved unmodifiedgamma globulin suitable for intravenous use. USP 4,165,370 Coval describes a process forobtaining a product suitable for intravenousadministration from Cohn fraction II gammaglobulin. Cohn fraction II is dissolved in solutionhaving an acid pH of 4.8 to 6.5 and a low ionicstrength, i.e., having a conductance of about 300 10 In the above mentioned processes, the yields ofpure gamma globulin are about 30 of thegamma globulin of the Cohn Fraction II. Modificationshave been made to increase yields, butthe increased yield has generally been at theexpense of purity. An increased yield at constantquality of the product has not yet been possible. It is an object of the present invention to isolategamma globulin of high purity, suitable forintravenous use, in high yield. An improved process for preparing gammaglobulin suitable for intravenous administrationcomprising The gamma globulin useful as the startingmaterial for the product and process of the currentinvention is well known in the art. A particular process for the precipitation andisolation of gamma globulin from blood is knownby the name Cohn Method Cohn et al., J.Amer. Chem. Soc., Vol. 68, pp. 459 475 and Vol.72, pp. 465 474 or Cohn Fraction II . This gamma globulin preparation, unsuitablefor intravenous use, is dissolved in an aqueoussolution at a neutral pH. The aqueous solution has a low ionic strength.The low ion concentration can be derived fromsalt present in the starting gamma globulin preparationor can be due to added buffer. Allphysiologically tolerated salts are suitable asbuffers. These include phosphate, citrate andtrihydroxy ethyl amino methane. The ionic concentration can be within the rangeof 0.001 0.015 mol l. If buffer is added, it ispreferred that the range be 0.01 0.015 mo l. The pH of the solution can be adjusted to7.0 0.1 by addition of a suitable acid or base, forexample, citric acid, sodium citrate or, if needed,sodium hydroxide. It has been found that the higher the ionicconcentration, the lower the temperature of thesolution should be. If no additional buffer is used,the temperature of the solution may be roomtemperature. If the ionic concentrate is between.01 .015 mol l, the temperature should bebetween 5 15 C. The gamma globulin is dissolved in the solutionin a concentration of 1 7 by weight. Preferably,the concentrate is 3.1 4.9 . Also present in the solution may be hydrocolloid such as hydroxyethyl starch, dextrose,albumin, polyalcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidoneas disclosed in USP 4,126,605. After the gamma globulin has been dissolved,the insoluble impurities are removed from thesolution by, for example, decantation, filtration,or centrifugation. To the resultant supernatant is added polyethyleneglycol PEG having a molecular weightbetween 2000 6000. Preferably, the PEG willhave a molecular weight average of 4000. The PEG may be added to the supernatant inbulk, as a powder or as solution having PEGdissolved therein. PEG is added at room temperature to theseparated solution to a concentration of 3 6 byweight, preferably 4.0 5.5 by weight. It is important to add a citrate buffer to thegamma globulin solution just prior to adding PEGin one of PEG addition steps. The buffers usefulare listed above. The ionic concentration of thesolution after the addition of buffer should be0.025 0.25 mol l. After the PEG is added to the 3 6 concentration,a precipitate is formed. The precipitate isremoved by decantation, filtration or centrifugation. The concentration of PEG in the solution isincreased to 9 16 by weight by the addition ofPEG. The temperature of the solution at this stepmay be reduced to 0 10 C, however, it mayremain at room temperature. The purified immunoglobulin which precipitatesafter increasing the concentration of PEGis then separated by means of gentle separationprocedures, for example, decantation, filtration orcentrifugation. Preferably, the separation is bymeans of centrifugation. The obtained purified gamma globulin isnative, has low ACA and is suitable for use inproducts for intravenous administration. The purified gamma globulin is preferably dissolvedin aqueous solution at a concentration of2 10 , preferably about 5 . The solutions mayalso contain buffer, e.g., citrate and or phosphate,sugar, e.g. glucose, maltose, sucrose, and anisotonicity agent, e.g. NaCl. Preferred are solutions containing 2 3 byweight glucose and 5 50 mmol l sodium citratewith a pH of 7. In the process of the current invention yieldsare obtained of 70 or more of high qualityproduct based on the amount of gamma globulinin the starting material.
