# Brake booster.

## Abstract
A brake booster includes a valve member 50, 150 which is operable to communicate fluid pressure to a pres sure chamber 26 for generating a power assist during braking. The brake booster provides an auxiliary chamber 60, 160 to trap fluid pressure leakage past the valve mem ber. An input member 54, 154 is operable during braking to initially vent the auxiliary chamber and thereafter to control operation of the valve member.
