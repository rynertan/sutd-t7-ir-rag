# Pulverized coal relative flow measurement.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring the relative flow of pulverized coal in a plurality of pipes 10 connected between a common pulverizer 12 and respective burners comprises a plurality of electric charge sensors 26 each disposed in a similar position on the plurality of pipes. The electric charge sensors 26 sense an induced signal produced by charged pulverized coal particles. For unbiased flow, the induced signal is proportional to the amount of flow in each pipe 10 as the charge properties of the particles from the pulverizer are the same for all the pipes. A circuit 32 is connected to the sensors 26 for obtaining a root mean square value of the induced signal, which in turn is compared 34 to each induced signal respectively to obtain a measurement of the relative flow in each pipe 10 . The induced signal can be integrated twice 36 to improve the correlation between flow and charge amount, since the integrated value is independent of radial position for the charges in the pipes 10 .
