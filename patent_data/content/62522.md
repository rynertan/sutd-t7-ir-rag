# Proximity coupled electro optic devices.

## Abstract
A proximity coupled electro optic device in which the electro optic element 17 has a pattern of conductors 44A...44Z applied to the surface 17A thereof abutting the individually addressable electrodes 18 applying encoded data samples. The conductors 44 are aligned in the same, or substantially the same, direction as the elec trodes 18 , and the period of the conductor pattern 44 is equal to or less than the maximum width of the electrodes 18 . Directional alignment tolerances between the conduc tors 44 and electrodes 18 are increased as the period of the conductor pattern 44 is decreased, and when the conductors 44 are segmented.
