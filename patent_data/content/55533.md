# Preparation of unsaturated acids and esters from saturated carboxylic acid derivatives and carbonyl compounds.

## Abstract
Promoted phosphate catalysts have been found to be effective for the vapour phase condensation of saturated monocarboxylic acids or esters with formaldehyde, to pro duce unsaturated carboxylic acids or esters. These catalysts have the empirical formula A
