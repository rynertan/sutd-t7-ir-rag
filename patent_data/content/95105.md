PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 2 5,5 DISUBSTITUTED 4 OXO 2 IMIDAZOLIN 2 YL NICOTINIC ACIDS QUINOLINE 3 CARBOX fLIC ACIDS, AND BENZOIC ACIDS SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a method for the preparation of formula I , 2 5,5 disubstituted 4 oxo or thiono 2 imidazolin 2 yl nicotinic acids, 43 quinalinecarboxylic acids or benzoic acids having the structure EMI1.1 by the base catalyzed cyclization of a formula XVa 2 carbamoyl nicotinic acid or 2 carbamoyl 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid having the structure EMI1.2 wherein Rg is N or CH R1 is Cl C4 alkyl R2 is Cl C4 alkyl or C3 C6 cycloalkyl and when RI and R2 are taken together, along with the carbon to which they are attached, they may represent C3 C6 cycloalkyl optionally substituted with methyl, and when R1 and R2 are not the same, the optical isomers thereof W is O or S X is hydrogen, orCl C4 alkyl, Y is hydrogen, halogen, Cl C4 alkyl, Cl C4 alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, difluoromethoxy, diloweralkylamino, Cl C4 alkylthio, phenyl, phenoxy, or phenyl or phenoxy substituted with one C1 C4 alkyl, Cl C4 alkoxy or halogen Z represents hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, phenyl or phenyl substituted with one C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy or halogen and, when taken together, Y and Z may form a ring in which YZ are represented by the structure CH2 n , where n is an integer selected from 3 to 5, provided that X is hydrogen or YZ isEMI2.1 where L, M, Q and R7 each represent hydrogen, halogen, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, C1 C4 haloalkyl, difluoromethoxy, diloweralkylamino, C1 C4 alkylthio, nitro, phenyl, phenoxy, or mono substituted phenyl or phenoxy where the substituent is one C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy or halogen with the proviso that only one of L,M, Q or R7, may represent a substituent other than hydrogen, halogen, C1 C4 alkyl or C1 C4 alkoxy. The base catalyzed cyclization of this process involves reaction of a formula XVa carbamoyl nicotinic acid or carbamoyl 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid having the structure EMI3.1 where X, Y, Z, W, R1 and R2 are as described above, with from 2 to 20 moles and preferably 2 to 6 moles of an aqueous or aqueous alcoholic sodium or potassium hydroxide preferably of greater than 10 concentration on a weight basis, per mole of formula XVa acid, at a temperature between 250 and 1100C, i.e., reflux temperature. Thereafter, the reaction mixture is acidified to a pH between 2 and 4 to give, in high yield and purity, the 2 5,5 disubstituted 4 oxo or thiono 2 imidazolin2 yl nicotinic acid or 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid having the structure of formula I EMI3.2 wherein X, Y, Z, W, R1 and R2 are as described above. Advantageously, the process of the invention is also effective for preparing the formula I 2 5,5disubstituted 4 oxo or thiono 2 imidazolin 2 yl nicotinic acids and 3 quinolinecarboxylic acids from isomer mixtures of the formula XVa carbamoyl nicotinic acid or carbamoyl 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid and the formula XVb carbamoyl picolinic acid or carbamoyl quinaldic acid.In accordance with the process of the invention, the isomeric mixture containing the formula XVa carbamoyl nicotinic acid or quinolinic acid and the formula XVb carbamoyl picolinic or quinaldic acid is heated to a temperature between 25 and 110or i.e., reflux temperature with about 2 to 20 molar equivalents of aqueous or aqueous alcoholic C1 C4 alcohol sodium or potassium hydroxide, and preferably 2 to 6 molar equivalents of said base of greater than 10 concentration on a weight basis under a blanket of inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The mixture is then cooled to about 250C and acidified to a pH between 2 and 4 with a strong mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid to give the herbicidally effective formula I product in greater than 95 yields.If the formula XVa product is insoluble in water, it will be precipitated and can be recovered by filtration. If the product is soluble in water, the mixture can be extracted with an organic solvent such as ether or methylene chloride and the extract concentrated to provide the herbicidally effective 2 5,5 disubstituted 4 oxo or thiono 2 imidazolin 2 yl nicotinic or 3 quinolinecarboxylic acid encompassed by formula I . A reaction reported by A. Kjaer, Acta. Chemica. Scand 7, 889, 1953 utilizing dilute 1.ON 4 aqueous sodium hydroxide gives significantly lower yields 10 to 15 lower . The process of the invention also relates to a method for the preparation of the herbicidally effective formula I 2 5,5 disubstituted 4 oxo or thiono 2 imidazolin 2 yl nicotinic acids, 3 quinolinecarboxylic acids, and benzoic acids by reaction of an appropriately substituted formula XVI anhydride with an aminocarboxamide or aminothiocarboxamide depicted by formula XIIIa to yield an isomeric mixture of the formula XVa and formula XVb carbamoyl nicotinic, quinolinecarboxylic, or benzoic acid and the carbamoyl picolinic or quinaldic acid.This reaction is carried out, preferably using equivalent amounts of the formula XVI anhydride and the formula XIIIa carboxamide or thiocarboxamide, in the presence of an inert organic solvent such as low boiling ether diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane , acetonitrile, ethyl acetate or a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride. The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature between 200 and 800C and preferably at 300 to 600C under a blanket of inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. This reaction yields the isomeric mixture of the formula XVa carbamoyl nicotinic, 3 quinolinecarboxylic, or benzoic acids and the formula XVb carbamoyl picolinic or quinaldic acids. The isomeric mixture may then be treated as described above to recover the herbicidally effective formula IA 2 5,5 disubstituted 4 oxo or thiono 2 imidazolin 2 yl nicotinic acids, 3 quinolinecarboxylic, or benzoic acids. The above described reactions are graphically illustrated in Flow Diagram I. The herbicidal 2 5,5 disubstituted 4 oxo 2imidazolin 2 yl nicotinic acids and quinoline 3 carboxylic acids prepared according to the process of this invention are described and exemplified in the European PatentApplication Publication number 0041623 publishedDecember 16, 1981 Bulletin 81 50, Application number 81103638.3 of Marinus Los. The herbicidal benzoic acids are described and exemplified in U.S. Patent 4,188,487 1980 of Marinus Los. FLOW DIAGRAM IEMI7.1 wherein X, Y, Z, W, R1 and R2 are as described above and R9 is N or CH. Conveniently, the method of the present invention is also suitable for the preparation of the imidazolinyl quinolinic, nicotinic, and benzoic acid herbicides directly from nitriles by hydrolysis of the nitrile in situ with a strong base and hydrogen peroxide in a single operation as graphically illustrabed below EMI9.1 wherein Rg, X, f, Z, R1 and R2 are as described above. The reactions may be carried out at 0 1000C in water, a mixture of water and water miscible solvents such as C1 C4 alcohol or a mixture of water and water immiscible solvents such as dichloromethane, 1,2dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, toluene, xylenes and ethyl ether. The reactions may also be carried out inC1 C4 alcohols without the addition of water. Reactions in water at 60 1000C are preferred as cyclization to the desired imidazolinyl products is more rapid at elevated temperatures, and disposal or recovery of organic solvents is not necessary. The use of aqueous 30 90 hydrogen peroxide with alkali metal hydroxides serves to speed the conversion of the acid amidonitriles to the alkali metal cation salts of the acid diamides and results in less by product formation. The peroxide may be employed in a molar ratio of 0 to 10 moles, preferably 2 to 5 moles, per mole of acid amidonitrile. Both aqueous and aqueous alcoholic alkali metal hydroxides such as KOH, NaOH, or CA OH 2 may be employed in molar ratios of 1 to 10 moles, preferably 2 to 6 moles of 10 or greater concentration on a weight basis, per mole of acid amidonitrile. The product imidazolinyl acids are amphoteric and are capable of acting either as acids or bases.Thus, they may be isolated as the alkali metal cation salts, as the free acids, and when treated with strong acids such as hydrochloric, sulfuric and hydrobromic acids, as acid addition salts. The acid amidonitriles suitable for use as starting materials are conveniently prepared by first reacting methyl isopropyl ketone with hydrogen cyanide in aqueous ammonium hydroxide to obtain 2 amino 2,3dimethylbutyronitrile as described in the application for United States Letters Patent of Walter Stepek andMatthew Nigro, Serial No. 381,812, filed May 25, 1982, and incorporated herein by reference thereto. This compound is then reacted with the appropriate anhydride to give the acid amidonitriles. This preparation is described in United States Patent 4,017,510. The formula IA 2 5,5 disubstituted 4 oxo or thiono 2 imidazolin 2 yl nicotinic acids, 3 quinolinecarboxylic acids1 and benzoic acids, prepared by the process of the present invention, are highly effective herbicidal agents useful for the control of a wide variety of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. They are also useful as aquatic herbicides and are unique in their effectiveness in controlling plants when applied to the foliage thereof, or to the soil, or water containing seeds, or other propagating organs of the plants such as tubers, rhizomes or stolons, at rates of from about 0.025 to 8.0 kg ha, and preferably at rates from about 0.032 to 4.0 kg ha.
