DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENT ION Referring now to Fig. 1, there is shown a hand held printing apparatus of the present invention illustrated generally as 11. The hand held printing apparatus 11, has a carriage 13 adapted to be held in the hand of the user which is connected by flexible cable 15 to a remotely located electrical control means 17 and remote source of pressurized ink 19. Although the remotely located electrical control means 17 and ink source 19 are shown mounted on a wagon or dolly 21 it should be understood that the same could be mounted in a pack which would be worn by the user 23. Referring now to Fig. 2, the hand held unit is designated generally as 25 and includes a handle 27 extending from a generally rectangular carriage or housing 29. Roller means such as wheels 31 are mounted on the carriage for moving the carriage 29 over a surface to be printed such as a box or container. Wheels 31 are mounted on carriage 29 by suitable bushings 33 and an axle 35. As shown in i. . 3, an ink jet printing means is mounted on the carriage and includes a plurality of nozzles 37.Nozzles 37 are preferably located in a common nozzle block 39 which fits within a slot 41 in the front wall 43 of carriage 29. Nozzles 37 are preferably aligned in a single row which extends laterally of the direction of movement of the carriage 29 over the surface to be printed. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the nozzles 37 are located between the paths of travel of wheels 31 so that when the apparatus is in use the wheels 31 will not pass over any printing produced on the printing surface by the ink jet printing means.A follower wheel 45 can be provided to add stability to the carriage as print is being applied or wheels could be provided at four corners of the carriage 29. Each nozzle 37 comprises a single aperture for the passage of ink. Alternativel, each nozzle 37 can comprise a plurality of apertures which provide the same crosssectional area as the single aperture. The nozzles 37 are preferably jeweled orifice nozzles such as the sapphire jewels used in acetylene torches and the like. Each jeweled orifice nozzle as shown in Fig. 6 and 7 has a generally circular body 47 having an orifice 49 of relatively smaller diameter on one face 51 and an opening 53 of relatively greater diameter on the opposite face 55.The diameter of orifice 49 is in the range of 0.025mm to 0.215mm, and preferably is in the range of 0.145mm to 0.185mm. As shown in Fig. 6, each nozzle 37 is set in a nozzle block 39 preferably made of an inert material such as a suitable plastic. The nozzle block 39 has a series of generally circular recesses 57 having an internal diameter selected to receive the external diameter of the nozzle bodies 47. recesses 57 are of sufficient depth to allow the nozzles 37 to fit flush with the top surface 59 of the block 39 when the nozzles are in place. The nozzles 37 are placed in recesscs 57 with the opening 53 being first to enter the recess 57. The distance between the center of each orifice 49 when the orifices are vertically aligned is in the range of O.Olmm to 5.0mm and preferably is in the range of O.Omm to 0.50mum. A series of rigid tubes 61 lead from the nozzle recesses 57 in block 39 and project outwardly from the side of block 39 opposite recesses 57. Tubes 61 and hence nozzles 37 are each in fluid communication with the output port 63 of a valve 65 Fig. 2 located within the carriage 29 by means of fluid conduits 67. Conduits 67 are of any suitable commercially available conduit, e.g., of metal or plastic material and are preferably in the range of 0.127mm to 1.270nun in diameter. Valves 65 may be any suitable commercially available fast acting valve having an electrical time in the range of fro 0.1 to 10 milliseconds, preferably in the range of 1.0 to 4.5 milliseconds. Suitable valves can be either a single acting spring return, a double acting electromagnetic solenoid valve or a piezoelectric valve. Preferably a single acting spring return solenoid valve such as is shown in Fig. 7 is used. Such a valve 65 typically has an output port 63 and an input port 69 leading to a fluid chamber 71 within an outcr housing 73. A plunger 75 closes off output port 63 when in the position shown and has an elongated body 77 which is slidably received within a solenoid coil 79 held in place by mounting collars 81, 83.The solenoid coil and valve housing 73 are preferably coated with a suitable epoxy resin to prevent ink fluid damage. The solenoid coil 79 when energized exerts an electro magnetic force on plunger body 77 to cause the plunger 75 to move out of scaling engagement with the output port 63, allowing ink to flow out the output port. A spring 85 mounted between collar 81 and plunger 75 urges the plunger 75 into sealing engagement with the output port 63 and thus prevents the flow of ink from the fluid chamber 71 when solenoid coil 79 is de cnergized. Wires 87, 89 run from solenoid coil 79 to the control circuit of the electrical control means 17 by way of a flexible electrical cable 91. The input ports 69 of valves 65 are each in fluid communication with a common ink manifold 93by means of fluid conduits 95 which are similar to fluid conduits 69. Ink manifold 93 communicates with the pressurized ink source 19 Fig. 1 by means of a flexible ink line 97. The pressurized ink source 19 can comprise a reservoir and pressure means such as a vibrator pump to supply air pressure to the reservoir. An on off switch 99 on handle 27 is provided between solenoid valves 65 and the electrical control means 17. As shown in Fits. 2 and 4, a timing pulley 101 is mounted in carriacje 29 on a drive shaft 103. Timing pulley 101 is connected to and driven by axle 35 of front wheel 31 by means of timing elt 105. The end of drive shaft 103 opposite carriage wall 107 has an encoder disk 109 mounted thereon by suitable bushings 111 said encoder disk being associated with a photo detector assembly 113. As best scen in Fig. 4, photo detector 113 includes an elongated bar 115 having a side flange 117 in which is mounted a licg source 127 aid a matclling side flange 119 in which is mounted a photo electric sensor 129. Encoder disk 109 is suitably positioned on drive shaft 103 so that the path of travel of holes 121 along the outer periphery of disk 109 is in the path of light from the light source 127 in flange 117 and the photo detector 129 located in flange 113. Electrical leads 123, 125 running from the photo detector subassembly 113 to the electrical control means 17 carry electrical pulscs created by the movement of disk 109 and holes 121 through the light beam 131 between the source 127 and the photo cell 129. In this manner, the spacing between holes 121 on encoder disk 109 can be correlated to the distance between the columns of print generated by the electrical control means 17 on the printing surface. The ink jet printing device 25 prints a column through nozzles 37 when a hole 121 or select number of holes comes into the view of the photo detector subassembly 113. Encoder disk 109 and photo detector subassembly 113 thus comprise signal generating means associated with wheel 31 for supplying to the microcomputer electrical signals indicative of the rate at which the carriage 29 is moved over the surface to be printed. Although an encoder disk and photo detector subassembly have been shown, other signal generating means can be utilized such as fluidic or electro magnetic to perform the same function. The source of pressurized ink 19 is shown in greater detail in Fig. 9. Pressure means such as a vibrator pump 135 supply air pressure through a hose 137 to a reservoir 133 which is filled wi ilk from the top by means of a cap 139. Pump 135 is suspended within reservoir hous ing. 141 by means of resilient bands 143. A vent valve 145 in air hose 147 allows t ze air pressure to reservoir 133 to be adjusted. Air pressure in the range of 0.5 to 7 psi is acci tahlo for the present purpose. A filter 149 can he utilized to filter the ink passing through ink line 97 to manifold 93. The operation of the prevent invention will now be described in greater detail. The operation of the electrical control means 17 is sllown schematically inFig. 5. Movement of the hand held unit 25 by the user across the surface to be printed causes axle 35 Fig.2 attached to wheel 31 to rotate. Rotation of axle 35 causes corresponding rotation of drive shaft 103 through belt 105. Movement of drive shaft 103 causes holes 121 in encoder disk 109 rig. 4 to pass between the light source 127 and photo cell 129 which are mounted in the opposing flanges 117, 119 of photo detector subassembly 113. Interruption of light beam 131 causes electrical pulses to be sent through lines 123, 125 to the microcomputer 17 indicative of the speed in which the handheld unit 25 is being moved ove tulle printing surface. Microcomputer 17 has Ilccn programmed by the user through an input device 151 Fig. 5 to direct the printing of a desired character message on the printing surface. The control circuit of microcomputer 17 is electrically connected to the solenoid valves 65 Fig. 2 . Valves 65 are thtis selectively and intermittently actuated by the microcomputer 17 to allow ink to flow from manifold 93 through output ports 63 to jeweled orifice nozzles 37 and onto the printing surface. The selective actuation of valves 65 by the microcomputer 17 as the carriage 29 is moved over the printing surface allows a message to be printed in dotmatrix format with columns of the dot matrix being printed only when holes 121 in encoder disk 109 are aligned wit light beam 131. An invention has been provided with significant advantages. The ink jet print Incj apparatus is suitable for printing large size alpha numeric characters on a printing surface such as t wa1 cf a container in a warehouse and is portable and compact. The device is also simple in design and utilizes commercially available parts making it economically feasible for the intended application. While the invention has been shown in only one of its forms, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that it is not so limited but is susceptible to various changes and modifications without departing from the spirit thereof.
