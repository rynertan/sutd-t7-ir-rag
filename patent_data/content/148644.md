# A NOVEL FUSION PARTNER AND ITS PRODUCTS

## Abstract
By careful screening and mutation, a human murine hybri doma suitable as a fusion partner for immortalizing an anti body secreting B cell has been generated. The trioma fusion products of this immortalizing partner are stable producers of human monoclonal antibodies. A trioma which produces monoclonal human anti varicella zoster is disclosed. A human anti A IgM is also produced using this general method by the trioma S H22 and by an alternate hydrid, HHAI.
