# A BLOW SMELTING PROCESS USING A TOP AND BOTTOM BLOWING CONVERTER.

## Abstract
A blow smelting process employing top and bottom blowing techniques, in which part of the total oxygen feed is top blown into the convertor and, therefore, a decrease in the lime powder blowing ability dependent upon the naturally decrease bottom blown oxygen feed has previous ly caused an initial burst often taking place when no lime powder is blown in bottom blowing smelting. This process comprises bottom blowing lime powder in the pattern of CaO SiO₂ ¹ SiO₂ Kg t 13 Kg t in the initial stage of blow smelting, and 3Kg t in the terminal stage, thereby solving the problem of the initial burst and improving the efficiency of removing phosphorus in the terminal stage. This process is applied to the production of stell from molten pig iron as a main source.
