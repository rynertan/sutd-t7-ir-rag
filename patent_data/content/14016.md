## Description
A window frame having a sash window arranged in it The invention relates to a window frame having arranged therein at least one slidable sash window, which mainly consists of a framework of metal, for example, aluminium and at least one glass plate mounted therein, said window frame being made of wood and intended for direct mounting in a concrete or brick wall. Such a window frame is known. The sash window is slidably arranged in a steel window frame, which in turn is arranged in a wooden window frame to be mounted in a building. The invention has for its object to provide a simpler window frame of the kind set forth in the preamble.According to the invention this is achieved in that the sash window is provided at the top strip with at least one upper flange standing upright on the top side and engaging in a guide groove of the wooden lintel. The omission of the metal frame means an appreciable economy, whilst nevertheless perfect seal and simple mounting are obtained. For this purpose the upper flange has sealing brushes on both sides in the guide groove of the lintel. The above mentioned and further features of the invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to a drawing. The drawing shows in Figure 1 a perspective view of a window frame in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 an enlarged sectional view taken on the line II II in Figure 1, Figure 3 an enlarged sectional view taken on the line III III in Figure 1, and Figure 4 a detail IV of Figure 2 of a different embodiment. Referring to Figures 1 to 3 the window frame 1 according to the invention comprises a fixed window 2 and a sash window 3. The window frame 1 is made of wood, preferably hard wood and is directly mounted in a brick or concrete wall 4. Consequently instead of arranging first, as usual, a kind of setting frame in the wall 4, to which the window frame 1 is secured, the window frame 1 is mounted in direct contact with the bricks or the concrete of the wall 4. The sash window 3 mainly comprises an outer framework of metal, preferably, aluminium, having an upper strip 5, a lower strip 6, a first side strip 7 and a second side strip 8. The framework of the sash window 3 holds a glass plate 9 in an uninterrup ted, elastic strip 10 of synthetic resin having a U shaped profile and enclosed in an uninterrupted channel s.ection groove of the framework of the sash window 3.The upper strip 5 has on the top side an upwardly extending upper flange 11 engaging in a guide groove 12 of the wooden lintel 13 and carrying on both sides sealing brushes 14 in the guide groove 12. To this end the upper flange 11 has grooves 15 for retaining brush bodies 16. The fixed window 2 has an identical upper strip 5, the upper flange 11 of which is in sealing relationship with a groove 12. The upper flange 11 of the sash window 3 is arranged outside the longitudinal medium plane 17 of the sash window 3, that is to say, on the side facing the fixed window 2. The upper flange 11 of the fixed window 2 is located nearer the sash window 3 than the longitudinal medium plane 17 of the fixed window 2. The lower strips 6 of the two windows 2 and 3 each have a sheath 18. In the lower sheath 18 of the sash window 3 are rotatably journalled a plurality of wheels 19. The wheels 19 bear on a rail head 20 of a rail 21 fastened to a sloping upper surface 24 of a wooden lower ledge 22 of the window frame 1 by screws 23. The rail 21 is secured by the screws 23 to the lower ledge 22. The fixed window 2 bears by its lower sheath 18 on a flange 26 of a supporting head 27, which like the rail head 20 forms part of the same rail 21. The lower sheath 18 of the sash window 3 has a sealing brush 28 on either side of the rail head 20. The fixed window 2 is sealed by means of a sealing strip 50 between the sup porting head 27 and the lower sheath 18. A gutter 29 receiving the screws 23 permits water to flow away via the holes 30 along a gap 31 beneath a front edge 32 of the rail 21.The two windows 2 and 3 can be readily inserted into the window frame 1 by lifting the windows 2 and 3 above their working positions so that their upper flanges 11 extend high into the additional free spaces 25 of the grooves 12, after which they can be lowered on the supporting head 27 and the flange 26 respectively of the rail head 20. Each window 2 and 3 has on a wall side a first side strip 7 with a side flange 33, which is in sealing relationship by means of sealing brushes 34 on either side thereof with the inclined faces 35 of a sealing groove 36 in the wooden jambs 37 of the window frame 1. Above the windows 2 and 3 guard screws 38 and 39 respectively are provided for preventing lifting of these windows by thieves. The two first side strips 7 are identical. The two second side strips 8 are also identical and engage one another in sealing relationship by flanges 40 and with the aid of sealing brushes 41. One and the same window frame 1 may comprise several windows, for example, two sash windows and one fixed window. The window frame 1 according to the invention described above can be manufactured at low cost, since its number of profiles is minimized. Moreover, the corresponding strips of the fixed window 2 and the sash window 3 have identical profiles. Sealing against draught is achieved in a simple manner in grooves of the wooden window frame 1. It should be noted that each window may comprise two relatively spaced glass plates 9 rather than the single glass plate 9 mentioned above. In order to prevent water from flowing from the lower ledge 22 into the corner joint of the wooden window frame 1, the head sides of the aluminium rail 21 are provided with head partitions of synthetic resin not shown . The window frame shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 is a brick up window frame, which as shown in Figures 2 and 3 is arranged together with lathing 42 nailed to the wooden window frame 1 in the wall 4 when the two partitions 48 of the cavity are built. Figure 4, however, illustrates the method of mounting of a so called build in window frame 1. The lathing 42 is first inserted between the cavity partitions 48, if this lathing 42 is not yet present, and the window frame 1 is fastened thereto by screws 49 or nails from the grooves 12 and 36.
