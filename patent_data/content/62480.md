# Hose coupling.

## Abstract
A hose coupling in which an insert 1 is insertable within the end of the hose 3 and a ferrule 17 is swaged radially around the hose 3 to grip the hose 3 between the ferrule 17 and insert 1 is adapted to accommodate different hoses of the same nominal bore whilst having a stop member 18 on the ferrule 17 to contact an abutment 9 on the insert 1 and provide relative location therebetween before swaging, the stop member 18 being collapsible on swaging to prevent the insert 1 being crushed. A hose stop 24 may also be pro vided to position the end of the hose 13 with the coupling.
