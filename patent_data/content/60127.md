# Ion transfer membrane assembly, a method of constructing such an assembly and an electrochemical cell.

## Abstract
An ion transfer membrane 11 assembly, for electroche mical processes, is provided which includes a plurality of layers 25, 26 of capillary material and a structure 13, 14, 15, 18 for compressing the layers together to control the water permeability of the membrane 11 . Each of the plurality of layers is formed from a corrosion resistant relatively soft, film, such as a thermoplastic film, having surface manifesta tions 27, 28 formed on it, which manifestations define the capillaries. The surface manifestation may be formed by embossing, frosting, etching etc. A plurality of layers 30 of corrosion resistant, springy, porous capillary material, such as a polyester non woven web, may be interspersed with the capillary material film layers, as also may be a plurality of layers 32 of smooth surfaced film.
