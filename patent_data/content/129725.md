## Description
Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Field This invention is directed to curable molding compositions containing a mixture of a poly acrylate a polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer which serves to crosslink the poly acrylate to a thermoset product at least one of the following i one or more crosslinkable vinyl monomers having a reactivity ratio rl with styrene of greater than one, ii an epoxy compound having at least one 1,2epoxy group per molecular, and iii an unsaturated fatty acid ester and a thermoplastic polymer low profile additive. The curable molding compositions exhibit improved shrink control during the curing reaction.This invention is also directed to reinforced thermoset resin articles prepared from these curable molding compositions and containing one or more fibers with a melting point or a glass transition temperature above about 1300C which exhibit generally improved surface appearance quality. Fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles can be produced from the curable molding compositions of this invention by a very rapid injection molding process which is typically less than about two minutes from the time the cure of the resin mixture is initiated.Background of the Invention It is well known that curable polyester resin systems are widely utilized in making fiber reinforced thermoset articles. The polyesters employed in these resin systems are generally the reaction products of a dicarboxylic acid or anhydride with a polyhydric alcohol. Fiber reinforced molding composites based on polyester resins systems have been advantageously employed in both bulk molding compound BMC formulations and sheet molding compound SMC formulations. A technical improvement that has made a significant contribution to commercial polyester molding technology is the use of low profile additives to reduce shrinkage during the curing reaction and to thereby improve the dimensional stability and surface smoothness of the fiber reinforced thermoset composite. A further technical improvement that has made a significant contribution to commercial polyester molding technology is the development of chemically thickened polyester resin systems.Chemical thickening is generally always employed in sheet molding compounds SMC and is increasingly being used in bulk molding compounds BMC . In such systems, a metal oxide or hydroxide such as magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide is added to, for example1 the uncured polyester low profile additive along with fillers. glass fiber and other standard materials. The metal oxide or hydroxide interacts with residual acidity in the polyester to build viscosity. The thickened system is relatively tack free and easy to handle, and the high viscosity carries the glass fiber reinforcement to the extremities of the mold during crosslinking of the system. Other thermoset resin systems based on poly acrylates have been developed which can be used to prepare fiber reinforced molding composites by rapid injection molding technology. The poly acrylates employed in these resin systems are generally prepared by the reaction of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or their simple esters with a polyhydric alcohol. Poly acrylate resin systems generally have a relatively low viscosity so that they can be used to produce thermoset resin articles containing up to about 75 weight percent of reinforcing fibers by a rapid injection molding process. Chemical thickening is not employed in such poly acrylate resin systems.

This application additionally describes an improved process for rapidly fabricating fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles having improved mechanical properties utilizing the above described curable molding compositions therein. While poly acrylate resin systems provide for the rapid production of high performance reinforced thermoset resin articles with generally minimal surface requirements such as automotive structural components and the like, it is highly desirable that such reinforced thermoset resin articles have improved surface qualities which will allow the molded article to be used in the rapid production of surface critical articles or parts such as automobile exteriors and the like. It is highly desirable that such surface critical articles or parts have very low profile surfaces which are essentially free of warpage, undulations, fiber prominence or similar defects.There is, therefore, a need to provide curable low profile poly acrylate resin systems which exhibit reduced shrinkage during the curing reaction and thereby afford improved surface appearance in the reinforced molded articles obtainable therefrom. It has been found as a result of the present invention that curable molding compositions containing a mixture of a poly acrylate a polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer which serves to crosslink the poly acrylate to a thermoset product at least one of the following i one or more crosslinkable vinyl monomers having a reactivity ratio rl with styrene of greater than one, ii an epoxy compound having at least one 11 2 epoxy group per molecule1 and iii an unsaturated fatty acid ester and a thermoplastic polymer low profile additive exhibit improved shrink control during the curing reaction.Reinforced thermoset resin articles containing one or more fibers with a melting point or a glass transition temperature above about 1300C and prepared from the curable molding compositions of this invention also exhibit generally improved surface appearance quality.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention is directed to curable molding compositions comprising a mixture of a a poly acrylate characterized by the following empirical formula EMI9.1 wherein R is the hydroxy free residue of an organic polyhydric alcohol which contained alcoholic hydroxyl groups bonded to different carbon atoms, R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or methyl, and n is 1 to 3 b an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which is soluble in and copolymerizable with a c at least one of the following i one or more crosslinkable vinyl monomers having a reactivity ratio rl with styrene of greater than one ii an epoxy compound having at least one 1,2 epoxy group per molecule and iii an unsaturated fatty acid ester and d a thermoplastic polymer low profile additive which is soluble in the mixture of a , b and c . In a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to curable molding compositions comprising a mixture of a a poly acrylate characterized by the following empirical formula EMI10.1 wherein R is the hydroxy free residue of an organic polyhydric alcohol which contained alcoholic hydroxyl groups bonded to different carbon atoms, R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen or methyl1 and n is 1 to 3 b an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which is soluble in and copolymerizable with a c a crosslinkable vinyl monomer having a reactivity ratio rl with styrene of greater than one and at least one of the following i a second crosslinkable vinyl monomer having a reactivity ratio rl with styrene of greater than one ii an epoxy compound having at least one 11 2 epoxy group per molecule and iii an unsaturated fatty acid ester and d a thermoplastic polymer low prbfile additive which is soluble in the mixture of a , b and c . The curable molding compositions can optionally contain meta and or para divinylbenzene, an initiator1 a mold release agent, fibers, fillers and other additives. The curable molding compositions exhibit improved shrinkage control during the curing reaction and the reinforced thermoset resin products prepared therefrom exhibit generally improved surface appearance quality in comparison with curable molding compositions and reinforced thermoset resin products prepared therefrom which do not contain a thermoplastic polymer low profile additive as described herein and at least one of the following i one or more crosslinkable vinyl monomers having a reactivity ratio r1 with styrene of greater than one ii an epoxy compound having at least one 1.2 epoxy group per molecule and iii an unsaturated fatty acid ester.There is known to be a strong correlation between the cure shrinkage of a curable molding composition and the surface appearance quality of fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles prepared therefrom. The unfilled curable molding compositions of this invention have a low viscosity. i.e., from about 10 to about 1000 centipoise. preferably less than about 600 centipoise, so that they can be used to produce thermoset resin articles containing up to about 75 weight percent of reinforcing fibers by a very rapid injection molding process. A low curable molding composition viscosity is highly desirable in a rapid injection molding process in order to avoid any movement of the reinforcing fibers during the injection step. The reinforcing fibers have a melting point or a glass transition temperature above about 1300C and include, for example1 fiberglass. carbon fibers aromatic polyamide fibers, and mixtures thereof.Fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles can be produced from the curable molding compositions of this invention by a very rapid injection molding process which is typically less than two minutes1 oftentimes less than one minute, from the time the cure of the resin mixture is initiated1 The curable molding compositions do not require the use of thickening agents in the molding technology described herein. The poly acrylates useful in the curable molding compositions of this invention are advantageously compatible or soluble with a large variety of low profile additives. In the rapid fabrication of fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles1 it is important that a homogeneous solution or dispersion of poly acrylate , low profile additive and other ingredients be injected into the molding apparatus in order to provide improved surface appearance properties in the reinforced thermoset articles. A common problem with many polyester resins is the limited solubility of certain low profile additives therein and the tendency of the polyester low profile additive mixture to separate into two phases. The curable molding compositions of this invention are particularly suitable for the rapid fabrication of fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles having improved surface appearance properties. The fiber reinforced thermoset resin articles prepared from the curable molding compositions can have utility in surface critical molding articles or parts such as automobile exteriors and the like. Surface critical molding articles or parts have very low profile surfaces which are essentially free of warpage, undulations.fiber prominence and similar defects.
