# A fuse for sub munitions to be expelled from a rocket.

## Abstract
The sub munition is provided with an arming device com prising a striker member 3 , movable substantially in the direction of its longitudinal axis, and a detonator 4 carried by a slide 5 movable from a first position in which the detonator 4 is located out of the path of the striker member 3 to a second position in which the detonator is brought into the path of the said member and beneath it the striker member 3 is provided with a threaded stem 9 screwed into a threaded hole of a bush 10 movable axially on the body of the sub munition in such a way that the striker member is brought from the said first to the said second position upon unscrewing of the stem from the threaded hole a pair of strip form flexible elements 19 are connected to the striker mem ber 3 , one end of which flexible elements 19 is fixed to the striker member 3 and each of which can be disposed, when the sub munition is expelled from the projectile, in a twisted configuration in such a way that the aerodynamic forces acting on them cause a moment to be transmitted to the striker member to unscrew this member itself from the associ ated threaded hole.
