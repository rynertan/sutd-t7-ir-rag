## Description
The present invention relates to a non catalytic method for reducing the concentration of NO in gas turbine combustion effluents by the injection of ammonia. More particularly, the invention relates to the injection of ammonia into an isothermal or cooling zone of a post combustion gas turbine apparatus where the combustion effluent is at a temperature of 1100 to 1500 K 827 to 1227 C . Combustion effluents and waste products from various installations are a major source of air pollution when discharged into the atmosphere. A particularly troublesome pollutant found in many combustion effluent streams is nitrogen oxide, designated as NO Heretofore, attempts at achieving NO Thermal de NO Thus US A 3900554 discloses that substantial NO In U.S. Air Force report AFAPL TR 72 80 entitled Fuel Modification for Abatement of Aircraft Turbine Engine Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions October, 1972 fuel additives including ammonia water and ammonia water methanol were used in aircraft turbine engines operating at gauge pressures of about 45 60 psig 310.3 to 413.7 kPa . The results reported showed only slight NO In a paper entitled Exxon Thermal DeNO Adding a considerable excess of ammonia to reduce the NO The limitation of thermal DeNO In the Proceedings of the American Flame Research Committee 1984 International Symposium on Alternative Fuels and Hazardous Wastes, P.C.T. de Boer developed an extended NO In addition, H₂O concentration in the flue gas plays a major role in the DeNO The analysis of model gas turbine systems to date has generally been based on laboratory DeNO Use of this kinetic model has led to the surprising discovery that at conditions normally existing at the exit of the combustor, significant DeNO Our co pending European patent application No. 84904275.9, published under International Publication No. WO 85 02130, describes and claims a non catalytic process for reducing the concentration of NO in a combustion effluent in which the combustion effluent contains NO and at least 0.1 volume percent oxygen and passes through at least one cooling zone at the upstream end of an isothermal zone, the process comprising adding ammonia to the combustion effluent while the temperature of the latter is in the range of from 975 K to 1600 K 702 C to 1327 C , cooling the mixture of combustion effluent and ammonia in the cooling zone at a rate of at least 50 K 50 C per second, the amount of ammonia which is added to the combustion effluent being sufficient to reduce the amount of NO in the combustion effluent leaving the cooling zone relative to the amount therein before the addition of ammonia, the amount of ammonia added to the combustion effluent, and the location at which the ammonia is added to the effluent, being determined by the solution of the set of simultaneous equations derived from the kinetic model of the following Table The combustion effluent is obtained, in particular, from stationary combustion equipment such as boilers, furnaces and incinerators, and WO 85 02130 does not mention combustion effluents derived from the operation of gas turbines. The present invention provides a process for reducing NO The process of the invention results in a a reduction of NO in the combustion effluent which is greater than that achieved by carrying out the process under substantially similar conditions but at atmospheric pressure. Water or steam may be added to cool the combustion effluent. The ammonia may be injected in an amount and at a location determined by the solution of a set of simultaneous equations derived from the kinetic model of Table I hereinafter.

Figures 3 and 4 are plots at about 1408 K 1135 C and about 1450 K 1177 C , respectively, indicating the percentage of NO Figures 5 and 6 are plots of the flue gas temperature vs. time from the point where ammonia is injected at about 1408 K 1135 C and about 1450 K 1177 C , respectively. As is well known, combustion in a gas turbine is effected in a section of the equipment commonly referred to as a combustor. Generally, this is accomplished by igniting a suitable fuel, in the presence of air, in one or more combustors simultaneously. The principal combustion products are carbon dioxide and steam. These products, along with the other combustion products, such as carbon monoxide and the various oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, combined with any excess oxygen and unconverted nitrogen, form what is referred to herein as a combustion effluent. The combustion effluent normally will contain 0.1 to 16 volume percent oxygen. The temperature of the combustion effluent typically is a maximum at or near the point of combustion and decreases axially along tie flow path and radially outwardly as the effluent moves along its flow path from the point of combustion until it is, ultimately, emitted to the atmosphere or otherwise loses its identity as a combustion effluent. The combustion effluent, passing through the combustion apparatus remains substantially isothermal in temperature after leaving the combustion zone in a gas turbine engine until it contacts the fan blade section, where it undergoes rapid cooling. The prior art suggests that the desired NO The amount of ammonia used herein ranges from 0.5 to 10 moles, preferably 1 to 3 moles of ammonia, per mole of NO As discussed more fully hereinafter the ammonia preferably is injected at the point at which the temperature is calculated to afford the greatest reduction in NO Although at temperatures in the range of 1100 1500 K 827 to 1227 C and short residence tiles it has been suggested that conventional non catalytic DeNO Because it is difficult to accurately simulate, on a laboratory scale, the temperature time history of combustion effluents as they pass through a gas turbine , i t is necessary to generate examples by means other than laboratory experiments. Complex chemical reactions occur by a series of elementary reaction steps, and if one knows the rate constants for such steps, a theoretical kinetic mechanism can be developed and verified through comparison with experimental data. An extensive block of kinetic data previously was developed by use of apparatus similar to the apparatus taught in US A 3,900,554 and used to determine which elementary reactions would likely be of significance during the reduction of NO by NH₃. For many of the reactions, the rate constants were well known, accurately measured constants of nature. For the remaining reactions, the rate constants were not accurately known and, accordingly, were taken as adjustable parameters, i.e. values for the unknown rate constants were assumed, the reaction kinetics to be expected from these rate constants were calculated and compared with the observed kinetics. Based on this comparison, a new set of rate constants were assumed, etc., until satisfactory agreement between calculation and experimentation were finally obtained. The rate constants for each reaction are set forth in Table I. These rate constants do not contain pressure related variables. The kinetic model hereof and respective rate constants were analyzed in a new approach by the inventor hereof from the standpoint of high pressure and short residence times for accurately predicting the conditions for the practice of the present invention. In the practice of the present invention the content of NO, O₂, and H₂O in the effluent stream to be treated is measured or estimated. These initial conditions, as well as measurements or estimates of temperatures in the range of 1100 K 827 K to 1500 K 1227 K at superatmospheric pressures are used in conjunction with the kinetic model hereof with appropriate software to determine the amount of ammonia and an injection point which will give the desired NO reduction. Appropriate software suitable for use herein would be any computer program designed for numerical integration of chemical rate expressions. A non limiting example of such software is CHEMKIN A General Purpose, Problem Independent, Transportable, Fortran Chemical Kinetics Code Package R. J. Kee, J. A. Miller, and T. H. Jefferson, an unlimited released Sandia National Laboratory Report SAND80 8003 1980 . This report is also available through the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce. The advantages of the kinetic computer model hereof are substantial in that it permits one skilled in the art to readily determine, by calculation, the embodiment of the present invention which will yield optimum results for the particular circumstances. In general, however, it may be said that the present invention is an improved method of noncatalytic reduction of NO with NH₃. The improvement of the present invention relates to the temperature, residence time and pressure at which the NH₃ is contacted with the NO containing combustion effluents. This contacting is done in the combustion zone at temperatures from 1100 K 827 C to 1500 K 1227 C , and where enough ammonia is present such that the volume ratio of ammonia to NO is in the range of 0.4 to 10. Generally, the ammonia can be injected up to 0.04 seconds upstream from a cooling zone, depending upon the combustion effluent temperature. The upper portion of the 1100 K 827 C to 1500 K 1227 C temperature range relates to higher initial NO concentrations, lower O₂ content of the combustion effluents, higher cooling rates and shorter delay times prior to cooling. To a somewhat lesser degree, the upper portion of the temperature range is also associated with higher H₂O content. As used here in the term contacting zone refers to that portion of the turbine in which the ammonia injected and the NO To illustrate the practice of the present invention and its advantages over the prior art the paper example below is presented. For illustration, a gas turbine engine is assumed with the following operating conditions, which can be considered normal for such engines An excess air level of 235 of stoichiometric air while firing a fuel gas of H to C mol ratio of 4.0. The boiler thus produces a flue gas containing 14.3 O₂, 3.03 CO₂, 6.06 H₂O and 76.64 N₂. There will also be traces of NO, the exact amount depending on the nitrogen content of the fuel and the manner in which the fuel is burned. For this example the NO level will be assumed to be 200 vppm, the pressure 13.6 atmospheres 1.37845 MPa , the residence time 0.005 seconds prior to cooling, and the time in the cooling zone 0.006 seconds. Further, it is assumed there will be a trace of the free radicals OH and O, the exact concentrations of these being determined by thermodynamic equilibrium and, therefore, being a function of temperature. Combustion flue gas would exit the combustors at a very high temperature and would be cooled with secondary air as it passes to the fan section. In this example it is assumed that the gas turbine has an isothermal zone between the last entry of dilution air in the combustor and the entry into the blade section wherein the temperature is approximately 1379 K 1106 C , the residence time of the flue gas within this cavity being 0.005 seconds, and the amount of ammonia injected is 400 vppm. The resulting NO By comparison, following the teachings of US A 3,900,554 and 4,115,515, at one atmosphere 0.101356 MPa , one would inject NH₃ as the flue gas enters the isothermal zone upstream of the blades. Assuming the amount of NH₃ injection, the amount of NO in the flue gas, and the time temperature relationship of the flue gas is the same as in the previous case, the resulting model calculations for NO In order to graphically illustrate this invention and the effects of pressure upon the calculated level of NO As shown in Tables II and III and in Figures 1 and 2, higher operating pressure produces the higher NO As previously noted, the amount of ammonia added is a function, in part, of the ammonia breakthrough, i.e., maximum amount of ammonia which is allowed to be present in the exhaust gas from the turbine. While generally there are no regulations governing the maximum ammonia content of the turbine exit gas, from an operations and regulatory standpoint it is preferred to maintain the NH₃ breakthrough below about 100 vppm, preferably in the 53 100 vppm range. Figures 3 and 4 disclose a series of calculations on percentage of NO Figure 3, utilizing calculations at an initial temperature of about 1408 K 1135 C , illustrates the percentage of NO In a similar manner, Figure 4 illustrates that if the ammonia breakthrough at 1450 K 1177 C were to be maintained at a maximum of 50 vppm at 1 atmosphere 0.101356 MPa would would require a NH₃ NO The pressure in a gas turbine typically will range between 10 atmospheres 1.01356 Mpa and 15 atmospheres 1.52035 MPa . The temperature will be a function of the specific type of turbine and the degree of loading. Typically, the maximum temperature in the turbine will range between 1350 K 1077 C and 1450 K 1177 C . From the plots in Figures 3 and 4, it can be seen that the addition of NH₃ at these conditions can reduce NO Since the actual NO In summary, from the examples presented herein it has been shown that significant NO reductions can be achieved through injecting NH₃ into gas turbine combustors at the proper location corresponding to an optimum gas temperature in the range of from 1100 1500 K 827 1227 C and elevated 10 15 atm., i.e., 1.01356 1.52035 MPa pressure. It also has been demonstrated that simultaneous injection of H₂O to achieve NO
