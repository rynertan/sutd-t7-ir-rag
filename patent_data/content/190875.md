# Heat sensitive recording paper.

## Abstract
A paper support comprising wood pulp, optionally containing a sizing agent and or other additives, is surface sized with a coating of a synthetic sizing agent to an amount of 0.01 2.0 g m² e.g. with a sizing bath, sizing press, gate roll coater, air knife coater or bar coater, to a Cobb water absorption defined by JIS P 8140 of 25 g m² or less, preferably 20 10 g m². The sized surface is coated with a conventional heat sensitive color forming layer including a binder, at a coverage of 3 15 g m² 0.2 1.0 g m² of color former by a conventional method, e.g. air knife coating and drying and machine calendering. Surface sizing agents include a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer, polyacrylamide, polyamidopolyurea, poly amidopolyamine epichlorhydrin, alkylketene dimer, epoxy lated fatty acid amide and a polyurethane, and particularly the product of adding epichlorhydrin to the reaction product of a fatty acid and a polyamine. The resultant recordirg paper has good contact with a thermal head and so gives high recording density and good dot reproduction, e.g. at a speed of 2 milli secs dot.
