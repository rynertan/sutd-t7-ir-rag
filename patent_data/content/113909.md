# Lightweight modular conveyer belt.

## Abstract
A conveyor belt composed of interconnected identical modules of integral plastic molded construction. Each of the modules includes a multiplicity of elongated parallel spaced link elements terminating in respective link ends and an inter mediate section between the link ends of grid like structure. The link ends each include a generally cylindrical projection which extends from one side of each of the link elements along the pivotal axis of the module. The projections extend from the same facing side of each link element. The modules are linked together with each module rotated 180 with respect to adja cent modules such that the projections of each adjacent mo dule extend in opposite directions. The flat sides of the linked ends of mated modules are in engagement to provide only a very small offset in the line of pull through the adjacent link ele ments to minimize bending forces in the links and link ends.
