# Tube expander and method.

## Abstract
A tube expander 10 for extrudably deforming tubes 12 into conformity with a flange 16 has a plurality of first and second forming members 28, 30 circumferen tially arranged an a mandrel 20 . In an initial position, the forming members 28, 30 are axially offset and radially retracted for ease of insertion into the bore 13 of the tube 12 . After insertion, the mandrel 20 is partially with drawn by an actuator and by such action, the forming members 28, 30 are brought together in an abutting, axially aligned, and radially expanded relationship such that workpiece contacting surfaces 40, 42 of the forming members 28, 30 are brought into substantially continuous circumferential contact with the tube bore 13 . The work piece contacting surfaces 40, 42 are maintained in conti nuous circumferential contact with the tube bore 13 as the forming members 28, 30 and the mandrel 20 are withdrawn from the tube end, thereby uniformly extruding the tube.
