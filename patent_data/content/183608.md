# SOFTWARE SECURITY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A security system is provided which provides security to selected software to prevent such software from being executed on an unauthorized computer system. The security system includes active electronic circuitry mounted within the connecting end of a standard computer cable and adapted for receiving a first predetermined information pattern from the host computer and for transmitting a second predetermined information pattern back to the host computer in response thereto. The second predetermined information pattern is compared to a validation pattern within the memory of the host computer and if a match occurs, execution of the software continues. If a match does not occur, execution of the software to be protected is terminated. The security system requires no modification of the hardware of the host computer and is user transparent.
