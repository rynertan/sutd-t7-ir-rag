# Pneumatic tire.

## Abstract
A pneumatic tire 10 comprising a pair of annular beads 12, 12 spaced from one another with a liner 20 extending between the tire beads. A reinforcement ply 24 and a barrier ply 26 are provided extending between the beads and a circumferentially inextensible belt assembly 28 is positioned in the crown region 30 of the tire. The reinforce ment ply has parallel cords 27 of aromatic polyamide material or cables of steel and the barrier ply is made from a material having a ply modulus of elasticity substantially less than that of the reinforcement ply The parallel cords or cables of the barrier ply preferably are at an angle α different than the angle β of the parallel cords or cables of the reinforcement ply.
