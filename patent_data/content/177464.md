# IMPROVEMENT IN SAFETY ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC CAPS FOR ELECTRIC BULBS

## Abstract
A safety electric and magnetic connection cap between a lampholder and an electric bulb, in which said lampholder is made up of an insulating block 10 having an upper disc 11 below which and in correspondence with proper holes the electric contact reeds 23,24 end, said reeds being con nected to the supply terminals. The bulb shows a base comprising a cylindrical sleeve 21 and a pin, or otherwise, according to a variant of this embodiment, two pins 25, 26 , which are connected to the terminals of the bulb filament and are designed to contact electrically the lampholder contact reeds. Interchageable magnetic means are provided on the lampholder as well as on the bulb base, said means cooperating with one another to realize the mechanical and the electric coupling between the lampholder and the bulb. The contact reeds of the lampholder are always in a safety position, which is out of the reach of fingers.
