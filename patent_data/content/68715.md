It will be appreciated that it is possible that any carboxyl blocking group present may be converted to another carboxylblocking group during the course of the reaction. The carboxyl group may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular R group, for example, acid and base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymically catalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. The compounds of the formulae XI and XI1 may be prepared by the methods of U.K. Patent ApplicationNumber 8118108, which is incorporated by reference.

The compounds of the formula IX are novel and as such from part of this invention. A salted ester of a compound of the formula I may be prepared by the reaction of the compound of the formula I with an esterifying agent.

Suitable esterifying reagents include reactive halides and their equivalents and alkyl oxonium salts. When a reagent such as a reactive iodide, chloride, tosylate, mesylate, bromide or equivalent is used, the resulting salt is generally suitable for use in a composition of this invention. Alternatively, the salt may be converted to an alternative salt, for example it is preferable to convert a tetrafluoroborate salt to an alternative salt, for example by passing a solution of one salt through a bed of anion exchange resin in the form of the desired salt, such as the chloride form. The salts may normally be obtained in solid form by dissolving in a fairly polar organic solvent such as ethanol or tetrahydrofuran and then precipitating using a less polar solvent such as diethyl ether or cyclohexane. The salted esters of the compounds of the formula I may normally be obtained in crystalline form by conventional methods such as trituration under or crystallisation or recrystallisation form a suitable organic solvent such as ether, acetone, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofuran. Salted esters of the compound of the formula I may also be prepared by reaction of an acid addition salt of the compound of the formula I with an alcohol in the presence of a condensation promoting agent. Suitable condensation promoting agents for use in this process include carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarboxiimide and the chemical equivalents thereof. The acid addition salt may be formed in situ or may be preformed. The acid employed will normally be a strong acid such as a methane sulphonic acid, p toluene sulphonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction is normally carried out in an inert organic solvent. When the ester being formed is that of a liquid alcohol it is convenient to use that alcohol as the solvent or as part of the solvent system, The esterification is generally performed at a non extreme temperature such as Oo to 350C, for example from about 100 to 250C. Conveniently the reaction may be performed at ambient temperature. The following Examples illustrates the invention.

EXAMPLE 2 9 N Benzyl N aminomethylene ammonio 9 deoxyclavulanate EMI29.1 A suspension of 9 N benzylamino 9 deoxyclavulanic acid 1.0 g, 3.5 mmol in dry CH2C12 25 ml was stirred at Oo and treated with DBN 0.5 g, 4.0 mmol followed by ethyl formimidate hydrochloride 0.39 g, 3.5 mmol and the resulting solution refluxed for 18 hrs. The solvent was evaporated and the residue chromatographed on silica gel.

Example 3 9 N isobutyl N Cdimethylaminomethylene ammonio3 9 deoxyclavulanateEMI30.1 Solid triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate 9OOmg was dissolved in dry dimethylformamide lOml and the solution kept 24 hours at room temperature. 9 Isobutylamino 9 deoxyclavulanate 800mg was suspended in dry dimethylformamide 8ml , the mixture cooled in an ice bath and treated with DBN 0.59 ml .When a complete solution had been obtained, the above mentioned solution containing N,N dimethyl N ethoxymethylene ammonium fluoroborate was added dropwise.The resulting solution was stirred for 4 hours at 5 200C, stored overnight in a fridge, treated with water 1 ml and evaporated reduced pressure, water bath at 300C almost to dryness. The residue was chromatographed on silica, eluting with n butanol ethanol water 1.5 1 1 . Fractions containing the most polar major ss lactam containing product were combined and evaporated at reduced pressure to near dryness. The chromatographic procedure was then repeated and appropriate fractions evaporated as before. The residue was dissolved in water 20 ml and the solutions evaporated at reduced pressure to near dryness. AR acetone 20 ml was then added to the residue and evaporated at reduced pressure.This last procedure was repeated about 6 times until a foam remained. The residue was desiccated overP205 to provide 9 N isobutyl N dimethylaminomethylene ammonio 9 deoxyclavulanate 0.41g as a pale yellow, hygroscopic foam. 3 max Br 1785, 1680 and 1620cm 1 g D20 HOD 4.615 0.84 6H, d, J 7Hz , 1.7 2.4 1H, m , 2.9 3.4 9H, m , 3.55 1H, dd, J 17 and 2.5Hz , 4.21 2H, d, J 7.5Hz , 4.79 1H, t, J 7.5Hz , 4.92 1H, s , 5.71 1H, d, J 2.5Hz , 7.57 1H, s hmax HZO 222nm e 12070 .
