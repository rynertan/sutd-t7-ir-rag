# A ROLL FILM AND A PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERA FOR USE THEREWITH

## Abstract
A roll film for a still camera, the film having a leader 14 provided with an aperture 46 that includes a flexible tongue element 50 extending into the aperture 46 . The still camera 18 for use with said roll film includes a rotatable film take up spool 42 having at least one film capturing member 44 mounted thereon. Each capturing member 44 comprises a pin 58 for entering the aperture 46 in the leader 14 . Said pin 58 can be formed in a variety of shapes provided that such shape is larger than the film leader aperture 46 when the aperture tongue element 50 is unflexed but smaller than the film leader aperture 46 when the tongue element 50 is flexed. Due to such structure a camer 18 of simple design can be provided, with the roll film being reliably coupled to the camera take up spool 42 for winding and easily released towards the end of the rewinding operation.
