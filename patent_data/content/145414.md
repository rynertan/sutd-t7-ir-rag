# Ion exchange resin intrusion monitor.

## Abstract
A monitor 18 in Fig. 2 for detecting the presence of particles in an effluent fluid, which particles emit fluorescent light upon irradiation. As used to monitor ion exchange resin fines in effluent liquid in a steam power plant, there is a probe arrangement 26, 30 in Fig. 2 26 min 56 in Fig. 3 56 in Fig. 4 to inject fluorescence stimulating light into a volume 46 in Fig. 2 of the effluent liquid. A detector arrangement 30, 32, 34, 36 in Fig. 2 56, 32 min , 72, 74, 76 in Fig. 3 is disposed to receive emitted fluorescent light from any particles in the effluent, and an arrangement 40, 44 in Fig. 2 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 82, 80, 78, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98, 100, 102, 104, 106 in Fig. 3 actuatable by said detector arrangement 30, 32, 34, 36 in Fig. 2 56, 32 min , 72, 74, 76 in Fig. 3 for generating a signal to indicate the presence of particles in the effluent.
