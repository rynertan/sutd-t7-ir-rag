# A DEVICE CONCERNING A WIND PROOF, WATER REPELLENT PANEL OPEN TO DIFFUSION

## Abstract
A windproof, water repellent panel 1 open to diffusion, preferably in doubled solid cardboard for building purposes. By means of folding directions 4 , the panel has been divided into a number of parallel squares 5 and folded with the flat sides of the squares laid against each other into a long, relatively rigid unit 7 . Preferably, the squares are folded in a zig zag fashion, and the folding is made so deep that the panel is flat or approximately flat when hanging attached by its upper edge. To facilitate assembly, the two outer squares 5 may be provided with a hole 8 in the middle of the length and near their free longitudinal edge, so that the panels may be hung on inserted nails attached to the top sleeper above alternate poles. For use as a distance element in insulated roofs, the panel may be provided with folding directions 14, 15 across the first folding directions 4 , near the opposite side edges of the panel 2 .
