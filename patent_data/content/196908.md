A drive apparatus for auxiliary equipment of a motor has a planetary cone reduction gear 11 housed within a pulley 4 which belt drives auxiliary equipment. The drive apparatus is mounted on a stationary portion 8 of the motor by a fastener 9 which secures a stationary plate 5 of the apparatus to the stationary portion of the motor. A shock absorbing member 30, 31 is provided between the fastener and the stationary plate to absorb vibrations of the apparatus during operation and to compensate for dimensional inaccuracies, preventing stresses when the apparatus is mounted on the motor.
