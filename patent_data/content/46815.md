## Description
DESCRIPTION CONTINUOUS SPIN DRAW POLYESTER PROCESS This invention relates to the simultaneous coupled spin drawing of continuous filament synthetic fibers from ind ustrial polyester polymer. More particularly, it relates to an improved process for the production of low shrinkage, continuous polyester fibers which are particularly useful in the preparation of industrial products, including industrial belts, conveyor belts, and reinforced elastomevic structures.Still more particularly, it relates to a continuousprocess for the production of low shrinkage continuous polyester fibers by melt spinning the polymer followed immediately by drawing the spun fibers wherein the spun fibers are heated substantially immediately above their second order transition. temperature by being passed through a steam impinging draw point localizing jet at a steam temperature of 460 C to 5800C. Yarn thermal shrinkage is reduced and yarn dimensional stability improved with no adverse yarn property changes such as lower strength or higher elongation at break. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART There are several prior art processes for reducing thermal shrinkage of polyester yarns however, this reduction in polyester yarn thermal shrinkage normally can be achieved only by sacrificing strength or mechanical quality, increasing ultimate elongation or elongation at break, or by the expensive alterna tive of a separate operation following drawing, such as annealing or some other form of heat treatment. It is therefore desirable to have a continuous process which reduces yarn shrinkage without any of the aforementioned disadvantages. In this regard, several processes are known which involve conditions of continuously spinning and drawing filaments. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an improved process for the simultaneous spin drawing of one or more ends of multifilament, continuous filament, synthetic polyester i.dustrial fiber wherein the improvement comprises localizing the draw point of the fiber through use of a nonondensing steam jet at a steam temperature of about 4600C. to 5800C. so that a reduced shrinkage industrial fiber is produced. The present invention also relates to an improved process for the simultaneous spin drawing of one or more ends of synthetic fibers from an industrial polyester polymer whereby a reduced shrinkage industrial fiber is produced. The process, which includes the steps of supplying a melt of the polymer to a spinning unit, extruding the molten polymer through a spinnerette having a plurality of extrusion orifices into a gaseous medium, cooling the extruded polymer filaments, lubricating the filaments, heating the filaments substantially immediately above their second order transitiontemperature, drawing and then winding up the filaments, is improved by passing the filaments through a steam impinging draw point localizing jet at a temperature of about 4820C. to 5800C. to thereby heat the filaments substantially immediately above their second order transition temperature. The percent thermal shrink is reduced without significant effect on other yarn properties. The present invention further relates to a process for the simultaneous spin drawing of one or more ends of multifilament, continuous filament, synthetic polyester industrial fiber. This process, in addition to reducing percent thermal shrink, produces a dimensionally stable polyester industrial fiber. The process.comprises the steps of a supplying a melt of polyester polymer to a spinning unit b extruding the melt through a spinnerette having a plurality of extrusion orifices to form filaments c advancing the extruded filaments through a substantially stationary column of air contained in a heated sleeve having a temperature of about 2000C. to 3500C. d advancing the filaments through a quenching zone e lubricating the filaments f passing the lubricated filaments over a forwarding roll system maintained at a temperature of less than 50 C. g subsequently passing the filaments through a steam impinging draw point localizing jet at a steam temperature of about 482 C. to 580 C. to heat the filaments substantially immediately above their second order transition temperature h passing the filaments over a pair of draw rolls wherein at least one of the draw rolls is maintained at a temperature of between about 1900C. and 2370C. i passing the filaments over a relax roll system maintained at a temperature of about 600C. to 1350C., yarn tension to the relax roll system being maintained at about 0.4 to 2.0 grams per denier and j winding up the filaments at a tension.of from about 0.06 to 0.6 gram per denier. It is preferred that the melt have an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.68 to 0.96, most preferably of about 0.68 to 0.78 and that it be supplied at a temperature of about 2720C. to 3100C. It is also pre ferred that the steam temperature for localizing the draw point of the fiber be about.5100C. to 5800C. Throughout the present specification and claims, the intrinsic viscosity of the polyester melt is given as a measure for the mean molecular weight, which is determined by standard procedures wherein the concentration of the measuring solution amounts to 0.5 g. 100 mL, the solvent is a รณ0 percent phenol 40 percent tetrachloroethane mixture, and the measuring temperature is 250C. The tenacity or breaking strength in grams per denier UTS is defined by ASTM Standards, Part 24,American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 RaceStreet, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, page 33 1965 , as the maximum resultant internal force that resists rupture in a tension test, or breaking load or force, expressed in units of weight required to break or rupture a specimen in a tensile test made according to specified standard procedures. By 8 U. Ew is meant elongation at break in percent. The term shrinkage is defined as percent decrease in length of a material when exposed to elevated temperatures for a specified period of time and under 0.05 g.p.d. tension. In the present invention the percent thermal shrinkage T.S. is measured between two metal plates maintained at 177 C. for a time period of 60 seconds. The term modulus in grams per denier, also known as tensile modulus Young s Modulus , is expressed as the ratio of change in stress to change in strain in the initial straight line portion of the stress strain curve extrapolated to 100 percent elongation. The term toughness , also known as toughness index, is defined above reference as the actual work per unit volume or per unit mass of material which is required to rupture the material. It is proportional to the area under the load elongation curve from the origin to the breaking point. The toughness index is routinely measured in grams centimeter per denier centimeter. In measuring yarn quality, the echancal , quality rating is made by visual examination of a stationary package wherein a rating of 1 to 3 to assigned with 1 being excellent and 3 being substandard.A strobe examination is made by flashing a strobe a rotating package wherein the strobe frequency is identito the RPMs of the package and wherein a visual rating of 1 to 4 is assigned with 1 being excellent and 4 being unacceptable. The preferred polyesters are the linear terephthalate polyesters, i.e ., polyesters of a glycol containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and a dicarboxylic acid component containing at least about 75 percent terephthalic acid. The remainder, if any, of the dicarboxylic acid component may be any suitable dicarboxylic acid such as sebacic acid, adipic acid, isophthalic acid, sulfonyl 4,4 dibenzoic acid, or 2,8 di benzofuran dicarboxylic acid.The glycols may containSmore than two carbons atoms in the chain, e.g., diethylene glycol, butylene glycol, decamethylene glycol, and bis l,4 hydorxymethyl cyclohexane. Examples of linear terephthalate polyesters which may be employed include poly ethylene terephthalate , poly ethylene terephthalate 5 chloroisophthalate 85 15 , poly ethylene tere phthalate 5 lsodium sulfo3 isophthalate 97 3 , poly cyclohexane 1,4 dimethylene terephthalate , and poly cyclohexane 1,4 dimethylene terephthalate hexahydroterephthalate 75 25 . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure is a schematic front view of the apparatus used for the method of this invention, and Figure 2 is a schematic of the draw panel designated by the numeral 21 in Figure 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT It has now been found that reduced shrinkage industrial fiber can be melt spun continuously from a polyester polymer, e.g., polyethylene terephthalate, and that this fiber can be continuously drawn without the intermediate step of winding up. These results are achieved in accordance with this invention by increasing the steam drawing temperature to enhance crystalline development, thereby enabling economic one step coupled production of fibers with improved dimensional stability the sum of U.E. T.S. and higher strength U.T.S. . By one step production is meant that there is no winding up step between the melt spinning and drawing steps, and there is no need for a separate operation or step such as annealing, carried out subsequent to the simultaneous spin drawing process. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, like numbers indicate like apparatus. Molten polymer is fed by extruder 11 to spin pump 12 which feeds spin block 13 containing a conventional spin pot, now shown including a spinnerette and a spinning filter disposed between the spin pump and spinnerette. The spinnerette may be designed for the extrusion of one or more ends of filaments. Figure 1 illustrates the simultaneous extrusion of two ends 14 and 15 of multifilament, continuous filament yarn from one spinnerette.Ends 14 and 15 are extruded from the spinneette at a rate of 35 to 75 pounds 15 to 34 kg per hour per end, and are passed downwardly from the spinnerette into a substantially stationary column of air contained in a heated sleeve 16 of conventional height, most preferably about 15 inches 38.1 cm . The extrusion rate, of course, will differ depending on the denier and number of ends of yarn being extruded. For instance, a single continuous end of 1000 denier would be extruded from the spinnerette at a rate of about 35 to 50 pounds 15 to 23 kg per hour, most preferably 40 pounds 18 kg per hour, white three continuous ends would be extruded from the spinnerette at a rate of about 90 to 150 pounds 40 to 68 kg per hour, most preferably at a rate of 120 pounds 55 kg per hour.Yarn leaving heated sleeve 16 is passed directly into the top of the quench chamber of conventional quenching apparatus 17. The quench chamber is an elongated chimney of conventional length, preferably from 60 to 80 inches 1.5 to 2.0 m . Ends 14 and 15 of yarn are lubricated by finish applicator 18 and then the ends are separated and the filaments in each end converged by guides 19. A conventional spinning finish composition is used to lubricate the filaments. Finish applicator 18 is depicted as a lube roll which may be rotated either with or against the direction of the yarn movement it is preferred that the lube roll rotate with the direction of yarn movement. Rotation of the lube roll is at a rate of about 1.5 to 5 revolutions per minute, typically 3.1 revolutions per minute, for a lube roll having a diameter of about 3 to 8 inches 7.62 to 20.3 cm , typically 6 inches 15.2 cm .It is preferred that the filaments be coated with from about 0.2 to about 1.0 weight percent based on. the weight of the yarn of the finish most preferably 0.5 percent. Ends 14 and 15 are then transported via interfloor tube and aspirator 20 to spin draw panel 21 see Figure 2 where they are fed to wrap around pretension roll 23 and accompanying separator roll 23a and then feed roll 24 and accompanying separator roll 24a. From feed roll 24, the ends are then passed through conventional steam impinging draw poing localizing jet 25, supplying steam at a temperature of about 4600C. to 5800C., and at a pressure of about 75 to 125 psig 600 to 960 kPa absolute , and then. to a pair of draw rolls 26 and 26a.The ends pass from draw rolls 26 and 26a to relax roll 27 and accompanying separator roll 27a. The yarn ends then pass through a conventional air operated inter lacing jet 28 and are taken up by winder 22. With respect to the temperatures at which draw rolls 26 and 26a are maintained, the ultimate objective is to obtain a yarn temperature of about 1900C. to 220 C. for a given yarn residence time of about 0.25 to 0.5 second, most preferably about 0.4 second. It is believed that the best mode of achieving this objective is by maintaining both of draw rolls 26 and 26a at a temperature of about 2250C. to 2300C.This, however, should not be construed as discounting other acceptable draw roll temperatures such as dual rolls at a temperature of about 1900C, to 215C. or a single roll, preferably roll 26a, at about 2250C to 200C. In any event, it has been found that at draw roll temperatures of greater than 2370C. the yarn starts sticking to the rolls, and at draw roll temperaturej of less than 190at., there is an undesirable increase in U.E. T.S. Relax roll 27 is maintained at the minimum temperature necessary to maintain temperature equilibrium during processing, preferably 600C. to 1200C. In order to demonstrate the invention, the following examples are given. They are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention, which is defined by the amended claims. In these examples parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLE 1 A melt of polyethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity o about 0.87 to 0.96 was supplied at a rate of 37.5 pounds 17 kg per hour per end and at a temperature of about 3000cm to the apparatus shown inFigures 1 and 2. The molten polymer was fed by extruder 11 to spin pump 12 which fed spin block 13 containing a conventional spin pot as shown in Figure 1 of U.S.Patent 4,072,457 to Cooksey et al., hereby incorporated by reference. The pressure drop through the filter assembly of the spin pot averaged 200 to 400 atmospheres 20,000 to 40,000 kPa absolute . A split spinnerette designed for the simultaneous extrusion of two multifilament ends of 192 filaments each was utilized, the spinnerette orifices having a diameter of about 0.021 inch 0.05 cm and being spaced so that the distance between the filaments formed per end was about 0.28 to 0.40 inch 0.71 to 1 0 cm immediately below the spinnerette. The two ends 14 and 15 of multifilament, continuous filament yarn passed downwardly from the spinnerette into a substantially stationary column of air contained in a heated sleeve 16, about 15 inches 38.1 cm in height, the temperature of the sleeve itself being maintained at about 4000C. Yarn leaving heated sleeve 16 was passed directly into the top of the quench chamber of quenching apparatus 17. Quenching apparatus 17 was as shown in Figure 1C of U.S. Patent 3,999,910 to Pendlebury et al., hereby incorporated by reference. Quenching air at about 650F. about 18.33C. and 60 percent relative humidity was supplied at about 400 SCFM 1.9 M3 sec. to cross flow quench the filaments as they descended through the quench chamber, which had a length o about 68.5 inches 1.7 m. .The ends 14 and 15 of yarn were lubricated by finish applicator 18 and then separated and converged by guides 19. The spin finish applied consisted of 15 parts of a stearic acid ester of a mixture of secondary alcoholshaving the general structureEMI9.1 where n is 5 to 6, 15 parts refined coconut oil, 13 parts of ethoxylated lauryl alcohol, 2 parts of dinonyl sodium sulfosuccinate, 5 parts ethoxylated tallow amine, 10 parts of sodium salt of alkylarylsulfonate, and 40 parts mineral oil having a boiling range between 510OF. and 6200F. about 2660C. and 3270C. see U.S. Patents 4,103,068 and 4,105,568 to Marshall et al., hereby incorporated by reference . About 0.5 weight percent of the finish composition was applied to the yarn based on the weight of the yarn. The ends were then trans ported via interfloor tube and aspirator 20 to the spin draw panel 21 where they were fed to wrap around a pretension roll 23 and accompanying separator roll 23a and then to feed roll 24 and accompanying separator roll 24a rotating at a speed of about 456 meters per minute.Both sets of rolls were at a temperature of less than 500C., and the tension between pretension 23 and feed 24 rolls was about 0.03 gram per denier. From feed roll 24, the ends were then passed through conventional steam impinging draw point localizing jet 25, supplying steam at a temperature of 290 C. and at a pressure of 100 psig. 790 kPa absolute and then to a pair of draw rolls 26 and 26a, rotating at 2,645 meters per minute.Draw roll 26a was maintained at about 1300C to 1400C.The draw ratio was about 5.80 to 1. Yarn tension was maintained at about 0.4 gram per denier as the ends passed from draw roll 26 to relax roll 27 and accompanying separator roll 27a, the relax roll 27 being heated to 1400C. and rotating at 2,592 meters per minute. The yarn ends then passed through a conventional air operated interlacing jet 28 and were taken up by a winder 22 at a tension of from about 0.10 to 0.13 gram per denier. Table I below sets forth the physical properties and quality of the yarn so produced. EXAMPLES 2 8 Yarn was produced in accordance with the process of Example 1, varying only the temperature of steam in the draw point localizing jet 25 for each ofExamples 2 8. Physical properties and quality of the yarn so produced are set forth in Table I. TABLE I Yarn Physicals DPL Steam U.T.S. U.E. T.S. U.E. Example Tmp. 0C.

Further, the 290 C. temperature of Example 1 was set as the lower limit for evaluation as the yarn kept breaking out and could not be strung up at draw point localizing steam temperatures below 290at. It can be seen that U.E. T.S. dropped at every draw point localizing steam temperature increase there appears to be approximately an inverse straight line relationship such that each 10 C. rise in draw point localizing steam temperature results in about an 0.18 to 0.20 percent reduction in 8 U.E. T.S.The T.S. is clearly reduced at each increase in draw point localizing steam temperature and shows an inverse straight line relationship with draw point localizing steam temperature between 3600C. and 5200C. where each 100C, rise in draw point localizing steam temperature causes a 0.23 percent reduction in T.S. As draw point localizing steam temperature was increased, denier was slowly reduced, which indicates that less relaxing and shrinkage was occurring on the relax rolls. This would normally be expected to increase T.S. however, T.S. was decreased, possibly indicating that the yarn was partially annealed at these high temeratures or the crystallinity was increased. EXAMPLE 9 Yarn was produced in accordance with the process of Example 1 with the following variations. The melt was supplied at a temperature of about 282 C. Heated sleeve 16 was maintained at a temperature of about 3000C. Draw point localizing jet 25 was supplied with steam at a temperature of about 5500C. and at a pressure of 110 psig 860 kPa absolute . Draw roll 26a was maintained at a temperature of about 230 C., and relax roll 27 was maintained at a temperature of about 12DOC. The tension between pretension 23 and feed 24 rolls was increased to 500 grams 0.08 gram per denier .Yarn tension was increased to about 1.0 gram per denier as the ends passed to relax roll 27, and winder 22 tension was increased to about 0.2 gram per denier. The draw ratio was approximately 5.9. Table II below sets forth the physical properties and quality of the yarn so produced. TABLE II Yarn Physicals Yarn QualityExam U.T.S. U.E. T.S. U.E.

T.S. primarily through a T.S. reduction, the other parameters variations of Example 9 reduce U.E. T.S. principally by reduc ing U.E. EXAMPLE 10 Yarn was produced in accordance with the pro cess of Example 1 with the following variations. The melt had an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.68 to 0.78 and was supplied at a temperature of about 283 C. Draw point localizing jet 25 supplied steam at a temperature of about 425 C. to 4300C. Table III below sets forth the physical properties of yarn so produced. EXAMPLE 11 Yarn was produced in accordance with the pro cess of Example 1 with the following variations. The melt had an intrinsic viscosity of about 0.68 to 0.78 and was supplied at a temperature of about 2750C. Heated sleeve 16 was maintained at a temperature of about 250 C. Draw point localizing jet 25 was supplied with steam at a temperature of about 550 C. and at a pressure of 110 psig 860 kPa, absolute . The draw ratio was 6.2 to 1. Draw roll 26a was maintained at a temperature of about 2250C. to 2300C. Relax roll 27 was maintained at a temperature of about 1150C. while yarn tension to relax roll 27 was maintained at about 0.9 to l O gram per denier. Yarn ends were taken up by winder 22 at a tension of from about 0.06 to 0.6 gram per denier, typically 0.2 gram per denier. Table III below sets forth the physical properties of the yarn so produced. EXAMPLE 12 Yarn was produced in accordance with the process of Example 11, except that the temperature of steam in the draw point localizing jet 25 was 580 C. Physical properties of the yarn so produced are set forth inTable III below. Note, in order to optimize process performance and product quality, the draw point localizing jet steam pressure was reduced to 100 psig 790 kPa absolute at 5800C Above 5800C., yarn equality and process performance were unacceptable.
