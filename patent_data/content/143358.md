## Description
A REGULATING METHOD AND EQUIPMENT F R ITS REtISACION The subject of the invention is a method of regulation for governing electrical heating eq3fpment in relation with the heating of room space. A further subject of the invention is equipment for the realisation of the method It is intended that the electrical heating equipment in connection with this application mainly consists of electrical heating equipment located in the room space in direct association with the room air, essentially wall mounted heating radiators or simmilar equipment. There are several adverse features in the regulation methods for electrical heating equipment and in the heating equipment itself which are in use today which detract the use of electrical heating equipment. In particular the convential control by thermostat, in which full heating effect is led to the heating device until the thermostat cuts off the power supplyt causes a relatively high rise in surface temperature during the heating period, and, if the the thermostat is covered, can even constitute a fire hazard. In addition the thermostat which is sited with the heating device commonly functions on the basis of a bimetallic cutout and the temperature observed in the vicinity of the heating device and not upon the temperature prevailing in the room space to be heated.Furthermore the bimetal cutouts used make audible sounds when the heating equipment is switched on and also when it is switched off and this cause audible disturbance and uncertainty to the user of the equipment.Further still, the operation of the bimetallic thermostat causes interference in the operation of certain telecommunications equipment such as radio receivers, televisions and so on. In addition to this the bimetallic cutout in the thermostat does not keep to its setting in the passage of time, the cutoff temperature changes which means that it hunts on the measuring scale and the user of the equipment must take this into account by carrying out calibration from time to time with the aid of room temperature measurements. The purpose of the invention put forward is to eradicate the disadvantges described above and to bring about a new method of regulation and equipment, primarily for governing room orientated electrical heating equipment, in order that the aforementioned detrimental effects do not occur. The facts characteristic to the invention are referred to in the Patent Claims section. The regulation method and equipment according to the in Invention is based on the regulation of the heating equipment surface temperature so that the surface temperature is kept as low as possible relative to the heating effect required. Further, in accordance with the invention, the surface temperature of the heating equipment is not allowed to rise above the allowed and set maximum value. Furthermore, according to one application of the invention, when the speed of change in room temperature exceeds a certain value, for example as the result of momentary ventilation, the surface temperature is fundamentally held constant for a certain periodandthe heating effect of the heating equipmentis only regulated according to the changed room temperature after the period referred to. A merit of the invention is that the surface temperature of the heating equipment always remains sufficiently low and in every circumstance at a safe level. Overheating of tbe heating equipment cannot occur and nor does the electrical equipment lead to fire hazard the surface temperature of the heating equip ment is also at a pleasant level from the point of view of the user. Further, in utilising the electronic microprocessor measuring and control system in the heating equipment the regulation is precise and permanent because the regulation is based on the actual temperature prevailing in the room space. The invention is explained in detail in the following with the aid of performance examples and referring to the accompanying drawings in which Figs 1 2 present in diagammatic form various regulation methods and equipments according to the invention and Figs 3 4 present the regulation circumstances and events and the performance of regulation at various temperature conditions in accordance with room temperature and temperature setting. In Fig. 1 the regulation method and ectuipmtan in aecocd ance with the invention for electrical heating device 1 can be seen, as for the regulation of a heating radiator mounted to a room space wall. According to the invention the heating device 1 is furnished with a governing device 4 in order to regulate the heating effect of the heating device. The regulating equipment includes the surface temperature sensor 2 located on the surface of heating device 1 the temperature sensor 3 arranged to measure the temperature of the room space and the governing device 4 such as the microprocessor with its room temperature setting device 5.The sensor 3 measuring the room temperature is located to advantage fundamentally in a separate position from the heating device 1 so that it measures particularly the actual room temperature. In Fig. 3 the operation of the regulating method according to the invention is presented graphically the vertical axis represents temperature and the horizontal axis time. The straight lineTa represents the desired setting value for room temperature, equivalent to the temperature setting value , for example 210C, at the setting device 5 of the equipment in Fig. 1. The curve Th depicts the actual value of the room temperature as measured by the room temperature sensor 3 in accordance with Fig. 1. The curveT depicts the actual surface temperature of the heating device 1 p which is measured with the surface temperature sensor 2 in the equipment according to Fig. 1. The stepped line Tas depicts the setting value of the equipment surface temperature and also the heating effect P. According to the invention the heating effect P of the heating device 1 is governed according to the room temperature Th and time t so that when Th falls below the room temperature setting value Ta cycle 0 tk the surface temperature T is raised to p a known extent aT for a known time period out that is a corres p ponding extra heating effect is supplied to the heating device. Correspondingly when the room temperature Th exceeds the room temperature setting value Ta the surface temperature T of the p heating device is reduced to a known extent atop for a known time perion4t, for example in Fig. 3 for a time cycle tk tl. Thus the desired setting value Ta is attained with as low a surface temperature as possible and with small changes in surface temperature. In the regulation method according to the invention in Fig. 3. the control of the effect of the heater is thus performed on the basis of the surface temperature T which is governed p according to the governing device 4 that is in accordance with the internal temperature setting Tas calculated by computer.When the surface temperature Tp exceeds the setting Tas the power is cut off the descending stages of the steps in the figure when it falls below the setting the power is reconnected rising steps . Then T and thus also Th follow the setting Tas p bottom part of the figure . When regulation is carried out on a time basis changes are begun from a known surface temperature Tp for example 400C. The surface temperature Tp of the heater is set with the ON OFF control to this value. If after a certain period of time at the room temperature Th is lower than the room temp erature setting Tat the surface temperature setting Tas is in as creased Tp , but however so that the maximum setting T TpmaX for example 800C,is not exceeded.If after the stated timeat the room temperature Th is higher than the room temperature setting Ta the surface temperature setting Tas is lowered, but not however lower than the room temperature setting Ta The time period 4t can be regulated correspondingly with the room in question by measuring the time between tk tl of the surface temperature Tas maximum and minimum values, when it is some factor oft if out is sufficiently short. A measured time is is set for the cycleat of the room in question or some part of its whole value. A rapid change in room temperature is an abnormal phenomenon and is eliminated according to the invention by measuring the speed of change z Th t. If it is greater than the known limiting value 0 Th t max. the surface temperature setting T as is kept essentially constant for a known periodAt1, and only after this is regulation of the surface temperature setting begun if required. This is illustrated graphically in Fig. 4. The room temperature change speedTh t measured as time cycle iktl is greater than the the known limiting valuedmTh tmax. Then during a corresponding time the surface temperature settingTas is kept constant and after the room temperature has returned to a normal level after the time perioduStl it is returmed to normal regulation. If the difference between temperature Th and setting valueTa exceeds a known value ATmax. and the change mentioned is not too rapid , aTJ,t is smaller than Th t max. normal regulation is overridden and it is transformed to maximum egul2t on, that is the surface temperature is st to maximum, Fig. 4, cycle,St2 or minimum,room temperature setting. After this upon the room temperature Th changing a known temperaturebl, for example 1OC above the setting value Ta, it is returned to normal regulation operation by allocating the surface temperature setting for example a starting value such as 400C.The device then observes a longer term change in room temperature, for example upon a ventilating window being left open, and adapts the effectiveness of the heating device to correspond to the new circumstance. The heating effect of the heating equipment is regulated by governing the number of alternating current halfwaves 6 fed to the heating equipment,by means of the regulator 4. The aforementioned halfwaves are passed into the equipment for known time periods,for example from fractions of a second to several seconds, and the halfwaves cut for known time periods, for example fractions of a second to several seconds. The regulation of the surface temperature is then performed by means of ON OFF regulation and the setting of the internal surface temperature Tas fundamentally corresponds to the heating effect P in accordance with Fig. 4. In Fig. 2 the equipment also includes another heating device 7 with its surface temperature sensor 8. The governing device 4 with its setting facility 5 of the previous heating equipment 1 is arranged to control the second heating equipment 7 surface temperature Tpin the manner described above. In Figs 1 2 the temperature sensors 3 monitor the room temperature and are essentially located separate from the heating equipment 1 so that they measure the actual temperature of the room without any kind of interference. Naturally temperature sensors 3 may also be located in association with the heating equipment or in its immediate vicinity in the convential manner as long as it is ensured that the heating equipment does not interfere with the measurement of the room temperature or that interference caused by the heating equipment is compensated for. The performance examples are intended for the illustration of the invention without limitation in any respect. The invention can thus be modified within the limits of the accompanying PatentClaims.
