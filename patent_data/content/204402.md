# Electrochemical system with rotating electrode sparger.

## Abstract
An electrochemical system for determining the concen tration of a bacteria or other enrymatic agents in a liquid sample 14 . The system includes mounting means 20 for mounting an electrode assembly 16 , and drive means for rotating the electrode assembly. The electrode assembly comprises a shaft 22 having a longitudinal axis and a longi tudinally extending interior passage 40 , an electrode 24 mounted at the lower end of the shaft, and sparging means 26 extending laterally from the lower end of the shaft. The sparging means is in communication with passage 40 through openings 50 . The electrode and sparging means are mounted such that they are immersed in the sample when the shaft is mounted by the mounting means. The electrode assembly further comprises conductor means 44, 46 for electrically connecting the electrode to the electrochemical system. The electrode assembly is rotated during measure ment of the concentration of the enzymatic agent. Prior to such measurement, dissolved oxygen may be rapidly re moved from the sample by rotating the electrode assembly and introducing an inert gas into the passage, such that the inert gas passes from the rotating sparging means into the sample.
