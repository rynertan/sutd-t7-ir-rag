# Brake pedal linkage assembly.

## Abstract
A brake pedal linkage includes a pair of levers 18, 20 , a first connecting member 26 and a second connecting member 28 . The first connecting member defines a lost motion connection 32, 34 with a master cylinder 12, 16 and the second connecting member 28 defines a lost motion connection 38, 40 with one 18 of the pair of levers 18, 20 . The first connecting member 26 extends between a brake pedal 14 and a master cylinder 16 and cooperates with the pair of levers such that the master cylinder travel is greater than the brake pedal during an initial stage of braking, less than the brake pedal during an intermediate stage of braking, and equal to the brake pedal during a final stage of braking.
