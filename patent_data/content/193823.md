# Rubber compounding bags and film made from syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene.

## Abstract
Bales of unvulcanized rubber, vulcanized rubber or com pounding ingredients for unvulcanized rubber are packaged in film or bags made from syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene 1,2 SBD containing at least one antiblock agent additive and at least one slip agent additive. Coextrusion can be used to manufacture bags or film having two or more layers where only the inside layer is heavily loaded with antiblock additives and the outside layer contains only a minimal amount of antiblock additives with both layers containing slip agents. The use of 1,2 SBD serves to eliminate the problems of incompatibility and disposal encountered in the prior art and provides film and bags having superior puncture and tear resistance when com pared to a conventional material such as polyethylene.
