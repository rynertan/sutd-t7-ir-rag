# Solenoid operated valves.

## Abstract
An hydraulic control valve and particularly such a valve for use as an automotive brake pressure modulation valve to maintain optimum adhesion and traction between the tyre of the vehicle and the road surface during braking when the wheel shows a tendency to lock. The valve comprises one or more solenoid operated valves 34, 40 and 54, 60 in which the solenoid 30 or 50 core defines a chamber 34 or 54 for a fluid under pressure. Preferably the valve member 34 or 54 is in the form of a spool connected to or constituting the armature 36 or 56 and is slidable within the core 31 or 52 . The core has a narrow waisted portion at 47 provided to establish a preferred flux part through the armature.
