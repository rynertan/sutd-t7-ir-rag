## Description
DEOXYURIDINE COMPOUNDS, METHODS FOR PREPARING THEM AND THEIR USE IN MEDICINE This invention relates to certain deoxyuridine compounds which have antiviral activity. Published European Patent Application No.0 061 283 dlscloses esters of 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridines which have anti viral activity selective against herpes viruses. We have now found a group of mono , di and trsubstituted 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridines which have antiviral activity, and which are useful in the treatment of infections caused by herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2 and varicella. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I EMI2.1 in which Y is chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably bromine, each of R1 and R2 is hydrogen or a group of formula R4 CH in which R4 is hydrogen, optionally bR5 halo substituted C1 6 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C1 6 alkyl, R5 is optionally halo substituted C1 6 alkyl or phenyl C1 6alkyl, or R4 and R5 complete a ring system and together represent CH2 3 , CH2 4 or CH2OCH2CH2 , and R is hydrogen or an acyl group of formula X , o in which X is C1 6alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C1 6alkyl, each of which is optionally substituted with halogen, with the proviso that R1 and R2 are not simultaneously hydrogen. Preferably, R2 is hydrogen. Preferably, R4 is hydrogen, methyl,chloro metbyl, ethyl or phenyl, and R5 is methyl, ethyl or benzyl.When R4 and R5 together complete a ring system they preferably represent CH2 4 . When R3 is an acyl group, X is preferably optionally substituted phenyl, suitably chlorosubstituted phenyl. Compounds of formula I in which R4 and R5 complete a ring system, may be prepared by treating a compound of formula II EMI3.1 in which Y and R3 are as defined in formula I , with an ether of formula III EMI3.2 in which Z is hydrogen or a C1 6 alkoxy group, preferably t butoxy and, when Z is hydrogen, the R4R5 group includes a double bond adjacent to the oxygen. The reaction is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, suitably tetrahydrofuran, and in the presence of an acid catalyst, suitably p toluene sulphonic acid. The reaction will generally produce a mixture of three compounds wherein substitution is present at a the 3 posltlon, b the 5 posltion, and c the 3 and 5 positions. The mixture may be separated into its individual components by standard chromatographic methods. Compounds of formula I in which R4 and R5 do not complete a ring system may be prepared by treating a compound of formula II , as defined, with a compound of formula IV EMI4.1 in which w is a C1 6alkoxy group or a halogen atom, preferably chlorine. When W is C1 6 alkoxy the reaction is preferably carried out in a similar reaction medium to that employed in the reaction between compounds of formulae II and III , and a mixture of two compounds will generally be produced in which substitution is present at a the 3 and 5 positions, and b the 5 position. As before, the mixture may be separated into its components by chromatographic methods. When W is halogen, the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert solvent, suitably dimethylformamide, in the presence of a basic catalyst, suitably diisopropylethylamine. This reaction is particularly suitable for preparing compounds of formula I wherein R5 represents a phenyl C1 galkyl group and R4 represents hydrogen. A similar reaction, using 2,4 lutidine as the basic catalyst, is particularly suitable for preparing compounds of formula I wherein R5 represents C16 alkyl and R4 represents hydrogen. Agaln, a mixture of 3 ,5 disubstituted and 3 or 5 mono substituted compounds will generally be produced and the individual compounds can be separated chromatographlcally. Compounds of formula II in which R3 is an acyl group may themselves be produced by selectively hydrolysing a 3,3 ,5 triacylated derivative of a compound of formula II , in the manner as described inPublished European Patent Application No. 0 061 283. The compounds of formulae III and IV , are either known compounds, or can be prepared from known compounds by known methods. The compounds of formula I may be formulated for use in a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compositions which may be administered by the oral route to humans may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an lngestlble capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension. Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The compounds may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for injection. The composition may also be formulated for topical application to the skin or eyes. For topical application to the skin, the compounds of the invention may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. These formulations may be conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harry s Cosmeticology published byLeonard Hill Books and the British Pharmacopaeia. The composition for application to the eyes may be a conventional eye drop composition well known in the art. Preferably, the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of active ingredient, for example 100 to 500 mg. Such doses may be administered 1 to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day. The effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, but is in general in the range of from 1.0 to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 2.0 to 10 mg kg per day. In a further aspect of the invention there is, provided a method of treating viral infections in human or non human animal, which comprises administering to the animal an effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I .

Antiviral ActivityIn VitroMethod Vero African Green Monkey Kidney cells were grown to confluence in 24 well multidishes, each well being 1.6 cm in diameter. The cells were infected withHerpes simplex type 1 virus HFEM strain and overlaid with 0.5m1 of 0.9 agarose w v in maintenance medium. Test compounds prepared in maintenance medium in concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.03 g ml in half log dilution steps, were added in 0.5ml volume. The virus infected cuitures were then incubated at 370C for 4 days before,, fixing in 4 formaldehyde solution and staining with carbolfuchsin. The dishes were then examined to find what concentration of test compound caused a 50 reduction in the number of virus plaques formed PDD50 value and the minimum concentration of test compound which caused cytotoxicity MTD .ResultsExample No PDD50 MTD g ml M g ml 1 4.3 9.0 100 2 1.1 2.8 100 4 17 34 100 5 1.8 4.3 100 6 69 170 100 8 6.4 15 100 10 72 126 100 12 6.6 15 100 19 9.1 17 100 20 3.3 7.5 100 21 19 43 100
