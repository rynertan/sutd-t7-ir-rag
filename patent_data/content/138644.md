## Description
The present invention relates to a plasmid vector and a host harboring the vector. More particularly, it relates to the plasmid vector suitable for use in expression of a protein and secretion of the expressed protein out of a host microbial cell. The OmpF protein, which is one of the proteins constituting the outer membrane of Vector designated as pMH621 containing the The entire DNA sequence of the The present inventors have studied with a great effort the This invention provides a plasmid vector comprising a fragment which comprises the regulator region containing the The invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. In the drawings, Fig. 1 is a schematic view showing the construction of the plasmid according to the present invention, Fig. 2 is the restriction cleavage map of the The starting plasmid for use herein may be any relaxed plasmid derived from The plasmid vector of the invention is constructed by inserting the specified DNA fragment containing the These DNA fragments may be obtainable in the following manner, for example The DNA fragment containing a part of the Alternatively, a foreign gene may be inserted into an appropriate restriction site of a plasmid containing the For increase of the expression level and efficient secretion of the expressed protein, the The fragment which comprises the regulator region containing the The thus obtained fragment may be inserted into a relaxed plasmid derived from The method 3 will be described in more detail below Using the The fragment having cohesive ends or blunt ends formed by the digestion with the specified restriction enzyme such as The plasmid vector of the invention, which is obtained by insertion of the specified fragment containing the In order to ensure the expression of the heterologous gene, transcription and translation of the heterologous gene should be under the control of the Moreover, the heterologous gene having different restriction sites at the 5 and 3 termini, respectively, can be used so as to insert the gene with the proper orientation into the plasmid vector of the invention. According to the present invention, the plasmid vector thus obtained is introduced into a host strain of An example of the host will be The protease activity is the activity of an enzyme which hydrolyzes a peptide linkage. The protease activity is lost herein means that at least one of the several protease activities which are found in Such The use of the plasmid vector containing the The The present invention will further be described in more detail with reference to the following non limiting examples. Various modifications and changes can be made in the examples by those skilled in the art without departing the scope of the present invention. A DNA fragment containing the λ On the other hand, plasmid pBR322 was completely digested with The previously obtained On the other hand, pKEN005 was digested with The plasmid pHF002 was digested with the restriction enzymes Thus, the desired plasmids pHF001, pHF002 and pHF006 were obtained. Plasmid pKEN111 12.2 Kbp containing The Briefly, the bacterial membrane fraction labelled with ³⁵S methionine was reacted with the anti lipoprotein antibody. The precipitated fraction was electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography. In the analysis, The results showed that Plasmid pA22, which was constructed by C. Weissmann et al., is a circular plasmid containing the Plasmid pBR322 was partially digested with The resultant plasmid was used for transformation of The precursor gene of approximately 11.5 Kbp was used as the starting material. The gene is considered to code for the precursor protein comprising 267 amino acid residues and may be obtained from the generally available DNA derived from human placenta or similar materials by Nakanishi et al. method Nature, The 11.5 Kbp fragment of the ACTH β LPH precursor gene was The resulting plasmid was used for transforming The plasmid pHLA 1 was digested with The plasmid pYT1 was digested with The plasmid pA22 obtained in A and the ACTH β LPH fragment obtained in B were each digested with The plasmid pYT3 was digested with Plasmid RSF2124 trp Gene, The The 160 bp The plasmid pBR322trpE obtained in II was digested with The plasmid pBR322trpEβE was digested with Then, the plasmid pBR322trpEβEΔλP Plasmid pUC8 Gene, The plasmid pHF006, which was obtained in Example 1 Fig. 1 , was digested with The transformant containing pHF006βE was cultivated on M 9 medium Experiments in Molecular Genetics, p. 431, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 1972 . The grown cells were harvested at the logarithmic phase and 50 ml of the cells were subjected to fractionation to each component by the conventional methods but, in the case of the membraneous components, by the method described in Journal of Bacteriology, The amount of β endorphin produced in each fraction and the medium was investigated by radioimmunoassay using ¹²⁵I β endorphin as a label. The results are shown in Table 1. The plasmid vector pHF006βE was introduced into At each growth phase, the medium was fractionated by centrifugation and the amount of β endorphin in the medium was determined by radioimmunoassay using ¹²⁵I β endorphin as a label. The results are shown in Table 2. The medium at the logarithmic phase after 6 hours from the inoculation was dialysed against 10 ml of ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized to concentrate and subjected to electrophoresis on 19 SDS polyacrylamide gel. A protein band showing β endorphin activity in RIA was found. The plasmid pHF006βE was treated with These transformant were cultured in M 9 minimal medium to the logarithmic phase and investigated the β endorphin activity in the culture medium by radioimmunoassay to determine the transformant The fused protein having β endorphin activity in RIA was purified from the culture medium by concentration, desalting and HPLC. The amino acid sequencing showed that the fused protein was a protein which had the amino acid sequence deduced from the entire DNA sequence of Fig. 4 but from which the signal peptide of 22 amino acids was deleted.
