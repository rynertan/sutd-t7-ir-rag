# Process for producing electroconductive films.

## Abstract
A process for producing an electroconductive film having a volume resistivity of fiber oriented direction of not more than 1 10‚Å∏ ohm cm comprising mixing from 94.5 to 40 volume of a thermoplastic synthetic pulp with from 5 to 30 by volume of thermoplastic composite fibers comprising of a first component having a lower melting point than that of said thermoplastic synthetic pulp and a second component having a higher melting point than that of said thermoplastic synthetic pulp, and from 0.5 to 30 by volume of electroconductive fibers to prepare a paper stock forming a wet web from the paper stock heating and drying said wet web at a specific first temperature to melt the first component of the composite fibers, thereby forming a base paper and thereafter heating said base paper under pressure at a specific second temperature to melt the thermoplastic synthetic pulp, thereby forming a film having dispersed said second component and said electroconduc tive fibers therein.
