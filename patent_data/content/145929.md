# Ultraviolet curable coating composition and coated optical fiber.

## Abstract
Buffer coated and overcoated optical glass fiber is dis closed in which the topcoat has the high strength and high tensile modulus combined with good elongation and solvent resistance associated with extruded jacket coatings, but which is applied by ordinary coating procedures and cured by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The coating com positions which enable this to be achieved comprise 30 to about 80 of linear diethylenic polyester polyurethanes which are the linear polyurethane reaction product of an organic diisocyanate with hydroxy functional polyester formed by reacting a diol, such as ethylene glycol, with with certain dicarboxylic acids, such as adipic acid. This poly urethane is end capped with a monoethylenically un saturated monohydric alcohol. At least 50 of this diethyl enic polyester polyurethane is combined with at least 5 of liquid diethylenic diester of a diglycidyl ether of a bis phenol, and at least 5 of liquid monoethylenically un saturated monomer having a glass transition temperature above about 55 C, these proportions being based on total reactive components.
