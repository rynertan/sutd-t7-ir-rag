# Method of sintering beta alumina ceramic bodies, encapsulation chamber for use in such a method, and method of manufacturing such a chamber.

## Abstract
A method of sintering a shaped green, beta type alu mina body 4 comprises A inserting said body 4 into an open chamber 2 prepared by exposing the interior surface of a container consisting essentially of at least about 50 weight percent of alpha alumina and a remainder of other refractory material to a sodium oxide or sodium oxide producing environment B sealing the chamber 2 and heating the chamber 2 with the shaped body 4 encapsulated therein to a temperature and for a time necessary to sinter said body 4 to the desired density. The encapsulation chamber 2 prepared as described above is also disclosed.
