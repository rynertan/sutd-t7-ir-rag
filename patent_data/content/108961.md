## Description
Thyristor device protected from an overvoltage This invention relates to a thyristor device which is protected from an overvoltage. When an voltage exceeding a breakover voltage VBD an overvoltage is applied between the anode and cathode of a thyristor, the thyristor device is broken by such minute breakover currents as several to scores of mA. To prevent a thyristor device from being broken by a mistaken ignition resulting from the application of an overvoltage a rated voltage 2 to 3 times higher than a source voltage is applied to a thyristor device.With a device such as a D.C. transmission thyristor value constructed by connecting many thyristors in series, some of the thyristors which have failed to be rendered conducting are undesirably impressed with an overvoltage several times higher than the rated voltage.In such a case, it is impossible to prevent a thyristor device from being broken by an overvoltage. From the above, there is a pressing need to develop a thyristor device protected from an overvoltage and the resulting breakage. An example of a thyristor device protected from an overvoltage is set forth in V.A.K. Temple Controlled Thyristor Turn on For High di dtCapability , IEDM, 1981, pp406 to 409. This thyristor device consists of a main thyristor and pilot thyristor.Further proposed are a thyristor device using a thinned N base to control the VBD location, and a thyristor device utilizing curvature effects. When an overvoltage is applied in the forward direction between the anode and cathode of the main thyristor, an electric field is concentrated on the VBD location, causing a breakover. The resultant breakover current acts as the gate current of a pilot thyristor, rendering the pilot thyristor conducting. The conduction of the pilot thyristor enable the main thyristor to be safely triggered. However, the above mentioned type of thyristor device has the drawback that the breakover current is concentrated on the narrow curved section of the thyristor device, probably breaking it before its main thyristor is fully rendered conducting.Consequently difficulties were encountered in developing a thyristor device which could be triggered with a high di dt capability critical rate of rise of on state current . It is accordingly the object of this invention to provide a thyristor device protected from an overvoltage which has a high di dt capability even when impressed with an overvoltage. To attain the above mentioned object this invention provides a thyristor device protected from an overvoltage which comprises a P type emitter layer, an N type base layer deposited on said P type emitter layer to define a first PN junction, a P type base layer mounted on said N type base layer to define a second PN junction, one part of which constitutes a breakover region impressed with a lower breakover voltage than any other region, a first N type emitter layer mounted on the P type base layer, to define a third PN junction, said P type emitter layer, N type base layer, P type base layer and first N type emitter layer jointly constituting a main thyristor, a second N type emitter layer deposited on the P type base layer, to define a fourth PN junction, said P type emitter layer, N type base layer, P type base layer and second emitter layer collectively constituting a pilot thyristor, which is rendered conducting by a breakover current produced in the breakover region, and wherein a minimum trigger current for the pilot thyristor is chosen to be smaller than half a maximum breakover current allowed for the breakover region, an anode electrode mounted on the P type emitter layer, a cathode electrode deposited on the first N type emitter layer, and an auxiliary electrode laid on the second N type emitter layer. This invention offers the following advantages a pilot thyristor can be easily triggered by a minute breakover current produced by impression of an overvoltage, thereby assuring a high di dt capability and the thyristor can be provided with overvoltage suppressing means without damaging the main properties of the thyristor such as its on sate voltage. Other objects and advantages will be apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of a thyristor device according to a first embodiment of this invention Fig. 2 graphically shows the relationship between a trigger current IGT supplied to a thyristor device protected from an overvoltage and the di dt capability and Figs. 3 to 5 are crossectional views of thyristor devices according to other embodiments of the invention. A thyristor device protected from an overvoltage according to a first embodiment of this invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 1. The thyristor device comprises a P type emitter layer 11, an N type base layer 12, a P type base layer 13, an N type emitter layer 14, and an N type auxiliary emitter layer 17. The P type emitter layer 11 and N type base layer 12 form a first PN junction. The N type base layer 12 and P type base layer 13 constitute a secondPN junction. The P type base layer 13 and N type emitter layer 14 constitute a third PN junction.The P type base layer 13 and N type auxiliary emitter layer 17 form a fourth PN junction. An anode electrode 15 is mounted on the P type emitter layer 11, and a cathode electrode 16 is deposited on the N type emitter layer 14. The N type emitter layer 14, P type base layer 13 and cathode electrode 16 provide a shorted emitter structure. An auxiliary electrode 18 is formed on the N type auxiliary emitter layer 17. The N type auxiliary emitter layer 17, P type base layer 13 and auxiliary electrode 18 constitute a shorted emitter structure. The P type emitter layer 11, N type base layer 12, P type base layer 13 and N type emitter layer 14 form a main thyristor MT. The P type emitter layer 11, N type base layer 12, P type base layer 13 and N type auxiliary emitter layer 17 constitute a pilot thyristor PT.The N type auxiliary emitter layer 17 of the pilot thyristor PT has a greater depth than the N type emitter layer 14 of the main thyristor MT.Therefore, the P type base layer 13 of the pilot thyristor PT is chosen to have a higher crosswise resistance than the P type base layer 13 of the main thyristor MT. The pilot thyristor PT is formed in the inner peripheral wall of the main thyristor MT. A P type base layer 30 comprising a curved section 19 is provided on the inner peripheral wall of the pilot thyristor PT. The P type base layer 30 is fabricated, for example, by etching the P type base layer 13 in the form of a well and later thermally defusing a P type impurity from the surface, or by etching an N type semiconductor wafer in the form of a well and diffusing the P type impurity from both sides of said N type semiconductor wafer. When an overvoltage is applied in the forward direction between the anode and cathode electrodes of the aforementioned structure, an electric field in concentrated on the curved section 19, causing a breakover current to be produced in the proximity of said curved section 19. The pilot thyristorPT is rendered conducting by said breakover current, followed by the conduction of the main thyristor MT.In the foregoing embodiment, a minimum trigger current IGT for the pilot thyristor PT which is first rendered conducting is smaller than at least half a maximum allowable breakover current produced in the breakover region provided in the curved section 19. To provide the above mentioned minimum trigger current IGT, it is advisable to increase the crosswise resistance of the pilot thyristor PT to fully elevate the gate sensitivity of the pilot thyristor PT.This process, described below in relation to Fig. 2 prominently, improves the di dt capability when an overvoltage is impressed. The experiments conducted with the present inventors prove that a pilot thyristor can be safely rendered conducting. The abscissa of Fig. 2 represents a breakover current IR produced when the pilot thyristorPT was triggered by an overvoltage. This breakover current IR is equal to the trigger current IGT of the pilot tyristor PT. The ordinate denotes the di dt capabilities of the test samples corresponding to the breakover current IGT. Fig. 2 shows that the di dt capability occurring at the impression of an overvoltage increases as the pilot thyristor attains higher sensitivity and consequently can be satisfactorily triggered by a small trigger current IGT.However, all the test samples comprising a pilot thyristor having a larger trigger current than 45 mA have the following drawback the di dt capability suddenly drops when the trigger current rises above 45 mA, thus making it impossible to completely trigger a thyristor device when an overvoltage occurs. The reason for the above mentioned drawback is that when the trigger current IGT exceeds 45 mA, the breakover current of the curved section 19 of the test samples used in the experiment rises above an allowed level, causing said curved section 19 to be broken before the pilot thyristor PT is rendered conducting.Fig. 2 further indicates that unless the trigger current IGT is set at a level lower than half to the maximum level IR max 45 mA hereinafter referred to as Ba maximum of the breakover current IR max , then the di dt capability cannot be improved. As inferred from Fig. 2, therefore, a high sensitivity pilot thyristor meeting the condition of at least IGT 1 IR max should be set near the 2 current section 19 in order to produce a thyristor device which can be completely triggered even when an overvoltage occurs and retains a high di dt capability. The present inventors experiments further prove that the maximum breakover current IR max increases substantially in proportion to the peripheral length of the curved section 19. If, however, the curved section 19 is chosen to have an unduly long peripheral extension, the following difficulty arises when a sharply rising voltage noise is supplied the resultant increase in the di dt capability conversely leads to a prominent decline in the dv dt capability. The reason for this undesirable occurrence is that a displacement current arising in the curved section 19 increases in proportion to the square of the peripheral length of said curved section 19. Therefore, it is impossible to extend the peripheral length of the curved section 19 indefinitely.Consequently a thyristor device protected from an overvoltage which has a high di dt capability should preferably be provided without sacrificing the main thyristor property such as a dv dt capability by surrounding the curved section 19 with a high sensitivity pilot thyristor which can be triggered by a small trigger current IGT. According to the present invention, a high sensitivity pilot thyristor device is constructed by rendering the width of the P type base layer 13 underlying the N type emitter layer 17 of the pilot thyristor PT smaller than that of the P type base layer 13 of the main thyristor MT. As a result, the P type base layer 13 of the pilot thyristor PT has an increased crosswise resistance, thereby elevating the trigger sensitivity of said pilot thyristor PT. A 4 KV thyristor device with dv dt 2 1500 v s and di dt 250 A s could be produced by setting the diameter of the curved section 19 at 0.5 mm, that is, by choosing its peripheral length to be 1.57 mm in order to obtain a maximum breakover current Ir max ranging from 40 to 45 mA and controlling the resistance of the P type base layer of the pilot thyristor PT to about 2000 n o in order to decrease the trigger current IGT from 5 mA. As described above, the present invention can provide a thyristor device protected from an overvoltage with a substantially improved di dt capability without sacrificing the main thyristor properties such as the dv dt capability. A thyristor device protected from an overvoltage according to a second embodiment of this invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 3. A P type emitter layer 11, N type base layer 12. P type base layer 13 and N type emitter layer 14 jointly constitute a main thyristor MT. An anode electrode 15 is mounted on the P type emitter layer 11 a cathode electrode 16 is deposited on the N type emitter layer 16 and a gate electrode 20 is set on the P type base layer 13. A pilot thyristor PT consisting of an auxiliary N type emitter layer 17 and auxiliary electrode 18 is provided between the gate electrode 20 and cathode electrode 16. Part of a second PN junction defined by the N type base layer 12 and P type base layer 13 is curved. The upper end of the curved portion 19 is exposed to that surface of the thyristor device on which the cathode electrode 16 is deposited. The base width WPB of that portion of the P type base layer 13 which lies immediately below the N type emitter layer 17 of the pilot thyristor PT is rendered narrower than that of the P type base layer 13 of the main thyristor MT. Therefore, the P type base layer 13 of the pilot thyristor PT is chosen to have a higher crosswise resistance Rp than that of the main thyristor MT. When an overvoltage is applied in the forward direction between the anode electrode 15 and cathode electrode 16, breakover appears at the curved section 19 of the PN junction of the P type base layer 13 and N type base layer 12. The resultant backover current IR flows acrose the P type base layer 13 to the cathode electrode 16 through the short circuit section 21 of the main thyristor MT. The breakover current IR causes a decline in the voltage impressed across theP type base layer 13 in a lateral direction. As a result, the N type emitter layer 17 of the pilot thyristor PT is biased in the forward direction.When the forward bias voltage is higher than the diffusion potential of a fourth PN junction defined by the N type emitter layer 17 and P type base layer 13, the influx of electrons from the N type emitter layer 17 suddenly increases and renders the pilot thyristor PT conducting.An output current from the conducted pilot thyristorPT acts as a gate current for the main thyristor MT, eventually conducting the main thyristor MT. The gate sensitivity of the pilot thyristorPT is determined by the crosswise resistance Rp of that portion of the P type base layer 13 which lies immediately below the pilot thyristor PT. In the embodiment of Fig. 3, the above mentioned crosswise resistance Rp is related to the sheet resistance Psp of the P type base layer 13 and the geometric pattern of the N type emitter layer 17. Now assuming that the characters dl and d2 respectively represent the inner and outer diameters of the ring shaped N type emitter layer 17, then the crosswise resistance Rp is rendered proportional to Psp and Zn d2 dl .The gate sensitivity of the pilot thyristor PT is increasingly elevated, as the crosswise resistance Rp increases, thus enabling the pilot thyristor PT to be triggered by a small breakover current. Actually, the pilot thyristorPT could be triggered by a smaller breakover current than 5 mA, under the following conditions Sheet resistance of the P type base layer 13 of the main thyrsitor MT 500 n z Sheet resistance Psp just below the pilot thyristor PT 3000 n o Diameter dl 1.5 mmf Diameter d2 2.0 mmf The above mentioned breakover current of less than 5 mA accounts for less than 1 6 of a minimum breakover current used for the conventional thyristor having a sheet resistance Psp 500 Q o. The minimum trigger current realized with the thyristor device embodying this invention accounts for less than half a maximum breakover current produced in the breakovr region constituted by the curved section 19. Since the pilot thyristor PT can be triggered by an extremely small breakover current, a thyristor device embodying this invention can preserve a high di dt capability even when triggered by an overvoltage. A thyristor device according to a third embodiment of this invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 4. A light receiving section 22 to be supplied with a light trigger signal is formed inside the pilot thyristor of the subject thyristor device. The other parts of Fig. 4 are the same as those of the thyristor device of Fig. 3, description thereof is omitted. The light activated thyristor device of Fig. 4 has the same effect as that previously described. A thyristor device according to a fourth embodiment of this invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 5. With this thyristor device, a semiconductor region constituting a pilot thyristor PT is selected with a longer carrier life time T2 than the carrier life time Tl of the other regions. The above mentioned arrangement increases the coefficient by which an electron avalanche occurring in the semiconductor region of the pilot thyristor is multiplied. Therefore, the pilot thyristor PT has a lower breakover voltage than any other region of a thyristor device. With the thyristor device of Fig. 5 according to the fourth embodiment of this invention, too, a minimum trigger current is chosen to be smaller than half a maximum breakover current allowed for the pilot thyristor.
