# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MAKING LARGE AREA PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICES INCORPORATING BACK REFLECTORS

## Abstract
A system and method for making photovoltaic devices of the type including a plurality of amorphous semiconduc tor materials 16a c, 18a c, 20a c deposited onto a conti nuous conductive substrate 11 provides a reflector on the surface of the substrate 11 upon which the amorphous semiconductor materials 16a c, 18a c, 20a c are depos ited to improve the efficiencies thereof. The reflectors can be either specular reflectors or diffuse reflectors. The spec ular reflectors are formed by vapor depositing a reflective material such as gold, silver, aluminum, copper, chromium, or molybdenum onto the substrate 11 . The diffuse reflec tors can be formed by imparting a roughened texture to the substrate surface 13 by, for example, sandblasting the substrate surface 13 or by sputtering a first reflective ma terial thereon. A second reflective material 15 can be va por deposited over the diffuse reflectors prior to the deposi tion of the amorphous semiconductor materials 16a c, 18a c, 20a c . The reflectors can be formed either imme diately prior to the deposition of the amorphous semicon ductor materials 16a c, 18a c, 20a c or at a remote lo cation at which the substrate 11 is wound onto a take up roll and thereafter transported to a plurality of deposition chambers for the later deposition of the amorphous semi conductor materials 16a c, 18a c, 20a c .
