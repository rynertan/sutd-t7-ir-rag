## Abstract
A pipe shell is provided with an outer cover of a flexible material by an automatic procedure. The invention provides also the machinery. A web 11a of the flexible material is withdrawn from a supply roller. A tape 20 having an adhesive on both sides is attached crosswise the web at the front edge. A web length substantially equal to the circumference of the pipe shell or the tube shaped body plus the width of the strip is withdrawn. A second tape 20 having adhesive on both sides is attached crosswise the web 17 at a distance from the front edge of the web equal to said web length. The web which preferably has been provided with an adhesive 23, 24 in advance, at least partially, in the area between the strips is cut such that said web length is obtained. The pipe shell 17 is placed onto the cut web length with a cut through in the shell extending in the direction of the generatrix in register with the cut edge of the web. The adhesive is activated and the pipe shell is rolled on the cut web length such that is encompasses the pipe shell with an overlap corresponding to the width of the tape. The procedure is repeated for a desired number of pipe shells and pipe shell diameters, respectively.

## Description
A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR APPLYINGA WRAPPING AROUND A TUBE SHAPED BODY The present invention relates to a method and a device for applying a wrapping onto a tube shaped body. More precisely the invention relates to a method and an arrangement for applying said wrapping onto a bulky tube shaped body of a relatively soft material. A typical body comprises a tube shaped body for insulation purposes, a so called pipe shell. Such a pipe shell or tube shaped body generally is manufactured from some fibre material, for instance glass wool. Presently the shells are applied around pipe conduits for forming an insulation, primarily a heat insulation, but also a sound insulation. The pipe shell technique has also been developed to comprise an external laminate of a metal foil in order to improve the protection, mainly the fire protection. The problem is to offer a rational method and an efficient arrangement for applying such laminate onto the tube shaped body. Previously it has been used more or less manual methods, work intensive as such, but also involving a manual handling of cumbersome fibre material having certain health dangerous effects when handling such material wrongly. The object of the present invention is to eliminate the shortcomings and offer a competitive alternative to known methods. The invention provides a method for applying, by means of an activatable adhesive layer, onto a tube shaped body of an insulating material, for instance glass wool, an external cover of a flexible material, for instance a laminate of plastics and metal foil, where a web of a flexible material is withdrawn from a supply roller onto a support by means of a withdrawing means.The method is characterized in that a first strip coated on both sides thereof by an adhesive material is attached crosswise the flexible web at the front edge thereof, that a web length substantially equal to the circumference of the tube shaped body plus the width of said strip is withdrawn, that a second strip having an adhesive material on both sides thereof is attached crosswise the web at a distance from the front edge of the flexible material web corresponding to the said web length, that the web is cut just in front of the second strip, that the tube shaped body is placed onto the cut web length with a cut through region of the body extending in the direction of the generatrix in register with the cut edge of the web, that the adhesive layer is activated, and that the tube shaped body is rolled onto the cut web length such that said web length is brought to encompass the tube shaped body and cover the tube shaped body with an overlap in the region of the first strip. The adhesive preferably is applied onto the entire surface of the laminate before it is rolled to form said supply roller. As an adhesive layer is selected a heat sealable layer, for instance a polyolefine, ionomer, etc. The flexible web preferably is selected as a laminate having a filler added thereto for forming a non combustible laminate of for instance polypropylene having said filler and aluminium foil. The invention also provides a device for practising the method. The device is distinguished by means for applying a strip having an adhesive coating on both sides thereof crosswise the flexible web of material in a first station, means for withdrawing in said first station onto a support a web length substantially equal to the circumference of the tube shaped body plus the width of strip, by means in said first station for cutting said web length, by means for placing in said first station the tube shaped body onto the support with a cut through region in the body extending in the direction of the generatrix and in register with the cut edge, by means for rolling the tube shaped body on he support simultaneously as activating the adhesive on the cut flexible web such that the web is brought to encompass the tube shaped body. Said means for rolling the tube shaped body preferably comprises a roller device that is moveable in the longitudinal direction of the support. Said means for placing the tube shaped body onto the support comprises a lay down member moveable crosswise the support. Said means for applying the strip having an adhesive material on both sides thereof comprises a device for applying a tape having adhesive on both sides thereof onto the flexible material web. Said means for cutting the flexible material web comprises a knife moveable crosswise the web. One embodiment of the invention will be described by reference to the accompanying drawings, whereFigure 1 is a schematic side view of a device according to the invention for applying a surface layer onto a tube shaped body,Figure 2 is a side view of the device,Figure 3 is a schematic operation view showing the initial phase, andFigure 4 shows a final phase. The reference numeral 10 in Figure 1 denotes a stand which supports a supply roller 11 comprising a flexible wrapping material, in the present case a laminate of a aluminium foil and polypropylene with a filler of a noncombustible material. The side of the laminate denoted by lla in the Figure is coated by a well heat sealable layer, for instance of an ionomer. The web lla is fed into a station 12 and gripped by a pulling device 13. This device grips the web at the front edge thereof crosswise the width of the web in the position indicated by 14. Before the web is pulled forwards rightwards from the position 14 an applicator device 15 Figure 2 for the tape having the adhesive on both sides is brought into operation. This device applies a strip of tape crosswise the front edge of the web. The cover layer of the tape which is turned upwards seen according to Figure 1 is not removed. As soon as the tape is attached, the pulling device is started and pulls forward a web length somewhat longer than the circumference of the actual pipe shaped body pipe shell to be covered by the actual web. As soon as the web length is available to the right of position 14 in Figure 1, the tape applicator 15 is brought into operation and applies a new strip of a tape 20 having adhesive on both sides crosswise the web 11. Thereafter an insertion device or a loading device 16 for pipe shells 17 is brought into operation. This places the tube shells 17 such that a longitudinal cut through slot 18 in the pipe shell is turned downwards crosswise the material web 11 just in front of the tape 20. A knife device 19 Figure 3 thereafter is operated and cuts the material web just in front of the tape 20 last applied. The upper side 21 of the web in this case is coated by an ionomer layer and this layer is heat activated for sealing by a device 22. This device comprises mutually spaced heat jaws the distance is variable and the idea is that said jaws should activate only narrow regions 23, 24 just adjacent to the front tape 20 and adjacent to the cut edge obtained by the knife 19. A moveable carriage 25 comprising press rollers 25a thereafter rolls the shell 17 onto the support 26 at the same time as the laminate 11 is brought to tightly encompass the circumferential surface of the shell 17. The cut length of the laminate web is such that an overlap is obtained in the position 27 Figure 4 , i.e. the remaining cover strip of the tape having adhesive on both sides is located on the other side of the cut through 18. When mounting it will be easy to remove the cover strip and attach the hole unit by means of the actual strip after the cover strip has been removed. After the pipe shell has been provided with the wrapping and removed from the support the procedure that has been described is repeated. Although a specific embodiment of the present invention has been described by reference to the drawings, it is realized that alternatives and modifications are possible within the scope of the claims. Instead of having a circular pipe shaped body it is for instance possible to have various polygonal cross sections if required. As an adhesive it is always possible to use an adhesive that is applicable in the machinery, for instance a hot melt.
