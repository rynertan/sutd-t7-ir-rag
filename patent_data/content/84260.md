# Semiconductor integrated circuit device with test circuit.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit IC I, II device including therein a test circuit 20 . The test circuit operates to distinguish the power source level or ground level occurring at an internal node N , under testing located inside the semiconductor chip. The test circuit is comprised of a series connected MIS transistor 24 , and MIS diode 25 . The gate 22 , of the MIS transistor is connected to the internal node N . The MIS diode is connected to an external input output I O pin 21 . The level at the internal node. i.e., the power source level or the ground level, can be disting uished by a first voltage level or a second voltage level applied to the external I O pin, whichever enables a current to be drawn from the external I O pin.
