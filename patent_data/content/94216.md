# Diagnostic test apparatus for use in an immunoassay and method employing the apparatus.

## Abstract
An improved test tube rack 48 for receiving beads employ ed in an immunoassay is used with a matching sample tray 32 , the tray and rack featuring aligning pins and holes 52, 53 and 34, 35 so that the test tubes 42 are juxtaposed with associated sample wells 32 when the rack 48 is assembled to the tray 30 . The test tubes 42 are a push fit in holes 50 in the rack 48 and are larger at their mouths than their bases the test tubes 42 and the wells 32 interfit tightly to avoid leakage of liquid when the assembled tray and rack are inverted to deposit the beads in the test tubes. The rack and the tray are correspondingly numbered for identification of the sample wells 32 with the test tubes 42 .
