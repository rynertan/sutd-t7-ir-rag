The part density of the incomplete part is determined and is ratioed to the known volume of the mold so as to ascertain the minimum amount of reaction products required to fill the mold. The Brett mold is a mold developed by the refrigeration industry in Europe which has a cavity measuring 200 cm x 20 cm x 5 cm. PACKING TO NON SHRINK DENSITY The weight percent of the difference between the part density and the minimum fill density is the packing. The packing level is varied in order to determine the minimum packing which results in no shrinkage of a Brett molded part when placed in a 200F 290C environment for 24 hours. The packing in which no shrinkage is observed is the packing to non shrink density.EXPANSION AT DEMOLD Upon unclamping the Brett mold, the gap or expansion between the two mold halves is measured at 6 minutes from the time of filling the mold. The Brett mold is filled to 14 excess of the minimum fill density.
