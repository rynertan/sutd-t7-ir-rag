# A method for forming monocrystalline semiconductor film on insulating film.

## Abstract
A monocrystalline semiconductor film is formed on an insulating film first by selectively forming at least one insulating film 13 which has sides 13a substantially perpendicular to 100 or 211 axes, contiguous to a cubic crystal system monocrystalline semiconductor subs trate 11 . An amorphous film 14 of a cubic crystal system semiconductor material is formed to cover an exposed surface of the substrate 11 and the insulating film 13 . The amorphous semiconductor film 14 is annealed under a condition such that the amorphous film 14 is grown from the substrate 11 by solid phase expitaxial growth, thereby converting the amorphous film 14 to a monocrystalline semiconductor film having a crystal lattice continuous to that of the substrate 11 .
