# Compression drum for cigarettes.

## Abstract
This invention relates to compression drums 1 for orderly groups of cigarettes G in automatic cigarette packing machines. Said drums comprise one or more compression pockets 2 each having a substantially rectangular cross section and each including, at least partly, movable sidewalls permitting the cross section of a pocket to be varied between a maximum expansion condition, wherein an orderly group of cigarettes G to be packed is introduced thereinto, and a maximum compression condition, wherein the group of cigarettes G received in the pocket 2 is compressed. According to the invention, at least two adjacent sidewalls 3, 4 and or 3 min , 4 min of each compression pocket 2 , one of which 3, 3 min corresponds to a longer side and the other to a shorter side of said rectangular cross section, are separate from each other and from the other sidewalls of said pocket and are movable independently from each other and each one with respect to the opposite respective sidewall 3 min , 4 min and or 3, 4 so as to achieve a mutual movement of the walls of each pair of opposite sidewalls of a compression pocket 2 toward each other and away from each other.
