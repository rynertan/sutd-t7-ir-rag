## Description
Detection of cancerous or malignant tumor cells the present invention relates to a process for detecting the presence of cancerous or malignant tumor cells in a cell collection in vitus or in vivo, and more particularly relates to such a process utilising products, herein termed target attaching globulins TAG prQducts which are derivatives of compounds herein termed recognins, and which are capable of preferentially attaching to cancerous or malignant tumor cells. Recognins are made by treating abnormal vells or tissues, for example, tumor cells or artificial cancer cells and separating out the desired products. By the term recognin as used herein and throughout the specification is meant an abnormal cell or tissue associated compound which is characterised by a being capable of forming a single line precipitate with its specific antibody in quantitative precipitation tests and Ouchterlony gel diffusion test b being soluble in water and aqueous solutions at acid or neutral pH c being insoluble in aqueous solutions at alkaline pH d having a spectrophotometric absorption peak wave length of 280mu e having a molecular weight of from 3,000 to 25,000 and f having an amino acid residue composition in which there is a high proportion of glutamic acid and aspartic acid with respect to the total amino acid residue composition and a high ratio of these acids to histidine. The ognins may be used to prepare their Ã§hemoreciprocals, i.e., byrcontacting the recognins or the recognins on a support with body fluids. The chemoreciprocals are useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, i.e., for diagnosing and treating cancers.The chemoreciprocals are substances which react with immunochemical like specificity with a recognin in vivo in vitro, i.e. in quantitative precipitation test, inOuchterlony double diffusion or in immunofluorescence. One recognin is Astrocytin. Astrocytin is produced from brain tumor tissue, preferably brain glioma tumor tissue. Protein fractions containing the Astrocytin preceursor are first extracted from the tissue. A preferred method of accomplishing the extraction is to treat the tissue with a neutral buffer under conditions of homogenization or other techniques to disrupt the cells and tissues in order to solubilize protein fractions which contain the Astrocytin precursor. At this point, the Astrocytin precursor is still bound to many large molecular weight substances including protein, hlycoproteins, lipoproteins, nucleic acids and nucleoproteins. The solubilized proteins are then separated from the resultant tissue extract. The extract solution from the tissue is then clarified to remove insoluble particles. The low molecular weight contaminants are then removed from the resultant solution, by a pre evaporation concentration technique. The solution which is obtained is then treated to cleave Astrocytin precursor from other contaminants in order to obtain the protein fraction having a pk range between 1 and 4. Thus, for example, the solution is placed on a chromatographic column and eluted with increasingly acidic solvents.All of the fractions which are eluted in the neutral or acid range down to pK 4 are discarded and those fractions with pK range of from 1 to 4 are collected. The eluate is then treated to obtain a product having a molecular weight of about 8,000. Wlis iS accomplished, for example, by first filtering the material to remove low molecular weight substances, i.e., those below 1,000 molecular weight, and filtering again to remove those above 25,000. The fraction having a molecular weight between 1,000 and 25,000 is then further treated, i.e., by thin layer gel TLG chromatography, to obtain Astrocytin. Thus Astrocytin may be produced by extracting brain glioma tumor tissue with a neutral buffer, by repeated homogenization and high speed centrifugation, separating from the resulting extract the fraction having a pK range of from 1 to 4, separating from said fraction the substances having a high molecularweight, i.e., up to about 230,000 and isolating therefrom the productAstrocytin having a molecular weight of about 8,000. The product Astrocytin prepared in accordance with this process is characterized by forming a single line precipitate with its specific antibody in quantitative precipitin tests and Ouchterlony gel diffusion tests, being soluble in water and aqueous solutinns having an acid or neutral pH, and insoluble at an alkaline pH, having a spectrophotometric absorption peak wave length 280 my and having a molecular weight of about 8,000. Astrocytin is also characterized by having a very high percentage of residues of glutamic acid and aspartic acid and a very high ratio of these acids to histidine.A further analysis of Astrocytin is provided below. In a tanner similar to that described above, another Recognin, called Malignin, is produced from artificial cancer cells, i.e., cancer cells grown in vitro. Malignin has a molecular weight of about 10,000 and a similar but distinct amino acid residue composition to Astrocytin, i.e., high ratios of glutamic acid and asparticid and high ratios of these acids to histidine. ,8 further analysis of MaPignin is provided below. Thus, Malignin can be produced by extracting art ificial cancer cells grown in culture with a neutral buffer by repeated homogenization and high speed centrifugation, separating from the resulting extract the fraction having a pK range of about 1 to 4, separating from said fraction the substances having a high molecular weight, i.e. up to about 230,000, and isolating therefrom the product having a molecular weight of about 10,000. The amount of Malignin produced in artificial cell fermentation and the percentage of total protein produced in artificial ce ll fermentation which isMalignin can be increased by growth of artificial cancer cell culture in large size growth containers. Malignin prepared in accordance with this process is characterized by forming a single line precipitate with its specific antibody in quantitative precipitin tests andOuchterlony gel diffusion tests, being soluble in water and aqueous solutions having an acid or neutral pH and insoluble at an alkaline pH, having a spectrophotometric absorption peak wave length of 280 mp and having a molecular weight of about 10,000. Recognins are further characterized by being capable of complexing with bromoacetylcellulose to form bromoacetylcellulose Recognin and producing the specific antibodies Anti Recognin upon injection into mammals, said Anti recognin attaching specifically to the recognin precursor in situ and producing fluorescence of glioma cells when coupled with fluorescein, as described in further detail below. One anti Recognin, anti Malignin is toxic, to brain tumor cells in vitro. Anti recognins are antibodies to the group of antigens which are herein termed recognins, and they form a single line precipitate withRecognins in quantitative precipitation tests and Ouchterlony gel diffusion test. Rec3 gnins, such as Astrocytin, M lignin and similar substEXcea areuseful as products which may be introduced into a.biological system to reduce foreign reactions, such as by coating a material with a Recognin. A further example may be to introduce a Recognin in order to produce the Chemoreciprocals in the biological system.They may also be used nutritionally to encourage the growth of a particular biological system of which they are a part. A further utility of Recognin is the production of Target reagents which comprise the complexes of the Recognin with a carrier to facilitate its applicability in biological systems. Thus, for example, the complex conveys the physical chemical characteristics of the Recognin itself. The carrier should be selected from those which form a complex with the Recognin and which are substantially biologically inert. Any substance known in the art which will form a stable complex with polypeptides or proteins may be useful for complexing with the Recognin. An example is a eellÃ¹lose based material, such as the aforementioned bromoacetyl cellulose. In addition to being inert to the biological system, the carrier should be one that does not alter the specific physical chemical properties of the Recognin which are useful for the purposes set forth herein. The complexes of the Recognin and its carrier are useful for producing, separating and identifying its chemoreciprocal in any biological system with which it is brought into contact. The Recognin carrier complex is also useful for stimulating the production of its chemoreciprocal precusor in any biological system into which it is introduced. The class of Chemoreciprocals termed anti Recognins, e.g. anti Astrocytin and anti Malignin, may be made by injecting the Recognin into a biological system. Thus, an immunologically effective dose of Recognin is brought into contact with bodily tissues or flutes in a manner , which induces an antibody response in accordance with techniques known in the art for producing antibodies. The zanti Recognins may be used.for the delivery of materials such as diagnostic, nutritional and therea peutic agents to specific cells or sites in a biological. system which comprises introducing said agent in com plexed form with the anti Recognin into the biological system. The anti Recognins are also useful for diag nosing the presence of tumor cells in a histology section, by applying the Anti Recognin conjugated with a labeling substance such as dyes and radioactive substances, to said section, whereby staining or radio active labeling occurs only with tumor cells. Yet another use for anti Recognins is for increasing the yield of other useful Chemoreciprocal products such as TAG, described below from a mammal which comprises injecting an immunologically effective dose of Recognin into the mammal, or other biological system. Prior to the present invention, glycoprotein complex were prepared from brain tissue and antibodies made to them. Separated materials known as lOB glycoproteins produced from Tay Sachss disease brain, were injected into rabbits and antibodies produced. These Tay Sachs antibodies were used in immunofluorescent studies of brain containing tumors only reactive normal non tumor glia, not tumor glia, were stained by these antibodies. In contrast, when Astrocytin was produced from tumor tissue, and antibodies to Astrocytin Anti Astrocytin were produced and employed in immunofluorescent studies of brain, only tumor glia, not normal non tumor glia, were stained by Anti Astrocytin. Thus, by tissue of origin and by nature of the anitbody, as well as by the specific type of cells stained, anti Tay Sachs antibodies and anti Astrocytin are clearly different products. pother class of Chemoreciprocals isfarget reagents V complexed with their chemoreciprocals. For example, the T arget product of Astrocytin complexed with a carrier such as bromoacetylcellulose is brought into contact with anti Atstrocytin. This type of compound may be complexed with an used for the delivery of diagnostic, nutritional and therapeutic agents to specific cells of sites in a biological system. These compounds may also be used for purification procedures. For example Anti Astrocytin may be made by the decomplexing of BromoacetylcelluloseAstrocytin Anti Astrocytin by hydrolytic treatment with an acid or proteinase enzyme.Target reagents are also useful for increasing the amount of TAG products described below in a biological system, such as by bringing an immunologically effective dose of Target into contact with bodily tissues or fluids. Additional Chemoreciprocals are TAG reagents i.e. Target Attaching Globulins . The TAG products are produced by bringing Target reagents into contact with body fluids for varying periods of time to form a complex and cleaving TAG therefrom. Two useful embodiments areS TAG and F TAG. A process for producing S TAG S low Target Attaching Globulin comprises reacting blood serum or other body fluid with Target e.g. Bromoacetylcellulose Malignin for approximately two hours or more at a low temperature, e.g. about 40C, and cleaving S TAG from the resulting material, e.g. with dilute acid for approximately two hours at a temperature of about 370C.The product S TAG prepared in accordance with this process is characterized by being soluble in aqueous buffered solutions, forming a single line precipitate with its corresponding Recognin in Ouchterlony gel diffusion test, being non dialyzable in cellophane membranes, being retained by millipore filters which retain molecules over 25,000 molecular weight having molecular weights in different states of aggregation as determined by thin layer gel chromato grahy of approximately sb,66o, and multiplies thereof into the macroglobulin range and having a spectrophoto meterabsorption peak wave length of 280 m. A process for producing F TAG Fast Target AttachingGlobulin comprises reacting blood serum or other body fluid with Target e.g. Bromoacetylcellulose Malignin for approximately 10 minutes at a low temperature, e.g.about40C, and cleaving F TAG from the resulting material, e.g. with dilute acid for approximately two hours at a temperature of about 370C. The product F TAG prepared in accordance with this process is characterized by being soluble in aqueous buffered solutions, forming a single line precipitate with its corresponding Recognin inOuchertlony gel diffusion tests, being non dialyzable in cellophane membranes, being reatained by millipore filters which retain molecules over 25,000 molecular weight, having molecular weights in different states of aggregation as determined by thin layer gel chromatography of approximately 50,000, and multiples thereof into the macroglobulin range and having a spectrophotometer absorption peak wave length of 280 mp. TAG products are useful for detecting cancer tumors in living mammals by determining the concentration ofS TAG and F TAG produced by a known volume of the mammaltSss5 blood serum or other body fluid and correlating this concentration with amounts determined to be indicative of cancer. TAG products are also useful for diagnosing the presence of tumor cells in a histology section and other cell collections, which comprises applying TAG conjugated with a labeling substance such as dyes and radioactive substances, to said section, whereby staining or radioactive labeling occurs only with tumor cells. TAG products additionally have been found to be cytotoxic to tumor cells.TAG products are also useful for directing the delivery of diagnostic, nutritional and therapeutic agents to specific cells or sites by introducing said agents iiiocomplesed form with .the TAG product. Accordingly the present invention provides a process for detecting the presence of cancerous or malignant tumor cells in a cell collection which comprises applying an anti malignin TAG product attached to visible or signal emitting means to said cell collection, whereby said anti malignin TAG product preferentially attaches to cancerous or malignant cells, and detecting said cancerous or malignant tumor cells by means of said visible or signal emitting means. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a process for detecting the presence of cancerous or malignant tumor cells in a cell collection which comprises applying to said cell collection an antimalignin TAG product, thereafter applying fluoresceinconjugated anti TAG thereto wherein fluorescence occurs only in the cancerous or malignant tumor cells upon illumination. The process of the present invention is applicable to both in vivo and in vitro cell collections. and also to the detection of both glial and non glial tumor cells.Advantageously, the TAG product used in the process of the present invention is produced by the reaction of anti malignin serum with a malignin based reagent, preferably bromoacetylcellulose malignin. It is preferred that the TAG product used in the process of the present invention be at least partially freed of substances which are less or non reactive in fluorescent detection, when applied to known cancerous cells, and that if a signal emitting means is used, then it is a radioisotope. Normal cell division in plants or animals is restricted or inhibited when the cells come to occupy fully a particular space. The mechanisms a by which normal t lls recognize that they have Rilled the space abailable to them and Xb by which the operation of this recognition mechanism in turn inhibits cell division, have both been unknown. The inventor has produced a group of compounds termed recognins whose precursors are increased in concentration when normal recognition and learning occur, and which relate to recognition and learning particles and cells, and with the connection of cells to each other.By attempting to produce these compounds from normal cancer cells, it has been discovered that they are absent as such, and that changes in their molecular structure have occurred at the same time that the cancer cells have lost their ability a to recognize that they have filled their normal bolume, and or b to stop dividing when they have filled their normal volume. Recognins are compounds which have physicochemical characteristics which mimic those configurations characteristic of cancer cells in terms of their failure to recognize and stop cell division. Recgnins are useful for providing immediate products and methods which are themselves useful in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and for its prevention. Methods have also been discovered by which artificially cultured cells can be used to produceMALIGNIN for the first time. One advantage of the methods disclosed herein is that MALIGNINS and new products from them can now be manufactured efficiently in virtually limitless quantities. The present invention applicable to any and all biological systems in which it is desired to influence all growth and metabolism. Thus by the manufacture of the particular compound or compounds of appropriate cell type in artificial culture, and the further manufacture of products from these substances, specific influence may for the first time be brought ts bear on any tissue, cell cell organelle, sub organelle molecule or molecular aggregate in any liviog system. Thus specific nutritional influences at critical times in development, specific diagnostic, preventative and treatment methods, and the construction of artificial bioelectrical systems as in tissue or organ trÃansplants can all be affected.These artificial bioelectrical systems can now be made to bear the characteristics of the specific Recognin, alignin or their chemoreciprocals of the normal tissue or component which they will neighbour and thus avoid being recognized as foreign and thus avoid the reactions to alien substances, including rejection. An aspect of this invention is the production from biological fluids of two new products, TARGET ATTACHING GLOBULINS TAG which are so named because they are produced by two reactions, the first reacting biological fluids with a synthetic complex containing physicochemical configurations which mimic those of the Malignins and which are called TARGET, the second, cleaving the specificTAG from the complex, and by the measure of the TAG so produced obtaining a quantitative indication from the biological fluids of living organisms whether there is present a tumor in that organism hence a diagnostic test for tumors. Because TAG products and anti Malignin are physicochemically complimentary to Malignins, they are termed Chemoreciprocals. It has further been discovered that two quantitatively and qualitatively distinct TAG products can be produced depending upon the time permitted for the reaction of serum with the specific Target reagent used, and ,depending upon the time permitted for the cleavage of the product which has been complexed. After examining the amounts of these products which could be produced from a number of different individuals with brain tumors and various other medical disorders, as well as in those with no apparent disease process, it became aSRarent that the amounts of these two new products which could be produced i pi a given individual was in 8iicative of whether that individual had a brain tumor, hence a serum diagnostic test for brain tumors. The utility of these new products, in addition to their use to diagnose from serum and other biological fluids the presence of brain and other tumors, is illustrated by the demonstration that TAG and antiRecognin compounds attach to glial andnon glial tumor cells preferentially in cell co llections, e.g. histological sections of for example brain tumor and surrounding tissue removed at surgery of the brain tumor. This preferential labelling by TAG and Anti RECOGNINS of tumor cells is demonstrated for example through standard immunofluorescent techniques although signal emitting means may also be used.Thus a new method is also available for determining through cell collection examination with a new degree of certainty whether tumor cells are present in the tissue removed, and whether these tumor cells have penetrated to the very edges of the tissue removed indicating the likelihood that tumor still remains in the brain or other organ, or that tumor cells are absent from the periphery of the tissue removed, indicating the possibility that all of the tumor has been removed from the brain or other organ. In addition,TAG and Anti malignins produced as described have been found to be cytotoxic for lioma brain tumor cells grown in tissue culture in vitro. This high affinity for tumor cells in another medium, here grown in tissue culture, is further evidence of the spec Lfic coupling potential of the new product TAG.Further, the cytotoxicity of TAG and anti RECOGNIN S for tumor cells provides an additional new diagnostic test for serum of patients who are supsected of suffering from a tumor.Thus, for example, the serum or other body fluid of these patients is reacted with Target to produce TAG and the product TAG is tested in tissue culture growths of tumor cells for cytotoxic ty. tBoth the concentration of TAG and the degree of cytotoxicity manifested by the TAG which can be produced from a given individual s serum may be not only diagnostic but also of value in tracing the course of the disorder preoperatively and postoperatively in a given patient. Coupling of radioactive and dye tracers to TAG provides new TAG products which are useful for example i vivo in the diagnosis of tumors and in their exact localization.Thus for example the injection of suitably labelled TAG either intraarterially or intravenously, into the cerebrosphinal fluid, or directly into brain tissue or its cavities, permits the demon stration by means such as radioactive means, or by visualization of the coupled dye, of the presence of a brain tumor, for it is only to the tumor cells that theTAG specifically attaches. Further, this method permits the precise visualization of the location of the brain tumor. Similar methods may be used for other types of tumor. This can be seen to be an improvement of this in vivo diagnostic method using anti ASTROCYTIN produced in rabbit blood to label the brain tumor, because the use of TAG produced from human serum avoids the possibility of foreign protein reactions.Since TAG and anti RECOGNINS have the chemical specificity which permits preferential attachment to ASTROCYTIN precursor containing tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, these products may also be used therapeutically, as well as diagnostically, when coupled, e.g., with radioactive, proton capture agents, or other toxic physical or chemical agents, so that these toxic substances may be localized preferentially through these compounds specificity of attachment in the tumor cells as compared to their neighbouring normal cells. This selectivity is universal t recognized as the crucial, or at least one crucial factor for achieving effective chemical or physical therapy of tumors. Thus TAG has demonstrated efficiency in attaching preferentially to the tumor cells, and should have promise as a new therapeutic product for these reasons. In the serum of patients with malignant tumors1 as will be seen in the examples below, one type of TAG,SLOW TAG S TAG as distinguished from Fast Tag F TAG can be produced in relatively greater amounts from a given volume of serum than in patients without such tumors.This suggests that either one of TAG s naturally occuring precursors P TAG is increased in concentarion or that other factors exist which favour the relative in vitro production of S TAG over F TAG. The possible relationship of the function of the actual synthetic products TARGET and TAG their precursors, and in turn to functions of postulated but not demonstrated cell antigens and circulating antibodies to them which may exist in vivo has yet to be elucidated. Thus for example, in antibody like fashion,F TAG and S TAG produce single discrete lines of reaction with strocytin in Ouchterlony gel diffusion, and the injection of TARGET in rabbits induces an increase in the yield of TAG products from rabbit serum after reacting with Target. The finding that there may be a normal level of a precursor resembling circulating antibody to a cell antigen which is hidden in the nondividing cell raises a question as to the possible function of the pair.It is here proposed that TAG precursor P TAG and TARGET lie substances exist in vivo which function in the control of cell proliferation and cell death. Thus, for example, the exposure of a cell constituent which normally is not directly exposed to serum proteins may occur during cell division. The expo sure of this cell constituent could result in that constituent becoming convert wed to a TARGET like substance to which the attachment of a P TAG like molecules from serum may then occur, which would stimulate cell division or iiihibit it.Alternatively, a non livEding cell which is injured or malfunctioning may expose a TARGET like substance to which the attachment of P TAG like molecules may be reparative. However, under certain cell conditions the attachment of P TAGlike molecules may induce the destruction of the cell e.g. ANTI GLIOMA TAG synthetically produced as here described is markedly cytotoxic to glioma tumor cells growing in tissue culture . This could thus represent a mirror of a normal mechanism for the control of cell division, and for either the repair or the removal of individual cells in the body throughout the life of the organism.If theexposure of cell constituents is abnormally increased so that abnormally large amounts of cell TARGET like substances are formed, as may occur in rapidly dividing cancer cells such as in brain gliomas, an increase in the concentration of zone type of serum P TAG relative to another may be induced. Whatever the actual function of the precursors, the increase in the relative amount of predominately one type of TAG, SLOW TAG S TAG which can be produced in vitro by the methods here described from the serum of patients with malignant tumors is the basis of the serum diagnostic test described in the examples which follow. The following examples illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE Production of Crude ASTROCYTIN Precursor Containing Fraction. Human brain glioma tumor tissue, removed at surgery, is dissected free as possible of surface blood vessels and mormal brain tissue. For a typical amount of dissected tumor tissue of 11 grams, the tissue is weighed into six 1.5 g. and two loo g aliquots. Sach aliquot is ien treated as follows. Each aliquot is homogenized in neutral buffer solution by sonification or other mechanical means. For example, each aliquot is homogenized in 100 cc per g of tissue of 0.005 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7, in a Waring blender. Homogenization should be done in the cold to prevent denaturation of proteins. For example, the blender should be precooled in a cold room at 0 50C and operated for about only three minutes. The homogenate is then centrifuged for clarification, for example at 80,000 times gravity for 30 minutes in a refrigerated ultracentrifuge. The soluble supernatant is decanted and kept in the cold. The incoluble residue is rehomogenized with a further 100 cc of neutral buffer and centrifuged as before, and the second soluble extract combined with the first. Best yields are obtained when this procedure of homogenization and centrifugation is repeated until less than 50 micrograms of protein per ml of solution are obtained in the supernate. With most tissues this is accomplished by the fifth extraction. The solutions thus obtained are combined and concentrated by perevaporation with subsequent dialysis, as by dialysis against 0.005 M phosphate buffer in the cold to produce a volume of 15 ml. The bolume of this solution is noted, an aliquot is taken for total protein analysis, and the remainder is fractionated to obtain the protein fraction having a pK range between 1 and 4.The preferred method of fractionation is chromatography as follows. The solution is fractionated in the cold room 40C on a DEAE cellulose Cellex D column 2.5 x 11.0 cm., which has been equilibrated with 0.005 N sodium phosphate buffer. Stepwise eluting solvent changes are made with the following solvents solutions Solution 1 4.Q4 g. NCaH2P04 and 6.50 g.Na2HP04 are dissolved ln 15 litred of distilled H2O o. 005 molar, pH 7 Solution 2 8.57 g. NaH PO s dissolved in 2480 ml of distilled H90 Solution 3 17.1 g of NaH2P04 is dissolved in 2480 ml of distilled H20, 0.05 molar, pH 4.7 Solution 4 59.65 g of ,NaH2P04 is dissolved in 2470 ml distilled HnO 0.175 molar Solution 5 101.6 g ofNaH2PO4 is dissolved in 2455 ml distilled 1129 0.yiolar, pH 4.3 Solution 6 340.2 g. of NaH2P04 is dissolved in 2465 ml of distilled H20 1.Q molar, pH 4.1 Solution 2 7 283.64 g of 80 phosphoric acid H3P04 is Md. up in 2460 ml of distilled H20 1.0 molar pH 1.0 . Add nervous tissue extract, 6 to 10 ml. volune.Let it pass in to column. The overlay with Solution 1 and attach a reservoir of 300 ml of Solution 1 to drip by gravity onto the column. Three ml aliquots of effluant are collected by means of an automatic fraction collector. The subsequent eluting solutions are exchanged stepwise at the following elution tube numbers.Solution 29 at tube 88, bring solution on column to top of resin, then overlay and attach reservoir of 50 ml of Solution 2 Solution 2 at tube 98 bring solution on column to top of resin, then overlay and attach reservoir of 75 ml of Solution 3 Solution 4 at tube 114, bring solution on column to top of resin, then overlay and attach reservoir of 150 ml of Solution 4 Solution 5 at tube 155, bring solution on column to top of resin, then overlay and attach reservoir of 125 ml of Solution 5 Solution 6 at tube 187, bring solution on column to top of resin, then overlay and attach reservoir of 175 ml of Solution 7 continue eluting until at tube 260, elution is complete. Use freshly prepared resin for every new volume of tissue extract. Each effluent tube is quantitatively analyzed for protein.The elutes in the tube numbers 212 to 230 are combined, and contain the crude productbbfi3m which ASTROCYTIN will be produced. While date has bey published on this crude material, called fraction 10B in the past, ProteinMetabolism of the Nervous System, pp. 555 69 Pleum Press, 1970 Journal of Neurosurgery, Vol. 33, pp. 281 281 286 September, 1970 the cleavage from fraction lOB of the specific product herein called ASTROCYTIN has now been accomplished. Crude fraction 10B can be prepared as a product in amounts between 0.1 and 10 mg per gm of original fresh nervous system tissue from which it was obtained.In addition to an ASTROCYTIN precursor it contains varying amounts of covalently bound carbohydrate residues including a number of hexoses, namely glucose, galatose, mannose hexosamines, including glucosamine, galatosamine and mannosamine and occasionally other sugars, such as fucose, ribose and perhaps rhamnose. It also contains large molecularweight protein products, several lipids and nucleic acids. EXAMPLE 2 Production of Purified ASTROCYTIN from Crude ASTROCYTIN Precursor Containing Fraction. The ASTROCYTIN Precursor Containing fraction is further isolated from contaminants. In the preferred embodiments, the material from Example 1 is chromatographed on Sephadex G 50 resin with a typical column of 40 cm. long, 2.5 cm diameter, and 196 ml volume. The pressure used is 40 mm Hg. the flow rate is 35 ml per hour, and the buffer is 0.05 molar phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.2. The first flow through peak containsASTROCYTIN Precursor together with impurities, whereas subsequentpeaks contain only impurities. In the preferred embodiment, the products in the above first flow through peak are then concentrated onSephadex G 15, then passed onto a column of Cellex D with the same solutions, 1 through 7 as Example 1, and the same elution steps as performed in Example 1. The product ASTROCYTIN is present as a sharp peak in the tubes numbers 212 230 as before, thus maintaining its beha tous on Cellex D chromatography without the presence of a large number of contaminants. Low molecular weight contaminants may then be removed by techniques known to the art, such as millipore disc filtration. In the preferred method, the productASTROCYTIN is freed of salt and other small molecular weight contaminants by filtration through MilliporePellicon Disc No. 1000, 13 mm, which retains substances of molecular weight greater than 1000 and permits to pass through those of molecular weight less than 1000.The product ASTROCYTIN remains on the Pellicon Disc, and is recovered from it by washing with Solution 1 ofExample 1. ASTROCYTIN is then obtained by isolating the compound having a molecular weight of about 8000 from the above solution. A preferred method uses thin layer gel TLG chromatograph as follows The apparatus used is the commercially szsilable one designed by Bochringer Mannheim GmbH Pharmacia FineChemicals and CAMAG Switzerland . The resin 2.5 g ofSephadex G 200 superfine is prepared in 85 ml of 0.5 M NaCl in 0.02 M. Na2HPO4EH2PO4 Phosphate Buffer ph 6.8 6.6 7.0 . Allow to swell two or three days at room temperature with occasional gentle mixing. Magnetic and other stirrers should not be used . The swollen gel is stabilized for three weeks at refrigerator temperature however, bacterial and fungal growth may interfere with the swollen gel.If the gel is to be kept for longer periods of time, a small amount of a bacteriostatic agent should be added sodium Azide 0.02ffi 2.5 g of dry gel are used to make two 20 x 20 cm glass plates of 0.5 mm thick. The plates are either allowed to dry at room temperature for 10 minuts and transferred to a moist chamber where they can be stored for about two weeks, or they are used immediately after appropriate pre equilibration. Usually during the night for a minimum of 12 hours . The main function of equilibration is to normalize the ratio between the stationary and mobile phase volumes.With the pre equilibrated plates in a horizontal position, substances to be determined are applied with micropipettes as spots or as a streak at the start line. 10 ml. to 20 ml of 0.2 2 protein solution is placed on the edge of a microscopic cover slide 18 x 18 m and held against the gel surface. In a few seconds the solution will soak into the gel. All samples are first prepared on the cover slides and then quickly applied. If not enought material is used, it is difficult to locate individual spots after separation. If too much material is applied no defined separation occurs.The samples are diluted with buffer for easier handling and the separation of samples is carried in a descending technique with the plate at an angle of 220c. The flow rate of about 1 2 cm hour is most suitable. Marker substances such as cytochrome C, haemoglobin, myoglobin or bromophenol Blue labeled albumin are applied at different positions across the plate to give a check on possible variation of flow across the plate and also to serve as reference proteins for calculation of relative distance mobility of unknowns. After application of samples, the plates are replaced in the apparatus and the paper wick pushed slightly downwards to ensure good contact with the gel layer. The paper wick must not drip. Excess moisture is wiped off. The liquid solvent in the reservoir is kept constant at 1 cm. from the upper end of the vessel. The runs are usually completed in 4 to 7 hours depending on the progress of separation. With coloured substances separation follows directly. The separated spots of protein are easily made visible by transferring them to a paper sheet replica of TLG plate after the chromatographic separation hasibeen completed, and by staining them on the prewashed methanol H20 acetic acid 90 5 5, for 48 hours.The paper sheet is 3mm filter paper. A sheet of paper 20 x 18 cm is placed over the gel layer and pressed rolled just enough to ensure contact with the gel.Care is taken not to trap air under the paper replica and not to disturb the gel layer. The liquid phrase is soaked off from the gel layer by the paper and removed after about one minute, immediately dried in an oven at a 600C temperature for 15 minutes and stained in the normal way with any of the routine staining procedures.Staining. is performed by spraying the replica paper with 0.03 diazotized sulfanilic acid in 10 Sodium Carbonate Pauley s Reagent . Staining can also be accomplished, with a saturated solution of Amido Black in MethanolAcetic Acid 90 lOv v is used the staining tine is 5 10 minutes. For destaining, rinse with two volumes of the 90 10 methanol and acetic acid solution mixed with one volume of H20 It is difficult to obtain low background staining without very extensive washing. The plates themselves may also be dried at about 60 C in an oven with air circulation but only if the ASTROCYTIN is to be stained. For isolation purposes, the plate should only be air dried at room temperature. Overheating can lead to cracking, but this can usually be avoided with at 500C 600C temperature which dries a sephadex G 200 plate in 15 30 minutes. The dry plates are allowed to swell for 10 minutes in a mixture of methanol H20 acetic acid 75 20 5 and stained in a saturated Amido Black in the same solvent system for five hours and subsequently washed by bathing for two hours in the same solvent before they are dried. For molecular eight determinations the distance from the starting line to the middle of each zone is measured with an accuracy of 0.05 mm either directly on the print replica or on the densitogram.The result is expressed by the Rm value defined as the ratio of the migration distance of the tested protein dp to that of cytochrome C or myoglobin dm which is used as the reference protein Relating migration distance of tested substance to standard is the formula R P A straight calibration line is obtained dm by plotting the logarithm of the molecular weight of the standards used against the Rm From this line the molecular weight of the unknown protein can be obtained.For most exact results six equal parts of the protein sample solution with standard, in this case, CytochromeC, before applying to the plate. By the above TLG procedure the product ASTROCYTIN is observed as a dis crete spot at a distance of approximately 0.83 0.02 with reference to the standard Cytochrome C, yielding an approximate molecular weight of 8000 for ASTROCYTIN.Several discrete products are separated in this procedure from ASTROCYTIN on the basis of slight differences in chemical structure and large differences in molecular weight. Thus, three products carried as contaminants to this point with molecular weight of approximately 64,000, 148,000 and 230,000, and one occasionally of molecular weight 32,000, have been detected and removed by the TLG methods described above. The product isASTROCYTIN is aspirated with the gel in which it is contained, in dry form, dissolved in Solution 1 and freed of resin by centrifugation or other similar means. The product ASTROCYTIN which has been produced at this stage is soluble in distilled water, soluble at neutral and acid pH, and insoluble at alkaline pH and has a spectrophotometric absorption peak wavelength of 280 m u It is a polypeptide with molecular weight, as stated above of approximately 8000.Its covalently linked amino acids are shown by hydrolysis with 6N HC1 then quantitative automatic determination to have the following average composition of amino acids Approximate Number of residues Aspartie acid 9 Thre onine 5 Serine 6 Glutamic acid 13 Proline 4 Glycine 6 Alanine 9 Valine 4 1 2 Cystine 2 Methionine 1 Isoleucine 2 Leuc ine 8 Tyrosine 2 Phenylalanine 3 Lysine 8 Histidine 2 Arginine 4 Approximate Total 88Cysteic acid, hydroxyproline, norleucine, ammonia, isodesmosine, desmosine, hydroxylysine, lysinonorleucine and gamma aminobutyric acid are all absent in detectable amounts, but a trace of glucosamine may be present. From 11 grams of the starting brain tumor tissue inExample 1, approximately 3 mg. of purified ASTROCYTIN is produced by the above methods. EXAMPLE 3 PRODUCTION OF REELER RECOGNIN Reeler disease is a genetic disorder in which animals fail to achieve stable coordinated motor activity, producing a reeling state, due to failure of migration of certain nerve cells to a particular place in the brain, the cerebellum, at a particular developmental time.Particular glial cells have been shown, in electron microssahpic studies, two provide the vertical pole like axes along which the nerve cells migrate to their new positions in the normal state. The failure of nerve cells to climb these glial fibers , in Reeler disease is thought to be due to some disturbance in the nerve cells or the glia or both. Following the methods of Examples 1 and 2, Recognin from mouse reeler brain was produced and compared withRecognin produced from normal mouse brain. The molecular weight of the Recognin produced from all areas of normal mouse brain was 8,000. The molecular weight of Reeler Recognin was 3,600 to 5,0or Reeler Recognin is abnormal, as shown by its much smaller molecular weight. Furthermore, the amount of Recognin which can be produced from the cerebellum of reeler mouse brain is much reduced when compared to the normal. This is shown in Table I. TABLE I Recognin Concentration in Mouse Brain, mg g. Normal ReelerCerebellum 16 day old mouse 2.50 0.71Cortex 16 day old mouse 0.60 0.96Cortex 4 day old mouse 0.29 0.53Brainstem 16 day old mouse 0.90 1.64Whole Brain 17 day old mouse . 1.27 1.53Whole Brain, l day old mouse 5.00, 5.86 Table I shows that while there is a marked decrease in the concentration of Recognin in cerebellum of Reeler mouse, there are the same or greater amounts of Recognins in other areas of the brain. The Recognin may not move from the other areas of brain to the cerebellum, or the.slight increase in other areas of Reeler brain may reflect some compensatory action. This pathological Recognin in Reeler brain is correlated with the inability for migrating brain cells to make the contacts they must in order to achieve proper placement, confirming the role of RECOGNINS in recognintion and learning in cells. By analogy the ANTI RECOGNINS to Recognin produced from mouse reeler brain may be produced and used in mice in a manner similar to the uses of ANTI ASTROCYTIN and ANTI AMALIGNIN, as described herein. EXAMPLE LE 4 Production of 5ALIGNIN Precursor in Artificial CancerCell Culture. Generally, sterile technique is scrupulously maintained. All solution e.g. Hanks Balanced Salt BSS , F 10 Nutrient medium, fetal calf serum, trypsin solution are incubated at about 350C in a water bath for approximately 20 minutes or more before use. Cells are removed from tumor tissue and grown in vitro for many generations using a suitable medium, such as described below. Pre rinse beakers to be used with a sterilizing solution, for example 12 proponal plus Amphyl or creolin solution. In the preferred embodiment, the artificial cancer cells i.e., cells grown in vitro for many generations are grown in 250 ml flasks. The liquid medium in which the cells are growing is discharged into the pre rinsed beakers. The cells are then washed gently with 5 10 ml of Hanks BSS or other similar solution for about 30 seconds. Aboid agitation. All walls and surfaces are washed. The solution is clarified of cells by centrifugation in the cold from 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm.The medium is poured into a beaker as above. Add a small amount of buffered proteinase enzyme solution and rinse quickly to avoid digestion of the cells. In the preferred method, 1 2 ml of trypsin solution EDTA is added and rinsed for only 10 seconds. Pour off the trypsin solution. Add a similar volume of fresh trypsin solution and incubate until the cells are seen to be separated from the walls of the chambers through microscopic observation. This usually requires 5 10 minutes. Add a suitable growth medium, such as 50 ml of a solution of 7 10 per cent solution of foetal calf serum in 100 ml of F 10 Nutrient medium. Twenty five ml of the fresh medium with cells is transferred to a new growth chamber for propagation and the remaining 25 ml is kept in the first chamber for propagation. Both chambers are placed in an incubator at 350C for approximately seven days. By the procedure of this Example to this point, an artificial cancer cell culture is divided into two fresh cultures approximately every seven days. This entire procedure may be repeated as often as desired, at approximately seven day intervals, for each growth chamber. Thus, the number of cells growing in vitro may be doubled approximately every seven days. The cells may be extracted for the production of MALIGNIN after approximately seven days of growth. For example, cells growing in each 250 ml growth chamber as described above, may be recovered as follows. The medium is transferred to a centrifuge tube and centriguged at 3,000 rpm in the cold for 10 minutes, The medium is discarded. The cells remaining in the growth chamber are scraped from the chamber walls and washed into the centrifuge tubes with neutral buffer solution. The cells are washed twice with neutral buffer solution, ceiitrifuged again at 3,000 rpm in the cold, and the medium is discarded. The washed cells are suspended in 10 ml. of neutral phosphate buffer until ready for extraction of crude, iALIGNIN Precursor Containing fraction. ELOSLE 5 Production of Crude MAllGNIN Precurs or Containing 5 Fraction. Washed cells suspended in neutral buffer fromEXAMPLE 3 are mechanically disrupted under conditions which avoid denaturation of most proteins. In the preferred method, the washed cells are treated in the cold.with a sonifier for 20 seconds. After sonification the cell residues are, centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 30 minutes and the supernatant decanted.Ten ml aliquots of buffer solution are used to wash remaining cells from the chamber and these are added to the remaining cell residues. Sonify and centrifuge as above and combine the supernatants. Repeat the process once more. The combined supernatant is prevaporated to reduce the approximate 30 ml volume to about 6 7 ml. An aliquot is taken for total protein analysis and the remainder is fractionated according to the methods ofEXAMPLE 1 for ASTROCYTIN Precursor. EXAMPLE 6 Production of Purified MALIGNIN Product from Crude MA LIGNIN c ontaining Fraction. The product MALIGNIN is further isolated from contaminants by the methods of EXAMPLE 2 for ASTROCYTIN. In the TIG step of the preferred embodiment, the product MALIGNIN is observed as a discrete spot at a distance of approximately 0.91 0.02 with reference to the standard cytochrome C, yielding an approximate molecular weight of 10,000 for MALIGNIN. The product MALIGNIN which has been produced at this stage is soluble in distilled water, soluble at neutral or aoid pli, and insoluble at alkaline pH and having a spectrophotometric absorption peak of 280 mu. It is a polypeptide with molecular weight of approximately 10,000. The molecular weights of MALIGNIN produced in fermentation cultures stabilized in successive generations of the cultures as shown by the thin layer gel chromatography determinations are set forth in Table II. The reproductivity of the molecular weight determinations is remarkable in view of the inherent limitations of TLG chromatography.

A typical yield of pure MALIGNIN from twelve 250 ml reaction chambers of EXAMPLE 4 together is approximately lmg of MALIGNIN. The unique structures of MALIGNIN and ASTROCYTIN were confirmed by an exhaustive computerized search which compared their compositions with virtually all known protein substances. The amino acid composition of MALIGNIN and ASTROCYTIN, their absolute and relative amounts of each amino acid component in terms of the total number of amino acid residues per mole, and their absolute and relative amounts of each amino acid component in terms of the molecular weight of the molecule, were submitted to matrix computer analysis against the largest known library of protein structure in the world, that of the NationalBiomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D.C. No structure identical to or even very close to that of ASTRÃCYTIN or MALIGNIN was found in the matrix analysis comparison with several hundred thousand proteins and protein fragments. The only proteins that were structurally related in any ivy are shown in Table III with their individual amino composition and molecular weights for comparison.The computer is programmed to identify, from the several hundred thousand possibilities, and degree of similarity in structure. Thus, for example, proteins molecular weight much larger or smaller will not match, nor those withless than 85 or greater than 95 residues, nor those with less than 6 or greater than 11 aspartic residues, and so on for each of the twenty amino acids involved.

Some substances will match on one, on four or on five variables but none match on all 22.In fact, none match in better than 14 variables leaving differences in 8 variables. Thus, the closest fit is cytochrome b human .As seen in Table III, the alanine, argine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, methionine and tyrosine and tryptophane residue numbers all differ appreciably to markedly from Astrocytin and from Malignin.Because cytochrome b5 contains 7 histidines whileAstrocytin and Malignin contain only 2, they could not possibly have the same chemical structure. The most unusual thing about the composition ofAstrocytin and Malignin is the high concentration of glutamic acid. One would expect to find only 5 or 6 residues in 89. Other next closest fits are the ferrodoxins of leucaene glauca and of alfalfa, respectively, but these also differ markedly in four and six amino acids, respectively and appreciably in two others, and in having 96 and 97 residues, respectively. The nextclosests fit is the acylcarrier protein of E. Coli 26, but this also differs markedly in eleven amino acids from Malignin and Astrocytin, and has only 77 residues. Some other brain proteins neurophysin, bovine and pig and gonadotropin releasing hormone are listed inTable III to illustrate how much worse the match is for the remaining several hundred thousand protein fragments in the computer memory. bank. Respiratory proteins may contain metals and or heme components in their in situ state, but the isolated protein fragment, e.g., for apocytochrome b5 contains neither. Additional microanalysis of Astrocytin andMalignin has shown them to be free of iron, sulfur, phosphorus and magnesium all less than 0.01 , and the spectral characteristics show typical absorption at 280 mu. Upon recotmbination of heme with apoprotein, the typical absorption spectra between 400 and 450 m are restored. Despite the structural uniqueness of Astrocytin andMalignin from all other proteins and protein fragments, it is noteworthy and perhaps of great improtance, that the closest structures are those of respiratory proteins.It is well known to the art that many important relationships can be drawn from both a developmental genetic point of view and from a functional point of view in the type of structure represented. If Astrocytin and Malignin are new protein products whose in situ structural. equivalents represent respiratory functions,, and these proteins relate as is now shown to malignancy., then an opening has been found to solve one of the great puzzles of cancer that is, how are the energetcis satisfied for these voracious, rapidly reproducing malignant cells Aside from the theoretical importance of this discovery, the data above on the increase in the percentage of Malignin in more malignant cells, and the data provided below indicating that Anti Malignin not only attaches toMalignin like chemical groupings of the cancer cell, but having so attached is cytotoxic to the cells, come together meaningfully, If the Malignin like in situ compounds in cancer cells are respiratory proteins, since the Anti Malignin products of this invention attach preferentially to these in situ compounds, then if functional respiratory groups are involved in this attachement, it is easy to understand how this results in death of the cancer cells. The therapeutic possibilities for the Anti Malignins, and other similar chemoreciprocals, are greatly strength ened by this structural information on Malignin and Astrocytin, as well as on the demonstrated relationship of the amount of Malignin to the degree of malignancy. EXA 2LE 7 Demonstration of increased yield, degree of mal ignancy, and proportion of Malignin, by provision of greater volume and surface area during fermentation. Examples 3 through 5 were repeated using 1000 cc. flasks instead of 250 cc flasks. All quantities of reagents were increased threefold. The yield of the product MALIGNIN after 7 days growth of inoculum was increased almost twofold by increasing the space available for malignant cell growth from 250 cc to 1000 cc. Table IV shows the yield of total protein in mg. and the iALIGNIN produced as a percentage of aid total protein for successive generations of fermenation cultures in each size flask. Using 250 cc flasks, the mean total protein produced was 17.5 mg. Using 1000 cc flasks, the mean total protein produced was 40.4 mg. Suprisingly, as the amount of malignant cell growth degree of malignancy was increased per seven dÃay growth period by providing greater space and surface for cell growth, the amount of MALIGNIN produced, as a percentage of the total protein, increased signinficantly. The percentage of total protein which is MALIGNIN increased from a mean of 10.7 percent using 250 cc flasks to a mean of 28.3 percent using 1000 cc flasks for a constant growth period of seven days. The relationship between the proportion of MALIGNIN produced, and the degree of malignancy i.e., as a function of the amount of malignant cell growth in vitro in seven days, measured as total protein produced is shown in Fig. I.

Fig I also demonstrates a relationship between MAllGNIN and malignancy. The interrupted line represents and ideal linear relationship. This demonstrated relation ship is clearly not trivial since the proportion of tALIGNIN present increases as the cells bcome more unrestrained pathological in their growth. The normal in situ Recognin function relates, as previously stated, to the contact inhibition of growth of cells. The more pathological the growth of the malignant cells, the less contact inhibition operates, and.the more MALIGNIN becomes the predominant protein. Example 5A demonstrates that growth of artificial cancer cell culture in large size growth containers unexpectedly results in increased proportion of MALIGNIN produced, that is, in an increase in the percentage of totl protein produced which is 1ALIGNIN. As used in this application a large size growth container means one in which the ratio of the container volume to the volume of total medium with cells utilized in accordance with the methods of Example 3 is greater than about 8 1, for example, 7 1 to 10 1. Example 5A illustrates a ratio of about 8 1. EXAMPLE 8 Production of TARGET Reagents fromRECOGNINS. ASTROCYTIN, prepared as in EXAMPLE 2 above, or MALIGNIN, prepared as in EXAMPLE 5 above, is complexed with a carrier to produce TARGET reagent. In the preferred embodiment, ASTROCYTIN or MALIGNIN is dissolved in 0.15 WNaH2P04 citrate buffer, pH 4.0.A bromoacetyl resin, for example bromoacetylcellulose BAC having 1.0 to 1.5 milliequivalents Br per gram of cellulose, stored in the cold, is prepared in 0.15 M NaH2P04 buffer, pH 7.2. Convert tfr e buffer to pH4 by pouring off the pH 7.2 buffer solution and adding 0.15 M NaH2P04 citrate buffer, pH 4.0. The ASTROCYTIN or MALIGNIN solution and the BAC solution are stirred together 10 1 BAC to RECOGNIN ratio for 30 hours at room temperature, then centrifuged. It is preferred that all sites on the BAC which are available to bind to RECOGNIN be bound. This may be accomplished as follows. The supernatant from the immediately preceding step is lyophilized and the protein content determined to indicate the amount of ASTROCYTIN or MALIGNIN not yet complexed to BAC. The complexed BAC ASTROCYTIN or BAC ALIGNINO is resuspended in o.l M bicarbonate buffer pH 8.9, stirred 24 hours at 40 to permit the formation of chemical bonds between the BAC and the ASTROCYTIN or MALIGNIN. After the 24 hours, the suspension is centrifuged and supernatant analyzed for protein.The complexed BAC ASTROCYTIN or BAC 4LIGNIN is now resuspended in 0.05 M aminoethanol 0.1 u bicarbonate buffer rll 8.9 in order. to block any unreacted broÃ§ine. The suspension is centrifuged and the supernatant is kept but not analysed because of the preSence of aminoethanol. Removal of all unbound ASTROCYTIN or MALIGNIN is then accomplished by centrifugation and resuspension for three washings in 0.15 M NaCl until no absorbance is measured on the spectrophotometer at 266 m. The BAC ASTROCYTING or BAC MAllGNIN complex is now stirred in 8 M urea for 2 hours at 380C, centrifuged, then washed three times usually suffices with 8 M urea until no absorbance is shown in the washings at 266 m. The complex is then washed with 0.15 M NaCl two timesto rid of urea. The complex is then stirred at 370C in 0.25 M. acetic acid for 2 hours to demonstrate its stability. Centrifuge and read supernatant at 266 mM no absorb ance should be present. This chemically complexed BAC ASTROCYTIN or BAC MALIGNIN is therefore stable and can now be used as a reagent in the methods described below in this stable reagent form it is referred to as TARGET TOPOGRAPHIC ANTIGEN LIKE REAGENT TEMPLATE because it is a synthetically produced complex whose physical and chemical properties mimic the stable cell bound precursor of ASTROCYTIN or MALIGNIN when it isin a potential reactive state with serum components. For storing, TARGET reagent is centrifuged and washed until neutralised with 0.15 M NaH2PO4 buffer pH 7.2. TARGET reagents may be prepared from bromoacetyl liganded carriers other than cellulose, such as bromoacetylated resins or even filter paper. EXAMPLE 9 Production of antisera to Astrocytin, Malignin and TARGET. Antisera to Astrocytin, Malignin or TARGET reagents may be produced by inducing an antibody response in a mamnal to them. The following procedure has been found to be satisfactory. One mg. Of REC6GNIN Astrocytin or Malignin is injected into the toe pads of white male rabbits with standard Freud s adjuvant, and then the same injection is made intraperitoneally one week later, again intraperitoneally ten days and, if necessary, three weeks later.Specific antibodies may be detected in the blood serum df these rabbits as early as one week to ten days after the first injection. The same procedure is followed forTARGET antigen by injecting that amount of TARGET which contains 1 mg of Astrocytin or Malignin as determined byFolin Lowry determination of protein. The specific antibody to Astrocytin is namedAnti Astrocytin. The specific antibody to Malignin is named Anti Malignin. Similarly, the specific antibody to TARGET reagent is named Anti Target. These antibodies show clearly on standard Ouchterlony gel diffusion test for antigen antibody reactions with specific single sharp reaction lines produced with their specific antigen. The presence of specific antibodies in serum can also be tested by the standard quantitative precipitin test for antigen antibody reactions. Good precipitin curves are obtained and the micrograms specific antibody can be calculated therefrom. Further evidence of the presence of specific antibodies in serum can be obtained by absorption of the specific antibody Anti Astrocytin onto Bromoacetylcellulose Astrocytin BAC Astrocytin prepared above.The antiserum containing specificAnti Astrocytin can be reacted with BAC Astrocytin. When the serum is passed over BAC Astrocytin only the specific antibodies toAstrocytin bind to their specific antigen Astrocytin.Since Astrocytin is covalently bound to Bromoacetyl cellulose the specific antibody, Anti Astrocytin, is now bound to BAC Astrocytin to produce BAC Astrocytin Anti Astrocytin BACA Anti Astrocytin . This is proved by testing the remainder of the serum which is washed free from BAC Astrocytin. On standard Ouchterlony diffusion no antibodies now remain in the serum which will react with Astrocytin. It is therefore concluded that all specific antibodies Anti Astrocytin previously shown to be present in the serum, have been absorbed toBAC Astrocytin. Furthermore, when Anti Astrocytin is released from its binding to BAC Astrocytin it is thereby isolated free of all contaminating antibodies.This release of Anti Astrocytin may be accomplished by washing the BAC Anti Astrocytin coupled with 0.25 M acetic acid 40C., 2 hours. which has been shown above not to break the BAC Astrocytin bond. Still further evidence of the presence of specific antibodies in serum can be obtained by absorption of the specific antibody Anti Malignin onto Bromoaceyl celluloseMalignin BAC Malignin prepared above. The antiserum containing specific Anti Malignin can be reacted withBAC Malignin. When the serum is passed over BAC Malignin only the specific antibodies to DIalignin bind to their specific antigen Malignin. Since Malignin is covalently bound to Bromoacetyl cellulose the specific antibody, Anti Malignin, is now bound to BAC Malignin to produce BAC Malignin Anti Malignin BACM Antii Malignin .This is proved by testing the remainder of the serum which is washed free from BAC Malignin. On standard Ouchterlony diffusion no antibodies now remain in the serum which will react with Malignin. It is therefore concluded that all specific antibodies Anti Malignin previously shown to be present in the serum, have been absorbed to BACMalignin. Furthermore, when Anti Malignin is released from its binding to BAC Malignin it is thereby isolated free of all contaminating antibodies, This release of tti Malignin may be accomplished by washing the BACMAnti Malignin complex with 0.25 M acetic acid 40C, 2 hours which hXas been shown above not to break theBAC Malignin bond. The antibodies to TARGET show clearly on standardOuchterlony gel diffusion test for antigen antibody reactions with specific single reaction lines produced withTARGET which show a line of identity with the line of reaction to ANTI ASTROCYTIN or ANTI MALIGNIN antisera i.e.that produced to the injection of ASTROCYTIN or MALIGNIN themselves . Some rabbits, it has been noted, have levels of ANTI TARGE in their blood prior to being injected with TARGET. These ANTI TARGET substances, when reacted specifically with TARGET reagent as to be described in tests of human sera, lead to the production of approximately equivalent amounts of the two types of TAG,S TAG and F TAG see later EXAtPLE,S . EXAMPLE 10 Detection of Malignant Tumors by QuantitativeProduction in vitro of TARGET ATTACHING GLOBULINS TAG from Bilogical Fluids. TARGET reagent prepared in accordance with EXAMPLE 6 is washed to remove any unbound RECOGNIN which may be present due to deterioration. The following procedure is satisfactory. TARGET reagent is stirred for two hours at 370C with acetic acid, centrifuged, the supernatant decanted, and the optical density of the supernatant read at 266 mp. If there is any absorbance, this wÃash is repeated until no further material is solubilized.The TARGET is then resuspended in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2. Standard S TAG and F TAG purified from previous reactions of human serum by the procedure described below can be uscd if available, as reference standards to test the TARGET reagent, as can whole rabbit serum which has been determined to contain S TAG and F TAG by other TARGET preparations . The Slow Binding S TAG determination is performed as follows Frozen serum stored niore than a few days should not be used. Serum is carefully prepared from freshly obtained whole blood or other body fluid by standard procedures in the art. The following procedure has been found to be satisfactory. Blood is allowed to elot by standing for 2 hours at room temperature in a glass test tube. The clots are separated from the walls with a glass stirring rod and the. blood allowed to stand at 40C for a minimum of 2 hours or overnight . The clots are separated from the serum by centrifuging at 20,000 rpm at 40C for 45 minutes. The serum is decanted into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged again at 2000 rpm at 40C for 45 minutes.The serum is decanted and a 10 Solution of Methiolate Ig in 95 ml water and 5 ml 0.2 M bicarbonate buffer pH 10 is added to the extent of 1 of the volume of serum. Serum samples, prepared by the above or other proz cedures, of 0.2 ml each are added to each of 0.25 ml aliquots of TARGET suspension reagent containing 100200 micrograms of RECOGNIN per 0.25 ml TARGET reagent, in duplicate determination. The suspension is mixed at 40C in a manner to avoid pellet formation. For example, a small rubber cap rapid shaken may be used for 1 2 seconds and then, with the tubes slightly slanted, they may be shaken in a Thomas shaker for about 2 hours or more. The TARGET reagent and protein bound to it are separated from the serum. One of the procedures which has been found to be satisfactory is the following. The tubes are then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 mintes at 48C, the supernatant decanted, the pellet which is formed by centrifugation washed 3 times by remixing and shaking at room temperature with 0.2 0.3 ml of 0.15 MSaline, centrifuged and the supernatants discarded. The protein which remains attached to the TARGET is cleaved therefrom and quantitatively determined. For example, 0.2 ml of 0.25 M acetic acid is added, the suspension shaken for 1 to 2 seconds with a rubber cup shaker, then in a Thomas shaker for about 2 hours in a 37 C incubator. The tubes are centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 40C for 30 minutes. The supernatant is carefully decanted to avoid transferring particles and the optical density of the supernatant is read at 280me. The value of the optical density is divided by a factor of 1.46 for results in micrograms per ml serum protein S TAG . Duplicate determinations should not vary more than 5,0. Any other procedure effective for determining protein content may be used, such as Folin Lowry determ ination, but standards must be specified to determine the range of control and tumor values of S TAG minus F TAG concentration. The Fast Binding F TAG determination is performed as follows Frozen serum stored more than a few days should not be used. Serum is careful prepared from freshly obtained whole blood or other body fluid by standard procedures in the art. The procedure given above in this EXAMPLE for serum preparation is satisfactory. Serum samples, prepared by the above or other procedures are allowed to stand at 40C for 10 minutes less than the total time the S TAG serum determinations were allowed to be in contact with TARGET reagent above e.g. 1 hour 50 minutes if a two hour S TAG determination was made . This procedure equilibrates the temperature histories of S TAG and F TAG determinations. Add 0.2 ml samples of the temperature equilibrated serum to each of 0.25 ml aliquots of TARGET suspension reagent containing 100 200 micrograms of RECOGNIN per 0.25 ml TARGET reagent, in duplicate determination.The suspension is then mixed at 40C for approximately 10 rjiutes in a manner to avoid pellet formation. For example, a small rubber cap rapid shaken may be used for 1 2 seconds and then, with the tubes slightly slanted, they may be shaken in a Thomas shaker for approximately 10 minutes. The TARGET reagent and protein bound to it are separated from the serum. One of the procedures which has been found to be satisfactory is the following. The tubes are then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 minutes at 40C, the supernatant decanted, the pellet which is formed by centrifugation washed 3 times by remixing and shaking at room temperature with 0.2 3.0 ml of 0.15 M Saline, centrifuged and the supernatants discarded. The protein which remains attached to the TARGET is cleaved therefrom and quantitatively determined.The procedure described above in this EXAMPLE for determining S TAG concentration is satisfactory. Any other procedure effective for determining protein content may be used, such as Folin Lowry determination, but standards must be specified to determine the range of control and tumor values of S TAG minus F TAG concentration. The final results are expressed as TAG micrograms per ml of Serum, and equal S TAG minus F TAG. TAG.values in non brain tumor patients and other controls currently range from zero or a negative number to 140 micrograms per ml of serum. TAG values in brain tumor patients currently range from 141 to 500 micrograms per ml of serum. In the first blind study of 50 blood samples conducted according to the procedures of thisEXAMPLE utilizing TARGET reagent prepared from Astrocytin and bromoacetylcellulose, 11 of 11 brain tumors and 28 of 32 normals were correctly identified. One of the 4 supposed normals i.e., non brain tumor controls turned out to have a cancer of the thyroid gland which had apparently been successfully treated some years before. The three remaining normals were individuals aged 6070 who were in poor health, possibly having non diagnosed cancer. Of tFe remaining 7 samples, three out of three cases of Hodgkin s Disease were correctly identified ,one sample inthe tumor range 141 500 ug TAG ml corresponded to a patient having a severe gliosis, and three samples in the non tumor range 0 140 ug TAG ml corresponded to patients having respectively, an intracranial mass diagnosis uncertain but non tumor, and osteosarcoma non brain tumor and a melanotic sarcoma non brain tumor . A subsequent study conducting according to the procedures of this example utilizing TARGET reagent prepared from MALIGNIN and bromoacetylcellulose correctly identified three out of three malignant brain tumors and all normals. A still further study conducted according to the procedures of this example extended the total number of human serum specimens tested from 50 to 114.The utility of these products and procedures is domonstrated in Table V which records the results of these tests.

EXAMPLE 11 5Diagnosis of Tumor Cells by Immunofluorescense The compounds Anti Astrocytin, Anti Malignin, andS TAG have been shown to attach preferentially to tumor cells. This specificity permits use of these compounds to diagnose tumor cells in histology sections by conjugating dyes or radioactive substances to AntiAstrocytin, Anti Malignin, or S TAG. Standard labeling techniques may then be used. A procedure using S TAG is as follows. One procedure which has been found satisfactory is a modified St Marie procedure. Human brain tumor specimens are frozen and 5 micron thick sections cut.These are stored in a moist container at minu 700C for 4 to 8 weeks before staining. The conjugate may be a standard antiserum such as goat anti rabbit conjugatesThe conjugate is labeled by techniques known in the art with fluorescien or other labeling substance. Fluorescein labeled goat anti rabbit conjugate as commercially available may be used. The fluorescent technique used was a standard one in which a 1 200 to 1 400 solution of TAG is incubated for about 30 minutes or more on the tumor section, followed by washes to remove unattachedTAG. Three washes with phosphate buffered saline has been found satisfactory. Conjugate incubation with fluorescein labeled conjugate followed by washes is then performed, followed by microscopic inspection.Normal cells and their processes fail to stain both the tumor sections and in control sections of normal non tumor brain. Fluorescence is brightly present in tumor glial cells and their processes. EXAMPLE 12 Detection of non brain malignant cells with fluorescent signal from TAG. The uses of TAG products coupled with a signal emitter such as a dye or a radioactive label to detect cancer cells is decribed herein. in this EXAMPLE, the detection ofvnon Brain malignant cells is described. As described in EXAMPLE 10 utilizing human serum in the determination of TAG, after the anti malignin antibody was bound to the immobilized antigen and nnnbound serum proteins washed away, the antibody was cloven from the binding with 0.25 M acetic acid at 370C for 2 hours and the TARGET reagent separated from it by centrifugation.The TAG antibody solution. was quantitated by means of its absorption at 280 m. The TAG solutions were stored at 200C, then thawed and combined, brought to pH 7 by titration with 6N NaOH, dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline pH 7, filtered and concentrated on Millipore Pellicon 1000 membranes, centrifuged to clear insoluble protein and the immune globulin complexes concentrated and freed of immunologically non active compounds by Cellex D and Blue Sepharose CL6B Pharmacia chromatography. This human anti malignin antibody reacts with anti human gamma globulin in Ouchterlony double diffusion.When TAG is used with fluorescein conjugated to anti human gamma globulin in standard double layer Coons immunofluorescence it stains malignant glia, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of colon, and other types of cancer cells in postoperative and biopsy tissue sections, as well as in human sputum, bronchial washings, pleural effusion fluid, gastric aspirate and bladder urine. The concentration of protein in TAG which yield clear fluorescence when controls are negative is 1 to 10 pg per section. The production of a purified TAG was undertaken by reacting the sera from patients with a variety of cancers with bromoacetylcellulose MALIGNIN by methods earlier described EXAMPLE 10 . The antibody bound in this reaction was cleaved with 0.25 M acetic acid, quantified by measurement at O.D. 280 using a conversion factor of 1.46 for gamma globulin, frozen and stored at 200C. This antibody was found to contain immuno globulin as determined by anti human gamma globulin antiserum specific for gamma chains BioRad Laboratories,Inc. and with anti FAB and anti Fe fragments Miles Laboratories . It also reacts with rabbit anti human albumin BioRad Laboratories . It was found that whereas 10 to 50 micrograms of protein TAG are required to produce specific immunofluorescent staining of cells which contain Malignin, only 1 to 10 micrograms of purified protein TAG are required for this specific staining in all sections, and in a few, less than one microgram has been found to suffice. It was found that the most active preparation of purified TAG is that which is eluted with the highest ionic strength elution, i.e., from 0.15 I to 1.5 M.Any method of production which uses this fact is useful three preferred methods are given below. Method I Fractionation of TAG by chromatography with DEAE cellulose Cellex D, BioRad Laboratories was first employed with step wise elution with increasing ionic strength and decreaseing pH, the same sequence of eluants as that given in Example I for the production ofCrude Astrocytin Precursor Containing Fraction. Good separation was obtained of the bulk of the protein into three fractions, Peak I obtained with Solution 1 seeExample 1 and Peak II obtained with Solution 6 andSolution 7. Ouchterlony double diffusion showed the TAG in Peak I still to contain appreciable protein with albumin mobility, and while Peak II contained most of the albumin, appreciable IgG could be detected.Rechromatography of Peak I gave a progressively pure IgG until, after the seventh chromatography, essentially no albumin s than 3 ,6 could be detected by Ouchterlony gel diffusion in whiCh 5 to 10 micrograms of human albumin was detectable with rabbit anti human albumin. The IgG so obtained was prone to denaturation and loss of immunological reactivity after a few days standing at O 50C. Method II A second fractionation of TAG was made with chromatography on Sepharose CL 6B Pharmacia,Inc starting with low molarity buffer 0.005 M phosphate and proceeding in two steps of 0.15 M and 1.5 M to elute the balance of the protein. As with the Cellex D, one passage was found to be inadequate to separate, and recycling slowly improved the product. Once again, the most active fraction vis a vis anti malignin antibody was in the 1.5 M fraction. method III Chromatography with Sepharose CL 6B next to the glass fritted disc and Cellex D layered above the Sepharose proved to be the most satisfactory method. The graphical representation in Fig. 2 shows the fractions obtained on chromatography of TAG utilizingMethod III. After the first eluate of 200 mls, 50 ml.or smaller sub fractions were collected. The protein context of each eluate was determined by the optical density at 280 mp with a uniform factor of 1.46 based on gamma globulin used to convert to micrograms for calculating recoveries. The absolute amount of protein requires correction in those fractions in which there is appreciable albumin. The points at which the stepwise solvent changes were made are indicated by arrows.The subfractions are designated by Roman Numerals I through VIII. The solvents corresponding to letters A F at the arrows were as follows ft A 0.01 M TRIS ph 7.2 B 0.05 M TRIS with 0.1M NaCl pH 7.2 C PBS, 0.11 M NaCl pH 7.2 D PBe, 0.I65 M NaCl pH 7.2 E PBS,. 0.33 M NaCl pH 7.2 F 0.05 M TRIS, 1.5 M NaC1 pH 7.2 In the following Table are shown the recoveries from each fraction, a semi quantitative determination in each of the gamma globulin and albumin in each, as well as the activity of each fraction in the immunofluorescent stainin of cancer cells.

In this Example, the feasibility of attaching a radioactive label to TAG is demonstrated. Second, the njection into animals of this radio labeled TAG has been accomplished and shown to be safe and effective. Third, the radio laveled TAG localized preferentially in the cancer tissue when compared to normal tissue, thus indicating that the specificty previously demonstrated in vitro of the preference for cancer cells which is conveyed by the use of specific anti Malignin TAG products is confirmed in vivo.The Labeling of TAG with 99m Technetium 99mTc Procedure for Labeling 1. Two preparations of TAG were used, here designated TAG 1 and TAG 2. TAG 1 and TAG 2 concentration of each 0.4 mg 0.5ml were added to separate sterile evacuated vials. 2. To each vial was added 0.1 ml of a stannous chloride solution 1O mg SnC1 2 H2O in 100 nil of 0.01 N HC. The vials were mixed for 3 4 minutes. 3. 0.1 ml 6mCi of 99 Tc pertechnetate sodium salt was added and mixed 2 3 minutes.Procedure for determining labelin effIciency Samples of the 99m Tc TAG l and 99m Tc TAG 2 were tested for labeling efficiency by descending paper chromatography using Watman No. 1 paper with 85 methanol as the solvent. A similar study was done with SodiumPertechnetate 99m TC which acted as a control. After 2 hours, the papers were removed from the chromatography tank and divided in two sections 1 1 cm about the origin 2 the remaining paer up to the solvent front. Each section was then counted in a gamma well scintillation counter and its content of radioactivity determined cpm . Approximately 50 lambda were plated on each paper strip.Procedure for Antigen Antibody Reaction A portion of the labeled solution was also plated on an Ouchterlony gel plate to determine its ability to react with malignin in the antigen antibody reaction.After a 3 hour period, the resulting sharp reactive lines were removed from the gel and their content of radioactivity measured. An equal portion of the gel not involved in the reaction was also removed and its content of radio activity was also measured as background.ResultsLabeling Efficiency TABLE 1 Laveling Efficiency of 99 Te TAG l and 99mTcwTAG 2 COMPOUND SITE ON PAPER CPM CHEMICAL SPECIES SaTcO4 Origin 4.94 X 105 7.33 reduced 99mTc TcO4 NaTcO4 Solvent front 6.25 X 106 92.67 Tc04 99mTcTAG l Origniii 4.35 X 106 98.47 TAG 99mTcTAG 1 Solvent front 6.76 X 104TAG 2 Origin 1.96 X 6 l.5y TcO4 TAG 2 Solvent front 3.98 X 104 1.99 TcO4 TABLE 2 ANTIGEN ANTIBODY RESECTIONGEL AREA COUNTS PER MINTAG 2 Line 1.99 X 106 92.04 Background gel 1.72 X 105 7. 96 Conclusions The following conclusions were reached relative to the quality control tests employed 1. 99m Tc peltechnetate was reduced by stannous chloride to a more reactive oxidation state 4 5 . 2. The reduced pertechnetate labeled both theTAG 1 and TAG 2 preparations. 3. The 99mTc TAG 2 was tested for its ability to retain its activity and was found to retain its ability to react immunologically.The Use of Radio Labeled TAG in vivo to Detect Cancer CelLs Wistar rats were injected intracerebrally withCisgliome tumor cells which had had previous passages in rats and in tissue culture. The rats were observed for the first signs of growing tumor, such as weakness, tremor or unsteadiness. These symptoms first appear seven to 10 days from injection, and with fast growing tumors result in death within three to four days in many animals, and one week in all. As soon as symptoms appeared, the animals were injected with labeled TAG intravenously in the tail vein, then the animal anesthetized at vat7ingimes, the brain removed, the tumor dissected free of normal brain, and the radioaetivity in each dissected specimen compared.Preliminary 99mTc TAG experiment Counts gm minAnimal hr post Sacrifice Tumor mg Tumor Normal hr post injection wt, mg Brain A 1.25 1.9 149,100 13,400 B 5.30 6.0 16,200 6,600 C 7.21 23.0 53,000 5.800 D 24.10 29.0 66,700 7,50O Tumor and normal brain specimens were counted overnight in the gamma well counter. All samples and standards were decay corrected for convenience to the midcount of the first sample in the sequence.Conclusion The preferential localization of radioactiyity in tumor as compared to normal tissue is demonstrated above. EXAMPLE 14Demonstration thet Anti Astrocytin, Anti Malignin and S TAG are Cytotoxic to Tumor Cells Growing in Tissue Culture. Standard tests for determining cytotoxicity may be used.Generally, the number of cells in a fixed counting chamber, usually arranged to contain about 100 live cells, is counted.These cells are then treated with the agent being tested and the number of cells which are still alive is counted. In a standard test of cytotoxicity of S TAG Solution obtained in accordance with the methods of EXAMPLE 10 against cells in tissue culture derived from a patient with a gliblastoma Grade III IV, well characterized as of glial originS TAG produced death of all cells in the counting chamber even when in high dilution of 1 100 and 1 1000, representing as little as 0.2 and 0.02 ug. of S TAG per ml. of solution.Similar results are obtained with high dilutions of AntiAstrocytin and Anti Malignin. Both the specificity exhibited in EXAMPLE 11 and the cytotoxicity demonstrated in EXAMPLE 12 are highly relevant to the therapeutic possibilities of Anti Astrocytin, AntiMalignin and S TAG for brain tumors in man. While these therapeutic uses are in the future, the practical diagnostic potential of both of these phenomena for tumor tissue removed at operation but requiring diagnosis by histology is already demonstrated herein. EXAMPLE 15Hydrolytic Cleavage of RECOGNINS A solution of RECOGNIN, in this case either Astrocytin or Malignin at pH between 1 and 2 is allowed to stand in the cold. After 7 to 14 days, TLG chromatography shows the product to have been reduced in molecular weight by approximately 200. When the solution is allowed to stand longer, further units of approximately 200 molecular weight are cleaved every 7 to 10 days. Thus with Astrocytin the molecular weight is reduced from 8,000 and with MALIGNIN the molecular weight is reduced from 10,000, in each case by.units of approximately 200 sequeially. The physicochemicalespecificities of Astrocytin are retained by each product down to approximately 4,000 molecular weight. The physicochemical specificities of Malignin are retained by each product down to approximately 5,000 molecular weight. This is shown by Ouchterlony gel diffusion tests against Anti Astrocytin and Anti Malignin, respectively. This cleavage can also be accomplished enzymatically, as with trypsin and other proteinases, with similar results. The molecular weights of these compounds prepared by hydrolytic cleavage of RECOGNINS may be approximately defined by the following formulae For products having the physicochemical specificities of Astrocytin 4000 200 x y For products having the physicochemical specificities of Malignin 5000 200 x y wherein y is the molecular weight of the product and x is an integer from 0 to 19. EXAMPLE 16Production of Artificial Tissue or Organ witch RECOGNINS A rigid walled tube of plastic, metal, or other suitable rigid material is dipped in or impregnated with a highly concentrated, i.e, 10 mg. ml. viscous solution of RECOGNIN, in this case either Astrocytin or Malignin, until all surfaces are fully coated with the RECOGNIN. Alternatively,RECOGNIN solution is passed through and around the tube under pressure until all surfaces are fully coated. The tube is then dried in air or in vacuo, or lyophilized. The process of coating is repeated several times in order to build up multiple molecular layers of RECOGNIN coating. The tube is now ready to be placed in a cavity or in a tissue which contains Astrocytin or Malignin like precursors in the neighboring tissue or fluid of a living mammal. This artificial tissue or organ may be used to minimize or eliminate reaction which foreign substances without RECOGNIN coating would incite Artificial tissues or organs of other geometries may similarly be produced.
