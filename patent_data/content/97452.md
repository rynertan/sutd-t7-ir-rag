## Description
EPOXY ESTER RESIN AND NOVEL TlIEsIOSETTIKG COATING COMPOSITION COMPRISING SA1I This invention relates to a novel epoxy ester resin and to a novel, solvent based, thermosetting coating composition comprising same. It relates also to such coating composition formulated, for example, as sprayable, high solids coating composition suitable for use as an automotive vehicle primer to make coatings which. are highly resistant to corrosion, humidity and solvents. Solvent based coating compositions are known which employ high molecular weight e.g. 2,000 to 40,000 polymer resins having crosslinking functionality, and a suitable crosslinking agent. Typically, such coating compositions are applied to a substrate, for example, by spraying, and are then cured by baking the coated substrate at an elevated temperature suitable to drive off the organic solvent and to promote the crosslinking reaction. The resulting thermoset coating, if sufficiently humidity and solvent resistant, can provide aesthetic and functional advantages including corrosion protection for the underlying substrate. Coating compositions comprising such high molecular weight polymer resins typically comprise only 25 to 50 solids so as to be sprayable or otherwise conveniently applicable to a substrate. The viscosity of coating compositions of higher solids content is typically too high for this purpose. Conventional epoxy ester based automotive vehicle spray primers, for example, typically have a volatile organic content VOC of approximately 623 g l 5.2 lb. gal . Elimination of the volatile organic solvent portion during curing of these conventional low solids coating compositions is relatively large and therefore presents undersirable material handling difficulties, and added expense. Furthermore, excessive solvent losses and or solvent recovery equipment add considerable expense to the coating operation. Recently USA governmental regulations on hydrocarbon emissions, particularly applicable to automotive coating operations, mandate a significant reduction in volatile organic content for coating compositions.Thus, for example, in the UnitedStates, governmental guidelines establish certain deadlines by which time emissions of volatile organics from automotive vehiele imer coating operations itust be reduced to within certain defined limits. To sleet such guidelines, coating compositions of reduced VOC can be employed in conj unction with emissions treatment equipment to achieve the specified emissions limit. Such treatment presents significant additional expense, however, and thus there is a great need for coating compositions of VOC reduced near to, or preferably even lower than the governmental limits, which Kyet can be applied to a substrate using known spray application techniques. In response to these concerns, high solids coating compositions have been suggested which, typically, employ a low molecular weight multi functional adduct or copolymer in combination with a multi functional crosslinking agent. These high solids coating compositions can be applied by spraying, for example, with lower VOC than would be possible with conventional epoxy ester based coating compositions or other conventional coating compositions comprising high molecular weight polymer resins. After application to the substrate, high solids coating compositions are cured by baking at a cure temperature, that is, at an elevated temperature suitable to drive off the volatile organic content and to promote crosslinking and in some instances polymerization of the multi functional low molecular weight component s . Typically, the physical properties of the coatings provided by such known high solids coating compositions can differ significantly from those of the cured coatings provided by the conventional, low solids coating compositions. In particular, the cured coatings obtained from known high solids coating compositions can be inferior in that they can be less flexible, less solvent resistant, less adherent to the substrate and or for other reasons provide less corrosion inhibition for the underlying substrates. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to provide a coating composition comprising low molecular weight materials suitable for use in high solids, solvent based coating compositions and yet which, upon curing, form coatings having physical properties comparable to those obtained from conventional low solids solvent based coating compositions. According to the present invention, novel low molecular weight crosslinkable epoxy ester resins are provided which are adapted for use in thermosetting coating compositions, and which are especially advantageous for use in high solids, organic solvent based thermosetting coating compositions. The epoxy ester resins of the invention are of nuinber average molecular weight Mn about 900 to about 5000, being the reaction product of diepoxide with i a first reactant, in chain extension reaction, selected from diphenol, dicarboxylic acid and a mixture thereof, and ii a second reactant, in chain terminating esterification reaction, comprising fatty acid, which chain extension reaction and esterification reaction occur substantially simultaneocsly at a reaction temperature reaching at least about 1370C, wherein the epoxy functionality, phenol functionality, dicarboxylic acid carboxyl functionality and fatty acid carboxyl functionality are employed in relative proportions of about 1 0 1 0 0.8 0.3 1 equivalents, respectively. Preferably, suitable catalyst is employed to promote more simultaneous chain extension and esterification reactions. According to the coating composition aspect of the invention, a novel, organic solvent based, thermosetting resin composition, in addition to solvent and any pigments and additives such as, for example, catalysts, flow control agents and the like, comprises the epoxy ester resin of the invention. In particular, a novel organic solvent based thermosetting coating composition comprises A. epoxy ester resin of number average molecular weight Mn about 900 to about 5000, being the reaction product of diepoxide with i a first reactant, in chain extension reaction, selected from diphenol, dicarboxylic acid and a mixture thereof, and ii a second reactant, in chain terminating esterification reaction, comprising fatty acid, which chain extension reaction and esterification reaction occur substantially simultaneously at a reaction temperature reaching at least about 137 C, wherein the epoxy functionality, phenol functionality, dicarboxylic acid carboxyl functionality and fatty acid carboxyl functionality are employed in relative proporations of about 1 0 1 0 0.8 0.3 1 equivalents, respectively B. polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agent and C. optionally, polycarboxy functional polymeric catalyst of number average molecular weight Mn about 1,000 10,000 being substantially unreactive at room temperature with the epoxy ester resin and the polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agent, in an amount of about 2 to about 15 by weight of resin solids in the coating composition. Particularly preferred compositions of the invention are those formulated as high solids coating compositions adapted to be applied by spraying onto a substrate. Such compositions are especially useful as a primer coat on the bare, unpolished metal surface of an automotive vehicle body. As used herein, a high solids coating composition is one in which a volatile organic content of about 4Q7 g l 3.4 lb. gal. or less yields a viscosity ofless than approximately 35 sec., 4 Ford Cup at 270C 80OF . According to another aspect of the invention, a method of making a corrosion, solvent and humidity resistant coating on a substrate comprises applying to the substrate the novel, solvent based, thermosetting coating composition of the invention and subsequently subjecting the coating to an elevated temperature for a time period sufficient to substantially cure the coating layer. Typically, the novel coating compositions of the invention can be cured by heating to between about 1000C 2120F and about 2300C 4450F , for a time period sufficient to yield a cured coating, for example for about 15 to about 60 minutes. According to preferred embodiments of the invention, the coating composition can be sufficiently cured for good coating properties by heating to about 120 OC 250 OF for about 15 minutes but, in addition, such preferred composition will tolerate curing at up to about 2000C 3920F for as much as about 60 minutes without substantial lose of such advantageous coating properties. The coating compositions of the present invention have been found especially advantageous for use as high solids primer compositions suitable to be applied by spraying tedhniques. More specifically, high solids coating compositions according to the invention, formulated, for example, at VOC as low as about 347 g l 2.9 lb. gal. to about 503 g l 4.2 lb. gal. are found to have visc9sity as low as about 15 to about 45 sec., num 4 Ford Cup at 27 C and are well suited to spray application techniques.High solids coating composition according to preferred embiodiments are found to have viscosity as low as about 15 sec. to about 25 sec., num 4 Ford Cup at 27 C, atVOC of about 407 g l to about 443 g l 3.4 to 3.7 lb. gal. . Accordingly, the coating compositions of the invention provide ease of material handling and less e xpensathan than previously known coating compositions which were sprayable only at higher VOC. Furthermore, the coating compositions of the invention can be used to meet or exceed governmental guidelines regarding hydrocarbon emissions with a reduction or elimination of emissions treatment and emissions treatment equipment. In addition, reduction in the amount of hydrocarbon solvent used in the coating composition provides direct cost advantage. Unlike various previously suggested high solids coating compositions, the coating compositions of the present invention provide the above mentioned low VOC and cure responseJadvantages without sacrifice of advantageous physical pro perties in the cured coating. On the contrary, when applied, for example, over a metallic substrate, such as when applied as an automotive vehicle primer coat over bare sheet steel, cured coatings according tot the invention have been found to provide excellent adhesion to the substrate, excellent humidity resistance, and excellent corrosion resistance in comparison td other commercially available high solids coating compositions of similar nature. Other features and advantages of this invention will become more apparent from the succeeding, detailed description thereof including the preferred embodiments and best mode of carrying out this invention. Detailed Description of the Invention It is a significant characertizing aspect of the invention that the chain extension reactions of the diepoxide with dicarboxylic acid, diphenol or a mixture of both and the chain termination esterification reaction of the diepoxide with fatty acid are carried out substantially simultaneously.While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently understood that the ester ificat ion reaction of the carboxyl functionality of the fatty acid with the epoxy functionality of the diepoxide proceeds at approximately the same or similar rate as the chain extension reaction of the phenolic hydroxy functionality of the diphenol with the epoxy functionality and at very nearly the same or similar rate as the chain extension reaction of the carboxyl functionality of the dicarboxylic acid with the epoxy functionality, given the reaction conditions of the invention as specified herein.Likewise, reaction of the hydroxy functionality generated by the aforesaid chain extension and chain termination reactions with the carboxyl functionality of the fatty acid proceeds at very nearly the same or similar rate as the reaction of such hydroxyl functionality with the carboxyl functionality of dicarboxylic acid. Carrying out these reactions simultaneously produces a resin comprising a mixture of reaction products of diverse molecular structures, not merely a series of analogs of the same structure. That is, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently understood that in the course of the simultaneous chain extension and chain termination reactions, the diepoxide and the epoxide functional chain extended intermediate reaction products react with the dicarboxylic acid, diphenol and fatty acid in random sequence. Thus, each chain extended reaction product in the epoxy ester resin of the invention, having followed a certain reaction sequence, would differ structurally from the reaction products of different reaction sequence.In addition to reaction products of diverse molecular structures, reaction of the diepoxide and of the epoxy functional chain extended intermediate reaction produ s simultaneously with the dicarboxylic acid and with the diphenol and with chain terminating fatty acid is seen to yield a product epoxy ester resin of exceptionally wide molecular weight distribution such as, for example, from about 600 or less to about 12,000 or more. A significant advantage of the invention which is presently understood to stem, in part, from the simultaneous reaction, and particularly from such diversity of molecular structure and wide molecular weight distribution of the epoxy ester resin reaction product, is the surprisingly low viscosity of the coating compositions comprising these resins. More specifically, the coating compositions of the invention are found to have a significantly lower viscosity at a given solids content by weight than many comparable, commercially available high solids coating compositions. Accordingly, the coating composition of the invention can be sprayed or otherwise applied to a substrate at significantly higher solids content and, thus, require significantly lower VOC.Such reduced viscosity and increased solids content provides a highly significant advance in the art for all of the reasons discussed above, including reduced cost of material handling, reduced emissions of volatile organics, reduced cost of compliance with government guidelines, and other related advantages. It is seen to be another consequence of the exceptionally wide molecular weight distribution and diversity of molecular structures that the glass transition temperature Tg of the novel epoxy ester resin of the invention is advantageously low. More accurately, it is presently understood that the lower molecular weight fraction of the epoxy ester resin and any unreacted monomer act in the nature of a plasticizer for the resin to effectively provide a lower apparent Tg. In any event, it is significant that the low Tg is achieved, even in those epoxy ester resins of the invention comprising high aromatic content. A low Tg is well known to provide an improved, smoother surface on the cured coating. During heating to cure the coating, after it reaches its Tg and before it substantially cures at its cure temperature, the coating can flow and become smooth.Thus, the lower Tg provides a longer time period during which the coating can flow and become smooth and thus improve the surface quality of the. cured z .cur ed coating. In addition, the wider molecular weight distribution of the epoxy ester resin components is believed to contribute, in part, to the advantageous flexibility of the cured coating of the invention. This coating flexibility is unexpected in view of the high weight percent of aromatic units in the epoxy ester resin. Such high flexibility in conjunction with high aromatic content is especially advantageous in view of the very significant cost advantage of aromatic over aliphatic feedstocks. Further, it is now believed that aromatics in a coating composition, such as a primer composition for a metal substrate, are more resistant to hydrolysis than are aliphatics. Accordingly, while again not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently believed that the high aromatic content of the epoxy ester resin of the invention explains in part the exceptional corrosion protection found to be provided by the novel coatings of the present invention. This is especially the case, for example, according to preferred embodiments of the invention, further discussed below, wherein diphenol is employed and the diepoxide reactant as well as the diphenol provides aromatic units to the resin.In addition, it is presently understood that phenolic oxygens introduced into the epoxy ester resin by the chain extension reaction of phenol with epoxy, advantageously provide excellent adhesion to metal substrate, for example steel substrate. Thus, the high aromatic content of the cured coating and its excellent adhesion each enhances the advantage provided by the other to yield the above mentioned exceptional corrosion protection of the cured coatings cf the invention. According to a most preferred embodiment of the invention, further discussed below, acyclic aliphatic dicarboxylic acid is employed in the synthesis of the epoxy ester resin. According to this embodiment, the epoxy ester resin reaction product comprises both aromatic and aliphatic moieties in random sequence and distribution. While, again, not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently understood that the aromatic units of the diphenol and the aliphatic units of the dicarboxylic units each enhances the advantages of the other in an unexpected and synergistic manner. More specifically, the aliphatic units are seen to provide flexibility to the epoxy ester resin while the aromatic units, as mentioned above, provide moisture and corrosion resistance.Thus, the epoxy ester resin reaction product provide a cured coating having both good flexibility and good moisture and corrosion resistance. The diepoxide reactant suitable for the epoxy ester resin can be any of numerous diepoxides including many which are commercially available and which will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. While, ultimately, the choice of reactants for preparing the epoxy ester resin will depend to an extent upon the particular application intended for the coating composition, terminal diepoxides, that is diepoxides bearing two terminal epoxide groups, are generally most preferred. These are generally more reactive and therefore require reaction conditions under which undesirable side reactions, for example1 epoxy epoxy reactions and gellation, can be more easily avoided.Preferably, the diepoxide has a number average molecular weight thin between about 100 and about 1000, and more preferably between about 100 and about 600. Numerous such preferred diepoxides are readily commercially available, for example, bisphenol A epichlorohydrin epoxy resin, for example, the Epon trademark series, Shell ChemicalCompany, Boston, Texas, and the DER trademark series,Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan.Also preferred are cycloaliphatic diepoxy resins, for example, the Eponex trademark series, Shell Chemical Company, Houston,Texas, hydantoin epoxy resins such as, for example, ResinXB2793 trademark , Ciba Geigy Corporation, Ardsley, NewYork, and any of a wide variety of acyclic or cyclic aliphatic diepoxides such as, for example, l,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether and 4 vinylcyclohexene dioxide and the like. Among those listed, diglycidyl ether bisphenol A resins or higher molecular wieght analogs thereof, are most preferred in view of their cost and commercial availability, for example, Epon 828 trademark and Epon 829 trademark , of the Epon trademark series mentioned above. The higher molecular weight members of the Epon trademark series are suitable for use where higher molecular weight epoxy ester resins are desired.Generally, however, such higher molecular weight resins provide coating compositions of somewhat higher viscosity or lower solids content . Additionaly, it should be recognized that the higher molecular weight members of the Epon series, for example Epon 1001 and Epon 1004, may be somewhat less preferred, since these bear hydroxyl functionality which may undergo undesirable side reactions with, for example, epoxy functionality. The result can be undesirable resin properties and gellation. Other suitable diepoxides for use in synthesizing the epoxy ester resin of the invention are commercially available and will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Also, it will be under stood from the foregoing that any mixture of compatible diepoxides may be used. In addition to the diepoxide, a portion of the epoxy functionality can be provided by any compatible monoepoxy compund .mcre suitably, polyepoxy compound or mixture of compounds having three or more epoxy groups per molecule. Suitable such polyepoxides include, for example, those of molecular weight about 200 to about 800.The polyepoxide can be essentially any of the well known types such as polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols. These can be produced by etherification of a polyphenol with epihalohydrin in the presence of alkali. It will be recognized by the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure, that in some instances, particularly where a coating compositoin of high solids content is less important, it may be desirable to employ polyepoxides having higher molecular weights. Preferably, any such polyepoxide contains free hydroxyl groups in addition to epoxide groups. While polyglycidyl ethers of polyphenols can be employed, it is frequently desirable in such compositions to react a portion of the reactive sites hydroxyl or in some instances epoxy with a modifying material to vary the film characteristics of the resin. The epoxy resin may be modified, for example, with isocyanate group containing organic materials or other reactive organic materials. Another quite useful class of poiyepoxides are the Novolak resins including, for example, the Novalak epoxy resins ECN 1235 trademark and ECN 1273 trademark , Ciba Geigy Corporation. According to preferred embodiments of the present invention, epoxide compounds other than diepoxide compounds provide no more than about 15 and most preferably substantially none of the total epoxide functionality in the reactants used to form the epoxy ester resin. The diphenol reactant suitable for the epoxy ester resin of the present invention includes numerous commerically available materials, many of which will be readily apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Preferred diphenols have the general formula I EMI15.1 wherein R is a divalent linking moiety substantially unreactive with the diepoxide resin. Preferably R is a divalent, organic, linking moiety, for example, CH2 n where n is preferably from about 1 to about 8, C C, and the like, although inorganic moieties, for example Rulfonyl and the like, are also suitable.Diphenols of this character have been found to provide good reactivity with the preferred diepoxides described above and to provide, ultimately, cured coatings of the invention having excellent physical properties, most notably excellent corrosion protection. It will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure that R should be substantially unreactive with the fatty acid employed for the epoxy ester resin.Particularly preferred diphenols include those according to formula I above, wherein R is selected from the group comprising a straight or branched alkylene or alkylidene moiety of one to about 10 carbons, preferably having three to four carbons and most preferably having the general formulaEMI16.1 wherein R and RZ are the same or different and each is a monovalent organic moiety preferrably selected from the group comprising hydrogen and lower alkyl, of about one to four carbons, most preferably one or two carbons, and the like or a mixture of any of them. Preferably the diphenol has a number average molecular weight Mn between about 180 and about 500, more preferably between about 180 and about 250.Diphenols within this range, employed with the preferred diepoxides described above, and suitable fatty acid are found to provide epoxy ester resins comprising mixed reaction products of particularly wide molecular weight distribution, which resins as discussed above are found to provide coating compositions of the invention having especially advantageous physical properties including low Tg and good corrosion protection. Such diphenois include, for example bisphenol A, which is most preferred, bisphenol B and the like and a compatible mixture of any of them. As used herein the term diphenol may include, for example, compounds comprising a single dihydroxy substituted phenyl ring such as benzenediol.More preferred, however, are those diphenols providing two terminal, mono hydroxy substituted phenyl rings such as in formula I , above. Other examples of diphenols are bis 4 hydroxy tert butylphenyl 2,2 propane, bis 2hydroxy naphthyl methane and 1, 5 dihydroxynaphthalene. Other suitable diphenols for the epoxy ester resin of the present invention will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. The dicarboxylic acid reactant suitable for the epoxy ester resin of the present invention includes numerous commercially available materials, many of which will be readily apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Suitable dicarboxylic acids include saturated or unsaturated, cyclic or acyclic aliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids or a mixture thereof. Acyclic aliphatic dicarboxylic acids are generally preferred in view of the enhanced flexibility they provide to the cured coatings of the invention.Preferred dicarboxylic acids have the general formula I HOOC R COOH I wherein R is a divalent linking moiety substantially unreactive with the diepoxide resin. It will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure, that R should be substantially unreactive also with the fatty acid employed for the epoxy ester resin, with hydroxy functionality generated in the chain extension reaction and, at least at storage temperatures1 with the crosslinking agent employed in the coating composition. Preferably R is a divalent, organic linking moiety.Particularly preferred are those dicarboxylic acids wherein R is selected from the group comprising a straight or branched alkylene or alkylidene moiety, preferably of about 4 42 carbons, for example, CH2 n wherein n is preferably from about 4 to about 42, and the like or a mixture thereof. Dicarboxylic acids of this character have been found to provide good reactivity with the preferred diepoxides described above and to provide, ultimately, cured coatings of the invention having excellent physical properties, most notably excellent flexibility and corrosion protection.Preferably the dicarboxylic acid has a number average molecular weight Mn between about 145 and about 1000, more preferably about 570. Dicarboxylic acids within this range, employed with the preferred diepoxide and preferred diphenol, described above, and preferred fatty acid, described below, are found to provide epoxy ester resins comprising mixed reaction products of particularly wide molecular weight distribution, which resins as discussed above are found to provide coating compositions of the invention having especially advantageous physical properties including low Tg and good humidity and corrosion protection. Exemplary dicarboxylic acids include adipic acid, 3,3 dimethylpentanedioic acid, benzenedicarboxylic acid, phenylenediethanoic acid, naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them.While dicarboxylic acids according to formula I can be used, wherein R is an alkylene chain of less than 4 carbons, for example, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid and the like, these are less preferred in view of the somewhat lesser degree of flexibility provided thereby. Preferably the dicarboxylic acid provides two terminal carboxyl groups. Similarly, preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acids are those wherein the carboxylic groups are more spaced apart, for example, r,8 benzene dicarboxylic acid and 2,7 naphthalenedicarboxylic acid. The most preferred dicarboxylic acids are substantially saturated, acyclic, aliphatic dimer acids, which are well known to the skilled of the art and readily commercially available. These are typically the dimerization reaction products of fatty acids which have from 4 to 22 carbons and a terminal carboxyl group. Of these, dimer acid of 36 carbons is most preferred since it provides excellent reactivity with the preferred diepoxides described above, provides epoxy ester reaction products of advantageously wide molecular weight distribution, and provides, ultimately, cured coatings of the invention having excellent physical properties.In addition, dimer acid of 36 carbons is readily commercially available, for example, as Empol 1014 trademark , Empol 1016 trademark and Empol 1018 trademark , each available from Emery Industries, Inc., Cinclnnatl, Ohio.It should be recognized that most or all commercially available dimer acids contain some portion of trimer acid, typically, for example, about 5 10 , but in some cases as much as 30 or more, and also contain a usually smaller portion of monocarboxylic acid. As used herein, the term dimer acid includes those containing such amounts of these materials. Most useful in the present compositions are products that contain mostly dibasic acid and non. or low amounts of tribasic and monobasic acids. Aliphatic dicarboxylic acids are seen to provide additional advantages. In particular, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently understood that epoxy ester resins derived therefrom wet the substrate surface better and, thus, provide enhanced adhesion between the substrate and the cured coating. They also flow better and provide an excellent, smooth surface upon being cured. Also, the aliphatic units provide enhanced flexibility to the cured coating, as noted above, and this flexibility of the coating is seen to provide enhanced impact resistance. In this regard, it is presently understood that in the epoxy ester resins according to preferred embodiments, employing aliphatic dicarboxylic acid and aliphatic fatty acid, the molecular weight distribution is exceptionally wide due to the approximately identical reaction rates of these reactants with the diepoxide.Such exceptionally wide molecular weight distribution further enhances the flexibility of the cured coating. where corrosion protection for the substrate is important, it may be preferred to employ dicarboxylic acid according to formula I above, wherein R is, at least in part, aromatic. As noted above, it is believed that aromatic in a coating composition of the invention, such as a primer composition for a metal substrate, are more resistant to hydrolysis than are aliphatics and, therefore, provide enhanced corrosion and moisture resistance. Of course, the diphenol and, according to preferred embodiments described above, the diepoxide reactant each provides aromatic units to the resin and each would similarly contribute to corrosion and moisture resistance. Other suitable dicarboxylic acids for the epoxy ester resin of the present invention will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. The fatty acid employed as a chain terminating esterification reactant for the epoxy ester resin of the present invention includes numerous commercially available materials. Suitable fatty acids include those derived from or contained in either animal or vegetable fat or oil. Preferred are fatty acids of from about 8 to about 18 carbons. Also preferred among the fatty acids are the more saturated fatty acids, since it appears that olefinic unsaturation in the fatty acid can undergo a polymerization type reaction between such double bonds during the synthesis of the epoxy ester resin of the invention.Unsaturated fatty acids are suitable for use, however, such as, for example, oleic acid, linoleic, linolenic or the like and mixtures of those acids, and can be used together with a suitable inhibitor for the polymerization type reaction such as hydroquinone or the like, of which many are commercially available and will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. In addition, aromatic fatty acids are commercially available and can be employed. The aliphatic fatty acids are preferred, however, in view of the enhanced coating flexibility they provide. Especially preferred for use are the substantially saturated fatty acids such as Soya fatty acid which is most preferred, and butyric, lauric, palmitic and stearic fatty acids and the like or a mixture of any of them.These are relatively inexpensive and have been found to provide good reactivity with the preferred diepoxides described above. For convenience of use, the fatty acids which are semisolid or liquid at room temperature are generally preferred over the solid fatty acids. The epoxy ester resin of the invention can be made according to reaction conditions how specified, employing techniques which are well known and which will be readily apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. The chain extension and chain termination reactions occur substantially simultaneously by charging the diepoxide, the diphenol and or dicarboxylic acid and the fatty acid in a suitable reactor and heating the mixture. It should be recognized that to assure rapid and or more complete reaction of the diepoxide with carboxyl and phenol functionalities, and to assure that these reactions occur substantially concurrently at approximately the same or similar rates, it is usually preferred to have a catalyst present.Alternatively, other techniques, for example, higher reaction temperatures and or longer reaction times, or relatively greater proportion of diphenol since, absent catalyst, phenol functionality is believed to be somewhat less reactive with diepoxide than is carboxyl functionality , can be used to provide substantially simultaneous reactions. The use of catalyst, however, has been found to provide advantageous epoxy ester resin of the invention and is preferred. Epon 829 trademark , mentioned above, as commercially available, provides a proprietary catalyst. Epon 828 trademark , is substantially the same but does not provide such catalyst.Suitable catalysts are commercially available and include, any of the well known catalysts for epoxy carboxylic epoxyphenol reactions such as, for example, sodium carbonate which is preferred, and lithium neodecanoate, lithium naphthenate, lithium nanoate, other known organmetallic catalysts and tertiary amine catalysts and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them. Others will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Where both diphenol and dicarboxylic acid are employed, the reaction mixture is generally heated to at least about 1270C 2800F , preferably at least about 1760C 3500F . In some instances, in the presence of catalyst, exothermic reaction will proceed with or without further heating and the reaction mixture will then reach about 1930 3800C 380v 450µF , depending, in part, upon the batch size and reactor vessel insulation, etc. In the absence of catalyst, such exotherm typically is not observed and continued heating is required to maintain the reaction temperature preferably at about 1760C 193 OC 3500F 380 F . The progress of the reaction can be followed by measuring acid number. After the acid number measurements have indicated the reaction is sufficiently completed, preferably at acid number 6 or less, the resin may be diluted with suitable solvent in order to reduce the viscosity to a desirable level. A non volatile level of 80 has been found to be suitable for storage of the coating composition. Where diphenol is employed and no dicarboxylic acid is employed the reaction mixture is heated to at least about 1750C 3450F , when, in the presence of catalyst, exothermic reaction normally will proceed with or without further heating. Typically, the reaction mixture will then reach about 1950 2050C 3800 4000F , depending, in part, upon the bath size and reactor vessel insulation, etc. In the absence of catalyst, such exotherm typically is not observed and continued heating is required.After the acid number measurements have indicated the reaction is. sufficiently completed, preferably at acid number 6 or less, the resin may be diluted with suitable solvent in order to reduce the viscosity to a desirable level. Where dicarboxylic acid is employed and no diphenol is employed, the reaction is generally heated, in the presence of catalyst, to at least about 1350C 280oF , preferably. at least about 1500C 3000F . While not a serious concern if the dicarboxylic acid consists of the preferred dimer acids discussed above, in the case of certain dicarboxylic acids greatly differring from the fatty acid employed in the reaction, reaction temperatures below about 1350C 2800F may result in the rate of reaction of the fatty acid with the diepoxide being significantly different from the rate of reaction of the dicaboxylic acid with the diepoxide. Typically, the reaction mixture is heated to about 1700 1900C 3400 3700F , and maintained at that temperature.An exothermic reaction is observed and the progress of the reaction can be followed by measuring acid number. After the acid number measurements have indicated the reaction is sufficiently completed, preferably at acid number 7 or less, the resin may be diluted with suitable solvent in order to reduce the viscosity to a desirable level for use or storage. Since, in the preferred embodiments described above, the chain extension reaction of the epoxide functionality with the phenol functionality and or with the carboxyl functionality of the dicarboxylic acid proceeds at approximately the same rate as the chain termination reaction of the epoxide functionality with the carboxylic functionality of the fatty acid, and since these reactions are carried out substantially simultaneously to yield the epoxy ester resin of the invention, it should be recognized that the relative proportions of the reactants in the reaction mixture can significantly affect the properties of the product resin.Accordingly, when both diphenol and dicarboxylic acid are employed in chain extension reaction with the diepoxide, the epoxy functionality, phenol functionality, dicarboxylic acid carboxyl functionality and fatty acid carboxyl functionality are preferably employed in relative proportions of about 1 0.2 0.6 0,1 0.4 0.4 0.9.More preferably the reactants are present in amounts which provide one equivalent of epoxy functionality to about 0.4 0.6 equivalent of phenol functionality, about 0.1 0.3 equivalent of dicarboxylic acid carboxyl functionality, and about 0.6 0.8 equivalent of fatty acid carboxyl functionality. Most preferably, diepoxide, diphenol, dicarboxylic acid and fatty acid are present in relative amounts to provide approximately 1 0.5 0.25 0.8 equivalents of functionality, respectively.One most preferred embodiment of the novel epoxy ester resin of the invention comprises the reaction product of digycidyl ether bisphenol A resin with bisphenol A, the dimerization reaction product of C 18 fatty acid and Soya fatty acid, where in the components are employed in relative proportions of about 1 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.5 0.9 1.2 by weight, respectively. In using diphenol without dicarboxylic acid, the epoxy functionality, phenol functionality and carboxyl functionality are employed preferably in relative proporations of about 1 0.4 1 0.4 1. More preferably, the relative proportions in that case are one equivalent of epoxy functionality to about 0.5 0.7 equivalent of phenol functionality to about 0.5 0.7 equivalent of carboxyl functionality. Most preferably, diepoxide, diphenol and fatty acid are present in relative amounts to provide approximately 1 0.7 0.6 equivalents of functionality, respectively. In using dicarboxylic acid without diphenol, the epoxy functionality, dicarboxylic acid carboxyl functionality and fatty acid carboxyl functionality are employed preferably in relative proportion of about 1 0.3 8 0.3 0.8. More preferably, the relative proportions in that case are one equivalent of epoxy functionality to about 0.4 0.6 equivalent of dicarboxylic acid carboxyl functionality, to about 0.4 0.6 equivalent of fatty acid carboxyl functionality. Most preferably, diepoxide, dicarboxylic acid and fatty acid are employed in relative amounts of approximately 1 0.4 t 0.5 equivalents of functionality, respectively.One most preferred embodiment employs the reaction product of digylcidyl ether bisphenol A resin with a the dimerization reaction product of C 18 fatty acid and b Soya fatty acid, in relative proportions of about 1 0.5 0.7 0.7 0.9 by weight, respectively. Epoxy ester resins provided according to these preferred ranges of reactant amounts have been found to provide coating compositions having preferred physical properties, most especially corrosion protection such as, for example, when spray applied to metal substrate such as, for example, bare, unpolished automotive vehicle body sheet steel. In the absence of catalyst for the epoxy phenol and epoxy carboxy reactions, it is generally preferred to use a relatively greater portion of diphenol within the ranges specified above. Some unreacted diphenol can be tolerated in the reaction product. Where diphenol reactant is used, either in addition to dicarboxylic acid or exclusive thereof, the exceptional humidity resistance, corrosion inhibition and other physical properties provided by the coating compositions of the invention are presently believed to stem in large part from a novel chemistry not previously known or suggested. More specifically, while not wishing to be bound by theory, it appears that the epoxy ester resins of the invention may comprise, in substantial part, phenol terminated constituents. That is, whereas previously known epoxy adducts suggested for use in coating compositions are reported to be terminated by esterification epoxy groups, it now appears that the epoxy ester resins of the present invention are, in substantial part, phenol terminated.This phenomenon is presently understood to be a consequence of the reaction of the diepoxide reactant with the diphenol functional reactant and, simultaneously, with the carboxyl functional reactant s , i.e., dicarboxylic acid, if any, and fatty acid in the relative proportions of reactants specified above. The carboxyl functionality competes with the phenol functionality for reaction with the epoxy functionality. This phenomenon is illustrated in Example Cx. Consequently, notwithstanding the excess of epoxy relative to phenol in the preferred embodiments described above reaction products bearing terminal phenol are present upon exhaustion of unreacted epoxy functionality. It would have been expected that the carboxyl functionality would react in major part with the pendent hydroxy groups of the chain extended intermediate reaction products. However, such reaction would, of course, produce a water molecule and upon distillation of the epoxy ester resin reaction product, little more water is found than would be contributed as impurity in the reactants.Accordingly, while a small portion of the dicarboxylic acid if any and fatty acid may react with such pendent hydroxy groups, it seems clear that a far larger portion than would have been expected reacts with epoxy in competition with the phenol functionality such that the reaction product, i.e. the epoxy ester resin of the invention, is, in substantial part, phenol terminated,One most significant advantage believed to stem, in part, from this novel chemistry is the excellent cure response of the coating compositions of the invention. The terminal phenol moiety is believed to provide exceptionally high reactivity with polyfunctional aininoplast crosslinking agent at elevated cure temperatures The above described epoxy ester resin is employed together with polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agent.Included within the crosslinking agents suitable for use in the compositions of the invention are numerous materials which are well known to the skilled of the art including, for example, alkylated melamine formaldehyde resins with one to about eight carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Other suitable crosslinking agents will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Many such crosslinking agents are readily commercially available including, for example, theResimene trademark series, Monsanto Company, St. Louis,Missouri, the most preferred being Resimene 717 trademark , described as a low temperature curt methylated melamine formaldehyde resin. In addtion, suitable polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agents can be prepared employing conventional techniques. Accordingly, for example, a lower alkanol such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, isobutanol, isopropanol, hexanol, 2 ethylhexanol or the like or a mixture of any of them is reacted with a melamine formaldehyde. Preferred crosslinking agents of this type include butylated melamine formaldehyde resin, methylated butylated formaldehyde resin and polyalkyl ethers of polymethylol melamines and the like, of which hexamethoxymethyl melamine resin is most preferred in view of its relatively lower cost, ready commercial availability, its low reactivity with the epoxy ester resin of the invention at normal storage temperatures and its high reactivity at elevated cure temperatures.In this regard, preferred polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agent is substantially unreactive with the epoxy ester resin at or below about 600C. Other suitable melamine crosslinking agents will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. The proper proportion of polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agent to epoxy ester resin will depend, in part, upon the properties desired in the coating to be produced and, in part, upon the desired cure response of the coating composition which will depend, in turn, upon the baking schedule intended for curing the coating composition and, in part, upon the desired storage stability of the coating composition, that is, upon the desired shelf life. Accordingly, the amounts of epoxy ester resin that can be blended with the crosslinker to form coating compositions of the invention may be varied considerably. Preferably, the crosslinking agent is used in amounts of about 5 to about 40 by weight of the total resin solids, more preferably about 20 to about 309. The coating compositions of the invention have been found to provide a cured coating having the advantageous physical properties described above, over a wide range of cure temperatures. More specifically, the coating compositions according to preferred embodiments of the invention have been found to cure at temperatures from as low as about 1200C or less within about 15 minutes or less, and yet to cure and suffer no significant loss of advantageous physical properties at temperatures as high as about 2000C or more for periods up to about 60 minutes or more. Considered together with the storage stability of the coating composition, it can be readily recognized that the present invention provides a highly significant advance in the coating composition art. The present invention includes the use of polycarboxy functional polymeric catalyst as an optional component of the coating composition of the invention.Use of the polycarboxy functional polymeric catalyst is a further novel and significantly advantageous aspect of the presnent invent ion. Such catalyst can be made according to conventional polymerization processes well known to the skilled of the art, such as batch polymerization. Accordingly, the polymeric catalyst can be made, for example, by conventional techniques in which the monomers, solvents and polymerization initiators are charged into a reaction vessel and heated to a polymerization temperature for sufficient time to form the copolymer. Preferably, the monomers and a polymerization initiator, for example t butyl perbenzoate, are first mixed together, optionally with a small quantity of solvent, and then added slowly, for example over several hours, to refluxing solvent containing additional polymerization initiator. The polymerization initiator in the refluxing solvent can be one different from but compatible with the initiator mixed with the monomers, for example, cumene hydroperoxide.Other suitable polymerization initiators are well known and will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Preferably the polymeric catalyst is stored in lined drums, since it has been found to be somewhat incompatible with steel. The polymeric catalyst may comprise any suitable polycarboxy functional material which is compatible with the other components of the coating composition. In general, the polymeric catalyst can be any polycarboxy functional compound or mixture of compounds substantially unreactive with the epoxy ester resin and the polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agent, at storage conditions, that is, typically, at room temperature . Preferably, the polymeric catalyst has a number average molecular weight tHn about 1,000 10,000, more preferably about 1,500 to about 3, 000. While use of polymeric catalyst of higher number average molecular weight, for example, about 10,000, is found to produce coating compositions of somewhat higher viscosity, when used in suitable amounts, for example about 2 5 by weight of epoxy ester resin, it is possible to employ same to prepare high solids coating compositions.According to preferred embodiments, the polymeric catalyst comprises the polymerization reaction product of i suitable ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid providing a double bond for polymerization such as, for example, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, which two are preferred, butanoic acid and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them, with ii any suitable ethylenically unsaturated copolymerization monomer providing a double bond for polymerization reaction product no functionality substantially reactive with the epoxy ester resin or the polyfunctional crosslinking agent of the coating composition at storage temperature. According to such preferred embodiments, the polycarboxy functionality is introduced into the polymer as pendent groups on the polymer backbone by copolymerizing the carboxylic acid with the copolymerization monomer. Suitable copolymerization monomrs include, for example, alkyl acrylates and alkyl methacrylates having 1 to about 8 carbons, preferably about 1 4 carbons, in the alkyl group. Typical alkyl acrylates that can be used to prepare the polymeric catalyst are methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate including, for example, isopropyl acrylate, any butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, 2 methylpentyl acrylate, octyl acrylate and the like or a mixture of any of them. Generally preferred are butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate or a mixture of them.Preferred copolymerization monomers include butyl methacrylate, which is generally most preferred, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, styrene, any suitable vinyl ethers, and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them. Suitable carboxylic acids and copolymerization monomres in addition to those recited above are commercially available and will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. According to certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the polymeric catalyst is the reaction product of about 55 to about 80 by weight, preferably about 70 by weight copolymerization monomers with about 20 to about 45 , preferably about 30 by weight carboxylic acid monomers. One preferred polymeric catalyst according to the invention consists of the polymerization product of about 30 by weight acrylic acid with about 708 by weight butyl methacrylate. The polymerization reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of initiator such as t butyl perbenzoate and cumene hydroperoxide or the like. A suitable procedure for making this and other polymeric catalyst of the invention is detailed in the Examples, below. The amount of polymeric catalyst used in the coating composition of the invention depends, in part, upon the desired cure response and, in part, upon the physical properties desired in the cured coating.Preferably, sufficient polymeric catalyst is used to provide significant improvement in the physical properties of the cured coating while maintaining the coating composition sufficiently storage stable for its intended use. It should be noted, however, as further discussed below, that it is a significant advantage of the present invention that the coating compositions are far more storage stable with the polymeric catalyst than are like compositions containing an equivalent amount of known, non polymeric catalyst. It should be noted, in addition, that the coating compositions of the invention can employ a portion, preferably a minor portion, if any, of the known, non polymeric catalysts in conjunction with the above described polymeric catalyst.Such non polymeric catalysts known to the skilled of the art to catalyse the aminoplast crosslinking reaction include, for example, p toluenesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, phenyl acid phosphate, butyl phosphate, butyl maleate, and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them. These catalysts are known to be most useful for coating compositions intended for low temperature curing schedules and or when highly etherified melamine resins are used such as hexa methoxymethyl melamine or the like and are used in amounts which depend, in part, upon the intended baking curing schedule. Typically, amounts of about 0. 2 to about 3.X by weight of total resin solids are used. In the present invention, it is most preferred that the polycarboxy functional acrylic copolymer catayst be used without such additional, non polymeric catalyst. While it will be within the skill of the art in view of the present disclosure to determine the most suitable amount of polymeric catalyst to be used in a coating composition of the invention intended for a given use, it typically will be preferred to use sufficient polymeric catalyst to raise the acid level of the epoxy ester resin as high as about 50, more preferably about 15 to about 35. Generally preferred is use of polymeric catalyst in amounts of about 2 108 by weight of resin solids in the coating composition. In the preferred embodiment of the coating composition of the present invention, about 5 10 polymeric catalyst has been found to be more preferred, and about 8 most preferred.Although up to 15 or more can be usefully employed, such amounts may not provide the full advantage of storage stability provided by use of more preferred amounts. The polymeric catalyst can be added to the epoxy ester resin by any known mixing method. Preferably, however, it is 1hot blended , that is, it is mixed with the epoxy ester resin at elevated temperature, for example at or above about 1050C 2200F . Mixing at room temperature produces a somewhat cloudy coating composition, while, surprisingly, mixing at elevated temperature is found to produce a clear coating composition. The hot blended clear coating composition has unexpectedly been found to provide a cured coating of higher gloss than the cold blended cloudy composition.Of course, where higher gloss is not desirable, it may be preferred to cold blend the resin and catalyst to avoid the added time and expense of heating same. As noted above, the optional polymeric catalyst component of the present invention is a significantly advantageous aspect of the present invention. More specifically, it has been found to increase the storage stability of the epoxy ester resin coating compositions over that of like resin coating compositions employing known non polymeric catalyst. Thus, for example, coating compositions according to preferred embodiments of the invention can be subjected to about 60 C for periods of about 24 hours with only small increase in viscosity, for example, an increase or less than about 5 sec., 4 FordCup at 270C.And even when subjected to temperatures of about 600C for periods of about 120 hours, preferred embodiments of the coating composition are found to increase in viscosity less than about 10 sec., 4 Ford Cup at 27cm. etc Surprisingly, in addition to improved storage stability, the coating czxposition of the invention comprising polycarboxy functional polymeric catalyst can be cured at advantageously low temperatures. Thus, coating compositions of the invention can be cured within about 15 30 minutes at temperatures as low as about 1350C 65 at and yet yield substantially optimal properties. In fact, even when the coating composition of the present invention is cured at such lower temperatures, the physical properties of the coating are improved over those achieved at higher cure temperatures by some previously known high solids coating compositions employing known, non polymeric catalysts. Specifically, for example, the present invention, especially according to preferred enbodiments, provides excellent humidit resistance, corrosion resistance, hardness, gloss and acid resistance. These advantages are illustrated in theExamples below. Typically, it is most preferred to cure at about 1500C for about 20 minutes. In addition to both improved storage stability and the ability to cure at reduced temperature, the coating compositions of the invention which incorporate polycarboxy functional polymeric catalyst have been found to provide a cured coating of advantageous physical properties when cured at any of a wide range of cure temperatures.More specifically, while, as noted above, the coating compositions according to preferred embodiments of the invention have been found to cure at advantageously low temperatures within short curing periods, yet, in addition, according to another highly advantageous aspect of the invention, the coating compositions can be cured without significant loss of advantageous physical properties at temperatures as high as about 1950C 3800F or more for periods up to about 60 minutes or more. Considered together with the storage stability of the coating composition, it can be readily recognized that the present invention provides a highly significant advance in the coating composition art.More specifically, it can be seen that great flexibility is provided by the coating compositions of the invention in both designing and implementing a curing schedule for the coating composition. Where the more preferred polycarboxy functional polymeric catalyst is not used in the coating composition, then it is preferred to use any of a variety of acid catalysts known to the skilled of the art to catalyse the aminoplast crosslinking reaction, for example, p toluenesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, phenyl acid phosphate, butyl phosphate, butyl maleate, and the like or a compatible mixture of any of them. However, an acid catalyst is most useful only for coating compositions intended for low temperature curing schedules and or when highly etherified melamine resins are used such as hexa methoxymethyl melamine or the like.Such catalysts are used in amounts which depend, in part, upon the intended baking curing schedule. Typically amounts of about 0.2 to about 3. are used, more preferably about 0.4 to about 0.6 by weight of total resin solids. In addition to catalyst, flow control agent s , for example, polybutyl acrylate wetting agent s , for example, silicone pigments pigment dispersants corrosion inhibitors, for example, chromate pigments, numerous of all of which are known to the skilled of the art, may be employed in the coating compositions of the invention. In addition, suitable reactive additives can be used, including, for example, low molecular weight diol flow control agents and reactive diluents. It will be within the skill of the art to determine the proper volatile organic content for a given coating composition of the invention and for a given application. Preferred solvents have relatively low volatility at temperatures appreciably below their boiling points such that solvent evaporation is low during storage and or application of the coating composition to the substrate. A suitable solvent system may include, for example, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, isobutyl acetate, xylene, cellosolve acetate, acetone and a mixture of any of them. Other solvents which may be employed include terpenes, aliphatic and aromatic naphthas, and the like.Additional suitable solvents are commercially available and will be apparent to the skilled of the art in view of the present disclosure. Generally it is preferred to employ a portion of C 4 to C S alcohol solvents such as, for example, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, and the like or a mixture of any of them since these inhibit the crosslinking reaction of the polyfunctional aminoplast resin with the epoxy ester resin at room temperature and thereby improve storage stability. At elevated temperature during cure, the alcohol solvent evaporates and, hence, ceases to inhibit the crosslinking reaction.Preferred solvents also may include, for example, methyl amyl ketone and the like, or a mixture thereof with C 4 toC 8 alcohol such as, for example, a 1 2 mixture by weight of butanol and methyl amyl ketone, respectively which is generally most preferred. Any solvent allowed to remain in the cured coating should be inert so as to avoid adverse effect upon the cured coating or upon another coating layer used in conjunction with it during the curing process or thereafter. Preferrahly, the cured coating is substantially free of solvent. Sufficient solvent is used to reduce the viscosity of the coating composition to a level suitable for storage or for application to the substrate in the desired manner. While conventional epoxy ester automotive spray applied primer coating compositions are known toi require a volatile organic content of about 540 g l, comparable coating compositions of the present invention require as little as 430 g l or less VOC to provide a viscosity of about 18 sec., 4 Ford Cup at 270C 80 OF , which is suitable for spray application techniques. It is generally preferred that sufficient solvent be used to provide a viscosity of about 18 to about 22 seconds, num 4Ford Cup at 270C 800F for a coating composition which is to be sprayed onto a substrate.Of course, the coating compositions of the invention need not be formulated as a high solids composition. Rather, it can have a higherVOC to provide a lower viscosity. Similarly, the coating compositions of the invention need not be formulated as a sprayable composition. Rather, it can have an even higher solids content and viscosity. In addition to the epoxy ester resin, polyfunctional aminoplast crosslinking agent and catalyst, if any, other components can be used such as flow control agent s , for example , polybutyl acrylate wetting agent s , for example, silicone pigments pigment dispersants corrosion ros ion inhibitors, for example, chromate pigments, numerous of all of which are known to the skilled of the art. In addition, suitable reactive additives can be used, including, for example, low molecular weight diol flow control agents and reactive diluents. According to another aspect of the invention, a coating on a substrate is provided, which coating comprises the crosslinked polymer product following cure of a coating composition of the invention. The coating composition can be a low solids composition, that is, it can have a high VOC, but generally a high solids composition, that is, one having a low VOC is preferred for the reasons given above. It can be applied by any conventional method, including brushing, dipping, flow coating, spraying, etc. Spraying will generally be preferred, for example, for applying the compositions as an automotive primer. For the reasons discussed above, the novel epoxy ester resins of the invention are especially advantageous for formulating high solids coating compositions.For this purposed, the epoxy ester resin of the invention preferably has a number average molecular weight Mn of about 1000 to about 3000. In this regard, coating compositions of the invention employing preferred epoxy ester resin, preferred crosslinking agent and preferred polymeric catalyst, as described above, are suitable to be applied to a substrate by spraying even though formulated at volatile organic content levels as low as about 347 470 g l 2.9 3.9 lb. gal. , a more preferred range being about 395 470 g l 3.3 3.9 lb. gal. . Curing the coating composition requires baking for sufficient time at sufficiently elevated temperature to react the crosslinking agent with the epoxy ester resins. The time and temperature required to cure the coating are interrelated and depend upon the particular epoxy ester resin, crosslinking agent, polymeric catalyst, solvent and other materials, if any, and the amount of each comprising the coating composition. Employing a volatile organic content of about 430 g l 3.6 lb. gal. and selecting preferred components as described above1 the bake time and temperature is typically about 15 to about 30 minutes and about 1350C 165 C 275 F 325 F , respectively.While the temperature required for cure can be reduced somewhat, for example to about 1200C 2500F for 15 to 30 minutes by addition of suitable catalyst, the coating compositions according to preferred embodiments of the invention, as described above, have been found to provide the best coating results when cured at temperature at about 1500C 3O00F for 20 minutes. It is a highly significant advantage of the invention, however, that these same coating compositions can withstand, for example, temperature as high as about 2000C 3900F for periods of time as long as about 60 minutes. Thus, as noted above, great flexibility is provided in both designing and implementing a curing schedule for parts coated with the coating compositions of the invention.Thus, in the assembly of automotive vehicles, for example, vehicles unavoidably held in a curing oven for long periods of time during unplanned assembly line shut downs are recovered with cured and unharmed coatings. High solids coating compositions according to the present invention, comprising the preferred epoxy ester resins described above, melamine and catalyst especially the preferred polycarboxy functional polymeric catalyst have been found to afford cured coatings with corrosion resistance comparable to conventional epoxy ester based, low solids sprayable coating compositions. The significant reduction in volatile organic content presents, therefore, a highly advantageous advance in the art. A most preferred use of the coating composition of the invention is as a high solids sprayable primer for use on a bare metal substrate such as a household or industrial applicance housing or an automotive vehicle body. Primer compositions typically are pigmented and any pigments commonly included in primer compositions for metal substrates and acrylic dispersion topcoats such as, for example, carbon black, iron oxide, lithopone, magnesium, silicate, silica, barium sulfate, TiO2, chrome yellow, calcium chromate, strontium chromate, zinc potassium chromate any the like may be used. The primer can be pigmented according to known methods including, for example, by grinding pigments in a portion of the curable resin and adding to the primer composition. The pigment to binder ratio of the primer may be as much as 4 1 by weight, respectively, depending, in part, upon the condition of the metal substrate. It is.preferred, however, to use a primer having a pigment to binder ratio of about 1 1 2 1 by weight, respectively. No special expedients are necessary in formulating the primer compositions of this invention.For example, they may be prepared simply by incorporating the resinous components in a suitable solvent system.Thus, for example, by suitable mixing or agitation, each resinous component may be dissolved in a solvent and the resulting solutions combined to form finished primer compositions. The solvent system may be any suitable combination of organic solvents as described above. For a high solids, sprayable, automotiv.e vehicle primer, the solvent will comprise preferably about 25 to about 35 percent by weight of the total coating compositions, although of course, larger or smaller amounts may be utilized depending upon the solids content desired. For example, it may be desirable to formulate the primer with a relatively high solids content and then reduce it to spraying consistency prior to the time of application. The metal substrate can be, for example, aluminum, steel, or phosphated cold rolled steel.However, any metal used as a construction material is usable. The primer composition may. be coated onto the metal base in any conventional manner such as roll coating, brushing, curtain coating, etc. The preferred method of applying the primer composition to the metal is by spraying. The primer is cured at elevated temperatures by any convenient means such as baking ovens or banks of infra red heat lamps. Suitable curing temperatures are discussed above. The primer is generally thinned to from about 60 to about 70 percent solids content for spraying purposes with conventional thinners such as aromatic hydrocarbons, commercial petroleum cuts which are essentially aromatic, and the like, and sprayed onto the metal base and cured.The primer is cured at elevated temperatures by any convenient means such as baking ovens or banks of infra red heat lamps. Suitable curing temperatures are as described above. Curing temperatures are preferably from about 1350C to about 165 OC, although curing temperatures from about 1000C to about 2300C may be employed, if desired. The invention will be further understood by referring to the following detailed examples. It should be understood that the specific examples are presented by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Unless otherwise specified, all references to parts , are intended to mean parts by weight. EXAMPLE I This example illustrates the preparation of an epoxy ester resin according to the present invention. In a suitable reactor were charged 1248 parts of Epon 829 trademark Shell Chemical Company diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A , 342 parts of bisphenol A, 463 parts of Empol 1014 trademark Emery Industries, Inc. dimer acid and 1400 parts of Soya fatty acid.
