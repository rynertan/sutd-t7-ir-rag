# VARIABLE DELAY LINE

## Abstract
A delay line circuit 20 provides variable delay and phase shift to electric signals propagating along the delay circuit. The circuit is formed of a set of varactors construct ed either as varactor chips 42 or as a set of mesas 84 up standing from a gallium arsenide substrate 86 . A ground plane 34 interconnects bottom terminals of the varactor chips while a strip line conductor 46, 96 interconnects top terminals of the varactor chips. In the case of the mesa con figuration, a metallized layer 88 covers the regions be tween the mesas without contacting the base portions of the mesas. The strip line conductor makes contact with the re spective mesas via a set of metallic posts 92 upstanding from respective ones of the mesas. Dielectric material air space may be inserted between the strip line conductor and the metallic layer to position the strip line conductor re lative to the metallic layer, which layer serves as a ground plane in a transmission line comprising the strip line con ductor.
