# Flowmeter.

## Abstract
A flowmeter for measuring flow of fuel to a combustion engine comprises a transducer including a turbine 9 the vanes of which interrupt the light between a light source and a photosensitive device when the turbine rotates, the transducer being mounted with its axis vertical for fuel to flow upwardly past the turbine, a swirl chamber 4 for eliminating gas and vapour bubbles from the fuel before it enters the transducer, and a non return valve 28 to prevent reverse flow of fuel through the transducer.
