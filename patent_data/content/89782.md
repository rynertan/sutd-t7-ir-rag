## Abstract
This invention relates to implantable porous prostheses for use as bone or hard tissue replacements anywhere in the body. The porous implants comprise loose, individual polymeric particles of a specified size, coated with a hydrophilic material and barium sulfate particles. The pros theses are biologically compatible in the body and promote bone and tissue ingrowth and attachment. This invention also relates to a method for producing the novel prosthetic devices disclosed herein.
