# Apparatus for measuring the cut off wavelength of a single mode optical fiber.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring the cut off wavelength of a single mode optical fiber includes two fiber bending devices one of which provides the fiber, during test, with a large radius bend and the other of which provides the fiber, during test, with a small radius bend. The outputs from the fiber during the large and small radius bending are compared in order to precisely measure the cut off wavelength.
