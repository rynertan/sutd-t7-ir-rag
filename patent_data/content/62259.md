# Multilayer composite sheet useful as a substrate for artificial leather.

## Abstract
A multilayer compsite sheet useful as a substrate for artificial leather, comprises at least three fibrous layers, namely, a superficial layer A consisting of a spun laid web composed of extremely fine fibers having an average denier of 0.5 or less and three dimensionally entangled with each other and intermediate layer B consisting of a web of staple fibers having a length of 50 mm or less and entangled together and a base layer C consisting of a woven or knitted fabric, the above mentioned three fibrous layers being superimposed on each other and combined together in such a manner that a portion of the fibers in each layer penetrates into the adjacent layers and becomes entangled three dimensionally with the fibers in the adjacent layers.
