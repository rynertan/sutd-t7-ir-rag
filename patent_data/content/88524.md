# Intruder alarm system.

## Abstract
An intruder alarm system includes a number of sensors each of which comprises first and second series connected resistances and a sensor switch connected in parallel with the first resistance. The first resistances of each sensor are different in value from one another, but their values are related in a known manner. The sensors are connected in series with one another by a connecting cable and to a constant current source. The voltage developed across the series connected sensors is applied to a circuit arrange ment operable to offset the effect of the total resistance of the second resistances of each sensor and of the connect ing cable. An analogue to digital converter is responsive to the output of the circuit arrangement to deliver a digital output to an indicator which indicates the actuation of any sensor.
