# Process for producing hydrocarbon fluoride.

## Abstract
A process for producing a hydrocarbon fluoride at a high selectivity with minimum formation of by products is dis closed, which comprises reacting a hydrogen containing hydrocarbon halide with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride in a liquid phase in the presence of a reaction production of i at least one of a an oxygen containing compound selected from the group consisting of H₂O, H₂O₂ and an oxygen containing organic compound, and b a nitrogen containing compound selected from the group consisting of NH₃ and a nitrogen containing organic compound, ii a tin compound selected from the group consisting of a stannic halide, a stannic oxyhalide and an organotin compound, and iii anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.
