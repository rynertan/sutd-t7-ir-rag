## Description
METHOD OF AND PLANT FOR MANUFACTURING PULVEROUSOR GRANULAR MATERIAL, FOR EXAMPLE CEMENT. The invention relates to the manufacture of pulverous or granular materials, for example cement, in accordance with the so called dry process . The dry process may be carried out in a kiln plant which has a kiln, a cooler coupled after the kiln for cooling the product treated in the kiln and two preheaters, one of which is heated by means of the kiln exit gases and the other one of which is heated by means of spent cooling air from the cooler. The raw material treated in the preheater and heated by the kiln exit gases may either be passed directly from the preheater to the kiln or via a precalciner coupled to the preheater for precalcining the raw materials after their preheating.Such preheaters, which are knownper se and are for example shaft preheaters or cyclone preheaters, together with their outlet and inlet pipes and fans are herein respectively referred to as the kiln string , i.e. the preheater or preheaters heated by the kiln exit gases, and the cooling air string , i.e. the preheater or preheaters heated by spent cooling air from the cooler. The cooler may preferably be a grate cooler such as is commonly used in such plants, especially with the cement industry. This type of ccn er has, unfortunately, the the disadva ntage tht it tt uires an amount of cooling air significantly exceeding the amount of combustion air needed for use in the combustion process in the kiln and possibly also the pre calciner. Thus, there is excess air emitted from the cooler which represents a considerable heat loss and also a serious problem of dedusting and consequential pollution. Similar problems may arise when using other cooler types than grate coolers. According to the invention in a method of manufacturing pulverous or granular material, such as cement, in a kiln plant comprising a kiln for burning and sintering of raw materials, a cooler coupled after the kiln for cooling the product treated in the kiln, a first raw material preheater heated by kiln exit gases, and a second raw material preheater heated by spent cooling air from the cooler, substantially the whole of the air used in the second preheater and cooled therein as a result of the preheating of the raw material in the preheater is returned to the cooler in which it is reused for cooling the kiln product. The invention also includes a kiln plant for carrying o t the above method, the kiln plant comprising a kiln for burning and sintering of raw materials, a cooler coupled after the kiln for cooling the product from the kiln, a first raw material preheater heated by kiln exit gases, a second raw material preheater heated by spent cooling air from the cooler and means for returning substantially the whole of the cooled air from the second preheater to the cooler for reuse in cooling the kiln product. Preferably, all the raw material is fed to the second preheater and after preheating in the second preheater is subsequently passed direct to the first preheater for further treatment therein. If desired, the preheated raw material from the first preheater may be precalcined in a precalciner before being passed to the kiln. Alternatively, the supply of raw material may be apportioned between the two preheaters. Furthermore, some of the heated raw material from the second preheater could be passed direct to the precalciner or kiln, thus bypassing the first preheater. By the method of the invention the whole S the excess air from a grate cooler can be utilized, the air being used partly in the kiln and partly in the second preheater so that the heat loss problem is considerably reduced and the dedusting problem eliminated, the spent cooling air following a substantially closed circuit from the cooler through the cooling air stream preheater and back to the cooler, cooling of the air being achieved in the preheater by its giving off heat to the raw material. Fresh cooling air for supplementing the return air can be supplied to the cooler in the usual way. Thus, with a plant according to the invention, the dust precipitator capacity in the plant can be considerably reduced and, furthermore, plant economy is improved. One example of a plant according to the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawing. The plant has two preheater strings, a kiln string A and a cooling air string B. The kiln stringA comprises a preheater 1 and a precalciner 2 and the cooling air string B has a preheater 9. In use, all the raw material to be treated in the plant is fed to the preheater 9 through a pipe 10 and is preheated by spent cooling air passed to the preheater 9 from the cooler 7 by way of a pipe 8.The air passed to the preheater is hot, having been used to cool raw material from the kiln 3 and, after heating the raw material fed to the preheater 9 leaves the preheater through a pipe 11 and is returned by way of a fan 12 to the cooler 7. If necessary, cold air is added at 22 to the returning air in the pipe 11.By means of a fan 14 additional atmospheric air further necessary for cooling in the cooler can be inputed through the pipe 13. The raw material preheated in the preheater 9 is passed from the bottom of the preheater through a pipe 16 by means of a pump 15 to the top of the preheater 1 for treatment therein. The raw material passes through the preheater 1 to the precalciner 2 to which combustion air is supplied through a riser pipe 4 from the kiln 3 and through a pipe 20 from the cooler 7. Thus, the total amount of air supplied to the cooler is split between the preheater strings A and B, that passing through the string B being recirculated. Fuel for the precalciner 2 is supplied at 21.Preheated and precalcined material is passed from the precalciner 2 to the kiln inlet though a tube 5 and the kiln exit gases are extracted from the preheater 1 through the pipe 17 by means of a fan 18 and are then passed to a dust precipitator not shown . In the kiln the preheated and precalcined material is sintered and further treated by being burnt in the kiln by means of a burner 6 at the lower end of the kiln. The treated material then passes to the cooler 7 in which it is cooled by the cold air and leaves the cooler through an outlet 19. Calculations have shown that given an air temperature of approximately 3500 C in the pipe 8 and a consumption of 1.0keg air kg clinker, the temperature of the preheated raw material in the pipe 16 will be approximately 1800C, compared to approximately 60 C which is the normal temperature of raw material feed from a storage silo to a preheater. The temperature of the exit gases from the preheater A will be approximately 45O0C. Thus, it can be seen that a substantial reduction in the he loss can be achieved.
