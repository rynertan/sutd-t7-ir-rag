# PLL control circuit.

## Abstract
A phase locked loop PLL control circuit for a digital audio disk system is disclosed which has a voltage controlled oscillator VCO 116 , a reference signal generator 106 for generating a reference signal corresponding to the phase state of a digital audio signal when the digital audio signal is reproduced or read out and which is recorded on a digital audio disk DAD 54 to have a maximum or minimum inverting period value predetermined by the eight to fourteen modulation EFM method, a phase comparator 110 connected to the output terminal of the reference signal generator 106 and the VCO 116 , a detector 122 for detecting the maximum inverting period value included in the digital audio signal and an adder 112 for adding outputs from the phase comparator 110 and the detector 122 and for supplying a sum result as an oscillation control signal to the VCO 116 .
