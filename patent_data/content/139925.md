# Automatic amplitude equalizer.

## Abstract
An automatic amplitude equalizer for magnetic recording channels is disclosed which utilizes a readback training sequ ence, monitors the total power lost during the training sequ ence due to channel variations, and automatically adjusts the channel signal in response to the power loss factor. The signal read from a tape is amplified and then partially corrected in a conventional fixed equalizer. The equalizer signal is fed to a second equalizer capable of effecting auto matic adjustment. The figure shows the new automatic equal izer which adds the necessary additional compensation. The input signal is supplied to summing amplifier 52 which also receives a second input from the multiplying digital to analog converter 50 and second derivative circuit 51 . The multipli cation factor, and thus the amount of additional compensa tion, is determined by the counter 53 . The counter is initially set to zero and incremented by pulses from AND gate 54 when the output of comparator 55 is high. Correct compen sation has been achieved when the ratio of the low frequency power and the high frequency power is equal to g, as preset in the gain compensation circuit 61 .
