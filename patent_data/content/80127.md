# Apparatus for measuring tire uniformity.

## Abstract
The tire T for automobiles being measured is loaded in advance by the load applying means 14 and the drum 11 is driven to rotate the tire. A displacement of the rotat able shaft 12 produced in response to a variation in the radial force acting between the tire and the drum is detected as a displacement of the movable member 13 . The mov able member is movable with respect to the drum about a fulcrum which lies in or is located in the vicinity of a plane including a surface in which the drum and the tire are held against each other. Thus any influence by a moment due to a lateral force imposed on the tire can be eliminated, and the apparatus can measure a radial force variation with precision.
