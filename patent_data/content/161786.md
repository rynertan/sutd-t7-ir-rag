# System for securing a railway rail to a railway sleeper.

## Abstract
A system for securing a railway rail 11 to a railway sleeper 12 which comprises a base plate 13 and two spring clips 14 . The rail 11 is received in a central portion 21 of the base plate. The spring clips 14 are generally chevron shaped and extend through a yoke defined on either side of the base plate 14 so that two toes of the chevron 31,32 engage the rail flange 15 while the heel 33 of the chevron engages the base plate.

## Description
SYSTEM FOR SECURING A RAILWAY RAIL TO A RAILWAY SLEEPER The present application relates to the securing of a railway rail to a railway sleeper particularly by means of a spring clip and a baseplate. In certain railway applications, e.g. in mines, conventional symmetrical section rails are being replaced by asymmetrical trapped conventional .ATC rails which have an elongated outer rail head section. This form of section enables rail vehicles to employ brake mechanisms which run alongside and beneath the elongated section and whidi grip this section when the brakes are applied. However, conventional systems for securing the rails to the sleepers are frequently unsuitable since the clips extend upwards too far and so tend to foul the braking mechanism. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system for attaching a rail to a sleeper which does not foul a braking mechanism which acts directly on the rail. It is a further object of the invention to provide such a system which may be easily assembled and dis assembled. According to the invention there is provided a system for securing a railway rail to a railway sieeper which comprises a baseplate and two spring clips, the baseplate including a central region arranged to receive the rail and dn each side of the central region a lateral region, each lateral region having a yoke adjacent the central region and a generally planar portion extending away from the yoke, each sprint clip being so dimensioned to extend beneath the yoke and to engage the flange of the rail, the undersurface of the yoke and the planar portion of the lateral portion of the base plate. Being totally above the sleeper, this fastening assembly can be very easily assembled or taken apart in situ . It also offers the distinct advantage of being a very low assembly, thereby enabling other moving or fixed components to use or be attached to the rail without obstruction. Thus, the under rail height is very small and it has been found that the system can provide high toe loads and good creep properties.It is therefore particularly suitable in applications involving either ATC rail used in mines or rail trackwork switches, crossings and turnouts. The sleeper may be of any type such as concrete, metal or timber, and the baseplate may be attached to it by any suitabie means such as bolts screws or nails.Thus the baseplate may have holes or other facilities enabling it to be screwed to timber ties or sleepers or otherwise suitably fixed to steel or other sleepers or trackway bases. Preferably, the baseplate is of mild steel and pressed to shape as a single component. Thus, preferably, the yoke on each side is formed by an inverted U raised section or an upward fold in the baseplate parallel with the intended position of the rail, and a slot on each side of the fold defining the yoke. The e slot length is preferably only marginally longer than the width of the spring clip so as to prevent any tendency for the clip to twist horizontally. The underside of the top length of one or both slots may act as the reaction point to the upper surface of the assembled clip. Preferably, each end of the baseplate has a turned up portion. This turned up portion may act as a positive lock confirming when the clip is in the correctly assembled position. Preferably, each spring clip is of spring steel and is preferably generally chevron shaped so that one end terminates in a V while at the other end there is a corresponding V cut out to define two toes. Preferably, the V end and the two toes are turned up to facititate assembly through the baseplate slots and on to the rail foot. Although the spring clip may be rectangular, the chevron shape is preferred since it can enable the spring clip to absorb higher stresses safely and can accommodate slight mis alignments of the rail and clip. Dependent upon the rail section and baseplate length, the clip may be suitably shaped to ensure that the correct toe load pressure is applied to the rail foot when components are fully assembled. The invention may be carried into practice in various ways and one embodiment will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a vertical section through an assembled system in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 is a plan view of the right hand spring clip shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a plan view of a baseplate. As shown in Figure 1, a rail 11 is secured to a sleeper 12 by means of a baseplate 13 and a pair of spring clips 14. The rail 11 is generally I shaped in section but is asymmetrical. Thus it has two similar flanges 15 constituting the rail foot but the head section comprises a short thick inner rail head 16 and athinner elongated outer rail head 17. The baseplate 13 shown in Figures 1 and 3 is of mild steel and generally rectangular in shape. It has a central portion 21, whose width is the same or a little greater than that of the rail foot 15, 15 on each side, of the central portion 21, an inverted U section fold 22, and beybnd the folds 22 a generally planar extension 23. Each fold 22 has a pair of parallel slots 24 one in each inclined face. The central part 25 at the end of each extension 23 is turned upwards and two holes 26 are formed in each extension 23 to receive bolts not shown to attach the baseplate 13 to the sleeper 12. The spring clip 14 is a generally flate chevronshaped plate of spring steel as shown in Figure 2.The clip comprises a pair of toes 31,32 defined by a V shaped cut out and a heel 33 in the form of a. correspondingly V shaped protrusion. The ends 34 of the toes 31,32 and heel 33 are upturned. The complementary nature of the V shapes minimises material wastage in forming the plates. To effect assembly, the baseplate 13 is suitably secured to the positioned sleeper 12 and the rail 11 is positioned correctly on the central portion 21 of the baseplate 13. One end of a clip 14 is then introduced through the baseplate slots 24 ta rest on the rail flange 15. The rear end of the clip 14 is driven by a hammer or some other means up over the turned up central part 25 of the baseplate end, and is thus prevented from returning by this central part 25. Tension is produced within the clip 14 between this point, the reaction point at the underside of the inverted U 22 between the two slots and the contact point of the clip 14 with the rail flange 15, this tension ensures the correct toe load is applied on the rail flange 15. This is then repeated with the other clip 14 on the other side of the baseplate 13. In order to remove the spring clip 14 from the assembled position shown in Figure 1, a suitably shaped lever is located on end of the clip 14 at the rail foot and against the rail head and pressure is applied to the clip end to drive the clip 14 out.
