## Description
NOVEL CRYSTALLINE MICROPOROUS TEREE DEMENSIONALLY ORDERED SOLID The present invention relates to a novel crystalline microporous three dimensionally ordered solid. Crystalline microporous three dimensionally ordered solids are known. A major class of such solids are the zeolites which are found in nature and can also be synthesised. Typical examples of such solids are the mineral, faujasite, and the synthetic zeolites, Types X and Y. Such aluminosilicates are composed of rigid three dimensional networks of SiO4 and A104 tetrahedra crosslinked by the sharing of oxygen atoms such that the ratio of the total aluminium and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminium is balanced by the inclusion of cations in the pores of the three dimensional structure. The aluminosilicate framework in the synthetic zeolites X and Y consists of linked, truncated octahedra, otherwise referred to as sodalite cages, which are joined tetrahedrally through 6 membered rings.The linkage between adjoining truncated octahedra is a double 6 membered ring or hexagonal prism, containing 12 Si,Al 04 tetrahedra. There are 16 of these prisms in each unit cell which is cubic with a very large cell dimension of nearly 25t. The unit cell contains eight large cavities, generally referred to as supercages , each with a free diameter of about 13t. Mutually intersecting channels consisting of the 13t cavities separated by apertures with a free diameter of about 8t and formed by a somewhat distorted 12 membered ring run through the structure in the 110 direction.The unusually stable and rigid framework structure of the synthetic zeolites X and Y involves the largest void space of any known zeolite and amounts to about 51 volume percent of the crystal when dehydrated. As a consequence of the large void space zeolites X and Y find utility as molecular sieves in adsorption and catalyst applications. In these materials however the apertures and supercages are not linked in a repetitive linear manner with the result that the free flow of adsorbed molecules into and desorbed molecules out of the structure is considerably impeded. A crystalline microporous three dimensionally ordered solid in which apertures and cages are linearly arranged in a repetitive manner to form an elongated hypercage has now been synthesised. Accordingly the present invention provides a crystalline microporous three dimensionally ordered solid having the generalised atomic formula It P X02 p .9 Y02 .wH20 I wherein M is at least one cation, X is at least one of aluminium, gallium or indium, Y is at least one of silicon, germanium or tin, p is the valence of the cation, q has a value such that the ratio of q to p lies in the range 1 1 to 150 1 and w is an integer in the range from 0 to 260, which solid has a unit cell of hexagonal symmetry the principal characteristics of which are a 17.5 O.5t c 85.6 o.sA, and a unit cell volume 22600 t 10A3. In the formula I M may suitably be a monovalent cation such as an alkali metal cation, eg lithium, sodium or potassium, or a divalent cation such as an alkaline earth metal cation, eg calcium or magnesium, or a trivalent cation such as a rare earth metal cation, eg lanthanum. The monovalent cation may also be a hydrogen ion or an ammonium ion. Alternatively the solid may contain a mixture of cations provided that the electroneutrality of the solid is preserved. The cations can be replaced by ion exchange techniques well known in the art. The cation or cations may be replaced by cations which render the solid catalytically active, especially for hydrocarbon conversion.Such cations include hydrogen, rare earth and metals of Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VE, VIB and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements as published in the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 60th Edition, 1980. In the formula I X is either aluminium, gallium, or indium andY is either silicon, germanium or tin, preferably silicon or germanium. For the sake of simplicity the description hereinafter will only refer to the case wherein X is aluminium and Y is silicon.This is in no way intended to restrict the invention to these particular elements. Preferably the ratio of q to p in the formula I is in the range from 1 1 to 100 1, even more preferably from 1 1 to 60 1, most preferably from 1 1 to 15 1. The framework of the novel solid is composed of the same building units as are to be found in natural faujasite and synthetic zeolites X and Y hereinafter referred to as faujasite type solids , ie sodalite cages linked by double 6 membered rings or hexagonal prisms, but the units are combined in a different manner to form a new structure.This new structure arises because of recurrent twinning on the 111 plane involving reflection across a mirror plane intersecting the supercages and passing through the double 6 membered rings between sodalite cages. Such twinning gives rise to tubular hypercages as distinct from the near spherical supercages found in the faujasitetype structure. The regular faujasite type may be represented byEMI3.1 where each 6 denotes a unit repeat along 111 . The novel structure contains the sequenceEMI3.2 ...etc. which signifies that a twin lamella,V, bounded by a twin plane denoted by the vertical line on each side is introduced between each flanking pair of faujasite type repeat units along 111 , thereby generating hypercages . The length of each hypercage is ca. 52 and the extent to which the new microporous solid is occupied by connected hypercages depends upon the extent of twinning. The twinning may occur over substantially the entire crystal in the 111 direction or a major proportion of the crystal in the 111 direction. When a different twinning sequenceEMI3.3 is generated the hypercage extends for the entire length of the recurrent twin in the 111 direction. Thus if there are n twin planes and when this kind of recurrent twinning is extensive n large the length of the hypercage now effectively a tunnel becomes 14.26no. The dimensions of the framework apertures, viewed along the 111 twinned crystal are significantly different from those viewed along the 110 plane in faujasite type solids. Whilst the radius of the opening of the supercage in faujasite type solids is 7.4t, the twinned structure is elliptical with the longitudinal and transverse diameters being about 7.4it and about 6.9t respectively. The novel solid may be synthesised for example by subjecting a faujasite type solid to deformation at an elevated pressure and at a temperature below its melting point. The faujasite type solid may be for example faujasite itself, zeolite X, zeolite Y or dealuminised forms of these materials.Moreover the faujasite type solid may be cation exchanged if so desired. By the dealuminised form is meant a form in which the ratio of the number of atoms of silicon to the number of atoms of aluminium is increased by removal of aluminium atoms. This may suitably be accomplished by treating the solid with for example silicon tetrachloride vapour in the manner described in Catalysis byZeolites , Volume 5 in Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis, published by Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company at page 203 byHermann K. Beyer and Ita Belenykaja. The elevated pressure may suitably be generated mechanically. Preferably the pressure is hydrostatic pressure. Suitably the pressure may be up to 50 bars or 100 bars or more. The elevated temperature is preferably in the vicinity of 0.7 to 0.8 of the melting point of the faujasite type solid, though lower temperatures may be employed. The temperature must not be above the melting point otherwise the crystalline structure is destroyed. Thus lanthanum exchanged zeolite Y may suitably be deformed at a temperature of about 8000C. The time for which the solid is subjected to the deforming pressure may suitably be at least 30 minutes. The novel solid is useful as an adsorbent and may be used as a catalyst or as a catalyst support in hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following Example. In the Example reference will be made to the use of high resolution electron microscopy HREM in the structural determination.

A. Lodge and J. M. Thomas. Optical transforms were routinely used for further ananlysis of high resolution micrographs by the method described in Nature, 289, 157 158 1981 .Example 1 gram of commercial zeolite Linde Y sodium form was treated in a teflon autoclave with 7 g of lanthanum chloride dissolved in 50 ml of water. The ion exchange process was at 1000C for the period of 24 hours, after which time the solid was filtered off, washed repeatedly with distilled water, and the procedure repeated. The product, after washing, was dried in a furnace in air at 4500C for 12 hours and transferred into a gold cartridge which was then welded in a dry box filled with dry argon, so that no water could be absorbed by the product. The cartridge was then placed inside a high temperature device in which heat and hydrostatic pressure could be simultaneously applied. The cartridge was heated to 800 10C and a hydrostatic pressure of 100 1 bar applied for a period of 30 minutes from the moment the final temperature was reached.The pressure was then released, the gold cartridge opened and the solid examined by high resolution electron microscopy HREM . A pre evacuated sample was rapidly tilted into the appropriate orientation in the microscope using a JEOL 200CX side entry goniometer. The objective lens spherical aberration coefficient was 2.5 mm, and images were recorded for the optimum lens defocus condition. Optical transoms were routinely used for further analysis of the high resolution micrographs. The images showed evidence of twinning on 111 planes. The structure was established to be hexagonal. Its principal characteristics are a 17.46 c 85.56 Unit cell volume 22604 3 In order to better illustrate the novel structure the followingFigures are provided Figure 1 is a photograph of a scalar model of the novel structure viewed down the axis. The hypercage is clearly visible in the centre of the photograph. Figure 2 is a photograph of a scalar model showing a connected cross hatched cubooctahedra as seen when the novel structure is sighted along very nearly the 112 direction. The apertures in view are elliptical as indicated.
