## Description
PREPARATION OF 4 SUBSTITUTED 3 PYRAZOLIDINONES This invention relates to a process for preparing 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones which are useful as electron transfer agents in color diffusion transfer photography. Many different methods for preparing 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones are known in the art. U.S.Patent 2,289,367 and European Patent 54,002 describe methods comprising reaction of a substituted hydrazine with a B halogenated or ss hydroxy acid chloride or carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an acrylate ester is reacted with a substituted aromatic amine, then nitrosated and hydrolyzed to form the 3 pyrazolidinone. A problem associated with these and other known methods is that they are impractical or impossible to use for preparing complex 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones. The use of ss halogenated or ss hydroxy acid chloride equivalents or acrylate starting materials require that the final 4 substituent of the pyrazolidinone be compatible with the harsh reaction conditions of the entire reaction sequence, so that relatively few 4 substituted 3pyrazolidinones have previously been prepared.Further, acrylate starting materials cannot be directly used to prepare 4,4 disubstituted pyrazolidinones. A series of 4 substituted 3pyrazolidinones cannot be prepared from a common intermediate by the prior art processes, so that each derivative requires its own long synthetic sequence.Further still, these known processes result in poor product yield. Thus, there is a need for a relatively direct, high yield process for the preparation of 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones. The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones which avoids the disadvantages of the prior art processes discussed above. This object is achieved by the process of the invention, which process is characterized by 1 reacting A a compound having the structural formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 R2 R3, R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen fluorine allyl trimethylsilyl benzyl substituted or unsubstituted alkyl alkoxy or thioalkoxy R3 and R2 may be taken together with carbon atoms in the phenyl ring to which they are attached to form a cyclic ring or R3 and R4 may be taken together with the carbon atoms at the 4 and 5 positions of the pyrazolidinone ring to form a cyclic ring and, J is a removable blocking group the compound being stable at a temperature equal to or less than 00C in the presence of a strong base having a pKa greater than 20 with B an electrophilic moiety at a temperature equal to or less than OOC in the presence of a strong base having a pKa greater than 20, whereby said electrophilic moiety selectively adds to the C atom at the 4 position in the pyrazolidinone ring and 2 removing the blocking group.A wide variety of 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones, including complex 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones and 4,4 disubstituted 3 pyrazolidinones, may be prepared by the process of the invention, many of which have been impractical or impossible to prepare by previously known methods. In addition, the final 4 substituent of the pyrazolidinone prepared by the process of the invention need only be compatible with the reaction conditions of the relatively direct process disclosed herein. Further, a series of 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones can be prepared from a single intermediate preformed pyrazolidinone and the relatively direct process of the present invention results in high yields of 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones. As described above, R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are independently hydrogen fluorine allyl trimethylsilyl benzyl alkyl, preferably containing 1 to 7 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, unsubstituted or substituted with groups such as hydroxyl alkoxy, such as methoxy or ethoxy or thioalkoxy, such as thiomethoxy or thioethoxy R1 and R2 may be taken together with carbon atoms in the phenyl ring to which they are attached to form a cyclic ring, e.g., R1 and R2 may represent an alkylene group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methylene, ethylene, propylene or butylene, optionally having 1 or more oxygen atoms in the group with or without additional unsaturation or R3 and R4 may be taken together with the carbon atoms at the 4 and 5 positions of the pyrazolidinone ring to form a cyclic ring, e.g., R3 and R4 may represent an alkylene group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methylene, ethylene, propylene or butylene, optionally having 1 or more oxygen atoms in the group with or without additional unsaturation. Preferred blocked intermediates, which are stable at a temperature of less than OOC and in the presence of a strong base having a pKa greater than 20, are formed by two alternative embodiments of the invention. The first embodiment comprises reacting a 3 pyrazolidinone having the structural formula EMI4.1 wherein R1, Ri, R3, R4 and R5 are defined as above, with a blocking group providing composition comprising t butyl dimethylsilyl chloride benzyl bromide or N,N disubstituted carbamoyl chloride.The above blocking group providing compositions when reacted with a 3 pyrazolidinone in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention result in good yield of the O blocked silyl and N,N disubstituted carbamoyl intermediates and the N blocked benzyl intermediate. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, J in the above formula may be either EMI5.1 wherein R6 and R7 are independently methyl, phenyl orEMI5.2 The 3 pyrazolidinones described above may be written in the keto form as EMI5.3 or in the enol form as EMI5.4 As used herein the keto form is meant to include the enol form and vice versa. A common method for preparing the 3 pyrazolidinones described above involves reaction of a a substituted hydrazine with a 13 halogenated or B hydroxy acid chloride or carboxylic acid.Variations of this method and other methods useful for preparing these compounds are detailed in U.S. Patents 2,289,367, 2,688,024, 2,704,762, 2,772,282, 2,843,598, 3,166,568, 3,330,839, and 4,074,051. The second embodiment for preparing the blocked intermediate is formed by reacting a 3 chloro 2 pyrazoline having the structural formula EMI6.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are defined as above, with a blocking group providing composition comprising potassium benzyloxide. The 3 chloro 2 pyrazoline described above preferably is formed by reacting a 3 pyrazolidinone having the structural formula EMI7.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and Rs are defined as above, with an acid chloride such as phosgene in an inert solvent in the presence of a base. The reaction is advantageously completed in 1 to 24 hours at a temperature of 200C to 700C at about atmospheric pressure. This embodiment is preferred when the intermediate blocked by a benzyl group at the 3 position of the N containing ring is prepared. This intermediate is desirable because the benzyl blocking group is more readily removable therefrom by hydrogenolysis after addition thereto of an electrophilic moiety as compared to the N blocked benzyl intermediates. The intermediates described above must be stable at a temperature equal to or less than 0 C and in the presence of a strong base having a pKa greater than 20. Surprisingly, these blocked intermediates are stable under the harsh reaction conditions required to permit an electrophilic moiety to add to the C atom at the 4 position in the N containing ring. These blocking groups can be removed after addition of the electrophilic moiety to form the desired 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinone product in high yield. When reacted with a 3 pyrazolidinone or a 2 pyrazoline, many blocking groups form intermediates which are not stable at a temperature less than 200C and in the presence of a strong base having a pKa greater than 20. For example, reacting trimethylsilylchloride with a 3 pyrazolidinone yields a trimethylsilyl iminoether blocked intermediate. However, this species does not survive the harsh reaction conditions required to permit an electrophilic moiety to selectively add to the C atom at the 4 position.Other blocking group providing compounds, such as acetylphenidone, are not operable despite formation of an intermediate stable at temperatures below OOC in a strong base. This is because the initial blocking reaction yields a mixture of isomers and very harsh reaction conditions must be employed to remove the blocking group after alkylation has occurred, often resulting in decomposition of the newly formed species. Thus, useful blocking group providing compositions are those which will yield an intermediate stable not only at a temperature less than OOC, but also in the presence of a strong base having a pKa greater than 20 and must also form an intermediate containing a blocking group that is readily removable. As described above, the intermediate is reacted with an electrophilic moiety at a temperature less than OOC in the presence of a strong base having a pKa greater than 20. When intermediates corresponding to the above structural formulas are formed in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, an electrophilic moiety selectively adds to the C atom at the 4 position under the above described conditions. Electrophilic moieties useful herein are described in Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, by J. March, 2ndEd., 1977, McGraw Hill Book Co. The electrophilic moiety attaches to the C atom at the 4 position through a single bond or through a double bond as follows EMI9.1 wherein E represents an electrophilic moiety, and Rl, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are defined as above. The electrophilic moiety is provided by an electrophile reagent. Electrophile reagents are known to those skilled in the art. A partial listing of electrophile reagents useful in the practice of the invention comprises allyl and benzyl halides such as allyl chloride, allyl bromide, l bromo 4 methyl but2 ene, l bromo but 2 ene cis and or trans , and benzyl bromide and substituted benzyl bromides alkyl halides such as methyl chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, ethyl chloride, ethyl bromide, 1,2 dibromoethane, n propylbromide, i propyliodide, n butyl iodide, 1 bromo 3 t butyldimethylsilyloxy propane, n hexyliodide and 2 bromohexane epoxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, isobutylene oxide, n butylene oxide and 1,2 epoxyethylbenzene aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, benzaldehyde, methoxy acetaldehyde, and d methyl ami noacetal dehyd ketones such as acetone, acetophenone, 2 butanone, cyclohexanone and dimethylaminoacetone acyl halides and derivatives such as acetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, N,N dimethylformamide, ethyl acetate and methyl chloroformamide chloromethyl ethers such as chloromethyl ether, chloromethyl isobutyl ether and chloromethoxy ether and silyl halides and derivatives such as trimethylsilyl chloride, t butyl dimethylsilylchloride and chloromethyl trimethylsilane. Certain electrophile providing reagents, recognized by those skilled in the art, such as acetyl chloride comprise divalent electrophile moieties.When such electrophile providing reagents are reacted with the intermediate, a first electrophilic moiety attaches to the 4 position of a first molecule of the intermediate. As a result, a second electrophile is revealed, which adds selectively to the 4 position of a second molecule of the intermediate. Thus, a single molecule of the electrophile providing reagent can react with 2 molecules of the intermediate. The term divalent electrophilic moiety is used herein to describe such electrophilic moieties. Examples of electrophilic moieties useful in the invention include CH2 CH CH2 CH3 iC3H7 nC4H9 CH20 CH CH3 2 CH20 CH2 20CH3 CH2OCH3 CH2CH20H CH2 30H CH2CH CH3 OH CH3 20H CH OH CH CH3 2 C CH3 2OH CH OH CH CH3 2 C CH2 OH C6H5 C CH2OH 2OH CH C6H5 OH C CH3 C6H5 OH C CH3 OH CH2OCH3 C CH2OCH3 2OH CH2N CH3 2 SCH3 Si CH3 3 Si CH3 2 T C4H9 CH2Si CH3 3 C CH OH CH2OSi CH3 2 T C4H9 CH2OH CH CH3 OH CH C2H5 OH CH OH CH CH3 2 CH2OCH2CH CH5 2 EMI11.1 In practicing the process of the invention, a temperature equal to or below about O C is required to prevent side reactions from occuring which do not yield the desired product.At a temperature greater than about OOC, the blocking group will tend to migrate from the 0 or N atom to which it must be attached as well as becoming detached later. The blocking group will form a C C or C Si bond depending on the particular blocking group used and the specific reaction conditions. A strong base is required to permit the electrophilic moiety to add to the 4 position. The strong base removes the equivalent of H from the 4 position, thereby permitting addition of the electrophilic moiety. Only strong bases having a pKa greater than about 20 remove the lI atom attached to the 4 position. Strong bases having a pKa greater than about 20 useful in the practice of the invention include lithium or potassium diisopropylamide, n butyllithium and the like. The reaction mixture is stirred to completion, for a period of time generally less than 24 hours, and preferably from about 15 minutes to about 4 hours. After completion of the reaction, the blocking group is removed. Blocking groups may be removed by hydrolysis, using reagents such as tetra n butylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, trifluoroacetic acid in aqueous tetrahydrofuran, or dilute hydrochloric acid. The removal of trialkylsilyl blocking groups by hydrolysis is described for example by R.F. Stewart and L.L. Miller in J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 102, p. 4999 1980 . Hydrolysis is preferably used to remove blocking groups derived from t butyldimethylsilyl chloride and N,N disubstituted carbamoyl chloride. Alternatively, the blocking group can be removed by hydrogenolysis. Hydrogenolysis comprises removal of the blocking group using hydrogen gas.Preferably, hydrogenolysis is carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as commercially available palladium on carbon catalyst. A detailed description of hydrogenolysis, useful herein to remove blocking groups, is described in Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure by J. March, 2ndEd., 1977, McGraw Hill Book Co. Hydrogenolysis is preferably used to remove blocking groups derived from potassium benzyloxide and benzyl bromide. With the removal of the blocking groups, the 4 substituted 3 pyrazolidinones prepared by the process of the invention have the following formula EMI13.1 R1, R2, R3, R4 R5 and E being defined as above.

The mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered.The solids were washed with 100 ml anhydrous ether, the combined filtrate was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was triturated with 100 ml anhydrous ether and filtered to remove salts. The filtrate was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and freed of solvent under vacuum to yield 6.8 g 98 of 4 trimethylsilyl 1 phenyl 3 t butyldimethyl siloxy 2 pyrazoline. Analysis was confirmed by NMR spectra. A stirred solution at OOC under nitrogen of diisopropylamine 1.21 g, 0.012 mole in 40 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was treated with n butyl lithium 7.5 ml of a 1.6 M solution in hexane . The mixture was allowed to stir at OOC for 15 minutes and was then cooled to 780C. To this mixture a solution of 4 trimethylsilyl 1 phenyl 3 t butyldimethyl siloxy 2 pyrazoline 3.5 g, 0.010 moles in 60 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise over a five minute period.The resulting amber solution was stirred for 25 minutes at 780C, then treated with excess anhydrous acetone in one portion, and stirred an additional 20 minutes at 78 C. After warming to room temperature, 20 ml saturated aqueous ammonium chloride was added, and the mixture was diluted with 100 ml each of ether and ethyl acetate. After the aqueous layer was separated and extracted with 100 ml ethyl acetate, the combined organic phases were washed with 20 ml ice cold 10 aqueous hydrochloric acid.

Preparation of 4 3 hydroxypropyl l p tolyl 3pyrazolidinone By the Process of the Present Invention To a stirred solution under nitrogen of l g tolyl 3 pyrazolidinone 52.8 g, 0.30 mole in 500 ml toluene and 50 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added sequentially t butyldimethylsilyl chloride 49.5 g, 0.30 mole , triethylamine 33.0 g, 0.30 mole , 4 N,N dimethylamino pyridine 1.0 g and l,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene 0.1 g . The mixture was refluxed for 3 hours, then cooled to 300C, and filtered. After the solids were washed with ether, the solvents of the combined filtrate were removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was dissolved in 500 ml anhydrous ether and filtered to remove salts.Removal of the solvent of the filtrate yielded 85.6 g 98 yield of l E tolyl 3 t butyldimethylsiloxy 2 pyrazoline. To a stirred room temperature solution under nitrogen of t butyldimethylsilyl chloride 49.7 g, 0.30 mole and imidazole 51.0 g, 0.75 mole in 100 mlN,N dimethylformamide was added in one portion 3 bromopropanol 41.7 g, 0.30 mole . The slightly exothermic reaction mixture was stirred for 3 hours, diluted with ice water, and extracted three times with 200 ml portions of ether. The combined ether extracts were washed five times with 100 ml portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of solvent, the residue was distilled under reduced pressure to yield 43.0 g of a clear oil, 3 bromo 1 t butyldimethylsiloxy propane. A solution of l E tolyl 3 t butyldimethylsiloxy 2 pyrazoline 11.6 g, 0.040 mole , prepared as in two paragraphs above, in 80 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise over a 10 minute period to a stirred solution at 7800 of lithium diisopropylamide in 50 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen. The lithium diisopropylamide was generated at OOC by mixing diisopropylamine 5.1 g and 20.8 ml of a 2.4 M solution of n butyllithium in n hexane. The resulting orange red solution was allowed to stir for 30 minutes at 780C, and was then treated with a single portion of 3 bromo l t butyldimethylsiloxy propane 10 g, 0.040 mole dissolved in 40 ml anhydrous tetrahydrofuran.After being allowed to warm to room temperature overnight, the mixture was diluted with 150 ml ether and 100 ml 10 aqueous hydrochloric acid and shaken vigorously. The separated aqueous layer was extracted with a 1 1 mixture of ether and ethyl acetate. The combined extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of solvent the residue was chromatographed on a silica column and eluted with 70 30 hexane ethyl acetate. A first fraction of 5.0 g representing 4 monoalkylated product , and third fraction of 2.8 g of product 4 3 hydroxypropyl l E tolyl 3 pyraz olidinone were obtained. A second fraction of 1.0 g of 4,4 dialkylated material was discarded. A total yield of 66 could be considered after hydrolysis of the first fraction. The first fraction 1.5 g was dissolved in 100 ml tetrahydrofuran, stirred under nitrogen at room temperature, and heated sequentially with 10 ml water and 0.5 ml trifluoroacetic acid. After two hours stirring the mixture was diluted with 200 ml ether, washed sequentially with water, ice cold saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of solvent, the oily residue was chromatographed on a silica column and eluted with 80 20 2 methylene chloride, ether, ethanol. After recrystallization from 1 1 toluene and ether, 0.9 g of product 4 3 hydroxypropyl 1 E tolyl 3 pyrazolidinone was obtained. Analysis was confirmed by NMR spectra. This example illustrates that a significantly higher yield is obtained 66 using the process of the invention as compared to the prior art process 3 .
