## Description
It is known to produce nucleotides or polynucleotides which are radioactively labeled, such as with isotopes or hydrogen ³H , phosphorus ³²P , carbon ¹⁴C or iodine ¹²⁵I . Such radioactively labeled compounds are useful to detect, monitor, localize and isolate nucleic acids and other molecules of scientific or clinical interest. Unfortunately, however, the use of radioactively labeled materials presents hazards due to radiation. Also due to the relatively short half life of the radioactive materials employed to label such compounds or materials, the resulting labeled compounds or materials have a corresponding relatively short shelf life. It has been proposed to chemically label compounds of interest, such as nucleotides and polynucleotides, so as to overcome or avoid the hazards and difficulties associated with such compounds or materials when radioactively labeled. In the article by P.R. Langer, A. A. Waldrop and D. C. Ward entitled Enzymatic Synthesis of Biotin Labeled Polynucleotides Novel Nucleic Acid Affinity Probes , in The subject matter of said article is comprised in EP A2 0063879 in which additionally it is disclosed that compounds having the structure wherein B represents a purine, deazapurine, or pyrimidine moiety covalently bonded to the C either directly, or when incorporated into oligo and polynucleotides, provide probes which are widely usely. Applications disclosed in EP A2 0 063 879 include detection and localization of polynucleotide sequences in chromosomes, fixed cells, tissue sections and cell extracts. Specific applications include chromosomal karyotyping, clinical diagnosis of nucleic acid containing etiological agents, e.g. bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and diagnosis of genetic disorders. By way of additional background with respect to the utilization of the biotin polynucleotides of the above identified Langer et al article in Other techniques employing biotin labeled reagents with avidin or enzyme labeled avidin reagents are known for the detection and determination of ligands in a liquid medium, see U.S. Patent 4,228,237. Also, it is known to effect gene enrichment based on avidin biotin interaction, particularly as applied to Of further interest in connection with the practices of this invention are the publications appearing in the Other techniques useful in the practices of this invention include nick translation of DNA employing DNA polymerase. A technique for effecting nick translation is disclosed in the article by P. W. Rigby, M. Dieckmann, C. Rhodes and P. Berg entitled Labeling Deoxyribonucleic Acid to High Specific Activity The present invention relates to nucleotides which are modified, such as at the 5 position of pyrimidine or the 7 position of purine, preparatory for the preparation therefrom of nucleotide probes suitable for attachment to or incorporation into DNA or other nucleic acid material. In the practices of this invention nucleotides, i.e. nucleic acids, preferably are modified in a non disruptive manner such that the resulting modified nucleotides are capable of incorporation into nucleic acids and once incorporated in nucleic acids the modified nucleotides do not significantly interfere with the formation or stabilization of the double helix formed of the resulting nucleic acids containing the modified nucleotides. The non disruptive modification of nucleotides and nucleic acids incorporating such modified nucleotides is in contrast with those modifications of nucleotides which are characterized as a disruptive modification in the sense that the resulting disruptively modified nucleotides and nucleic acids containing the same block proper double helix formation. In the practices of this invention, the nucleotides are desirably modified at the 5 position of the pyrimidine or the 7 position of the purine. The nucleotides so modified are non disruptively modified and nucleic acids containing such nucleotides are capable of forming a double helix arrangement. Various methods are useful for the tagging or labeling of DNA in a non disruptive manner. A technique for tagging DNA in a non disruptive manner involves the addition of glucose to 5 hydroxymethylcytosine 5 HMC in DNA using T4 phage glycoslyating enzymes followed by screening by means of a lectin based assay. The present invention is directed to a nucleotide having the general formula P S B, wherein P is the phosphoric acid moiety, S the sugar or monosaccharide moiety and B is the base moiety, said nucleotide having covalently attached to the B moiety a chemical moiety Sig, wherein said Sig moiety comprises 1 a saccharide component, or 2 a saccharide component and a protein component capable of binding to a moiety comprising a saccharide component, or 3 a saccharide component and a protein component and a glycosylated enzyme component capable of binding to said protein component. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are explained in detail in the following enumeration. Further illustrative of the practices of this invention directed to nonradioactive methods or techniques of assaying for specific nucleic acids, the following example deals with the use of the sugar lectin system. This example deals with the use of DNA which is not glycosylated in nature but rather has had a maltotriose group added thereto by way of nick translation described herein. The maltotriose modified dUTP and DNA modified therewith bind specifically to a column of concanvalin A covalently bound to sepharose. By this technique and in accordance with the practices of this invention, there is provided a means for specifically labeling any nucleic acid with sugars. As previously indicated herein, nick translation is only one of a number of techniques and approaches possible for the production of the modified nucleic acids in accordance with this invention. Original examples I XXII, XXXII, XXXIII, XXXV, XXXVII and XXXVIII are abandoned. Lambda DNA was nick translated as described herein with maltotriose coupled to 5 3 amino 1 propenyl 2 deoxyuridine 5 triphosphate and ³H 2 deoxyadenosine 5 triphosphate. Under these conditions DNA was substituted to 40 per cent of its thymidine residues with the maltotriose nucleotide and had a specific activity of 8x10⁵ counts per minute cpm per microgram of DNA. A control sample of DNA substituted only with ³H dATP had a specific activity of 6x10⁵ cpm per microgram DNA. The nick translated DNA samples were purified free of reaction mixture components by Biogel P 60 chromatography as described herein. The purified samples were applied to Con A Sepharose columns as described in Figures 2A and 2B. The maltotriose labeled DNA was retained on the column when washed with PBS but was removed by subsequent elution with 10mM Tris HCl, pH 8.2 Figure 4A . The unsubstituted tritiated DNA did not bind to the column at pH 7.4 Figure 4B . Potentially immunogenic haptenes may be introduced at the 5 position of uridine by a variety of methods in the literature. 5 perfluorobutyl 2 deoxyuridine was synthesized using a method of Cech et al, Tubericydin was substituted at the 5 position by derivitizing the 5 cyano compound, toyocamycin. An example is the synthesis of 4 amino 5 tetrazol 5 yl 7 B 5 Cyano 2 deoxyuridine was prepared according to Bleckley et al, 4 amino 5 amino methylene 7 β D 2 deoxyfuranosyl pyrrolo 2,3 d pyrimidine dihydrochloride was obtained as follows. 4 amino 5 cyano 7 β D 2 deoxyfuranosyl pyrrolo 2,3 d pyrimidine Toyocamycin 0.2 g was dissolved in hydrochloric acid 10 ml . 10 palladium on charcoal 0.1 g was added as the mixture hydrogenated at 40 psi for 5 hours at room temperature. After filtration the water was evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue was triturated with ethanol, and the product recrystallized from 50 ethanol. 5 amino 2 deoxyuridine was prepared from 5 bromo 2 deoxyuridine according to the procedure of Roberts and Visser, 5 methylamino 2 deoxyuridine 0.2 g was prepared as follows. 5 cyano 2 deoxyuridine 0.2 g, 0.05 mol was dissolved in 1 N hydrochloric acid 10 ml . 10 palladium on charcoal 0.1 g was added, and the mixture hydrogenated at 40 p.s.i. for 10 hours at room temperature. The mixture was filtered and the water evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue was triturated with ether, and the product was recrystallized from 80 ethanol. Maltose triose was oxidized to the corresponding carboxylic acid by the following method. Maltose triose 0.5 g, 0.94 mmol was dissolved in water 5 ml . Lead carbonate 0.42 g, 1.1 mmol and bromine 0.17 ml , 3.3 mmol were added, and the mixture was allowed to react at room temperature for six days after which no reducing sugar remained. The mixture was filtered, and silver carbonate 0.2 g added. After refiltering, the filtrate was deionized by elution through Dowex 50 H form . Evaporation of water and drying in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide yielded the desired product. Maltose triose was coupled to 5 3 amino 1 propenyl 2 deoxyuridine 5 triphosphate by the following procedure. Oxidized maltose triose 190 mg, 0,18 mmol was dissolved in dimethylformamide 0.8 ml and cooled to 4 A DNA probe was ligated to a synthetic DNA composed of repeated sequences of Calf intestine alkaline phosphate was biotinylated as follows The enzyme 1 mg, 7.7 mmol was chromatographed on a G 50 column eluting with 0.1 M Hepes buffer pH 8.0 containing 0.1 M sodium chloride. The pooled fractions were reacted with N biotinyl 6 amino caproic acid N hydroxysuccinimide ester 0.675 mg, 0.77 µmol dissolved in 10 ml diemthylformamide at room temperature for 1 hour. Sodium periodate 0.1 M 125 µl was added and stirring continued for 2 hours. The mixture as dialyzed at 4 Horse radish peroxidase 20 mg dissolved in 5 ml distilled water was added to 1.0 ml freshly prepared 0.1 M sodium periodate solution. After stirring at room temperature for 20 minutes it was dialyzed overnight at 4 Carrot acid phosphatase has been mentioned by Brunngraber and Chargaff, Streptavidin has been purified and shown to be a 60,000 dalton polypeptide. Like avidin, streptavidin contains four subunits and binds tightly four molecules of biotin. Unlike avidin, however, it is non glycosylated and it has PI of 5.0 as compared to avidin with PI 10.5. Due to the difference in pI streptavidin does not have a tendency to non specifically interact with DNA. A semi synthetic medium containing salt, 1 glucose, 0.1 asparagine, 0.05 yeast extract and trace elements was prepared. The cultures were grown at 26 The precipitate was dissolved in water and dialyzed against 1.0 M NaCl, 50 mM Na₂CO₃. In the next step affinity column chromatography on iminobiotin sepharose was used. Eluted streptavidin from iminobiotin sepharose column was shown to be chromatographically pure by non denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. The final purification of streptavidin is accomplished by affinity purification through an iminobiotin sepharose column. Iminobiotin is an analog of biotin in which the carbonyl of the urea moiety is substituted with an imine function. Iminobiotin will bind avidin and streptavidin at basic pH but the complex is dissociable at acidic pH. Iminobiotin is prepared from biotin in several steps. Biotin is hydrolyzed by barium hydroxide to cis 3,4 diamino 2 tetrahydrothiophene valeric acid which is reacted with cyanogen bromide to iminobiotin. The iminobiotin is coupled to amino sepharose via the N hydroxysuccinimide ester of its hydrobromide salt. The crude protein mixture from DEAE eluted In the practices of this invention avidin is useful as a detecting mechanism for labeled DNA, such as biotin labeled DNA. However, avidin itself, such at about neutral pH, complexes with DNA with the result that any signal derivable from a complex between biotin labeled DNA and avidin might be lost or be non detectable in the background due to the complex formation between avidin and unlabeled DNA. This disadvantage of the use of avidin in the practices of this invention is not possessed by streptavidin which does not form a complex with DNA at about neutral pH but is capable of forming a complex with the biotin portion of biotin labeled DNA. The use of the antigen antibody system for detecting either antigen or antibody is well known. A comparable system is a system baked on a glycosylated substrate or molecule and matching or appropriate lectin. In this system the lectin would carry a label, such as an appropriate enzyme. In this glycosyl lectin system the labeled lectin forms a complex with the glycosyl moiety, comparable to the antigen antibody complex, and this complex comprising the glycosylated molecule and appropriate labeled lectin having the necessary glycosyl or sugar moiety specificity would then present itself eliciting the expected response from the label portion of the labeled lectin making up the glycosyl lectin complex. Another aspect of the practices of this invention which is particularly advantageous is to carry out the detection or hybridization in the liquid phase between the DNA sought to be detected and the DNA detecting probe. In this liquid phase system both the DNA molecule to be detected and the appropriate DNA detecting probe are not attached to any insoluble substrate or any insoluble chemical moiety. The advantages of the liquid phase detection system reside in the speed of hybridization or hybrid formation between the DNA to be detected and the appropriate DNA probe therefor. For example, in a solid liquid system the time required to effect recognition and hybridization formation is about ten times greater than if it were carried out in a completely liquid system, i.e. both DNA to be detected and the detecting DNA are not attached to an insoluble moiety. The probes prepared in accordance with the practices of this invention are adaptable for use in the detection of viruses and bacteria in fluids as indicated hereinabove. Where the fluids to be examined do not contain large amounts of protein, the viruses therein can be concentrated by absorption on hydroxyapatite and eluted in a small amount of phosphate buffer. When the fluid to be examined contains large amounts of protein, the viruses can be concentrated by high speed centrifugation. If antibody were available, absorption on an affinity column and elution with acid would be preferable because it would be possible to process many probes in accordance with the practices of this invention at the same time. The bacteria to be examined is usually readily concentrated by centrifugation. In accordance with the practices of this invention, the identification or characerization of the isolated particles, viruses and bacteria, would be hybridization of the characterizing or identifying DNA thereof with a specific single stranded DNA probe prepared in accordance with the practices of this invention. After hybridization, excess non hybridized probe DNA would be digested with S₁ nuclease and exonuclease I from The special nucleotides of this invention include a phosphoric acid P moiety, a sugar or monosaccharide S moiety, a base B moiety, a purine or a pyrimidine and a signalling chemical moiety Sig covalently attached to the B moiety. Following are structural formulas of various base B moieties and nucleotides which are modified in accordance with the practices of this invention. The special nucleotides in accordance with this invention, as indicated hereinabove, in addition to the P, S and B moieties, include a chemical moiety Sig coavalently attached to the B moieties. Of special interest in accordance with the practices of this invention would be those nucleotides having the general formula, It is pointed out that the special nucleotides in accordance with the practices of this invention described or defined hereinabove by the general formula P S B Sig, also include nucleotides wherein the Sig chemical moiety is covalently attached to the B moiety at the N⁶ or 6 amino group position when the B moiety is adenine or the N² or 2 amino group position when the B moiety is guanine or the N⁴ or 4 amino group position when the B moiety is cytosine. The resulting nucleotides containing the Sig moiety attached thereto are capable of signalling themselves or making themselves self detecting or their presence known and being detectable is a double stranded DNA, RNA or DNA RNA hybrid. By way of summary, as indicated hereinabove with respect to the make up of the various special nucleotides in accordance with this invention, the special nucleotides can be described as comprising a phosphoric acid moiety P, a sugar moiety S and a base moiety B, a purine or pyrimidine, which combination of P S B is well known with respect to and defines nucleotides, both deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The nucleotides are then modified in accordance with the practices of this invention by having covalently attached thereto, to the B moiety, a chemical moiety Sig. The chemical moiety Sig so attached to the nucleotide P S B is capable of rendering or making the resulting nucleotide, now comprising P S B with the Sig moiety being attached to one or more of the other moieties, self detecting or signalling itself or capable of making its presence known per se, when incorporated into a polynucleotide, especially a double stranded polynucleotide, such as a double stranded DNA, a double stranded RNA or a double stranded DNA RNA hybrid. The Sig moiety desirably should not interfere with the capability of the nucleotide to form a double stranded polynucleotide containing the special Sig containing nucleotide in accordance with this invention and, when so incorporated therein, the Sig containing nucleotide is capable of detection, localization or observation. The Sig moiety employed in the make up of the special nucleotides of this invention could comprise an enzyme or enzymic material, such as alkaline phosphatase, glucose oxidase, horseradish peroxidase, acid phosphatase or β galactosidase. The Sig moiety could also include a radioactive isotope component, such as radioactive cobalt, making the resulting nucleotide observable by radiation detecting means. Most usefully, the Sig moiety is a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide or monosaccharide, which is capable of complexing with or being attached to a sugar or polysaccharide binding protein, such as a lectin, e.g. Concanavalin A. As indicated in accordance with the practices of this invention, the Sig component could comprise any of the above chemical moieties which is attachable either directly or through a chemical linkage or linker arm to the base B component of the nucleotide. The Sig component of the nucleotides in accordance with this invention and the nucleotides and polynucleotides incorporating the nucleotides of this invention containing the Sig component are equivalent to and useful for the same purposes as the nucleotides described in EP A2 0 063 879. A particularly important and useful aspect of the special nucleotides of this invention is the use of such nucleotides in the preparation of DNA or RNA probes. Such probes would contain a nucleotide sequence substantially matching the DNA or RNA sequence of genetic material to be located and or identified. The probe would contain one or more of the special nucleotides of this invention. A probe having a desired nucleotide sequence, such as a single stranded polynucleotide, either DNA or RNA probe, would then be brought into contact with DNA or RNA genetic material to be identified. Upon the localization of the probe and the formation of a double stranded polynucleotide containing the probe and the matching DNA or RNA material to be identified, the resulting formed double stranded DNA or RNA containing material would then be observable and identified. A probe in accordance with this invention may contain substantially any number of nucleotide units, from about 5 nucleotides up to about 500 or more, as may be required. It would appear that 12 matching, preferably consecutive, nucleotide units would be sufficient to effect an identification of most of the DNA or RNA material to be investigated or identified, if the 12 nucleotide sequence of the probe matches a corresponding cooperative sequence in the DNA or RNA material being investigated or to be identified. As indicated, such probes may contain one or more of the special Sig containing nucleotides in accordance with this invention, preferably at least about one special nucleotide per 5 10 of the nucleotides in the probe. As indicated hereinabove, various techniques may be employed in the practices of this invention for the incorporation of the special nucleotides of this invention into DNA and related structures. The technique of employing terminal transferase for the addition of the special nucleotides in accordance with this invention is widely applicable and the resulting modified nucleotides containing the special nucleotides in accordance with this invention including the special biotinated nucleotides or the special glycosylated nucleotides could be selectively recovered via complexing with avidin upon a Sepharose avidin column or complexing with a lectin, such as Concanavalin A or a Sepharose Concanavalin A column. One further example of small molecule interaction with naturally occurring proteins involves the specific binding of coenzyme or other prosthetic molecules to enzymes. Examples of such coenzymes include thiamin pyrophosphate, flavine mononucleotide, flavine adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, coenzyme A, pyridoxyl phosphate, biotin, tetrahydrofolic acid, coenzyme B₁₂, lipoic and ascorbic acid. Many of these molecules form covalent linkages with their apoenzymes. However, some, for example, coenzyme A, coenzyme B₁₂ and tetrahydrofolic acid, associate in a non covalent but specific manner with their cognate apoenzymes. A specific coenzyme apoenzyme system for use in this system is flavine adenine dinucleotide FAD and flavine adenine dinucleotide reductase isolated from The special nucleotides of this invention and polynucleotides including such nucleotides, either single stranded or double stranded polynucleotides, DNA and or RNA, comprising the components, phosphoric acid moiety P, the sugar or monosaccharide moiety S, the base moiety B, a purine or a pyrimidine, and the signalling or self detecting moiety, Sig, covalently attached to the B moieties, as indicated hereinabove, have many uses and utilities. For example, the nucleotides of this invention and polynucleotides containing the nucleotides of this invention are useful as immune stimulating agents, as adjuvants in vaccines, as agents for the stimulation or induction from competent cells, such as lymphocytes, for the production of lmphokines, cytokines or cytokinins, interferon or other cellular products. It is well known that double stranded poly A U is a stimulator or inducer for the production of interferon, although weakly so. Similarly, poly I C is also known as a stimulator or inducing agent for the production of interferon. The advantage of polynucleotides, such as double stranded polynucleotides incorporating one or more nucleotides in accordance with this invention is that, in effect, such polynucleotides would be more effective and more powerful inducing or stimulating agents for the production of interferon and related materials from cells. For example, nucleotides in accordance with this invention containing the above described components P, S, B and Sig, are suitably prepared so that the nucleotides and polynucleotides prepared therefrom are more resistant to nucleases. Similarly, such nucleotides and polynucleotides containing the same and suitably prepared which are more capable of contacting, stimulating and penetrating cellular surfaces or membranes, such as the cellular surfaces or membranes of lymphocytes and other cells so as to stimulate the same for the production of a desired cellular product, such as interferon. Particularly useful among those special nucleotides in accordance with this invention having the formula P S B Sig and especially useful are those wherein the Sig component is at the 5 position of the pyrimidine or the 7 position of the purine or a deazapurine or the N² position of guanine or the N⁶ position of adenine. Such nucleotides and polynucleotides incorporating the same, both single stranded and double stranded nucleotides, DNA and or RNA are prepared in accordance with this invention to provide increased stability with respect to the double stranded helix of DNA or RNA or DNA RNA hybrid containing the same. Increased resistance to nucleases is also achievable as well as alterations or favorable changes in the hydrophobic properties or electrical or charge properties of the nucleotides and polynucleotides containing the same. Also, nucleotides and polynucleotides in accordance with this invention are prepared which, when administered to humans, have reduced pyrogenicity or exhibit less other whole body toxic responses. Additionally, the nucleotides and polynucleotides are prepared in accordance with this invention to provide a ligand, such as the component Sig, to which specific polypeptides can combine to create or bring about the formation of RNA complexes. It is seen therefore that the nucleotides of this invention include the P, S, B and Sig components wherein the Sig is covalently attached to the B moieties open up or provide a whole array of chemical agents having special biological effects including therapeutic effects and cytotoxic effects. The special nucleotides of this invention, including polynucleotides containing these nucleotides, in addition to being stimulating or inducing agents for the production of cellular materials or products, such as interferons, lymphokines and or cytokines, are also useful for their chemotherapeutic effect and for the preparation of chemotherapeutic agents based thereon but also for their cytotoxic effects and the production of cytotoxic agents based thereon. The moiety Sig attached to the special nucleotides of this invention containing the other moieties or components P, S, B provides a site per se for the attachment thereto, the Sig component, of special agents of known chemotherapeutic or cytotoxic effect. Such nucleotides could be introduced or administered to the subject being treated, e.g. human body or animal, so as to be incorporated into the DNA and or RNA components of the body or cell so as to either interfere with the synthesis of the body or cellular DNA and or RNA or to attack tumors or to, in effect, kill or otherwise interfere with the growth of undesired cells. The administration of the nucleotides and or polynucleotides containing the nucleotides to the body, human body or animal, can be effected by a number of suitable means. Particularly effective would be the intravenous introduction to the body of preparations containing the nucleotides of this invention and a suitable physiologically acceptable carrier or the nucleotides could be administered subcutaneously, transdermally, or intramuscularly or by direct introduction into the site where the chemotherapeutic or cytotoxic effect of the nucleotides is sought or desired to be effective. Not only could desired chemotherapeutic or cytotoxic effects be achieved systemically or locally but also, as indicated hereinabove, the special P, S, B and Sig containing nucleotides of this invention, including polynucleotides containing such nucleotides, are useful as immune stimulating agents and adjuvants therefor. Accordingly, vaccines containing the special nucleotides and polynucleotides in accordance with this invention can be prepared having improved effectiveness and versatility. Of special interest in the practices of this invention improved polynucleotides incorporating the special nucleotides of this invention are provided as inducers or stimulating agents for the production of interferon. Such polynucletoides would be single stranded or double stranded ribonucleotides, dsRNA, having the structures, where A and B are complementary base pairs, such as a purine, a 7 deazapurine or pyrimidine modified by the addition of an organic moiety Sig in accordance with the disclosures of this invention on the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring or the 7 position of the purine ring or the N² of guanine, or the N⁶ of adenine or the N⁴ of cytosine as described herein. The modifications of the polynucleotides at these positions lead to relatively undisruptive or non disruptive double stranded nucleic acid molecules as measured by rates of association and melting points. In the special polynucleotides of this invention employed as inducers of interferon and other cellular or humoral factors or components, such as lymphokines or cytokines, the following groups would be attached thereto as indicated by the formulas, In the utilization of the special polynucleotides of this invention, such as the special dsRNA of this invention in the induction process for the production of interferon it has been demonstrated that DEAE dextran facilitates this operation. It appears that since DEAE dextran complexes with dsRNA and protects it from nuclease degradation, thereby enhancing interferon induction. It has also been noted that poly rC rI is taken into cells more efficiently when complexed with DEAE dextran. Accordingly, in the practices of this invention the hydrophobic properties and the ionic or electron charge properties of the special dsRNA of this invention are important factors and capable of manipulation in the applicability of these materials to induce interferon production. It has been observed that such conditions or factors which promote the induction of interferon also lead to and promote the induction of other cellular or humoral components, such as lymphokines and cytokines. It is apparent, therefore, that the special nucleotides and polynucleotides containing the special nucleotides of this invention act as immune modulators and stimulators of the immune response other than simply being effective as inducers of interferon production. Superior agents for the above in accordance with the practices of this invention would include nucleotides wherein the Sig moiety incorporates biotin or streptavidin or avidin. Poly rI poly rC complexed poly L lysine exhibits adjuvant properties and such properties are enhanced and improved in accordance with the practices of this invention when the poly rI and poly rC components are modified to include one or more of the special nucleotides in accordance with this invention. In the description of the special nucleotides and modified DNA employed or developed in the practices of this invention, mention has been made of mono, oligo and polysaccharides. It is pointed out that derivatives of mono, oligo and polysaccharides are also useful in the preparation of the special nucleotides of this invention. For example, it is possible to modify individual sugar moieities employed in the make up of the special nucleotides and employ the resulting modified sugar moieties to effect or carry out additional chemical reactions. Such modified mono, oligo and polysaccharide moieties, when employed as the Sig moiety in the preparation of the special nucleotides of this invention, provide an added versatility with respect to the detection of the nucleotides or other compounds containing such modified saccharides either as the sugar S or as the Sig moiety thereof.
