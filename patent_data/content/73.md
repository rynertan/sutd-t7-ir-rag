## Description
24 DEHYDROVITAMIN D DERIVATIVES AND PREPARATION THEREOF AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SAME BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Known vitamin D compounds, such as cholecalciferol derivatives and metabolites thereof, promote both intestinal calcium and phosphate transport and in conjunction with parathormone promote bone calcium mobilization bone resorbtion . It is an object of the invention to find a class of novel vitamin D3 derivatives which promote intestinal calcium transport without the usual magnitude of bone calcium mobilization, i.e., selectively promote intestinal transport, as opposed to bone mobilization. This differential effect has been widely sought for treatment of osteoporosis, especially that induced by an insufficient amount of calcium in relationship to the amount of phosphate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In its composition aspect, the instant invention nay be described as residing in the concept of a new and useful group of vitamin D3 derivatives classifiable i n the field of organic chemistry as 24 dehydrovitamin D3 derivatives.The novel 24 dehydrovitamin D3 derviatives of the instant invention are members selected from the group consisting of 24 dehydrovitamin D3, 24 dehydro ln hydroxy vitamin D3, 24 deydro 3B desoxy l hydroxy vitamin D3 and 24 dehydro 3B desoxy 3a fluoro vitamin.D3. These novel compounds may be represented by the following structural formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and hydroxy R2 is a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy and fluoro and wherein R1 is not hydroxy when R2 is fluoro. The instant invention is based upon applicants discovery that vitamin D3 and derivatives may be metabolically blocked by the presence of a double bond at position C24tC25. The presence of such double bond retards metabolic hydroxylation in vivo in the 25 position. These novel 24dehydrovitamin D3 derivatives promote intèstsnal calcium transport as opposed to bone calcium mobilization.It is contemplated, therefore, that pharmaceutically acceptable dosage units containing a therapeutically effective quantity of the novel 24 dehydrovitamin D3 derivatives of this invention will be administered orally or parenterally to patients, including humans and warm blooded animals, in need of vitamin D3 therapy to promote intestinal calcium transport. and in the treatment of rickets, osteomalacia, and osteoporosis including steroid induced osteoporosis, senile osteoporosis and post menopausal osteoporosis. 24 dehydrovitamin D3 may be prepared readily by the photolysis of cholesta 5,.7,24 trien 3S ol J. P. Moreau, D. J. Aberhart and E. Carpi, J. Org.Chem., Vol. 39, No. 14, pp. 2018, 1974 in order to obtain 24 dehydroprevitamin D3. The irradiation conveniently is carried out at low temperatures, about 0 to 50C, in a suitable organic solvent, such as deoxygenated ether, using a 450 watt Hanovia medium pressure mercury vapor lamp. Photolysis under these conditions usually is carried out for as short as 2 minutes or up to about 1 hour but usually is in the range of 4 to .10 minutes while the reaction mixture is under a blanket of nitrogen. The photolysate usually will contain a mixture of vitamin and previtamin together with some starting material and or other isomeric forms.The desired previtamin, however, usually is the predominating product and can be separated and purified by low temperature preparative thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates 1000 or 2000 at about 50C developed with a suitable organic solvent or solvent mixture such as, for example, 10 to 15 acetone in hexane. Desirably the purification is carried out in the dark. The purified 24 dehydroprevitamin D3 then is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as deoxygenated ethanol and heated at relux for 1 to 2 hours. The desired 24 dehydrovitamin D3 is separated and purified by low temperature preparative thin layer chromatography as described above. If desired, the tarting cholesta 5,7,24 trien 3A ol may be prepared from the known cholesta 5,7, dien 3b,25 diol 3 acetate by first treating this diene in a suitable organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ethyl acetate and the like with 4 phenyl 1,2,4triazoline 3,5 dione in order to prepare the 4 phenyl l,2,4 triazoline 3,5 dione adduct and to protect the cholesta5,7 diene system during subsequent dehydration.The cholesta 5,7 dien 3B 25 diol 3 acetate adduct in a suitable organic solvent such as benzene, hexane, xylene and the like, then is treated at about 250 to 400C with a dehydrating agent such as phosphorous pentoxide in order to obtain the 4 phenyl l, 2,4 triazoline 3, 5 dione adduct of cholesta 5, 7 ,24 trien 3b ol 3 acetate applicants have found that the 5,7,24 triene only is formed by this dehydration techniciue without formation of the corresponding 5,7,25triene isomer which then is treated with lithium aluminum hydride in dry tetrahydrofuran or other suitable solvent such as lower alkyl ether to remove the triazoline dione group and obtain the desired cholesta 5,7,24 trien S ol. This reaction, conveniently is carried out at the reflux temperature of the solvent under an inert atmosphere nitrogen or the like and usually requires about 1 to 2 hours for completion. 24 dehydro 1a hydroxyvitamin D3 may be prepared from the known cholesta 5, 7 dien , 3b, 25 triol 13 diacetate by treating this compound with a dehydrating agent such as methyl carboxysulfamoyl triethylammonium hydroxide inner salt in dry benzene or other suitable organic solvent such as toluene or xylene in order to obtain cholesta 5,7,24 trien 1t,Z3 diol 1,3 diacetate together with the corresponding 5,7,25 triene. The reaction conveniently is carried out at the reflux temperature of the solvent under an inert atmosphere and usually requires about 20 to 60 minutes for complete. Removal of the solvent and purification by conventional preparative thin layer chromatography gives the desired 5,7,24 trien 1,3 diacetate which may be irradiated and isomerized to obtain 24 dehydro lL hydroxyprevitamin D3 diace tate and 24 dehydro lo hydroxyiTitamin D3 D3 diacetate, respectively., by the techniques already discussed above.Conventional basic hydroylsis of the 24 dehydro ls hydroxyvitamin D3 diacetate using, for example, an alkali metal hydroxide such as 2.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide gives 24 dehydro lahydroxyvitamin D3 which may be purified by conventional low temperature preparative thin layer chromatography. If desired, the 24 dehydro la hydroxyprevitamin D3 may b e hydrolyzed prior to the irradiation step. 24 dehydro 3ffi desoxy 3B fluoro vitamin D3 may be prepared from the known 25 hydroxycholes terol dibenzoate by first selectively hydrolyzing this compound at the 3 position with an alkali metal hydroxide such as 2.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide to give 25 benzoyloxycholesterol. The reaction conveniently is carried out in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, ethanol or mixtures thereof under an inert atmosphere. Completion of the reaction requires 36 to 60 hours at roomtemperature. Removal of the solvent gives the crude product which is purified by conventional recrystallization. The 25 benzoyloxycholesterol then is treated with a fluorinating agent such as diethylaminosulfur trifluoride in a suitable organic solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform, ethyl acetate and the like at low temperatures ranging from about 80 to 609C under an inert atmosphere.Upon warming to room temperature and standing for about an hour the crude product, 25 benzoyloxy 36 fluorocholesta 5 ene, is separated and purified by chromatography on silica gel eluting with methylene chloride or the like. The 25 benzoyloxy 38 fluorocholest 5 ene then is treated with a brominating agent such as dibromodimethylhydantoin in boiling hexane under nitrogen and refluxes for about 30 minutes to give 25 benzoyloxy 3 fluoro 7 bromocholest 5 ene which is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent such as xylene and added to a refluxing solution of trimethylphosphite in the same solvent also under nitrogen. The mixture is refluxed for about an hour and concentrated to give a crude mixture of 25 benzoyloxy 38 fluorocholest 5 , 7 diene along with the corresFonding 4,6 diene. This diene mixture then may be treated with 4 phenyl 1,2,4 triazoline 3,5 dione as previously described in order to obtain cyclo adducts.Chromatography on silica gel eluting with methylene chloride gives the desired 4 phenyl 1,2,4 triazoline 3, 5 dione adduct of 25 benzoyloxy 3 fluoro cholesta 5,7 diene. The above cholesta 5,7 diene cyclo adduct then is converted to 3d fluorocholesta 5,7 dien 25 oi by treatment with lithium aluminum hydride in a refluxing organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is ref fluxed for 30 to 90 minutes desirably in the dark and under an inert atmosphere. The 38 fluorocholesta 5 , 7 dien 25 ol so produced then is dehydrated with methyl carboxysulfa moyl triethylammonium hydroxide inner salt as previously described to obtain 3 fluorocholesta 5,7,24 triene which is subjected to irradiation and isomerization as described above to obtain, respectively,24 dehydro 38 desoxy 3 beta fluoro vitamin D3 and 24 dehydro 38 desoxy 36 fluoro vitaminD3. 24 dehydro 3l desocy la hydroxyvitamin D3 may be prepared from , 25 dihydroxycholesta 5, 7 diene W.

Revs. Coma., Vol. 65, No. 1, pp 24, 1975 by first selectively acetylating this compound at the l position with an acetylating agent such as acetic anhydride.The reaction conveniently is run in an organic solvent such as pyridine initially at a temperature between 0 and 5 C. After addition of the acetic anhydride is complete the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional 4 to 6 hours. The crude la acetoxy 25hydroxycholest 5,7 diene is separated and purified by conventional chromatography on silica gel eluting with chloroform. This product then may be dehydrated by treatment with methyl carboxysulfamoyl triethyl ammonium hydroxide inner salt by techniques previously described to obtain la acetoxy cholest 5,7,24 triene together with the corresponding 5,7,25 triene.The mixture is separated by conventional preparative thin layer chromatography employing, for example, 10 silver nitrate impregnated silica gel and developing with 10 acetone in hexane to obtain the pure 5,7,24triene. The acetoxy group at the l position then may be removed by conventional basic hydrolysis employing an alkali metal hydroxide such as 2.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide to obtain la hydroxycholesta 5,7,24 triene which then may be irradiated and isomerized by techniques described above to obtain, respectively, 24 dehydro 3s desoxy 1X hydroxy previtamin D3 and 24 dehydro 38 desoxy la hydroxyvitamin D3. As pointed out above, another aspect of the instant invention relates to novel pharmaceutical compositions for promoting intestinal calcium transport and for treating osteoporosis comprising therapeutically effective quantity of the 24dehydrovitamin D3 derivatives described above as the essential active ingredient together with a non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.Such compositions also may be used inthetreat ment of secondary hyperparathyroidis,, especially that induced by an insufficient amount of calcium in relationship to the amount of phosphate.

Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, corn starch, gelatin, talc, sterotix, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, terra alma, sucrose, agar, pectin and acacia. Exemplary of liquid carriers are peanut oil, olive oil, sesame oil and water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone, or with a wax. The treatment of osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism in accordance with the method of the present invention is accomplished by orally or parenterally administering to patients a compound of formula I supra, or mixtures thereof in a nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Several pharmaceutical forms of the therapeutically useful compositions may be used. For example, if a solid carrier is used, the compositions may take the form of tablets, capsules, powders, troches or lozenges, prepared by standard pharmaceutical techniques. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a soft gelatin capsule, a syrup, a liquid solution, a liquid emulsion or a liquid suspension. The active compounds of formula I, supra, are administered in a therapeutically effective amount sufficient to treat osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyrbidis,. The metabolically blocked 24 dehydrovitamin D3 derivatives will reduce the bonemobilizationin those cases wherein clinical symptoms have not been observed, e.g., administered prophylactically to persons subject to steroid induced osteoporosis, and in addition retard bone mobilization in those cases wherein clinical symptoms have been observed, e.g., senile osteoporosis, post menopausal osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Advantageously, the active compounds of formula I, supra, will be administered alone or in a pharmaceutical composition in an amount of from about 1.0 to 3000International Units IU per day, preferably from about 10 to 500 IU day.Standard preparations of vitamin D3 have an activity of about 40 IU g. The daily dosage may be given either in single or multiple dosage. The method of treatment of this invention comprises administering to a patient warm blooded animal or human the compound of formula I, supra, as previously described admixed with a non toxic pharmaceutical carrier such as exemplified above.It should be understood that although preferred dosage ranges are given, the dose level for any particular patient depends upon the activity of the specific compound employed.
