# Multiprocessor system comprising a task handling arrangement.

## Abstract
The task handling arrangement is provided in a multi processor system in which each processor 5 includes a task dispatcher and a signal dispatcher. The signal dispatcher runs in a processor whenever a task dispatching element TDE is put on the task dispatching queue TDQ as a result of the task running in the processor. The signal dispatcher examines the TDEs enqueued on the TDQ and determines if any task dispatcher should be invoked, i.e. if any processor is running a lower priority task a task switch should occur. If so, it signals the selected processor to invoke its task dispatcher. After completing the task switch, the selected processor must invoke its signal dispatcher to determine if the task it had been performing should now be performed on some other processor in the multiprocessor system.
