## Description
A MANUFACTURING METHOD FOR HOUSINGS WITH A TWO LAYER STRUCTURE The present invention relates to the manufacture of housings having a two layer structure intended mainly for use in housing electric articles and electronic instruments. The present invention thus provides a method for the manufacture of housings having a two layer structure which method comprises injection molding a first layer using a thermoplastic resin in which a metal filler is mixed and then injection molding a second layer using a thermoplastic resin in which no electric conductive fillers is mixed, while keeping the temperature of the first layer within 300C of its softening point. One preferred form of metal filler for the first layer is metal fiber having a diameter from 5 to 100 micrometres and a length from 1 mm to 10 mm. Another preferred form of filler for the first layer is metal flake having shortest dimension and longest dimension from 0.5 mm to 3 mm, respectively, and a thickness from 10 to 100 micrometres. Recently, thanks to remarkable developments in electronics including the development of, for example, theIC and LSI digital instruments using an IC or LSI, such as the computer, the electronic game machine, the television game machine, the switching electric power source of the electronic cash register, the digital clock, the desk electric computer and the word processor have become widespread. Said electric articles and electronic instruments advantageously use plastics as materials of their housings because the housings using plastics as the materials are easily mass produced, because plastics have an excellent moldability and processability and have good insulating property. On the other hand, digital instruments generate an electromagnetic wave of more than 10,000 pulse sec to the space and said electromagnetic wave may disturb satisfactory radio, TV and wireless telegraph reception because plastics as materials for housings can transmit the electromagnetic wave and therefore the problem of shielding from the electromagnetic wave has become important to protect against the disturbance of the electromagnetic wave. Hitherto, the use of thermoplastic resins mixed with metal filler has been studied as the material of housings. Nevertheless, said plastics have such disadvantages that the metal filler in the plastics may be exposed at the surface of molded housings, so that the appearance of housings becomes inferior, and such properties as mechanical strength and insulation resistance decrease.Formerly, housings consisting of a first layer made of thermoplastic resin s in which metal filler is mixed and a second layer made of thermoplastic resin s in which no electric conductive filler including metal filler is mixed have been provided by the inventors of the present invention. Said housings have a desirable appearance because of the presence ofthe second layer as an outer layer and a desirable electromagnetic shielding effectiveness because of the presence of the first layer as the inner layer. In said two layers structure, it may be necessary that the two layers are strongly bonded each other to prevent delamination, and further it may be necessary to prevent warpage of the resulting housings. Accordingly, the present invention seeks to provide housings having a two layer structure in which said two layers are strongly bonded to each other to prevent delamination. Another object of the present invention is to prevent warpage of the housings. Further object of the present invention is to provide housings having a two layer structure which possess an excellent electromagnetic shielding effectiveness. Still further object of the present invention is to provide metal filler s which provide s an excellent electromagnetic shielding effectiveness to the housings. Said objects can be attained by a manufacturing method of housings having a two layer structure which comprises injection molding first layer by using thermoplastic resin s in which metal filler s is are mixed and then injection molding second layer by using thermoplastic resin s while keeping temperature of said first layer in the range of the softening point of 300C, and furtherselectingmetal fiber s having a diameter from Slim to 100 ym and a length from 1 mm to 10 mm or metal flake s having shortest dimension and longest dimension from 0.5 mm to 3 mm, respectively, and a thickness from 10 rm to loorm as said metal filler s . BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows a side view of the main part of an embodiment of the injection molding machine used in the present invention Figure 2 shows a vertical sectional view of the main part of the embodiment and Figure 3 shows a sectional view of an embodiment of the housings in the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of housings having a two layer structure which comprises injection molding first layer by using thermoplastic resin s in which metal filler s is are mixed and then injection molding second layer by using thermoplastic resin s while keeping the temperature of said first layer in the range of the softening point of 30 C. Said thermoplastic resin s used as material s of said first layer and second layer may be such as polyvinylchloride, polyamide, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer ABS , polystyrene, polyphenylene oxide, polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate and the like.Said metal filler s is are mixed to the thermoplastic resin resin A in said first layer and no electric conductive fillers including metal filler are mixed to the thermoplastic resin resin B in said second layer. Desirable combinations of the resin A and the resin B for injection molding, compatibility between the resin A and the resin B and the like are shown in Table 1.

Said metal fillers is are provided in the form of powder, flake, fiber and the like. Further, metal coated fiber s such as aluminum coated glass fiber, silver coated glass fiber and the like is are also used as the filler s . Desirable forms of the filler for the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness may be fiber or flake since the filler having a form of fiber or flake is easy to contact each other and to form contineous structure of an electric conductor in the first layer and so that excellent conductivity, namely an excellent electromagnetic shielding effectiveness, of the first layer may be obtained in a small content of said filler s . The desirable size of the fiber may be from 5 flm to 100 cm in a diameter and from 1 mm to 10 mm in a length.If the fiber has a diameter less than 5 m and a length more than 10 mm, the fiber will be apt to be knotted and tangled to disturb smooth mixing with the resin A and further reduce moldability of mixture of the resin A and metal filler s . On the other hand, if the fiber has a diameter more than 100 tom and a length less than 1 mm, closeness of the contact of the fiber to each other may be reduced, and accordingly an electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of the first layer may be reduced. Said metal fiber may be manufactured by grinding method with micro vibrating blade, melting and rapid cooling method, pultrusion method and the like. Following pultrusion method may be desirable in the instant invention Namely, in the first stage, metal fiber is manufactured by the pultrusion and about 5t to 80r of the resulting metal fibers are bundled in the second stage. In the third stage, said bundle of metal fibers is coated by elastomer s or plastic modified plastic s . Said elastomer may be such as styrene butadiene styrene block copolymer, styrene ethylbutylene and the like. Said coating is commonly carried out by using the extruder attached to the crosshead die. In the forth stage, said coated bundle of metal fiber s is cut by the cutting machine such as the pelletizer in a length from about 2 mm to 10 mm. Resulting coated and cut bundle of metal fibers is mixed with the resin A. In the above described method, knotting and tangling of metal fiber are effectively prevented by the coating of the elastomer s and metal fiber having diameter less than 5 flm and a length more than 10 mm can be used as metal filler of the instant invention, and further the following advantages may be considered. 1. Destruction of the metal fiber may be effectively prevented by the coating of the thermoplastic resin during mixing with the thermoplastic resin and the metal fiber can keep desirable length for electromagnetic shielding effectiveness. 2. In mixing with the resin A s , the elastomers s as coating of the bundle of metal fiber s is softened prior to the softening of the resin A and the bundled metal fibers are smoothly unbundled to be uniformly mixed with the resin A. F . 3. Usually the impact strength of the thermoplastic resin is reduced by mixing filler such as metal fiber. Nevertheless, mixed elastomer s may increase impact strength of the thermoplastic resin without adding agents for impact strength improvement. One or more kinds of the filler may be mixed to the resin A and the mixing amount of the filler may be controlled depending on the kind of the resin A, the kind of the filler, the combination between the resin A and the filler, the necessary fluidity of the resin A, the necessary electromagnetic.shielding effectiveness of the resultant housings and the like. Generally, desirable the mixing amount of the metal filler may be from 1 to 20 volume , because when the mixing amount of the filler is less than 1 volume , the electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of the resultant housings may be reduced, while the mixing amount of the filler is more than 20 volume , the the fluidity of the resin A may decrease and it may be difficult to obtain a good uniformity of the filler in the resin A.In particular, the desirable mixing amount of the metal fiber s and or metal flake s may be from 1 to 5 volume . Typical examples of combination of the filler and the resin A are shown in Table 2.EMI9.1 tb SEP Resin SEP A tb Filler SEP PolystyrenePolystyreneABSABSoxide tb SEP oxide tb fiber SEP 3 SEP 5 SEP SEP 2 tb Aluminum tb flake tb Aluminum SEP 4 SEP SEP 2 SEP tb fiber tb Copper tb fiber tb Table 2 Numerals in Table 2 show volume of the filler The housings having a two layer structure of the instant invention is manufactured by the two color injection molding machine. Namely, the first layer is injection molded by using the thermoplastic resin s in which metal filler s is are mixed and then the second layer is injection molded by using the thermoplastic resin s in which no electro conductive fillers are mixed. During said second injection molding, it may be necessary to keep the temperature of the first layer molded in the range of the softening point of 30 C.In this temperature range, the resulting housings may not warp and the two layers of the housings are strongly bonded to each other. If the temperature of the first layer molded is less than the softening point 300C, during the second injection molding, strong bonding of the two layers may not be obtained and if the temperature of the first layer molded is above the softening point of 300C, the first layer molded may be deformed during the second injection molding. The two color injection molding machine shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is advantageously used in the present invention. The resin A is combined according to such as the examples shown in Table 2 and uniformly mixed by the extruder to produce a compound. Referring to Figures, said compound is charged into a hopper 102 of a primary injection molding unit 101 and softened in a cylinder 103 by heating. On the other hand, the resin B selected according to such as the combinations shown in Table 1 is charged into a hopper 105 of a secondary injection molding unit 104 and softened in a cylinder 106 .

A secondary injection mold 114 consists of a secondary movable injection mold part 115 fixed on a secondary movable die plate 116 , and a secondary fixed injection mold part 117 fixed on the rotating die plate 111 . Both core parts 118 , 118 of the primary fixed injection mold part 110 and the secondary fixed injection mold part 117 have respectively the same shape and size. A cavity 121 for molding of the other layer is formed between the secondary movable injection mold part 115 and the secondary fixed injection mold part 117 , and the depth of the cavity 121 is larger than that of the cavity 112 by the thickness of one layer. A direct gate 119 connects the cavity 121 with the cylinder 106 . The resin A mixed with the metal fillers 123 is softened in the cylinder 103 as above described and injected into the cavity 112 through the direct gate 113 to mold the first layer 120 having bosses 120A , 120A .After a proper cooling time after the cooling time, the temperature of the first layer 120 molded should be kept with in the range of the softening point 300C , the primary movable injection mold part 108 is separated from the primary fixed injection mold part 110 and the molding material in the direct gate 113 is cut from the resulting first layer 120 molded, and then the rotating die plate 111 is rotated at an angle of 1800 with the primary fixed injection mold part 110 to combine the primary fixed injection mold part 110 with the secondary movable injection mold part 115 . The cavity 121 is thus formed between the primary fixed injection mold part 110 and the secondary movable injection mold part 115 and the layer 120 is to be inserted in the cavity 121 .On the other hand, the secondary fixed injection mold part 117 is also rotated at the same time to combine with the primary movable injecttion mold part 108 and the cavity 112 having boss parts 112A is also formed between the secondary fixed injection mold part 117 and the primary movable injection mold part 108 . After the mold clamping, the resin B softened in the cylinder 106 is injected into the cavity 112 through the direct gate 119 to mold the second layer 124 . After a proper cooling time, the primary movable injection mold part 108 is separated from the secondary fixed injection mold part 117 and the molding material in the, direct gate 119 is cut from the mold 122 , and thus the mold 122 shown in Fig. 3 is obtained.
