# Method and apparatus for a Fabrey Perot multiple beam fringe sensor.

## Abstract
A method and the resulting apparatus for implementing a unique multiple beam fringe sensor that is adapted to be interfaced with a low cost, compact fiber optic transmission system in order to provide an accurate digital representa tion of a physical parameter e. g. temperature of a re mote sample. The sensor is fabricated so as to include a Fabrey Perot gap 2 formed between the ends of two mated optical 10, 12 fibers. By examining the optical characteristics of light that is transmitted through the Fabrey Perot sensor gap 2 , an indication of gap width can be ascertained. Accordingly, a change in Fabrey Perot sensor gap width is related to a change in the particular physical parameter to be measured.
