# Induction heating apparatus and method of securing two workpieces or sheets.

## Abstract
A device for inductively heating and fusing thermoplas tics includes an alternating current passing through a tank circuit, the inductor member of the tank circuit being wrapped around a curved pole piece of a ferromagnatic material. The magnetic flux arising within the inductor coil member 29 flows to the ends of the pole piece 20 and is formed into a screen 45 placed between the materials to be joined. The flux induces a current in the screen, and heat is generated to melt the thermoplastics 41, 43 together. Only 30 150 watts of power need be passed through the tank circuit, as a wire which will remain cool under operational wattage may be selected, making air or fluid cooling unnecessary. The device can be used for joining thermoplastic workpieces, or for join ing non thermoplastic workpieces by means of a fastener containing thermoplastic material.

## Description
INDUCTION HEATING APPARATUS AND METHOD. This invention relates to an induction heating apparatus and to a method for securing two workpieces such as sheets by means of such apparatus. The apparatus has the particular advantage that it is suitable for use in environments where the use of known induction heaters is limited. Induction heating is well known in the art. When a current passes through a conductive coil, a magnetic flux is produced inside and around the coil. When a mass of conducting metal is moved in this magnetic field or is subjected to a changing flux, induced currents called eddy currents circulate in the mass. In most instances, eddy currents are wasted energy, but in induction heating they are the actual producers of heat. When welding thermoplastics, one places conducting metal either on top of a piece to be heated or between the two pieces to be joined. Thermoplastics are transparent to magnetic flux, so an induction heater can direct flux through the plastic to the metal. The heat produced in the conducting metal softens and joins the plastics. Many types of induction heaters are presently in use.Their use is limited, however, by several disadvantages.Induction heating presently involves passing a high power current, often of several kilowatts, through an inducting coil to effect high heat in the conducting metal. The coil suffers self induced power losses which are manifested as heat in the coil. If low power currents are passed through the coil, as in the invention of U.S. Patent No. 3,864,186, heat induced in the conducting metal is low. Air or fluid cooling has sufficed to keep high power systems from overheating, as in the heaters of U.S. PatentsNos. 4,120,712 and 3,738,892, but in a vacuum environment such as outer space, cooling systems are impractical, because energy is not readily available for their operation. With out a cooling system, an induction heater remains cool only if the coil is large enough to accommodate what power passes through it. A coil of a size able to accommodate the kilowatts necessary for induction of intense heat is prohibitively large. Induction heaters now in use are also limited in their efficiency. Generally, magnetic flux travels to the material to be heated in one of two ways. Either the coil is set atop the piece to be heated, or such a piece is placed within the coil. The latter method maximizes efficiency, but limits the size of materials which may be joined. Use of the former method results in losses of magnetic flux all around the coil. In fabrication of large items such as space structures, a portable induction heater which needs no external cooling is desirable for sealing seams and joining components. A portable heater ideally uses little power, which power may be readily obtained, and must be able to be controlled by easily miniaturized components. The present invention provides means for overcoming various disadvantages of the prior art. The present invention provides an induction heating apparatus characterised in that it comprises means for generating in combination magnetic flux, and means for focusing essentially all the magnetic flux generated to a point which is outside the area of generation and is in a member to be heated. The present invention also pr ovides methods for joint ing two workpieces by means of the apparatus of the present invention If the workpieces are of thermoplastic material, the heated member is located between them and causes them to intermix to effect a joint. If the workpieces are of non thermoplastic material, such as metal, there is placed between them a fastener comprising the member between two bodies of thermoplastic material the heated member causes the thermoplastic bodies to flow into perforations formed in the work pieces to effect a joint. Among the advantages of the invention are that the apparatus can be appropriate for use in special environments, such as outer space, or on the earth, or in motionless surroundings that an air or fluid cooling system need not be used that the apparatus makes use of essentially all the flux generated by an induction coil that the flux is transferred efficiently to a body outside the induction coil that the apparatus can be portable that it Can use low input power to accomplish high temperature melting and joining of materials and that power may be supplied by a small area of solar paneling. Generally, the apparatus will normally include a tank circuit, an inductive pole piece and a low power source.The inductive coil of the tank circuit encircles the pole piece. The pole piece is curved, its ends being nearly brought together. When a current of low power passes through the coil, the flux generated within the coil travels to the ends of the pole piece. The flux may then be conveyed to the material to be inductively heated for example, it may travel through a layer of thermoplastic to a wire screen, which screen inductively heats and melts the thermoplastic. The invention will be exemplified by the following description and the accompanying drawings wherein FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of the induction heating apparatus in the form of an induction gun positioned for use above material to be joined FIG. 2 is a cutaway view of thermoplastic materials to be joined and FiG. 3 is a cutaway view of the arrangement of materials used when two sheets of aluminum are t6 be joined. Referring now to FIG. 1, an induction heating gun constructed in accordance with this invention is represented generally by the reference numeral 10. The heating gun 10 is contained in a housing 15, and comprises a curved pole piece 20, a tank circuit designated generally by the reference numeral 25, and an input of electrical energy designated generally by the reference numeral 30. The pole piece 20 is constructed of an inductive material, e.g. powdered iron or an alloyed ferrite generally cylindrical in shape, it is curved such that its ends 21 and 22 approach each other but leave a gap 23 between themselves. The length of the gap 23 may be varied, as may be the composition and size of the pole piece 20, according to results desired. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the pole piece 20 is constructed from a toroid of powdered iron. A segment is removed from the toroid, leaving a gap 23 sufficient in length to allow heating of the materials to be joined. A filler piece 24 may be fitted into the gap 23. Such a filler piece 24 is made of a fluorocarbon polymer sold under the tradename of Teflon by the duPont Company, or a similar material. The tank circuit 25 includes a capacitor 27 and an inductor coil 29 havings ends 26 and 28. The inductor coil 29 may be of 10 gauge copper wire or other conductive material. The inductor coil 29 encircles the pole piece 20, such that it is in actual contact with the pole piece 20. The number of turns of the inductor coil 29 around the pole piece 20 varies with desired heating results, but excellent performance has been obtained with as few as three turns, and inductive heat has been produced by the magnetic flux generated by a single turn inductor coil. The ends 26 and 28 of the inductor coil 29 are connected to the capacitor 27. The capacitor 27 may be single, as depicted in FIG. 1, or several capacitors may be connected in parallel. In the preferred embodiment, the resultant tank circuit 25 has a reactance of about 70 ohms. The capacitor 27 of the tank circuit 25 connects to the input of electrical energy 30. FIG. 1 shows a suggested arrangements of components which control the characteristics of the electrical input 30. In theory, any combination of elements providing 30 watts or more of power to the tank circuit 25 may be used. In the preferred embodiment ofFIG. 1, an oscillator 31 and amplifier 35 regulate the frequency and current supplied to the tank circuit 25. The oscillator 31 converts a direct current to an alternating current of a chosen frequency the amplifier 35 increases the strength of the electrical impulse given to the tank circuit 25. The ultimate source of electrical energy may be any of those known in the art. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, solar energy is suggested. Twenty square feet of solar paneling 37 generally supplies the power necessary to bond thermoplastics using the apparatus and method of the present invention. The solar paneling 37 shown here is a source of direct current and alternating current input is also usable. The heating gun 10 may be housed in a portable container. The oscillator 31 and amplifier 35 may be miniaturized or transistorized and placed within the housing to make the entire system compact and portable.A suggested housing 15 is shown in FiG 1, enclosing the heating gun 10. Made of plastic, it includes a handle 17, a power switch 18 and a power input receptacle 19. The handle 17 allows manual positioning and movement of the heating gun over an area of materials to be joined. The power switch 18, electrically connected to the input of electrical energy 30, controls supply of electrical current to tank circuit 25. The power input receptacle is one or more apertures designed to receive the current carrying wires of the input of electrical energy 30. Turning now to FIG. 2, a typical arrangement of materials to be joined is seen in cutaway view. Sheets 41 and 43 of thermoplastic or other suitable organic matrix composite may be joined by the method of the present invention. The sheets 41 and 43 need not be identical in composition a polysulfone, for example, may be joined to an acrylic, or a graphite Acrylic composite material to a glass polysulfone. The sheets 41 and 43 may range in thickness from very thin up to about 0.64 cm each, under the present method. A screen 45 of a high resistance, low reluctance metal is placed between the sheets 41 and 43 to be joined. The thickness of the wires 46 making up the screen 45 may vary with heating results desired and with the degree of structural stiffening expected of the screen 45. In the preferred embodiment, a carbon steel screen 45, or 28 gauge wire and 26 mesh screen is used. A perforated metal sheet or scattered metal particles may be substituted for the screen 45. Returning to FIG. 1, the operation of the induction heater is easily understood. The following description refers to the sheets 41 and 43 being joined as thermoplastics the reference is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. A wire screen 45 is placed between the sheets 41 and 43 to be joined. The heating gun is positioned above the sheets 41 and 43 and the screen 45, with the ends 21 and 22 of the pole piece 20 touching one sheet 41, and with the 20 gap 23 of the pole piecetdocated above the area of sheets 41 an d 43 to be joined. When the power switch 18 is moved to engage an electrical input 30, an alternating current enters the tank circuit 25. The capacitor 27 increases the Q of the tank circuit 25, in turn increasing the current flow through the inductor coil 29. Direction of the current along the inductor coil 29 reverses at each cycle of alternating current. Current flow in the inductor coil 29 creates a magnetic flux within the turns of the coil 29. The flux is picked up by the pole piece 20 and carried to an end 21 or 22. The flux then jumps to the wire screen 45 rather than across the gap 23 to the other end 22 or 21. The flux is readily transferred to the screen 45 through a sheet 41 of thermoplastic because thermoplastics are transparent to magnetic flux. Since direction of current in the inductor coil 29 changes very rapidly, the flux is constantly changing in magnitude and direction at any given point. This is true in the petal screen 45 as well as in the pole piece 20.Hysteresis creates eddy currents in the screen 45, which currents are manifested as heat in the screen 45 The system is tuned so that the heat produced in the wire screen 45 is sufficient to warm to melting temperature the adjacent sheets 41 and 43 of material to be joined without burning or destroying said layers. The thermoplastics 41 and 43 soften and flow around the apertures of the screen and fuse with one another. When the system has cooled, a strong bond has been formed between the now joined sheets 41 and 43. The wire screen 45 remains within the fused sheets 41 and 43, and adds support to structures formed from the thermoplastics. The heating gun 10 may induce heat at one given point, or may be moved along a seam at a controlled speed. The exact specifications of a given induction heating gun 10 vary with the results desired in its operation. A great advantage of the heating gun 10 is that it may be tuned to effect high heat in a screen 45 with a low power input. A few general suggestions and a specific example follow. As mentioned before, the pole piec e 20 is preferably an altered toroid, made of powdered iron or an alloyed ferrite material. It is large in diameter and length as compared to the wires of the screen 45. Its relatively large size allows a large flux to pass through it without heating it, and when that flux passes to the thinner wires of the screen 45, high heating results. The gap 23 of the pole piece 20 may vary in size. The gap 23 is put in the pole piece to allow flux to pass from 20 the pole piecelto the metal screen 45. The gap 23 must therefore be wide enough to encourage flux to jump from an end 21 or 22 of the pole piece Hzothe screen 45 rather than to the opposite end 22 or 21 of the pole piece 20. This usually means that the gap 23 is wider than the distance between end 21 and the screen 45, or between end 22 and the screen 45. In general, more heat per area is induced as the width of the gap 23 is decreased, but the thickness of the sheets 41 and 43 to be joined must also decrease. As mentioned above, an object of this invention is to provide inductive heating for which a cooling system is not needed. Since low power 30 150 watts is sufficient to effect high heat through the heating gun 10, the components of the gun remain cool in operation. The thickness of the inductor coil wire 29 may vary, but is chosen to remain cool when the wattage to be used passes through it. Frequency may also be adjusted in the heating gun 10.The highest efficient frequency tested has been approximately 200,000 Hz. but a frequency of up to 1,000,000 Hz could regulate the heating nun 10. Reactance of the tank circuit is generally about 7051. but will vary with the frequency output of the amplifier 35. The screen 45 is chosen for both its high resistance and low reluctance and its stiffening qualities. Iron alloys have been used in test ing with a greater energy input, alloys of other materials such as copper, aluminum and the like may be substituted. Looking at one embodiment of the invention, a toroid of powdered iron was selected, of inside diameter 3.94cm. outside diameter 7.37cm, and thickness 1.27cm. A segment 0.873cm long was removed, leaving a curved pole piece 20.A filler piece 24 of Teflon was fitted to fill the gap 23. An inductor coil 29 of three turns of 10 gauge copper wire was wrapped around the curved pole piece 20, and connected to a capacitor 27 of capacitance of 0.7 f The gun 10 was used ts inductively heat two sheets 41 and 43 of acrylic, each sheet 0.32cm thick. An iron carbon alloy wire screen 45, of 28 gauge wire and 26 mesh screen was placed between the sheets 41 and 43. An alternating current of 100 watts and 120,000 Hz was passed through the tank circu it 25. In three seconds, 0.285 Btu of heat was produced in the metal screen 45, which heat was sufficient to join the sheets 41 and 43 of acrylic. A similar method is used to join two sheets of metal.Turning now to FIG. 3, an arrangement suitable for joining two sheets of aluminum is seen. Two aluminum sheets 47 and 49 are selected and perforations 50 are made over the area to be joined. Between the sheets 47 and 49 are placed two sheets of thermoplastic 41 and 43 and a wire screen 45, in the arrangement already seen in FIG. 2, at the area to be joined. A heating gun is positioned above but not in direct contact with the aluminum sheets 47 and 49. Heat induced through the heating gun 10 melts the plastics 41 and 43. The plastics 41 and 43 flow into the perforations 50 of the aluminum sheets 47 and 49, and upon cooling form strong points of joining. Metal sheets may be joined at one area, or a seam can be formed by movement of the heating gun 10. In the preferred mode of operation, for convenience the thermoplastics 41 and 43 and the screen 45 are heated and made into a fastener before the joining process begins.This is not necessary, nor is it only possible to bond metal to metal. A perforated sheet of aluminum may, for example , be joined to a sheet of acrylic. The number and size of perforations 50 is for each material to be bonded with respect to its strength and that desired of the bond. The invention just described allows high inductive heating with low power input. The low power input makes external cooling systems unnecessary, allowing the heater to be used in outer space, or any vacuum or motionless environment. The many adjustable components make the heater usable for heating many types of material. The heater is portable and efficient. The specifications herein discussed are not meant as limitations on the scope of the invention and its underlying theory. The above description refers to one embodiment of the invention other embodiments will be obvious to those skilled in the art.
