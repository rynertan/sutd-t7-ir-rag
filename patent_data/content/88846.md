# Mirror.

## Abstract
A mirror made of a synthetic plastics material in the shape of a shallow tray having a base 5 which is metallised on its internal or external surface at 12 or 13. The shallow tray has rim 6, 7, 9 integral with the periphery of the base. The shape of the cross section of the rim enables the peripheral edge at the front of the mirror to be convexly rounded at 8 to a required radius greater than the thickness of the base 5. The rim section also serves to hold the base 5 from distortion and so maintains the optical properties of the mirror.
