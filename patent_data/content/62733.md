## Description
METAL ION FREE PHOTORESIST DEVELOPER COMPOSITIONIntroductionThis invention relates to novel aqueous alkaline developer compositions for photosensitive resists and the use thereof.More specifically, it relates to high speed developer compositions which are metal ion free.Background of the inventionIn the manufacture of integrated circuit devices, printed circuit boards, printing plates, and in related arts, resist processes are used whereby photomechanical images are formed on a substrate to protect selected portions of the substrate during subsequent manufacturing processes such as, for example, etching, metal deposition, and diffusion processes. The resist processes employ radiation sensitive organic compositions which are coated onto the substrate surface and then exposedpatternwise to light or other suitable actinic radiation such as, for example, x rays, gamma rays, or an electron beam. The exposed resist layer is then developed by methods known in the art and the portions of the substrate which are bared by development can then be treated.Both positive and negative working photoresists are known.A positive resist is composed typically of a base soluble binder such as phenol formaldehyde novolak resin and a sensitizer, that is, a photoactive compound, such as a diazo compound.Such sensitiers and resists are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Numbers 3 ,O46,118 3,046,121 3,106,465 3,201,239 3,666,473 4,009,033 and 4,093,461 which are each incorporated herein by reference. Other resets include, for example, acrylic resists and polyimide resists.In manufacturing processes employing photoresists, the rate of production is dependent upon the time required to form the photomechanical image which, in turn, depends in part on the time required to expose the resist to the necessary amount of activating radiation and on the time required to then develop the latent image bearing resist. Accordingly, four interrelated factors determine the rate of product through put radiation intensity and exposure time, and developing solution concentration and solution contact time.Typically, exposed resists will dissolve in developer solution of a given concentration at a certain rate. This is true whether development is by immersion or by puddle or spray techniques. Generally, solution contact time is pre set. The minimum necessary exposure time to achieve complete development of the photoresist is then determined, often by trial and error. Underexposure of the photoresist generally cannot be effectively off set by using developing solution above the recommended concentration since this normally will result in significant loss of selectivity. That is, a greater portion of unexposed resist will be dissolved along with the exposed portion. Consequently, there is a disadvantageous loss of resolution in the photomechanical image and, therefore in the quality of the subsequently treated substrate.Accordingly, in a typical manufacturing process employing a source of actinic radiation of certain intensity, the proper exposure time is determined by first setting the time longer than necessary and decreasing it incrementally until the photomechanical image is just developed during the pre set solution contact time. Thus, for example, where development is by immersion for 60 seconds in a developing solution, the exposure time is adjusted downward until development is just completed in the 60 second immersion time.A significant disadvantage inherent in the use of known developers relates to metal ion contamination of the work piece, especially integrated circuit devices and the like.The ever smaller lines and spaces being used for circuitry of such devices make it necessary that there be no contamination by current carrying metal ions, since the functional properties of the device could be affected.Known developers comprise metal ions and thus can cause metal ion contamination. Inadequate rinsing df the device after development of the photomechanical image can result in metal ion contamination and this is especially troublesome with automatic in line developing methods, in which there is no immersion rinse. Metal ion contamination can cause failure of finished IC devices.Summary of the InventionAccording to the present invention, the foregoing objects are achieved by a novel metal ion free developer composition.More specifically, the invention provides an aqueous metal ion free developer composition comprising a metal ion free alkali and a metal ion free surfactant comprising one or more quaternary ammonium compounds as defined below. According to a method aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of developing a photoresist by contacting it with the above described aqueous metal ion free developer composition.The developer composition of the invention provides a significant advance in the art in that the exposure energy required to form the photomechanical resist image is reduced by as much as 40 to 50 . Yet, image quality and resolution are substantially improved over that obtained by the use of known developers.Detailed DescriptionThe present invention provides a novel aqueous alkaline developer for photoresist. It operates preferably at a temperature of approximately 100 to 300C, more preferably at about 200C or room temperature.The developer composition of the invention can be used in any manner suitable for known developers. Thus, immersion, spray, and puddle techniques can be used. The photoresist to be developed is generally applied to a substrate, image wise exposed to actinic radiation and subsequently contacted with the developer. Development of the photomechanical image typically requires about 60 seconds if by immersion, less if by spray or puddle techniques. Subsequent to development, the work piece can then be rinsed and further processed as desired.Metal ion free alkali suitable for use in the novel developer composition of the invention are usually, but not necessarily, water soluble and must provide the necessary alkalinity. The novel developer composition of the invention operates preferably at a pH of from about 11 to 12.7, most preferably about 12.5. While the developer will function at a pH above 12.7, there can be significant attack on the unexposed portions of the resist with consequent decline in the resolution quality of the photomechanical image. Below about pH 11 there is significant decrease in the speed of development.Suitable sources of alkali include, for example, aryl and alkyl amines including primary, secondary and tertiary substituted amines, wherein the substituents can be straight, branched or cyclic. Suitable amines include, for example, alkylene diamines such as, for example, 1,3 diamino propane, and aryl amines, for example, 4,4diamino diphenylamine. Also suitable are imines, for example, BIS dialkylamino imine. Preferably, alkyl substituents comprise from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Preferred aryl substituents include phenyl and phenalkyl. Also suitable as a source of alkali is heterocyclic base, such as, for example, those comprising a ring having 3 to 5 carbon atoms with 1 or 2 heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, for example, pyrrole, pyrollidine, pyrollidone, pyridine, morpholine, pyrazine, piperidine, oxazole and thiazole. Another suitable source of alkali is the quaternary ammonium bases such as, for example, the lower alkyl quaternary ammonium hydroxides and the like. Preferred alkali include tetraalkylammonium hydroxides, therein each alkyl substituent is the same or different and has from 1 to 3 carbons. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide ismost preferred.The metal ion free surfactant of the developer composition of the invention comprises one or, preferably, a mixture of quaternary ammonium compounds having the general formula EMI6.1 whereinR1 comprises a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched hydrocarbon chain having from 6 to 20 carbons, and from zero to 3 oxygens, provided that each oxygen can be separated from others by at least one carbon, and which is alkoxy substituted or unsubstituted R2 and R3 are the same or different and each comprises alkyl of from 1 to 3 carbons or R50 nH whereon R5 is alkylene of 1 to 3 carbons and n is an integer from 1 to 20 or R2 and R3 together comprise a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon of from 2 to 8 carbons with from zero to 2 heteroatom selected from 0, N, and S, provided that each heteroatom be separated from another and from the quaternary nitrogen by at least one carbon or R2 and R3 together comprise a cycloaromatic hydrocarbon of from 2 to 8 carbons with from zero to two nitrogen heteroatoms, provided that each nitrogen atom be separated from another and from the quaternary nitrogen by at least one carbon R4 comprises a saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched hydrocarbon having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, R50 nH as defined above, phealkyl, wherein the alkyl moiety has fromO to 3 carbons, orEMI6.2 wherein m is from 1 to 4 R2 und R3 are as defined above, and R6 is saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched hydrocarbon having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or R50 nH as defined above, or phenol alyl having an alkyl group of from 0 to 3 carbon atoms andX comprises halo, hydroxy, or silicate, or the corresponding amino oxide of said quaternary ammonium compounds. 2Preferably, there are in R , R3, and R4, in total, no more than 15 alkoxy units, R50 , most preferably, no more than 2.Preferred for use in the invention are quaternary ammonium compounds having the general formula II EMI7.1 whereinR1 and X are defined for formula I R7 and R8 are the same or different and each comprises alkyl of from 1 to 3 carbons, or R5O nH wherein n is 1 and R5 is as defined for formula I and Ri comprises a saturated or unsaturated, straight, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon having from 1 to 10 carbons, R50 nH wherein n is 1 and R5 is defined for formula I, phenalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has from 0 to 3 carbons, orEMI7.2 wherein m is from 1 to 4, R6 and R7 are as defined above, andR10 is saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched hydrocarbon having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, or R50 nH as defined above or phenalkyl having an alkyl group of from 0 to 3 carbon atoms.Metal in free developers according to the inventioncomprising one or more surfactants of formula II above, have been found more selective in developing exposed areas of photoresist, and to have little or no attack on the unexposed photoresist. A metal ion free developer, made according to the invention, markedly reduces the required exposure time to create the required image by from forty to fifty percent, and thus increases wafer throughput.By comparison, using known developers, a reduction of exposure time by forty to fifty percent cannot be achieved even by using a bath of increased concentration, because of attack on the unexposed photoresist. Thus, known developers show much less selectivity between exposed andunexposed areas.Among the preferred surfactants are those comprising ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds having the general formula EMI8.1 wherein m and p are each 1 or 2 and R1 is alkyl of from 8 to 18 carbon atoms in approximately the following proportions TABLE I R1 carbon chain length C8 5 C10 6 C12 51 C14 19 C16 9 C18 5Most preferably such surfactants comprise ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds wherein m and p are each 1, that is, methylbis 2 hydroxyethyl cocoammonium chloride.Such surfactants can be derived from coconut oil, and one such is commercially available under the trademark ETHOQUAD C 12 Armak Co., Pasadena, Texas, sold as a 758 active solution .Also preferred are the compounds of the formula I wherein R2, R3 and R4 are alkyl of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, most preferably methyl, and R1 is as defined in formula IV.Most preferred of such surfactants is trimethylcocoammonium chloride, which surfactant can be derived from coconut oil and is commercially available under the trademark ARQUAD C 50 Armak Company, Pasadena, Texas, sold as a 50 active solution .Another preferred surfactant comprises a mixture of two compounds, one conforming to formula IV where R1 has 12 carbon atoms and m and p total 15 and the second whereinR1 is 908 C18 and 10 C16. This surfactant is available under the trademark ETHOQUAD 18 25 Armak Company,Pasadena, Texas, sold as a 90 active solution . The amount of such surfactant employed in the developer composition of the invention will depend in part upon the quaternary ammonium compound s chosen and the particular application for which it is used. Thus, for example, if the surfactant comprises ETHOQUAD C 12, described above, and the alkali is tetramethylammonium hydroxide TMAH , the total amount used is from 0.02 to 45 grams of active C 12 per kgm TMAH, and more preferably, from about 0.1 to 7.5 grams of active C 12 per kgm of TMAH. In one most preferred embodiment, from about 0.2 to 10 grams of active ETHOQUAD C 12 is used in conjunction with from about 1 to 4 grams of activeETHOQUAD 18 25 per kgm TMAH.The quaternary ammonium compounds, one or more of which comprises the surfactant of the developer compositions, can be readily prepared according to methods well known to those skilled of the art. Alternately, many suitable compounds or, preferably, mixtures of compounds, are readily commercially available. While not intending to be bound by theory, it is currently believed that the newly discovered efficacy of the compounds of formula I results from their ability to reduce the surface tension of the developer bath at the interface with the photoresist. Thus, there is improved wetting of the exposed photoresist with the developer continuously through the development of the photomechanical image. In this way, the alkali of the developer has better contact and thus more effective action on the acids of the exposed portions of the resist.It is theorized that such ability to reduce surface tension stems in large part from the affinity of the hydrophobic R1 moiety, for the polymeric resin of the photoresist. In this regard, it is further theorized that surfactants comprising a mixture of such compounds, wherein the length of the R1 carbon claim varies, are especially efficatious because the resin system typically also comprises carbon chains of varied length. For example, in the case of a novolak resin there are different novolak resin structures. Thus, different R1 chain lengths provide the greatest affinity and hence the greatest wetting action for each of those different structures. Thus, a synergistic effect is achieved through the combined action of the different length R1 carbon chains.In addition to the alkali and surfactant described above, the developer composition of the invention may further comprise one or more suitable polyhydric compounds.Suitable polyhydric compounds for use in aqueous alkaline developers are known to the skilled of the art and include glycerol, ethylene glycol and polyglycols and glycol ethers. Glycerol is preferred. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that glycerol, or other suitable polyhydric compounds, act as abetting agent and solvent and improves the quality of the photomechanical image. Amounts up to about 35 grams per liter of glycerol have been found to be particularly suitable.Preferably, an amount of about 25 to 30 grams per liter is used, most preferably about 27 grams per liter.The present invention provides a novel metal ion free, high speed de wloper suitable for development of positive type photoresists, It is believed to be suitable for etching unsensitized polyamide films in two layer processing. It is particularly effective for development of positive photoresist containing diazotype sensitizer, such as 1 oxo 2 diazi naphthalene 5 sulfonate ester in a novolak resin system. Such positivetype photoresists include, for example, the AZ 1300 series and AZ 1400 series photoresists marketed byShipley Company Inc. of Newton, Massachusetts. The developer of the invention is also highly effective for development of such photoresists containing different sensitizers, for example, 1 oxo 2 diazonaphthalene 4sulfonate ester or other photoactive materials known to the skilled of the art.The developer dissolves those portions of such photoresists which have been exposed to actinic radiation, with improved selectivity. That is, even when the amount of exposure energy is reduced, the developer composition of the invention will dissolve the exposed portion s with less attack on the unexposed portion s than known developers. Thus, better image resolution and quality is provided while the rate of production is increased due to the reduced exposure time.The developer composition of the invention can comprise components in addition to those described above. Such other components include, for example, dyes, additional wetting agents, buffers, and others known to the skilled in the art. However, while such additional components can comprise metal ions, the preferred embodiments of the invention are metal ion free. It is a significant advantage of such preferred embodiments that work pieces, such as integrated circuit devices, are not contaminated by metal ions from the developer composition. In this regard, the metal ion free developer compositions according to such preferred embodiments are espcially advantageous for use with automated, in line developing methods in which there is no rinse of the reverse side of the device after development of the photomechanical image.Often in such applications, a portion of the developer solution is not rinsed away and ion contamination of the device results. However, if metal ion free developer according to the present invention is employed, such unrinsed developer will not cause metal ion contamination of the work piece.Accordingly, not only is there increased speed of production and improved quality, there is also the elimination of metal ion contamination and consequent device failure.The following examples will illustrate the invention and is not intended to be taken as a limitation thereof.Example IA photoresist developer composition according to the invention was prepared as follows to 14706 ml of deionized water was added 1000 gm of tetramethylammonium hydroxide.Next was added 511 of glycerol. Next was added 7.125 gm of active ETHOQUAD C 12 Armak Co. . Finally, an additional 10,000 ml of deionized water was added. The above was mixed for half an hour and was ready for dilution to suit the desired processing conditions.Example IIThe speed and selectivity of the instant developer composition was compared to that of known developers. Silicon wafers, each of 3 inches diameter, were coated with AZ 1470 photoresist Shipley Company Inc., Newton, Massachuesetts at a thickness of 1.4 . The coated wafers were exposed 2 with 45 millijoules cm energy from an actinic radiation source through a graduated density stepfilter. The wafers, 3 each, were immersion developed for 20 seconds in 1 of 4 developer solutions and immersion rinsed in deionized water for 60 seconds and then blown dry with N2. The first 3 solutions were separate batches of developer solution made according to the method of Example I.The fourth bath was MF 312 Developer Shipley Company, Newton, MA. pre pared by mixing 3 parts developer and 2 parts deionized water, and used according to directions. All solutions were used at 22.50C. Following development the resist layers were again measured for thickness to determine selectivity, that is, the amount of loss of unexposed resist, and visually examined to determine the percent transmission needed for complete development.

The test results show that the metal ion free developer is approximately 2.1 times faster, that is, requires 2.1 times less exposure energy, than the MF312 developer used as a control.Moreover, regarding selectivity, visual composition of the wafers under a microscope revealed that each batch of the metal ion free developer of the invention had virtually no effect on the photoresist receiving less than approximately 18 to 20 transmission. Thus, unless having received at least about 22.5 transmission and being developed completely, the photoresist was unattacked by the developer. By comparison, photoresist developed with MF 312 which received less than the 48 transmission needed for complete development, over a broad range down to 1.0 was attacked by the developer to a significant extent.Example IIIMetal ion free developer according to Example I herein MIF was diluted to 5 parts developer and 1 part D.I.water and compared to a known developer MF312 a standardShipley product at a dilution of three parts developer to two parts deionized water over a temperature range from 14 0C to 260C. Selectivity was measured as the loss of unexposed resist.Twenty eight 28 wafers, each 3 inches diameter, were spin coated with 1.5 AZ 1470 photoresist ShipleyCompany, Newton, MA at 2500 RMP. The coated wafers were exposed to actinic radiation of 45 millijoules cm 2 through a step mask.
