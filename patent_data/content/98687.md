# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device including burying an insulating film.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device is disclosed which comprises the step of forming one or more first groove by selectively etching a field region of a semiconductor substrate 21 , the step of forming, on the entire surface of the substrate 21 including the first groove, a first insulating film 24 having a thickness substantially equal to or greater than the depth of the first groove, this first insulating film 24 having on its upper surface one or more second grooves corresponding to the first groove, at least one of the second grooves having a width greater than its depth, the step of selectively forming, in at least one of the second grooves having a width greater than its deepth, a second insulating film 25 having a thickness substantially equal to the depth of the second groove, the step of forming a third insulating film 26 having a flat surface on its whole surface, the step of applying an anisotropic dry etching technique to the resultant structure to expose the surface of the substrate 21 , thereby obtaining a substrate 21 which has a flat surface and having the first insulating material 24 buried in the field region, and the step of forming a semiconductor element in the surface region of the substrate 21 isolated by the first insulating material 24 buried in the field region of the substrate 21 .
