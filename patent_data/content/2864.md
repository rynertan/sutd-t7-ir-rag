# A process for preparing linear and or radial polymers.

## Abstract
Linear and or radial polymers are prepared by using new silicon compounds having at least one hydrocarboxy group and at least one other reactive group such as an epoxide group for coupling alkali terminated polymers obtained by anionic polymerisation of a mono alkenyl compound and or a conjugated diene.
