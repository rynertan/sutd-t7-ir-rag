# Milking apparatus.

## Abstract
A milking apparatus comprises sets of electrodes for detecting milk flows sucked by individual teat cups capped on individual teats, tubes connected to pressure chambers of the respective teat cups, change over valves operative to supply atmospheric pressure and vacuum periodically and alternately to the tubes, counters for counting times for non detection of the milk flows by the sets of electrodes, and controller for actuating the change over valves to supply only atmospheric pressure to the tubes when the counted times of the counters exceed a predetermined time.
