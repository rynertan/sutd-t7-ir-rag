# Electro optic line printer.

## Abstract
A thick film line modulator scanner for use in an electro optic line printer. A light valve utilizes an electro optic layer 212 with the index of refraction of the layer being higher than the neighbouring material so that the light can be guided in it. A laser beam is directed into the layer, the beam expanding sideways so that a sheet of collimated light is provided. This light is affected by an array of electrodes 240, 242 consisting of an extended set of individually addressed metal fingers 240 on one side of the film 212 , and a broad electrode 242 on the other side of the film. This broad electrode could also be segmented to correspond to the individually addressed electrodes. The light diffracted by this electrode set is reimaged onto the recording medium with the zero order diffracted light blocked out, so that each electrode acts as a light modulator for one picture element on the output.
