# Process for the detoxification of chemical waste materials.

## Abstract
A process for the detoxification of chemical waste materials, comprising toxic organic compounds in which the waste materials are subjected to electrolytical treatment by contacting them with one or more electrodes, which are part of an electrical circuit, in the presence of a micelie forming material. The miceile forming material is added in a quantity of 1 100 ppm on the basis of the waste material and consists preferably of octadecyltrimethylammoniumchloride or a mixture of quaternary ammonium salts. The anode may be made of titanium or lead dioxide, the cathode may be made of lead, or both may be made of carbon fibres. The process is especially suitable for removing halogen ated hydrocarbons from chemical waste materials.
