# Preconditioned memory cell.

## Abstract
A CMOS memory cell is disclosed which has a latent image feature for application in FET memory arrays for writable read only storage applications. A four device cross coupled CMOS memory cell is formed with minimum real estate area, so as to allow for wiring level programming into a preconditioned binary one or zero state. The preconditioned CMOS memory cell will assume a preselected binary state when power is turned on. Thereafter, the cell can be accessed for normal binary one and zero selective storage without a significant diminution in its operating characteristics, when compared with conventional CMOS cross coupled memory cells.
