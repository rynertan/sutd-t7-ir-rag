# DIGITAL COLOR MODIFICATION

## Abstract
A digital display system including a memory containing digital representations of a three color component color image connected through a network of look up tables and summing circuits to the red, green and blue display drivers of a suitable display. In particular, a first summing circuit is connected to the red display driver, a second summing circuit is connected to the green display driver, and a third summing circuit is connected to the blue display driver. Three look up tables are connected to the red digital representation in memory with one of the look up tables being connected to the first summing circuit, another of the look up tables being connected to the second summing circuit and the third look up table being connected to the third summing circuits. In a similar manner, groups of three look up tables are connected to the green and blue digital representations and each look up table of each group in turn connected to a different summing circuit. The result is nine look up tables cross coupled to three summing circuits to provide selected color adjustments and transformations.
