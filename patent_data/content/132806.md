## Description
METHOD OF PROCESSING SILVER HALIDE COLOR LIGHT SENSITIVE MATERIALS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of processing silver halide color light sensitive materials using a reduced amount of a bleach fix replenisher solution.More particularly, it relates to a method of processing silver halide color light sensitive materials, by which contamination of color light sensitive materials is substantially prevented and formation of a leuco form of dyes is substantially prevented. BACKGROUND DF THE INVENTION Generally, in order to obtain color images by carrying out development processing of an imagewise exposed silver halide color light sensitive material, a process generally is used which comprises bleaching metallic silver formed upon a color development step with an oxidizing agent bleaching agent followed by fixing with a silver halide fixing agent. For the purpose of shortening photographic processing steps or processing time, or reducing of labor, a process is also used which comprises a bleachfixing step in which the bleaching step is combined with the fixing step. Typical bleach fix solutions used for such a process have been described in West German Patents 866,605 and 966,410, British Patent 1,014,396, U.S.Patents 3,189,452 and 3,615,508, and Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 781 71, 13934 72, 65940 73 and 140128 75 the term OPI as used herein refers to a published unexamined Japanese patent application , etc. In the bleach fix solution, a bleaching agent oxidizing agent and a fixing agent must be present together in a stabilized state. Since the thiosulfates used cniefly as fixing agents are reducing agents, a comparatively weak oxidizing agent such as a metal complex of an organic acic is selected as the bleaching agent. Thus, the prepared bleach fix solution is inherently inferior in oxidation ability as compared with the bleaching soinrion Consequently, known methods of processing color light sensitive materials with a bleach fix solution have the disadvantage that dyes are not completely formed, because the leuco dyes formed in the color development step are not sufficiently oxidized in the bleach fixing step and remain present as leuco dyes which are reaction intermediates.This phenomenon of inferior recovery of color is remarkable in the case of cyan dyes. Furthermore, in recent years, in order to meet environmental requirements, in to economize and to reduce labor, there has been a tendency to reduce replenishing amounts of processing solutions. However, when the replenishing amount of the bleach fix solution is greatly reduced, unsuitable contamination of sensitive materials adhesion of contaminants and formation of fog occurs, and it becomes very difficult to avoid both inferior recovery of color and contamination at the same time. Various methods of improving the inferior recovery of color are known. For example, a method wherein bromic acid salts or persulfates are added to a bleaching solution is described in Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 17732 74 corresponding to U. S. Patent 3,770,437 and 65939 76, this method has the disadvantage that bleaching fog is formed. A method which comprises oxidizing leuco substances with ferricyanides to change them into dyes after processing with a bleach fix solution is dex closed inJapanese Patent Application OPI2 Nos. 43938 73, 45238 73, and 46334 73, but this method is not suitable because it causes environmental pollution. A method wherein bromic acid salts and iodides or bromides are added to a bleach fix solution is disclosed in U. S.Patent 3,770,437, but it is not suitable because it deteriorates the stability of the bleach fix solution and bleaching fog is formed. A method which comprises processing with a solution contaning persulfates as a pre bath or post bath of the bleach fix bath is also know from Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 26139 73, but it is unsuitable for practical use, because of inferior recovery of color and formation of bleaching fog.Further, a method wherein various aminopolycarboxylic acid metal complexes are combined is described in Japanese PatentPublication No. 38894 79, but this is not a practical method, because stability of the bleach fix solution is inferior and the cost is disadvantageous. Moreover, a method wherein p phenylenediamines or pyrazolidones are added to the bleach fixing solution is described inJapanese Patent Publication No. 23179 76 and a method wherein alkanolanines are added to the bleach fix solution is described in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 192953 82, but both methods show an inferior effect. Several methods of preventing fog, are known, e.g , a method wherein amines are added to the Xleach fix solution described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 55 71 corresponding to U.S. Patent 3,578,453 a method wherein bromides or iodides are added, described in JapanesePatent Publication No. 11854 78 corresponding to U.S.Patent 4,040,837 and a method wherein 3 pyrazolidones or p aminophenols are added, described in British Patents 1,132,399 and 1,133,530. These known methods, however, are insufficient in effect. No satisfactory method has been known of preventing contamination of sensitive materials particularly formation of fog caused in the bleach fixing step and avoiding inferior recovery of color while greatly reducing the replenishing amount of bleach fix solution required, although these problems are well known in the art. SU Y w Y OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of processing silver halide color light sensitive materials, by which the replenishing amount of bleach fix solution required is greatly reduced and contamination of the light sensitive materials and inferior recovery of color are prevented. This object is attained by the method of the present invention, which comprises the steps of color developing a silver halide color light sensitive material, substantially washing 15e silaer hali e color light sensitive material with water for 5 to 90 seconds and thereafter bleacn f ixing in a bath which is replenished by the addition of a standard replenisher solution in a reduced amount of from from about 30 ml to 120 ral per Tn of silver halide color light sensitive material. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Although it is known from Japanese PatentApplication OPI No. 192953 82 to use a water wash bath between a color development step and a bleach fixing step, there is no disclosure that by using such a washing step the replenishing amount of the bleach fixing solution can be remarkably reduced as in the present invention, and, further, there is no disclosure regarding contamination of the light sensitive materials or inferior recovery of color due to the remarkable reduce. It is an entirely unexpected discovery that the above described problems of contamination of sensitive materials and inferior recovery of color, can be solved while greatly reducing the replenishing amount of the bleach fix solution required by providing a water wash step as in the present invention. In the color development step in the present invention, the processing temperature is typically about 250C to 500C and, preferably, about 300C to 420C.The processing time is 30 seconds to 10 minutes and, preferably, about 1 minute to 5 minutes. Further, the replenishing amount is about 50 ml to 600 ml and, preferably, about 2 100 ml to 500 ml per m2 of the sensitive material.

The second washing step may be carried out by any method, but a multistage counter current washing process wherein water runs as a counter current from the post bath to the pre bath is preferably used. The number of baths for counter current washing is typically 2 to 10 and, preferably 2 to 9.Further in order to improve washing efficiency, the washing tank may be fitted with a heater to increase the washing temperature or may be fitted with an air bubbling apparatus.The amount of water for washing varies widely according to the method of washing, but it is generally, in a range of about 500 ml to 50 g and, preferably, about 1 Q to 30 Q per m2 of the light sensitive material.

The method of processing nE the present invention can be applied to processing of any conventional silver halide color photographic materials such as color negative films, color papers, color positive films or color reversal films. It is particularly preferred to apply the present method to the processing of color papers. The photographic emulsions used in the present invention can be prepared by processes described in P.Glafkides, Chimie et Physique Photographique, Paul MontelCo., 1967 , G.F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry, Focal Press, 1966 , and V.L. Zelikmann et al., Making andCoating Photographic Emulsion, Focal Press, 1964 .They may be prepared by any conventional process, including the acid process, neutral process and ammonia process.Further, to react soluble silver salts with soluble halogen salts, the single jet mixing process, the double jet mixing process and a combination of them may be used. In the photographic emulsion layers of the photographic light sensitive materials used in the present invention, any of silver bromide, silver iodobromide, silver iodochlorabronide, silver chlorobromide and silver chloride may be used as the silver halide component. Formation of silver halide grains or physical ripening may be carried out in a presence of cadmium salts, zinc salts, lead salts, thallium salts, iridium salts or complex salts thereof, rhodium salts or complex salts thereof, or iron salts or complex salts thereof.

In these dyes, any nucleus conventionally used for cyanine dyes can be utilized as a basic heterocyclic nucleus. These sensitizing dyes may be used alone, or in combination. Combinations of such sensitizing dyes are frequently used, particularly for the purpose of supersensitization. The emulsions may contain dyes which do not have a spectral sensitization function themselves or substances which do not substantially absorb visible rays, but which dyes and substances show supersensitization together with the sensitizing dyes. As a binder or a protective colloid in the photographic emulsions, gelatin is preferably used, but other known hydrophilic colloids can also be used. The color light sensitive materials of the present invention have generally at least one red sensitive emulsion layer, at least one green sensitive emulsion layer and at least one blue sensitive emulsion layer on a base.The order of these layers applied is arbitrarily selected as occasion demands. Generally, the red sensitive emulsion layer contains a cyan coupler, the green sensitive emulsion layer contains a magenta coupler, and the blue sensitive emulsion layer contains a yellow coupler, and, if necessary, other combinations can be used. In the light sensitive materials used in the present invention, the hydrophilic colloid layers may also contain water soluble dyes as filter dyes or for other purposes such as the preventing irradiation. Typical examples of such dyes include oxonol dyes, hemioxonol dyes, styryl dyes, merocyanine dyes, cyanine dyes and azo dyes.Particularly preferred are oxonol dyes, hemioxonol dyes and merocyanine dyes.

The processing amount was 50 m2 of rolled paper.having a width of 8.25 cm per day, and the processing was repeated for 30 days. Further, wedge exposed Fuji color papers were developed at the intervals indicated in Table 1, and their photographic properties were compared. Results, that is, the changes with rapse of time in optical density, of each a blue sensitive layer B , a green sensitive layer G and a red sensitive layer R , obtained by processed with the processors A and B , are shown in Table 1.

The samples of the 30th day from processor A which had exhibited low red sensitivity and soft tone as the processing amount had increased, were measured again after they were immersed in a 20 solution of EDTA Fe III .NH4 pH 7.0 , and they were restored to the photographic properties of the first day. Accordingly, it was concluded that formation of the leuco form of the cyan dye inferior recovery of color occurred in the processing by the processor A , but it did not occur in the processing by the processor B . The yellow densities of the D rain portions of the wedge exposed light sensitive materials processed in processors A and B were again measured after samples exposed on the first day and samples exposed on the 30th day had been allowed to stand at 800C for 15 days.The samples processed in processor B using the method of the present invention were shown to be clearly superior to the samples processed in processor A . Remarkably, the processing performance attained after thirty days using the method of the present invention was nearly the same as that of the first day. z MPLE 2 Fuji color papers produced by Sllji Photo FilmCo. were exposed and processed in the.same manner as inExample 1, with the difference that the processing amount was 25 m2 of rolled paper having a width of 8.25 cm per day, and the processing was repeated for 60 days. Variations of photographic properties are shown in Table 2 in the same manner as in Example 1.

Once again, with increasing amounts of lightsensitive materials processed in processor A , red sensativity and soft tone decreased, and inferior recovery of color was experienced as in Example 1. However, in the processing by the processor B , it was not experienced.The samples of the first day and the 60th day were allowed to stand at 800C for 15 days. Variations of yellow density of the D rain portion of the exposed light sensitive material for both processed samples were measured, and the results are shown in Table 3.
