## Description
LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to laundry detergent compo sitions containing no or low levels of phosphate materials, which exhibit highly improved particulate scil removal capabilities. These detergent compositions provide surprisingly effective. clay soil removal performance even in the absence of detergency builders. Nonionic surfactants are generally used in laundry detergent compositions for their ability tD. remove greasy and oily soils. Cationic surfactan have also been used in detergent compositions, pri y to provide adjunct fabric care benefits, and not foL te purpose of cleaning. Cert ain cationic surfactants have been included in detergent compositions for the purpose, of yielding a germicidal or sanitization benefit to washed surfaces see, for example, U.S. Patent 2,742,434, Kopp, issued April 17, 1956 U.S. Patent 3,539,520, Cantor et al, issued November 10, 1970 and U.S. Patent 3,965,026, LanczY issued June 22, 1976.Other cationic surfactants, such as ditallowalkyldirethylammonium chloride, are included in detergent compositions for the purpose of yielding a fabricsoftening benefit, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,607,763,Salmen et al, issued September 21, 1971 and U.S. Paten 3,644,203, Lamberti et al, issued February 22, 1972. Such components are also used to control static, as well as soften laundered fabrics as, for example, in U.S. Patent 3,951,879, Wixon, issued April 20, 1976 and U.S. Patent3,959,157, Inamorato, issued May 25, 1976. All of the above patents being incorporated herein by reference.However, none of these patents indicate that by the careful selection and combination of certain nonionic and cationic surfactants, to achieve specific nonionic cationic surfactant ratios and reduced cationic monomer concentrations, outstanding removal of particulate soils may be obtained. The compositions of the present invention have outstanding cleaning capabilities. In laundry tests, these compositions, not containing any builder comconents, have been shown to remove clay soils at least as well, and in some cases dramatically better, than fully built conventional laundry detergent compositions. In addition, the compositions inhibit the transfer of dyes, soften and control static through the washing and drying operations.Further, by selecting the preferred cationic components defined in this application, the compo itions additionally provide biodegradability and excellent removal of greasy and oily soils, while also providing, in a single detergent product, particulate soil removal, fabric softening static control and dye transfer inhibition benefits to the laundered fabrics. The cleaning performance, which is superior to that previously demonstrated, is the result of a heretofore unrecognized cleaning potential of certain selected cationic surfactants when used in the presence of certain selected nonionic surfactants under the conditions specified herein. It is an object of this invention to provide, laundry detergent compositions which yield outstanding particulate soil removal, and which also provide fabric softening, static control and dye transfer inhibition benefits. It is another object of this invention to provide laundry detergent compositions, yielding excellent particulate soil removal, which may be used in a variety of physi cal forms, such as liquid, solid, paste, granular, powder, or in conjunction with a carrier such as a substrate. It is a further more specific object of this invention to provide specific detergent compositions which yield excellent particulate soil removal and which are biode gradable. It is a still further specific object of this invention to define specific novel cationic surfactants which are biodegradable and which yield excellent particulate and greasy and oily soil removal performance, as well as fabric softening and static control, in the cationic nonionic surfactant systems of the present invention. It is another specifics object of this invention to provide amide containing cationic nonionic surfactant containing compositions which yield both excellent particulate soil removal and anti redeposition properties. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a process for laundering fabrics which yields especially good particulate soil removal, using cationic and nonionic surfactant containing detergent compositions. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions, containing from 0 to about 20 phosphate materials, which are especially beneficial for the removal of particulate soils form fabrics, having a pH of at least about 6.5 in the aqueous launder solution, and which are substantially free of fatty acid polyglycol et diester compounds, oily hydrocarbon materials and cationic materials containing 13 or more ethylene oxide groups, comprising from about 5 to about 100 , by weight, of a surfactant mixture consisting essentially of a a biodegradable nonionic having the formula R OC2H4 nOIt wherein R is a primary or secondary alkyl chain of from 8 to about 22 carbon atoms and n is an aver age of from about 2 to about 12, having an HLB of from 5 to about 17 and b a cationic surfactant, free of hydrazinium groups, having the formula Rm1Rx2YL2 wherein each R1 is an organic group containing a straight or branched alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted with up to three phenyl or hydroxy groups and optionally interrupted by up to four structures selected from the group consisting ofEMI4.1 and mixtures thereof, said R1 containing from about 8 to 22 carbon atoms, and which may additionally contain up to 12 ethylene. oxide groups m is a number from 1 to 3, with no more than one R1 in a molecule having a total of 16 or more carbon atoms when m is 2, or more than 12 carbon atoms when m is 3 each R2 is an nlkyl or hydroxyalkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a benzyl group, with no ore than one R2 in a molecule being benzyl x is a number fror 0 to 11, the remainder of any carbon tom positions being filled by hydrogens Y is selected from the group consisting of EMI5.1 EMI5.2 wherein p is from 1 to 12, wherein each p is from 1 to 12,EMI5.3 9 mixtures thereof L is 1 or 2, the Y groups being separated by a moiety selected from R1 and R2 analogs having from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms and 2 free carbon single bonds when L is 2 Z is an anion in a number to give electrical neutrality to the molecule said cationic surfactant being at least water dispersible in admixture with said nonionic surfactant the ratio of said nonionic to said cat ionic surfactant b eing in the range of from 5 1 to about 1 1 and the said cationic surfactant being present in an amount less than 10 by weight of the composition. In preferred compositions, the reduced cationic monomer concentration of said surfactant mixture is from about 0.005 to about 0.2. The compositions of the present invention are formu.lated so as to have a pH of at least about 6.5 in the laundry solution at conventional usage concentrations in order to optimize overall cleaning performance preferably, they are alkaline in nature tpH greater than about 7j when placed in the laundry solution, and preferred compositions have a pH of at least about 7.5. Some of the cationic nonionic systems of the present invention will attain optimum removal of greasy oily soils at higher pHs, while attaining optimum clay removal at relatively lower pHs. In these systems, overall performance may be enhanced by varying the pH of the wash solution during the laundering process. Particula.ly preferred compositions have a pH of at least about 8 in the laundry solution, in order to imDrove the removal of bodv soil.In addition to the alkaline laundrv solution pH. these Dreferred comDositions should also have the ability to maintain a pH in the laundrv solution of from about 8 to 11 throughout the washing operation reserve alkalinitv . Such a reserve alkaliniLv mav be obtained bv incorooratina compounds which buy or at ns of from about S to 11. such as monoe,thanolamine. diothanolam ine or triethanolamire. The compositions are free of oily hydrocarbon materials, such as dry cleaning solvents mineral oil, paraffin oil and kerosene, because these materials which are themselves oily in nature load the washing liquor with excessive oily material, thereby diminishing the cleaning effectiveness of the compositions of the present invention The cationic component is free of hydrazinium groups due to their relatively high toxicity levcl which makes them unsuitable for use in the compositions of this invention The compositions of the present invention are substantially free of fa tty acid polyglycol ether diester compounds, such as polyethylene glycol 600 dioleate or polyethylene glycol 800 distearate.Such additives offer no advantage, and possibly even result in a disadvantage, in terms of achieving the particulate soil removal and fabric conditioning benefits provided by the present invention. Preferred compositions contain nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant ratios of from 5 1 to about 5 3, especially from about 10 3 to 10 5, and particularly about 10 4. Compositions may also contain mixed nonionic systems These mixed nonionic systems may contain nonionic surfactants which fall outside of the definition of the nonionic factant given above such as alcohol polyethoxylate an average of greater than 12 ethylene oxide groups molecule as long.as at least one of the nonionic c surf tants in the mixture falls within th2 required definition and the ratio of that nonionic surfactant to the cationi surfactant falls within the required nonionic cationlc surfactant ratio.Preferred compositions may also corts.in fatty anide surfactants, in addition to the cationic and nonionic components These amide containing compositions yield excellent particulate soil removal, as well as a particulaze soil anti redeposition hnefit. Processsec, laundering fabrics with the compositions of the present invention are also taught herein. The compositions of the present invention comprise, by weight, from about 5 to about 100 , particularly from about 10 to about 95 , and most preferably from about 20 to about 90 , of a mixture of the particularly defined nonionic and cationic surfactants in the ratios stated. It is preferred that the detergent compositions contain at least 1 of the cationic component otherwise, sufficient cat ionic surfactant may not be present in the wash solution to provide the desired cleaning results. Compositions containing 10 or more of the cationic component are not encompassed within the present invention. Such large amounts of cationic surfactant are impractical due to commercial availability and cost considerations. Nonionic Component The nonionic surfactants used in the compositions of the present invention are biodegradable and have the formula R OC2H4 nOH wherein R is a primary or secondary alkyl chain of from about 8 to about 22, preferably from about 10 to 18, carbon atoms and n is an average of from about 2 to about 12, preferably from about 2 to about 9, most preferably from about 2 to about 7, and especially from about 4 to about 7. The nonionic surfactants included within the present invention include branched alcohol ethoxylates. The nonionics have an HLB hydrophilic lipophilic balance of from about 5 to about 17, preferably from about 6 to about 14.Especially useful particulate soil removal can be obtained with nonionic surfactants having HLBs of from about 10 to about 13.5. These nonionic surfactants are preferably combined with less soluble cationic materials such as those having 2 or 3 long alkyl chains . Where more soluble cationic materials are used, nonionic surfactants of lowerHLB may be equally as beneficial. HLB is defined in detail in Nonionic Surfactants, by M.J.

A preferred class of such surfactants are made from substantially linear alcohols, such as those which utilize oxoalcohols containing about 20 2 methyl branched isomers, commercially avaiiasle under tlie tradename Neodol, from Shell Chemical Company.. The compositions of the present invention may also contain mixtures of nonionic surfactants falling within the above nonionic surfactant definition, or mixtures of non ionic surfactants, some of which do not fall within the above nonionic surfactant definition, as long as at least one of the non ionic surfactants contained in the mixture fails within the above definition of the nonionic surfactants, and the ratio of that nonionic surfactant to the cationic surfactant falls within the required nonionic cationic ratio.Where the nonionic surfactant mixture contains a nonionic surfactant or surfactants which falls outside of the above nonionic definition, the ratio of the surfactant or surfactants within the above definition to that which doors not fall within the definition is preferably within Ll12 range of from about 1 1 to about 5 1.

Z is a water soluble anion, such as a halide, sulfate, methylsulfate, hydroxide, or nitrate anion, particularly preferred being chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate or methyl sulfate anions, in a number to give electrical neutrality of the cationic com ponent.The specific cationic component to be included in a given system depends to a large extent upon the particular nonionic component to be included in the system, and is selected such that it is at least water dispersible, or preferably water soluble, when mixed with said nonionic surfactant. The term water dispersible means that the cationic and nonionic surfactants, as well as the anions discussed hereinafter, remain dispersed throughout the.laundry solution. during the washing process Mixtures of the above defined cationic materials may also be used in the compositions of the present invention. Small amounts of other cationic materials can be tolerated in such mixtures.

Particularly preferred compositions of this class include C12 alkyl trimeth ammonium halide, C14 alkyl trimethylammonium halide, coconutalkyl trimethylammonium halide, tallowalkyl tri methylammonium halide, .and C 16 halide. In order to be sufficiently water soluble or water dispersible, the cationic surfactant must satisfy the following chain length criteria. Where m is equal. to 2, only one of the R1 chains can be longer than 16 carbon atoms.

In addition to the advantages of the other cationi surfactants discloscd herein, this particular cationic component is environmentally desirable, since it 13 biodegradable, yielding environmentally acceptable compounds, both in terms of its long alkyl fragment and nitrogen containing fragment. Where this type of biodegradable cationic surfactant is used, it is preferred that the detergent compositions have a pH of not greater than about 11, preferably less than about 10, in the laundry solution, in order to minimize hydrolysis of the cationic surfactant. Particularly preferred cationic surfactants of this type are the choline ester derivatives having the following formula EMI22.1 as well, as those wherein the ester linkage in the above formula is replaced it a reverse, ester, amide or reverse amide linkage. Particularly preferred examples of this type of cationic surfactant include stearoyl choline ester quaternary ammonium halides R2 C17 alkyl , plamitoyl choline ester quaternary ammonium halides R2 C15 alkyl , myristoyl choline ester quaternary ammonium halides R2 C13 alkyl , lauroyl choline ester ammonium halides R2 C..alkyl , and tallowyl choline estor quaternary ammonium halides R2 C15 C17 alkyl . Additional preferred cationic components of the choline ester variety are given by the structural formulas below, wherein p may be from 0 to 20.EMI23.1 The preferred choline derivative cationic substances, discussed above, may b prepared by the direct esterification of a fatty acid of the desired chain length with diincthyl aminoethanol, in the presence of an acid catalyst,The reaction product is then quaternized with a methyl halide, forming the desired cationic material. The choline derived cationic materials may also be prepared by the direct esterification of a long chain fatty acid of L ne desired chain length together with 2 haloethanol, in te prsence of an acid catalyst material.The reaction product is this used to quaternize trimethylamine, forming the desired cationic component. Another type of novel, particularly preferred cat ionic material has the formula EMI24.1 In the formula, each R1 is a C1 to C4 alkyl or hydroxy alkyl group, preferably a methyl group. Each R2 is eith er hydrogen or C1 to C3 alkyl, preferably hydrogen is a C4 to C30 straight or branched chain alkyl, alkenyl, alkyl phenyl, or alkyl benzyl group, preferably a C8 to C18 alkyl group, most preferably a C12 alkyl group.

Z2 is selected from the group consisting of EMI24.2 selected from the group consisting of EMI24.3 ar. hercin at least one of said z1 and Z2 groups is selected from the group consisting of ester, reverse ester amide and reverse amide.X is an arion which will make the mpound at least water dispersible, and is seleoted from the group consisting of halides, mathyl sulfate, and nitr te, particularly chloride, bromi e, iodide, sulfate, sultabe ixtures of the above str es can also be use These surfactants, when used in the compositions of the present invention, yield excellent particulate soil, body soil, and grease and oil soil removal. In addition, the detergent compositions control static and soften the fabrics laundered therewith, and inhibit the transfer of certain dyes i the mashing solution.Further, these novel cationic surfactants are environmentally desirable, since both their long chain alkyl fragments and their nitrogen fragments are biodegradable, in that they degrade to yield environmentally acceptable compounds Where this type of biodegradabie cationic surfactant is used, it is preferred that the detergent compositions have a pH of not greater than about 11, preferably less than about 10, in the laundry solution, in order to minimize hydrolysis of the cationic, surfactant. Preferred embodiments of this typ of cationic component are the esters in which R1 is a methyl group and Z2 is an ester or reverse ester group, particular formulas of which are given below, in which t is O or l and y is from 1 to 20.EMI26.1 The preferred derivatives, described above, may be prepared by the reaction of a long chain alkyl polyalkoxy preferably polyethoxy carboxylate, having an alkyl chain of desired length, with oxalyl chloride, to form the corresponding acid chloride. The acid chloride is then reacted with dimethylaminoethanol to form the appropriate amine ester, which is then quaternized with a methyl halide to form the desired choline ester compound. Another way of preparing these compounds is by the direct esterification of the appropriate long chain ethoxylated carboxylic acid together with 2 haloethanol or dimethyl aminoethanol, in the presence of heat and an acid catalyst.The reaction product formed is then quaternized with methylhalide or used to quaternize trimethylamine to form the desired choline ester compound. As a guide in formulating compositions which deliver excellent particulate soil removal, the reduced cationic monomer concentration may be used. Thus, the nonionic and eationic components, def ined above, may be combined into a surfactant mixture which has a ratio corresponding to a reduced cationic monomer concentration CR of from about 0.005 to about 0.2, preferably from about 0.008 to about 0.15, particularly from about 0.01 to about 0.1. A CR value within this range will yield.a composition which exhibits optimum particulate soil remov al,performance. Where the nonionic and cationic components used are pure, the more narrow CR ranges are preferred.In a preferred method of preparing the compositions of the present invention the nonionic and cationic surfactants are intimately and com pletelv mixed together prior to the addition of anv additional components to the mixture. This intimate premixing of the nonionic and cationic components enhances performance of the compositions. An approximation of the CR of a surfactant mixture is obtained by dividing the concentration of the cat ionic surfactant monomer in the laundry solution by the critical micelle concentration CMC of the sufactant. As used in this application, CMC s are determined at 105 F in water containing 7 grains gallon of mixed hardness, unless otherwise stated. For purposs 0 t this application, CR is calculated according to the equations gi below. The concept of reduced monomer concentration is derived from the discussion in Tamamushi and Tamaki, Proceedings of the Second International Congress of Surface Activity, III, 449, Academic Press, Inc 1957 and in Clint, J. Chem. Soc.Far. Trans., I,71, 1327 1975 , incorporated herein by reference, in the context of an ideal solution, and is based on the following quadratic equation equation 11 in Clint EMI28.1 wherein in the above and the following equations C total analytical surfactant concentra tion in the solution moles l. sum of the cationic and nonionic concentrations C1 C2 wherein l denotes nonionic surfactant and 2 denotes cationic surfactant c1 critical micelle concentration CMC of nonionic surfactant moles l.

This procedure sas repeated for a large nunber qf such tests, over varying usage conditions. The x values obtained were then used to solve For the cationic monomer concentrations using the following equation cm 1 x f2c2 2 The CR value was then calculated using equation 3 . CR cxm c2 3 The CR values obtained cover a large number of conbina tions and ratios of various nonionic and cationic surfactants, at various concentrations and temperatures, which have been evaluated for their ability to clcan greasy olly soils The examination of the resulting data revealed that for a given system the optimum cleaning of greasy oily soils was found at a CR value of from about 0.002 to about 0.2 This range of CR i.e., 0.002 to 0.2 can then be used to determine the range of optimum nonionic cationic r.arics for any given combination of nonionic surfactant and cationic surfactant, for the desired wash concentration within the overall wash concentration range of from 100 parts per million ppm to 10,000 ppm of surfactant. This talculation is carried out in the following manner, where ss, CR, c1 , c2 , M1 and M2 are known for a given nonionic cationic surfactant pair R for a given nonionic surfactant, cationic sur factant, and for each end of the CR range, solve for x using the equation 2 1 x e x CR by standard numerical itera tive techniques to an error in x of less than 01001 find find the range of Y from the equationEMI30.1 using 100 ppm and 10,000 ppm as the boundary values for w, for each end of the CR range c the nonionic cationic ratlo NCR range for optimum performance is then within tho range obtained by substituting the boundary values for Y into the formula NCR Y 1 Y Put another way, steps b and c may be combined into a single equation which may be solved directly for the NCR.EMI31.1 The above procedure is relevant only to wa solution concentrations above the critical micelle concentration of the nonionic cationic mixture For concentrations which, are as high as about five times the critical micelle concentration, CR is essentis y independent of concentration.This means that for conventional laundry usage concentrations e.g., 100 ppm to 10,000 ppm, and especially from about 250 ppm. to about 3,000 ppm , the CR of most commercial cationic nonionic surfactant mixtures wherein the cationic component has a CMC of less than about 100 ppm, measured at 1050F water containing 7 grain gallon of mixed calcium and magnesium hardness will be independent of the actual usage concentration, so that using a concen tration of about 1,000 pptn in the above calculation wi.ll be a satisfactory approximation for the entire range. As used herein, if a concentration range i a specified, the 1,000 ppm CR is meant. In addition to these reduced cationic monomer criteria, the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture may also satisfy the specific cloud point requirements, given below. In addition to outstanding particulate soil detergency, these preferred compositions will be optimized for the removal of grcasy oily soils.Thus, in preferred compositions, the cloud point of the nonionic cationic mixture and in preferred embodiments the nonionic cationic mixture plus any electrolytes present in the composition falls between about 0 and about 950C, preferably between about 10 and about 7qOc, more preferably between about 20 and about 70 OC, especially between about 30 and about 500,C For cold water deteryency, the surfactant mixture should have a cloud point between about 0 and about 250C. The fact that a composition has a cloud point within these temperature ranges assures that the composition can be utilized under laundry temperature conditions to achieve outstanding removal of greasy oily soils.If a composition does not have a cloud point within the Demperature range specified, it will not yield outstanding greasy oily soil cleaning within that temperature range. The compositions will exhibit their best grease oil removal performance when the temperature of the wash solution in which they are used falls within about 200C, preferably within about 150C, and most preferably.within about 100C, of the cloud point of the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture.Put another way, the laundry solution temperature range in which the preferred compositions deliver optimum grease oil removal lies between the cloud point temper ature of the system in the absence of.the cationic component, and about 300C, preferably about 250C, most preferably about 200C, above that cloud point temperature. As used herein, the term cloud point means the temperature at which a graph which plots the light scattering intensity of the composition versus wash solution temperature begins to sharply increase to its maximum value, under the following experimental conditions The light scattering intensity is measured using a Model VM 12397 Photogoniodiffusometer, manufactured bySociety Francaise d instruments de control et d analyses,France the instrument being hereinafter referred to as SOFICA . The SOFICA sample cell and its lid arse washed with hot acetone and allowed to dry. The surfactant mixture is made and put into solution with distilled water at a concentration of 1000 ppm.Approximately a 15 ml. smaple of the solution is placed into the sample cell, using a syringe with a 0.2 nucleopore filter. The syringe needle passes through the sample cell lid, so that the cell interior is not exposed to atomospheric dust. The sample is kept in a variable temperature bat, and both the bath and the sample are subject to constant stirring. The bath temperature is heated using the SOFICA s heater and cooled by the addition of ice heating rate 1OC minute the temperature of the sample is determined by the temperature of the bath.The light scattering intensity of the sample is then determined at various temperatures, using a green filter and no polarizer in the SOFICA. Fatty Amide Component In particular preferred embodiments of the present invention the nonionic sufactant cationic surfactant mixture additionally contains from about 2 to about 25 , preferably from about.2 to about 16 , and most preferably from about 3 to about 10 , of a fatty amide surfactant.The ratio of the total cationic and nonionic components to the amide component in the composition is in the range of from 5 1 to about 50 1, pre from about 8 1 to 25 1. hen these compositions are formulated in accordance with the ratio and the preferred reduced cat ionic monomer concentration limits given herein3 they result in excellent particulate soil removal performance, as well as improved soil antiredeposition characteristics. Amides useful in these preferred compositions include, jut are not limited to, carboxylic acid amides, sulfonic acid amides, phosphonic acid amides, and boronic acid ainides. Preferred amides include those having the formulae EMI34.1 rain R1 is a C8 C20 alkyl, alkenyl, alkyl phenyl or alkyl zyl group, preferably C10 C18 alkyl, and most preferably and each R2 is hvdrogen. or C1 C8 alkyl or 1 8 droxyalkyl, preferably hydrogen.Specific examples of ese compositions include a mixture of stearoyl choline omide present in the washing solution at 120 parts per , t e condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 of thylene oxide present in the wash solution at out 357 parts per million , and a mid cut coconut alkyl moni amide R1 coconut alkyl and R2 is hydrogen present the wash solution at about 50 parts par million and a xture of stearoyl choline bromide 100 ppm the con ation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethyl e oxide 357 ppm , and lauramide R1 C11 and R2 is hydrogen aL 45 ppr Additional ComponentsWhAle the compositions of the present invention may contain additive materials conventionally used in detergent compositions, the amount of anion producing materials, and hence anions, which will make the particular cationic surfactant used in the compositions non water dispersible should be minimized. Whether a particular anion constitutes an interfering anion depends upon the physical and chemical properties such as structure and dissociation constant of the particular anions and cationic surfactants used in a given composition.It is preferred that anionic materials be contained in amounts sufficiently small such that tut more than about 10 molar percent, preferably not rre han about 5 molar percent, of the cationic surfactant tained in the laundry solution, is complexed by the anionis material Such a complexing of the anionic material with the ca tonic surfactant decreases the overall cleaning and fabric con ditioning performance of the composition. Suitable anionic materials may be selected based . their strength of completion with the cationic material included in the composition as indicated by their dissoci ation constant . Thus, when an anionic material huts d dissociation constant of at least about lox10 3 such as sodium toluene sulfonate , it may be contained in an amount up to about 40 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant where the anionic material has a dissociation constant oE at least about 1x10 , but less than about.lxl0 , it may be contained in an amount up to about 15 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant and where the anionic material has a dissociation constant of less than about 1x10 5, such as sodium Cll 8 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate , it should be contained only in amounts up to about 10 , by weight, of the cationic surfactant. It is preferred, in order to minimize the effects of interfering anions, that the compositions of the present invention be substantially free of phosphate, polyphosphate, silicate, and polycarboxylate builder anions, carboxymethyl I cellulose, and anionic surfactants particularly preferred are those which are substantially free of phosphate, polyphosphate, and carboxymethyl cellulose materials. The compositions of the present invention contain from 0 to about 20 of phosphate materials and, even though they contain no or low levels of phosphate materials, exhibit an outstanding level of particulate soil removal. It is preferred that the compositions be substantially free of phosphate materials both for performance and environmental reasons. The compositions of the present invention may also contain additional ingredients generally found in laundry detergent compositions, consistent with the restrictions on interfering anions, stated above, at their conventional artestablished levels. Very low levels i.e., from about 1 to about 15Z of electrolytes, such as perborates, phosphates, polyphosphonates, carbonates or sulfates, may.have a beneficial effect on cleaning performance. The compositions of the present invention may contain up to about 15, w preferably up to about 5 , and most pre ferably from about .1 to 2 , of a suds suppressor component. Typical suds suppressors include long chain ratty acids, such as those described in U.S. Patent 2,354,347, issueSeptember 27, 1960, St. John, and combinations of certais nonionics therewith, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,954,346., issued September 2.7, 1960, Schwoeppe, both disclosures being incorporated herein by reference. Other suds suppressor components useful in compositions of the present inven tion include, but are not limited to, those described below. Preferred suds suppressing additives are described inU.S. Patent 3,933,672, issued January 20, 1976, Bartolotta et al., incqrporated herein by reference, relative to a silicone suds controlling Patent. The silicone material can be represented by alkylated polysiloxane materials such as silica aerogels and xerogels and hydrophobic silicas of various types.The silicone material can be described as a siloxane having the formula EMI38.1 wherein x is from about 20 to about 2,000, and R andR are each alkyl or aryl groups, especially methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and phenyl. The polydimethylsiloxanes R and R are methyl having a molecular weigh witliiii tIIe range or from about 200 to about 200,000, and higher, are all useful as suds controlling agents. Additional suitable silicone materials wherein the side chain groups R, and R are alkyl, aryl, or mixed alkyl and aryl hydrocarbyl groups exchibit useful suds controlling properties. Examples of the like ingredients include diethyl , dipropyl , dibutyl , methyl ethyl , phenylmethyl polysiloxanes and the like.Additonal useful silicone suds controlling agents can be represented by a mixture of an alkylated siloxane, as referred to hereinbcfore, and solid silica. Such mixtures are prepared by affixing the silicone to the surface of the solid silica. A preferred silicone suds controlling agent is represented by a hydrophobic silanated most preferably trimethylsilanted silica having a particle size in the range from about 10,millimicrohs to 20 millimicrons and a specific surface are above about 50 m2 gm. intimately admixed with dimethyl silicone fluid having a molecular eight in the range from about 500 to about 200,000 at a weight ratio of silicone to silanated silica of from about 19 1 to about 1 2.The silicone suds suppressing agent is advantageously releasably incorporated in a water soluble or water dispersible, substantially non surface active detergent impermeable carrier. Particularly useful suds suppressors are the selfemulsifying silicone sucls suppressors, such as DB 544, commercially available from Dow Corning, which contains a siloxane glycol copolymer together.with solid silica and a siloxane resin. Microcrystalline waxes having a melting point in the range from 35 C 115 C and a saponification value of less than 100 represent additional examples of a preferred suds regulating component for use in the subject compositions, such waxes are described in U.S. Patent 4,056,481, Tate, issued November 1, 1977, incorporated herein by reference.The microcrystalline waxes are substantially water insoluble, but are water dispersible in the presence of organic sufactants. Preferred microcrystalline waxes have a melting point from about 650C to 1000C, a molecular weight in the range from, 400 1,000 and a penetration value of at least 6, measured at 7.70F by ASTM D1321. Suitable examples of the above waxes include microcrystalline and oxidized microcrystalline petrolatum waxes Fischer Tropsch and oxidized Fisher Tropsch waxes ozokerite ceresin montan wax beeswax candelilla and carnauba wax. Alkyl phosphate esters represent an additional preferred suds suppressant for use herein. These preferred phosphate estersw are predominantly monostearyl phosphate which, in addition thereto, can contain di Bnd tristearyl phosphates and monooleyl phosphates, which can contain diand trioleyl phosphates. The alkyl phosphate esters frequently contain some trialkyl phosphatc. Accordingly, a preferred phosphate ester can contain, in addition to the monoalkyl ester, e.g., monostearyl phosphate, up to about 50 mole percent of dialkyl phosphate and up to about 5 mole percent of trialkyl pho sph ate Other compatible adjunct components which may be included in the compositions of the present invention, in their conventional arL established levels of use, include bleaching agents, bleach activators, soil suspnding agents, corrosion inhibitors, dyes, fillers, optical brighteners, germicides, p I adjusting agents, enzymes, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, fabric softening components, static control agents, and the like.However, because of the numerous and diverse performance advantages of the compositions the present invention, many components, such as static control agents, fabric softening agents and germicides, will not usually be necessary. The compositions of the present invention he be manufactured and used in a variety of physical ns, such as solid, powder, granular, paste, or liquid. The compositions are particularly well suited corporation into substrate articles for use in the home laundering process. These articles consist of a water insoluble substrate which releasably incorporates an effective amount, preferably iron about 3 to 120 grams, particularly from about 20 to 30 grams, of the detergent compositions of Lhe present invention. A particularly preferred substrate article incorporates a bleaching component and a bleach activator on the substrate, together with the nonionic cationic surfactant mixture. In a particularly preferred method of making the detergent compositions of the present invention, the specif ically defined non.iollicand cationic surfactants are intimately and completely mixed at a temperature of from about 250C to about 95 CC, preferably from about 400C to about 90 C, prior to the addition of any additional components. By using this process, the components are taken from their original liquid or powder form and are made into a thick paste, which is ideally suited for use in the substrate articles, described above. When this process is used to make the compositions of the present invention, the components are present in non ionic cationic ratios of from 5 1 to about 1 1, preferably from 5 1 to about 5 3, and more preferably from about 10 3 to about 10 5, and are formed into mixtures which satisfy the reduced cationic monomer concentration requirements, herein. In one particularly preferred embodiment of this process, the components are intimately mixed together at a temperature of about 25 C. In this embodiment, it is pre f.erred that the anion contained in the cationic surfactant be bromide.Thus, when stearyl choline bromide, a powder having the following formula,EMI41.1 is intimately mixed at a temperature of about 250C with the condensation product of C12 alcohol ith 5 moles of ethylene oxide, a liquid, at a nonionic cationic ratio of about 10 4, a thick paste product is formed. Substantially similar results are obtained when the nonionic surfactant is the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide. In another particularly preferred embodiment of this process, the components are intimately mixed together at a temperature of at least about 65 C. In this embodiment, it is preferred that the anion contained in the cationic surfactant be chloride.Thus, when stearoyl choline chloride, a powder, is intimately mixed at a temperature of about 800C with the condensation product of C12 alcohol with 5 moles Df ethylene oxide, a liquid, at a nonionic cationic fa o of about 10 4, a thick paste product is formed. ne same components are mixed together at about UC, the mixture remains a liquid, which is much less desirable for use in making substrate articles.Substantially similar results are obtained when the onionic surfactant is the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide. The compositions of the present invention are used in the laundering process by forming an aqueous solution preferably one having a temperature of from about lo to about 500C . containing from about 0.01 100 parts per million to 0.3 3,000 ppm , preferably from about 0. 02 to 0.2 , and ,most preferably from about 0.03 to about 0.15 , of the nonionic c,ationic detergent mixture, and agitating the soiled fabrics in that solutionThe fabrics are then rinsed and dried.When used in this manner, the compositions of the present invention yield exceptionally good particulate soil removal performance.Further, the compositions also provide fabric softening static control, and dye transfer inhibition benefits to the fabrics laundered therewith. Although not intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the clay removal mechanism is as follows. At the optimum nonionic cationic ratio,, as defined by the reduced cationic monomer concentration, the cationic.sur factant adsorbs onto the clay soil negatively charged in a mono layer, neutralizing the charge. This neutralized charge results in a hydrophobic surface which increases the adsorption of the nonionic surfactant onto the clay surface.The clay soil is then easily removed by the agitation. It has been found that when the nonionic caticnlc compositions of the present invention are used in a laundry solution, a threshhold concentration of at least about 50, preferably about 100, most preferably about 150, parts per million on the cationic coMponent must be present in the laundry solution in order to give the particulate soil removal benefit. Under conventional United States laundry conditions, which generally utilize from about 150 to 1500 parts per million of a detergent composition in the laundry solution, nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant ratios of from 5 1 to about 1 1 are necessary in order to provide this threshhold concentration in the laundry solution, All percentages, parts, and ratios used herein a by weight unless otherwise specific. The following nonlimiting examples illustrate the compositions and the method of the present invention.

Substantially similar results are also obtained when the ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant used in the above composition is 10 3, 20 7, 10 5, 20 11, 5 3, 5 t, or 1 1. Similar results are also obtained where the catione surfactant, used above, is replaced by one of the following surfactants EMI49.1 EXAMPLE III A detergent composition of the present invention was formulated by combining the condensati.on p odust of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide HLB 10.5 together with one of the prefe ati sufactants of the present ention hav EMI50.1 in a ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant of about 10 4 CRg0 07l This detergent composition had a pII in the washs olution of about 8.5, and was used in the washing solution at a concentration of about 500 ppm. A second detergent composition of the present invention was formulated by combining the same non ionic and cationic surfactants in the same ratio as above.The composition also contained monoethanolamine as an alkalinity source, in an amount such that the monoethanolamine was present at about 30 ppm in the washing solution when the entire composition was used at a concentration of about 530 ppm. The pH of the second detergent composition in the laundry solution was about 9.3. Identical polyester cotton blend swatches were stained with a mixture of soil collected from air conditioning filters and a mineral oil olive oil oleic acid blend. The stained swatches were then washed using each of the above two detergent compositions in a one gallon washing machine which simulates the action of a commercial washing machine. The washing operation was carried out for 10 minutes using water having a temperature of about 1000F 380C and containing 7 grains per gallon of mixed calcium and magnesium hardness. The soil removal performance was calculated by using the weight removal percentage, averaged across the three stained swatches washed in eacll composition. Both compositions gave excellent soil removal performance. IXoxlever, the cationic nonionic mixture containing monoethanolamine and having the higher, alkalinity had a soil removal of about 73 , while the lower pll cationiC nonionic mixture had a soil removal of about 50 .These data demonstrate that improved soil removal performance is obtained by the use of cationic nonionic detergent compositions having a higher alkalinity such as that obtained by the inclusion of monoetWarlolamine. Substantially similar results are obtained when other sources of alkalinity, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, triethanolamine, and sodium silicate, are used, in comparable amounts, in place of or in combination with the monoethanolamine. Similar results are also obtained where the nonionic component used above is replaced by the condensation product of C10 alcohol with 3 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 6 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of C12 13 alcohol with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide, the condensation product of C14 15 alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide, or the condensation product of C12 13 alcohol with 3 moles of ethylene oxide stripped so. as to remove the lower ethoxylate and unethoxyla ted fractions. Excellent cleaning results are also obtained where the detergent compositions used contain nonionic to cationic surfactant ratios of about 5 1, 4 1, 10 3, 20 7, 20 9, 2 1, 5 3, or 1 1.

Substantially similar cleaning results are also obtained where the cationie component is replaced by Cp2 alkyl trimethylammonium chloride, C14 alkyl trimethylammonium bromide, di C10 alkyl dimethyl ammonium bromide, di C12 alkyl dimethylammonium chloride, tri C8 alkyl methylammonium bromide, triC10 alkyl methylammonium chloride or cationic components having the formulae given below EMI52.2 EMI53.1 EXAMPLE IV A detergent composition of the present invention was formulated by combining the condensation product of coconut alcohol with 5 moles of ethylene oxide together with the cat ionic surfactant having the formula EMI53.2 such that the ratio of nonionic surfactant to cationic surfactant was about 10 4.The detergent composition was used in the laundry solution at a concentration of about 500 ppm. A second .detergent composition of the present invention was formulated so as to contain the same non ionic and cationic components in the same ratio, but which additionally contained a C12 16 alkyl fatty acid ammonia amide, present in an amount such that the amide component would be present in the washing solution at a concentration of 50.ppm when the composition was used at a concentration of 500 ppm.This composition.had a pH in the laundry solution of about 8.4. Sine swathes 3 cotton, 3 polyester, and in water suspension and Where washed in a one gallon washing machine which simulates the action of a commercial washing machine, using each of the above two detergent compositions. Two 11 x 11 100 cotten terry cloths, with loop construction, were added to each washing machine as redeposition sites for the scil removed from the stained swatches. The washing process was carried out for 10 minutes in water of about 1000F 38 C , containing 6.5 grains per gallon of mixed calcium and magnesium hardness.After washing the cloths in the respective test treatments and subsequently drying them, the reflectance of the perry cloths were read using a Hunter Ref lectometer. cleaning performance of both detergent compo tons on the stained swatches was excellent. In ado Lion, the first composition, containing only the nonionic and cationic components, yielded terry cloths having a reflectance of 53 Hunter WhitenessUnits, while the second composition, which additionally or1tainCd the amide component, yielded terry cloths having a reflectance of 71 Hunter Whiteness Units. These ata demonstrate the improved soil antiredepo tion properties which are obtained by the inclusion of an amide component in the cationic nonionic detergent compositions of the present invention. Substantially similar results are obtained e the amide component is present in such an amount such tat the concentration of amide in the washing than is about 80 ppm, 75 ppm, 65 ppm, 55 ppm, ppm9 or 30 ppm.Similar results are also obtained where the amide component used above is replace by amides having the formula EMI55.1 wherein R1 is C8 alkyl, C10 alkyl, C2 2 alkyl, C13 alkyl, C15 alkyl or C17 alkyl, and R is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, or hydroxymethyl.
