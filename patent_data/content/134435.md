## Description
A PROCESS FOR THE RECOVERY OF VALUABLE METALSFROM THE ASHES OF NORMAL AND COMPLEX PYRITES This invention relates to the recovery of the valuable metals copper, silver, gold, zinc and other, all contained in the ashes of polymetallic sulfide containing massive ores in general, as well as ashes from residues of the sulfating ignition and the residues produced by the natural change of said sulfides, by means of a not integral and of low cost process. Without any limitation, and only for the aake of brevity, in this invention reference will be made to the words ashes of normal and complex pyrites to indicate the starting material. The integral processes, generally of the pyrometallurgi type, mainly fooussed on covery of the iron oxides, have encountered many difficulties, due to the high costs and to the requirements of the iron and steel industry, both concerning the quality of the iron oxide. and the prices. On the other hand, the rise and the maintenance of the prices of metals such as gold, sil ver, copper, etc., have made interesting the idea of a process which allows the extraction of these metals at a low T rroduction cost without the necessity of the recovery of the iron oxides. Therefore such a low cost, not integral process constitutes the object of the present invention. A survey of the patent bibliography and of the hydrometallurgic researches in the field of the ashes of pyrites, shows a great difference and anomalies in the results. It was proved that these anomalies are due to the ignorance of the phases containing the valuable metals and of its suitable means of release. For reagents such as chlorine or hypochlorites, etc., already proposed since the last century, these could not be the base for any hydrometallurgic process useful or of low cost. In the case of the ashes of normal or complex pyrites, it is necessary to grind 0 and crush them to a size less than 90 micrometers and at least 50 by weight of the solids must be below 25 micrometers, otherwise these reagents are not able to extract the valuable metals in a proportion which can be profitable. A suitable size distribution, acccrding to the concepts of the above paragraph, for the ashes of pyrites, is presented in the following table TA3D I Size in m of residue partial global 90 0 0 63 21 21 40 11 32 25 17 49 less 25 51 51 Due to the crumbly character of the ashes, these size requirements are obtainable without difficulty and at a low cost. Once the ashes of pyrites are properly ground, a slurry is prepared for example 1 2, one part solids for two parts liquid , and treated at room temperature with chlorine or hypochlorites, and with the above mentioned size distribution the reagent is truly efficient. Therefore, in addition to its ability known for leaching gold, which is the only reason for its use as a reagent in other cases, here it is in fact suggested for other not leas interesting reactions, which are dissolution of the sulfide containing phasesEMI4.1 dissolution of the oxides of the valuable me tals through the acidity produced in the re action 1 EMI4.2 complexation reactions which support the leach ing starting from the chlorides produced in the reaction 1 EMI4.3 and the known reaction of dissolution of the noble metalsEMI4.4 The iron oxides and the ferrites or the pseudoferrites do not dissolve in this leaching agent at room temperature. All these reactions, which are effective only when the ashes are well liberated with a proper grinding, are those which allow a high peSces 4 Xe of dissolution of the valuable metals, such as gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead, etc., while there is practically no dissolution of the iron oxides, which in other processes, acidic oxidizing, and especial ly at high temperatures, dissolve in substantial quantities rendering little reliable and difficult the recovery of the valuable metals from the solutions, whereas according to the process of the invention said recovery is substantially cheap. The process according to the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawing, which represents the flow chart of the operative steps of said process. The first step comprises the grinding 1 of the ashes of the pyrites 2 in order to obtain the proper size distribution. In the case the ashes of pyrites contain a high percentage of su phur, as in the case of the ashes resulting from the firing in stage ovens , according to the invention it is proposed, in order to reduce to a minimum the chlorine consumption, that before said grinding 1 a screening and a reject 3 will be made of the coarser fractions of the ashes, which are about 3 mm, that have a high content of sulphur, and this entails the rejection of a percentage by weight very low in comparison with the total weight of the ashes and consequently through a simple screening it is possible to desulphurize the charge to about 40 , before the grinding step 1 . In addition to this foregoing screening, for the ashes of stage ovens rich in iron sulphide not fully fired, it is proposed to further treat said ashes already ground in a rod mill 3 .As a result of the higher r1aQticity of the residual iron sulphide, they are laminated in this step and form large shapes which can be separated in a further screening, obtaining as a consequence a desulphurization still more complete, after which the grinding step is carried out 1 as far as the size distribution given in TABLE 1. Secondly, with the ashes duly reduced as said, a slurry is prepared in 4 with water or, better than with water, with the liquids of recycling and washing 5 , slurry which is treated with the leaching agent 6 , that can be chlorine or hypochlorites, etc., as described. Thirdly, accomplished the described reactions, the slurry goes to a separation step 7 of the ashes treated with the liquids containing the valuable metale. These liquids 8 go on to an elimination and separation step of the impurities 9 , while the treated ashes proceed to a washing step 10 with water or better with a recycling liquid 11 , in order to recover the valuable metals contained in the liquid aoaking the sliirry of the treated ashes. This washing water of the treated ashes, returns 5 to the reactor 4 in order to form fresh slurry with other fresh ashes. The slurry of the treated ashes after the washing forms a residue 12 which in the soaking liquid involves a loss of not even 28g of the leached valuable metals. This residue is a non polluting residue and being impregnated witn chlorides it can be useful for further processes. According to reaction 1 , the liquids of the reactor 4 attain an acidic pH, similarly if hypochlorites are used, there is also an acidity produced, but this is lower. Fourthly, the liquids 8 containing the valuable metals proceed to the step of elimination and separation of the impurities 9 . In this step 9 , said elimination can be done with the addition of basic substances 13 , such as oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, etc. of alkaline or alcaline eaFth.metals, or of other metals, such at oxide, hydroxide or carbonate, etc. In this invention for reasons of low cost it is proposed the use of calcium oxide or carbonate, although the use of recycled zinc hydroxide 13 produces economical solutions very interesting, since this zinc hydrowide is produced in the present process. In this step of elimination and separation of the impurities 9 , the calcium carbonate or the calcium oxide neutralizes firstly the acid produced by the liquids and thereafter with the increase of the pH till 2,5 3, precipitates 14 the small quantities of the iron in solution, precipitation which causes the entrainment practically complete of the arsenic. The reactions are the following EMI8.1 The evolution of carbon dioxide, reaction 6 , eiiminates by entrainment the last traces of chlorine and produces the precipitation of a fraction of the lead as chloride, all of which represents in a simple operation at room tamperature, a very good elimination of iron, arsenic, other impurities and the last traces of chlorine, that would negatively interfer with the yield of the following operations. This fourth step, which has Juat been described, although useful, can be omitted in those cases in which the liquids 8 coming from the separation solid liquid 7 go directly to the cementation step 15 . The fifth step comprises the cementation 15 of the liquids whether purified or not 8 .In the case in which it is followed the route of the purification 9 of the liquids 8 , the pH of the solutions is 2,5 to 3, and at this point it is possible to proceed or not to a small addition of hydrochloric acid to reduce the pH to 2. This route has the object of producing a shell of valuable metals of the best quality 22 . The cementation can be carried out with iron, zinc, lead, etc. 16 .It is also possible optionally to carry out a frac tional cementation, in such a way as to cement with impure recycled shell, that is take the impure shell from the cementation of the final stage and add it to the first cemkntation tank where the liquids charged with valuable metals enter, wherefore the metals starting to cement in this first tank give a shell having the highest quality and a high yield in noble metals. In the following cementation tans he liquids cemented with iron, eino or lead, etc., are exhausted. In the cementation with iron of purified liquids and with a pli of 2,5 to 3, there is a consumption of about 0,62 kgsof iron for every 100 kgS of ashes, and in the optional modification of cementation of liquids without elimination of the impurities, the consumption is of 1,26 kgsof iron for every 100 kgsof ashes. The quantity of recovered copper, silver and gold is 80 for each metal and relative to the contents of these metals in the starting ashes. The liquids at the exit from the cementation, practically devoid of valuable metals, can be discarded, but for a maximum economy of the process it is proposed a sixth and last step. In this step 17 washing liquid 182 and a base 18 are added to the liquids, preferably starting with calcium carbonate and ending with the addition of a baise such as calcium oxide which is somewhat cheaper.In this way it is obtained the precipitation 19 of the zinc hydroxides and the iron hydroxide solubilized in the cementation, as well as the last fractions of lead and the other impurities, etc., according toEMI11.1 After the separation of this precipitate, which gives a washed cake very rich in zinc, it is useful to proceed to its exploitation, for instance adding sulphuric acid 20 and preparing crystallized zinc sulphate 21 . The liquids its from this last separation devoid of heavy metals and containing calcium chloride in case the neutralization and precipitation have been made with CO3Ca and CaO , are recycled as washing waters to the step of washing and separation 10 of the treated ashes, by which is obtained a saving of about 90 of the water used in the overall process. Since it is carried out a treatment of the ashes with chlorine and immediately the liquids are precipitated with CO 3Ca and CaO, the liquids are continuously enriched with calcium chloride.The method by which this calcium chloride, continuously produced, is extracted, is the following.The slurry of treated ashes exiting from the last apparetus of washing and separation, exits with a content of liquid.It is remembered that this residual slurry contains about 36 litres of liquids for each 100 kgsof treated ashes. As a consequence, if the concentration of calcium chloride in the liquids is about 200 g litre, the quantity of calcium chloride going in said 36 litres is approximately equal to the quantity of calcium chloride produced. If for any reason with the residual slurry should be eliminated a smaller quantity of liquid, the ooncentration of the calcium chloride in the process liquids will be reduced, untill with the new volume, smaller, of solution accompanying the residual slurry, the quantity of calcium chloride eliminated will be equal to that produced On the contrary, if the slgrry exits with more liquid, then it will eliminate more calcium chloride and the concentration of the calcium chloride in the liquids will be reduced, but as now more liquids will be eliminated with the residual slurry, the result will bring to eliminate as much calcium chloride as is produced.After all, this feature of the suggested process, allows the autoregulation of the calcium chloride in the recycled solutions and the system is automatically stabilized, provided there is any hypotetic cause separating it temporarily from a working concentration. In the following, in order to faclslXate the complete description of the process according to the invention, the following example will be given, which is intended by no means as a limitation but rather as an illustration of the process, and therefore within the scope of the present invention can be made all those variations which do not harm, alter, change or modify the essence of the described process. The starting materials are 100 kgsof ashes, with the typical following composition TABIM II Element Iron 57,5 Sulphur total 1,2 Copper 0,9 Zinc 2,8 Bead 1,3 Arsenic 0,52 Silver 0,0045 Gold 0,00014 After a proper grinding, as descibed see Table I , a slurry is prepared in the reactor with one part of ashes and two parts of recycled and washing liquid, after which five kgfof chlorine are inJoctod. After completion of the reactions described, which take from 1 to 2 hours, the slurry is eent to the following step of separation solid liquid.The weights of valuable metals and of the other leached metals for 100 kgs of ashes, are TA3 III Element Weight Extracted Iron 0,40 kgs 0,70 Copper 0,74 kgs 82 Zinc 1,30 kgs 46 Bead 1,00 kg 80 Arsenic 0,28 kgs 54 Silver 3,7 grs 82 Gold 0,11 grs 79 The slurry of this first separation 80 lid liquid contains a substantial quantity of liquid 30 litres for 100 kgs of treated ashes , in which valuable metals are dissolved, and therefore this slurry must be washed and re washed. Tha washing waters used are lyes of calcium chloride containing about 200 grs Cl2Ca litre, which are recycled and1 after the washing, the liquids with the recovered valuable metals go back to the reactor in order to produce the subsequent slurry with fresh ashes. The final slurry of the last washing and separation step exit. soaked with a solution of calcium chloride containing less than 2 of the dissolved valuable metals. The liquids with the valuable metals, go to a step of Elimination and separation of impu rites which is optional, since the process can also go to completion without it . In this step of elimination of the impurities, the liquids are subjected to a neutralization and precipitation with calcium carbonate.The liquids enter in this step ad a pH of about 0,3 and the consumption of calcium carbonate in the liquids obtained in the treatment of 100 kgs of ashes is of about six kgs of 003Ca, and the weight and the kind of the eliminated impurities in this step, are TABLE IV Element kgs eliminated for 100 kgs of treated ashes Iron 0,4 Arsenic 0,27 Bead 0,73 After this elimination of the impurities, the liquids containing the valuable metals, now at a pH of 2,5 to 3, have the following composition TABLE V Element grams litre Iron 5,7 ppm Copper 4,0 grs lt Zinc 7,4 Lead 1,5 Arsenic 0,051 Silver 0,0206 Gold 0,63 Both in the case the optional step of Elimination and separation of impurities is used or not, the liquids with the valuable metals go to a cementation step. In this cementation, the consumption of iron is 0,62 kgs of iron for each 100 kgs of ashes. In the case that the optional modification is not used, the cementation is car ried out at an inlet pH of 0,3 and the consumption of iron is 1,26 kgs of iron for each 100 kgs of ashes. In the following a table is given in which are listed the composition of the liquids at the exit from the cementation, the kgs of metals cemented and the percentages of metals recovered in relation to their initial contents in 100 kgs of ashes.

The liquids of this last step of the recovery of the zinc contain about 200 grs litr of calcium chloride and are recycled to the step.of washing and separation already mentioned and thenoe to the reactor to produce the slurry with fresh ashes, etc. The liquids exiting from the recovery step of the zinc have the following composition TABLE X Metal ppm Iron 2,2 Copper 0,3 Zino 0,3 Lead 3,0 Arsenic 11,0 Having fully described the nature of the invention, as well as the manner to realize it, it is understood that the indicatione previously given are subject to changes in details, provided they do not modify the basic concept of the invention.
