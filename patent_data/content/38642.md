# A monoclonal antibody against hepatitis B and its production, a hybridoma producing the monoclonal antibody and compositions containing it, the propagation of the hybridoma and the monoclonal antibody for use as an antiviral agent against hepatitus B and in isolating hepatitus b surface antigen from a sample.

## Abstract
The new hybridoma cell lines RF HBs 1, RF HBs 2 and RF BHs 4 each secrete a monoclonal antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen. The production of the antibodies may be carried out in vitro by culturing one of the cell lines or in vivo by establishing one of the cell lines as an ascites tumour in a mouse and isolating antibodies from the ascites fluid or from the serum. The antibodies have therapeutic, preventative, and diagnostic uses in respect of hepatitis B virus infections and can be used to purify hepatitis B surface antigen. The relative specificities of the three monoclonal antibodies make them particularly useful in radiometric assay techniques employing specific combinations of the antibodies in solid phase.

## Description
DESCRIPTIONTITLE MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AGAINST HEPATITIS B VIRUS, THEIR PRODUCTION, COMPOSITIONS AND A KIT CONTAINING THEM, THEIR USE IN ASSAY SYSTEMS, IN PURIFICATION AND IN TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTIONS, CELL LINES SECRETING THE ANTIBODIES, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE CELL LINES AND PROCESSES OF PROPAGATING THE CELL LINES The present invention relates to monoclonal antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg which are secreted by new hybridoma cell lines, and particularly the use of these monoclonal antibodies in assay systems for hepatitis B virus infections The development of new cell lines that can be continuously subcultured has been an important area of research in recent years.One particular application for such cell lines lies in the production of. antibodies, and the introduction of somatic cell hybridisation i.e. cell fusion has provided a research tool which enables production of pure, monoclonal antibodies. By fusing antibody secreting cells with myeloma cells and cloning the resulting antibody secreting hybrids in tissue culture, it has been found possible to produce and select a stable hybrid monoclonal cell line that is capable of secreting a particular antibody. It is thus possible to ensure the production of pure, monospecific antibodies since, in the monoclonal cell line, they arise from one original antibody secreting cell. This ability to produce pure, monospecific antibodies is clearly of great utility for accurate screening, purification of the antigen and in therapeutic preventative applications and the present invention is directed towards the use of these techniques in connection with hepatitis B virus infections. The diagnosis of acute and chronic hepatitis B infection is dependent upon the detection of HBs antigen in a patient s blood. This has generally been achieved by a radioimmunoassay utilising rabbit or horse anti HBs serum absorbed onto polystyrene beads. The HBs antigen in the patient s serum binds to the solid phase antibody and can then be detected by a further application of radiolabelled anti HBs. Another technique for detecting HBs Ag in the liver employs double layer imn unof luorescence. These techniques do, however, involve a primary procedure where the antiserum is raised in rabbits and the antibodies purified by expensive and time consuming affinity chromatography. The use of radioimmunoassay techniques for detecting HBs antigen is well established in connection with blood transfusion services but has not been extensively implemented for screening hospital patients in general. Apart from the obvious desirability of this for reducing risk of infection within the hospital, the identification in particular of obstetric patients who are carriers of hepatitis virus can be of great importance since identification of the carrier mother may allow administration of hyperimmune globulin to the infant shortly after birth and thus considerably reduce the riSk of its developing hepatitis and of becoming a chronic carrier. Any increase in the screening for hepatitis B virus infection and in the possible treatment of the disease will demand large quantities of readily available, high quality anti HBs serum. Three new hybrid monoclonal cell lines have now been found and designated RF HBs l,RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 they have been shown to be stable in culture and each secretes a monoclonal antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen. Moreover, these cell lines are capable of storage in, and recovery from, liquid nitrogen and thus provide a readily available supply of pure monospecific antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen. The present invention accordingly provides a monoclonal antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen which is secreted by the hybridoma cell line RF HBs l,RF HBs 2 or RF HBs 4. Desirably, the monoclonal antibodies are in substantially pure form free from other immunological material. The present invention also provides a composition containing one or more of these monoclonal antibodies and a suitable carrier or diluent. The monoclonal and hence monospecific antibodies of the present invention may be recovered from a culture supernatant or from mouse ascites fluid or serum as is indicated hereinafter. They each show activity against HBs Ag and are precipitated by rabbit anti serum raised against mouse IgG1 heavy chain and against mouse K light chain but not by rabbit antiserum to mouse IgG2a, IgG2b , IgM or IgA or to mouse X light chains. Thus, each monoclonal antibody is an IgG1 k mouse immunoglobulin that reacts with major subtypes of the HBsAg ad and ay and can be produced by culturing the cell line RF HBs l, RF HBs 2 orRF HBs 4. The cell lines RF HBs l, 2 and 4 are hybridoma cell lines which have. been produced by fusing spleen cells from Balb c mice, previously immunized with concentrated hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg , with the HAT sensitive mouse myeloma cell line P3 NSl l Ag4 1 , according to the methods of Kohler and Milstein Eur.J. Immunol. 6, 292 1976 . By cloning procedures using three of these fused cell lines, the hybridoma monoclonal cell lines designated RF HBs l, RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4, respectively,have been isolated. The cell lines RF HBs 11 2 and 4 each appear as a fairly uniform population of cells which morphologically resemble the parent NS1 myeloma in both size and shape having a mean size of 13 pm. They each appear spherical in vulture and have a centrally located nucleus with a large cytoplasmic area, equal to or greater than the nuclear volume.RF HBs 1 differs from the parent line in that although, like the parental line, it grows partially attached to a solid substratum, e.g. glass or plastic, it can be detached from this surface by vigorous agitation and does not require trypsinisation or treatment withEGTA. It also grows as a suspension culture in stirrer culture vessels. RF HBs 2 grows partially attached to a substratum and requires trypsinisation for sub culture, while RF HBs 4 grows as a static suspension culture with passaging being effected by dilution of the culture e.g 1 10. The cells have doubling times of 14.6 hours, 10.7 hours and 9.2 hours, respectively, and will grow in RPMI FCS medium see below each requiring feeding at 2 3 day intervals and sub culturing at 2 3 day intervals for RF HBs l, 3 4 day intervals for RF HBs 2 and 2 3 day intervals for RF HBs 4. The hybridoma cell lines RF HBs 1, 2 and 4 each secrete an antibody of the present invention and the cell lines have each continued to secrete antibody for at least three months in continuous culture. Accordingly, the present invention also provides each of the hybridoma cell lines designatedRF HBs l, 2 and 4 which secrete monoclonal antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen, the cell lines preferably being in substantially pure form free from other cellular material, and compositions containing one or more of these cell lines together with a nutrient medium capable of maintaining the cell line s . An appropriate medium contains a source of carbon, a source of nitrogen and if desired, vitamins, and or inorganic salts, and an example of such a medium is RPMI 1640 supplemented with foetal calf serum e.g. RPMI FCS see below . In the preparation of the hybridoma cell lineRF HBs l, Balb c mice were immunised by intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml of purified HBs antigen diluted 1 1 with complete Freunds adjuvant CFA at a final antigen concentration of 0.7 mg ml. The HBs antigen subtype adw used was purified from HBs antigen positive serum by caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation .Four weeks later, the mice were boosted with a further 0.2 ml injection of the HBs antigen CFA mixture. Six weeks later the mouse that gave the highest serum titre of antibody to HBs antigen, as determined by solid phase radioimmunoassay,was boosted with a further 0.2 mlI.P. injection of HBs antigen in CFA, and killed 5 days after this final boost and the spleen removed. The spleen was teased in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10 v v foetal calf serum, 2m M glutamine and 100 IU each of penicillin and streptomycin RPMI FCS at 37 C, pH 7.2 and sodium bicarbonate concentration of 2 g l, and the resultant suspension was passed several times, gently, in and out of a sterile 10 ml syringe. The single cell suspension was decanted from the few residual lumps of unseparated spleen and the cells were washed twice in serum freeRPMI 1640, centrifuging at 1500 g for 5 minutes. The washed cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640. A semi confluent culture of mouse myeloma cells P3 NSl l Ag4 1 i.e. a culture of cells in an active stage of growth having been maintained in continuous culture at 37 C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 v v foetal calf serum, 2mM glutamine, 100 IU of penicillin and 100 pg streptomycin and 2 x 10 N M 8 thioguanine buffered with bicarbonate CO2 were detached from their culture vessel by mild trypsinisation and washed twice in serum free RPMI 1640 by centrifugation at 400 g. The washed cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 and counted. In order to effect hybridisation, the total spleen cell population was mixed with the myeloma cells in a round bottomed, sterile, 10 ml centrifuge tube in a ratio of 10 to 1 spleen cells to myeloma cells, and co pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 g. After removal of the supernatant, 1 ml of a 40 w w solution of polyethylene glycol PEG 1500 in RPMI 1640, that had been prewarmed to 370C, was added to the cell pellet and gently mixed with the cells. The cell PEG mixture was incubated at 37 C for exactly 7 minutes and then thePEG solution was gradually diluted off the cells by repeated addition of equal volumes of RPMI 1640, until the PEG concentration was below 0.5 Tw . The suspension was centrifuged at 1500 g and the cell pellet gently resuspended and washed twice in serum free RPMI 1640, centrifuging at 1000 g.The washed cell pellet was gently resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI FCS, and incubated for two hours at 37 C and the cells were then distributed, at 1 x 106 cells ml in RPMI FCS, into 24 x 2 ml multiwell tissue culture plates and cultured at 37 C in a 5 CO2 95 air atmosphere. Twenty four hours after fusion, half of the culture medium in each flask was replaced by HAT medium PMI FCS supplemented with 1 x 10 M hypoxanthine, 4 x 10 7M aminopterin and 1.6 x 10 M thymidine .The cultures were supplemented with fresh HAT medium,in this way, every day for the first 3 days and at 2 3 day intervals thereafter, to ensure selection of hybrid cells with the ability to grow in HAT medium. The HAT medium was replaced by HT medium RPMI FCS hypoxanthine and thymidine in stages, beginning at day 40 after fusion and then adapted to growth in RPMI FCS at day 52 after fusion. Supernatants from the hybrid cultures were assayed for antibody to HBs antigen as soon as the wells showed growth of more than 100 cells. Only one culture well contained antibody producing cells though other culture wells did contain viable hybrid cells. The antibody producing hybrid cells from this one culture well were then cloned, initially by limiting dilution of the original cultures onto a feeder layer of spleen cells from a non immunised Balb c mouse, growing the hybrids in 96 x 0.2 ml cluster dishes in RPMI FCS.Growth was produced in 16 wells that had been confirmed as containing only one hybrid cell at the start of the cloning schedule, and from these the cell line RF HBs l was selected as providing a stable hybrid cell line secreting monoclonal antibodies to HBs antigen. This clone of cells has subsequently been recloned twice with the result of 100 antibody producing clones. In the preparation of the hybridoma cell line RF HBs 2, six week old male, Balb c mice were immunised with affinity purified HBsAg subtype ay by intraperitoneal injections of 20 yg HBsAg in completeFreund s adjuvant CFA 0.2 ml per mouse . 2 Weeks later the mice were boosted with a further I.P. injection of 5 pg of HBsAg in CFA and the mouse that gave the highest titre of serum anti HBsAg was boosted after a further 2 weeks by I.P. injection of 5 pg HBsAg in saline.3 Days after the final boost the mouse was killed and the spleen removed. At this time the mouse had a serum anti HBs Ag titre of 1 1000. All anti HBsAg measurements were determined by AUSAB radio immunoassay AbbottLaboratories and antibody titres in this specification are given as the dilution that gives 50 of maximum binding . The. spleen cells from the immunised mouse were dissociated in RPMI FCS at 37 C, pH 7.2 and sodium bicarbonate concentration of 2.0 g l. The total spleen cell population was washed twice with serum free medium RPMI 1640 and mixed with the P3 NSl l Ag4 1 mouse myeloma cells in a 10 1 spleen cell myeloma cell ratio, pelleted and resuspended in 1 ml of 40 w w polyethylene glycol PEG 1500 in RPMI 1640. Following a 7 minute incubation, the PEG was gently diluted from the cells by gradual addition of RPMI 1640. The cell suspension was washed once in RPMI 1640, centrifuged at 1500 g, and then incubated for 2 hours in 3 mlRPMI FCS, after which the cells were plated into 2 ml culture wells at 2 x 106 cells well. All operations were carried out at 370C. The cells were cultured overnight at 37 C inRPMI FCS in a 5 C02 95 air atmosphere, and then half of the medium in each culture well was replaced by HAT medium. The cultures were fed with fresh HAT medium, in this way, at one day intervals for the first 3 days and then at 2 3 day intervals thereafter, to select the hybrid cells from the HAT sensitive myeloma cells. Approximately 3 weeks after fusion the hybrid cells were reintroduced to RPMI FCS medium. Of the 168 wells originally plated, 148 produced growth of hybrid cells, of which 4 showed production of anti HBsAg activity. Of these 4, one hybrid culture that appeared 20 days after fusion has continued to produce antibody to HBsAg. This cell line has been cloned 3 times and one of the resultant antibody secreting clones is the cell line designatedRF HBs 2. In the preparation of the hybridoma cell lineRF HBs 4, six week old male, Balb c mice were immunised with affinity purified HBsAg subtype ad by intraperitoneal injections of 20 pg HBs Ag in complete Freund s adjuvant CFA 0.2 ml per mouse . 3 Weeks later the mice were boosted with a further I.P. injection of 5 pg HBsAg in CFA and the mouse which gave the highest titre of serum anti HBsAg was boosted after a further 10 days by I.P. injection of 5 pg HBsAg in saline. 5 Days after the final boost the mouse was killed and the spleen removed. At this time the mouse had a serum anti HBsAg titre of 1 7000. The procedure was then identical with that used in preparing the hybridoma cell line RF HBs 2 from the dissociation of the spleen cells from the immunised mouse up to the plating at 37 C of the hybridised cells into 2 ml culture wells at 2 x 106 cells well. Culture and selection conditions were also identical with that procedure and, of the 144 wells originally plated, 129 produced growth of hybrid cells, of which 5 showed production of anti HBsAg activity. Of these 5, one hybrid culture that appeared 15 days after fusion has continued to produce antibody to HBsAg. This cell line has been cloned 3 times and one of the resultant antibodysecreting clones is the cell line designated RF HBs 4. A further aspect of the present invention resides in a process for the propagation of the hybridoma cell line RF HBs l, RF HBs 2 or RF HBs 4 which comprises culturing the cells of one of these cell lines in a nutrient culture medium therefor. This method of propagation also represents a means d producing the antibodies of the invention which may be separated from the culture medium. An appropriate nutrient culture medium for the cells of the present invention contains a source of carbon, a source of nitrogen and, if desired, vitamins and or inorganic salts, and is, fdr example, RPMI 1640, supplemented with foetal calf serum e.g. in an amount of about 10 by weight based on the culture medium. RPMI FCS described above is particularly suitable.When growing the cells, a suitable initial concentration is 1 x 105 cells ml for RF HBs l, 1 x 10 cells ml for RF HBs 2 and 2 x 10 cells ml for RF HBs 4. These concentrations should desirably not be allowed to exceed 1 x 106 cells ml, 2 x 106 cells ml and 3 x 106 cells ml respectively. In addition to culturing the cell lines of the present invention in a nutrient medium, it is also possible to implant each one of the cell lines into a mouse to establish an ascites tumour this is generally carried out by intraperitoneal injection of, for example, 4 x 105 I x 106 cells per mouse, into pristane 2,6,10,14 tetramethyl pentadecane primed,Balb c mice. Establishment of an ascites tumour may also be achieved in non pristane primed mice in which case, when propagating RF HBs l cells 1 x 106 2 x 106 cells per mouse should be injected, while the minimum number of cells per mouse forRF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 is 4 5 x 105, The cell lines may also be grown as a solid tumour by subcutaneous injection. The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the hybridoma may then be recovered from the ascites fluid or from the mouse serum and this process of both propagating the cell lines and producing the antibodies represents a still further aspect of the present invention. This means of obtaining the monoclonal antibodies does offer the advantage that the yield of antibodies may, for example, be as much as 10 fold higher than the yield obtainable from the bulk culture of the cells. It will normally take about 2 to 3 weeks for the cells to grow up in the mice. The antibodies of the invention may be used unpurified from such sources as described above, or, preferably,are subjected to purification before use.For example, antibodies to be coupled tc sepharose for use in affinity chromatography are generally purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, while antibodies to be iodinated or biotin conjugated are generally subjected to Protein A purification. The hybridoma cells of the invention may be stored in FCS supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing say 20 0 FCS by freezing in liquid nitrogen at, for example, 5 x 106 cells ml or higher using 10 dimethylsplphoxide as cryoprotectant. The freezing rate is preferably controlled between 40 c and 100 C at 1 2 oC minute and the frozen cells can be stored below 100 C e.g.at 170 C in a liquid nitrogen refrigerator. The monospecific antibodies produced by cell lines RF HBs l, 2 and 4 are of particular value in providing accurate screening tests for patients infected by hepatitis B virus. These antibodies can be used in assay systems, employing for example, immunofluorescent microscopy or immuno electron microscopy, in detecting the presence of HBsAg in cellular material or in serum. Quantitative as says may be carried out by solid phase radiometric assay, and RF HBs l antibody is useful in this respect since it recognises an antigenic epitope that appears with relatively high frequency on the HBsAg molecule.However, particularly useful solid phase radiometric assay systems in accordance with this invention employ combinations of the monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies produced by the RF HBs 2 andRF HBs 4 cell liners, which are of high affinity for epitopes occurring with low frequency on HBs Ag, may be used together as a solid phase, in a radiometric assay for the detection of HBs Ag, either alone or withRF HBs 1 antibody as illustrated in the following Examples.The use of a solid phase comprising RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 antibodies alone is applicable to a one stage radioassay for HBsAg Example 7 below illustrates how these two antibodies between them recognise all HBs Ag molecules , whereas the addition ofRF HBs l antibody to the solid phase acts as an additional safeguard when used in a two stage assay, since RF HBs l antibody, although of lower affinity for HBsAg then the other two monoclonal antibodies, itself recognises all HBsAg molecules, thus ensuring anchorage of the antigen to the solid phase. In solid phaseradiometric assay systems employing these monoclonal antibodies, the RF HBs l antibody is preferably used as radiolabelled tracer, not only because this antibody recognises all HBsAg molecules but also, due to the fact that it recognises an epitope of HBsAg that occurs in high frequency on the mole cule, gives a higher number of counts in the assay than do the other two antibodies, either alone or in combination.Support for the use of all three monoclonal antibodies in a radiometric assay is provided by competitive binding studies see Example 4 below which illustrate that neither RF HBs 2 nor RF HBs 4 antibodies inhibit.the binding of the RF HBs l antibody to HBsAg. Thus, a preferred diagnostic method in accordance with the invention comprises incubating a serum sample taken from a human or animal either in a two stage assay with RF HBs l, RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 antibodies in the solid phase, washing the solid phase and incubating it with radiolabelled RF HBs 1 antibody as tracer or in a one stage assay with RF HBs 2 andRF HBs 4 antibodies in the solid phase and radiolabelledRF HBs l antibody as tracer. In each of these assay systems, the solid phase preferably comprises a plastics or glass substrate on which the antibodies are coated the substrate is particularly preferred in the form of beads, sticks or tubes, e.g. of polystyrene.The present invention also provides these coated substrates e.g. beads,and a diagnostic kit comprising a first container which contains a plastics or glass substrate such as beads, sticks or tubes coated with RF HBs l, RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 antibodies or with RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 antibodies and a second container which contains RF HBs l antibody to which a radiolabel has been attached. In these assay systems, instead of employing RF HBsl antibody with the other two monoclonals of the invention, it is possible to use RF HBs l antibody with one or more other monoclonal antibodies which recognise HBs Ag. Alternative assay methods, in accordance with the invention, may, instead of employing a radiolabel, employ e.g. an enzyme label or a biotinlabel which will generally be linked to the RF HBs l antibody. Further, it is also possible to use one or more of the antibodies of the invention in a haemagglutination assay for HBs Ag. One or more of the monoclonal antibodies of this invention coupled to a solid phase such as cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B CnBr S4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden ,can also be used to remove HBs Ag e.g. from human or animal material, either for the purpose of preparing HBs Ag in a purified form for use in preparing vaccines or for the removal of HBs Ag from material to be given to patients. Thus, the present invention also provides a method of isolating hepatitis B surface antigen from a biological sample which comprises contacting the biological sample with RF HBs 1, RF HBs 2 and orRF HBs 4 antibodies in the solid phase to cause binding of antigen to antibody and subsequently separating the desired purified material from the solid phase. The monoclonal antibodies to HBsAg of the present invention are also of value, particularly the antibodies from RF HBs 1, in clinical applications as an anti viral agent where antibody is to be adminitered directly to patients. The monoclonal antibodies may have a role in the treatment of patients carrying the hepatitis B virus and may neutralise the infectivity of the virus by inhibiting its combination with the receptor site on cells and also enhance the phagocytosis and intracellular digestion of the viruses. Potentially the use of these monoclonal antibodies in this context as a substitute for hyper immune gamma globulin may avoid giving large amounts of non specific immunoglobulin along with the small amounts of the specific antibody, which is the case with conventional serum.Each antibody, particularly that from RF HBs l, may also serve to break tolerance in HBV carriers by binding to theHBs Ag and making it more immunogenic. A further aspect of the present invention is thus a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more of the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier or diluent. For therapeutic and or preventative use, the composition may be in solid or liquid form and presented in a conventional manner for parenteral 6r oral application. Thus, the compositions may be in the form of injectable solutions or in the form of tablets, capsules, solutions or suspensions. The monoclonal cell lines RF HBs l, RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 have been deposited with the CollectionNationale de Cultures de Microorganismes C.N.C.M. at theInstitut Pasteur, Paris on 26th March, 1980, 24th March, 1981 and 24th March 1981, respectively, and have been given the accession numbers I 117, 1.150 and 1.151 respectively. The present invention will now be further illustrated by the following Examples.Example 1 In Vitro Culturing of Cell Line RF HBs l RF HBs 1 cells were seeded at 1 x 5 cells ml in RPM1 1640 medium supplemented with between 5 and 20 v v foetal calf serum. The growth rate of the cells was essentially the same in all media doubling time of 14.6 hours 2.5 but growth was maintained fora longer period of time in 15 and 20 foetal calf serum A seeding density of 1 x 105 cells ml is recommended for optimal growth although lower seeding densities can be employed but result in a longer lag phase of growth. Subculturing should be effected every 2 3 days.Example 2 In Vivo Culturing of Cell Lines 2A RF HBs l. 20 six week old Balb c mice were primed with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml pristane 2,6,10,14tetramethyl pentadecane at day 1 and day 7. At day 14 each mouse was implanted intraperitoneally with 1 x 106 viable hydridoma RF HBs l cells. 10 days following implantation all the mice were showing signs of massive tumour growth and were sacrificed, and the ascites fluid collected via a 19 gauge needle. The ascites fluid was centrifuged at 2000g and the clear supernatants containing RF HBs l antibody collected and stored at 2O0C. 2B RF HBs 2. Balb c mice were primed with 2 intraperitoneal injections of 0.5 ml pristane given at 2, one week intervals prior to implantation of RF HBs 2 cells. Each mouse was then implanted with 4 x 105 viable RF HBs 2 cells and produced ascites tumours. After 20 25 days, when the mice had produced maximum yield of ascitic fluid, they were sacrificed and their ascitic fluid was found to contain approximately 20mg ml protein of which 150pg ml is pure RF HBs 2 antibody.2C RF HBs 4. Balb c mice were primed with 2 intraperitoneal injections of 0.5 ml pristane given at 2, one week intervals prior to implantation of RF HBs 4 cells. Each mouse was then implanted with 5 x 105 viable RF HBs 4 cells and produced ascites tumours. After 15 20 days the mice had produced maximum yield of ascitic fluid found to contain 180 yg ml RF HBs 4 antibody. Example 3 Coatinq of Polystyrene Beads with RF HBs 1RF HBs 2 and RF HBs 4 Monoclonal Antibodies.

Furthermore, when coating beads with combinations of monoclonal antibodies, the antibodies will normally be added to the beads together, since sequential addition of the monoclonals to the beads gives no improvement. The beads, once coated with antibody can be dried, following 3 washes with distilled water, by centrifugation over an absorbant pad. These beads will remain stable at 20 0C for at least 3 months. Example 4 Recognition of HBs Ag by the three monoclonals. The monoclonal antibody produced by. the cell line RF HBs 1 recognises an epitope that is common to the ad and ay subtypes of HBsAg and that is different from the epitopes of HBsAg recognised by the RF HBs 2 and 4 antibodies, as is illustrated in the following competition binding study. Polystyrene beads coated with HBsAg of mixed subtype AUSAB Abbott Laboratories were incubated overnight at room temperature with 50 g ml of eitherProtein A purified RF HBs l, RF HBs 2 or RF HBs 4 antibodies, or with an equivalent titre of horse antiserum to liBs Ag, and then for a further four hours at room temperature with 125 I RF HBs 1 or 1251 RF HBs 2 antibody, iodinated as described in Example 5 100,000 cpm , The results are given inTable 2 below.

This one stage assay is possible since the antibodies are monoclonal which, unlike conventional antisera, do not compete for antigenic binding sites, and is an attractive system for use where very rapid screening methods for HBs Ag are required e.g. in Blood TransfusionCentres and in Blood Products Laboratories, since it involves fewer manipulations than a two stage assay. This assay can be carried out within 2 hours without apparent loss.of sensitivity.Example 10 Use of RF HBs 1 antibody in affinity chromatography of HBsAg RF HBs 1 antibody, partially purified from ascitic fluid by ammonium sulphate precipitation, was coupled to CnBr S4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala,Sweden according to the manufacturers instructions.100 ml of human serum containing HBsAg were passed down this column, resulting in a 98.7 removal of theHBsAg from the serum. In addition, 100 of the removed antigen could be eluted from the column using 3M KI.The antigen was immunogenic in mice and rabbits and was shown to be free from other human serum contaminants by immunoelectrophoresis against a rabbit antiserum to whole serum.Example 11 Use of RF HBs l antibody in the localisation of HBsAg in cellular material TiF HBs l antibody in supernatants from cultures of RF HBs 1 cells was used to identify HBsAg in frozen sections of liver biopsies from HBV bearing humans or chimpanzees or in cells bearing the virus, visualising the antigen antibody complex with a goat antiserum to mouse immunoglobulin, coupled to a fluorescent molecule. Furthermore, Protein A purified RF HBs 1 antibody was conjugated to biotin by incubation of lmg of RF HBs 1 antibody in lml of pH 8.3 bicarbonate saline buffer 0.lM NaHCO3 0.5M NaC1 for 4 hours, at 200C, with 90rg biotin succinamide dissolved at lmg ml in DMSO.Following an overnight dialysis at 40C, against phosphate buffered saline, the RF HBs 1 antibody biotin conjugate was used, in combination with an avidin fluorochrome conjugate or with avidinferritin, to visualise HBsAg by immunofluorescent microscopy and by immuno electron microscopy, respectively.
