## Description
A METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING A SEMICONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICE PROVIDED WITH AN IMPROVED ISOLATION STRUCTURE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a method for manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuit device, and more particularly to the method for producing an improved isolation structure thereof.Description of the Prior Art A semiconductor integrated circuit device has a plurality of active regions, or element regions, and field regions provided between the active regions and covered with a thick oxide film to prevent undesired interaction between circuit elements. The thick oxide film is grown with an anti oxidation mask of silicon nitride film. There is a drawback that a silicon oxide film spreads under the edge of the nitride film to form a so called bird s beak . Due to the bird s beak, the integrated circuit requires a wide region between circuit elements, and thus there is a limit for high integration density. The occurrence of bird s beak is prevented by surrounding the field regions by insulating film. Such measure has been proposed in Japanese Journal of AppliedPhysics Vol. 21, No. 1, 1982 pages 37 to O, According to the proposition, the field region is once grooved, followed by an oxidation for forming a silicon oxide film on the surfaces of the groove and the active regions for forming the circuit elements. Polycrystalline silicon is epitaxially grown on the silicon oxide film to fill the groove. At the same time, the polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the element region with the same thickness of the polycrystalline silicon in the groove. The polycrystalline silicon on the element region is removed by reactive etching method to obtain a flat surface.The thick oxide film is then formed by oxidizing the polycrystalline silicon in the groove with a mask of silicon nitride on the element region. At this time, the spreading of the thick oxide film is prevented by the oxide film on the side of the groove. However, this measure is not effective to increase the integration density. The groove between element regions occupies a wide area and limits the high integration density. In addition, a flat surface is obtained by the reactive etching method. This process for forming flat surface requires a precise control and causes a low production yield. Furthermore, the flat original surface is not recovered at a wide field region by the polycrystalline silicon growth. This fact compels the usage of the conventional thick oxide method at the wide field region. There is an additional drawback based on an electrically floating polycrystalline silicon which is left under the thick oxide film in the groove. This floating polycrystalline silicon causes a leakage current between elements, resulted in an unstable operation of the integrated circuit. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a semiconductor integrated circuit in which circuit elements are formed with a high density and without generating an undesired interaction therebetween. It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved isolation structure of a semiconductor integrated circuit which keeps a surface flatness without using a process requiring a precise control. According to the present invention, there is provided a method for producing a semiconductor device which comprises the steps of forming a groove in a surface region of a semiconductor substrate, forming an insulating film on the side walls of the groove and the remaining surface region of the semiconductor substrate, the semiconductor substrate at the bottom surface of the groove being left exposed, depositting a single crystal silicon in the groove to bury it by selective epitaxial growth method, and forming circuit elements in the surface region of the semiconductor substrate and or the single crystal silicon formed in the groove.Preferably, the side walls of the groove are formed of ,100 planes of the substrate or crystal planes within t8 from tl00 planes of the substrate. The semiconductor device according to the present invention has the insulating film formed on the side walls of the groove, which may be used as isolation region between circuit elements. The required area for the isolation is only the thickness of the insulating film. Therefore, a large number of circuit elements can be integrated with a small area of isolation region.This achieves a very high integration density. For the formation of a thick oxide film, the insulating fi operates as a stopper for spreading the oxide film.Thus, the formation of the thick oxide film is not harmful for the high integration density. The selective deposition technique can be applicable for the formation of single crystal silicon in the groove. The special process for forming a flat surface which cannot be avoided in the prior art is not necessary. This makes the process easy. The side walls are preferably selected as near to00 planes of the semiconductor substrate. Therefore, the obtained surface of the deposited single crystal silicon is kept flat in parallel to the original surface of the semiconductor substrate. This feature makes the subsequent processes very easy and the formation of fine pattern in the subsequent processes possible.Here, if the side walls are selected as crystal planes other than near 100 planes of the semiconductor substrate, such as 110 planes, sides of the deposited silicon surface lowers than the center portion to form a so called facet . This facet gives a difficulty in forming a fine pattern by a photolithographic technique and lowers the dielectric withstand voltage of insulating film deposited thereon. The usage of near 1003 planes as the side walls of the groove prevents the formation of such facet and obtains a flat surface of the deposited silicon. The photolithographic technicue can form a fine pattern. The insulating film deposited on the deposited silicon has a high withstand voltage. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The above and further objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein Figs. l a to l c are sectional views showing the prior art process for forming a semiconductor integrated device Figs. 2 a to 2 f are sectional views showing the process for forming elements regions according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention Fig. 3 is a plan view of the semiconductor substrate at the process shown in Fig. 2 b Fig. 4 a is a plan view of the semiconductor substrate which formed a selectively deposited silicon in grooves having side walls of LIlo planes, and Flg. 4 b is a sectional view taken along the line A At of Fig. 4 a and Figs. 5 a to 5 f are sectional views showing the process for forming field regions according to a second preferred embodiment of the present invention. The prior process for producing a structure for limiting the spreading of the thick oxide film grooves first the field region of a silicon substrate 11 to form grooves 12, as shown in Fig. l a . Then,the surface of the substrate 11 is covered with a silicon oxide film 13 by a thermal oxidation process. Polycrystalline silicon 14 is then deposited on the whole surface of the oxide film 13. At this procedure, the narrow grooves are fi led with the polycrystalline silicon 14, and the polycrystalline silicon 14 in the narrow groove becomes nearly flat with the polycrystalline silicon 14 of other portion, but the polycrystalline silicon 14 in wide groove form a a step with, the polycrystalline silicon 14 of other portion.Thereafter, the polycrystalline silicon 14 is subjected to a reactive etching process to leave the polycrystalline silicon 14 in the grooves 12 only, as shown in Fig. l b . This reactive etching process is a process to be precisely controlled and a significant cause of a low production yield. Furthermore, the reactive etching removes the large part of the polycrystalline silicon 14 in the wide groove. That is, it is impossible to bury the wide groove with the polycrystalline silicon by this prior method. Therefore, the prior method does not form a wide groove at the wide field region, as shown in Fig. l c . After the polycrystalline silicon 14 is filled in the grooves, the surface of the polycrystalline silicon 14 is oxidized to form a thick oxide film 15, and then the silicon substrate surface 16 other than groove is exposed to form circuit elements. At this procedure, the wide field region of the silicon substrate 11 is exposed and then the silicon substrate surface is oxidized to form the thick oxide film 15. This prior art is effective to prevent the thick oxide film 15 from spreading, but is not effective to increase the integration density, The grooves 12 are necessary to isolate the circuit elements. The total area occupied by the groove is considerably large. Thisvlarge area of grooves limits the high integration density. The procedure is not simple and easy. The polycrystalline silicon 14 is deposited all over the substrate surface and grooves. The reactive etching is necessary to renove the polycrystalline silicon 14 on the substrate surface and to obtain a flat surface.This process for forming a flat surface lowers the production yield, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the polycrystalline silicon 14 in the grooves under the thick oxide film 15 is electrically floating region.This electrically floating region causes a leakage current between circuit elements and applies instability to the circuit operation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The process for forming a high density integrated circuit of a first preferred embodiment is shown inFigs. 2 a to 2 f . A P type silicon substrate 31 having a resistivity of 0.5 to 5 ohm. om is used. The silicon substrate 31 preferably has a surface of 00 plane and an orientation flat showing 100 direction. On the surface of the silicon substrate 31, a silicon oxide film 32 is thermally grown and a silicon nitride film 33 and a silicon oxide film 34 are deposited by chemical vapor deposition process. The silicon oxide film 34, the silicon nitride film 33 and the silicon oxide film 32 are selectively etched away to expose surfaces of the silicon substrate 31 by using a photolithographic technique.The exposed surfaces form a checkered pattern, for example. The exposed portions are then subjected to a reactive ion etching process to form grooves 30, as shown in Fig. 2 a . The oxide films 32 and 34 and the nitride film 33 are used as the etching mask. The grooves 30 preferably have a depth of 2wWm. The thickness of the silicon oxide film 34 is selected as a fifth to a tenth of the depth of the grooves 30. The side walls of the grooves 30 are made perpendicular to the surface of the substrate 31 by the reactive ion etching process and are formed of 100 planes or the crystal planes within 8 from the 100 planes of the silicon substrate 31. After the formation of the grooves 30, the oxide film 32 and 34 and the nitride film 33 are removed. The surfaces of the grooves 30 are subjected to a thermal oxidation process to form a silicon oxide film 35 of about 50 nm and then to a chemical vapor deposition process to form a silicon nitride film 36 of about 50 nz covering the whole surface. The silicon oxide film 3 and the silicon nitride film 36 at the bottom surfaces of the grooves 30 are removed by another reactive ion etching process to expose the silicon substrate 31 at the respective bottom surfaces.The damages of the silicon substrate 31 at the bottom surface of the groove 30, which are produced by the reactive ion etching, are removed by an anneal or a wet etching, and a P type single crystal silicon 37 having the same resistivity as the silicon substrate 31 is selectively deposited in the grooves 30 with a thickness of about 2 vm to fill them, as shown in Fig. 2 b . The vapor deposition technique using chlorine vapor achives the selective deposition on the surfaces of the silicon substrate 31 without the deposition on the silicon nitride film 36. An example of the selective deposition uses gasses of SnH2C12 of 0.3 i min, H2 of 1 mien and C1 of lt rnin and a deposition temperature of about 9500C.The impurity may be added by flowing B2H6 gasps together with the above mentioned gasses, implanting B ions after the selective deposition or diffusing boron into the silicon substrate 31 at the bottom surface prior to the selective deposition. The conductivity type of the deposited silicon 37 may be opposite to the substrate 3 by introducing phosphrous or arsenic. The later case is used to form complementary transistors. After the selective deposition, a thermal oxidation film 38 of silicon oxide and a chemically deposited silicon nitride film 39 are formed on the deposited silicon 37, as shown in Fig. 2 c . The silicon nitride film. 39 on portions where a thick oxide film is formed thereafter is removed, followed by a thermal oxidation process to form the thick oxide film 40 shown inFig. 4 d . In this process, the spreading of the thick oxide film 40 is blocked by the nitride film 36 formed on the side walls of the grooves 30. The thick oxide film 40 may be formed on the limited surface portion. The formation of the thick oxide film 40 is performed in an oxidation atmosphere of a gas mixture of 5 H2 and 3 02 and a temperature of 9800C for four hours to obtain a thickness of 8,000 . After the formation of the thick oxide film 40, the silicon oxide films 32 and 38 and the silicon nitride films 36 and 39 are removed from the surfaces of the silicon substrate 31 and the deposited silicon 37 by using hot phosphoric acid and diluted hydrofluoric acid, as shown in Fig. 2 d . A formation of field effect transistors is followed, as shown in Fig. 2 e . The exposed surfaces of the silicon substrate 31 and the deposited silicon 37 is subjected to a thermal oxidation process to form a gate insulator film 41 of silicon oxide film having a thickness of 200 to 400 A. A polycrystalline silicon doped with phosphorus is formed on the gate insulator film 41, and then sb ete to a selective etching process to fcrv gate electrodes 43. Source and drain regions 44 are formed by implanting arsenic ions with a dose of 5 x 1015 cm 2 by using the gate electrodes 43 as a mask.The implanted arsenic ions are activated by annealling, to act as N type impurities. At this procedure, if necessary, adequate irzpurities are implanted into the channel region 42 between the source and drain regions 44. Finally, a silicon oxide layer 45 is deposited on the whole surface. The silicon oxide layer 45 and the gate insulator film 41 on the source and drain regions 44 are selectively etched away to form contact holes 46. Aluminium 47 is then deposited and subjected to a selective etching process to form a wiring pattern, as son in Fig 2 f . The ohmic connections between the alur inium 47 and the source and drain regions 44 are achieved by alloying them in high temperature circumstance. According to the above explained first preferred embodiment, the circuit elements are isolated by the oxide film 35 and the nitride film 36 formed on the side walls cf the grooves 30 without damaging the surface flatness. The area required for the isolation is only thicknesses of the oxide film 35 and the nitride film 36.Thus, a high integration density of circuit elements is achieved. Here, the electric potential at the wiring aluminium crossing the oxide and nitride films 35 and 36 does not produce any parasitic channel between circuit elements, because the oxide and the nitride films 35 and 36 are easily formed with a deep depth and any electrically floating region does not exist between the circuit elements.Thus, a perfect isolation between circuit elements is achieved with a very small isolation area, resulted in a possibility of a very high integration density.Furthermore, if the thick oxide film 40 is formed on a region outside the circuit element regionsthe oxide film 40 does not spread into the circuit element regions by the oxide and nitride films 35 and 36. Thus the formation of the thick oxide film 40 does not lower the high integration density. The process does not rewire any technique to be precisely controlled. Here, the surface condition of the deposited silicon 37 will be explained in detail with reference to Figs. 3, 4 a and 4tub . According to the first preferred embodiment, the grooves are formed so as to have side walls of t1003 planes as shown in Fig. 3 or the crystal planes within 8 from the t100 planes.The surface of the substrate 31 is selected as 100 plane. Almost all surface grows equally to keep flatness.If the corners D are rounded, only such rounded corners D grow slowly the single crystal silicon to form a graded surface having a crystal direction 111 , t31 or 411 .This graded surface is limited to a small area. The flatness is not disturbed. On the contrary, if the grooves are formed so as to provide side walls of 110 planes as shown in Fig.4 a , the sides of the deposited silicon surface show a gradient as shown in Fig. 4 b to form a so called facet . The gradient is a crystal directlon t311 or on on which silicon 23 grows slowly. As a result, discontinuities appears at portions B and C . If an insulating film is formed on such facet surface the insulating film shows a low withstand voltage at the portions and ct A photolighographic technique is applied to such facet surface, fine pattern cannot be formed. The second preferred embodiment in which the present invention is applied to the field reagion of a semiconductor integrated circuit device will be explained with reference to Figs. 5 a to 5 f . A P type silicon substrate 131 having 0.5 to 5 ohm.cm and 100 plane is used. A silicon oxide film 132 is thermally grown on the surface of the substrate 131 followed by a chemical vapor depositions of a silicon nitride film 133 and a silicon uxide filw 134. A pIiotollthographic technique is applied to etch away the oxide films 132 and 134 and the nitride film 133 on portions of the substrate 131 at which field regions are formed in the later process.The exposed surface of the substrate 131 is subjected to a reactive ion etching process to form grooves 135 having a depth of 2 m, m, as shown in Fig. 5 a . During the reactive ion etching process, the remaining oxide films 132 and 134 and nitride film 133 function as an etching mask. The side walls of the grooves 135 are formed straight by the usage of the reactive ion etching technique or other directional etching technique. Side walls of all grooves 135 is formed with 100 planes of the substrate 131. On the contrary to the prior art process, the grooves 135 are formed at not only the narrow field regions but also the wide field regions. After the remaining oxide films 132 and 134 and nitride film 133 are removed, the whole surface of the substrate 131 is subjected to a thermal oxidation process to form a new silicon oxide film 136, followed by a chemical deposition of silicon nitride film 137. Another reactive ion etching is applied to remove the oxide film 136 and the nitride film 137 from the bottoms of the grooves 135.A single crystal silicon 138 is selectively deposited in the groves with a thickness of about 1.6 sm as shown in Fig. 5 b . The chemical vapor deposition using gasses of SiH2C12, H2 and HC1 achieves the selective deposition of silicon on crystalline silicon surface with keeping the nitride film 137 exposed. The conductivity type is applied by introducing gas including impurities into the gasses for the chemical vapor deposition of silicon. When P type is used as the substrate 131, the impurity is boron and is introduced as a form of B2H6 into the deposition gas. The resistivity of the deposited silicon 138 is made lower than the substrate to operate as a channel stopper. The surface portions of the deposited silicon 138 are thermally oxidized to form thick oxide films 139 of 0.8An, as shown in Fig. 5tic . At this procedure, the spreading of the oxide film 139 is blocked by the nitride film 137 formed on the side alls of the grooves 135.Thus, the formation of the thick oxide film 139 is limited on the deposited silicon region 138. After the formation of the thick oxide films 139, the exposing oxide film 136 and nitride film 137 are removed to expose the surfaces of the substrate 131. A gate insulator film 140 of silicon oxide is newly formed on the exposed surfaces of the substrate 131 by a thermal oxidation technique, as shown in Fig. 5 d . Adequate ion implantation is performed to surface portion 141 of the substrate 131 to control the threshold voltages of the field effect transistors which are formed later. .A polycrystalline silicon doped with phosphorous is deposited on the gate insulator film 140 and then patterned as gate electrodes 142 by using a photolithographic technique. Phosphorous ions are implanted by using the gate electrodes 142 as an ion implantation mask. The implanted phosphorous ions are activated by annealing to form source and grain regions 143, as shown in Fig. 5 e . Finally, silicon oxide film 144 is deposited to cover the whole surface. Selective portions of the silicon oxide film 144 and the gate insulator film 140 are removed to form contact holes 145. Aluminium 146 is then evaporated on the whole surface and is selectively etched away to form a wiring pattern, as shown in Fig. 5 f . According to the second preferrred embodiment of the present invention, the selective vapor deposition can be used. Tis fact removes the etching process for forming a flat surface which requires a strict control and a main cause of lowering production yield. That is, the process is very easy. In addition, the crystalline silicon grows in wide grooves, similarly to in narrow grooves. All field regions are formed by same process. The surface of the deposited silicon is flat due to 100 surface side walls of the grooves 135.This flatness makes the following procedur easy. Furthermore, the deposited silicon 138 under the thick oxide film 139 electrically contact with the substrate 131. There is no electrically floating regions.This makes the circuit operation stable. The leakage current between circuit elements is prevented by the oxide film 136 and the nitride film 137 formed on side walls of the grooves 135. Besides, it is prevented more perfectly by the usage of the low resistivity silicon as the deposited silicon 138 which functions as a channel stopper. Although the thick oxide film 139 is formed by the thermal oxidation in the second preferred embodiment, it may alternatively formed by being deposited by RF bias sptterin technique, a combination of a chemical vapor cepositior. technique and a sputtering technique or a combination of a chemical vapor deposition technique and a silica painting technique. Several preferred embodiments are explained hereinbefore. The present invention, however, is not limited to those embodiments. For example, any types of circuit elements such as bipolar transistors or junction field effect transistors may be replaced with insulated gate field effect transistors used in the er odiments. The reactive ion etching used for forming grooves may be replaced with other etching technique which perform a uniform planl etching with very little side etching, such as reactive sputter etching.
