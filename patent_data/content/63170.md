# PNEUMATIC WIRE LIFTER AND METHOD

## Abstract
The invention is an air lifter for fine gage wires and is particularly adapted to cooperate with a wire bonder machine which intermittently advances lead frames along a pathway therethrough for MOS plastic packaging and bonds fine gage wires between terminals of a die or integrated chip, fixed to a pad carried by each lead frame, and a plurality of lead frame fingers of electrical connectors distributed about the pad periphery and spaced therefrom across a gap. It includes means for developing gas pressure for gas blasts pneumatic directing means disposed adjacent the pathway for the lead frames travelling through the machine at a location downstream of the wire bonding station for direct ing gas blasts at the wires to raise them above the pad with the directing means confining the gas blasts generally externally of and along the pad periphery in the gap region to bend the wires upwardly away from the pad, and timing means operating in synchronism with the advancing of the lead frames for initiating and terminating the gas blasts during the dwell intervals of the frames. The litter, per se, avoids the synchronizing mechanism and includes means for developing gas pressure for manually controlled gas blasts pneumatic gas directing means for directing gas blasts at one or more wires from beneath to raise them intermediate their ends and means for controlling the pressure and duration of said blasts with the directing means confining the gas discharge to the region of the one or more wires.
