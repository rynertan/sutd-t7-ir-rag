# CCD IMAGER DETECTOR BUFFER

## Abstract
A photodetector buffer for a charge coupled device hav ing a linear response includes a field effect transistor having its drain and gate connected to the photodetector output, the gate also being connected to a control electrode overlying an output charge flow channel. The response of the device is inherently linear and non inverting and is substantially insen sitive to threshold voltage nonuniformities.
