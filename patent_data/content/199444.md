## Description
POLYMER COMPOSITION The present invention relates to polymer compositions suitable for use particularly in the field of wire and cable insulation and to a process for the production of such compositions. More particularly the invention relates to polymer compositions which exhibit a reduced tendency to form water trees when employed as medium and high voltage electrical insulation. Polymer compositions employed as insulation for medium and high voltage wire and cable are well known. Generally such compositions are based on polyolefins such as for example low density high pressure polyethylene, low density high pressure ethylene copolymers and linear low density polyethylene. Such materials may be employed as insulation in crosslinked or uncrosslinked form. A problem associated with the application of these polymeric compositions as medium or high voltage insulation is their tendency to failure under certain conditions due to a phenomenon known as water tree growth in the insulation. Water tree growth is generally found to occur most frequently in wire and cable insulation situated in damp locations and the phenomemon can lead to electrical power leakage or complete breakdown of the insulation. A number of proposals for retarding the growth of water trees are suggested in the prior art. DT A 2737430 describes an insulation composition having reduced tendency to form water trees comprising a polyolefin and an alkoxy silane. GB A 2055854 describes a polymeric composition for electrical insulation comprising a polymeric component, from 0 to 10 weight Z of filler and, as water treeing and electrical treeing inhibitor for the composition, at least one defined organic silicon compound which can be, for example, vinyl tris 2 methoxyethoxy silane. US A 4543381 relates to a polymeric composition having enhanced reistance to water treeing and electrical treeing consisting essentially of a homogeneous mixture of a polymeric component and a water treeing and electrical treeing inhibitor consisting essentially of I a defined silane compound and 2 an unsubstituted or aryl substituted C10 to C20 fatty acid. The preferred silane compounds are methyl tris 2 phenoxyethoxysilane and vinyl tris 2 phenoxyethoxy silane. The fatty acid component is preferably stearic acid, phenyl stearic acid or tolyl stearic acid. It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition suitable for use as insulation having improved water treeing resistance. Accordingly the present invention provides a composition suitable for use as electrical insulation comprising a polymeric component and, as water tree growth retardant, one or more componds having the general formula NR3R4 RR1N CH2 pNR2 CH2 q or partially condensed derivatives thereof, wherein the groups R, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are selected from CH2 mSi yly2y3 and hydrogen and p and q are each from 2 to 4 with the proviso that at least one of the groups R, R1, R2,R3 orR4 is CH2 mSiYlY2Y3, and wherein m is 1 to 18, pl is a hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy group containing 1 18 carbon atoms andY2,Y3 are hydrocarbyloxy groups containing 1 18 carbon atoms. The present invention further provides a process for preparing a composition suitable for use as electrical insulation comprising mixing together a polymeric component, and as a water tree growth retardant, one or more compounds having the general formula RRlN CH2 pNR2 CH2 qNR3R4 or partially condensed derivatives thereof, wherein R, R1, R2, R3,R4, p and q are as defined above, the mixing being carried out under conditions such that polymeric component and the water tree growth retardant form a substantially homogeneous blend. Water tree growth retardant compounds preferred for use in the composition of the present invention are those wherein at least three of the groups R, R1,R2,R3 and R4 are hydrogen and not more than two of these groups are CH2 mSiYlY2Y3 hereinafter referred to as the silane group . Most preferably four of the groups R, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are hydrogen and the fifth group is the silane group.Preferred combinations of silane groups hydrogen in the defined formula are as follows 1 R3 silane group R, R1,R2,R4 X H 2 R1,R3 silane groups R, R2, R4 H 3 R3,R4 silane groups R, R1,R2 H 4 R2,R3 silane groups R, R1,R4 H. It is preferred to use the defined water tree retardant compounds wherein m is in the range 1 to 12, most preferably in the range 2 to 6. Preferably p and q are both equal to 2. Y1,Y2 and Y3 are preferably alkoxyl groups containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably 1 6 carbon atoms. Methoxyl, ethoxyl and normal or isopropoxyl groups are particularly preferred. An example of a particularly preferred compound is H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NHCH2CH2CH2si OcH3 3 i.e. N1 beta aminoethyl N beta aminoethyl gamma aminopropyltrimethoxysilane . Partially condensed derivatives of the defined water tree growth retardant are also effective in inhibiting water treeing in the composition of the present invention. The condensed derivatives are formed by partial hydrolysis of one or more of the hydrocarbyloxy groups and elimination of the corresponding hydrocarbinol. An example of such partial hydrolysis is represented by the following reaction 2 Z CH2 3Si OCH3 3 H20 reacts to form Z CH2 3Si OGH3 20 0CH3 2Si CH2 3 Z 2 CH3OH wherein Z is a RR1N CH2 pNR2 CH2 qNR4 group.The condensed molecules contain the siloxane linkage SiOSi. The condensation step can be repeated several times to form a longer chain. The quantity of water tree retardant employed in the composition of the present invention suitably lies in the range O.Olto 5.0 weight , preferably 0.5 to 3.0 weightZ, most preferably 0.7 to 2.0 weight based on the total weight of the composition. The polymeric component employed as the insulating material in the composition of the present invention can be, for example, low density polyethylene LDPE or copolymers of ethylene with alkyl acrylate, alkyl methacrylate, or vinyl acetate linear ethylene polymers or copolymers eg LLDPE or blends of the aforesaid polymers. Particularly preferred as the polymeric component areLDPE, ethylene ethylacrylate copolymer EEA , ethylene butyl acrylate, ethylenefvlnyl acetate copolymer EVA and linear low density polyethylene or blends of two or more thereof. Particularly preferred blends are LLDPE LDPE, blends of PEA or ethylene butyl acrylate copolymer with LDPE, LLDPE or LDPE UTtPE and blends of EVA with LDPE, LLDPE or LDPE LLDPE.The ethylenelalkylacrylate or ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers preferably contain from 1 to 30 weight of copolymerised alkyl acrylate or vinyl acetate units based on weight of the copolymer. A particularly preferred polymeric component is ethylene ethylacrylate copolymer or a blend of LDPE with ethylene ethylacrylate copolymer wherein the total ethylacrylate content in the component lies in the range 0.5 to 5 wt . The aforesaid polymers or blends can also contain other suitable insulating polymeric materials, for example, high density polyethylene or polypropylene. The melt index of the polymeric component prior to any crosslinking suitably lies in the range 0.1 to 10 as measured by ASTM D 1238 2.16 Kg l900 . The polymer compositions of the present invention are preferably free from filler materials. The compositions of the present invention can be crosslinkable or uncrosslinkable. By crosslinkable is meant that the composition can contain a chemical crosslinking agent.Uncrosslinkable compositions do not contain a chemical crosslinking agent but they can be crosslinked, eg by the use of ionising radiation, subsequent to forming into useful articles if desired. Crosslinkable compositions in accordance with the present invention suitably comprise the polymeric component, the defined water tree retardant and a peroxide or hydroperoxide crosslinking agent. Examples of peroxide crosslinking agents suitable for use in the present invention are dicumyl peroxide, 2.5 bis tertiary butyl peroxy 2,5 dimethyl hexane, di tertiary butyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl cumyl peroxide, 2.5 bis tertiary butyl peroxy 2,5 dimethyl hexyne and bis tertiary butyl peroxy disopropyl benzene. The quantity of organic peroxide for use in the crosslinkable composition of the present invention is suitably 0.3 to 10.0 wtt, preferably 0.5 to 5.0 wt based on the total composition. It will be understood that the peroxide is suitably selected so that it has a relatively long half life eg greater than 0.5 hours at the processing temperature but a relatively short half life eg less than 10 minutes at the temperature employed during the subsequent curing step. The composition of the present invention can be prepared using techniques well known in the art to produce homogeneous dispersions of polymeric materials. The mixing is preferably carried out at a temperature such that the polymeric material is in the form of a melt. When the polymeric component is employed in the form of granules e.g. pellets or powder the mixing can be carried out, if desired, by contacting the granules with the water tree growth retardant, optionally with one or more other additives, e.g.antioxidant, under conditions which lead to absorption of the additives by the polymer. Preferably the compound employed as water tree growth retardant is above its melting temperature during the mixing. The components can be mixed, for example, using multi roll mills, screw mills, continuous mixers, extruders, compounding extruders or Banbury mixers. Minor amounts of other additives, for example, antioxidant, plasticers or processing aids, metal deactivators, pigments, heat and light stabilizers and antistatic agents can be incorporated if desired. The compositions of the present invention find use primarily as wire and cable insulation, particularly in medium and high voltage applications. The insulation can be applied to the wire and cable using conventional coating techniques, eg extrusion coating. The present invention is illustrated in the following Examples and Comparative Tests.Example 1 The following Table 1 illustrates the water tree growth properties of an unmodified conventional high pressure low density polyethylene LDPE insulation and the same LDPE containing quantities of water tree growth retardent compound A . The polymer and the compound A were blended at 2000C to form a homogeneous mixture and test specimens were moulded from the mixture. Compound A comprises H2NCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH CH2 3Si 0CH3 3. The relative water tree growth rate WTGR was determined after the insulation had been held at 5KVJ6kHz for 72 hours at 65do. This method for determining WTGR is described by A.C. Ashcraft in the paper Water treeing in Polymeric Dielectrics , World Electrical congress in Moscow, June 22, 1984.

Tests 1 and 2 show the WTGR for the polyethylene without water tree growth retardant additive. Test 3 shows the use of an additive in accordance with the present invention and Test 4 shows the use of an additive having somewhat similar chemical formula but which is not in accordance with the present invention. The compositions were in each case prepared by blending at 2000C the base polymer with additive when used and conventional antioxidant to form a homogeneous mixture which was then pelleted. The pellets together with 2 weight percent dicumyl peroxide were then extruded and crosslinked at 180 2000C to form moulded test specimens.
