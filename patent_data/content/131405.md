# Hall effect device.

## Abstract
A hall effect device for responding to weak magnetic fields uses a small chip 3 of gallium arsenide located between the overlapped ends of two flux concentrators 2,5 . The spacing between the concentrators may be as small as 95 micrometres. The flux concentrator 2, 5 , which serve to enhance the device s sensitivity are made of amorphous magnetic material, i.e. a metallic glass, which has high permeability.
