# CLASSIFYING PARTICLES

## Abstract
Apparatus for classifying a mixture of particles compris es an inclined surface 1, and a collector 4 separated by a uniform gap 3 from the lower edge of the inclined surface and aligned with that surface, a receiver 5 located below the gap 3 and a series of guides 6 6 uniformly spaced across the width of the lower end of the inclined surface. Elongate particles of sufficient length are either aligned longitudinally, in which case they bridge the gap and pass to the collector, or else ride up the guides to be carried across the gap by them. In this way the elongate particles can be eliminated.
