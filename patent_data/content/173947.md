# Wideband integrated services local communication system.

## Abstract
The system comprises a plurality of units NCUl....NCUn arranged along a unidirectional line 1 , whereupon informa tion is transmitted relevent to circuit switched and packet switched communications and organised into hybrid frames comprising a region for each communication type. The units comprise devices APH handling the access to the line 1 which cooperate with one another and with a frame signal generator, centralised or associated with each unit, to implement in distributed way an ordered protocol without collisions in both frame regions, based on physical unit location.
