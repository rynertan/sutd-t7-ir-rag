## Description
Apparatus for Providing a Referene This invention relates to apparatus for providing a reference and particularly, but not exclusively, to clamps or brackets for mounting a reference on a footing. When building the walls of a house or other brick or block structure, it is obviously important that the walls are true vertically and that the bricks lie horizontal in their courses. Traditionally, this has been achieved by building up the corners of the structure first, on the footing, and taking very great care to ensure that the corners are absolutely true. This requires great skill and experience and is extremely time consuming. The gaps between the corners are laid in forward and backward runs and this can be done by relatively inexperienced bricklayers. These sections of the walls can also be laid at great speed by experienced bricklayers. Although the vast majority of corners are still built freehand , free standing devices have been proposed to provide a constant reference for the bricklayer to limit the amount of time taken in checking the work brick by brick. However, the known constructions are extremely complicated and cumbersome. They thus take a along time to set up and are very expensive. They are also limited in their use in that they are designed either to provide a reference on an external corner or an internal corner, but not both. For these reasons the devices have not made any impact in the bricklaying field. It is an object of the present invention to provide a versatile and economic device for providing a reference. From one aspect the invention consists in a clamp or bracket rigidly mountable on a footing, or the like, at or adjacent a corner thereof to hold a reference member in a desired orientation with respect to the footing. The term footing, or the like, in the specification covers any wall or structure made out of bricks or blocks.For example the clamp can be used when constructing pillars, stopped ends or gable ends. From a second aspect the invention consists in a clamp or bracket for holding a reference at the corner of a footing, or the like, comprising a body, attachment means for attaching the body to the footing at or adjacent the corner, the body being shaped to define a recess for receiving a reference member and adjustable holding means for engaging the reference member in the recess to hold the reference member in a desired position relative to the footing. From a third aspect the invention may consist in a clamp comprising means for gripping a reference member and means for mounting the gripping means on a footing. The gripping means may be in the form of tightenable bands and the mounting means may comprise any suitable releasable fastening element or device e.g. a sucker or a bolt. From a fourth aspect the invention consists in a method for building a wall on a footing, comprising securing vertical reference members at each corner of one length of the footing so that a line on each reference member extends generally along the intended line of its respective corner, extending a horizontal reference between the vertical members and laying bricks on the footing in a course, corner to corner, by orientating the bricks in accordance with the horizontal and vertical references. The method may further include marking up the courses of the wall on the vertical members prior to laying bricks. From another aspect the invention consists in a clamp or bracket rigidly mountable on a footing, or the like, at or adjacent a corner thereof to hold a reference member in a desired orientation with respect to the footing, the clamp or bracket comprising a body defining internal or external orthogonal surfaces and a recess for receiving the reference member, means for adjusting the orientation of the reference member and means for attaching the body to the footing with one of the pair of surfaces engaging the opposite surfaces of the corner such that the recess is held in a predetermined position with respect to the corner line. Preferably the recess is formed to provide a horizontal pivot line for the reference member in which case the means for adjusting the orientation of the reference preferably act on the reference member above and below the pivot line. The recess may be narrowest at the pivot line and in a preferred embodiment is formed by an aperture, open at each end, which tapers from each end to or adjacent its centre. The body may be generally L shaped and may have slots extending through each arm to allow the attachment means to extend through the arms into the brick work.Typically the attachment means are in the form of hooks or clamps. Conveniently, the slots are generally at the level of the pivot line and it is preferred that they are positioned so that the attachment means can engage the centre of a brick in each course and, preferably, the arms are clamped to bricks in different courses. The clamp may further include a guide for a horizontal line, the guide being slidably mountable on the reference member such that the line is held by the guide to extend along at least one wall of the footing or an edge thereof. The guide may have a first set of guide members for guiding the line when the clamp is mounted on an internal corner and a second set of guide members for use when the clamp is on an external corner. The guide may be generally L shaped with an abutment on the free end of one arm to grip the reference member so that the guide can be held on the reference member at any vertical position by the tension in the line. The clamp may further include a shield interposable between the reference member and the adjustment means to protect the reference member0 The shield may be shaped to project from the recess to overlie at least part of the adjustment means to reduce the possibility of the adjustment means becoming clogged with mortar during use. From another aspect the invention consists in a guide for a line for defining a horizontal, wherein the guide can be mounted on a vertical reference and held in any position on the reference by the tension in the line. Preferably the vertical reference members are secured by clamps or brackets as hereinbefore defined. From a further aspect the invention consists in a device for providing a vertical reference comprising a hollow elongate body or frame and a plumb line suspended within the body at one end and loosely held at the other end such that the line is kept in extension whatever the orientation of the body1 and means for viewing the plumb line. The invention may be performed in various ways, specific embodiments of which will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic view showing a clamp mounted on an external corner of a footing and holding a reference member Figure 2 is a plan view from above of a clamp mounted on an internal corner of a footing and holding a reference member. Figure 3 is a view from above of the body of a clamp with an associated guide indicated in dot dash lines Figure 4 is a side view of the body ofFigure 3 when viewed on the arrow C Figure 5 is a side view of the body ofFigure 3 when viewed on the arrow D Figure 6 is a perspective view of a shield for use with the body of Figure 3 Figure 7 is a perspective view of the guide indicated in Figure 3 Figure 8 is an isometric view of a further clamp Figure 9 is a view from above of the clamp of Figure 8 attached to the wall and Figure 10 is a front view of a reference member. Figure 1 shows a clamp, generally indicated at 10, which comprises a generally L shaped body 11, gripping members 12 and reference holding elements 13o The clamp 10 can be mounted at a corner 14 of a footing 15 to secure a reference member 16. The body 11 has a pair of orthogonal limbs 17 each of which carries a lateral projection 18,19 at its free end the projections 18, 19, project to the right of their respective limb, when viewed from the corner of the L. Each projection is formed with a set of four holes 20 extending horizontally therethrough the holes being arranged in two vertical sets, each set being laterally spaced from the other, on its projection, by the thickness of a limb 17 and the holes within a set being spaced vertically by at least the thickness of a brick. The holes 20 are provided to receive and locate the gripping members 12. In use, only one gripping member per projection is used the hole 20 selected being determined by the construction of a footing. A pair of vertically spaced threaded holes 21 is provided in each of the limbs 17 and further threaded holes 22 are formed, in projection 19, at right angles to the holes 20. The threaded holes 21 and 22 receive the reference holding elements 13 again the holes selected depend on the particular use and orientation of the body 11. If the body 11 is to be attached to an external corner of a footing, the gripping members 12 and reference holding elements 13 are disposed in the body as shown inFigure 1. It will be seen that one end of each gripping member 12 has an orthogonal flange 23, whereas the other end is threaded to carry a lock nut 24. The reference holding elements 13 also carry lock nuts 25. The clamp 10 is presented to the corner and the gripping members are passed through spaces between the bricks, by orientating the flanges 23 vertically to pass through the gaps and then turning them through 90 to engage the bricks. The body 10 is then clamped to the wall by tightening the lock nuts,. The gaps are normally formed by knocking out mortar from between the bricks. The body 4 is so dimensioned that the projection 18 lies opposite one gap in the upper course of the footing, whilst the projection 19 lies opposite a corresponding gap in the course below and in tho other wall. The position of these gaps determines which hole 20 is selected. A reference member 16, which may be a straight piece of wood, or a spirit level, is then placed into the recess 26, which is defined by the footing 15 and the body 11. By suitable movement of the reference holding elements 13, the reference member 16 is orientated so that it extends vertically and is held with one corner extending generally along the line of the corner of the footing. Once this position is achieved the elements 13 are locked in position by lock nuts 25. Thus the reference member 16 provides the bricklayer with an exact position for the corner and a true vertical, against which he can lay his bricks. In addition the bricklayer can mark off the courses on the reference member 16.This enables an experienced bricklayer to build a corner much more quickly and an inexperienced bricklayer to build a corner the building process can be even further simplified if a reference member 16 is erected at each end of a length of the footing and a horizontal line is extended between the members. The wall can then be built in forward and backward runs from corner to corner so that the whole wall goes up at a constant level, without the corners being built first. When the other length of wall is built, it is simply tied into the first. This enables buildings to be constructed much more quickly. For an internal corner the gripping members 12 are then inserted into the body 11 as shown in Figure 2 and the body is clamped to the inside corner of the footing. The reference member 16 is inserted into a recess 27, which is this time defined by the projection 19 and it is held there by reference elements 13. In this case one of the elements 13 is engaged in one of the threaded holes 22 in projection 19. Thus the clamp 10 can be mounted on internal or external corners merely by reversing and repositioning the gripping members 12 and the reference holding elements 13. Figures 3 to 6 show an alternative clamp having a body 30 which is generally L shaped with a thin arm 31 and a thick arm 32, each of these arms being narrowed towards its free end to reduce the amount of material required. At the intersection of the arms 31,32, but in the thickness of the arm 32, the body is formed with an aperture 33 which extends right through the body and which tapers from each of its open ends to a centre line 34. Each of the arms 31, 32, is formed with a horizontal slot 35, 36, extending through the arm at the level of centre line 34. The arms define two pairs of orthogonal surfaces 37, 38 and 39, 40, on the external and internal faces of the body. In use the body 30 can be clamped with its external surfaces 37, 38 engaging the internal walls of the corner of a footing or with its internal surfaces 39,40 engaging the external surface of a corner of a footing In this case the members 23 are passed through the slots 35,36 the vertical positioning of which enables the hooked ends of members 23 to engage the centre of a brick in the course above or below the level of the slot. By turning the hooked end upwardly on one wall of the corner and downwardly on the other wall of the corner the body may be clamped to different courses of the footing. The reference member 16 is then inserted in the aperture 33 and its position is adjusted by means of adjustment screws not shown which pass through apertures indicated at A. It will be seen that the screws lie above and below the centre line 33 so that the vertical position of the reference member can readily be adjusted by pivoting the vertical member about the right angle pivots formed at the centre line 33. When the body 30 is mounted on an external corner the face 41 of the reference member 16 is aligned with the internal face of the arm 31 and hence the external face of the footing. Conversely when the body 30 is mounted on an internal corner of the footing the reference member is fitted into the corresponding corner of the aperture 33. In either case before the adjustment screws are engaged, a shield 42, of the form shown in Figure 6, can be interposed between the screws and the reference member such that horizontal flanges 43 overlie the screws and prevent mortar dropping into their threads. Having positioned the reference member in the correct alignment with the corner and in a precise vertical position the builder is in a position to build up a corner, as described above. If a line, is to be uses a guide 44 see Figures 3 and 7 is provided. The guide 44 is generallyL shaped with an orthogonal abutment 45 at one free end.Posts 46 project vertically at each of the free ends and at the corner of the guide. The corner is cut away at 47 and provided with horizontal notches 48 in the cut away portion.Upwardly and downwardly extending abutments 49 are provided on at least one arm of the guide 44 to prevent rotation of the guide about a horizontal axis. As can be seen inFigure 5, the guide 44 is fitted around the reference member 16 so that the position of the posts 46 and notches 48 are clearly defined by the position of the reference member 16.The geometry of the guide 44 and the body 30 are such that, when the body 30 is mounted on an external corner a line 50 run around the posts 46 will extend along the edge of the wall being built and on an external corner a line engaged in one of the notches 48 will run along the internal edge of the wall or footing. Thus the builder is provided with very precise horizontal and vertical references and in addition with a reference to the desired position of the wall. As each course is built it will be desired to raise the line 50 and this can easily be achieved by sliding the guide 44 up the reference member to the next desired position for example as indicated by course marks on the reference member . The tension in the line 50 is sufficient to retain the guide at this position. Thus it will be seen that not only is the construction of this embodiment simpler than that described above it also provides more accurate references. In addition the provision of the slots 35, 36 on a common line enables clamping to occur on the centre of bricks rather than at their ends and this means that there is much less likelihood of distortion or damage to the wall. Indeed it has been found possible to attach the body 30 to a footing when the mortar is only some five or ten minutes old. A further clamp is shown in Figures 8 and 9.In this case the body 60 is generally shaped and has an aperture 33 at the intersection. The aperture 33 is formed as in the embodiment of Figures 3 to 5 but only two orthoginal elongate pivots 61,62 are formed at the centre line. Opposed to each of these pivots 61, 62 are vertically spaced pairs of reference member adjustment screws 63 which extend through their respective limbs 64, 65 of the body 60 to large adjustment knobs 66. A key hole slot 67 is formed between one pair of knobs 66, whilst a wire drum and ratchet assembly 68 are disposed in a slot 69 between the other pair. In use the body 60 can be attached to either an internal or external corner by threading a wire 70 from the drum 71 of assembly 68 through an adjacent bed joint around an angle abutment 72, described below, through a bed joint in the other wall of the corner and into key hole slot 67 where it is held by its enlarged head 73 The wire 70 is then tensioned by the ratchet drum assembly 68 until the body 60 is firmly clamped to th corner as shown in Figure 9. The abutment 72 is formed with a cylindrical central portion not shown around which the wire 70 runs.To allow its withdrawal on release of the body the abutment is provided with a length of cord not shown which is brought up the cavity as the wall is built This can be used to tie the reference member back into its vertical position, if it should be forced out by the wall. The position of reference member 16 is initially adjusted by knobs 65 operating adjustment screws 63, which engage the member above and below pivots 61, 62. Figure 10 shows a reference member which can be used with the clamps described above. The reference member, generally indicated at 16, comprises an elongate straight sided hollow body 52 dimensioned to be received in the recess 26 or aperture 33. The body is generally square in cross section and has two cruciform spring slips 53 wedged therein, such that the arms of the clips engage in respective corners of the body. A plumb line 54 extends between the centre of the clips and passes through an aperture not shown in each clip. The plumb line is longer than the distance between the clips and is dimensioned to pass freely through the apertures. The ends of the line are enlarged at 55 to prevent those ends passing through their respective apertures.A weight 56 is attached to each end of the plumb line within the confines of the body lying between the clips 53. A window 57 is formed in the body 52 adjacent to but inward of each weight 56. A reference mark 58, such as a notch, is marked adjacent the window on the centre line of the body 52. In use the reference member 16 can be placed within the clamp, either way up, and when the plumb line 54 aligns with the mark 58 at the bottom window 57 the reference member extends vertically. The extra length of the plumb line allows it to tilt freely out of the vertical position, when the reference member is not vertical, but the use of a clip 53 at either end, together with the englarged ends 55 preven the line falling back into the body and maintains the line always in extension. It will be appreciated that the device will operate perfectly well if there is only one weight 56 and one window 57, provided that the device is always used with the weight lowermostO The windows 57 may be circular and if glazed, eOg. by perspex, may bear the reference mark. It will be appreciated that once a wall has been built up to the top of the reference member, the clamp then can be attached to the wall and the height of the wall increased. In a simpler form the clamp may be constituted by one or more tightenable bands, which can grip the end of a spirit level or the like, and which carry suckers or other suitable releasable attachment mechanisms or devices, whereby the level can be attached to a wall.
