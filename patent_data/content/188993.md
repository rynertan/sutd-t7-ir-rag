# Multiple disc type filters.

## Abstract
A filter including a housing 2 having an inlet 4 connectable to an upstream pipe, and an outlet 6 connectable to a downstream pipe and a stack of discs 20 disposed within the housing 2 for separating solid particles from a fluid flowing between the discs 20 from the upstream side of said stack to the downstream side thereof. The filter discs 20 have a large surface area of their side faces formed with grooves and a spacer member 22 interposed between each pair of adjacent filter discs 20 , the spacer members 20 having surfaces contacting only a portion of the grooved faces of the filter discs 20 on the upstream side of the stack not contacted by the spacer members 22 to thereby form compartments 24 on the upstream side of the stack for accumulation of solid particles which settle in the grooves, edge filtering passageways along the upstream edges of the spacer members 22 in contact with the grooved faces of the filter discs 20 , which passageways define the size of particles separated by the filter and further filtering passageways of large surface area in the compartments 24 , these latter passageways extending between the particles settling in the grooves in the compartments 24 and through the grooves to the downstream side of the stack.
