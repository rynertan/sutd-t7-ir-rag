# An apparatus for unhooking and transferring hung articles, in particular cuts of meat.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for unhooking and transferring hung articles, in particular cuts of meat hung on conventional hooks, from haulage vehicles, for instance, to sorting and warehousing installations. It is characterised by the fact that it comprises a particular type of gripping mechanism 22 , capable of being moved in three respective ly orthogonal directions, and designed to withdraw the the said articles 2 from the hooks 3 whereon they were hung at the outset, to hold them thus, and to transfer and re hang them upon further hooks 6 . The said gripping mechanism 22 in its turn comprises two symmetrically arranged and appropriately shaped gripping elements, movable with re spect to each other from a first working position in which they are disposed with, at least, their free extremities united by reciprocal contact of their opposed surfaces, to a second working position in which the same elements are brought to that minimum reciprocal distance which allows the guided insertion therebetween of one of the said hooks, and vice versa.
