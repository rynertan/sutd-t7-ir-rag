# Xerographic copier including hot roll fuser.

## Abstract
In a xerographic copier employing a hot roll fuser and adapted to produce copies on various sizes of copy paper, the rolls of the fuser must be of a length to accommodate the largest copy sheet. Accordingly, when small sheets are employed, the total surfaces of the rolls are not used. The hot roll has a surface considerably softer than the back up roll and is, therefore, subject to wear in use. With copy paper of differing dimensions, and referenced to one end of the rolls, uneven wear is caused to the hot roll as portions of the opposite end do not consistently contact copy sheets being fused. This wear is minimised by mounting the hot roll 14 in a frame 152 which is removable from the fuser unit to permit end to end reversal of the hot roll 14 .
