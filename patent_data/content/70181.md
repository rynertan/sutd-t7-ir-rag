## Description
Silver halide light sensitive color photographic materialThis invention relates to a silver halide lightsensitive color photographic material, and more particularly to a silver halide light sensitive color photographic material which is excellent in sharpness of the dye image formed.Generally, a silver halide light sensitive color photographic material comprises a plurality of light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers uniformly applied on a support made of for example cellulose triacetate, polyethylene terephthalate or the like. Each of these emulsion layers has a dry film thickness of several microns and exhibits different color sensitivity. These light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers contain many silver halide grains which have a grain size approximately corresponding to the wavelength of visible ray and exhibit various crystal habits, and which are dispersed in a hydrophilic colloid exhibiting a refractive index smaller than that of a silver halide, such as gelatin.As already known in this field, when a visible ray is applied perpendicularly to the surface of a light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer of this type, the visible ray is scattered by the silver halide grains in the layer. This phenomenon is interpreted to occur because the grain size is approximately equal to the wavelength of the visible ray and because the refractive indices of the grains and the binder are different from each other. The degree of the scattering differs according to the number of grains contained in the unit volume of the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, grain size, grain size distribution, difference between the refractive indices of the silver halide grains and the binder. Thus, even when a visible incident ray impinges upon the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer at right angles, it is scattered in the layer, adversely affecting the sharpness of the image formed therein.The above mentioned problem is aggravated when an image is magnification projected or enlarged in printing. As a result, the image becomes unsharp.For example, the contour of an edge image or details of a texture image become unsharp, and the quality of the dye image is affected detrimentally.Various methods have been proposed to relieve the deterioration in the image sharpness due to scattering of light.For example, as an effective method of improving image sharpness in the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, it has been proposed to minimize diffusion of scattered light in the direction parallel to the surface of the silver halide emulsion layer. For this purpose, the film thickness of the silver halide emulsion layer is minimized by reducing the proportion of silver halide grains with respect to gelatin in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, reducing the average crystal size of the silver halide grains in the lightsensitive silver halide emulsion layer used as the uppermost layer, or by decreasing the amount of the binder used in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion. However, these methods have serious drawbacks. Namely, sensitivity of an emulsion layer generally deteriorates when the grain sizes of silver halide grains are reduced.Further, if the amount of the binder contained in the emulsion layer is substantially reduced, the amount of the coupler which can be added to the emulsion layer also decreases, resulting in a low sensitivity of the emulsion.On the other hand, it is also known to apply a green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, which forms a magenta color forming dye image exhibiting a high relative luminosity, as the uppermost layer of the light sensitive color photographic material.However, this method also presents a serious problem with regard to the basic performance of the color light sensitive material. Namely, the uppermost layer of the green sensitive silver halide emulsion is also sensitive to the blue light region which is the sensitive region intrinsic to the silver halide emulsion. This fact is unfavorable to the greensensitive silver halide. Normally, it is desirable that only the blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer be sensitive to blue light. This phenomenon of the green sensitive silver halide emulsion results in fatal defects in the color reproduction of the color photosensitive material.An object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide light sensitive color photographic material exhibiting an improved sharpness of the dye image formed therein.Namely, the present invention relates to a silver halide light sensitive color photographic material comprising blue sensitive, green sensitive, and redsensitive negative type light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers provided on a support, characterized in that at least 80 of silver halide grains contained in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer farthest from said support or in the greensensitive silver halide emulsion layer are constituted by regular crystal silver halide grains.The silver halide light sensitive color photographic material in accordance with the present invention exhibits an improved sharpness of the dye image formed therein.The term negative type light sensitive silver halide emulsion as used herein has a meaning opposite to the direct positive type silver halide emulsion.Namely, the negative type silver halide emulsion in the present invention means a silver halide emulsion which has the sensitive nuclei at the surfaces of the silver halide grains and which yields blackened silver in proportion to the lightness of the object when developed with a surface developing solution after the exposure.The silver halide light sensitive color photographic material in accordance with the present invention will hereinbelow be described in more detail.The regular crystal silver halide grains used in the silver halide light sensitive photographic material in accordance with the present invention means silver halide crystal grains having a regular form, in which the outer crystal habit essentially consists only of 1001 face and or 1111 face. Thus it is used as a concept opposite to the twinned crystal.Typical regular crystal silver halide grains in the present invention are those having a regular cubic, octahedral or tetradecahedral form. In the lightsensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing the regular crystal silver halide grains in accordance with the present invention, at least 80 of all silver halide grains contained therein are constituted by the regular crystal silver halide grains defined above.In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least 80 of the silver halide grains contained in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer located at the position farthest from the support are constituted by the regular crystal silver halide grains defined above. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least 80 of the silver halide grains contained in the light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, which is sensitive to green light, are constituted by the above mentioned regular crystal silver halide grains.In the present invention, when the above mentioned green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer is not located at the position farthest from the support, it is further preferable that at least 80 of the total silver halide grains contained in each of said green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer and said farthest ligii ensitive silver halide emulsion layer are constituted by the abovementioned regular crystal silver halide grains. In one of the most preferred embodiments of the present invention, at least 80 of the silver halide grains contained in all light sensitive silver halide emulsion layers constituting the silver halide lightsensitive color photographic material in accordance with the present invention are constituted by the regular crystal silver halide grains.The silver halide grains used in the silver halide light sensitive photographic material in accordance with the present invention may be prepared by the acid process, neutral process or ammonia process.It is also possible to prepare seed crystals by the acid process, and grow them up to the predetermined size by the ammonia process which gives a high growth rate. When growing the silver halide grains, it is desirable that the pH, EAg or the like in the reactor are controlled, and silver ions and halide ions are both poured simultaneously and sequentially and mixed in quantities matching the growth rate of silver halide crystals, as described for example in JapaneseProvisional Patent Publication No. 48521 1979, which is so called double jet method.In the preparation of the silver halide grains used in the present invention, ions of noble metals such as Ir, Rh, Pt and Au may be added in the course of the grain growth so as to include them in the interiors of the grains, or reduction sensitization nuclei may be formed in the interiors of the grains by using a low pAg atmosphere or an appropriate reducing agent.The silver halide emulsions used in the present invention may be adjusted to a pAg value or an ion concentration suitable for chemical sensitization by using an appropriate method after the growth of the silver halide grains is finished. For this purpose, for example, the aggregation method and the noodle water washing method as described inResearch Disclosure No. 17643 may be used.In the present invention, the regular crystal silver halide emulsion may be used without changing its crystal size distribution, or two or more regularcrystal emulsions having different average crystal sizes may be blended together to obtain a desired gradient of characteristic curve at an arbitrary point of time after the formation of grains. It is preferable, however, to blend them after the chemical ripening.The liÇhtfflensitive silver halide emulsion layer located at the position farthest from the support, or the green sensitive silver halide emulsion layer in the silver halide light sensitive color photographic material in accordance with the present invention may contain silver halide grains other than the regular crystals, for example twinnedcrystal silver halide grains, in an amount not exceeding 20 of the total grains contained in the layer. However, it is preferable that the content of silver halide grains other than the regular crystals be limited to 10 or less, and it is more preferable that the layer is substantially free from silver halide grains other than the regular crystals.In the regular crystal silver halide emulsion contained in the silver halide light sensitive color photographic material in accordance with the present invention, the cubic, octahedral and tetradecahedral crystal grains may be used alone or two or more thereof may be mixed in any proportions.However, it is preferable that the proportions of the octahedral grains and or tetradecahedral grains be larger than that of the cubic grains, and it is more preferable that the crystal grains be constituted only by octahedral grains and or tetradecahedral grains.In the present invention, there is no limitation regarding the composition of the silver halides in the silver halide emulsions, and a composition usually employed may be used. For example, in a negative emulsion for general photography, a composition containing silver bromide as the main constituent and optionally 12 mol or less of silver iodide and 10 mol or less of silver chloride is preferably used. On the other hand, for use in printing in which excellent developing characteristics are required and a relatively low sensitivity is permitted, silver chlorobromide emulsions, silver chloroiodobromide emulsions or the like containing silver chlorobromide or silver chloride as the main constituent may be used.When two or more emulsions having different average crystal sizes are used in combination in the present invention, it is preferable that each emulsion be chenucally sensitized in a manner suitable thereto.The chemical sensitization may be conducted by a known method such as sulfur sensitization, gold sensitization, selenium sensitization, and reduction sensitization.Two or more of these sensitization methods may be combined. The reaction rate differs according to the crystal size of the silver halide, and the respective emulsions cannot necessarily exhibit their maximum reaction rates if they are sensitized by the same method or after blended together instead of being individually sensitized.In the present invention, the sulfur sensitization may be conducted by using for example sodium thiosulfate, thiourea, allyl thiourea or the like. The gold sensitization can be conducted by using for example sodium chloroaurate, potassium aurothiocyanate or the like. It is also possible to conduct gold sulfur chemical sensitization by using at least one sulfur sensitizing agent and at least one gold sensitizing agent listed above. In this case, A ammonium thiocyanate or the like may further be added. In addition to the aforesaid chemical sensitization methods, the selenium sensitization method may also be applied for the silver halide emulsions used in the present invention. For this purpose, methods using selenourea, N,N dimethylselenourea or the like, as described for example in U.S. Patent Nos.1,574,944 and 3,591,385, Japanese Patent PublicationNos. 13849 1968 and 15748 1969 may be used.Further, it is possible to conduct reduction sensitization according to the conventional procedure.This can be done for example by the ripening in a low pAg atmosphere or by using an appropriate reducing agent or an electromagnetic wave such as light and y ray.In the silver halide light sensitive photographic material in accordance with the present invention, the two or more emulsions having different average crystal sizes may be applied as separate layers on the support or may be applied as one layer after mixing. The support used in this case may be of any known material for example a polyester film such as polyethylene terephthalate, a polyamide film, a polycarbonate film, a styrene film, baryta paper, or paper coated with a synthetic polymer.The silver halide light sensitive color photographic material in accordance with the present invention is particularly suitable as the negative type silver halide color photographic material for the purpose of taking a picture, which is required to exhibit a high sensitivity and a high image quality.The hydrophilic colloid used to disperse the silver halide grains therein in accordance with the present invention is most preferably gelatin. However, for the purpose of improving the binder characteristics, it is also possible to use for example gelatin derivatives, other natural hydrophilic colloids such as albumin, casein, agar, gum arabic, alginic acid and its derivatives e.g. salts, amides and esters thereof, starch and its derivatives, cellulose derivatives such as cellulose ethers, partially hydrolyzed cellulose acetate and carboxymethyl cellulose, and synthetic hydrophilic resins such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, homopolymers and copolymers of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid or their derivatives e.g. esters, amides and nitriles thereof, and vinyl polymers e.g. vinyl ethers and vinyl esters.The silver halide emulsions used in the silver halide light sensitive photographic material in accordance with the present invention may also contain stabilizers and fog restrainers as described for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,444,607, 2,716,062, 3,512,982, and 3,342,596, German Patent Nos. 1,189,380, 205,862 and 211,841, Japanese Patent Publication Nos.4183 1968 and 2825 1964, and Japanese ProvisionalPatent Publication Nos. 22626 1975 and 25218 1975.Examples of particularly preferable compounds used for this purpose are 5,6 trimethylene 7 hydroxy 8triazolo l,5 a pyrimidine, 5,6 tetramethylene 7 hydroxy 8 triazolo l,S a pyrimidine, 5 methyl 7 hydroxy 8 triazolo 1,5 a pyrimidine, 7 hydroxy 8triazolo l,5 a pyrimidine, gallates such as isoamyl gallate, dodecyl gallate, propyl gallate and sodium gallate, mercaptans such as 1 phenyl 5 mercapto tetrazole and 2 mercaptobenzothiazole, benzotriazoles such as 5 bromobenzotriazole and 4 methylbenzotriazole, and benzoimidazoles such as 6 nitrobenzoimidazole.The silver halide emulsions in the present invention may be subjected to the spectral sensitization by using known spectral sensitizing dyes such as cyanine dye and merocyanine dye according to the conventional procedure. For example, for the regular region, it is possible to use sensitizing dyes as described inJapanese Provisional Patent Publication Nos. 2756 1980 and 14743 1980. For the ortho region, the sensitizing dyes as described in Japanese Provisional PatentPublication Nos. 56425 1973 and 31228 1976, andJapanese Patent Publication No. 25379 1972 may be used. These dyes may be used alone or in combination with one another. Further, the spectral sensitization for the long wavelength range can be conducted by using a cyanine dye having a longer methine group as described in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 126140 1976.It is also possible to conduct the supersensitization by use of a combination of dyes.The coating composition for the silver halide photosensitive material in accordance with the present invention may contain photographic hardeners usually used in this field such as for example aldehydes, aziridines as described for example in PB Report 19,921, U.S. Patent Nos. 2,950,197, 2,964t404, 2,983,611 and 3,271,175, Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 40898 1971 and Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 91315 1975, isoxazoles as described e.g.in U.S. Patent No. 331,609, epoxy compounds as described e.g. in U.S. Patent No. 3,047,394, WestGerman Patent No. 1,085,663, British Patent No.1,033,518 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 35495 1973, vinyl sulfones as described e.g. in PB Report 19,920, West German Patent No. 1,100,942, BritishPatent No. 1,251,091, Japanese Patent Publication No. 13563 1974,Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 528 1975, U.S. PatentNos. 353,964 and 3,490,911, acryloyls as described e.g. in U.S. Patent No.4,039,520 and U.S. Patent No.3,640,720, carbodiimides as described e.g. in U.S.Patent No. 2,938,892, Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 38715 1971 and Japanese Provisional PatentPublication No. 107278 1975, other hardeners such as maleimides, acetylenes, methane sulfonates, triazines and high molecular hardeners. Further, the coating composition in accordance with the present invention may contain thickening agents as described e.g. in U.S. Patent No. 3,167,410 and Belgian PatentNo. 558,143, gelatin plasticizers such as polyols as described e.g. in U.S. Patent No. 2,960,404, JapanesePatent Publication 4939 1968 and Japanese ProvisionalPatent Publication No. 63715 1973, and latices as described e.g. in U.S. Patent No. 766,976, FrenchPatent No. 1,395,544 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 43125 1973, and matting agents as described e.g. in British Patent No. 1,221,980.The composition for the silver halide lightsensitive photographic material in accordance with the present invention may contain a desired auxiliary such as saponin or a sulfosuccinic acid surface active agent as described e.g. in BritishPatent No. 548,532 and Japanese Provisional Patent PublicationNo. 46733 1974 or an anionic surface active agent as described e.g. in Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 18156 1968, U.S. Patent No. 3,514,293, FrenchPatent No. 2,025,688 and Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 10247 1968.In the present invention, dyes may be used in the layer which is below the emulsion layers in accordance with the present invention and which contacts the support. Further, for the purpose of improving image sharpness or reducing fog due to safelight, dyes may be added to the protective layer and or the emulsion layers in accordance with the present invention and or the non photosensitive layer contacting the emulsion layer in accordance with the present invention. For this purpose, any of dyes known for this purpose may be used. The emulsions in accordance with the present invention may be applied to the color light sensitive material by using the technology and materials which are usually used for general color lightsensitive materials and the false color lightsensitive materials as described in Imaging No.18 19 1976 .

These couplers may be incorporated into the silver halide color lightsensitive photographic material according to various procedures known for such couplers.The silver halide light sensitive photographic material in accordance with the present invention can be developed by the known methods usually employed. The bleach developing solution may be a usually employed developing solution containing e.g.hydroquinone, l phenyl 3 pyrazolidone, N methyl paminophenol or p phenylenediamine alone or in the form of a combination of two or more thereof. It is also possible to use other additives usually employed. In case the light sensitive material is used for color photographic purpose, it can be colordeveloped by usual color development method. A developing solution containing an aldehyde hardener can also be used for the silver halide light sensitive material in accordance with the present invention. For example, it is possible to use developing solution known in the field of photography containing dialdehydes such as maleic dialdehyde, glutaric dialdehyde or their salts with sodium bisulfite.The present invention will hereinafter be illustrated in further detail by the following non limitative examples.Example 1Primitive emulsions 1, 2, 3 and 4 were prepared as described below.
