# STAGGERED GROUND PLANE MICROSTRIP TRANSMISSION LINE

## Abstract
A microstrip transmission line comprises a plurality of signal carrying lines disposed along a dielectric ribbon and separated by a predetermined spacing. Ground plane con ductors are disposed on the opposite side of the ribbon in staggered relation to the signal carrying lines such that the ground plane conductors occupy spaces corresponding to the gaps between adjacent signal carrying lines. This arrangement lowers the capacitance and raises the impe dance of the transmission line while maintaining high signal line density.
