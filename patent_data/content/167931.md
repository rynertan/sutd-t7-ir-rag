## Description
The present invention relates to elongated generally rectangular pads as described in the preambles of claims 1 and 3. These pads are used as disposable absorbent garments adapted to receive discharge from the body. The proposed pads may be used for absorbtion of bodily exudate such as menstrual fluid or urine. A pad of this type is disclosed in EP A 0 091 412. The known absorbent pad has elasticized side margins formed by at least the fluid impermeable outer layer extending beyond the two longitudinal lateral edges of the absorbent layer. Thus, the absorbent layer is smaller than the pad as a whole. The elastic members are attached to the side margins distant from the absorbent layer and along its entire length, although their attachment to only the mid portions is preferred. The elastic members are arranged to be effective for raising the side margins laterally above the absorbent layer when allowed to relax. Additionally, they are able to bend the absorbent layer in longitudinally direction. In the lateral direction, however, the absorbent layer remains flat. EP A 0 098 512 describes an absorbent pad comprising an hourglass shaped absorbent layer and a impermeable outer sheet widely extending beyond both longitudinal side edges of the absorbent layer. The extending pads of the outer sheet are folded over the top surface of the absorbent layer and are fixed to the rearward pad of the outer sheet at the smaller sides of the pad. The edges of the folded over parts of the outer layer contain the elastic members, thus arranging the elastic members offset and between the longitudinal sides of the pad. When allowed to relax the elastic members will raise the folded over parts and will additionally bend the absorbent layer in longitudinal direction. In lateral direction the absorbent layer remains flat. EP A 0 067 916 discloses a diaper having hourglass shaped backing and facing sheets, and an absorbent layer enclosed therebetween. The diaper has an elastic leg band area. The location, dimensioning and further functions of the elastic are not described. When comparing the figures, it could be seen that the side margins are intended to enclose the legs of the baby when the diaper is worn, thereby providing a tight fit around the legs for preventing leakage. When used for this purpose, the elastic means in connection with a hourglass shaped diaper has to cause the elasticized side margins to lay flat on the skin around the baby s legs, which might be achieved by raised side margins but not by an elastic means causing the absorbent layer itself to form a bowed trough with its lateral sides being above the bottom. US A 4 050 462 describes a diaper of full or half hourglass shape with elastic means arranged so as to form pleats extending in lateral direction across the complete width of the diaper. The elastic means of this diaper are not arranged to bend the absorbent pad in any direction. DE A 1 815 857 discloses a sanitary napkin enclosing a ladder shaped elastic means adapted to be bent laterally by the pressure caused by the legs to the napkin. When allowed to relax the elastic means hold the napkin flat so that the napkin can lose its proper fit unintentionally and easily during any movement of the user. In order to prevent the elastic means to return the napkin to its flat configuration, a sheet of liquid soluble material cross braces the upwardly extending sides. Since this sheet is intended to be destroyed during use, the problem of dislocation of the napkin during movement of the user is not solved. In addition, the napkin is not bend longitudinally which will cause further problems with respect to an unsightable seat under the garment of the user. Therefore, there remains a need for an absorbent pad to be used as a disposable absorbent garment of a proper fit to be worn by adults also, which is comfortable and does not distort the target area. Alternative embodiments of a pad fulfilling this need are described in claims 1 and 3. According to the present invention, a comfortable incontinent and catamenial pad is provided which is discrete, highly absorbent and non leaking even during activities of the user. In addition, the invention provides a low cost pad. Furthermore developments of the invention are described in the sub claims. Embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the figures, wherein The invention has numerous advantages over the prior incontinent pads and previous catamenial pads. The pad of the invention is comfortable. The pad of the invention also will have less tendency to crease and be distorted when it is worn. Therefore, it will remain in the target area and therefore is less likely to leak. Further, previous garments for mild urinary incontinence were bulky, unsightly, and had a greater tendency to leak. The pad of the invention is also somewhat easier to form in that folding of the device is not necessary and attachment and suspension devices are not necessary or are very simple. These and other advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description below. Figure 1 illustrates a pad in accordance with the invention in extended position. The pad has elasticized areas 12 and 14 extending along substantially the entire length of the longer sides of the rectangular pad 10. The pad has a pervious liner material 16. The impervious backing, not visible, is folded over to form baffles 18 and 20 on the body side of pad 10. The cross sectional view of Figure 2 shows the baffles 18 and 20 overlapping the pervious body side liner 16. The backing sheet 24 is composed of a fabric layer 28 that is on the outer surface and an inner impervious layer 26 from an integral sheet. The baffles 18 and 20 are adhesively connected to the pervious sheet 16 at 36 and 38. The cloth like outer surface 28 of the baffles 18 and 20 is particularly desirable as the baffles will be in contact with the skin and the cloth like outer surface will be less likely to cause abrasion, skin reddening and other irritation to discomfort the wearer. The pad has an interior absorbent 22 that is surrounded by the impervious member 24 at the sides and back. The elastic members 30 and 32 serve to gather the elasticized edges of the garment and cause it to assume the trough like configuration. As illustrated in Figure 3 the garment will, when the elastic is relaxed, assume a bowed, trough like configuration with upturned ends 40 and 42. The bottom 44 of the trough will be about one inch 2,54cm below the sides of the trough 46 and 48. As is apparent from Figure 3 the bowed trough like shape will readily conform to the pubic area of a woman. Further, when it is thus conformed it will not have a tendency to wrinkle in the middle so as to distort target area. Further, as the pad 10 assumes a trough like configuration, the depressed center portion will not have a tendency to contact and irritate the vulva or other sensitive portions of the perineal region of the wearer. Further, while described primarily as a woman s product, it is apparent that in the larger sizes that it is suitable for use by a male for light to moderate urinary incontinence problems. As is apparent from Figures 1 through 3, the device also may be formed from four simple rectangular pieces of material. The impervious liner, absorbent member, and outer sheet that forms the backing and baffles are all rectangular. Further, the elastic is placed onto the garment in straight lines for the entire distance, thereby simplifying the control of the adhesion of the elastic to the garment. The intermittent adhesion of elastics to diapers and other incontinent garments has been a complicating factor in their manufacture and continuous adhesion is a manufacturing advantage. Further, the production of a garment that does not require folding after formation may also be an advantage. The garments of the invention nest very well to form stacks for shipping, boxing, and storing. Figure 4 is a cross section along line 44 of Figure 3 illustrating the trough like configuration of the garment 10. When in relaxed configuration the garment forms a trough like structure at the bottom 44. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate an alternate garment formed in accordance with the convention. The garment of Figure 5 viewed in extended condition has elastic 62 and 64 extending substantially from one end of pad 60 to points 66 and 65 about two thirds of the way toward the other end. These elastics as viewed in Figure 6 cause the pad 60 to assume a configuration in the relaxed position generally corresponding to a j. The j pad has a lower portion having a trough like configuration with a bottom 68 and sides 70 and 72. The pad also has baffles 61 and 63 to aid in the prevention of leaking from the sides of the pad. The nonelasticized part 74 may be worn towards the back of the garment over the buttocks to aid in prevention of leaking of the garment in use. The nonelastized parts 74 will make less likely the leaking of urine when the wearer is seated. The j shaped garment has the advantage that the elasticized trough like portion 68 will conform to the perineal area and not be deformed in such a manner to cause leaking during movement of the wearer. The nonelastized portion 74 extends upward and aids in holding of the device in place while also providing additional absorption capacity and reducing the tendency to leak when the wearer is sitting. The impervious backing sheet member of the invention may be made of any suitable material that does not allow the passage of aqueous liquids. Typical of such material are sheets of polyethylene, polypropylene and other polymer and copolymer materials. A preferred material is a sheet formed by extrusion of polyethylene onto a spunbonded fabric material. The spunbonded material is formed by spinning of fine continuous filaments of polypropylene onto a moving belt. The coextruded sheet is formed by extrusion of a very thin layer of polyethylene polymer onto the spunbonded fabric. This material is very light in weight and low in cost as the polymer use is quite low. Further, in the preferred construction the backing sheet is folded onto the body side at the edges to form baffles. The baffles being in contact with the skin are more comfortable with the cloth being exposed rather than the polymer sheet. The polymer sheet, without a cloth like surface, when contacting the skin is more likely to cause reddening, abrasion, and deterioration of the skin. However, the plain polymer sheet could be used if a lower cost product is desired. The absorbent material may be any of many well known absorbents. Typical of such absorbent material is fluff formed of divellicated wood fibers. A preferred absorbent is coform fabric absorbent sheets. Coform is an air formed combination of divellicated wood fibers and meltblown polymer, normally polypropylene. This material is found to have high integrity and absorbency when present in a thin pad. The formation of coform is disclosed in U.S. 4,100,324 Anderson et al. that is hereby incorporated by reference. The use of a coform material also containing superabsorbent, such as disclosed in UK Patent Pub. 2,113,731 of August 10, 1983, is particularly desirable in view of its light weight and thinness of the superabsorbent containing coform in combination with its very high absorbency. The garment of the invention may be designed to hold any desired amount of fluid by selection of appropriate amounts and types of absorbents. It is preferred for mild incontinence use that the pad be able to rapidly absorb and retain between about 20 and about 60 cm³ of aqueous fluid. Mild incontinence, suitable for the use of the pad of the invention, generally refers to those persons having a stress incontinence where quantities of urine may be lost when an activity such as sneezing or laughing is performed and also to those persons with a more or less constant dribble of urine. A pad with the specified absorbency is suitable for such incontinence problems. The pervious liner material may be of any known materials for absorbent pad use that are nonirritating to the skin of the wearer and will easily pass fluids but not absorb them. Typical of such material are perforated polymer sheets, tissue, and nonwoven fabrics. The preferred material is spunbonded polypropylene fabric sheet. In its most preferred form the spunbonded polypropylene is treated with a wetting agent or surfactant to make it hydrophylic and also is bonded to a coform layer. The bonding may be achieved by adhesive connection, by embossing or ultrasonics, or in a most preferred form the spunbonded polypropylene sheet is used as a forming layer onto which the coform material is applied in an air stream. Adhesion of the covering sheet to the coform aids in transfer of liquid through the sheet to the absorbent. However, the pad of the invention does not require the pervious liner to be bonded to the absorbent material. The pervious liner may be wrapped around the impervious backing material and absorbent or may be glued on top of baffles 18 in some methods of construction of the pad. Bonding of the permeable liner to the absorbent is preferred as it will lower the leakage rate of the pads as urine is less likely to run off. The generally rectangular elasticized pad of the invention may be of any suitable dimensions. However, it has been found that there are certain dimensions that are preferred in forming a pad that is comfortable and covers enough of the pubic region to adequately absorb fluids and not be subject to displacement during movement. The preferred length of the backing sheet material is a rectangular sheet of a length of between about 8 and 14 inches 20,32 and 35,56cm . The elastic is placed on the sheet with a degree of stretch such that after the elastic is relaxed the finished garment will have a length when gently flattened of between about 80 and about 90 percent of the original length of the sheet prior to application of the elastic or between about 6.4 and about 12.6 inches 16,26 and 32cm . The width of the pad generally corresponds to about the width of the absorbent material and is about 30 percent of the original length of the rectangular sheet or between about 2.4 to about 4.2 inches 6,1 to 10,67cm . The particularly preferred pad has an original length of about 10 inches 25,4cm and original absorbent width of about 3 inches 7,62cm . This pad is originally formed from an impervious sheet that is about 4.5 inches 11,43cm wide by about 10 inches 25,4cm long with about three fourths inch 3 4 1,9cm to be folded over on each edge to form the edges and also form an inside baffle. This size sheet is found to produce a pad that is suitable for mild urinary incontinence or catamenial use for an average sized woman with comfort and effectiveness. The placement of the elastic in the pads of the invention generally will be at the sides of the absorbent material as indicated in Figure 2. However, it is also possible that the elastic could be placed on the body side of the absorbent pad by adhering the adhesive to the underside of the baffles. However, it is believed that the pad is more comfortable if the elastic is on the interior wall of the outermost edge of the backing material as illustrated in Figure 2. It is also possible that the elastic members may be placed beneath the outer edges of the absorbent material and adhered to the backing material in that area either on the interior or exterior of the pad. The amount of elastic placed onto the sides of the pad may be any necessary amount that will cause the formation of the pad into the desired bowed trough configuration or the j configuration. It is generally necessary for the invention that the elastic be adhered beginning at one end of the pad and extending to a point at least about two thirds of the way toward the other end creating an effective elasticized area of at least about two thirds of the opposing long edges of the rectangular pad. The pad may be held in place by the wearer either by a tight fitting garment or by placing of adhesive lines or areas on the exterior facing of the pad. The adhesive will adhere to the underwear of the wearer. It is also possible that the pad could be held in place by belts or straps. The preferred method is to have the pad held by small areas of adhesive on the ends of the pad such as adhesive areas 7 and 9 of pad 10 of Figure 1. While the pad of the invention has been described primarily for catamenial and incontinence uses, the pad also could serve as a bandage or wound dressing. It is considered as particularly well suited for use as a bandage on elbows or knees. The pad if used for a bandage, particularly for the adult knee, may have a somewhat longer length dimension, and a width of less than about 30 of the length. The trough shaped pad finds utility as a dressing, but the size may need to be varied from the incontinence sizes depending on the use of the dressing. The foregoing specification and drawings are intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive. Other variations and rearrangements of the pad of the invention are possible without departing from spirit of the invention which is intended to be limited only by the breadth of the claims attached hereto.
