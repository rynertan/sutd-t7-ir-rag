# Product for controlled triglyceride nutrition of hypercatabolic mammals.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a composition for enhancing protein anabolism in an hypercatabolic mammal. According to the invention nutritionally sufficient sources for amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids are parenterally administered to the mammal, the lipids comprising a control led triglyceride source which, on hydrolysis, yields both long chain fatty acids and medium chain fatty acids, preferably about 20 to 80 long chain fatty acids and about 80 to 20 medium chain fatty acids. In one embodiment, the composi tion has the additional benefit of being capable of providing more than 60 of the total caloric requirements of the mam mal via the lipid source without immunological impairment of the reticuloendothelial system of the mammal.
