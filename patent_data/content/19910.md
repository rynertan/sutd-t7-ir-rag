# A method for manufacturing a low density synthetic resin foamed body.

## Abstract
A low density synthetic resin foamed body and a manufacturing method therefore which method is characterized by the steps of filling a mixture of 100 parts by weight of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, 20 80 parts by weight of a foaming agent, and 1.0 5.0 parts by weight of a crosslinking agent in a mold closing the mold with a lid, heating the mold to form a foamed body, cooling the foamed body as it is kept in the mold, and opening the lid of the mold.
