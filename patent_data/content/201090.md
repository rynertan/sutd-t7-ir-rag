# Improved polyolefin particles and process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
Polyolefin particles having a halogenated surface re gion, which are prepared by irradiating ultraviolet rays to an aqueous dispersion of polyolefin particles in the pre sence of a halogen gas. The polyolefin particles having a halogenated surface region have an improved property of retaining volatile blowing agents and can provide expand able particles having an improved storability in the open state.
