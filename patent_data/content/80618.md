# ELECTROSTATIC COALESCING DEVICE

## Abstract
The electrodes between which AC and DC electrostatic fields are sustained in a liquid mixture are connected to ground potential through rectifiers arranged to maintain the strength of the DC electrostatic field as the dielectric strength of the liquid mixture decreases.
