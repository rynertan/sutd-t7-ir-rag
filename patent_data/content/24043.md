# APPARATUS FOR CONVERTING ROTARY MOTION TO LINEAR MOTION

## Abstract
The invention concerns an apparatus for conversion of rotary into linear motion, comprising a screw 1,21 with exterior thread and disposed hereupon a nut 2,22 with interior thread or an equivalent member. These two present between themselves a radial play. The screw 1,21 and nut 2,22 are rotatably carried in a frame 3,23 so that the bearing housing 7,8,28 either of the screw or of the nut has been made movable in radial direction and said housing is loaded with an adjustable spring 19,20,30 . The nut 1,21 and screw 2,22 will then assume a mutually eccentric position. By rotat ing the screw 1,21 or the nut 2,22 a rolling motion between these is accomplished. The pitch of the thread will then cause a relative longitudinal movement between the screw 1,21 and the nut 2,22 . When the longitudinal movement is braked with an axial force Fr , the eccentricity caused by the spring 19,20,30 is either partly or totally canceled. The longitudinal movement will then slowdown accordingly or entirely cease despite continued rotary motion.
