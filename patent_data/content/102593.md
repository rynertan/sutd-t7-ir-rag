# FILTER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A filter system particularly adapted to remove particu late aerosol and vapor contamination from air comprising, according to a preferred embodiment, an outer shell having a contaminated air inlet cap connected to one end and a clean air outlet cap connected to the other end, and a plurality of filter units mounted axially in the shell, each of such units comprising two containers, one of the containers having a particle aerosol filter element therein such as paper, and the other of the containers having a vapor filter element therein, such as charcoal, the two containers of each filter unit being positioned in contiguous relation. A vapor pas sage is provided from one container to the other container of each unit and an annulus is provided between the outer periphery of the containers and the inner surface of the shell. A plurality of elongated inlet conduits is provided in the annulus, each of the respective conduits defining an inlet passage to the one container of each of the filter units, and a plurality of elongated outlet conduits is provided in the annulus, each of the outlet conduits defining an outlet passage from the other container of each of the filter units. The inlet conduits communicate with the inlet cap and the outlet conduits communicate with the outlet cap, In opera tion, contaminated air flows through the inlet cap and through the inlet conduits to the particle aerosol filter element of the respective filter units, then through the vapor filter element thereof, the contaminated air then passing through the outlet conduits and discharged through the outlet cap, thereby permitting parallel flow of contaminated air from the inlet cap through the respective filter units with discharge of clean air from the outlet cap.
