# Foundry aggregate binder compositions and their use.

## Abstract
Resin binder compositions for foundry sand molds and cores which comprise a solution in an inert solvent of a polyol component comprising a phenol ketone or thiophenol ketone resin and an organic polyisocyanate, optionally with a reac tive solvent and a cross linking agent. The binder composition cures rapidly at ambient temperature in the presence of a tertiary amine curing agent to provide strong foundry molds or cores. Polyether polyols may also be incorporated in the polyol component of the binder composition.
