# Doppler radar system.

## Abstract
In a Doppler radar system any one received signal contains components having different Doppler frequencies. This is because the received signal is derived from re flections off a range of different positions within the beam width of the system. It is often only that frequency component which is derived from a reflection along the boresight of the system which is of interest. The components of the received signals are derived from reflections along the boresight of the system by ana lysing each of two signals 22, 22 received at different times, into components having different Doppler shifts. Values are then calculated 29 of the relative strengths of components of the two signals derived from reflections off the same position. These relative strength values are not greatly affected by variations in the reflection properties of the surface and can be used to determine accurately the frequency components of the signals derived from the boresight.
