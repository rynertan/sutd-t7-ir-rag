## Description
The present invention refers to a metal ion adsorbent.It is known per see that by introducing a chelate forming group into a polymer, such as for instance polystyrene, there is obtained an adsorb t for bivalent or multivalent metal ions. Such a thelate adsorbent usually binds the metal ion stronger and more selectively than the usual, non chelating ion exchangers.It is furthermore known per see that a cross linked polymer with chelate forming groups which are charged with metal ions such as bivalent copper or zinc could be used for adsorption of substances which coordinate with these metal ions. Chromatography based on this principle has been denoted ligand exchange chromato graphy F. Heifferich, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 84 1962 3242 . Ligands such as water, buffer ions etc. could be exchanged for the adsorbing substances.Also high molecular substances, such as proteins could be adsorbed to the metal ions fixed in the matrix. This embodiment of the chromatographic procedure has been denoted metal chelate affinity chromatography J. Porath et al., Nature 258 1975 598 .The phenomenon metal chelate adsorption could also be used in batch procedures where a solution containing substances having an affinity to the polymer attached metal is brought in contact with the metal i.e. suspended in the solution . After the adsorption the gel is removed and washed whereafter material adsorbed can be diluted by means of changing the composition of the medium change of pH, change of salt or by means of introduction of a chelating substance . The metal chelate adsorption could also be used for immobilizing proteins, such as enzymes, antibodies and antigens. In adsorption desorption procedures including biopolymers such as protein or nucleic acids, an hydrophil matrix has been used to which a chelate forming group has been bound covalently. It is important that the gel matrix is hydrophil as one would otherwise obtain a strong mutual effect between the protein and the matrix substance in a water solution 11hydrofob adsorption . The selectiveness and specific character of the adsorption is not achieved in strong hydrofob adsorption and the product will not be useful for protein and nucleic acid purification.In order to obtain an optimal function the metal ion should be bound so heavily to the carrying polymer matrix that it is not desorbed released under the conditions useful to carry out the adsorption desorption procedures in a batch or at chromatography. Usually, these procedures are performed in the temperature range 0 0 40 and within a pH range of pH 3 10. The metal ion shall not be removed from the polymer by substances which are normally contained in the solutions or extracts which are subject to the process. The extracts from organisms often contain ammonium, amines, amino acids or other metal coordinating substances. The metal is not removed by these substances from an ideal chelate adsorber.On the other hand, the metal ion has to have a certain residual affinity so that proteins and the above mentioned substances can coordinate with the metal without removing the metal from the polymer attached ligands . Metal ions like zinc, iron, cobalt etc. usually coodinate with 6 ligands. If all the ligands are fixed into the matrix there is no residual affinity for ligands containing substances of a lower metal affinity than that of the polymer fixating ligands in the surrounding solution the metal ions are coordinately saturated with strong ligands. If, however, many free coordination positions are available the metal ion often is too loosely polymer bound and is removed from the gel simultaneously with the adsorbed protein at the desorption. Furthermore, the adsorbentis less well defined considering the adsorption properties of the metal chelate group.Different metal chelate groups get different contents of the ligands adsorbed from the solution due to different steric surrounding .The group hitherto normally used is the iminodiacetate groupEMI3.1 This group together with a copper ion forms the following chelateEMI3.2 This group gives the cupper 3 polymer bound and 3 free ligands.The following group has also been used with Sephadex as a carrying polymer matrix EMI3.3 see J. Porath, J. Chromatogr 159 1978 p. 23 .Here 7 metal coordinating atoms are present 2N and 50 from the carboxyles. In accordance with the dis icns above this number of ligands is unsuitably high. A group according to this formula could form a metal ion for instance Cu 2 a but when this is the case a further metal ion can be formed and this second metal ion b EMI4.1 The difference is obvious. The metal ion a is more strongly bound to the adsorbing element than the metal ion b . On the other hand, 4 free coordinating positions are available at b but only one at a which implies that b ties the ligand substances in a solution stronger.An adsorbing means having so many ligands atoms for each metal binding group will therefore be relatively heterogeneous.It is an object of the present invention to provide a metal ion adsorbent having chelating groups each of which having a suitable number of ligands and a suitable distribution of these ligands. The metal ion adsorbent according to the invention furthermore have optimized properties for metal chelate adsorption chromatography where the metal is or could be hexacoordinated. The adsorbent according to the invention is characterized by the fact that each group contains 5 coordinated atoms out of which 2 are aliphatically or alicyclically bound nitrogen atoms and 3 are oxygen atoms of carboxylic groups. In the absorbent according to the invention the nitrogen atoms are separated by an ethylene bridge to which in addition to nitrogen hydrogen or a lower lic group or alicyclically bound carbon is bound.One of the nitrogen atoms is furthermore bound to the polymer and to an a carboxy a alkylmethyl group or a carboxy methyl group and to the other nitrogen atom two such groups are bound, thus EMI5.1 In this structure the metal binding group of the adsorbent structurewise ressembles ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid EDTA . It is a characteristics of a group in an adsorbent according to the invention that a hexacoordinated metal atom at least theoretically can form 4 5 armed rings each of which contains a metal and nitrogen and leaves one coordination position free for interaction with a ligand substance inthe solution. If R H one will thus obtain EMI5.2 The most ideal adsorbent is obtained if R H but also ifR CH3 or R C2H5 useful adsorbents are obtained. A further variety of the product having the required characteristics is the following EMI5.3 where R could be hydrogen or a lower alkyl, preferably hydrogen. This variety II is more hydrofobic than I in the cases where R H , this drawback however being compensated by a higher metal complex stability. The product in both its varieties will however generate very strong complexes with bivalent or threevalent metal ions, i.e. these ions are efficiently adsorbed, especially in a pH exceeding 7.The substance according to the invention is thus an ion exchanger but differs from a non chelating ion exchanger in its ability to find metals having a coordination number 2. 2. This difference is especially important if the coordination number is above 4. Consequently, a much lower competition from univalent cations is obtained. Cadmium, cobalt, nickel, zinc, iron etc. are strongly adsorbedeven in the presence of high concentrations of e.g. 4 M NaCl.Ammonium salts, amines, aminoacids such as glycine etc.form complexes with metals such as copper but an adsorbent according to the invention in the presence of these substances binds transfer metals and other multivalent metals stronger than conventional ion exchangers. In the neutral pH area zinc and copper ions could thus be fixed so strongly in a layer of the product according to the invention that it is not eluted by 1 Molar glycine. In this respect the product is superior to corresponding adsorbents based on iminodiacetate as a metal fixing ligand group. Thus, by using an adsorption substance according to the invention heavy metals could be extracted from solutions having a high concentration of light metal salts. An area of use is thus concentration of heavy metals from sea water.In suitable varieties with respect to the choice of matrix see below it should be possible to use the product for purification of industry or mining water and for preparation of ultrapure drinking water.The product could also be used for separating heavy metals from each other.As indicated above the product according to the invention in a metal charged state is an adsorbent for substances having metal affinity. By choosing a high permeable hydrophil matrix the product, especially in a metal charged state, is an adsorption means for biopolymers such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids etc. Also other substances having a metal affinity, such as amino acids, amines, phenols, mercapto compounds etc. are adsorbed and could be desorbed from a metal chelate gel. By charging a layer of particular gel according to the invention with cadmium ions one could specifically catch proteins from serum which has an affinity of cadmium. On a zinc gel proteins binding zinc could be caught.On a series of gel layers where the layers contain different fixed metal ions and where the layers are coupled in tandem a mixture of proteins could be separated according to the different affinities of the proteins to the respective metals. The composite column could then be demounted and the adsorbed material could be eluted separately from each layer. The elution could be made in different ways by changing the pH or by introducing into the eluting medium competing substances. What could be very useful and here is another difference as compared to the usual ion exchanger is the possibility to introduce a very strongly chelate forming substance in the eluting material such as ethylene diamine tetra acetix acid EDTA . This technique has been described previously J. Porath et al., Nature 258 1975 598 however not by using a product according to the present invention.By using this product sharper separations are obtained and furthermore, the metal ions are more strongly fixed to the polymer matrix. The improved separations are not predictable in quantitive terms and have shown to be surprisingly good.The matrix of the adsorbent, i.e. the carrier of the metal chelating groups, could be of different nature. It could be unsolvable, e.g. a particle gel forming substance. The matrix could be thread or net shaped. It could also be a water soluble polymer. As an example of suitable gel forming matrix agar and agarose and other polysaccharides from marine algae, dextrane, cellulose and unsoluble starch could be mentioned. These substances could often by preference be existing in a cross linked state. Suitable synthetic matrix material could be polyvinyl alcohol, polyamides of nylon type and polyacrylacids derivatives such as polyacrylate, especially hydroxyalkylpolyacrylate Spheron and polyacrylamides, e.g. hydroxymetylized acrylamides Trisacryl GFO5 . To obtain a gel product each derivative should be cross linked.C ulose and cellulose derivatives could be used as a matrix.and could then possibly be designed as paper sheets.The adsorbent according to the invention could also be used as a water soluble adsorbent for heavy metal ions or in a metal charged state for forming complexes of natural products or synthetic substances having a metal affinity. It is then important to be able to separate the soluble substance after the adsorption by means of precipitation or by dialytic procedures or possibly through ultracentrifugation or molecule filtration. The matrix of the product should thenhave a molecular size which facilitates its separation stages. A sharp limit could not be set up, but the molecular weight of the polymers should exceed 5000 dalton. Suitable solvable matrixes could be soluble starch, dextrane, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols or simple derivatives from these e.g. monoeters or esters of polyethylene glycol etc. .Also other soluble polymers are possible, they should however have such a chemical composition that the specific character of the product is reduced High concentrations of other strong ligand groups in addition to the characteristic metal chelating groups should not be present. Thus, matrixes having high concentrations of carboxyle, free amino groups not amides , thiol groups could thus not be used. One is here dealing with relative concentrations and in order to avoid strong disturbances the ratio between charactristic metal chelating groups to other metal binding groups should exceed 10. This eliminates most pure proteins as matrix material, but compound polymers of e.g. proteins and low molecular substances such as oligoglucanes could be used for matrixes in the product according to the invention.A cross linked copolyderivate of dextrane or starch and gelatine could be mentioned as an example.Characterizing for the above mentioned matrixes is their hydrophil features. According to the invention these features could be defined in chemical terms. Thus, all these matrixes have ahigh molecular weight 5000 dalton which often results in that they are soluble and will swell in water into gels. The water affinity is characteristic and is in all instances dependent on an even distribution of a high number of hydrophil groups in the matrix.These groups are of the following type OH, NH2, NHR,NR2, CONH2, CONR2, O in etherbinding OCH3, CH2 O CH2 CH2 0 , heterocyclic oxygen and nitrogen and CO. They should be present in sufficient amounts to give the matrix the desired hydrophylity.In the above given example the number of hydrophil groups gives the matrix a contents of these groups exceeding 25 of the weight of the dry substance polysaccharides 40 50 , polymetaacrylamide 51,4 polyacrylamide and polyacrylate 252 , polyethylene glycols 36,4 . When introducing the characteristic metal binding groups the elimination of one hydrophil group is replaced by several hydrophil groups N ana COOH , the product according to the invention thus usually being more hydrophil than the unsubstituted matrix. It is also characterizing that the groups are more or less evenly distributed within the complete matrix and that the matrix is formed by a polymer where each monomer unit contains at least one hydrophil group. The product according to the invention will thus contain at least 25 hydrophil groups of the above defined type.It should be noted that the product according to the invention for certain purposes could be mixed with other substances. This means that for such applications for instance purification of industry water the starting material for producing the product could be mechanical paper pulp, saw dust or other waste material containing cellulose or hemicellulose. The adsorbent could also be coated as a layer around the hydrofobe of non waterabsorbing material or be present as a matrix in which such material are embedded.The product according to the invention could be produced in several ways. Usually reactive groups have to be introduced into the carrier material. However, such groups might already be present in the matrix, e.g. ketogroups which could be condensed with amino groups and thereupon reduced . As suitable reactive groups could be mentionedEMI10.1 and active halogen. The metal binding groups could thereupon be introduced in one or two steps which can be described for variety I withR H as follows Method 1EMI10.2 Method 2EMI10.3 where P is the polymer matrix substituted with X which is the reactive group and where Y is an halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine. The reaction is suitably carried out in alcalic water environment or in an organic solvent in the presence of a catalyst.It should however be noted that the product can be produced by other means, e.g.EMI10.4 tb Method SEP 3 SEP ,CN SEP CN tb CHO SEP CHO SEP SEP HZN CH CH, N,CN SEP CH N CH2 CH2 NvCN tb NaBH SEP or SEP LiAlH SEP CN tb SEP 4 SEP 4 SEP commat SEP CH2 NH CH2 CH2 SEP NvCN tb YCH SEP COOH SEP ,CN SEP OH tb SEP 2 SEP 3 SEP CH2 SEP SEP N SEP SEP CH2CH2N CN SEP heat SEP T SEP I tb SEP 6H2 SEP COOH tb The method 2 is presumably the most simple one considering the starting materials. This method is also suitable for analogue derivatives, e.g. where the ethylene diamine is exchanged for 1 2 diaminopropyle or 1 2 diaminobutane or 1,2 diaminocyclohexane see example III 6 and 12 for producing a product according to variety II where R H. One could also produce an adsorbent according to the invention starting from an amine containing polymer by treating this polymer with glutaraldehyde and a subsequent reduction and carboxylation.The product according to the invention could also be given varying properties through the structure of the spacer which separates the metal binding group from the gel matrix. This spacer group is often a carrier of the reactive substituent to which the metal binding group is fixed. If, for instance, epichlorhydrine is used for activating the matrix O CH2 CHOH CH 2 is obtained as a spacer group where one oxygen from an original OH group in the matrix has been included . With a bisepoxide such as n butanediolbisglycidylether the following spacer is obtained O CH2 CHOH CH2 O CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 O CH2 CHOH CH2. Such a long spacer could be advantageous or necessary in order to make the metal chelate group reach the interior of a protein molecule. Even longer spacer groups could be designed, e.g. with polyethyleneglycol.With a sufficient degree of polymerization a mono or disubstituted polyethyleneglycol is as such a variety of the invention, for example EMI11.1 where n 50 the derivative of the molecular weight exceeding 5000. It has a contents of metal chelate forming groups according to the invention which exceeds 9 . At a unilateral substitution the concentration of metal binding group is more than 4 . As n increases the ability for the product to bind a metal is reduced, calculated on each unit of weight. In order to obtain an efficient metal chelating effect the product should contain at least 0.5 of weight metal binding groups. This is true for the product in all its varieties, i.e. also when it exists at gel particles.The use of the product according to the invention will now be illustrated by means of a number of examples which also illustrate varieties and some different forms of the products according to the invention. Production of a product according to the variety I Example 1. 0.5 kg Sephadex G 25 crosslinked dextrane absorbing approximately 2.5 g water per gram is treated with 2.5 1 0.8 M NaOH and 120 ml epichlorhydrine. After one hour further 500 ml 4 M NaOH and 240 ml epichlorhydrin is added. The suspension is left over night while agitated. The gel is washed in water, 10 acetic acid, water and 0.2 M NaHCO3.To the gel 300 ml ethylenediamine and 600oml 0.2 M NaHCO3 is added and the suspension is stirred in a reaction flask, 0 is heated to 50 C and is left at this temperature for 8 hours. The gel is then again washed with water, 10 acetic acid, water and 0.2 M NaHCO3.In a five litre round flask 375 g bromine acetic acid, 120 gNaOH and 800 g water is introduced, whereafter pH is adjusted to 9 with solid NaOH. The gel is added and the suspension is stirred over night at room temperature. The gel is washed with water, 10 acetic acid and water. From 0.5 kg crosslinked dextrane 2.2 kg readymade swelled gel absorbing 38 jimol Cu2 per ml gel is obtained. The major of the copper ions were not eluted with 1 M glycine but with 0.1 M sodium salt of ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid pH 7. xampIe 2Example 2 700 g 4 swelled bead agarose is mixed in a 5 litre reaction flask with 460 ml 2 M NaOH and 50 ml 1.4 butanedioldiglycidyl ether. 460 ml 2 M NaOH and 230 ml bisepichlbrhydrine is added batchwise during about 1 1 2 hour during stirring.The reaction is allowed to continue over night. The gel is washed with water, diluted acetic acid, water and 0.2M NaHCO3.The gel is transferred into a reaction flask and 300 ml 0.2 M NaHCO3 and 200 ml ethylene diamine is added. The gel is heated in a water bath to 50 0C and is stirred during 20 hours.The gel is washed with water, diluted acetic acid, water and finally with 1 M Na2CO3. The gel is transferred into a reaction vessel. l25gbromineacetic acid dissolved in 400 ml 2 M NaOH and 400 ml 1 M NaHCO3 is added and pH is adjusted to 11.3 with solid state NaOH. After 16 hours of stirring the reaction is interrupted. The gel is washed with distilled water, diluted acetic acid and distilled water. From the product a sample is taken and is tested with respect to its ability to adsorb copper ions. 27 lmol Cu2 was adsorbed per ml.gel. Example 3 5 g partially hydrolyzed starch was dissolved in 50 ml 0.6 M NaOH in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. 10 ml epichlorhydrin is added and the contents was being shaken over night. The starch was through this treatment transformed into a gel. The gel was washed with water , 0.1 M Na2CO3 and mixed with 2 ml 1.2 diaminocyclohexane 9 20 ml 0.1 MNa2CO3. After shaking in 4 hours the gel was washed with water and with 1 M NaHCO3. The gel was transferred into a flask curtaining 6 g chlorine acetic acid dissolved In 20 ml 1 M NaHCO3 through which solid state NaOH was added to obtain a pH of 10. The gel suspension was shaken at 50OC over night. The gel was transferred onto a filter and was washed with water and with diluted copper nitrate solution to saturation.The adsorbed copper was not removed by acetate or trisbuffer in the pH range 4 9.Example 4 5 g Biogel 10, a crosslinked polyacrylamide, was treated according to Example 3 with the difference that 1.2 diaminecyclohexane was exchanged for ethylediamine. The gel did adsorb great amount of copper ions and was given a deep dark blue colour.Example 5 5 g cotton was treated according to Example 4. The product while maintaining the fibre structure of cotton was coloured intensively blue.Example 6 5 g cotton was treated according to Example 5 with the difference that the ethylendiamine was exchanged for 1.2 diamino n butane. The product adsorbed copper and could not visually be separated from the product according to Example 5.Example 7 SponGe 5g was treated in accordance with Example 5.The product obtained a green colour in contact with copper ions. The green colour could not be removed with a strong complex former e.g. EDTA.Example 8 5 g cellulose powder was treated with 2g cyanurchloride in 25 ml 0.2 M Na2CO3 for 30 minutes. The powder was washed with water and thereafter with 0.2 M Na2CO The powder was transferred into a reaction flask and 2 ml ethylene diamine and 25 ml 0.2 M Na2CO3 was added. After 3 hours the sample was taken out and was tested with copper nitrate solution. Copper was adsorbed thus, ethylene diamine had been coupled with cellulose. Thereafter a bromine acetate treatment according to Example 3 was carried out. The end product adsorbed copper ions stronger than the intermediate product, which could also be proved with an elution experiment with glucine andEDTA, thus th e ethylene diamine substituent had been carboxylemethylated.Example 9 was carried out as Example 8 with the exchange of 3g 3.6 dichlorpyridazine for 2 g cyanurchloride. The end product did adsorb copper.Example 10 50 ml 0.2 M Na2CO3 was poured over 5 g dyalisis tubing cellulose acetate in a 250 ml flask and 0.5 ml divinylsulfon was added. After 20 minutes the solvent was removed.The tubing was washed with distilled water and with 0.2 MNa2CO3. The tubing was then transferred into a flask with 1.2 M Na2CO3 and 2 ml ethylene diamine and was left for 24 hours. The tubing was washed with water and 0.2 MNa2CO3 and was transferred into a flask. To the flask 50 ml 0.2 M Na2CO3 and 2 g ClCH2COONa was added. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 4 hours whereafter the temperature was increased to 600C and the reaction was allowed to continue for one hour. The tubing was washed with distilled water and was tested with respect to its copper ion binding properties. A similar copper ion adsorption test was made with a blind sample consisting of a tubing treated in the same way as the real sample with the exception that divinylsulfon had been eliminated.The sample did adsorb copper ions considerably more than the blind sample which was only insignificantly coloured blue. The copper adsorbed in the blind sample could also be easier desorbed with glycine solution than the sample tubing. The following examples illustrate how a water soluble metal binding polymer according to the invention could be produced.Example 11 5 g hydrolysed dextrane having a molecular weight of around 10000 dalton was treated with 2 ml ëpichlorhydrine in 20 ml 0.5 M NaOH. No gel was obtained. The solution was transferred into a dialysis tubing and was dialyzed 14 hours to water and thereafter during the same time to 0.1 M Na2CO3. 10 ml ethylene diamine was added and the solution was left for two days and was then dialyzed to water. The solution was then dialyzed to 1 M Na2CO3 where after 2 g solid state NaOH and 3 g bromine acetic acid was added. After 24 hours the solution was dialyzed to water until the dialyzed product had become neutral.1 ml 0.1 M copper nitrate was added and the solution was dialyzed to water. Part of the copper ions could not be dialyzed and were thus bound to the polymer.Example 12Polyvinylalcohol was treated as dextrane in Example 11 above with the difference that ethylene diamine was changed for 1.2 diamine propane. A strongly copper ion adsorbing polymer was obtained. Example13 1 M sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, pH 8.5, containing a mixture of soluble starch and hemoglobin was brought in contact with a copper containing sponge produced according to Example 7. The sponge did adsorb the hemoglobine but left the starch in the solution. The hemoglobine sponge was squeezed, washed with the ammonium carbonate solution, was squeezed again and was allowed to swell in 0.1 M imidazol solution, pH 6.5. The hemoglobine was transferred into the solution. Carbonhydrate and protein could thus fast and efficiently be separated from one another by means of this method.Example 14Two layers of 10 ml volume, one of which was filled with cellulose to which iminodiacetic acid was substituted layer I and the other layer II was made up by a cellulose derivative according to the invention as defined in Example 8. The two layers were connected in series.The layers were saturated with nickel ions by means of making a nickel chloride solution in distilled water pass the layer. The excess nickel solution was washed out with water and 1 M glycine. Almost all nickel lefter the iminoacetic gel while the nickel contents of the tricarboxymethylethylene diamine gel was reduced insignificantly.The layers were washed with 0.1 M trishydrochloride, pH 8.10 ml of an extract from cow liver, adjusted to pH 8 and released of unsolved material was introduced in the coupled layers. The major part of protein adsorbed was found in layer II and could be diluted by means of washing with 0.1 M sodium acetate. The experiment showed that the chelating iminoacetic acid could not keep the nickel ion whereas the gel according to the invention is a good protein adsorbent. Electrophoretic analysis of non adsorbed protein and protein removed from the gel according to the invention showed that a sharp separation of the protein cDmpc nnnt of the liver extract had been obtained. Example 15 A 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 9.0 solution of cytochrome c, 0.1 , was brought in contact with a dialysis tubing according toExample 10 which was saturated with tallium III chloride.The tubing adsorbed all colour from the solution, i.e. cytocho was .adsorbed to the dialysis membranes. The cytochrome could be eluted from the membranes with 0.1 M imidazol.Two 10 ml layers of Fe III gels were connected in series. layer I consisting of an agar gel according to Example 2, layer II of an analogue agar gel with iminodiacetate as a metal chelator substituent. The gel was washed with 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH adjusted to 5.5. 5 ml human blood serum dialyzed to the acetate buffer, was introduced into the column which was then washed with acetate buffer. Three fractions were obtained a non adsorbed material, b adsorbed material in layer I and c material adsorbed in layer II. The major part of the material in layer I and layer II was desorbed from the layers with 0.1 M tris HC1, pH 8.0. Electrophoretic analysis showed that the proteins in the three fractions were of different natures. Serum albumin was lacking in the fraction of the gel according to the invention which is important from a preparative point of view. It should also be noted that Fe III is strongly adsorbed to iminodiacetic acid gel contrary to nickel but the gel according to the invention also in this case proves its big value as an adsorbent with a high selectivity.
