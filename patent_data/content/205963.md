## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXIAL GROWTH This invention relates to a method and an apparatus for molecular beam epitaxial growth capable of making a high intensity molecular beam compatible with a uniform film thickness, even when the film is grown over a wide area, by adjusting the relation between the positions of a molecular beam source cell and a substrate holder. Fig. 1 is a side view showing the relative positions of a conventional molecular beam source cell and a conventional substrate holder. A manipulator 8 is attached to a substrate holder 2 inside a vacuum chamber not shown . The substrate holder 2 is turned by the manipulator 8, for instance, in the direction of arrow C in Fig. 1. The substrate holder 2 holds a substrate 4. A molecular beam source cell 6 radiates a molecular beam 10 and is so arranged that its opening 61, which defines a molecular beam 10, faces the surface of the substrate 4.Furthermore, it aims the beam 10 at a location close to the center of the substrate 4. The growth epitaxial growth of a film on the substrate 4 is such that, while the substrate holder 2 is being turned by the manipulator 8 to turn the substrate 4, the substrate 4 is heated by a heater not shown installed in the manipulator 8. The molecular beam source cell 6 is also heated by a heater not shown provided in the molecular beam source cell 6 to make the cell generate the molecular beam 10. The molecular beam 10 is made incident on the substrate 4 and the molecules in the beam 10 accumulate on the substrate 4. In that case, if the distance between the molecular beam source cell 6 and substrate 4 is set relatively short, the intensity of the molecular beam incident on the substrate 4 will be increased. However, the uniformity of the thickness of the film in growth will be degraded. If the distance between the molecular beam source cell 6 and the substrate is set relatively longer, the uniformity of the film thickness will be improved.However, the intensity of the molecular beam will be decreased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance, thus producing a lower growth rate. Fig. 2 shows an example of film distribution in the direction along the diameter of the substrate 4 when one substrate is attached to the substrate holder 2 for film growth. As the density distribution of the molecular beam 10 radiated from the molecular beam source cell 6 normally conforms to the cosine law 0or e law , the distribution 7 of film thickness is also mountain shaped.It is, however, possible to obtain a relatively good uniformity of film thickness in a relatively narrow area, e.g., an area equivalent to a 1 or 2 inch substrate. If only one piece of substrate 4 is attached to the substrate holder 2 for film growth, productivity is low because only one piece is grown for each growth cycle.On the other hand, there has been proposed a method for simultaneously growing films on a plurality of substrates by enlarging the substrate holder 2 and attaching a plurality of, e.g., four, pieces of substrate 4 to the substrate holder 2 shown in Fig. 3. However, the distribution 7 of film thickness over such a wide area will assume the form shown in Fig. 4 and the uniformity of film thickness is thus degraded. In this case also, the longer the distance is between the molecular beam source cell 6 and the substrate 4, the greater the uniformity of film thickness becomes. If the distance therebetween is so increased, the intensity of the molecular beam will be greatly decreased and, as described above, the growth rate will, as a result, also be reduced. The problem is that the intensity of a molecular beam and the uniformity of film thickness are incompatible in the conventional method, such as, where growth is attempted over a large area for the growth of a plurality of substrates. On the other hand, another proposed idea is such that each of a plurality of substrates 4 be rotated on its own axis and all of them are also revolved in common about a common axis in order to improve the uniformity of film thickness. In that case, however, another problem arises that the mechanism of the manipulator become extremely complicated. An object of the present invention is to make the high intensity of a molecular beam and the uniformity of film thickness compatible when films are grown in a large area without using a special manipulator. A method for growth of epitaxy by means of a molecular beam in accordance with the present invention includes the step of attaching more than one substrate to a substrate holder installed in an evacuated chamber. The opening of a molecular beam source cell for irradiating a molecular beam is positioned opposite to the plane of the substrate attached to the substrate holder. The substrate holder is then turned while a film is grown on the substrate by making the molecular beam from the molecular beam source cell incident on the substrate so that the molecules of the beam accumulate on the substrate.The following parameters are defined a diameter D of the substrate holder, a distance x between a point where the centerline of the molecular beam source cell intersects the plane of the substrate surface and the center of rotation of the substrate holder, and a distance y between the opening of the molecular beam source cell and the plane of the substrate surface on the centerline of the molecular beam source cell. According to the invention, the film is grown under the conditions of 0.4D x e 0.7D that is, near or slightly outside the radius and 0.7D y E 1.6D. An apparatus for growth of epitaxy by means of a molecular beam in accordance with the present invention comprises a substrate holder installed in a vacuum chamber, the substrate holder being capable of holding more than one substrate. A manipulator turns the substrate holder. A molecular beam source cell irradiates the molecular beam. An opening of the molecular beam source cell is positioned opposite to a plane of the substrate surface attached to the substrate holder.The following parameters are defined a diameter D of the substrate holder, a distance x between a point where the centerline of the molecular beam source cell intersects the plane of the substrate surface and the center of rotation of the substrate holder, and a distance y between the opening of the molecular beam source cell and the plane of the substrate surface on the cPnterline of the molecular beam source cell. According to the invention, the distance x is set within a range of 0.4D 6 x 0.7D and the distance y is set within a range of 0.7D y 1.6D. Fig. 1 is a side view showing the positional relation between a conventional molecular beam source cell and a substrate holder. Figs. 2 and 4 are schematic diagrams showing examples of the distribution of film thickness in the diametric direction of a substrate holder obtained through a conventional method. Fig. 3 is a plan view showing an example of four substrates attached to the substrate holder. Figs. 5 and 6 are side views illustrating the positional relation between a molecular beam source cell and a substrate holder according to the present invention. Fig. 7 shows an example wherein the uniformity of film thickness changes when a distance y is changed with a distance x as a parameter. Fig. 8 shows an example wherein the intensity of a molecular beam changes when the distance y is changed with the distance x as a parameter. Fig. 9 is a schematic diagram showing an example of the distribution of film thickness in the diametric direction of the substrate holder obtained according to the present invention. Figs. 5 and 6 are side views illustrating the relation between the positions of the molecular beam source cell and the substrate holder according to the present invention. A substrate holder 2 is attached to a manipulator 8 in a vacuum chamber not shown . The substrate holder 2 is turned by the manipulator 8 in the direction of arrow C, for instance. A plurality of substrates 4, according to this example, are attached to the periphery of the substrate holder 2 at locations an equal distance apart from its center see Fig. 6 . A molecular beam source cell 6 radiates a molecular beam not shown and is so arranged relative to the manipulator that its opening 61 is placed opposite to a plane to which the surface of the above substrate belong. A centerline A of the beam is approximately perpendicular to the center of a surface defined by the opening 61. In that case, the surface of the substrate holder 2, and therefore the substrates also, may be variously oriented, e.g., downwardly as shown in Fig. 5, diagonally as shown in Fig. 6, laterally illustration omitted or any other direction as long as they can satisfy the specified positional relation with the opening 61 of the molecular beam source cell 6. The molecular beam source cell 6 is so arranged as to aim at a location substantially offset from the center of the substrate holder 2 and near its circumference. First the following parameters are defined. In other words, the diameter D of the substrate holder 2 a distance x between a point P where the centerline A of the molecular beam source cell 6 crosses the plane to which the surfaces of the substrates belong and the rotational center B of the substrate holder 2, and a distance y from the opening 61 of the molecular beam source cell 6 to intersection of the centerline A of the molecular beam source cell 6 with the plane to which the surface of the substrates belong.The distance x is set within a range of 0.4D x I 0.7D, whereas the distance y is set within a range of 0.7D i y 1.6D. Note that, as illustrated in Fig. 5, the point P may lie outside the radius of the substrate holder 2 and the substrates.Films are grown under these conditions and the reason for this will be described later. Because the thickness of the substrate 4 on the substrate holder 2 is so small as to be ignorable in comparison with the distance y e.g., normally on the order of 0.1 mm , it practically makes no difference to regard the distance y as equivalent to the distance between the opening 61 of the molecular beam source cell 6 and the plane of the surface of the substrate holder 2. The epitaxial growth of the film relative to each substrate 4, in specific terms, comprises the steps of turning the substrate as a whole by turning the substrate holder 2 using the manipulator 8, heating each substrate 4 by means of the same heating means not shown as a conventional one, simultaneously heating the molecular beam source cell 6 to make a molecular beam radiate so that its molecular particles are incident on each substrate and accumulated there. The reasons for setting the distances x and y within the above ranges will be now described. Fig. 7 shows examples in which the uniformity of film thickness changes as the distance y is changed with the distance x as a parameter. The film thickness uniformity has been calculated by obtaining the distribution of film thicknesses by integrating the intensity of a molecular beam at each point along the direction of the diameter of the substrate holder 2 when it is turned. The uniformity would be variations from the normalized integral. InFig. 7, the uniformity of film thickness is improved as it is located close to the horizontal axis. The value U1 shows an upper limit of the film thickness uniformity practically allowable for an apparatus of this type and, for instance, a variation of several percentage points is generally selected.Obviously, there is an area where the preferred uniformity of film thickness is obtained within the range of x 0.4D and y 0.7D. More specifically, the uniformity of film thickness better than that of the value Ul can be obtained in the following cases. When x 0.4D, the distance y is a value corresponding to a location close to the point a in Fig. 7. When x 0.5D, it is within a range of values of y corresponding to the points b to e. When x 0.6D, it is above a value corresponding to the point c. And, when x 0.7D, it is above a value corresponding to the point d. Fig. 8 shows examples in which the intensity of the molecular beam tends to change when the distance y is changed with the distance x as a parameter associated with the solid lines. The intensity of the molecular beam in this case has been calculated as the mean value of the intensities of the molecular beam at each point on the substrate holder 2 obtained through the above calculation.In Fig. 8, obviously the intensity of the molecular beam becomes greater as the plotted point departs from the horizontal axis. An area enclosed by two broken lines L1 and L2 in Fig 8 shows a range of distances x and y allowable in view of the uniformity of film thickness.These curves L1 and L2 correspond to a continuous plot of points a e Which corresponds to the points a e in Fig. 3.Consequently, a value M1 corresponding to the point a is an upper limit for the intensity of the molecular beam to assume in consideration of the allowable uniformity of film thickness. On the other hand, if other conditions which reduce the intensity of the molecular beam are selected, the molecular beam radiated from the molecular beam source cell 6 will not be fully utilized and these conditions are thus detrimental to economical operation.Accordingly, the lower limit value M2 of the allowable intensity of the molecular beam is normally selected as about M2 M1 3 in this kind of apparatus. The area satisfying the standard of good uniformity of film thickness and the relatively strong intensity of molecular beam is located in an area which is enclosed by the broken lines L1 and L2 and above the lower limit value M2. The lower limit value M2 introduces the conditions x 5 0.7D and y 1.6D. The collective conditions associated with Figs. 7 and 8 are 0.4D b x 0.7D and 0.7D t y S 1.6D. These conditions are easily quantifiable but not as precise as the requirement that x and y fall within the area enclosed by lines Llr L2 and M2 in Fig. 8. Fig. 9 shows an example of the distribution of film thickness in the diametric direction of the substrate holder 2 obtained under the above conditions of 0.4D x 0.7D and 0.7D y 1.6D. Under the above conditions, the crest of a peak is located in the neighborhood of the center of each substrate 4 although uneveness in thickness is still slightly observable. The improved uniformity of film thickness is obtained in an area wider than what is available through the conventional method see Fig. 4 for comparison . Moreover, the intensity of the molecular beam obtainable is relatively greater because it is unnecessary to increase the distance between the molecular beam source cell 6 and the substrate 4.It is noted that the irradiation of multiple substrates 4 is particularly advantageous since the central minimum of the film thickness curve occurs where there is no substrate. It has thus been confirmed by calculations that the intensity of molecular beam and the uniformity of film thickness are compatible even when films are grown in a wide area, provided that the distances x and y are limited to the above described ranges. According to the above described apparatus, a plurality of substrates 4 can be attached to the substrate holder 2 and simultaneously grown, whereby productivity can also be increased. Needless to say, the improved uniformity of film thickness is available without turning each substrate on its axis but only commonly rotating it around with the other substrates, i.e., only turning the substrate holder 2 as shown in Fig. 5 or 6, so that the construction of the manipulator is not very complicated.Moreover, the distance between the molecular beam source cell 6 and the substrate 4 is reduced and yet the improved uniformity of film thickness is still obtainable.Consequently, a large size vacuum chamber growth chamber is unnecessary. Instead of simultaneous growth of films on a plurality of substrates, a large diameter e.g., 6 inches substrate may be attached to the substrate holder 2 for the growth of a film and the relatively strong intensity of the molecular beam and the better uniformity of film thickness are, needless to say, available in the same way. According to the present invention, the intensity of a molecular beam and the uniformity of film thickness are made compatible even when films are grown in a wide area and the relatively greater intensity of the molecular beam and the better uniformity of film thickness can be obtained. Accordingly, it becomes possible to grow films on a plurality of substrates or to grow a film on a large diameter substrate. According to the present invention, moreover, the use of the special manipulator is unnecessary and a vacuum container for the growth of films remains compact.
