# Gene coding for signal peptides and utilization thereof.

## Abstract
A DNA strand of a gene coding for a signal peptide to be used in the host vector system employing a bacterium belonging to the genus Streptomyces as a host by incorpora tion in the vector DNA, which comprises a DNA having a base sequence coding for the peptide having the amino acid sequence from X to Y in the annexed Fig. 1, is disclosed. A vector plasmid to be used for transformation of bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces, comprising a DNA strand with a base sequence coding for an extra cellular Î± amylase derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus SF 1084 strain or a mutant thereof, the DNA strand being incorporated in a vector plasmid to be used in the host vector system employing a bacterium belonging to the genus Streptomyces as a host and also having a DNA necessary for expression of the gene information of the DNA strand, the DNA being introduced in the vector plasmid is also disclosed. The present invention may be applied to the production of a desired protein which will be secreted outside the host microorganism.
