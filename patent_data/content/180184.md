# Acceleration control system for automobiles.

## Abstract
In an automobile which employs an engine 1 the output of which varies with the amount of operation applied to the op erating terminal 1a of the engine 1 and a continuously vari able transmission 6 having a reduction ratio which can be rendered infinite or close to infinity when the automobile is started, an acceleration control system comprising means 21 for detecting the output torque of the transmission 6 , and means 22 for correcting the amount of operation to be ap plied to the operating terminal in such a manner that when the torque detecting means detects the output torque of the en gine having exceeded a predetermined allowable maximum lev el, the engine output is reduced so as to offset the excessive amount of torque.
