## Description
This invention relates to a video image creation system. Video image creation systems are known. For example, the system described in G B A 2165728 and shown in Figure 1 is capable of producing a high resolution image whilst simultaneously allowing the operator to view a low resolution version of the image on a colour television monitor. The operator creates the image by drawing on touch tablet 2 with a stylus and choosing a colour and notional implement using keyboard 1. The touch tablet produces signals representing the co ordinates of the point of contact between the touch tablet and the stylus and these signals are translated to frame store addresses by computer 3. For each picture point designated luminance and chrominance video signals for that and several neighbouring picture points called a patch are processed. The number of picture points in each patch and the distribution of chrominance or luminance signals for these points is pre determined for each type of notional implement which may be chosen. On chosing an implement using the key board signals representing the distribution are stored on the shape RAM 4. Video signals representing the chosen colour are stored at corresponding picture points in the patch RAM 5. To obtain the image, each picture point video signal in a patch from 5 is processed in the processor 6 with the signal from that address in the frame store 7, the distribution signal from RAM 4 being used to determine the proportions of new and stored information which will make up the processed signal. The contents of the frame store 7 are read periodically to a television display system 8, to produce a picture of the image. The frame store has sufficient storage locations to store signals for each image point in a picture conforming to TV standards in resolution. The distribution is provided to simulate the effect of the implement on paper. This type of processing is described in GB A 2089625. The system for producing high resolution images shown in Figure 1 is divided into two parts, one working at high resolution and one at lower resolution. The processors 6 and 18 in both parts are the same and operate at a rate of 700,000 pixels per second and this enables the low resolution part to operate so that the image appears on the screen of display 8 as the operator draws it which is usually a conventional colour T.V. monitor. The frame store 19 in the high resolution part is typically capable of storing 2560 by 2048 picture points which is approximately thirteen times that of the frame store in the low resolution part. The number of picture points in the frame store 19 is much larger than in frame store 6 and each patch associated with a designated picture point will include many more picture points and so there will be more picture points to be processed for each designated address and the processing tends to lag behind that in the low resolution part. The processor is unable to process the signals at the rate required to keep up with the command signals from computer 3 for all rates of drawing by the artist and so a buffer store 15 is provided to store these signals. The signals from keyboard 1 and touch tablet 2 are received by the computer 3 where they are translated to give addresses, patch size and distribution signals to be used in the processing. In the high resolution part of the system the number of picture points in a patch will be greater than in the low resolution part but the shape of the distribution will be the same. The signals from the computer are output to address generator 9, which generates the patch of addresses as required by frame store 7, patch RAM 5, shape RAM 4 and buffer store 15. The patch RAM 5 produces the picture point video signals for the addresses generated by address generator 9. The picture point video signals from patch RAM 5 are processed with corresponding picture point signals from frame store 7 to give a picture on display 8 in approximately real time, i.e. as the operator draws a line it will appear on the screen blending with any picture information previously in the store 7 for the same addresses. The image produced on the screens will closely simulate the effects expected if the operator were using real painting equipment such as paper and pens. Unless the processing in the high resolution part of the system is keeping up with the input commands these will be held in the buffer store until the processor is able to process the patch of picture point signals surrounding the designated signal. However, the operator is able to continue creating the image in his own time, since he is able to observe the effect he is creating by observing the low resolution display at 8, although he can not observe the high definition picture whilst it is in the course of processing. The generation of the high resolution video signals is effected by means of address generator 20, shape RAM 16 and patch RAM 17 shown as components Y, I, Q sections 17A, 17B, 17C. The picture point signals are applied to processor 18 comprising section A, B and C the results are applied to store sections 19A, 19B and 19C, the final picture is applied from 19 for reproduction in a printing scanner 21 or by other graphic process. As the production of the image in real time progresses the generation of the high resolution video image may lag behind although if the operator is working at a slow rate the processing may catch up. The speed of processing required to keep up with the operator depends on the implement chosen, therefore patch size, and how quickly the operator is moving the stylus across the touch tablet. The final image from scanner 21 consists of an 8 bit colour video image with a resolution of 2560 picture points by 2048 lines. The aforementioned system depends for its operation on the fact that the operator normally operates intermittently and may pause between strokes to examine the effect on the picture being created. Such pauses allow the high resolution processor to catch up on the operator, so that the amount of buffer storage required may be held to reasonable limits. However, if the high resolution image processing lags a long way behind the real time processing then the buffer store may become full and the system will no longer accept information from the touch tablet or computer. This situation may occur for example if the operator selects a mode of operation in which painting with an air brush is simulated, which may result in large areas of the picture being painted rapidly. If the buffer becomes full the operator has to cease painting until the high resolution part of the system has processed enough information for the buffer store to be able to accept more. US A 4,197,590 and US 1 4,121,283 respectively disclose a computer graphics display system and an interface device for encoding a digital image for a CRT display. The invention aims to provide a high resolution video image creation system which is capable of processing incoming information at the rate at which it is received. The invention also aims to provide a video image creation system in which the image can be monitored as it is created even although the monitor cannot provide the full resolution of the image. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a video image creation system comprising data storage means for storing data defining a plurality of picture points which together provide a high resolution representation of an image user operable input means for inputting signals which designate picture points in said high resolution image processing means responsive to the signals from the user operable input means for processing designated picture point data and for writing the processed data to the data storage means characterised by viewing storage means for storing data defining a lesser plurality of picture points, as compared to the plurality of picture points representing the high resolution image, which lesser plurality of picture points together represent an image to be output for display and deriving means for deriving from said high resolution picture point data, picture point data to be stored in the viewing storage means, the deriving means being arranged to derive data for the viewing storage means in response to the processed data being written to the data storage means. Preferably, means are provided whereby the signals derived from the storage means may be reduced by filtering to reduce the definition compared with said high definition signals. Alternatively, the derived signals may be reduced by deriving them from a selected area of the storage means so that only part of the image being created is displayed on the monitor. Desirably the operator can select one or the other mode of operation, depending on his mode of working at a particular time. For example, if larger areas of the picture are being worked over at one time, for example to apply a wash or spray it would be desirable for the operator to be able to observe the full image on the monitor, though it be at a lower definition than the final image would be. If on the other hand, the operator is applying detail to only a small part of the image, it would be preferable for the operator to be able to observe only the respective part of the image, but at full definition. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of video image creation, the method comprising designating picture points in a high resolution image processing data corresponding to designated picture points writing the processed data to a data storage means which contains data defining a plurality of picture points which together represent the high resolution image characterised by deriving from said high resolution picture point data picture point data to be stored in a viewing storage means, the data in the viewing storage means defining a lesser plurality of picture points, as compared to the plurality of picture points representing the high resolution image, which lesser plurality of picture points together represent an image to be output for display, the data for the viewing storage means being derived in response to the processed data being written to the data storage means. The above and further features of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims and together with advantages thereof will become clearer from consideration of the following detailed description of an exemplary embodiment of the invention given with reference to the accompanying drawings. Figure 1 shows the prior art system discussed hereinabove and Figure 2 shows a system embodying the invention. The apparatus in Figure 2 is one example of the invention and shares some common features with the high resolution part of the prior image creation system namely touch tablet 28, computer 29, keyboard 30, address generator 31, patch RAM 32, shape RAM 33, and processor 34. The high resolution image in frame store 25 is produced in essentially the same manner as in the prior art but the circuits are designed so that the processing can be done at a much higher rate. Each picture point signal is still processed individually with the signal stored at that address in the frame store 25 but the processing can now be carried out at speeds of up to 9 million picture points per second and so the incoming information may be processed even at the fastest rate at which it is likely to be received. The lower resolution image that appears on display 27 is built up of picture point signals from frame store 25. The image that will be viewed on the display is produced in approximately real time and may consist of a low resolution version of the whole image or of parts of that image at differing resolution dependent on the size of that part. The system operates with 8 bit digital video signals and may use RGB or YUV components. In Figure 2 only the luminance path for a YUV system is shown. The touch tablet stylus combination 28 is capable of generating position signals with an accuracy adequate for the high resolution system and if necessary the computer 29 may interpolate between such position signals to produce the required number of patches per line for the high definition picture. As in the previous systems of UK Patent Applications 2165728 and UK Patent No. 2089625 the operator inputs signals using touch tablet 28 and keyboard 30 via computer 29. The computer accesses the patch of picture point signals to be processed, from patch RAM 32 and the required distribution from shape RAM 33. The distribution is a set of signals representing a value K which determines the proportions of the new and stored signals which are to make up the processed picture point signal. Each picture point signal in patch RAM 32 is processed with the signal from that address in frame store 25. Frame store 25 is typically of dimensions 2560 and 2048 picture points and each patch say of size 30 x 30 picture points for a notional brush. To give an order of magnitude example of the speed at which the processor needs to operate in order to keep up with the operator, consider the case where the operator does a stroke across the touch tablet. If the stroke takes half a second then the line crosses addresses at a rate of 5000 picture points per second. Assume each patch is 1000 pixels then the processing rate required is, very approximately 5000 x 1000 picture points per second, or about five million picture points. It is obvious that this is within the rate of nine million per second of which the processor is capable, and even allowing for greater patch size the processor should be able to keep up. If the patch size, i.e. brush size, is greater, then the operator would expect to go more slowly as this is what happens when using a real large brush. The image to be viewed by the operator on colour display 27 is taken from the viewing store 26 which is of the usual size for television and which receives picture point signals from frame store 25. There are two ways in which the picture point signals may be read from the frame store 25, reduced and written into viewing store 26. One way is to read only from areas of the frame store 25 in which drawing is taking place at the particular time, the reading being alternated with processing of the picture points in the processor 34, affected by the drawing. On this mode of operation the areas in 25 from which reading occurs are controlled by the address generator 36 and area selector 37 in a similar way for example as by address generator 31 and patch RAM 32. The picture point video signals read from 25 the reading being non destructive are read into locations in the viewing store 26 also determined by the address generator 36, so that when this store is read in TV raster sequence, the picture point video signals in question give rise to video effects in the correct positions. The signals in passing from store 25 to store 26 pass through an adjustable filter 35 which is rendered transparent if no reduction in resolution takes place as between store 25 and store 26. If no reduction occurs, the display of the selected areas on the screen of 27 will be enlarged relative to the frame compared with the image stored in store 25. On the other hand, the signals may be reduced by the filter 35 to reduce the resolution and corresponding the area occupied on the display 27 by the part of the image in question. If the resolution is reduced by the filter 35 to correspond to the number of picture points which can be present in the display 27, the whole picture as it is created by the artist will be visible on the display, although updating of video signals in the store 26 will be confined, at any particular time, to those lying in the area in which drawing is occurring. The picture points copied from the store 25 to the viewing store 26 need not, in this mode of operation, be those just processed. Some lag may occur, but in general the transfer will take place soon after drawing occurs. The viewing store 26 is capable of reading out at a rate of 72 million picture point a second and is notionally divided into areas of picture points approximately 1 16 of the frame store size. If the whole of frame store 25 was read at the rate of reading to viewing store 26 the processing would lag behind the reading but during each frame period the operator normally draws a line which will only appear in a maximum of four of these areas. For each area that includes a portion of the stroke drawn by the operator the read modify write processing described above is completed for those picture points making up the stroke and then all the picture points in that patch quarter are written in the viewing store 26 under the control of area selector 37. If the operator is drawing at normal speed a maximum of a quarter of the frame store 25 will have to be copied to the viewing store and this can be achieved in a frame period. In an alternative mode of operation the reading for copying to the viewing store 26 is interleaved in pixel time with the read modify write processing. If the selected addresses to be displayed are such that all picture points from a part area only of the store 25 need be written in the store 26, then the picture in that area can be displayed at full resolution. If, however, the address selection is such as to transfer video signals from the whole area of store 25 to the store 26, data reduction by the filter 35 is necessary to enable the store 26 to accommodate the video signals from the whole area. Thus, when the image is displayed its resolution is reduced. As stated, before being written into the viewing store 26 the picture points pass through filter 35 which has several modes of operations. If the area selected by the selector 37 is such that the number of picture point signals read from frame store 25 is too large for the viewing store or if the whole of the frame store 25 is selected and filter acts to reduce the number by either an averaging over patches of 16 or some other number of picture points or simply by allowing, say, only one in a given number of picture points to pass. Alternatively, the filter may interpolate or replicate picture points if there is enlargement between 25 and 26. The address generator 36 determines the number and location of picture points read from frame store 25 so that whichever part of the image is desired to be viewed can be seen. This may consist of anything from a small patch surrounding the part where the operator is working to a low resolution version of the whole image. As well as providing a low resolution version for display frame store 25 may be read onto a disc store or straight to colour printing scanners so that the high resolution image may be seen. The speed of processing for this type of system has been increased by the use of a type of RAM in the frame store which allows greater speeds of access and the required mode of addressing. The RAMs used are IMS2600 and HM50257 and these allow for four picture points to be stored in consecutive locations of one RAM and accessed quickly. Having thus described the present invention by reference to preferred embodiments it is to be well understood that the embodiments in question are exemplary only and that modifications are variations such as will occur to those possessed of appropriate knowledge and skills may be made without departure from the invention as set forth in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
