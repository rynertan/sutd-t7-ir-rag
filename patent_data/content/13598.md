## Description
COMBINED LINEARITY AND SIDE PINCUSHION CORRECTION ARRANGED4ENT This invention relates to combined side pincushion and linearity correction magnetic structures and circuits. In it typical color television receivers, two separate magnetic components are connected in series with the horizontal deflection winding a linearity coil, and an East West or side pincushion correction coil or transformer. The linearity coil may be wound on a rod or H haped core with one or more bias magnets located adjacent the core. The East West coil may be wound on a separate ferrite rod core or on a closed core like a UU or an EE shape core. The East West E W coil may be part of an ITR Integrated ThyristorRectifier controlled E W modulator circuit such as described in U.S. Patent 4,038,931, by P.E. Haferl, or may be part of a diode modulator circuit such as described in U.S. Patent 3,906,305, by A. H. H. J. Nillesen. East West correction results in a vertical rate modulation of the horizontal deflection or scanning current. The vertical rate modulation of the horizontal scanning current, however, causes an undesirable vertical rate modulation of the magnetic bias of the linearity coil. The effect of the linearity coil is thus different at the top or bottom of the raster than in the center, resulting in uncorrected raster distortion. To correct for this effect, the biasing of the linearity coil is sbmetimes modulated at a vertical rate by couplinc the E W modulator current through an extra winding on the linearity coil, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,024,432, by A. Boekhorst. It would be desirable, however, to combine the functions of both side pincushion correction and linearity correction into one structure which also eliminates the aforementioned raster distortion. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a magnetic structure includes a magnetic core having first and second core portions. A first winding is wound around the first core portion and is suited for coupling to a horizontal deflection winding The second winding is wound around the second core portion and is suited for receiving a correction current including a vertical deflection rated complement. Magnetic biasing means provides a magnetic bias flux to the first core portion for providing linearity correction to horizontal scanning current flowing in the horizontal deflection winding. The first and second core portions are so configured as to establish a high reluctance path for mutual flux linking the first and second windings, for coupling only a portion of the flux generated by the second.winding to the first core portion. The winding polarities of the first and second windings are such as to enable the portion of the flux generated by the second winding to compensate for undesirable changes during vertical scan of the magnetic bias of the first core portion.

A combined linearity and side pincushion correction structure 26 embodying the invention and constructed on a single E shaped magnetic core 21 is illustrated in FIGURE 1. An L shaped portion 21a is magnetically biased by a permanent magnet 22, which has magnetic poles located on opposite ends of the surface that is in contact with the core. A south pole of magnet 22 is, illustratively, located adjacent a center leg 21c of core 21 and a north pole is located adjacent the outer L shaped portion 21a. A winding 23, wound around portion 21a of core 21, is coupled in series with a horizontal deflection winding 50 of a horizontal deflection circuit, as illustrated in the electrical schematic diagram of FIGURE 2. A conductor 12 of winding 23 is coupled to one terminal of horizontal deflection winding 50.Another terminal of horizontal deflection winding 50 is coupled at a terminal 61 to a conventional horizontal deflection generator 52 through a trace capacitor 51, for producing horizontal scanning current in deflection winding 50. A horizontal retrace capacitor 60 is coupled to terminal 61. The magnetic field in the core developed by permanent magnet 22 and by the current flowing in winding 23 is such that at the beginning of horizontal scan the core portion 21a is near saturation. Toward the center of horizontal scan, core portion 21a saturates more and more, until, in the second half of horizontal scan, core portion 21a is substantially in saturation. Center leg 21c because of its larger cross section is not saturated and thus functions as a magnetic shunt for the entire scan. The effect of the inductance variation of portion 21a is that during the first half of horizontal scan, a decreasing linearity inductance is in series with the deflection winding, while during the second half of scan, because of saturation, little inductance is present.This changing inductance during each horizontal scan causes a decreased horizontal deflection current amplitude in the first half of scan which compensates for the nonlinearity of the deflection current in the second half of scan caused by the cumulative losses in the deflection winding and the trace switch, for example. Moving the permanent magnet 22, as indicated in FIGURE 1 along the line 24, slightly changes the saturation point in order to adjust the linearity correction. Winding 23 thereby functions as the required saturable linearity inductance in series with horizontal deflection winding 50. When the linearity inductor is wound around portion 21a of core 21, another outer leg, 21b, is available Magnet 22 is not in close contact with leg 21b.Thus, outer leg 21b, as well as the previously described center leg 21c, is also not in saturation. A winding 25 is then wound around outer leg 21b, as illustrated in FIGURE 1. Loose magnetic coupling exists between core portions 21a and 21b as defined by the geometry of the core. Thus winding 25 may function as the substantially linear or non saturated inductor of an East West modulator circuit. As illustrated in FIGURE 2, a conductor 14 of winding 25 is coupled through a capacitor 53 to a bi directionally conductive ITR switch 54 of an EastWest or side ITR modulator circuit 55. Switch 54 may comprise an SCR 56 and an oppositely poled diode 57 integrated on the same chip. A resistor 58 is coupled across ITR switch 54. A control circuit 59 is coupled to the gate ofSCR 56 and turns on SCR 56 at a vertically varying instant with horizontal retrace. The length of time within horizontal retrace that the inductance of winding 25 is coupled to horizontal deflection winding 50 is thereby varied at a vertical rate, thereby modulating the horizontal scanning current amplitude at a vertical rate for providing side pincushion distortion correction. Control circuit 59 and East West ITR modulator 55 are fully described in the aforementioned United States Patent 4,088,931 of P. E.Haferl. To prevent the vertical modulation component of the horizontal scanning current flowing in linearity inductance winding 23 from undesirably changing the magnetic bias of portion 21a from top to bottom of raster scan, a compensating magnetic flux with a compensating vertical rate flux component is made to flow in portion 21a. This compensating flux is developed by the current flowing in side pincushion correction inductance winding 25, which has flowing in it the horizontal scanning current during each horizontal trace interval. Conductor 14 of side pincushion inductance winding 25 is coupled to a conductor 11 of linearity inductance winding 23, as illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 2.A conductor 13 of winding 25 is coupled to ground.During each horizontal trace interval, horizontal deflection winding 50, linearity inductance winding 23, and side pincushion inductance winding 25 are series connected. The vertically modulated horizontal scanning current flows in all three windings. With the winding polarities of windings 23 and 25 as indicated by the polarity dots in FIGURES 2 and 3, the flux generated by the current flowing in side pincushion inductance winding 25 flows in center leg 21c in the same direction as the flux generated in leg 21a by the current flowing in linearity inductance winding 23. The horizontal deflection current flowing in linearity winding 23, and thus the flux developed by this current flowing in outer leg 21a, is smaller at the top and bottom of the raster than in the center.However, the current flowing in side pincushion correction inductance of the East West ITR modulator circuit 5, and thus the flux flowing in center leg 21c, developed by this current, is larger at the top and bottom of the raster than in the center. The increasing flux in center leg 21c compensates for the decreasing flux produced by linearity winding 23. Thus the flux produced by winding 25 changes.the magnetic bias of portion 21a in a manner which corrects for the undesirable change in magnetic bias caused by the vertical rate component of the current flowing in linearity inductance winding 23. Since the L shaped portion 21a of core 21 and center leg 21c is partly or completely in saturation, no undesirable modulation of the side pincushion correction current flowing in winding 25 occurs.Because of the E shaped geometry of core 21, and because of the placement of windings 23 and 25 around opposite outer legs of core 21, a comparatively high reluctance path exists for the flux mutually linking both windings 23 and 25. Portion 21a is therefore biased near saturation by magnet 22, whereas the bias point of leg 21b is in the relatively linear region of the B H hysteresis curve. Thus, the mutual flux linking windings 23 and 25 has a relatively large compensating effect on the inductance of linearity winding 23 but has a relatively small effect on the inductance of side pincushion correction winding 25. FIGURE 3 illustrates that portion of the electrical schematic circuit of FIGURE 2 associated with another combined linearity and side pincushion structure 126 embodying the invention, similar to the structure 26 of FIGURE 1. FIGURE 4 illustrates the core, winding and magnet arrangement for structure 126.In FIGURES 3 and 4, a transformer, comprising a tapped winding 125, is substituted for the side pincushion correction winding 25 of FIGURES 1 and 2. A tap conductor 14a instead of the lead conductor 14 ofFIGURES 1 and 2, is now coupled to conductor 11 of linearity inductance winding 23. The circuit arrangement of FIGURE 3 has the advantage that the current throughITR 54 is transformed down which results in lower dissipation in the device. Also a smaller valued capacitor 53 is required. Modulator circuits other than East West ITR modulator circuit 55 of FIGURE 2 may be coupled to a combined linearity and side pincushion correction structure embodying the invention. As illustrated inFIGURE 5, a diode modulator circuit 255 may be coupled to a combined linearity and side pincushion correction structure 226. As illustrated in FIGURE 6, structure 226 is generally constructed similar to the construction of structures 26 and 126 of FIGURES 1 and 4. An E shaped core 221 includes a first outer leg or L shaped portion 221a, a enter leg 221c, and a second outer leg 221b. A linearity inductance winding 223 is wound around outer leg 221a. A permanent bias magnet 222, slideable along the line 224, and rotatable abcut an axis 236, is in contact with legs 221a and 221b but is not in close contact with leg 221b. Round around outer leg 221b is a winding 225a for correcting side pincushion distortion with a diode nodulator. Concentrically wound with winding 225a is a transformer coupled secondary winding 225b. As illustrated in FIGURES 5 and 6, a conductor 213 of secondary winding 225b is coupled to ground and a conductor 214 is coupled to a conductor 211 of linearity inductance winding 223.A conductor 212 of winding 223 is coupled to a horizontal deflection winding 250. Horizontai deflection winding 250 is coupled to the collector of a horizontal output transistor 262 of a horizontal deflection generator 252 through a trace capacitor 251. The transistor is switched at a horizontal rate by a conventional horizontal oscillator and driver circuit, not illustrated. The collector of transistor 262 is coupled through a winding of a horizontal output or flyback transformer 263 to a B supply voltage developed at a terminal 264. A damper diode 265 and retrace capacitor 266 are coupled to transistor 262. Diode modulator circuit 255 includes a diode 265 , a capacitor 266 , a capacitor 251 and a modulation voltage source 267 coupled to capacitor 251 through an inductor 270. Modulation voltage source 267 provides a vertical rate parabolic voltage Vm at a terminal 268, with voltage Vm having a minimum at the center of vertical trace. As illustrated in FIGURES 5 and 6, a conductor 215 of side pincushion correction inductance winding 225a is coupled to terminal 268 and a conductor 216 is coupled to the junction of diodes 265 and 265 . Diode 265 , capacitors 266 and 251 of diode modulator circuit 255 function analogously to respective diode 265, and capacitors 266 and 251 associated with horizontal deflection generator 252 for developing a horizontal sawtooth correction current in side pincushion correction inductance winding 225a.The values of capacitors 266 and 266 and the location of the tap on flyback transformer winding 263 are selected such that the currents flowing in deflection winding 250 and in winding 225a have the same horizontal retrace time. The amplitude of the sawtooth current flowing in winding 225a is modulated in a parabolic vertical manner. This modulated sawtooth current is transformed by secondary winding 225b to provide a parabolic vertical rate amplitude modulated sawtooth component to the horizontal scanning current, thereby providing the required side pincushion distortion correction. With the exception of combined linearity and side pincushion correction structure 226, the circuit of FIGURE 5 is similar in operation to arrangements described in the aforementioned U.S. Patent 4,024,432 by A. Boekhorst andU.S. Patent 3,906,305 by A. H. H. J. Nillesen. With the conductors of windings 223, 225a and 225b as described above, the relative winding polarities of the three windings are indicated by the polarity triangles of FIGURES 5 and 6. Accordingly, a compensating flux is developed by the current in winding 225a. This flux is coupled to leg 221a ofFIGURE 6, thereby preventing undesirable changes in the magnetic bias of leg 221a from occurring, as was described similarly for the structure of FIGURE 1 and the circuit of FIGURE 2, for example. With the arrangements embodying the invention, as illustrated in FIGURES 1 6, one magnetic component 26, 126 or 226 replaces two separate components.For example, a conventional linearity coil may use one ferrite rod core and two magnets and a separate E W modulator structure may use a separate UU, EE or rod shaped core. With the inventive embodiments as described, compensatory modulation of the linearity inductance at a vertical frequency rate is obtained by a single structure which also functions to provide, without additional complexity, or separate support housing, a side pincushion correction inductance.
