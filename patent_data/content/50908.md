# INTUMESCENT FLEXIBLE POLYURETHANE FOAM AND PROCESS OF MANUFACTURE THEREOF

## Abstract
Flexible resilient flame retardant and intumescent polyurethane foam is prepared from a reaction mixture comprising a polyester polyol, an organic polyisocyanate, a blowing agent, a surfactant, a catalyst, a melamine derivative and a flame retardant the melamine derivative has one or more hydrogen atoms replaced by a methylol and or lower alkoxymethyl group, the amount of flame retardant is 20 60 parts by weight 100 parts by weight of the polyester polyol and hydrated alumina is also included in the reaction mixture. In a preferred embodiment, the hydrated alumina is predispersed in a mixture comprising the melamine deriva tive, the flame retardant and a low viscosity linear polyester polyol.
