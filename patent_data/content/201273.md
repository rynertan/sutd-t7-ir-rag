# Holographic apparatus

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a holographic apparatus, for recording and storing a hologram, of the type comprising a storage means 10 including a plurality of storage sections 10A, 10B, 10C arranged in a plane 27 for storing a hologram, and recording means including means 11 for generating an input modulated beam of light 13 , an optical system for directing the modulated beam of light onto the storage means, and means 14 for generating a reference beam of light 15 and for directing the reference beam of light onto the storage means so that it interferes with the modulated beam 13 and generates and records and stores in a selected one of the storage sections a hologram representing the modulation of the input modulated beam of light. Holographic apparatus in accordance with the invention is characterised in that the optical system comprises a set of parabolic reflecting surfaces 12A, 12B, 12C positioned with their common focus F1 coinciding with the modulated beam generating means 11 , so that the modulated beam 13 strikes all the storage sections 10A, 10B, 10C substantially at right angles to the plane 27 of the storage sections and the lengths L of the paths 13A, 13B, 13C of the modulated beam from said modulated beam generating means to each of the storage sections are equal.
