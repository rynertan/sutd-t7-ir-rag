# Image sensor.

## Abstract
A linear image sensor of a self scanning type comprising a phototransistor array 34a 37b and a scanning circuit, whose circuit comprises decoders of current switches 19 25 connected dendritically, input signal converter circuits Fi gure 1a generating input signals for driving the current switches 19 25 , and a current switch array 30 33b which turns on or off charging currents to the phototransistors according to whether or not an output current of decoder exists, so that video signals from the phototransistors 34a 37b , when the output currents of decoder flow, are obtainable from the phototransistors 34a 37b in the charge storage mode, all the transistors for scanning circuit being operated in non saturation condition for high speed opera tion and the input signals being encoded so that the input signals to the decoder vary by one bit at each scanning step for noise reduction. A cancellation circuit for the dark signal and noise signals is also provided.
