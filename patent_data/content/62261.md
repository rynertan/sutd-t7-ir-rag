## Description
Process for Isomerizing a Halogenated TolueneBackground of the Invention This invention relates to a process for the catalytic isomerization of halogenated toluenes. The term halogenated toluenes herein involves toluenes monohalogen substituted on their nuclei, more particularly, isomers of o halogenated toluene, m halogenated toluene and p halogenated toluene. The term halogen involves chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine. Generally, halogenated toluenes are obtained by nuclear substitution reaction of toluene with halogens. This halogenation reaction exhibits a strong ortho para orientation.Accordingly, if a m isomer of the halogenated toluene is required, it is necessary to isomerize o or p isomer. The proportion of the respective isomers of a halosenated toluene demanded is different from roportion of them formed by the halogenation in many cases. Therefore, an isomerization method has an important technical significance also for the effective utilization of the halogenated toluene. As an isomerization reaction, there have been know, for example, a method wherein aluminium chloride or the like is used as a catalyst as disclosed in G.A. Olah, J. Org. Chem. 27, 3464 1964 and a method wherein HF BF3 in used as a catalyst as disclosed in Japanese PatentPublication No. 11809 1971. However, these known isomerization methods are not preferred as industrial isomerization methods, since they have problems that the catalytic activity is insufficient, a long reaction time is required, a large amount of the catalyst is necessitated, the reaction device is corroded and the separation of the reaction product from the catalyst is difficult. After investigations made for the purpose of overcoming these defects of the conventional methods and establishing an industrially advantageous process for isomerizing halogenated toluenes, the inventors found previously that acid zeolites have remarkable effects. Generally, in an industrial process comprising the catalytic isomerization reaction carried out in the presence of a solid acid catalyst such as an acid zeolite, it is important that the catalyst has a sufficient activity and selectivity and also that the catalytic activity is main tained for a long period of time or, in other words, deterioration of the catalytic activity with time must be only slight. The catalytic isomerization method wherein a solid acid catalyst such as an acid zeolite is used has been employed widely on an industrial scale in the isomerization of parafinic hydrocarbons, olefinic hydrocarbons and alkylaromatic hydrocarbons.However, in these isomerization processes, the catalytic activity is one rally deteriorated with reaction time and, therefore, the activity must be maintained by elevating the reaction temperature as the catalytic activity is deterioratedwith time and when the reaction temperature has reached the highest temperature allowed in the isomerization reaction, the catalyst is regenerated or discharged. Thus, in case the deterioration of catalytic activity with time is serious, the reaction condition temperature must be altered or the regeneration must be effected frequently, whereby the operation becomes troublesome. Further, cost of the regeneration or the catalyst becomes high. Thus,the above mentioned processes are not yet satisfactory industrial processes. The deterzoration of catalytic activity with time in the isomerization reaction carried out in the presence of the above mentioned solid acid catalyst is caused by the following reasons 1 deposition of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface, 2 denaturation of the active site due to thermal history, etc., and 3 poisoning by catalyst poisons. Among the above mentioned reasons, the deposition of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface is responsible for the deterioration to the highest degree in general. In the catalytic isomerization process wherein a solid acid catalyst is used, the reaction is carried out generally in a gas phase in the presence of hydrogen so as to prevent the deterioration of catalytic activity with time due to the deposition of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface or the reaction is carried out in a liquid phase so as to wash away the carbonaceous precursors from the catalyst surface by the reaction liquid itself.However, it has been found that in the conventional processes for the catalytic isomerization of halogenated toluenes carried out in the presence of an acid zeolite catalyst, the deterioration of the isomerization activity with time is serious and that such processes are unsatisfactory industrially. An object of the present invention is to overcome this defect of the conventional method.Summary of the Invention It has been found by the present inventors that the deterioration of isomerization activity with time can remarkably be prevented by using a specific compound as a diluent. The present invention has been attained on the basis of this finding. The present invention provides a process for isomerizing a halogenated toluene by contacting the halogenated toluene with an acid zeolite, characterized in that the isomerization is carried out in the presence of one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of benzene, alkylbenzenes and halogenated benzenes, a weight ratio of the compound s to the halogenated toluene being 1 20 to 20 1. Brief Description of Drawings Figs. 1 and 2 show the results obtained in Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2. In these figures, feeds A, B and D contain a diluent and feeds C and E are free of any diluent.Detailed Description of the Invention In the isomerization process of the present invention, it is an indispensable condition that at least one compound selected from the group consisting of benzene, alkylbenzenes and halogenated benzenes is used as a diluent in the isomerization reaction. The alkylbenzenes used in the present invention are those having 1 4 alkyl groups having 1 2 carbon atoms , and when two or more alkyl groups are contained, they may be the same as or different from one another.As the alkylbenzenes, there may be mentioned, for example, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, diethylbenzene, ethyitoluene and trimethylbenzene.The halogenated benzenes are those having 1 4 halogen atoms, the halogen being fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, and when two or more halogen atoms are contained, they may be the same as or different from one another.As the halogenated benzenes, there may be mentioned, for example, fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, iodobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dibromobenzene and bromochlorobenzene. In industrial processes, it is preferable that diluents used in the reaction satisfy the following conditions 1 boiling point of the diluent is not close to those of the reactants and products, so that the diluent can easily be separated from the latter, and 2 side reactions such as decomposition are not easily caused under the isomerization reaction conditions and by products which cannot be separated easily from the reactants and products are not formed. However, boiling points of halogenated toluenes vary depending on the halogen contained therein and, in addition, they have various isomerization reactivities. Therefore, the optimum.reaction conditions are various. Thus, the diluent should be selected depending on variety of the halogenated toluenes. For example, in case chlorotoluene is used as the halogenated toluene, preferred diluents are benzene, toluene and chlorobenzene. Among them, benzene is particularly preferred. The diluents may be used either alone or as a mixture of two or more of them. In either case, the diluent should be used in the isomerization in such an amount that a weight ratio of the diluent to the halogenated toluene is 1 20 to 20 1. If the weight ratio of diluent to halogenated toluene is less than 1 20, the effect of preventing the deterioration of catalytic activity with time is insufficient. On the other hand, even if said weight ratio is increased above 20 1, the effect of preventing the deterioration of catalytic activity with time is not substantially increased any more and rather the increase in quantity of the liquid in the isomerization process increases the energy consumption unfavorably. A preferred weight ratio of the diluent to the halogenated toluene is 1 5 to 5 1. As for the zeolites used in the present invention, any natural and synthetic zeolites having such a pore diameter that the halogenated toluene is diffusible thereinto under the reaction conditions may be used. No particular limitation is made also on the crystalline structures of the zeolites. However, if an atomic ratio of Si to Al in the zeolite is too low, the acid strength is low and the isomerization activity is also low unfavorably, since the zeolite used in the isomerization reaction according to the present invention acts as a solid acid catalyst.Preferred zeolites are those having an atomic ratio ofSi to Al of at least 2. As preferred zeolites, there may be mentioned, for example, mordenite and ZSM 5 type zeolites having main cavities with openings constituted by a 10 membered oxygen ring. Among them, ZSM 5 type zeolites are particularly preferred. The term ZSM 5 type zeolites herein involves zeolite ZSM 5 and zeolites considered to be analogous to it. The composition and process for the production of zeolite ZSM 5 are disclosed in the specification of.U.S. Patent No. 3,894,106 and its crystalline structure is described in Nature 271, 30 March, 437 1978 . As such zeolites, there may be mentioned, in addition to said Zg S, for example, ZSM 8 disclosed in the specification of British Patent No.. 1,334,243, ZSM ll disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent Publication No.23280 1978, ZSM 21 disclosed in the specification ofU.S. Patent No 4,001,346, ZSg 35 disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 144,500 1978, zeolite Z zeta 1 disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 67299 1976, zeolite Z zeta 3 disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent LaidOpen No 6X,298 1976 and zeolite disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent Application No. 189719 81. Among these ZSM 5 type zeolites, the last one is the most preferable. It is a novel crystallin aluminosilicate zeolite having the X ray diffraction pattern of Table 1 and can be prepared by a following method.An aqueous reaction mixture consisting of silica source, an alumina source, an alkali source and an organic compound having at least one carboxlyl group is prepared in such a manner that it is within some particular composition range.Then, the aqueous reaction mixture is reacted until crystals of zeolite are formed.

In the process of the present invention, the zeolites are used in acid form. As well known1 acid zeolites contain a proton or polyvalent cation having a valence of at least 2 such as a rare earth ion. They are obtained by ion exchanging at least part of monovalent alkali metal ion such as sodium with proton or polyvalent cation or by ion exchanging the same with an ammonium cation followed by converting into a proton by calcination. A ZSM 5 type zeolite generally contains an organic nitroten containing cation and so is calcined to decompose the organic nitrogencontaining cation and to give proton, whereby an acid zeolite is obtained. Any of those zeolites having an acidity required for the isomerization reaction of the halogenated toluene may be used in the presen invention irrespective of the variety or amount of the cation. The zeolites are used generally in the agglomerated form in the isomerization process of the present invention. The aggromeration method is not particularly limited and known methods such as rolling, extrusion and compression methods may by employed. If necessary, a binder such as alumina sol and caly may be incorporated therewith in the agglomerating operation. The ion exchange may be effected either before or after the agglomeration of the zeolite. The zeolite articles thus formed are activated by calcining them generally at 300 700 C to form the catalyst. In the isomerization process of the present invention, at least one halogenated toluene selected from the group consisting of o , m and p halosenated toluenes having no thermodynamically equilibrium composition is catalytically isomerized in the presence of the acid zeolite prepared as above in the coexistence of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of benzene, alkylbenzenes and halogenated benzenes. The reaction can be carried out according to known isomerization processes in the coexistence of the abovementioned diluent s . Satisfactory results can be obtained in either a gas phase or a liquid phase. In the gas phase reaction, it is more preferred that the reaction is carried out in the coexistence of also hydrogen gas. Any of fixed bed, moving bed and fluidized bed systems may be employed. The fixed bed flow system is preferred for the reaction from the viewpoint of easiness of the operation, since the catalytic activity is maintained for a long period of time in this systemaccording to the process of the present invention. The reaction temperature is generally about 150 5000C, particularly 200 400 C. The reaction pressure is not particularly limited, though, as a matter of course, it should be controlled so as to maintain the reaction system in a liquid state depending on varieties of the halogenated toluene and diluent. Weight hourly space velocity WIiSV based on a halogenated toluene is 0.05 30 her , preferably 0.1 20 hr According to the process of the present invention, selectivity in the isomerization reaction is also improved in addition to the effect of preventing the deterioration of isomerization activity of the halogenated toluene with time. Transalkylation or transhalogenation reaction occurs in the isomerization reaction of the halogenated toluene like the isomerization reaction of an alkylaromatic hydrocarbon such as xylene. However, these side reactions can be controlled by the addition of the above mentioned diluent in the isomerization reaction. The following examples will further illustrate the present invention.Example 1 Zeolite ZSM 5 powder having a SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of 45.5 was synthesized according to a method disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent Laid Open No.54598 1975. 15 wt. as A1203 of alumina sol was added to the ZSM 5 powder. The whole was kneaded, extruded to obtain 14 24 mesh pellet and calcined at 5000C for 2 h in air. The pellet of ZSM 5 was ion exchanged 5 times using 10 wt. aqueous ammonium chloride solution solid liquid ratio 2.0 11keg, at about 90 C , washed thoroughly with water, dried at 1200C for 15 h and calcined at 500 CC for 2 h in air to obtain an acidZSM 5 catalyst. The isornerization reaction of o chlorotoluene O CT was carried out using the acid ZSM 5 catalyst in a gas phase in a fixed bed flow reactor while a mixture of chlorobenzene CB and O CT feed A and a mixture of benzene Bz and O CT feed B were fed by turns by means of a changing switch.
