## Description
Vascular Prosthesis Vascular Prosthesis The subject of this invention is a vascular prosthesis and particularly a prosthesis in the form of a knitted tube to be used as a graft for replacing a portion of a blood vessel in a human or animal body. In the formation of a prosthesis formed as a substitute blood vessel it is essential that various characteristics of the prosthesis should be predeterminable. One of the most important characteristics to be predetermined is the degree of porosity. The pores of such a prosthesis must be of a size to suit the particular medical condition of the proposed recipient of the prosthesis. There are other characteristics which should also be predetermined, for example, the relative smoothness of the surfaces of the prosthesis, the density of the structure and its flexibility. As in the case of porosity, the degree of relative smoothness of the surface and the density are dictated by the particular degree of tissue response required of the respective surfaces of the prosthesis after implantation.Varying degrees of flex ibility are required to ensure that on implantation the prosthesis will conform to the anatomical situation at the site of implantation. Hitherto in the manufacture of knitted vascular prostheses it has not been possible to make significant changes to any one ofthese characteristics without adversely affecting one tor more of the others. It would be of great advantage in the manufacture of knitted vascular prostheses if it were possible to vary substantially independently, all the characteristics of a prosthesis referred to above because at present, by the known methods of manufacture, the characteristics of such prostheses are to a large degree a matter of compromise. A further disadvantage present in known knitted vascular prostheses is that it has been necessary, prior to implantation, to pre clot the prosthesis to be implanted.By the expression pre clot or pre clotting is meant the step during surgery on the recipient of soaking the prosthesis in blood, normally the patient s blood or in certain circumstances donor blood of the same group until clot formation occurs on the surface of the prosthesis. In the implantation of known knitted vascular prostheses such pre clotting reduces the amount of blood lost by seepage through the knitted structure after implantation. The step is necessary because known knitted vascular prostheses cannot exhibit a degree of porosity low enough to avoid serious blood loss after implantation.It would be a significant advance if the operating time and loss of blood by the patient necessarily associated with the pre clotting step could be eliminated or significantly reduced. It is an object of the present invention to provide a vascular prosthesis in which the various characteristics are independently predeterminable to a much greater extent than has been the case heretofore. It is a further object of this invention to provide a knitted vascular prosthesis having interstices of a pre determinable size small enough to reduce blood loss during the surgical procedure but large anough to allow cell migration through the structure of the prosthesis after implantation and which allows the pre clotting step to be reduced or in certain cases eliminated. A vascular prosthesis according to the invention comprises an integrated knitted tubular structure in which the wall of the tube is composed of several strata of which each stratum has characteristics different from those of at least one of the other strata. The prosthesis may be knitted from several yarns at least two of which have specific characteristics different from one another with one chosen yarn in preponderance in the stratum presenting the outer surface of the tubular structure and another chosen yarn in a preponderance in the stratum presenting the inner surface of the tubular structure and at least one other yarn forms at least one stratum between the other two strata. In one example of such a prosthesis formed of three yarns two of the yarns are formed of polyester and one is formed of polytetrafluoroethane usually referred to as PTFE, the knit being such that polyester yarn forms the stratum providing the preponderance of polyester at the outer surface and the PTFE yarn forms the stratum providing the preponderance ofPTFE at the inner surface. Other yarns which may be used to form particular strata are carbon fibres, polypropylene, polyurethane and some grades of natural rubber, also yarns chosen from the class of yarns known as spandex yarns. It has been found that three yarns are effective in most situations in making a prosthesis with chosen characteristics but it is to be understood that more than three yarns may be used in special circumstances. A method of manufacturing a prosthesis according to the invention comprises feeding several yarns to the needles of a knitting machine of the two needle bed type with the chosen yarns being fed to the needles of one bed and the other yarn or yarns being fed to the needles of the other bed. Different yarns fed to the same needle bed may be fed with different tensions, the tensions in the different yarns fed to the same needle being such that the yarn to be in preponderance in the surface stratum to be formed by that needle bed is the yarn fed with the least tension. In one particular method of manufacture separate stratified flat structures are knitted simultaneously back to back and are knitted together along the selvedges to form the required tubular structure. This operation may be performed in a knitting machine with two double needle beds arranged back to back, the knitting operation being performed immediately the two strips are formed on their own needle beds. The finished tubular structure may be formed with circumferential corrugations. A diagrammatic longitudinal section to a greatly enlarged scale through a vascular prosthesis according to the invention is illustrate in the accompanying drawing which shows a tubular structure in the form of an uncorrugated tube. In the drawings 1 denotes a tube having an inner wall surface 2 and an outer wall surface 3. The wall itself presents three integrated strata 4, 5 and 6 which merge with one another without any definite dividing line between them. The three strata are formed from three yarns knitted together with different tensions as already described to provide that the stratum 4 consists of the material which preponderates on the outer surface e.g. polyester, the stratum 6 is the stratum in which the inner surface material preponderates e.g.PTFE and the stratum 5 contains the material of the third yarn mixed with a certain amount of the material of the yarn of the stratum 4 and the yarn of the stratum 6. The different tensions for the yarns forming these strata are chosen to give the desired characteristics to these strata and the desired proportions of the particular materials required for these strata. By varying the proportions of the tension one to the other it is possible to vary the overall characteristics for example of porosity of the tubular structure while the characteristics of the individual strata can also be varied to give specific characteristics according to the positions of the strata in the tubular structure itself. By this means it is possible to make a composite tubular structure which satisfies a large number of exacting chosen requirements. By existing methods of manufacture that has not been heretofore possible and known grafts have all been to some extent a compromise in their characteristics.
