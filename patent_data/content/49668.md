# Method and apparatus for conducting logging or perforating operations in a borehole.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for conducting logging or perforating operation in a borehole, particularly a deviated borehole, includes lowering a length of drill pipe having the well logging tool or well bore perforator releasably mounted thereon into the borehole. An extension member, which is also lowered through the drill pipe, is secured to the well logging tool or well bore perforator and releases it from the drill pipe, whereupon the extension member and well logging tool or well bore perforator are moved through the borehole. The apparatus includes a latching sub mounted to the end of the length of drill pipe, and a latching head releasably mounted within the latching sub for releasably holding a well logging tool or well bore perforator within the latching sub.
