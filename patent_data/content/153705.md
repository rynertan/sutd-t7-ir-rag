# Modified wheat b starch for corrugating adhesives.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to second grade starches and wheat B starches in particular which, following conventional modification treatments to produce a corres pondingly viscosity reduced starch, are especially useful in the production of Stein Hall corrugating adhesives. Corru gated paper board products manufactured using such adhe sives have improved properties. In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a modified wheat B starch wherein aqueous dispersions of the modified B starch have reduced viscosities relative to comparable dispersions of a corresponding unmodified wheat B starch, the reduced viscosity not being less than about 12 centipoise grams per cubic centimeter for a specified dispersion.
