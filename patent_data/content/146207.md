## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS The present invention relates to electrical components and more particularly to electrical components which are encapsulated sometimes called potted in an outer covering in order to provide environmental protection. The invention is specifically concerned with the encapsulation of electrical components having one or more external parts which are movable, such as movable contacts, or temperature responsive devices, for example as are described in our copending British applicationNo, 8324174. It has been found that when it is attempted to encapsulate such electrical components employing known techniques, the encapsulating material may thereafter inhibit the operation of the movable contacts or members thereby preventing the proper operation of such devices, e.g. the proper operation of an overheating protection device. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the encapsulation of electrical components in which the aforementioned disadvantage is substantially reduced or avoided. The present invention provides a process for the encapsulation of an electrical component provided with at least one external movable contact or other rember wherein the component is first coated with a wax like material which is allowed to solidify and the resulting wax coated assembly is then encapsulated in the desired encapsulating material. As applied to an electrical component in which the externally movable contacts or members comprise a temperature responsive device such as an overheating protection device, the wax like coating is of a wax which melts at a temperature below the operating temperature of the overheating protection device. The process according to the present invention may be carried out by immersing the component in a molten wax, for example paraffin wax, withdrawing the component from the molten wax to allow the wax coating thereon to solidify, suspending the wax coated component in a mould or potting box and pouring an encapsulating material into the mould or potting box to completely cover the assembly, curing or solidifying the encapsulant and removing the encapsulated component from the mould or potting box.Alternatively, the molten wax may be in a temporary mould in which the component is located until the wax has solidified in order to provide a relatively thick wax coating of desired configuration. The temporary mould may be force cooled to aid solidification of the wax. It will thus be seen that the encapsulated electrical component comprises the basic component covered with a thick layer or film of solidified wax and completely enclosed within an encapsulant. Since the melting point of the wax is always lower than the operating temperature of the overheating protection device, when the protection device reaches its operating temperature, it will be surrounded by molten wax which offers little or no mechanical resistance to the movements of the elements of the protection device. Most of the known commercially available waxes may be employed which are reasonably chemically inert, which are solid at room temperature and which melt at a comparatively low temperature, for example 400 to 700. The encapsulant may include most of the epoxy casting resins, silicone resins, polyester resins or polyurethanes, although those producing strong exothermic reactions should be avoided in the case of temperature responsive devices. In such cases the curing temperature of the encapsulant is lower than that of the wax employed. According to one specific example, an electrical component provided with a temperature responsive device forming an overheating protection device of the type disclosed in our aforementioned copending application 8324174 was encapsulated by initially dipping the component in a bath of paraffin wax having a melting point of about 450C, and which was held just above this temperature. The overheating protection device had an operating temperature in the region of 1750C which is well above the melting temperature of the wax. The component was then withdrawn from the bath of wax and the wax coating was allowed to solidify. The waxcoated component was then encapsulated in a polyurethane material by placing it into a mould and pouring the polyurethane into the mould to completely cover the assembly.The polyurethane material had a curing temperature of 25 to 30 C. The encapsulated component was then removed from the mould, it being understood that during the coating and encapsulation process, the wire lead outs or terminals from the component were maintained free of coatings. One embodiment of an encapsulated component according to the invention is shown in the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a side view partly in section, and Fig. 2 is a cross section through the encapsulated component. The component 1 is a gas discharge tube or surge voltage arrestor incorporating an overheating protection device generally indicated at 5 and of the kind generally disclosed in our aforementioned copending application.The component 1 is surrounded by a relatively thick layer of paraffin wax 2 and the resulting assembly is itself encapsulated in a polyurethane material 3 with the connecting leads 4 to the component projecting free of encapsulation. The melting point of the wax 2 is well below the operating temperature of the overheating protection device, so if the component reaches an overheated temperature at which the device needs to operate, the wax will then have melted or at least softened sufficiently to allow the temperature responsive contacts of the overheating protection device 5 to operate. In other words, the provision of the wax layer 2 prevents the encapsulant from adhering to the overheating protection device contacts such as to prevent it from operating when required. Since the wax when molten offers little or no mechanical resistance to the movements of the overheating protection device, it is free to move when the wax melts. Whilst a particular embodiment has been described, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of this invention.Thus it will be obvious that the invention may clearly be applied to other electrical components besides that specifically described and the moving contacts need not be an overheating protection device. Moreover other waxes and encapsulants may be used, providing that the melting point of the selected wax is lower than the operating temperature of the overheating protection device, is compatible with the material of the encapsulant and that curing temperature of the selected encapsulant is lower than the melting point of the wax selected.
