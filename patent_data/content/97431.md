# Improvements relating to heat exchangers.

## Abstract
A motor vehicle radiator has a tubular oil cooler 12 located in its header tank defined by a plastics header tank shell 11 and a tube plate 20. Passage of oil to the oil cooler is effected through connectors 14 which include an elastomeric sealing bush 16 which is tapered internally in its undeformed state such that upon insertion of a connecting piece 15 the bush is expanded radially outwardly into sealing contact with the header tank shell.
