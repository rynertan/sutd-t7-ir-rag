## Description
METHOD OF SEPARATING ONE GAS FROM A MIXTURE OF GASES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA. Field of the Invention This invention relates to methods for recovering one gas from a mixture of gases.B. Prior Art. It is known that permeable membranes can be used to separate certain gases from mixtures of those and other gases. The gas mixture is brought into contact with one side of the membrane and the more permeable gas permeates the membrane and is recovered from the other side thereof.The purity of and rate at which the one gas is recovered depends on a number of factors. Some of the factors which influence the rate of recovery and purity of the permeated gas are the permeability of the membrane for the one gas as compared to the other gases of the mixture, the difference in partial pressures of the one gas across the membrane, the effective surface area of the membrane and the flow rate of the gas mixture. Since certain of these factors, such as flow rate and gas mixture pressure, are often variable in nature, the rate of recovery and or purity of the one gas is subject to variation. This variation is likely to have an upsetting effect on a subsequent process where the permeated gas stream is utilized and where the characteristics of that gas stream must be maintained within certain limits.It would be desirable to have a process where one gas is recovered from Ã¢ mixture of that and at least one other gas under conditions such that the purity of the recovered gas may be adjusted to a desirable constant value at varying mixture supply and or recovered gas usage rates. Frequently, the permeated gas is used in another process where a constant purity at a variable rate of usage is required. In known permeation systems the purity of the permeated gas fluctuates with changes in rate of recovery, so that these systems are unsuited for use where purity must remain constant as the rate of recovery is changed.The process of the present invention provides a recovered gas stream having a constant purity at varying rates of recovery and usage. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A method for separating one gas from a mixture of gases at a constant purity and a variable recovery rate wherein the gas mixture is passed through a heat exchanger to a plurality of permeators, each of the permeators being provided with a membrane more permeable to the one gas than the other gases of the mixture. In order to maintain a constant purity at a variable rate of recovery and usage of the separated one gas, the temperature of the gas mixture is varied prior to its contact with the membrane to vary the permeability of the one gas to thus vary the recovery rate within a range of recovery rates while maintaining a constant recovered gas purity.The number of permeators connected to the source and in use is changed to select another range of recovery rates when variation of the temperature of the gas mixture to a predetermined temperature within the range of 20 to 80 C is not sufficient to maintain a constant purity at the desired rate of recovery and usage of the permeated gas. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRANINGS Figure 1 is a schematic view showing apparatus carrying out the process of the present invention. Figure 2 is a chart showing rates of gas permeation using varying numbers of permeators at varying gas temperatures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now in detail to the drawing, there is shown in Figure 1 a plurality of permeators 11., 12, 13, and 14 connected in parallel through a line 17 to a source 18 of a mixture of gases containing one gas, such as hydrogen, which is to be recovered. Connected in the line 17 between the source 18 and the permeators 11 14 is a heat exchanger 19 of a known type which is provided for the purpose of varying the temperature of the gas mixture entering the permeators. Each of the permeators 11 1 is provided with a permeable membrane which is preferably in the form of a bundle of hollow fibers 22 which are suitable for separating one gas from other gases of the mixture.Preferably, the hollow fibers used are fibers such as those disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,230,463. The permeators 11 14 are so constructed that the gas mixture is brought into contact with the exterior surfaces of the fibers 22 and the non permeating gases are withdrawn from the permeators through a line 23. The gas which permeates the fibers 22 to the bores or interiors thereof is recovered from the permeators 11 14 through lines 31, 32, 33 and 3 , respectively, which lead to a common discharge line 36 which carries away the recovered or permeated gas. This permeated gas may be used in a downstream process which requires the gas at a varying rate and a constant purity. The lines 32, 33 and 34 are provided with valves 42, 43 and 44, respectively, which can be closed to prevent gas from the respective permeators from reaching the discharge line 36. These valves are connected to and controlled by a sensing and control device 46 of a well known type connected in the line 36 for sensing the rate of recovery of the permeated gas. The purpose of the sensing and control device 46 is to sense the rate of permeation or recovery of the permeated gas and to vary the rate of recovery of the permeated gas to maintain its purity at a constant value.The permeators 12, 13 and 14 are Tconnectable to the source 18 in the sense that closing of the valves 42 44 has the same effect as disconnecting the permeators 12 14, respectively, from the source 18 while opening the valves 42 44 has the same effect as connecting the permeators 12 4 to the source 18. The sensing device 46 is not only connected to actuate the valves 42 44 but is also connected to the heat exchanger 19 to control the operation of this heat exchanger to vary the temperature of the gas mixture being fed to the permeators in response to sensed variations in the permeated gas recovery rate. It will be readily seen from Figure 2 that varying the temperature of the gas mixture varies the rate of recovery of the more permeable gas within a fixed range of recovery rates, while changing the number of permeators connected to the source 18 selects a new range of recovery rates. The manner of carrying out the process of the present invention can best be understood by reference to Figure 2.Figure 1 shows four permeators, while Figure 2 illustrates the use of six permeators. The straight lines in Figure 2 illustrate the amount of permeated gas recovered per hour, in standard cubic meters, using a specified number of permeators and at various temperatures. The number appearing at the right hand of each of the straight lines is the number of permeators which are used to achieve the range of recovery rates illustrated by that straight line. It should be understood that Figure 2 is included for purposes of illustration and that the positioning and slopes of the lines in Figure 2 are representative of a particular installation involving the recovery of a particular gas. In other illustrations where1 for example, different gases and different membranes or membrane areas are involved, other families of lines would be appropriate. These other families of lines will have the general positioning and arrangement of the lines shown in Figure 2. In operation, the first permeator 11 remains connected to the source 18 and the sensing device 46 senses the amount of permeated gas recovered through the line 36. If the amount of permeated gas desired is relatively small, the sensing device 46 maintains the valves 42 44 in a closed position and controls the heat exchanger 19 to vary the temperature of the gas passing through the line 17 to maintain the permeate gas passing through line 36 at a desired rate within a range of recovery rates. The lowermost line, indicated by reference numeral 1, in Figure 2 illustrates this operation. If a higher rate of recovery of the permeated gas within a given range is desired, the temperature of the gas passing through the line 17 is increased by the heat exchange 19, under the control of the sensing device 46, until the recovery rate reaches the desired value. If the temperature of the gas is increased to about 80 0C and the rate of recovery is still below the desired value, then the sensing device 42 opens the valve 32 to connect the permeator 12 to the source 18 to thereby select another range of recovery rates, using both permeators 11 and 12.Operation at this stage is represented by line 2 in Figure 2. When the permeator 12 is connected to the source 18 it is probable that it will be necessary to operate the heat exchanger 19 to vary the temperature of the gas mixture entering the permeators 11 and 12 to a lower value. The fibers 22 used in the permeators 11 14 are preferably multicomponent membranes in the form of hollow fibers made from a polysulfone polymer, as described in detail in U. S. Patent No. 4,230,463. Preferably, the fibers will have a separation factor of at least 10 for hydrogen over other gases of the mixture from the source It and a hydrogen permeability of at least about fxfO 6 cubic centimeters of hydrogen per square centimeter of fiber surface at a pressure of 1 centimeter of mercury across the wall of the filament. The permeators 11 14 may be constructed as shown inU. S. Patent No. 4,220,535 or other U. S. patents. In this construction, the membrane is in the form of a plurality of hollow fibers which are enclosed in a tubular shell such that the gas mixture can be admitted to the shell to come into contact with the outer surfaces of the fibers. The more permeable gas of the mixture will permeate the walls of the fibers to the interiors or bores thereof and be recovered from these bores. In some cases the desired rate of recovery may be a constant rate. In this case the process can be used to take into account varying gas mixture flow characteristics, such as varying flow rates or pressures, to maintain the rate of recovery at the desired constant value. In the usual case, however, the desired recovery rate is a rate which varies from time to time as downstream demand varies.This variation in recovery rate is accomplished in the present invention by varying the temperature of the gas mixture passing through the permeators to vary the recovery rate within a range of recovery rates and by varying the number of permeators connected to the source to select a different range of recovery rates when varying the gas mixture temperatures to a value within the range of 20 to 0 80 C, preferably 40 to 70at, is insufficient to maintain the desired recovery rate. Of course, it is not necessary that the gas mixture temperature be varied to the end of the specified range prior to varying the number of permeators in use. In many cases it will be preferred to vary the.number of permeators in use to select a different recovery range such that less heating of the gas mixture will be required to provide the desired recovery rate. In this case, the sensing device 45 can be set to vary the number of permeators when the gas mixture has been varied to some predetermined value within the range of 20 to SOOC without achieving the desired rate of recovery. For example, for energy conservation or other reasons, it may be desirable in some cases to avoid heating the gas mixture above a predetermined temperature within the range of 20 800C.Assume, for example, that this predetermined temperature is 50 C. Then the sensing device 46 would be set to connect another permeator to the source 18 when the gas mixture reaches 500 C and a still higher recovery rate is desired. This would conserve energy by achieving the desired recovery rate without the necessity of heating the gas mixture above 50 C. It should be noted that lesser variations in recovery rate are achieved by varying the temperature of the gas mixture, while greater variations in the recovery rate are achieved by changing the number of permeators connected to the source. Changing the number of permeators connected to the source 18 changes the range of rate of recovery while changing the temperature of the gas mixture varies the rate of recovery within a range to achieve the precise recovery rate desired. When the gas temperature is increased to the upper 0 limit of the range of 20 to 80 C and the rate of recovery is still insufficient, the sensing device 46 will, unless it has been set to some predetermined temperature below 0 80 C, then act to connect another permeator to the source 18. Conversely, if the temperature of the gas is adjusted downward to the lower end of the range of 20 to 80 C, preferably 400 C to 700 C, and the rate of recovery is still undesirably high, the sensing device 46 will act to disconnect one of the permeators from the source 18 by closing the valve associated therewith. In most cases it will be necessary to vary the gas mixture temperature downward when an additional permeator is put into use and to vary the gas mixture temperature upward when the number of permeators in use is reduced, especially where only a small change is desired in the rate of recovery. From Figure 2 it can readily be seen that the rate of recovery can be varied greatly when both the gas mixture temperature and the effective membrane are changed, the effective membrane area being changed when the number of permeators connected to the source 18 is hanged. For example in the installation represented by the family of lines in Figure 2, the recovery rate can be varied from about 500 m3 hr. to well above 5,000 m3 hr., all at a substantially constant purity of the recovered gas. The preferred use of this invention is in the separation of hydrogen from mixtures containing other gases which are less permeable than hydrogen. Some of the gases which have significantly slower permeating rates with a given membrane, compared to gases such as hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, are methane and other hydrocarbon gases, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, etc.
