# Method and system for reducing conference bridge oscillations.

## Abstract
Undesired oscillations in a communications confe rencing network are reduced and or eliminated by fre quency shifting signals passing through the conferencing network by a small amount for each pass therethrough. Electrical information signals from a plurality of indi vidual communication sets S1, S2...SN are individually summed, frequency shifted by a predetermined amount, and coupled back to individual ones of the communica tions sets S1, S2...SN , less their individual signal contri butions. Frequency shifting can be performed on analog electrical information signals by means 45 for modulating the sum signals, means 48 for filtering the modulated sig nals, means 50 for remodulating the filtered signals with a second carrier signal train having a frequency which dif fers from the frequency of the first carrier signal train by a predetermined amount, and means 54 for filtering the sig nals resulting from the second modulating step. Frequency shifting on digital information signals is performed by means 101 for digitally expanding the spec tral range of the sum signals to provide a plurality of repli cas of the spectral content of the signals distributed over a wide spectral range, means 102 for digitally filtering the expanded signals to filter out predetermined portions of the expanded range, means 103 for digitally shifting the fre quency of the remaining replicas by a second expansion, and means 104 for digitally filtering the frequency shifted replicas to filter out unwanted portions of the shifted spec trum.
