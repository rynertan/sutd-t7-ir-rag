## Description
SELECTIVE SEPARATION OF NOBLE METALS Field of the Invention This invention relates to a process for selectively separating noble metals from solutions containing such noble metals and more particularly to a process for selectively separating said noble metals from solutions containing such noble metals by utilizing solid supports bearing amine functions appropriaptly spaced and under acidic pH conditions of from about pH .5 to about 2.5. Background of the Invention It has heretofore been recognized that various methods are available for separating metals from solutions. However, it is highly desirable that an extraction method be available whereby noble metals may be selectively extracted from solutions containing both noble metals and base and transition metals.Heretofore, in order to selectively separate noble metals from base and transition metals, it has been necessary to employ a chelating agent which contains functional groups capable of extended resonance, such as for example, as disclosed by Roster, G. and Scmucler, G., Analytica Chemica Acta 38 179 184 1967 . It has now been found that it is not nieces sary to employ a chelating agent which contains func tional groups capable of extended resonance in order to selectively separate noble metals. Summary of the Invention It has now been unexpectedly discovered that by utilizing solid support bearing amine functions appropriately spaced and under acidic pH conditions of from about pH 0.5 to 2.5 noble metals may be selectively separated from base and transition metals. Details of the Invention It has surprisingly been found that noble metals may be selectively separated by utilizing solid supports bearing amine functional groups appropriately spaced when acidic pH conditions of from about pH 0.5 to about 2.5 are employed. The solid supports suitable for use in the invention can be any suitable solid support such as. silica, alumina, cross linked resins such as polystyrene divinylbenzene resins and the like. It is only necessary that the solid support be inert to the environment of the metal, i.e. that it be unreactive and or insoluble, must not bind with metals non specifically and must be capable of being properly deriva tized with the appropriate amine bearing functionalities. Preferably the solid support is silica gel and most preferably column chromatography grade of about 4G micron size. The amine functional groups are attached to the solid support and have the following formula EMI2.1 wherein m is a whole integer of from 1 to 6, n is a whole integer of from 2 to 5, x is a whole integer of from 1 to 10, y is a whole integer of 1 to 3 and p is equal to 3 minus y, that is, 0, 1 or 2. Most preferably m is 3, n is 2 and x is 1. Such a most preferred bonded solid support is formed by the reaction of N 2aminoethyl 3 amino propyl trimethoxysilane with silica gel according to procedures known in the art, such as for example, as disclosed by Leyden, D.E., et al.,Analytical Letters, 8 11 51 56 1975 . Another pr ferred bonded solid support is that obtained by bonding trimethcxysilyl N propyl N polyethyleneimine having a molecular weight of about 500. Such solid supports bearing amine functions appropriately spaced specifically bind or retain noble metals from acidic solutions of pH frcD about 0.5 to 2.5, preferably about pH 1, while not binding or retaining base metals or transition metals. Nobles metals selectively bound by the process of this invention are defined as ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold and the Group lIB and VIIX metals in their hexavalent state, namely hexavalent chromium, molyb denim, wolfram, manganese, technetium and rhenium.The first seven listed noble metals constitute a pre ffflngroup of noble metals for which the process of this invention is useful. The noble metals can be selectively separated from either aqueous or organic solutions containing such noble .metals. The process of this invention may be employed to selectively separate noble metals that are present in trace levels, for example, from about 10 9 to 10 6 gold as well as at macro levels, for example, from about 10 3 to 10 2 g ml or even at higher levels. That is, the process is operable with either dilute or concentrated solutions. The noble metals may be selectively separated from solution by either a batch process wherein the solution containing the noble metals is in excess or by a column technique where the solid support phase is in excess. It will also be appreciated that the process of this inention is operable whether the noble metal to be selectively separated is in complexed or ionic form. The process of this invention has been found to be independent of the total volume of the solution containing the noble metals. and there is no limiting factor except for the amount of bonded solid support employed. That is, the process is operable so long as the capacity of the solid support is not surpassed and therefore has a high capacity. Moreover, the solid phase bearing the amine function appropriately spaced has such a high affinity for the noble metals at pH of from about 0.5 to 2.5 that the process may be employed in batch condition where the solution is in excess compared to the solid phase. In the following Examples I to VII the solid support used is a bonded phase of silica gel 40 mi cron size, column chromatography grade covalently bonded to N 2 aminoethyl 3 a.ninopropyl trimethoxysil ane. In Example VIII the solid support is a bonded phase of silica gel covalently bonded to trimethoxy silyl N propyl N polyethyleneamine. Example I Over chromatography columns containing about 1 gram of bonded phase solid support were passed by vacuum aspiration of about 20 ml mercury, 50 ml each of a pH 1 aqueous solution of ions of the elements listed below. The elements were present in the aqueous solutions at concentrations of from 0.65 to 0.2 mg ml. The following noble elements were completely absorbed 95 to 100 by the diamine bonded phase solid support ruthenium platinum rhodium palladium gold manganese VI osmium chromium VI wolfram VI iridium molybdenium VI rhenium VI technetium VI The following base or transition elements were not retained by the diamine bonded phase solid support cadmium cobalt silver cesium nickel mercury barium scandium thallium zinc lead arsenic chromium III beryllium bismuth manganese II copper selenium iron tellurium Example II A pH 1 solution containing 1 mg ml of carbonyl bistriphenylphosphine rhodium I chloride in benzene was passed over a column containing 1 gram of diamine bonded phase solid support by vacuum aspiration of about 20 ml mercury. The solution was continually passed through the column until breakthrough occurred.The amount retained by the solid phase in the column up to breakthrough is taken as the capacity of the column. A total of 75 mg of the rhodium complex was retained before rhodium appeared in the eluent. Example III A pH solution containing I mg ml of bistri phenylphosphine palladium II chloride in benzene was passed over a column containing 1 gram of diamine bonded phase solid support by vacuum aspiration of about 20 ml mercury. The solution was continually passed through the column until breakthrough occurred.A total of 201 mg of the palladium complex was retained before breakthrough occurred. Example IV An aqueous pH 1 solution ocntaining 4 mg ml of gold chloride was passed through a column as in Example II and 200 mg gold was retained before break through occurred, that is, before gold appeared in the eluent. The gold was readily removed from the column by washing with a 3 5 fold stoichiometric excess of 2N two3, IN HC1 using water aspiration. Example V A gold plating solution containing 200 ppm gold, 50 ppm copper, 10 ppm zinc, 10 ppm lead and 50 ppm nickel was adjusted to pH 1 with phosphoric acid and then passed over a column containing 100 mg of the diamine bonded phase solid support. 50 ml of the plating solution was passed over this column before gold was found in the eluent. The other metals were not retained. The gold was readily eluted using a 3 5 fold stoichiometric excess of 0.1N EC1. Example VI A gold plating solution containing 2000 ppm gold, 800 ppm cobalt, 50 ppm copper, 50 ppm nickel and 20 ppm iron was adjusted to pH 2.5 with phosphoric acid and then passed over a column containing 500 mg of the diamine bonded phase solid support. Breakthrough of the gold occurred at 25 ml. The only other metal retained at pH 2.5 was iron, which was subse auently selectively eluted off the column at ph 1.The gold was then eluted off with 3 5 fold stoichiometric excess 0.iN thioura, 0.IN Sic1. Example VII An 80 20 acetone water solution of the ions of nickel, copper and gold at concentrations of 1 mg ml was passed over a column containing 200 mg of the diamine bonded phase solid support. Only gold was retained, up to 12 ma before any qold appeared in the eluent. The gold was subsequently removed with 2N HCl 0.iN HNO3. Example VIII Example VII was repeated except the column contained 200 mg of wide pore, low surface area silica gel covalently bonded to trimethoxysilyl N prcpyl N polyethyleneimine. Only gold was retained, up to 8.4 mg before any gold appeared in the eluent. The gold was subsequently removed by 3 5 fold stoichiometric excess 0.1N thiourea, 0.iN HCl. While the N 2 aminoethyl 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane bonded to silica has been disclosed in the literature to complex base metal ions and transition metal ions, such as for example, as disclosed inLeyden, D.E. et al., Analytical Letters S 1 51 56 1975 , Burggraf, L.W. et al., Analytic ChemicaActa 129, 19 27 1981 , and Jenett H. et al., Presen ius Z. Anal. Chem. 304, 362 368 1980 , it was totally surprising to find that such diamine bonded phase solid support binds very strongly to all of the noble metals. Even more surprising was that the binding can be made totally selective for noble metals to the exclusion of base and transition metals by appropriate adjustment of the pe to a range of from about pE 0.5 to 2.5. The process of this invention finds many practical uses. Among the contemplated uses for the process of this invention those may be mentioned for example, recovering noble metals from industrial wastes, removing noble metals from plating solutions, separation and concentration of noble metals, preconcentration of noble metals, separating noble metals from sea water, recovery of noble metals from metal refinery wastes and the like
