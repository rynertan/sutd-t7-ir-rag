# Mechanism for cutting single thickness paper or like sheet material and apparatus including such mechanism.

## Abstract
A paper shear mechanism consists of a guillotine 8 having a fixed blade 19 and a pivoted blade 21 . The cutting edge 20 of the fixed blade is concavely curved so that paper 4 to be cut fed between the blades assumes a corresponding curvature and is given some longitudinal rigidity during the cutting operation. The pivoted blade is of composite structure to simplify the manufacturing process and thus reduce cost. Essentially, it includes a cutting section 37 stamped from flexible sheet steel shim to provide a cutting eage 40 with the desired nip angle. The flexible steel section is spot welded to a mild steel backing member 39 with an elongated spring member sandwiched between the two. The spring member has a number of spring teeth 41 which exert a force along the length of the flexible section to deflect its cutting edge laterally towards the fixed blade. By this means contact between the cutting edges 20 and 40 is maintained along the length of a cut and relief between the facing surfaces of the two blades is provided. A sheet feeding apparatus with a correspondingly curved cross section to the fixed blade feeds paper web 4 to the shear mechanism. A single motor 13 serves to feed paper during forward rotation and to operate the paper shear during reverse rotation.
