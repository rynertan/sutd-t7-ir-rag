# Heat pump systems for residential use.

## Abstract
An air conditioning system of the air cycle heat to pump type for selectively heating and cooling a resi dence or similar space environment. In one embodiment, a combustor and associated Brayton cycle turbine pro vide the primary drive to a compressor constituting the heat pump. in a second embodiment, the Brayton turbine is replaced by an electric motor coupled to drive the compressor shaft. An auxiliary turbine is also coupled to the drive shaft to provide auxiliary drive derived from the operation of a portion of the system at sub atmospheric pressure. In this portion, during the cooling 30 mode, water is evaporated into the system to further assist in cooling by removing the latent heat of vapo risation.
