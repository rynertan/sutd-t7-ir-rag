# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COOLING OR FREEZING

## Abstract
A video camera 56 is employed to monitor the loading with articles to be frozen of an endless belt which passes through a freezing apparatus so as to freeze such articles typically by contact with liquid nitrogen. The video camera 56 is associated with electronic circuits that generate a signal representative of the belt loading and compare it with a signal representative of an optimum belt loading. If the difference between the signals is greater than a chosen threshold the belt speed is adjusted so as to reduce or eliminate the difference. By this means an improvement is made possible in the efficiency with which the liquid nitrogen is utilised.
