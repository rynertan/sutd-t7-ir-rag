# CABLE DRIVE SYSTEMS FOR MOVING WALKWAYS

## Abstract
A cable drive system suitable for use with moving walkways wherein a plurality of serially connected platforms 10 travel in a circuitous path of travel that includes change of direction regions 18, 20 connected by constant speed zones is disclosed. The cable drive system of the invention is particularly suited for use with an accelerating and decelerating moving walkway wherein acceleration and deceleration zones are located at the beginning and end, respectively, of each constant speed zone. The cable drive system comprises a drive cable 60 positioned beneath the constant speed zones of the path of travel and releasable cable coupling mechanisms 98 associated with and con nected to the platforms 10 . An actuating mechanism 94, 96 and 122, 124 actuates the cable coupling mechanisms to grip the cable 60 at the beginning of the constant speed zones and release the cable at the end of the constant speed zones. In a preferred embodiment, the primary drive cable 60 described above is supplemented by an auxiliary cable drive mechanism that engages the platforms in the change of direction regions only. The latter, or low speed, cable drive mechanism includes a cable 62 that travels around the periphery of the change of direction regions 18, 20 , and concave grooves 142 formed in the platforms that friction ally engage the cable 62 in the change of direction regions.
