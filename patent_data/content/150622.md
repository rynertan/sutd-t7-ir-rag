# ELECTROMAGNETIC MONITORING OF ELONGATE CONDUCTORS, PARTICULARLY PIPES OR CABLES

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for electromagnetic monitoring of elongate conductors, particularly for assessing the con dition of pipes or cables that extend partly beneath the sea. An AC signal is applied 14, 16 to the conductor 10, and transducers 18, 20 at spaced regions receive induced sig nals which are compared 22 to provide an output indica tive of signal leakage from the conductor 10. An induced signal may also be compared 26 with a preset standard 30.
