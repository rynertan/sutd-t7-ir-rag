# Cystic fibrosis detection method and kit.

## Abstract
A method of diagnosing cystic fibrosis, identifying carriers for cystic fibrosis, and norrcarriers or normal persons. The detection is based on the discovery of the genetic abnormality or biochemical defect in cystic fibrosis, which occurs in mitochondria, minute bodies found in the cytoplasm of most cells which are the principal energy source of the cell and contain the cytochrome enzymes of terminal electron transport. The method comprises an as say carried out on preparations derived from human cells possessing mitochondria. The assay may be a kinetic assay of the enzyme complex of the energy conserving site of the mitochondrial electron transport system of the cells or an assay of mitochondrial activity governed by the en zyme complex. The assay is then evaluated by comparison with standards established as the result of similar assays of cells of other subjects of known condition. The kit com prises vials each containing an enzyme substrate, an elec tron acceptor and a buffer, the buffers differing within the vials in order to establish differing pH conditions.
