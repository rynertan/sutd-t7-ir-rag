The present invention relates to carbapenem antibiotics having a 2 aza substituent including azido, acylamino, amino, alkyl and dialkylamino, triazolyl, triazolinyl, aziridinyl, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide and anhydride derivatives. Carbapenem antibiotics are known in the art, principally due to the discovery of thienamycin, which exhibits a therapeutically exciting and attractive broad spectrum of antibiotic activity, being of the formula The N formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin, which is crystalline and a commercially more viable form of thienamycin, also exhibits a desirable broad spectrum of antibiotic activity and is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Patent 4,194,047, which also discloses a method for its synthesis from thienamycin. Despite the surprising and extraordinary broad spectrum antibiotic activity of thienamycin and its derivatives, there still exists a continuing need for new and more effective antibiotics. For unfortunately, there is not static effectiveness of any given antibiotic because continued wide scale usage selectively gives rise to resistant strains of pathogens. In addition, the known antibiotics suffer from the disadvantage of being effective only against certain types of microorganisms. Accordingly, the search for new antibiotics continues and this is particularly true in the carbapenem family of compounds. For example, U.S. Patent 4,424,230 to B. G. Christensen et al. which issued January 3, 1984 and is assigned to Merck Co. Inc. discloses 6 1 hydroxyethyl 3 substituted amino 1 azabicyclo 3.2.0 hept 2 en 7 one carboxylic acids of the following formula Further, U.S. Patent 4,217,453 to B. G.

In the foregoing word description of the above, schematic reaction diagram for the total synthesis of the defined antibiotics, it is to be understood that there is considerable latitude in selection of precise reaction parameters. Suggestion of this latitude and its breadth is generally indicated by the enumeration of equivalent solvent systems, temperature ranges, protecting groups, and range of identities of involved reagents. Further, it is to be understood that the presentation of the synthetic scheme as comprising distinct steps in a given sequence is more in the nature of a descriptive convenience than as a necessary requirement for one will recognize that the mechanically dissected scheme represents a unified scheme of synthesis and that certain steps, in actual practice, are capable of being merged, conducted simultaneously, or effected in a reverse sequence without materially altering the progress of synthesis. The following examples recite a precise scheme of total synthesis. It is to be understood that the purpose of this recitation is to further illustrate the total synthesis and not to impose any limitation. Temperature is in C.
