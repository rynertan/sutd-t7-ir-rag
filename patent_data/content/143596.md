## Description
This invention relates to a semiconductor memory device and, more particularly, to a programmable read only memory device wherein each memory cell comprises a transistor referred to as a floating gate transistor hereinafter having a floating gate and a control gate formed above the floating gate, and wherein data can be programmed into the floating gate transistor reliably even at a low programming voltage. Recently, the programming voltage for an EPROM erasable programmable read only memory having a floating gate transistor as a memory cell has been lowered. This is mainly because transistors in a peripheral circuit are micropatterned and have a low breakdown voltage to realise a high density memory device, and the programming voltage must be lowered in accordance with such a reduced breakdown voltage. However, when the programming voltage is lowered, the programming current is also reduced, in order to realise a high memory density memory device. As a result, data may not be properly programmed into a memory cell. For this reason, the peripheral circuit or the like must be improved to ensure that data are properly programmed into the corresponding memory cell. In a conventional memory device, data are programmed into a memory cell, i.e. a floating gate transistor, by applying high voltages to the control gate and the drain of the transistor. However, since the timing of the application of the high voltages is not particularly determined, the operation of programming the floating gate transistor is not properly performed, especially when the high voltage is applied to the drain after it is applied to the control gate, or after the control gate voltage becomes relatively high. US A 4282446 discloses a device designed to overcome problems associated with the resistance of elongated diffused regions used as column lines. A distributed capacitance associated with each cell is charged by the selection of the respective column. Subsequently when the row is selected the capacitance discharges to provide a transitory pulse of programming current for the cell. According to the present invention there is provided a programmable read only memory device comprising a memory cell transistor having a source, a drain, a floating gate, and a control gate formed above the floating gate, a column line for the memory cell transistor, and delay means for controlling and delaying the timing of the application of a high programming voltage to the control gate relative to that of the application of a high programming voltage to the drain of the memory cell transistor when a data programming operation is performed by applying the high programming voltages to the control gate and the drain of the memory cell transistor, the programming voltage applied to the gate of the memory cell transistor rising gradually, and the column line being arranged to provide a load connected to said drain such that the cell is maintained in a saturation state when a high programming voltage is applied to its control gate. Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a partial circuit diagram illustrating an equivalent circuit in a programming mode of a general EPROM device Figure 2 is a cross section of a floating gate transistor used in the device of Figure 1 Figures 3A and 3B are graphs depicting the operating states of the circuit of Figure 1 under different operating conditions Figures 4, 5 and 6 are circuit diagrams showing various circuit portions of a memory device of one embodiment of the present invention Figure 7 is a waveform diagram illustrating the operation of the memory device including the circuit portions of Figures 4, 5 and 6 and Figures 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are circuit diagrams showing various circuit portions of a memory device as another embodiment of the present invention. Before describing the preferred embodiments, an explanation will be given of the operation of programming a floating gate transistor used as a memory cell of an EPROM device. Figure 1 shows an equivalent circuit diagram of a conventional EPROM in the programming mode. Referring to Figure 1, the reference symbol Q₁ denotes a data programming transistor, Q₂ denotes a column selection transistor, and Q₃ denotes a memory cell transistor having a floating gate i.e. a floating gate transistor . These transistors are connected in series between a high voltage V Figure 2 illustrates a structure of the floating gate transistor Q₃ used in the circuit of Figure 1. The floating gate transistor Q₃ comprises an N In order to program data into the floating gate transistor Q₃ in the circuit of Fig. 1, the column selection signal CLM and the row selection signal RWS are set at the high voltage V That is, in the structure of Fig. 2, when the high voltage is applied to the drain region 2, the drain end of the channel region becomes pinched off due to the pinch off effect and a depletion region extends between the end of the channel region and the drain. Therefore, the intensity of the electric field of the depletion region becomes very large and carriers in the depletion region are greatly accelerated by the electric field so that hot electrons are generated. In this case, if a high voltage is applied to the control gate 6, the hot electrons are attracted toward and injected into the floating gate 4 by the electric field generated by the high voltage of the control gate 6. In the conventional EPROM, the application timings of the column selection signal CLM and the row selection signal RWS are not specifically controlled in the programming mode. In this case, no problem occurs when the programming voltage V As shown in Fig. 3A, when the row selection signal RWS increases prior to an increase in the column selection signal CLM and has reached the voltage V In applying the present invention, in order to eliminate the problem with the conventional memory device, a column selection signal goes to a high level prior to the rising of a row selection signal, thereby effectively programming data. As shown in Fig. 3B, the column selection signal is increased to V When electrons are gradually stored in the floating gate by avalanche injection after the programming operation is started, an electrical field acting from the control gate to the channel region of the memory cell transistor Q₃ decreases, thereby decreasing the conductance. Therefore, even if the ON resistance of the column selection transistor Q₂ is sufficiently high, the self conductance of the memory cell transistor Q₃ is gradually decreased, so that a high voltage substantially the same as the voltage V Figures 4, 5, and 6 show a semiconductor memory device using N channel MIS transistors according to an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 4 is a circuit diagram of a delay circuit for delaying a programming instruction signal, i.e., a program signal PGM. This delay circuit comprises inverter transistors Q₄ , Q₅ , ..., and Q₁₁ , and capacitors C₁ , C₂ , and C₃ connected to the output terminals of the respective inverters and power supply V Figure 5 shows a unit circuit of a row decoder provided to each row of the memory matrix not shown . This unit decoder circuit comprises a NOR gate G₁ for receiving a unique combination of noninverted address signals not shown and inverted address signals ADD, a high withstand voltage depletion type transistor Q₁₂, a high withstand voltage deep depletion type transistor Q₁₄ , and a high withstand voltage non dosed type transistor Q₁₃. The transistor Q₁₄ comprises a transistor having a lower threshold voltage than the conventional depletion transistor. The transistor Q₁₃ has a threshold voltage of 0 V. In the circuit shown in Fig. 5, an output from the gate G₁ goes to a high level when the associated row is to be selected. A row selection signal having the level V Figure 6 shows the arrangement of a unit column decoder circuit. The unit column decoder circuit comprises a gate G₂ for receiving unique combination of noninverted address signals not shown and inverted address signals ADD, a high withstand voltage depletion type transistor Q₁₅ , a high withstand voltage non dosed type transistor Q₁₆ , and a high withstand voltage deep depletion transistor Q₁₇. The transistors Q₁₇ and Q₁₇ are the same as the transistors Q₁₃ and Q₁₄ of the decoder shown in Fig. 5, respectively. Unlike the decoder circuit in Fig. 5, the gate of the transistor Q₁₆ in the decoder circuit shown in Fig. 6 directly receives the program signal PGM. The operation of the decoder circuit in Fig. 6 is basically the same as that of Fig. 5, in that, when the associated column is to be selected, the output from the gate G₂ goes high, and the program signal PGM is set at the high voltage V In the above description, the program signal PGM is directly applied to the transistor Q₁₆ of the column decoder, and the program signal DPGM delayed by the delay circuit in Fig. 4 is supplied to the gate of the transistor Q₁₃ in the row decoder. Therefore, the leading edge of the row selection signal is delayed from that of the column selection signal. As shown in Fig. 7, the row and column selection signals simultaneously rise to the power supply voltage V A semiconductor memory device using a CMIS circuit will be described in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Figure 8 shows a delay circuit using a CMIS circuit. This delay circuit corresponds to that shown in Fig. 4. In the circuit shown in Fig. 8, the program signal PGMC is inverted by a CMIS inverter 1 consisting of a P channel MOS transistor Q₁₈ and an N channel MIS transistor Q₁₉. The inverted program signal is supplied to a parallel circuit of an N channel MIS transistor Q₂₀ and a P channel MIS transistor Q₂₁. The parallel circuit of the transistors Q₂₀ and Q₂₁ serves as a resistor, and this parallel circuit and capacitors C₄ and C₅ constitute an integrator. The inverted program signal is delayed by the integrator and is inverted again by a CMIS inverter 2 consisting of a P channel MIS transistor Q₂₂ and an N channel MIS transistor Q₂₃, thereby obtaining a delayed program signal PGMR. Figure 9 shows a power switching circuit for generating an internal power supply voltage V When the program signal PGMC is set at a high level, the circuit shown in Fig. 9 is set in the programming mode. In this case an output from the CMIS inverter 3 goes to a low level, and an output from the CMIS inverter 4 goes to a high level. The transistor Q₃₁ is thus turned on. Since an output from the CMIS inverter 5 is set at a low level, the transistor Q₃₂ is turned off. Therefore, the high voltage V On the other hand, when the program signal PGMC is set at a low level, an output from the CMIS inverter 3 goes to a high level, and an output from the CMIS inverter 4 goes to a low level, so that the transistor Q₃₁ is cut off. Then an output from the CMIS inverter 5 goes to a high level, and the transistor Q₃₂ is turned on. The power supply voltage V Figure 10 shows a power supply switching circuit for generating an internal power supply voltage V Figure 11 shows a unit row decoder circuit provided to each row of the memory matrix. This unit row decoder circuit comprises an OR gate G₃ , a high withstand voltage N channel MIS transistor Q₄₆ , a high with stand voltage P channel MIS transistor Q₄₇ , and a CMIS inverter 9 consisting of a high withstand voltage P channel MIS transistor Q₄₈ and a high withstand voltage N channel MIS transistor Q₄₉. When the associated row is selected, an output from the gate G₃ in the unit row decoder circuit in Fig. 11 goes to a low level, and an output i.e., the row selection signal RWS from the CMIS inverter 9 goes to a high level. In this case, when the memory device is set in the programming mode, the internal power supply voltage V When the row is not selected, an output from the gate G₃ goes to a high level, and the row selection signal RWS goes to a low level. In this case, the transistor Q₄₇ is turned on and the input terminal of the CMIS inverter 9 rises. Therefore, the row selection signal RWS is completely clamped to a low level. Figure 12 shows the arrangement of a unit column decoder circuit. This unit column decoder circuit has the same arrangement as the row decoder circuit of Fig. 11, except that the power supply voltage V According to the present invention, since the high voltage applied to the control gate of the floating gate transistor is delayed from the high voltage applied to the drain, data can be properly programmed even if the programming voltage is low, the sizes of the peripheral transistors can be decreased, and hence a highly integrated memory can be obtained.
