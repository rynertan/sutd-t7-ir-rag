# Fluid particle separator unit.

## Abstract
A fluid particle separator unit 8 comprises a cylindrical chamber 9 having an inlet end 19 substantially closed by an apertured rotor 18 and an outlet 5 , opposite the inlet, surrounded by a baffle wall 12 extending coaxially within the chamber. The rotor has vanes 25 projecting into the chamber at an acute angle Î² to the circumferential direction of motion in use and the chamber wall 10 has elongate bleed slits 17 . In use in a particle containing fluid flow, the rotor is rotated so as to oppose the flow through the inlet and separates particles from the fluid, cleansed fluid leaving the chamber through the outlet. In a suction cleaner, the unit is mounted in the cleaner container so as to separate dust particles from air drawn through the cleaner, the dust collecting in the container the rotor may be driven by a drive shaft 20 coupled to the shaft of the impeller motor assembly which causes the air flow through the cleaner.
