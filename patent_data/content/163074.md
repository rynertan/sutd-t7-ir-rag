## Description
The present invention relates to a process for forming via holes having sloping sidewalls in a polymer film. In most lithographic etching processes it is desired to have vertical walls resulting. An exception to this is in the case of via holes, where it is now recognized that it is advantageous to have sloping sidewalls. The article by Bondur and Clark in Solid State Technology, page 122, April 1980, describes a process for obtaining via holes with sloping sidewalls in SiO₂ layers EP A 0 010 657 discloses oxygen plasma etching of via holes in a polymer film using a deposited and patterned silicon film as a mask. The invention seeks to provide a process for forming via holes having sloping sidewalls in a polymer film, which is more convenient than conventional processes involving wet development with alkaline solutions. A process for forming via holes having sloping sidewalls in a polymer film comprises, according to the invention, the successive steps of coating a substrate with a polymer film, positioning a perforated mask at a distance of from 20 to 200 micrometers above the polymer film, the mask being formed of a material which is impervious to oxygen reactive ion etching and exposing the polymer film to oxygen reactive ion etching through the mask until holes are etched through the polymer film in registration with the perforations in the mask. Any suitable organic polymer may be used to form the film used in the present process. Many such materials are known, for example, those used as resist materials. Particularly good results have been obtained when the organic film is a polyimide. The mask may be of any material impervious to oxygen reactive ion etching. One such preferred material is silicon, particularly silicon 100 such as is found in stencil masks. The mask thickness is not critical, but good results have been obtained with masks of from about 2 to 5 micrometers in thickness. Control of the gap between the polymer film and the mask is a critical feature of the present invention. As this gap is increased, the slope of the wall becomes greater. Conversely, as it is decreased, the slope becomes less. As is shown in the control experiment below, when there is no gap at all, that is, when the mask is in contact with the polymer film, sloping sidewalls are not obtained at all. Under these circumstances the sidewalls are vertical. The most preferred distance between the mask and the polymer film is from 50 to 100 micrometers. The following experiments demonstrate the process for carrying out the present invention. In the first experiment, the mask is in contact with the polymer film, i.e., the gap is zero and under these circumstances a vertical sidewall results. Examples 1, 2 and 3 below show the operation of the present invention to obtain the desired sloping sidewalls. The experiments were all conducted using silicon 100 stencil masks.
