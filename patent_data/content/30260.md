# Information transducing apparatus.

## Abstract
Cheques 3 are transported by a belt 16 around a drum 14. Below the drum a transducer 11 reads information from the cheques which are pressed against cylindrical bearing surface portions 35 and 36 on either side of the transducer by a belt 24. The belt 24 is entrained around idlers 25 and 26 on either side of the transducer, tensioned by a spring biased roller 28 and driven by a capstan portion 27 of a roller 22 having a small diameter portion 33 engaged by the belt 16.
