# A method of processing work, e.g. in the manufacture of dispensing containers, and apparatus for making such containers.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for processing workpieces comprises continuously transferring the workpieces to and fro among a plurality of rotating members 9,10 , each rotating member 9,10 carrying a plurality of sets of work stations A,C B,D . In the manufacture of dispensing contain ers, workpieces comprising precut tubular sleeves X are placed by a feeder 19 onto mandrels of a set of work stations A on a continuously rotating turret 10 , certain operations are performed thereon and they are then transfer red by a rotary transfer device 18 to a set of work stations B of a second continuously rotating turret 15 . On this turret 15 , the sleeves X are married with headpieces Y and the resulting assemblies X Y are returned by another transfer device 17 to a set of work stations C on the first turret 10 . As the first turret 10 rotates, the assemblies are heat bonded into dispensing containers XY which, after transfer back to the second turret 15 , are finally discharged by a rotary unloader 22 as finished containers.
