# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO FEED DEVICES

## Abstract
A feed device 1 for solid fuel domestic appliances comprises a hopper 2 with downwardly inclined sides 3 defining a discharge slot 4 beneath which is located a flat plate 6 in spaced relation thereto. The plate 6 is mounted on a central pivot 7 and is movable thereabout by a suitable low power low speed drive 5 . A spreader device comprising two series of inclined spaced apart metal strips 8 is located below the plate 6 . Fuel held within the hopper 2 flows out onto the plate 6 and assumes a natural angle of repose when the plate 6 is horizontal. Upon small angular move ment of the plate 6 , fuel is caused to flow off the plate 6 which in use is disposed evenly over a fire bed by the spreader device.
