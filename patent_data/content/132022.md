# AC UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system to provide substantially uninterruptible AC power. Line voltage is applied to a load through a solid state electronic switch. A squarewave inverter powered by batter ies is connected across the load. When line power is reduced to a predetermined level, the switch opens disconnecting the line, and after a short time delay of less than a millisecond, the inverter starts. Upon restoration of normal line power, the process is reversed the inverter stops and after a like short time delay, the switch closes reconnecting the line.
