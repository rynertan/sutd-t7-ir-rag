# Apparatus and method for remote sensing of gases, vapours or aerosols.

## Abstract
A remote sensor for detecting gas, vapour or aerosol com prising means to measure the change in temporal coherence of light of a selected narrow waveband when it interacts with the gas etc. The light can be provided by a laser source or spectrally filtered sunlight etc. Received radiation 41 is split in to two, beams by a Fresnel biprism 44 and then detected by a detector 46 sensitised by a modulating reticle 47 to inter ference fringes. A glass delay plate 45 of suitable thickness is placed in the path of one of the beams such that only received radiation having a temporal coherence greater than a minimum determined by the plate thickness produces an output signal from detector 46. The minimum temporal coherence is set higher than the temporal coherence of the illuminating ra diation. In alternative arrangements a band pass temporal coherence filter may be used and the sensor can be made to spectrally scan the field of view by using a tunable laser or a variable centre frequency band pass optical filter.
