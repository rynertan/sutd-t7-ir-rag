## Description
This invention relates to a novel cyclohexane derivative and a liquid crystal composition containing the same. Liquid crystal display elements utilize the optical anisotropy and the dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal substances, and there are various modes such as those of T N twisted nematic type, DS dynamic scattering type, guest host type. DAP type, etc., depending on their display mode. There vary properties required for liquid crystal substances used according to these modes, but it has been required in common that the substances exhibit liquid crystal phases within a temperature range as broad as possible and also they are stable to moisture, heat, light, air, etc. At present, however, there is no single compound which satisfies all such requirements hence liquid crystal compositions obtained by blending several kinds of liquid crystal compounds or blending these with compounds similar to liquid crystals have been used. As examples of compounds having a 3,4 dihalogenophenyl group or a 3 halogeno 4 cyanophenyl group, Japanese patent application laid open Nos. Sho 58 83665 1983, Sho 58 210057 1983, Sho 59 170042 1984, Sho 59 193850 1984, Sho 59 80651 1984 and Sho 60 45549 1985 disclose respectively ester compounds expressed by the following formulas 1 6 In the above formulas, R represents a linear chain alkyl group. The compounds of the above formulas are liquid crystal compounds or compounds similar thereto, capable of being used as liquid crystal compositions by blending them with other liquid crystal compounds. The respective compounds of the above formulas, however, have drawbacks as described below. The compounds of the formulas 1 , 2 and 3 constitute a liquid crystal blend having a relatively large dielectric anisotropy value Δε , but the blend has a high viscosity, and further among these compounds, those which exhibit liquid crystal phases are scanty. Compounds expressed by the formulas 4 , 5 and 6 have a relatively large dielectric anisotropy value and a suitable mesomorphic range, but they have a high viscosity. Further, since the compounds 1 6 have an ester bond, they are liable to be hydrolyzed thus liquid crystal compositions using these compounds could not have completely solved problems of stability, reliability, etc. A first object of the present invention is to provide a compound which has a good stability, a low viscosity and a large dielectric anisotropy value, and also when it is used in admixture with other components to constitute a liquid crystal composition, has a good compatibility therewith and does not raise both the viscosity and the driving voltage of the liquid crystal composition together. A second object of the present invention is to provide a liquid crystal composition having a low viscosity and a low operating threshold voltage. The present invention in a first aspect resides in a cyclohexane derivative expressed by the formula The present invention in a second aspect resides in a liquid crystal composition having at least two components at least one of which is a cyclohexane derivative expressed by the formula I as set forth in the above first aspect of the present invention. The cyclohexane derivative of the present invention expressed by the formula I includes compounds expressed by the following formulas a h , as those which are preferred as a component of liquid crystal display materials, and in these formulas, R is as defined above and particularly preferred to be a linear alkyl group of 2 to 7 carbon atoms Among the compound of the present invention, those of the formula I wherein ℓ 1 and m 0 have a low viscosity and when used as a component of a liquid crystal composition, have a function of enhancing the dielectric anisotropy of the resulting liquid crystal composition. In particular, the compounds expressed by the formulas a and b have an extremely low viscosity and a notable effectiveness upon its dielectric anisotropy. By using such compounds having two 6 membered rings as a component of a liquid crystal material, it is possible to operate liquid crystal display elements at a low driving voltage. Among the compound of the present invention, compounds having three of four 6 membered rings have a broad mesomorphic range, and by adding these compounds as a component of a liquid crystal composition, it is possible to broaden the mesomorphic range of the resulting liquid crystal blend without raising the viscosity of the blend.
