# Brake actuation assembly.

## Abstract
A brake actuation assembly comprises of a master cylinder and a power assist apparatus in axially aligned relationship, the primary piston 68 of the master cylinder 12 being connected to the movable wall 125 of the power assist apparatus 16 through a linkage member 66 In order to reduce the lost pedal motion upon braking, the invention provides for an adjustment mechanism 82 for ad justing the rest position of the primary piston 68 with respect to the associated compensator port 44 by which the pressure chamber 62 communicates with a fluid reservoir 46 For use in braking systems for automotive vehicles.
