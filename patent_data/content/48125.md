# Apparatus for detecting the position of the end of the outer turn of a coil of strip material.

## Abstract
When it is necessary to detect the position of the end 3 of the outer turn of a coil of strip material 1 , the coil is rotatably supported with its axis substantially horizontal and apparatus for detecting the end 5 comprises a detector assembly 17 including a proximity switch and a projection 20 extending beyond the switch and support means for the assembly such that the proximity switch is spaced from the outer surface of the coil and with the projection nearer to the coil than is the switch and the projection is upstream of the switch with reference to the non paying out direction of rotation of the coil. When the end of the turn passes from beneath the projection, the switch is actuated.
