# Digital signal processor.

## Abstract
A multichannel digital signal correlator or structurator re ceives pulses e.g. from a photo multiplier 1 and passes them through a standardiser into channels 1 to M. Each channel comprises a counter 5m, m 1 to M and shift register 6 Clock pulses are applied to each counter 9 and shift register 6 The correlator thus correlates two signals with increasing sample times T The multipliers 7
