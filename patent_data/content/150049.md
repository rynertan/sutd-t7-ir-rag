# Nitrogen containing amorphous alloy.

## Abstract
Nitrogen containing amorphous alloys having a com bination of superior properties which are highly valuable and desirable for ferromagnetic materials or superconducting materials are produced by sputtering metallic materials and nitrogen compounds containing semi metal or semiconduct ing metal, such as boron or silicon, without requiring the use of nitrogen gas. The produced alloy has a novel structure, represented by the formula MxLyNz wherein M is at least one metal or alloy L is at least one semimetal or semiconducting element and x, y and z are fractional atomic percentages totaling 100 i.e., x y z 100 and the value of y z being 10 or more and the respective values of x, y, z being not zero .
