## Description
INEXTENSIBLE SHAPED RING FOR REINFORCING INSERTS OF SUFERELASTIC SOLID TIRE BEADS The present invention relates generally to reinforcing inserts for superelastic solid tire beads or the like and particularly to a shaped ring forming the above mentioned rein fQr cL g insert and capable of imparting to the superelastic solid tire bead or the like a very good dimensional stability. It is known that the superelastic or elastic solid tires have a characteristic structure formed of an inner layer or bead reinforced or not by inserts and intended to be mounted on the vehicle rim, an intermediate layer of elastic rubber and an outer layer forming the tire tread. The latter layer is formed of hard rubber, exhibiting high chemical and physical characteristics, particularly as far as the wear and abrasion resistance is concerned, whereas the intermediate layer is formed of a soft rubber exhibiting a high elastic hysteresis and the inner layer is formed of hard rubber since it must exhibit high mechanical characteristics as to the stiffness and the strength, being intended to form the tire bead which is to he housed in a seat provided in the vehicle rim.Furthermore, the solid tire bead is designed in such a way that a replacement of the conventional tires with the above mentioned solid tires can occur, without the necessity of changing the tire rim, thereby permitting both the tires to be interchanged. These solid tires offer Great advantages with respect to the conventional tires, particularly when employed in industrial vehicles for internal uses, such as load elevators and carriers even subjected to very high weights. In fact, they have a very high safety against damaging, as well as a long life even under unfavourable conditions of use. Further they have a high wear resistance, a tough tread and great strength in adverse conditions of use. To this it is to add the same running comfort as the conventional tires, an easy assemblability on the rims with a rather favourable mechanical fit thereon. However, besides these advantages, this kind of tire presents some drawbacks. One of more relevant ones is given by the fact that, when the solid tire is mounted on and mechanically anchored to the rim, a small backlash between rim and tire bead after some time occurs which is due to the settling of the tire bead within the rim seat by permanent deformations thereof caused by the static, dynamic and shear stresses being exerted on the wheel tire, which backlash can ultimately lead to a slip between solid tire and rim with the result that, i.a. a failing stop of the vehicle upon braking may occur. This drawback occurs even with solid tires provided with reinforcing inserts, e.g round irons, metal strands or straps, since these insert are not capable to prevent the localized compressions that the rim imparts to the solid tire, particularly the tire bead, or at the regions between a pair of inserts. Another drawback presented by the superelastic or elastic solid tires provided with a reinforcing insert on the tire bead, which reinforcing insert, as already said, is generally in the form of round irons, metal strands and straps or else in another suitable material, is that the tire bead, due to the above static, dynamic and shear stresses and the material compressions between the rim and the bead side, can both radially and peripherically split or crack with resulting rupture of the tire which then must be changed. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to obviate the above mentioned and other drawbacks by providing a reinforcing ring for superelastic or elastic solid tire beads which increases the stability thereof in the rim alld prevents the adverse compression concentration in the tire region due to the dynamic and shear loads. It is another object of the present invention to provide a reinforcing ring for superelastic or elastic solid tire beads which avoids the deformations occurring between tire and rim, particularly on the tire bead sides. These and othefobjects of the present invention are attained by an inextensible shaped ring for reinforcing inserts of superelastic solid tire beads or the like, which is characterized in that said ring is formed of at least one circular element provided on each of its outer edges with an annular band having an outwardly arcuated shape, mating the rim shape on the sides in order to anchor thereto by means of the superelastic or elastic solid tire to avoid a possible slip between tire and rim during the use. According to a feature of the present invention, said ring is formed of a pair of circular elements, each of which is provided on its outer edge with an annular band reinforcing the tire bead sides, both said circular elements being firmly secured to each other by means of cross spacers. Preferably, said inextensible reinforcing ring is provided with openings located along the center line thereof in order to relieve the stresses imposed on the tire during the use in the center portion of the tire bead. Suitably, the bending radius of said annular bands of the reinforcing ring is concentric with that of the rim edges in such a way as to filow the shape thereof in order to prevent rubber constrictions between rim and solid tire due to the increase of the bearing surface on the rim. Advantageously, said openings provided in the circular element s forming the reinforcing ring act as interruptions of the thermal bridges occurring otherwise therein by the tire heating due to environmental and operative conditions. These and other features of the present invention will be more apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, description and drawings being given by way of example only and therefore not intended in a limiting sense of the scope of the invention. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view of an embodiment of the tire bead reinforcing ring inserted in a superelastic solid tire shown in dashed lines Fig.2 is a view similar to Fig.l, showing another embodiment of the tire bead reinforcing ring, and Fig.3 is a partial cross sectional view of the superelastic solid tire with the reinforcing ring embodied therein, the tire being mounted on a conventional V shaped rim. Referring now to the drawings and particularly to Fig.3, there is shown a superelastic solid tire A, especially adapted to be mounted on industrial trucks, such as lifting trucks or the like, which presents a well known characteristic structure, formed of an inner layer or bead B, motlnted on the rim C which advantageously is a conventional rim for inflating tires, comprised of two portions 10 12, which can be secured to each other by means of fastening means 1 4, such as bolts , an intermediate layer n in a very elastic rubber so as to form a cushion and an outer layer E forming the tread of the solid tire A. F designates the reinforcing inextensible metal ring extending along all the circular development of the tire beadB so that the latter is suitably stiffened in the direction of the axis of the wheel mounting the solid tire A in order to resist to axial compression stresses which are exerted on the solid tire A when it is mounted on the rim C. As said, the outer layer E acting as a tread is formed of hard rubber having high physical and chemical characteristics, particularly as to the wear and abrasion resistance the intermediate layer n is formed at least. partially of soft rubber and of thereforeoa high elastic hysteresis and the inner layer ss is formed of hard rubber since it must have high mechanical characteristics as to stiffness and mechanical strength, because it is designed to form the bead of the solid tire A. As already said, the superelastic solid tire A embodies the metal reinforcing ring F which, in accordance with Fig.l, is formed of a pÅair of circular elements 16 and 18 firmly secured to each other by means of two or more spacers 20 in the form of a cross plate or else a round iron or other means suitable for this purpose. These circular elements 16 and 18 are provided on their circular outer edges with an annular band 22 and 24 having an outwardly arcuated shape. The bending radius r of this band is preferably concentric with the radius R of the rim C edges enclosing therebewteen the bead B of the solid tire A so as to closely follow its shape in order to have a uniform distribution of the stresses acting on the bead sides and therefore the compression of the bead portions enclosed between the rimC edges and the arcuated annular bands 22 and 24. As it can be seen from Fig.1, the reinforcing ring F has a greater diameter than that of the rim in order to increase the bearing surface thereon and it is provided with four plates 20 connecting the circular elements 16, 18, thereby forming four rectangular openings 2S which are intended to receive the bead rubber, since the ring F is applied to the solid tireA in a single curing operation , these openings 26 then acting as relief means towards the ring center of the stresses imposed to the solid tire during use. In Fig.2 there is shown the reinforcing ring F in another embodiment. In fact, instead of being formed of a pair of circular elements 16 and 18, it is formed hier of one circular element 28 only having on its outer edges the arcuated annular bands 30 and 32, as in the embodiment according to Fig.l. The stress relief means are formed in this case of circular openings 14 provided along the center line of the circular element in this example there are four openings and intended to receive the rubber of the bead B during the application of the reinforcing ring F to the solid tire A in a single curing operation. Therefore, the superelastic solid tire A together with the metal reinforcing ring F permits, in its preferred embodiments, the above mentioned main advantages to be obtained with respect to similar known tires, i.e. increased stability of the tire within the rim with resulting prevention of unduly resctrictions due to dynamic and shear loads, improvement of load resistence in the inner portion of the superelastic solid tire both as to the attachment between rim and solid tire and as to the greater load supporting action, since the reinforcing ring has a greater diameter than that of the rim, and elimination of the effects which can cause the solid tire to slip on the wheel rim. As a further advantage it is to be said that the openings provided in the circular element or between the pair of circular elements forming the reinforcing ring F act as an interruption of the thermal bridges which would occur therein by the heating of the rubber forming the solid tire A during its use in the above mentioned vehicles, both for the environment working conditions and for the heavy duty, which these solid tires are generally designed to, since this heat would be dissipated within the wheel rir which contacts the robber forming the tiro bead rather than within the reinforcing ring. It should be understood that various changes and modification can be made to the embodiments herein described without departxng from the scope of the present invention.
