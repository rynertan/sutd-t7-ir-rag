# Semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes p and n type semicon ductor layers 2, 4 formed on an insulating substrate 6 and gate electrodes 18 1, 18 2, 20 1, 20 2 selectively and insula tively formed over the respective p and n type semiconduc tor layers 2, 4 and forming D type MOS transistors. In this semiconductor device, the p and n type semiconductor layers 2, 4 are made in contact with each other, and negative and positive power supply terminals V
