# Memory subsystem.

## Abstract
A memory system 10 including two memories 30 and 40 addressed in parallel from latch 20 and bus 21 and a circuit 50 for selecting selection made by multiplexer 60 between the memories to determine whose output will be transmitted by output buffer 70 to, for example, processing circuitry. Normally, the output of one of the memories 30 is transmitted. The selection circuit includes a content ad dressable memory having a plurality of registers for storing addresses. The addresses which control the memories is also received by the selection circuitry. If a received address matches an address received by the selection circuitry, the selection circuit transmits a signal 51, which controls signal on line 64 which enables the output of the other memory to be transmitted to the processing circuitry.
