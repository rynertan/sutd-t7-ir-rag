The preparation of N oxides, such as Ia n 1 and Ib n 1 , from the corresponding pyridines, such as Ia n 0 and Ib n 0 can be carried out by any of several known methods as described in The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one or more of the methods described below in Equations 1, 2, 3 and 4. Reagents and reaction conditions are given for illustration only. As shown in Equation 1, compounds of Formula I, where J is other than J₉ and J₁₀, can be prepared by reacting a sulfonylisocyanate W 0 or a sulfonylisothiocyanate W S of Formula II with an appropriate heterocyclic amine of Formula III, wherein R and A are as previously defined. The reaction is carried out at 25 to 100 C in an inert, aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride or xylene for 0.5 to 24 hours as taught in U.S. Patent 4,127,405. Compounds of Formula I, where W is S and R is H, Id can be prepared by reacting the appropriate sulfonamide of Formula IV with a heterocyclic isothiocyanate of Formula V, as shown in Equation 2. The reaction is carried out at 25 to 80 C in an inert, aprotic solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate for 0.5 to 24 hours. The required heterocyclic isothiocyanates V are prepared from the corresponding amines III as taught in EPO Publication No. 35,893. Compounds of Formula I, where W is O Ie and J is other than J₁, J₂, J₅, J₆, J₁₇, J₁₈, J₂₆, J₂₇, J₂₈, and J₂₉ can be prepared by reacting the sulfonamides of Formula IV with an appropriate methylcarbamate of Formula VI in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylaluminum, as shown in Equation 3. The reaction is carried out at 25 to 40 in a solvent such as methylene chloride for 10 to 96 hours under an inert atmosphere as taught in EPO Publication No. 84,244 7 27 83 . The required carbamates VI are prepared by reacting the corresponding amines III with dimethylcarbonate or methyl chloroformate in the presence of a strong base. Alternatively, compounds of Formula Ie can be prepared by reacting a sulfonylcarbamate of Formula VII with an appropriate amine of Formula III, as shown in Equation 4. The reaction is carried out at 50 to 100 C in a solvent such as dioxane for 0.5 to 24 hours as taught in U.S. Patent 4,443,243. The required carbamates VII are prepared by reacting the corresponding sulfonamides IV with diphenylcarbonate in the presence of a strong base. The intermediate sulfonylisocyanates W O and sulfonylisothiocyanates W S of Formula II from Equation 1 can be prepared as shown in Equations 5, 6 and 7. As shown in Equation 5, sulfonylisocyanates of Formula IIa, where J is other than J₉ and J₁₀, can be prepared by the reaction of sulfonamides of Formula IV with phosgene in the presence of The sulfonylisocyanates can also be prepared from the sulfonamides by a two step procedure involving a reacting the sulfonamides with Alternatively, as shown in Equation 6, the sulfonylisocyanates of Formula IIa can be prepared by reacting the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides VIII with cyanic acid salts. The reaction is carried out at 25 to 100 C in an inert aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile for 0.5 to 24 hours in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide and an alkali metal salt such as lithium iodide according to the teachings of Japanese Patent No. 76 26,816 The sulfonylisothiocyanates of Formula IIb, where J is other than J₉ and J₁₀, can be prepared as shown in Equation 7, by contacting the sulfonamides of Formula IV with carbon disulfide in the presence of two equivalents of a strong base. The resulting salt is then reacted with phosgene according to the teachings of K. Hartke, The sulfonamides of Formula IV of Equations 2, 3, 5 and 7 are important intermediates for the preparation of the compounds of this invention. The syntheses of the required sulfonamide intermediates are described in Equations 8, 9 and 10. As shown in Equation 8, sulfonamides of Formula IV can be prepared from the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII by treatment with either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia. The preparation of sulfonamides from sulfonyl chlorides is widely reported in the literature for reviews see F. Hawking and J. S. Lawrence, The Sulfonamides, H. K. Lewis and Co., London, 1950 and E. H. Northey, The Sulfonamides and Allied Compounds, Reinhold Publishing Corp. New York, 1948. The sulfonamides of Formula IV can also be prepared from the corresponding thiol IX by the three step sequence shown in Equation 9. The first step involves chlorination of a mercaptan such as IX to give a sulfenyl chloride, the chlorine of which is subsequently displaced in a second step with a suitable ammonia equivalent such as aqueous ammonium hydroxide to provide a sulfenamide. In a final step, the intermediate sulfenamide can be oxidized to a sulfonamide, such as IV, using an oxidizing agent such as potassium permanganate according to the methods taught by R. Lejeune, The unsaturated sulfonamides of Formula IVa can also be prepared from the corresponding saturated sulfonamides of Formula IVb by the two step procedure shown in Equation 10, wherein G is SO₂NR₆ , CO₂ , Q₂ or Q₃ , R₂₄ is R₅ or R₇, and R₂₅ is H or where The first step involves benzylic bromination with N bromosuccinimide to give a monobromide, which is subsequently dehydrobrominated in a second step by reaction with a suitable base such as triethylamine or potassium t butoxide in an inert solvent such as THF. This method has been used to prepare isocoumarins from 3,4 dihydroisocoumarins see R. Barry, The sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII of Equations 6 and 8 can be prepared from the corresponding amines X by the method shown in Equation 11. The reaction involves diazotization of the amine X with sodium nitrite in HCl, followed by reaction of the diazonium salt with sulfur dioxide and cupric chloride in acetic acid in analogy to the teachings of Yale and Sowinski, Alternatively, sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII can be prepared by a modification of the above procedure whereby the diazotization reaction is carried out in dilute sulfuric acid and the resulting diazonium salt is reacted with sulfur dioxide, HCl and cupric chloride in a cosolvent mixture consisting of acetic acid water 1 1 and an immiscible, inert solvent such as 1 chlorobutane or methylene chloride at 0 40 C for 1 to 24 hours. Some of the sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII may be prepared by direct chlorosulfonation, depending on the substitution pattern on the ring and the nature of the substituent as will be known to one skilled in the art. The sulfonyl chlorides of Formula VIII can also be prepared from the chloro compounds XI by the two step sequence shown in Equation 12. The first step involves nucleophilic displacement of the chlorine atom with an alkyl or benzyl mercaptan or with thiourea to give an intermediate sulfide or thiouronium salt. The reaction can be carried out at 25 to 80 C in a polar solvent such as DMF for 0.5 to 24 hours. The sulfide, thiol or thiouronium salt is then oxidatively chlorinated to the desired sulfonyl chloride VIII in the presence of water at 30 to 0 in an aliphatic carboxylic acid solvent such as propionic acid or a concentrated acid such as hydrochloric acid or an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane for 1 to 24 hours. The preparation of pyridine sulfonyl chlorides, such as VIII, from mercaptans is similar to that taught by Y. Morisawa, et al., Many of the mercaptans of Formula IX in Equation 9 can be prepared from the pyridones of Formula XII as shown in Equation 13. where The thiones of Formula XIII can be prepared from the corresponding pyridones XII using base solubilized phosphorous pentasulfide in solvents such as acetonitrile, pyridine, or dichloromethane as taught by B. Dash, et al., Many other mercaptans can be prepared via the Newman Karnes rearrangement of O aryl thiocarbamates and hydrolysis of the resulting S aryl thiocarbamates, such as XV, a representative example of which is shown in Equation 14. The S aryl thiocarbamates, such as XV, can also be converted directly to sulfonyl chlorides VIII via oxidative chlorination as described in Equation 12b. The synthesis of lactone XIV is described by W. Korytnyk and H. Ahrens, Chlorides of Formula XI in Equation 12 can be obtained from pyridones XII as shown below. The pyridones XII can be converted to chlorides XI in the presence of phosphorous oxychloride and phosphorous pentachloride. This procedure has been used to prepare 4 chloro 1,3 dihydro 6 methyl 3 oxofuro 3,4 c pyridine see W. F. Bruce and H. W. Coover, Many other chlorides XIa can be prepared by direct chlorination of the corresponding pyridines XVI as shown in Equation 16. where The pyridines of Formula XVI are chlorinated with an appropriate chlorine source, such as sulfuryl chloride or chlorine in an aliphatic carboxylic acid solvent such as acetic acid or in an inert organic solvent such as dichloromethane for 1 to 24 hours to provide chlorides such as XIa. The preparation of annelated pyridines such as XI, IX and X can also be carried out by any of several methods described in Many pyridones of Formula XIIb can be prepared by the condensation of a 1,3 dicarbonyl compound such as XVII and 2 cyanoacetamide as shown in Equation 17. The substituted 1,3 dicarbonyl compounds, prepared by methods known to one skilled in the art, are combined with 2 cyanoacetamide in a solvent such as ethanol with an appropriate base catalyst to produce pyridones such as XIIa. Acid hydrolysis and cyclization gives the desired lactone pyridone XIIb. This method is taught by S. A. Harris, et al., Several pyridones of Formula XIIc or chlorides of Formula XIb can be obtained from pyridines such as XVIII as shown in Equation 18. where T₃ T₄ is N CH or CH N where T₃ T₄ is CH N where T₃ T₄ is N CH An appropriately substituted diisopropylamide XVIII is combined with two equivalents of lithium diisopropylamide to give an anion according to the teachings of J. Epsztajn, Acid hydrolysis of the 2 chloro isomer XIXa provides pyridones such as XIIc. Acid hydrolysis of the 3 chloropyridines XIXb provides chlorides such as XIb. Several other pyridones such as XIId and XIIe are more easily prepared by forming the pyridone on an existing heterocycle, examples of which are shown in Equations 19a and 19b. where Isocyanates such as XXIIa are formed where Metallation of amides XXIIb, prepared from the corresponding acid XXIb by methods known to one skilled in the art, with 2.0 equivalents of Pyridones of Formula XIIf can be prepared following the procedures of E. Bisagni, et al., The amines of Formula X, in Equation 11, can be prepared by reduction of the corresponding nitro compounds of Formula XXIII, as shown in Equation 20. The reduction of nitro compounds, prepared by methods known to one skilled in the art, to amines can be carried out by any of several methods as described in Nitro compounds of Formula XXIIIa can be prepared by nitration of the corresponding pyridones XXIV as shown below. where E and R₃ are as previously defined. The nitration is carried out in strong acid, such as acetic acid, according to the method taught by Eloy and Deryckere, Additional methods to prepare heterocyclic nitro compounds similar to XXIII are described in European Publication No. 107,979. The synthesis of heterocyclic amines such as those represented by Formula III has been reviewed in The Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, a series published by Interscience Publ., New York and London. Aminopyrimidines are described by D. J. Brown in The Pyrimidines, Vol. XVI of the series mentioned above, which is herein incorporated by reference. The 2 amino 1,3,5 triazines of Formula III, where A is A 1 and Z is N, can be prepared according to methods described by E. M. Smolin and L. Rapaport in Pyrimidines of Formula III, where A is A 1 and Y is an acetal or thioacetal substituent, can be prepared by methods taught in European Publication No. 84,244 published July 27, 1983 . Pyrimidines of Formula III, where A is A 1 and Y is cyclopropyl or OCF₂H, can be synthesized according to the methods taught in South African Patent Application No. 83 7434 and South African Publication No. 82 5045, respectively. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 2 or A 3, can be prepared by procedures disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,339,267. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 5, can be prepared by methods taught in U.S. Patent 4,421,550. Compounds of Formula III, where A is A 6, can be prepared by methods taught in European Publication No. 94,260 published November 16, 1983 . The preparation of the compounds of this invention is further illustrated by the following examples. A solution of 6.0 g of 4 chloro 1,3 dihydro 6 methyl oxofuro 3,4 c pyridine prepared using the procedure of W. F. Bruce and H. W. Coover, A solution of 6 g of the above thiouronium salt was dissolved in 10 sodium hydroxide. After 15 minutes the solution was acidified with 10 HCl. The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with water to provide the title compound as a yellow solid, m.p. 270 C. A mixture of 2.0 g of the compound from Example 2, 17 mL of water, 33 mL of methylene chloride and 2.1 mL of concentrated HCl was cooled to 5 C. Keeping the temperature between 5 and 10 C, 35 mL of a 6 sodium hypochlorite solution was added over 15 minutes. After an additional 20 minutes at 0 C, the mixture was poured into water and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic phase was washed with sodium bisulfite and dried over sodium sulfate. The solution of the sulfonyl chloride was cooled to 78 C and 5 mL of dry ammonia added dropwise. After slowly warming to room temperature, the mixture was acidified with 10 HCl to pH 2 and sodium chloride added to give a saturated solution. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain .25 g of the title compound as a solid, m.p. 211 213 C. To a suspension of .21 g of the compound from Example 3 and .25 g of N 4,6 dimethoxypyrimidine 2 yl phenyl carbamate in 2 mL acetonitrile is added .14 mL 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene. After 15 minutes, 6 mL water is added, followed by dropwise addition of 10 HCl. The resulting precipitate is collected by filtration and washed with water to provide .09 g of the title compound, m.p. 149 153 C. Using the procedures of Equations 1 21 and Examples 1 4, the following compounds of Tables 1 13 can be made by one skilled in the art. Where relevant, n 0 unless otherwise noted. Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99.9 solid or liquid inert diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example H. M.

These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The active ingredient is dissolved in a solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the material is warmed to evaporate the solvent. The material is allowed to cool and then packaged. The ingredients are blended and milled to pass through a 100 mesh screen. This material is then added to a fluid bed granulator, the air flow is adjusted to gently fluidize the material, and a fine spray of water is sprayed onto the fluidized material. The fluidization and spraying are continued until granules of the desired size range are made. The spraying is stopped, but fluidization is continued, optionally with heat, until the water content is reduced to the desired level, generally less than 1 . The material is then discharged, screened to the desired size range, generally 14 100 mesh 1410 149 microns , and packaged for use. The active ingredient is dissolved in the solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the blender is allowed to run for a short period and then the granules are packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all under 5 microns in size. The salt is added directly to the water with stirring to produce the solution, which may then be packaged for use. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce a material essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 screen 0.3 mm opening . The concentrate may be formulated further if necessary. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns. The material is sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 screen and then packaged. The ingredients are thoroughly blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in size. The material is reblended and then packaged. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 5 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. The active ingredient is blended with attapulgite and then passed through a hammer mill to produce particles substantially all below 200 microns. The ground concentrate is then blended with powdered pyrophyllite until homogeneous. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is reblended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The compounds of the present invention are expected to be active herbicides. They should have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, oil well sites, drive in theaters, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. By properly selecting rate, time and method of application, one may use the compounds of this invention to modify plant growth beneficially, or to selectively control weeds in crops such as wheat and barley. The rates of application for the compounds of the invention will be determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.01 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modification or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types.
