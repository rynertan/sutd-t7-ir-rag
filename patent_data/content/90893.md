# ROTATING TOOL WEAR MONITORING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A system is provided for predicting when the failure of a rotating machine tool or part is imminent or when a tool is worn. The system includes a transducer for producing an output related to the workpiece vibrations caused by the machine tool and an analog comparator which compares this output with a threshold signal related to the normal operation of the tool and established by a microcomputer which determines whether further signals which exceed the threshold are produced during each of a predetermined number of subsequent time intervals related to the rotational speed of the tool. If so, a failure signal is produced which may be used, for example, to cause retraction of the tool.
