# Heat exchange steam reforming process and reactor.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for the steam reforming of hydrocarbons in a reforming reactor by the passage of a feed stream comprising steam and one or more hydrocarbons as process gas under steam reforming condi tions and under external supply of heat through a given volume of steam reforming catalyst to form a product stream rich in hydrogen, comprising the following successive steps a passing the process gas through a first portion of the steam reforming catalyst constituting 25 75 thereof, heat needed for the endothermic reactions occurring in the process gas and for heating the process gas being supplied partly from a moderately hot flue gas as defined under b and partly from the product stream, and then b passing the process gas partly reformed in step a through the remaining portion of the steam reforming catalyst, the heat needed for the further endothermic reac tions and heating of the process gas being supplied by a hot flue gas generated by combustion of a fluid fuel, the hot flue gas being thereby cooled to form the moderately hot flue gas employed in step a . A reactor for use in this process is also described.
