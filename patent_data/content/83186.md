## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RET ATING TO ANTI ULCER DRUGS This invention relates to H2 receptor antagonists useful in treating peptic ulcers. More particularly the invention is concerned with novel pyrimidine derivatives having such properties. The most successful anti ulcer drug heretofore developed is cimetidine EMI1.1 see, for instance, U.S. Patent Specification No. 3,950,333 and J. Int. Med. Res., 3, 86 1975 . There can be no question that the advent of cimeidine has constituted a major advance in the treatment of peptic ulcers. Indeed, the total sales of this drug are now well in excess of one billion dollars. However, there have recently appeared in the medical press a number of articles concerning possible untoward side effects exhibited by cimetidine. Thus, there exists a continu ing need to discover new and effective therapeutic agents in this area having minimal side effects. In accordance with the invention it has been discovered that pyrimndine derivatives of formula XXEMI1.2 wherein R and R3 independently represent hydrogen or C1 C3 alkyl R represents hydrogen, Cl C3 alkyl, benzyl or benzoyl R2 represents hydrogen or C1 C3 alkyl or R1 and R2 taken together with the adjaacent nitrogen atom form a saturated heterocyclic ring containing from 5 to 7 ring atoms and optionally including a further heteroatom selected from oxygen and nitrogen X is S or O Z is 0, S or CH2 n is 2 or 3 when Z is O or S and n is 1, 2 or 3 when Z is CH R5 2 is H or CH3 m is 1, 2 or 3 A is C1 C5 alkylene or CH2 qX CH2 p wherein q and p are individually 0, 1, 2 or 3 and the sum of q plus p is 0 4, and B is H, CH3, C3 C6 cycloalkyl, a heteroaryl group optionally substituted with one or two C1 C3 alkyl, C1 C3 alkoxy, halo, hydroxy or amino groups naphthyl 1,3 benzodioxolyl 2,3 dihydro 1,4 benzodioxinyl phenyl optionally substituted with one or two C1 C3 alkyl, C1 C3 alkoxy, halo, OH, benzyloxy, CF3, C1 C3 alkyl O C1 C3 alkylene, phenoxy or di C1 C3 alkyl amino C1 C3 alkylene and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thermo, possess valuable anti ulcer properties. The heteroaryl group preferably contains 5 or 6 ring atoms and is for example an imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, triazolyl, pyridyl, thiadiazolyl, furyl or thienyl group. A preferred group of pyrimidines of formulaXX are those wherein R is hydrogen or C1 C3 alkyl, Rl and R2 are C1 C3 alkyl, R3 is hydrogen, R5 is hydrogen, n is 1, X is 0, Z is S, n is 2, A is CH2 and B is pyridyl optionally substituted by hydroxy, methoxy or methyl and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. When R1 and R2 form a heterocyclinc ring, examples of such groups which may be mentioned are piperidino, pyrrolilino and morpholino. In the above formula the 4 pyrimidone or 4 pyrimidinethione ring has been written with the following structure A EMI3.1 It should be recognized, however, that this structure is tautomeric with the following structures B and C EMI3.2 It is to be clearly understood that all such tautomeric equivalents are embraced by the present invention. Compounds according to structure A would be named systematically as 4 1H pyrimidones, those according to structure B as 4 1,3H pyrimidones, and those according to structure C as 4 3H pyrimidones. Again, regardless of which tautomer name is used to describe a given compound, the other tautomers are included within that name as forming part of the invention. In like fashion, the pyrimidine rings below exhibit enol keto tautomerismEMI4.1 with a mono hydroxy or mercaptopyrimidine. Again, such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the invention. Studies of 4 pyrimidinone tautomerism indicate that structures A and C exist in approximately equal amounts, and that structure B is formed where the substituent at C 2 is an electron withdrawing group.Otherwise the oxo forms A, B, C predominate over the enol forms D, , F . Bases falling within the scope of the above formula include 2 2 2 diethylaminomethyl 4 thiazolylmethyloxy ethylamino 5 2 oxazolyl methyl 4 pyrimidone. 2 3 2 3 dimethylamino propyl 4 thiazolyl methylthio propylamino3 5 3 4 methyl 3 isoxazolyl propyl 6 ethyl 4 pyrimidone 2 2 2 2 dimethylamino ethyl 4 thia zolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 2 3 1,2,4 triazolyl ethyl 4 pyrimidinethione 2 2 2 diamethylaminomentyl 4 thiazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 3 thiadiazolyl methyl 4pyrimidone 2 3 2 dimethylaminomethyl 4 thiazolylmethylthio propylamino3 5 2 dimethylaminomethyl 4 thiazolyl methyl 4 pyrimidone. 2 5 2 dimethylaminomethyl 4 thiazolyl pentyl amino 5 2 pyrazinyl methyl 6 methyl 4 pyrimidone 2 2 2 2 dimethylamino 2 methylethyl 4thiazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 2 imidazolyl methyl4 pyrimidinethione 2 2 2 1 dimethylamino 1 methylethyl 4thiazolylmethyloxy ethylamino 5 3 pyrazolyl methyl6 ethyl 4 pyrimidone 2 2 2 1 dimethylaminoethyl 4 thiazolylmethyl ethylamino 5 2 5 methyl 4 thiazolyl ethyl 4pyrimidone. 2 2 2 diethylaminoethyl 4 thiazolylmethyl thio ethyl 5 4 methyl 2 pyridyl methyl 6 ethyl 4 pyrimidone 2 3 2 di n propylaminomethyl 4 thiyzolyl methylthio propylamino 5 t2 2 pyridyl ethyl 4 pyrimidone 2 4 2 3 methylamino propyl 4 thiazolyl butylamino 6 methyl 5 2 thiazolyl methylthiomethyl 4pyrimidone 2 2 2 diethylaminomethyl1 5 methyl 4 thiazolylmethyloxy ethylamino 5 2 pyrimidinyl methoxymethyl 4 pyrimidone 2 3 2 2 dimethylaminoethyl 4 thiyzolyl propylamino 5 2 3 pyricazinyl 2 methylethyl 4 pyrimidone 2 2 2 methylaminomethyl 5 ethyl 4 thiazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 5 dimethylaminomethyl 2 furyl methyl 4 pyrimidone 2 2 2 2 aminoethyl 4 thiazolylmethyl Whio ethylamino 5 a naphthyl methyl 4 pyrimidone 2 2 3 aminopropyl 4 thiazolylmethyloxy ethylamino 5 5 dimethylanlnomethyl 7 thienyl methyl 4 pyrimidone 2 2 2 diethylaminomethyl 4 thiazolylmethyloxy ethylamino 5 3 4,6 dimethyl 2 pyridyl propyl 6 ethyl 4 pyrimidone 2 3 2 3 methylaminopropyl 4 thiazolyl propylamino 5 2 2,4 dichloro phenyl ethyl 4pyrimidone 2 4 2 dimethylaminomethyl 5 ethyl 4 niazolyl butylamino 5 p anisylmentyl 4 pyrimidone 2 5 2 2 dimethylamino 2 methylethyl 4 thiazolyl pentylamino 5 p tolyl methyl 6 n propyl 4 pyrimidinethione 2 3 2 3 dimethylaminopropyl 4 thiazolyl methylthio propylamino 5 2 2,3 methylenedioxy phenyl ethyl 4 pyrimidone, and the like. In Formula XX, the term C1 C3 alkyl includes methyl, ethyl, n propyl or isopropyl. Thus, the term C1 C3 alkylphenyl would include o, m and p tolyl, o, m, and p ethylphenyl and the like. Similarly, the term C,1 C3 alkoxyphenyl includes o, m, and p anisyl, o, m, and p ethoxyphenyl and the like. The term halophenyl includes o, m, and p chlorophenyl, bromophenyl, fluorophenyl and iodophenyl. Disubstituted phenyls such as 2,4 xylyl, 3,4 dichlorophenyl, 2 methyl 4chlorophenyl, 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl and the like are also included within the scope of the term substituted phenyl Substituted hetero aryl groups illustrative of those useful in my invention include 4 methyl2 thiazolyl, 4 chloro 2 imidazolyl, 5 methyl 3 pyrazolyl and the like. The term C3 C6 cycloal.kyl includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclopentyl all isomers , methylcyclobutyl, dimethylcyclobutyl and the like. The various heteroaryl groups which B can represent include 2 , 3 and 4 pyridyl, 2 , 4 and 5 pyrirnidyl, 2 or 3 thienyl or furyl, 2 or 4 imidazolyl, 3 or 4 pyrazolyl, 2 or 4 thiazolyl or oxazolyl, 3 , 4 or 5 isothiazolyl or isoxazolyl, 3 or 4 pyridazinyl, 4 1,2,3 triazinyl, 3 1,2,4 triazolyl or 2 pyrazinyl. The term triazole includes both 1,2,4 and 1,2,3 triazole rings bearing a side chain at any open position, and the term triazine includes all positions of the 3 nitrogen atoms with the side chain attached at any open position. Likewise, the alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, halo or amino substituents in the heterocyclic or alicyclic aromatic ring may occupy any otherwise unoccupied portions in those rings. A preferred group of radicals which B can represent includes 2,3 and 4 pyridyl substituted with one or two methyl, methoxy. or hydroxy groups such as 2 pyridyl, 3 pyridyl, 4 pyridyl, 6 methyl 3 pyridyl, 5 methyl 3 pyridyl, 2 methyl 3 pyridyl, 3 methoxy 4pyridyl, 2 methoxy 4 pyridyl, and 5 1, 3 benzodioxolyl . The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like, as well as salts derived from organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenylsubstituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aro matic sulfonic acids, etc.Such pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1,4 dioate, hexyne 1,6 dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, D hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, malate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphtha lene l sulfonate, naphthalene 2 sulfonate and the 1 like salts. Compounds according to XX above can have three or more basic centers. These are a strongly basic amine group in the aminoalkyl group attached at position 2 of the thiazole ring, a less basic in the amine attached to the pyrimidone ring at C 2 and the basic ring nitrogen of the thiazole. A fourth basic group can also be present depending on the nature of the substituent B for example, if B is pyridyl, the pyridyl nitrogen can form salts with strong acids.Thus, if a mineral acid is used, suc as HC1 or Br, trihydrohalide salts can be prepared. Monohalide or dihalide salts are also preparable by titrating a solution of the base with acid and then evaporating the solution of the partially neutralized base to dryness.Weaker acids, such as some of the organic acids enumerated above, will form a salt only with the most basic center in the 2 dialkylaminoalkylthiazole. The compounds of this invention wherein Z isS or O in other words, a heteroatom are conveniently prepared from a 2 aminoalkyl 4 thiazolyl methyl hetero atom alkylamine. The preparation of these starting materials is illustrated in Flow Chart A below using a compound in which the heteroatom is sulfur for exemplary purposes only. Flow Chart AEMI11.1 In the above Flow Chart, alk is conveniently methyl or ethyl and R11 R2, R31 R5, m and n have the same meaning as hereinabove. In accordance with the above procedure, an acid addition salt of an amioalkylthioacetamide I is reacted with a beta bromo alpha ketoester II such as ethyl bromopyruvate R3 H to yield an alkyl methyl or ethyl 2 aminoalkyl 4 thiazolecarboxylate III . Reduction of this ester with a suitable hydride reducing agent such as lithium triethylborohydride, lithium aluminumhydride, sodium borohydride, diisobutylaluminumhydride and the like yields the corresponding hydroxymethyl compound IV . Reaction of the 4 hydroxymethylthiazole with cysteamine or its higher homologue 3mercaptopropylamine in the presence of acid yields directly a 2 aminoalkyl 4 thiazolylmethylthio alkyl amine Va optionally substituted with an alkyl group in the 5 position of the thiazole ring. In the process indicated in Flow Chart A, in going from IV to Va, the hydroxymethyl group can be halogenated as with thionylchloride to yield a 4chloromethylthiazole and the chlorinated compound in turn reacted with the sodium salt of the particular mercaptoalkylamine. In fact, any standard leaving group a group labile to nucleophilic displacement can be employed hre in place of chloro in the chloromethyl side chain including for example p tosyloxy, mesyloxy methanesulfonyloxy , bromo, iodo and the like. Alternatively, the 4 chloromethylthiazole hydrochloride or other suitable acid addition salt can be fused with a mercaptoalkylamine salt such as a hydrochloride salt to yield the desired primary amine Va Z S . If it is desired to prepare the side chain oxygen analogue of Va z O , a process utilizing 2 chloroethylamine or 3 chloropropylamine to react with the 4 thiazolemethanol, under basic conditions, can be employed as well as can the analogous Williamson ether process using the sodium salt of the hydroxyalkylamine with a 4 thiazolylmethyl halide. The compounds of this invention can be prepared by reacting an amine of formula V with a pyrimidone carrying in the two position a group Q capable of undergoing nucleophilic displacement by a primary amine. The nature of such groups will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. However, as examples thereof there may be mentioned groups such as nitroamino, C1 C3 alkylthio, aralkylthio, typically benzylthio, halo, for instance, chloro or bromo, methylsulfinyl or methanesulfonyl. When Q is a nitroamino group a lower alkanol, such as ethanol, pyridine or acetonitrile can be used as the solvent, in which case it is preferred to heat the reaction mixture, conveniently at its reflux temperature. When Q is C1 C3 alkylthio, the reaction can be carried out at an elevated temperature, with or without va solvent.However, if it is desired to use a solvent, suitable examples are DMSO, DMF, pyridine or lower alkanols, for example ethanol. In general, the condensation reaction may be effected at temperatures between 50 and 150 C, typically at the reflux temperature of the most appro priate reaction solvent. FLOW CHART BEMI14.1 wherein R R3, R5, n, m, x, Z, A and B have their previous significance and Q is a leaving group, except that 1 2 R and R2 cannot both be H. The preparation of amines of formula V is described in European Patent Specification No. 49,618 and the preparation of the pyrimidines of formula VI in, for instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,216,318. Alternative processes are available for the preparation of the compounds of this invention. For example, the reaction scheme of Flow Chart B can be carried out with starting materials in which the roles are reversed i.e., the leaving group is attached to the thiazole moiety and the reacting group here OH orSH is linked to the pyrimidone as in Flow Chart C. FLOW CHART CEMI15.1 wherein R R3, R5, Z, A, B, m and n have their previous significance and L is a leaving group such as OH, O mesyl, O tosyl, C1, Br and the like. When L is OH, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a strong acid such as methanesulfonic acid or 12N hydrochloric acid.When L is a halogen C1 or Br or a halogenlike group tosyloxy or mesyloxy , the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as the alkali metal sodium salt of a lower alkanol, and the same lower alkanol is conveniently used as a solvent.Optionally, when L is a halogen such as C1 or Br, the reaction can be carried out at an elevated temperature in the absence of a solvent by employing each reactant in the form of an acid addition salt, preferably as hydrochloride salts. The reaction is normally effected using reaction temperatures in the range from 50 to 15O0C. It should be noted that the process of Flow Chart C cannot be used under acidic conditions if the group represented by B contains an ether function, such as a 6 methoxy 3 pyridyl group, since this ether group may be cleaved under the specified reaction conditions. A second alternative synthetic procedure involves the reaction of a guanidine derivative of formula IX with a substituted a acyl ester of formulaX according to Flow Chart D. FLOW CHART DEMI16.1 wherein R R3, R5, m, n, A and B have theIr previous meanings and Z is S. The reaction of Flow Chart D may be effected by heating 50 to 1500C the reactants in a mutual solvent, conveniently a C1 C3 alkanol in which the C1 C3 alkyl group is the same as that in the alkyl ester group of X, preferably in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal salt of the alkanol solvent. The N 2 2 aminoalkyl 4 thiazolylthio ethyl guanidine IX can be prepared from the primary amine V , by reaction with a salt of an alkylisothioureaEMI16.2 alkyl such as a methylisothiouronium salt where the alkylthio group is a leaving group.Alternatively, the product IX can be prepared by guanylating the primary amine V with 3,5 dimethylpyrazole l carboxamidine. In Flow Chart B, the pyrimidone or pyrimidinethione reactant VI has the structureEMI17.1 where Q is a leaving group such as nitroamino, C1 C3 alkylthio, benzylthio, halo, methylsulfinyl or methanesulfonyl. The pyrimidones X O are conveniently prepared by a reaction similar to the ring closure reaction of Flow Chart D optionally followed by an alkylation reaction. For example, the a acyl ester X can be reacted with thiourea to yield a 2 mercapto5 substituted 4 pyrimidone of the formulaEMI17.2 which intermediate can in turn be alkylated, as with an alkylhalide or dialkylsulfate, preferably in the presence of base to yield reactant VI of Flow Chart B wherein Q is a loweralkylthio C1 C3 S leaving group.The same compound can be prepared directly by reaction of the a acylester X wlth an S alkylisothiouronium salt preferably in the presence of base. When it is desired to prepare a pyrimidone VI irl which Q is nitroamino, the above a acyl ester is reacted with nitroguanidine in the presence of base, preferably a lower alkoxide in a lower alkanol solvent where the lower alkyl groups are the same. Compounds wherein X is S in VI in Flow ChartB are prepared by acylating a pyrimidone VI where Z is 0 with a dilower alkylthiocarbamoyl chloride C1 C3 alk 2 N C S. The O dialkylthiocarbamate thus prepared C1 is then thermally rearranged to yield the S dialkyl carbamate. Hydrolysis yields the desired pyrimidinethione VI where X is S . The substituted pyrimidones starting materials VIII of Flow Chart C can be prepared from VI according to the following reaction scheme. FLOW CHART EEMI18.1 where R, A, B, n and Q have their previously assigned meanings and z is O or S. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as a lower alkanol in the presence of an equimclar quantity of an alkali metal salt, preferably the sodium salt, of the lower alkanol. The pyrimidone or pyrimidinethione moiety of the compounds of this invention XX is substituted in the 5 position with the grouping A B where B may be an hydroxy substituted aryl or heteroaryl radical. These hydroxy substituted derivatives are conveniently prepared from the corresponding alkoxy substituted aryl or heteroaryl group B by hydrolysis for instance by reaction with conc. aqueous HC1 or 48 aqueous HBr in ethanol or other equivalent solvent at an elevated temperature. In the above reaction schemes, the aminoalkyl group present at position 2 of the thiazole ring has been shown as carrying through each of the reaction steps essentially unchanged from the starting material employed I in Flow Chart A . In those instances where it is desired that either RÚ or Rê or both be hydrogen in a final product XX , alternate procedures must be used. For example, where RÚ is hydrogen but Rê is alkyl, it is possible to carry a benzyl protecting group through a given reaction scheme to the preparation of the primary amine derivative V at which point the benzyl group can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation to give a secondary amine grouping NHRê. Similarly, an acyl protecting group can be used, such as a benzoyl group, and this protecting group removed by conventional means. Similarly, if it is desired te have a primary aminoalkyl group at position 2 of the thiazole ring, a protecting group such as the phthalimido group can be utilized. In such instance, the starting material I would be one in which RÚ and Rê when taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, form a phthalimido group. This grouping can be carried throughout the synthetic procedure until it is desired to remove it after reaction of the ethylamine V with the pyrimidone VI 3 by hydrazinolysis or other hydrolytic procedure Such a protecting group would be particularly valuable in those instances where it is desired to utilize a 4 chloromethylthiazole as an intermediate as in Flow Chart C.In the preferred synthetic procedure set forth in Flow Chart A, use of such protecting groups for a secondary aminoalkyl group at position 2 of the thiazole ring is not necessary. An alternate procedure for preparing intermediates useful in the synthesis of compounds of this invention XX starts with the reaction of dichloroacetone and a substituted amlnothioacetamide. The use of the resulting 4 chloromethylthiazole where not more than one of RÚ and Rê is has been discussed previously. However, this procedure is illustrated in FlowChart F below and is particularly valuable in preparing the compounds of this invention wherein both R1 and R2 are H. Flow Chart FEMI21.1 wherein R, R5, A, m and n have their previously assigned significances. In Flow Chart F, a 2 phthalimidoalkylthioacetamide is shown as reacting with dichloroacetone, following the procedure of J. Am. Chem. Soc., 64, 90 1942 , to yield a 2 phthalimidoalkyl 4 chloromethylthiazole. Reaction of this intermediate with a cysteamine or homocysteamine derivative in which the amine group is attached to a 4 pyrimidone of the desired structure provides a 2 phthalimido 4 thiazolyl derived tive XII which group can be deprotected with hydrazine to yield the 2 aminoalkylthiazole derivative XXa in which R1 and R2 are H. According to Flow Chart E the pyrimidone VI having a leaving group Q is reacted with cysteamine or homccysteamine or the corresponding hydroxy deriva tives to yield a 2 2 thio or o.xy ethylamino 5 substi tuted 4 pyrimidone VIII . Reaction of this pyrimidone with a 2 aminoalkyl 4 thiazolylmethylchloride XI under reaction conditions sufficiently basic to produce an anion, illustratively a mercapto anionEMI22.1 provides the compounds of this invention XX whereinZ is S or 0 except that RÚ or Rê may represent blocking groups . Alternatively, the 2 w mercaptoalkylamino pyrimidone VIII as an acid addition salt can be fused with an acid addition salt of the 2 alkylamino 4thiazolemethylchloride to yield the identical final product XXa. The chloromethylthiazole VII where L is C1 is readily prepared by chlorination of the corresponding hydroxymethylthiazole IV Flow Chart A with, for example, thionylchloride, PCl5, POCl3 etc. Alternatively, the procedure outlined in step one of FlowChart F can be utilized i.e., reaction of dichloroacetone with a phthalamidothioacetamide will yield directly a compound according to XI. The primary thiazolylalkyl amine reactants Vc V wherein Z is CH2 and n is 1, 2 or 3 can be prepared by ,the procedure illustrated in Flow Chart G below. Flow Chart GEMI24.1 wherein RÚ, Rê, R , R5, n and m have their previously assigned meaning and least one of RÚ and Rê must be C1 C3 alkyl.

The aqueous mixture was extracted 3 times with chloroform and the chloroform extracts discarded.The aqueous solution was then chilled to about OOC and 15.4 ml of 5N aqueous hydrochloric acid added. 2 Nitroamino 5 4 pyridyl methyl 4 pyrimidone formed in the above reaction precipitated and the precipitate was collected by filtration. The filter cake was washed with water and dried. 9.9 g of product were obtained melting at about 228 2290C. Following the above procedure, sodium methoxide and nitroguanidine were heated to form the sodium salt. 17.8 g of ethyl 2 formyl 3 2 pyridyl propionate prepared as described in United States Patent 4,216,318 were added thereto. 2 Nitroamino 5 2 pyridyl methyl4 pyrimidone was isolated and purified by the above procedure. The compound melted at about 195 1970C. yield 17.2 g . The compounds of this invention are potent H2 receptor antagonists and thus potential anti ulcer agents. The relation of the H2 receptors to mammalian gastric secrection is described in an article by Black et al. Nature, 236, 385 1972 . The following assay for H2 receptor blocking activity was employed. Female albino rats were treated with estrone 24 hours prior to the initiation of the experiment. The rats were sacrificed and the uterine horns removed therefrom and suspended at ambient temperature in isolated organ baths containing De Jalon s solution. After equilibration, the uterine strips wereexposed to 50 millimole aqueous potassium chloride, which produced a sustained contraction. When the uterus is so contracted, histamine produces a dosedependent H2 receptor mediated relaxation. A control dose response curve to histamine is constructed on each tissue.Following thorough washout of the histamine after obtaining the control dose response curve, each antagonist a compound of this invention was added for 30 minutes at a concentration of 10 5 molar. The uterine strips were then contracted with aqueous potasslum chloride in the presence of the antagonist and 2 second dose response curve to histamine obtained. In the presence of a competitive antagonist, the doseresponse curve to histamine was shifted in parallel to the right with no depression of the maximum relative to the control curve. The dose ratio DR is calculated for each concentration of antagonist by dividing the EDso of histamine in the presence of the competitive antagonist by the control ED50 for histamine.The dissociation constant KB of the antagonist is calculated from the dose ratios by the following equation KB antagonist DR l Cimetidine was included as an internal standard. Results of the above assay carried out on selected compounds of this invention are set forth inTable 1. In the table, column 1 gives the name of the compound under test and column 2, the losKb value for that compound.

Pathology and Pharmacology, 13, 149 1976 .The assay is carried out as follows The gastric mucosa of the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana is separated from the musculature of the stomach and placed between a pair of Ussing chambers made of lucite. The chambers are filled with frogRinger solution and acid secretion is stimulated by addition of histamine to the serosal side of the mucosa at a final concentration of 10 5M. Acid output is automatically titrated to pH 4.5. After steady response to 10 M of histamine is established, the antagonist a compound of this invention is added to the serosal chamber and the maximal inhibition by each concentration of the H2 antagonist is recorded. From the dose response curve, the ED50 of the drug is calculated. Results obtained with compounds of this invention in this assay are set forth in Table 2. In Table 2, column 1 gives the substituent at 6 in the pyrimidone ring, column 2 the B group see formula at the head of the Table , and column 3 the molar ED50.

A steady state gastric secretion is produced by the iv infusion of histamine.The antisecretory drugs under test are given either intravenously by infusion over a 30 minute period or orally 75 min. prior to collection of gastric secretion from the fistula. In this assay, 2 2 2 dimethylaminomethyl 4 thiazolylmethylthio ethylj amino S 3 pyridyl methyl 4 pyrimidone was llX cimetidine by the iv route and 14X cimetidine orally. The 6 methyl3 pyridyl analog was 14.4X cimetidine intravenously. According to these and other tests, the compounds of this invention are more active than cimetidine, particularly when given orally The compounds are also apparently much longer acting than cimetidine since recovery from an effective dose of 2 2 2 dimethylaminomethyl 4 thiasolylmethylthio ethyllamino 5 3 pyridyl methyl 4 pyrimidone is about 25 after 3 4 hours at which time cimetidine shows about a 508 recovering of acid secretions. It is a further advantage of the compounds of this invention that they also possess H 1 histamine preceptor inhibitory action, and thus can affect those physiological states which are produced by a mixture ofH1 and H2 histamine receptor stimulation. In utilizing the compounds of this invention as antisecretory agents, either the parenteral or oral route of administration may be employed. For oral dosage, a suitable quantity of a free base of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof formed with a non toxic acid such as a hydrochloride salt is mixed with one or more conventional excipients such as starch and the mixture placed in telescoping gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets, each containing from 50 400 mg of active ingredients per dosage unit. The tablets may be scored if lower or divided dosages are to be used. For parenteral administration via an iv infusion, an isotonic solution of a salt is preferably employed although a soluble free base is also useful in isotonic preparations. However, the oral route of administration is preferred. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises as an active ingredient a compound of formula XX, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, associated with one or more pharmaceuticallyacceptable carriers or excipients therefor. Because of the higher oral absorption and longer duration of action of the compounds of this invention, it is believed that oral administration of about 50 80 mg three to four times a day will suffice to control acid secretion in ulcer patients and thus alleviate ulcer symptoms. Generally, however, the compounds of this invention will be administered to humans orally in a daily dosage range of 140 800 mg.Smaller dosages at more frequent intervals may also be employed. The preferred oral dosage range is about 2 5 mg kg day of mammalian body weight, although a dosage range of from l iO mg kg day will include a great majority of patient regimes.
