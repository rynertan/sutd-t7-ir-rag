## Description
MEANS AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING LUMEN OUTPUT AND POWER CONSUMPTION OF PHOSPHOR EXCITABLE LAMPS This invention relates in general to certain new and useful improvements in a means and method for reducing power consumption of one or more lamps in a circuit arrangement and correspondingly reducing lumen output to a uniform lumen output level, while maintaining efficiency of operation of the lamps and the power source connected to the lamps. In many cases, conventional fluorescent light fixtures are constructed so as to physically retain and energize a pair of phosphor excitable lamps, such as fluorescent lamps. The ballast and circuitry in these fixtures are typically designed so that two lamps in a two lamp fixture, for example, are essentially electrically 180 degrees out of phase. Two lights in a fixture or otherwise lights in pairs are employed to reduce the noticeable effects of flicker, even though the extra lumen output of the two lamps are not necessarily required. It is possible to eliminate one or more lamps of the fixture without appreciably reducing total light output so that inefficiency and eye fatigue do not result. However, the removal of one of that lamps, particularly in a series connected circuit of the lamps resulted in a very substantial inefficiency of operation. If the remaining lamp was able to operate at all, depending upon the circuit configuration, then there was a resultant inefficiency in that the remaining lamp produced less light output for a given level of power consumption. In order to obviate these problems, there has been an introduction in the market place of the so called phantom tube1 . These phantom tubes, in one embodiment, employ a capacitor connected between the sockets fro which a lamp was removed, such as the type described in U.S. Patent No. 3,956,665 to Westphal. In other cases, the phantom tube relied upon a non reactiva lamp circuit, as for example, as described in U.s. Patent No. 4,053,811 to Abernathy. There has been at least one attempt to reduce power consumption and also lumen output in a circuit configuration as taught in U,S. Patent No. 4,135,115 to Abernathy et al. However, in the Abernathy et alPatent, the device which is utilized is rather complex and includes a step up transformer, as well as a plurality of capacitors and a resistive element. U.S. Patent No. 3,954,316 to Luchetta et al discloses a circuit for controlling the lumen output and power consumption of phosphor excitable lamps in a rap d start circuit arrangement. Specifically, the Luchetta Patent discloses an inductive device such as a transformer with a capacitor connected across the primary and secondary coils of that transformer. The present invention provides a means for limiting power consumption and lumen output of a phosphor excitable lamp connected to a source of power for operation of the same and which means permits such reduction without appreciable loss in efficiency or operation of either the lamp or the source of power.

Referring now in more detail to the drawings, Figures 1 and 2 ebow a conventional fixture 10 of the type which holds and provides for energization and resultant lumen output of phosphor excitable lamps, e.g. fluorescent lamps. The fixture is generally provided with an outer housing 12 having a generally rectangular shape, as illustrated. Moreover, depending from 8 bottom wall of the housing 12 are two pairs of connector platen 14 and 14 and 16 and 16 , as more fully illustrated in Figure 2 of the drawings. Each of the connector plates is provided with sockets of the type normally found ir conventional fluorescent light fixtures. Thus, for example, the connector plates 16 and 16 are provided with sockets 18 and 18 respectively. Moreover, these sockets are typically bayonet type sockets and include the conductors therein for creating ar electrical circuit through the phosphor excitable lamp, such as 2 lamp L. Figure 6 schematically illustrates a pair of conductors 2C in the socket 18 of the connector plate 16. Moreover, and ir this case, the electrical conductors 20 which are often referred to as conductive terminalst, are connected in spaced apart relationship. In this way, a single pin tube may be used tc establish contact between the two conductive terminals 20. Also normally included within the housing, although it may be located elsewhere, is a conventional ballast 22. The ballast is electrically connected to the sockets and particularly thf conductive terminals 20 in the sockets 18 and 18 . The embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 8 is generally designed for, although not exclusively designed for, the instant start circuit and the embodiment in Figures 9 X14, is generally designed for the rapid start arrangement. In any event, the fixture is generally designated so that two or more phosphor excitable lamps, such as the lamps designated as L1 and L2 inFigure 2, are connected in a series relationship with respect to each other or with respect to the ballast 22 or other power source. In like manner, the fixture may be provided with a fuse cup 24 for retaining a fuse in the electrical circuit including the ballast 22. The typical fluorescent lamp comprises a tube 26, which is shown as having a straight glass tube, although the tube often adopts other shapes, as for example, a circular shape, or the like. One end of the tube is provided with a base or end cap 28 having one or more electrical terminals 30 at each end, often called end terminals . A similar end cap 32 having one or more terminals 34 one as shown is located at the opposite end of the tube 26. Figure 3 is a somewhat schematic representation of the alteration occurring in the circuit arrangement when a load limiting control device of the present invention is used with one or more lamps. The device is always used in a series connection with a single lamp with respect to a power source. In the event one or more lamps are connected with respect to a power source, such as a ballast, in a series arrangement, the load limiting control device is also always used in a series circuit connection. The term power source is also deemed to include that source of electrical power which may be the line power such as a 110 volt AC electrical circuit, or otherwise, the ballast itself.Thus, in some cases, the input power is introduced directly into the ballast, as in the so called instant start arrangement.Nevertheless, the ballast in this case is also deemed to be the power source or a part of the power source. In the embodiment of the device illustrated in Figures 1 7, the device is often referred to as a capacitive device inasmuch as the primary electrical control element is capacitive in nature. In this case, it can be observed that the device A included a disc like housing 36 which is capable of being fitted within the socket 18 of the connector plate 16. Moreover, the end pin or end terminal of the lamp is adapted to be inserted into the housing 36, in the manner as hereinafter described. The load liwiting or capacitive device A of the invention is more fully illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 of the drawings. In this case, the device A includes the outer housing 36. Moreover, included within the outer housing 36 is a first electrically conductive element 38 which is provided with a projection 40 extending beyond the housing. In this case, the projection 40 has essentially the same size and overall shape as the terminal pin 30 of the lamp. In addition, the housing 36 is sized to extend into the socket or at least a portion of the socket 18, as aforesaid. Thus, when the housing is so inserted, the projection 40 will contact the conductors 20 within the socket, much in the same manner as the end pin 30 on the lamp L.It should also be understood, in connection with the present invention, that when bi pin or double pin lamps are used, the device A would also be provided with a similar pin arrangement. This latter double pin arrangement is usually empioyed with the rapid start circuit arrangement. The device A also includes a second electrically conductive element 42 which is spaced from and insulated from the conductive element 38 by an electrically non conductive element 44. The housing is also provided on its right hand end, reference being made to Figures 5 and 6, with a recess 46 which opens into the conductive element 42. Thus, when the load limiting control device A of the invention is used, the end terminal or pin 30 on the lamp L will extend through the recess 46 and contact the conductive plate 42. By reference to Figure 6, it can be observed that the housing 36 is preferably in the form of a relatively thin disc like member. Where the capacitor cannot be included in the housing, a pair of leads 48 and 50 are connected to the respective electrically conductive elements 38 and 42 and which are in turn, connected to a capacitor 52. The capacitor itself may also be enclosed within a suitable housing, in the manner as illustrated in Figure 4. The load limiting control device is also designed and sized so that it is capable of being disposed within a socket of the connector plate. However, it should be understood that the capacitive device could be designed so that it fits over the end of the pin on the tube, with the prong of the device extending into contact with the conductive elements in the socket. In the embodiment of the device as illustrated,. it can be observed that the housing 36 is preferably formed of an electrically non conductive material. In this way, if a capacitor is still charged when one attempts to remove the capacitive device, there will be no potential damage or injury. When any of the 1 load limiting control devices of the inventi,on are used, an entirely different circuit path is established. In this case, as opposed to a circuit path being created from the terminal, e.g. the terminal pin 30 on the lamp directly to the conductive terminal 20 in the socket, the path is created through the terminal pin 30, the conductive element 42, the capacitor 52, the conductive element 38, projection 40 and then the conductive terminal 20. The capacitor has a capacitive value established 8o as to minimize any power factor loss or load control loss and to maintain a high degree of efficiency of operation. The capacitive value may range from about eight microfarads to about fourteen microfarads and preferably should range from about two microfarads to about twelve microfarads. It has been found that on the average, electrical power reduction is about 30 in a two lamp circuit arrangement and the illumination is reduced about 27 . Equally important is the fact that the ballast and the lamps and the like of these components are not damaged. Figure 7 illustrates one preferred embodiment of a device B which may be used. In this case, the device B generally comprises an outer housing 54 which is preferably formed of a non conductive material and which is provided with a central opening 56 along one of the flat walle thereof. Located within the housing 54 is an electrically conductive strip St which is curved and shaped so as to form a sha,pe similar to that of the projection 40. Moreover, the shape of the strip 58 which forms this projection is similar to that of a pin, such as the terminal pin 30 on the lamp.The strip 58 does not extend all the way into the housing but is spaced apart from a similar strip 60 which is secured within the housing 54 and extends outwardly therefrom to aid in the formation of a shape equivalent to that of the projection. Also located within the housing 54 is a second conductive strip 62. The conductive strip 58 is connected to a first electrically conductive wire 64 by means of a clamp 66. A second electrically conductive wire 68 is connected to the strip 62 by means of a clamp 70, also in the manner as illustrated in Figure 7. These two electrically conductive wires 64 and 68 would be suitably connected to a capacitor, such as the capacitor 52. The right hand end of the housing 54 is provided with a recess 72 having a size and shape similar to the terminal pin 30 on any one of the fluorescent lamps. In this case, the recess is at least partially open so that a terminal pin on the lamp will contact the conductive strip 62 located adjacent to the recess. Also located within the housing 54 is an insulator which surrounds the conductive strip 62 and electrically insulates the same from the conductive strip 60 or the conductive strip 58 which forms the projection. In this way, the equivalent structure of that illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 is achieved. Figure 8 illustrates a device C which is designed to fit over the end of a pin on a fluorescent tube and have a projection thereof extend into the socket of the lamp. The device C generally comprises an outer housing 80 which is preferably formed of an electrically non conductive material, such as a plastic, or the like. Extending outwardly from one side of the housing 80 is a metallic prong 82 which is of a size similar to that of a pin on the end of a fluorescent lamp. Thus, this projection 82 is sized to extend within the socket which normally receives a conventional fluorescent lamp. The projection 82 is provided with an outwardly flaring flange 84 serving as a terminal within the housing 80. An electrically conductive wire 86 is connected to this flange 84.In addition, a cylindrically shaped ring 88 is also located on the opposite side of the housing with respect to the projection 82 and is effectively electrically insulated by the housing from the flange 84. The ring 88 is also electrically connected to a conductive wire 90. Moreover, the conductors 86 and 90 are connected to a capacitor of the type previously described. Figure 17 illustrates an instant start circuit arrangement in which a pair of fluorescent lamps L1 and L2 are connected in series. In this case, a load limiting control device, e.g. a capacitive device, has been used with the lamp L2 Figure 18 illustrates a circuit arrangement very similar toFigure 17 although two such fixtures using the instant start circuit arrangement are connected in series. Here again, the capacitive device is shown as being located in conjunction with the lamp L1 in one of the fixtures and a similar lamp L1 in the next adjacent fixture. No capacitive devices are used run connection with the lamps L2 in either of these fixtures. Figures 9 16 and 19 more fully illustrate an embodiment of the invention used with the so called rapid start circuit arrangement. In this case, a load limiting control device designated by reference numeral 100 and forming this embodiment of the invention is used to connect a typical conventional rapidstart lamp L1 to the sockets 18 and 18 , respectively, in connector plate 14 and 14 which form part of a conventional fluorescent lamp fixture. In the instant start lamp arrangement, typically one pin is centrally located on each of the opposite ends of the lamp and the fixture is adapted to have one pin receiving aperture on each of the opposite sides to receive the associated pins. In the rapid start circuit arrangement, the lamps are typically provided with a pair of spaced apart conductive pins or terminals on each of the opposite ends of the lamp. In the embodiment of the invention as illustrated inFigures 9 and 10, it can be observed that one end of the lamp the right hand end, as illustrated is normally inserted into the socket 18 of the connector plate 14 . However, the opposite, or left hand end of the lamp L as shown in Figures 9 and 10, is displaced downwardly from the socket 18 in the connector plate 14 in the final connected position. Rather, the left hand end of the lamp L is connected to a first portion of the load limiting control device 100 and which also has a second portion connected to the socket 18 and the connector plate 14. The load limiting control device 100 is more fully illustrated in Figures 9 and 10 and generally comprises a main outer housing 102 preferably formed of an upper section which is designated by reference numeral 104 and the lower section which is designated by reference numeral 106. The outer housing 102 is preferably formed of a molded plastic material. The outer housing 102 is preferably formed with the upper section 104 and the lower section 106 in such manner that the upper section 104 is capable of being inserted into a socket in the fixture and the lower section 106 is capable of receiving one end of the lamp t. Referring to Figures 9 and 10, as well asFigures 13 15, it can be observed that the upper section 104 is actually the upper section when fitted within the socket of a fixture. The conventional fluorescent lamp is normally inserted into a socket and rotated approximately 90 degrees to be retained therein. Figure 11 illustrates an embodiment of the invention where one end of the tube is fitted within one socket of the fixture and the opposite end of the tube is fitted within the load limiting control device. However, when in the final mounted position, the second end is offset laterally from the other end or first mentioned end of the tube as opposed to being disposed below the first mentioned end of the tube. The lateral offset is preferred where tolerance space is not sufficient for two or more lamps in certain fixtures. The lower section 106 is formed of a front wall 107, and a rear wall 108 connected by a bottom wall 109. A somewhat Ushaped upper wall 110 connects the front and rear walls in the manner as illustrated1 and as best seen in Figures 13 15. The somewhat U shaped upper wall 110 actually forms a receptacle constructed and arranged so as to receive the end portion of a conventional phosphor excitable lamp. The front and rear walls 107 and 108 respectively, along with the bottom wall 109 and upper wall 110, are all integrally formed together, and form an upper load limiting electronics receiving compartment 112. Disposed over the right hand end of the housing 102 and rigidly secured thereto iF an end wall 114 to enclose the upper load limiting control electronics compartment 112. At its lefthand end, the housing 102 is similarly provided with an end wall 118 which is typically adhesively secured to the housing 102. Integrally formed with the lower end of the end plate 118 is an extended section 120 which is designed with an internally formed socket 122, the latter also having a pair of spaced apart pin receiving receptacles 124. In this case, the pin receiving receptacles 124 are each located and sized so as to receive the pair of end pins on the lamp L. The upper housing section 104 is similarly provided with a pair of outwardly struck spaced apart pins 126, which protrude through the end plate 118, and which are located and sized so as to extend into the pin receiving receptacles 127 formed in the socket 18 on the connector plate 14. Located within the load limiting control electronics component compartment 112 is a capacitor 128 and a transformer 130, the latter primarily serving as an inductive device.Furthermore, a temperature sensitive current control device, as for example, a so called thermal cutoff 132, is also connected in series with the capacitor 128 and is also connected across a primary coil 134 and a secondary coil 136 forming part of the transistor or similar inductive device. This electrical circuit arrangement is more fully schematically illustrated in Figure 16 of the drawings. The electrical components, in the compartment 112 are electrically connected to the pins 126 and also to the pin receiving receptacles 124 in the desired electrical arrangement.The physical connections therefore are more fully illustrated inFigures 13 15 of the drawings. The capacitor 128 is again interposed in a circuit arrangement so as to alter the original electrical circuit path between the source of power and the lamp. This holds true even with the presence of the inductive device, as for example the transformer 130, and even the inclusion of the temperature control device 132. When further considering Figures 9 10 and 12 15, it can be realized that the lamp is initially inserted within the receptacle created by upper wall 110. Thereafter, the lamp iS rotated in the device until it is retained therein. Next, the pins at the opposite end of the lamps L are inserted into the socket 18 and the pins 126 are inserted in the pin receivinc receptacle 127. Thereafter, the lamp and the device are simultaneously rotated along the axis of the lamp, 90 degrees se that the lamp is slightly below the original socket. Figure 12 of the drawings illustrates an embodiment of th invention where a load limiting control device 100 is used at th left hand end of the fixture and a load limiting control device 140 is used at the right hand end of the fixture. The load limiting control device 140 is substantially identical to the load limiting control device 100 as previously described, except for the fact that the load limiting control device 140 does not include any of the electronic components as previously described. The load limiting control device 140 does not establish any different form of electrical circuit path, since the alteration of the circuit path is created by the load limiting control device 100. The device 140 permits both ends of the lamp to be located essentially at the same elevation. In one specific embodiment of the device 100, the housing 102, has an overall vertical dimension of approximately two inches, the end walls 114 and 118 each have an approximate thickness of about 0.080 inches in maximum. In addition, the socket formed by the wall 108 has a radius of approximately 0.750 inches. Further, the diametrical center point of the socket is spaced from the lower edge of the housing 102 by approximately 1.0 inch. Figure 19 illustrates a socket arrangement using one standard form of rapid start ballast designated by reference numeral 142. The ballast is connected to a pair of lamps L1 with the load limiting control device inserted with respect to the lamp L1 The most efficient results have been obtained when the capacitor 128 has a value of approximately 3.5 microfarads. A 4 microfarad capacitor was used in the device and was connected in series with one of the fluorescent lamps in a two lamp fixture. The lamps gave off 65 foot candles with a 0.80 amp and 120 volt power source and which created 88 watts of active power. However, there was 97.2 watts of apparent power. The power factor was approximately 90.5 withan apparent 54 savingsIn energy. In another embodiment, a 5 microfarad capacitor was used with an input power of 0.80 amps and 120 volts presenting 96 watts of active power. In this case, it was determined that there was a 1008 power factor with no loss of power whatsoever but with a significant reduction in the amount, of power used to illurinate the lamps. With a 2 microfarad capacitor, it was found generally that the power was reduced about 50 although the lumen output was reduced approximately 60 . Therefore, while the invention is operable with capacitors having a capacitive value of less than 33 microfarads and greater than 6 microfarads it is preferable to employ capacitors within the range of 4 to 5 rnicrofarads. Figures 20 26 illustrate a load limiting control device 150 which can be hard wired directly into the circuit. While this embodiment of the invention does not use an adaptive device for interfitted positioning between a socket and an end of a lamp, it is nevertheless highly efficient in avoiding wire tying and wrapping. The load limiting control device 150 generally comprises an outer housing 152 in the form of a rectangular casing. The housing 152 is normally provided with a cover plate 153, hereinafter described in more detail, but which has been removed in Figures 21 and 22 for purposes of clarity and for more fully illustrating the present invention. The load limiting control device 150 comprises Mi 1Ls within the housing 152 an inductive device, such as a transformer 1548 a capacitor 156 and a bleeder resistor 158.Referring to Figure 21 it can be observed that the transformer 154 comprises a primary coil 160 and a secondary coil 162. The capacitor 156 is connected across the coils 160 and 162 in the manner as illustrated. Furthermore, a fuse 164 may be interposed, in the same path as the capacitor 156. Finally, the bleeder resistor 158 is connected in parallel with the capacitor 156. A pair of conductors 166 from the primary coil 160 are connected to the interior end of a quick connect and disconnect assembly 168.In like manner, a pair of conductors 170 from the secondary coil 162 are connected to the interior end of another quick connect and disconnect assembly 172. Each of the quick connect disconnect assemblies 168 and 172 are substantially identical in construction and one of these assemblies 172 is more fully illustrated in Figures 23 26 of the drawings. The quick connect disconnect assembly 172 is generally comprised of an outer housing section which may be an integrally formed extension or protrusion 174, in the manner as illustrated in Figures 20 26 of the drawings. The extension or protruberance 174 is provided with a pair of conductor receiving openings 176 and which are designed and sized to receive the insulated ends of electrical conductors of the type normally found in ballasts and lighting fixtures. The openings 176 lead into tapered apertures 178 having an inner end of reduced diameter. The openings 176 have a pair of upper lugs 180.which cause them to be of a non circular cross section at their upper ends for facilitating insertion of a so called extraction tool . Located within each of the openings of each of the quick connect and disconnect assemblies 168 and 172 are spring like conductive retainer strips 182. The retainer strip 182 may be secured to the lower portion of the recess at point 184 in the manner as illustrated. An electrical conductor 186 having a stripped terminal end 187, that is a conductor wire without electrical insulation, can then be inserted into the opening 176.The stripped terminal end of the conductor will bias the innermost end 188 of the retainer strip downwardly along the tapered aperture wall as best illustrated in Figure 26. When it is desired to remove the terminal end 187 of the conductor from the quick connect disconnect assembly 172, a suitable implement, such as a screw driver, S is inserted into the opening 176 between the spaced apart legs 180 along the upper portion thereof. The flat end of this implement, such as a screw driver, will thereupon force the innermost end 188 of the retainer strip 182 downwardly, as shown in Figure 26, thereby permitting release and withdrawal of the terminal end 187 of the conductor 186. Located interiorally within the housing and forming part of the quick connect disconnect assemblies are chamber forming walls 190 which form interior chambers 192 and which are in col2ounication with the apertures 178. Furthermore, each of the retaining walls 190 are provided with horizontally extending shoulders 194 and which extend toward the outer end wall 152. In this way, a conductive connector strip 196 is locateg wltshi nçtate housing and retained by the shoulder 194 and the chamber forming wall 190. The conductive strip 196 has a vertically disposed leg 198 located over the inner end of the aperture 178. In this way, a stripped terminal end 187 will engage the vertical leg 198.In some embodiments, the inner end 188 of the retaining strip 182 can be connected to the vertical leg 198. The cover plate 153 is also provided with a pair of spaced apart downwardly projecting tabs 200 integrally formed on the under surface of the plate 153. The tabs 200 will engage a horizontally disposed leg of the conductive connecting strip 196 as well as a vertical leg portion thereof in the manner as illustrated in Figure 26 and thereby hold the conductive connecting strip 196 in place. The electrical conductor 170 can be connected to an inner end of the connector strip 196. The cover plate 153 is also provided at its opposite ends with grooves 201 designed to receive screws or like fastners for securement to the under surface of a light fixture. The cover plate 153 may be provided with adhesive strips 204 on its upper surface and which are provided with releaseable backings for adhesively securing the device 150 to a suitable supporting structure. It is only necessary to cut wires leading to a ballast, strip the terminal ends and merely insert the terminal ends into the quick connect and disconnect assemblies 168 and 174. Thus, it is not necessary to engage in stripping an end portion of another wire, tying the wires toge ther and thereafter wrapping same to provide electrical insulation. Wires are inserted adjacent the lower portion of the opening and over the leaf contacts 182. When it is desired to remove the wire, it is only necessary to insert the blunt but narrow end of an extraction tool such as the too S into the opening 176 adjacent the upper portion, as shown in Figure 24.The end of the extraction tool will bear against the spring retaining leaf or blade 182 and bias the same downwardly, thereby permitting the terminal end of the conductor to be removed. Figure 27 illustrates a circuit arrangement using the lumen control device 150 of the invention. In this case, it can be observed that the conductors from a secondary winding 202 in a transformer or ballast 203 to the heater or filament coil in a fluorescent tube 204 are severed and trimmed so that insulation around the terminal portions of the conductors are removed, exposing the conductor wire. The conductive terminals are then inserted into the quick connect disconnect assemblies as previously described so that the load limiting control device 150 is inserted into the circuit. It can be observed that it is not necessary to connect another load limiting control device 150 in circuit between another transformer secondary coil 206 and 8 filament coil in a second fluorescent laPp 208. In many cases, particularly in other electrical supply systems, starter switches 210 are often located within the circuit arrangement. The starter switches 210 are illustrated in dotted lines in Figure 27 since they are, in many cases, not employed. When the starter switch is present, it is sometimes necessary to bypass the starter switch or to provide an auxillary form of delay start bypass switching circuit. one s1u t delay bypass switching circuit is more fully illustrated in Figure 29 of the drawings. In this case, it can be observed that there is a delay switching circuit 212 interposed. in one of the conductors wh ich is normally connected between the secondary winding 202 and the filament heater of the lamp 204.Further, it can be observed that a load limiting control device 150 has been inserted into one of the conductors. Figure 28 illustrates a modified form of light circuit arrangement in which the load limiting control device 150 may be used. In this case, individual starters 210 are connected across the respective filament coils at each end of a fluorescent tube. A delay bypass switching circuit 212 is connected across the load limiting control device 150 in Figure 29. The delay bypass switching circuit essentially operates in two modes which can be described as a straight through mode and a bypass mode . The delay bypass switching circuit generally comprises a simple timing device along with the capability of a resetting function. In the case of the resistive capacitive circuit, a charge is built up on the capacitor. When power is delivered, a glow coil can cause a discharging of the capacitor. The discharging of the capacitor will thereupon provide a voltage for introduction into the filament circuit of the lamp. When it is desired to energize the lamps, that is to turn the light on, the delay switching circuit 212 operates in the bypass mode so that the load limiting control device 150 is bypassed and current is supplied to the lamp directly through conductors 214. There is then a delay of a predetersined time period, as for example, 500 mlliseconds. The device will then switch to the direct through rode in which current passes through the load 14 miting control device 150 and the latter operates in the manner as previously described. The delay bypass switching circuit 212 will permit operation in the direct through mode until such time as the lights are turned off. At that point, the delay switching circuit de energizes and resets to the bypass stage as aforesaid, so that the lights can be re energized at a later time.
