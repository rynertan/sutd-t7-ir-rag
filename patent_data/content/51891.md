# Improved polyethylene oxide cake with reduced gelling for flush toilet wastewater sanitation.

## Abstract
Solid cake compositions comprising three essential components polyethylene oxide resin, a nonsolvent resin coating liquid, preferably a perfume, and a surfactant. The components are mixed to form an extrudable mass and the mass is extruded into a log. The log is then cut or sliced into individual cakes. The compositions have reduced gelling characteristics, which reduce the ten dency of the resin to form a gel when the cake is con tacted with water. The cakes are useful in dispensers which are employed in the flush tank of a toilet to automatically dispense chemicals to the flush water. The polyethylene oxide resin dispensed into the wastewater minimizes aerosolization of the wastewater which oc curs when the toilet is flushed.
