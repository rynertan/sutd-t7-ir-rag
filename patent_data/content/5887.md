# Drive.

## Abstract
A drive, comprising a number of bodies of revolution 3 which are pressed against at least one intermediate plate 4 by a drivable first structural member 1 and which can roll thereon. The intermediate plate 4 is connected to the outgoing part 5 of the drive and is supported by a second, plate shaped structural member 6 . The intermediate plate 4 is flexible in the direction transversely of the second plate shaped structural member 6 and the material of the intermediate plate 4 has a modulus of elasticity which at least equals the modulus of elasticity of the material of the second plate shaped structural member 6 .
