# METHOD FOR BONDING A CONTACT.

## Abstract
A method for bonding a contact which includes the steps of measuring at a predetermined interval the distance of the gap between upper and lower electrodes 1 , 2 pressing a contact 5 and a rest 6 under constant pressure, and then controlling the current supply between the upper and the lower electrodes 1 , 2 after a predetermined interval from when the distance of the gap reaches a maximum value 18 . According to this method, the amount of metal melted out internally from the contact interface between the contact 5 and the rest 6 is made constant and the quality of the bond between the contact 5 and the rest 6 is improved and stabilized.
