# A RESIST FOR VACUUM ULTRAVIOLET LITHOGRAPHY

## Abstract
This invention concerns with patterning a device subs trate by depositing a layer of resist over the substrate and selectively exposing the resist to a ultraviolet radiation. The improvement resides in the use of vacuum ultraviolet radia tion and of a resist comprising a copolymer of methylmethac rylate and methacrylic acid in which the methacrylic acid is present in concentration of from 0.05 to 40 percent by weight.
