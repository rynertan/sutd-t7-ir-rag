# Magnetic memory device capable of memorizing information in a stripe domain in the form of a vertical Bloch line pair.

## Abstract
In a magnetic memory device comprising a magnetic medium 21 having an easy axis of magnetization orthogon al to a principal surface of the medium, the medium has at least one stripe domain 20 surrounded by a domain wall which memorizes information in the form of a pair of vertical Bloch lines. Each pair is written in one end of the domain by supply of a local magnetic field to the one end when no magnetic bubble exists in the proximity of the one end. Each information is specified by absence or presence of each pair and successively transferred along the domain wall by a pulsed bias magnetic field. Readout operation is carried out at a preselected end of the stripe domain by supply of another local magnetic field to the preselected end to selectively chop the preselected end into a magnetic bubble only when each pair exists in the preselected end. Thus, presence and absence of each pair is converted into presence and absence of the bubble.
