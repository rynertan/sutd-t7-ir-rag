# Gas phase nitration of chlorobenzene.

## Abstract
A method is provided for controlling the para ortho isomer distribution in nitrochlorobenzene product mixtures by the vapor phase nitration of chlorobenzene in the presence of a molecular sieve catalyst having a relatively small pore size ranging from about 5 Å to about 10 Å.
