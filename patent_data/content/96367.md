# Apparatus for preventing thermal seizure of a turbo supercharger drive shaft.

## Abstract
In a first embodiment, a thermal sensor senses the temperature of exhaust from an internal combustion engine.

## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to an engine cooling fan control apparatus, and more particularly to apparatus for preventing thermal seizure of the drive shaft of a turbo supercharger installed in the engine. In an internal combustion engine with a turbo supercharger which discharges compressed air to the engine to improve engine output, the drive shaft common to the exhaust turbine and the compressor of the turbosupercharger is subjected to hot exhaust gas so that the shaft has a tendency to be seized by its bearings. The present invention provides an apparatus which senses the temperature of exhaust to drive a turbo supercharger shaft cooling means when the sensed temperature exceeds a predetermined value, thereby preventing seizure of the shaft by its bearings. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a diagramatic illustration of a preferred embodiment of a turbo supercharger shaft cooling apparatus according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a view, similar to Fig. 1, of a second embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the timer ofFig. 2. The same reference numerals are used to designate similar elements of the embodiments shown in the figures. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a preferred embodiment of a turbo supercharger shaft cooling apparatus according to the present invention. In the particular embodiment, a battery 1 is adapted to supply electrical power to a fan motor 4, installed to cool the engine compartment, via a fusible link 2 and a fuse 3 when the circuit is closed, thereby.driving fan motor 4 to cool the engine compartment and therefore the exhaust turbine shaft and its bearings which are subjected to hot exhaust.Switch 5, acting as a thermal sensor1 is closed when the exhaust temperature exceeds a predetermined value, and is open when the exhaust temperature falls below the predetermined value. Fusible link 2 and fuse 3 are for protection of battery 1 and the whole circuit from shortcircuiting and or malfunction of motor 4. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown a second embodiment of a turbine shaft cooling apparatus according to the present invention . In addition to the previously described cooling function while the engine is running, this embodiment ensures that the turbine shaft and bearing will be cooled for a predetermined interval after the ignition key is turned off when the exhaust temperature exceeds the predetermined value because the temperature of the engine compartment tends to rise greatly after the engine is turned off. In this embodiment, battery 1 has one electrode grounded and the other electrode connected via fusible link 2 and fuse 3 to one terminal of fan motor 4, the other terminal of which is connected to a control terminal C of a timer 6 which serves to control the operating interval of motor 6.The power supply for timer 6 is provided by connection of a power supply terminal B thereof to the output of fuse 3. Timer 6 has an ignition detection terminal Ig to detect the off state of an ignition switch 7. Terminal Ig is connected via a fuse 8 to a terminal of ignition switch 7, the input of which is connected to the output of fusible link 2. Fuse 8 has the same function as fuse 3. In Fig. 3, power supply terminal B is connected via a stabilizing power source SB and an analog switch AS to a power supply line B for an amplifier 10. When ignition switch 7 is closed analog switch AS is actuated via input terminal Ig and a resistor rl to supply the stabilized supply voltage via B to amplifier 10.Returning to Fig. 2, an exhaust temperature sensor 9, provided in the exhaust manifold, not shown, senses the temperature of exhaust and outputs a signal to amplifier 10 when the sensed temperature is above a predetermined value, for example 7000C. Sensor 9 may be a conventional semiconductor thermal sensor. Amplifier 10 amplifies the signal from sensor 9 and supplies the amplified signal ST to timer 6. Amplifier 10 is supplied with electrical power from terminal B only while ignition switch is on. Timer 6 may have a structure such as shown in Fig. 3. In this particular structure, an AND gate receives a drive input via resistor rl and an inverter INV from terminal Ig while ignition switch 7 is open.A level adjust circuit including a Zener diode ZD, a resistor r2 and a capacitor C1 adjusts the voltage at the control input terminal of analog switch AS and at inverter INV to a desired value. Another drive input ST is supplied from amplifier 10 to the AND gate. A hold circuit comprising a resistor r3 and a capacitor C2 holds the value of ST for a short time, for example 1 second. The time constant determined by r3 and C2 is selected to be greater than that determined by C1 and r2 of the level adjust circuit.When the AND gate outputs a high level signal, a monostable multivibrator M M produces a high level signal continuing for a short predetermined time of from 1 to 3 minutes, thereby turning on a transistor Tr via an OR gate for that interval to operate fan motor 4. For as long as the signal ST persists, transistor Tr is also turned on via the OR gate, thereby operating fan motor 4 for that interval during which the exhaust temperature exceeds the predetermined value. In operation, during engine operation, exhaust temperature sensor 9 continuously checks the temperature of exhaust. When sensor 9 detects that the temperature of exhaust exceeds the predetermined value 7000C in this particular embodiment , sensor 9 outputs a signal and therefore amplifier 10 outputs a constant level d.c.voltage signal as signal ST to timer 6 which drives motor 4 via the OR gate and transistor Tr for as long as signal ST persists. When ignition switch 7 is opened, the Ig control input to analog switch AS disappears, and analog switch AS is turned off, thereby interrupting the supply of electrical power to amplifier 10. At this time, the output signal 8T from amplifier 10 disappears, but the value of ST immediately before 5T disappears is held by the hold circuit. Thus, both inputs to AND gate are high so that monostable multivibrator M M produces an output continuously for 1 to 3 minutes. Thus the engine compartment, turbo supercharger shaft and bearings are cooled whereby seizure of the drive shaft is prevented. The temperature of exhust corresponds accurately to the temperature of turbine shaft. After engine stops, the temperature of the exhaust system can rise to a value higher than any other system in the engine compartment.Thus, it is most recommendable to sense the temperature of exhaust itself in order to prevent seizure of the turbo supercharger shaft by its bearings. While the present invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited thereto. Various modifications and changes could be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention, as set forth in the attached claims.
