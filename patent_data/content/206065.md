## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to methods of diagnosing and detecting various cancers, changes in cancerous conditions, and cancer susceptibility, by determining levels of proto oncogene and oncogene related proteins in extracellular biological fluids. PRIOR ART Weinberg, Scientific American 249 126 142 1983 , provides an overview of the state of the art up to 1983.The reference discusses, e.g., the steps leading to the identification of proto oncogenes and oncogenes, the RAS group of oncogenes, and point mutations which result in oncogenes. Wigler, et al, in U.S. Patent Serial No. 595,745, filed April 2, 1984, disclose the N RAS oncogene, which was derived from a human bladder carcinoma cell line. Wigler et al, in Serial No. 595,744, also filed on April 2, 1984, discloses Ki RAS oncogene or, rasKi , derived from human lung carcinoma. Lane et al, in PNAS 78, 5185 5189 1981 , andShilo et al, Nature 289 607 609 1981 , disclose that cells which take up oncogenes become transformed, and will form tumors in mice. Parada et al, Nature 297 474 479 1982 ,Santos et al, Nature 298 343 347 1982 , and Yuasa et al,Nature 303 775 779 1982 , all disclose gene point mutation of p21, which result in altered p21 protein, at either amino acid residue 12 or 61. Marshall et al, in Cancer Survey 3 183 214 1984 , disclose that residue 12 is most frequently altered. Furth et al, J. Virol. 43 294 304 1982 disclose antibodies which do not discriminate between proto oncogene and oncogene p21. Hand et al, PNAS 81 5227 5231 1984 disclose monoclonal antibodies which react with p21. The antibodies were not shown to be specific for either oncogene or protooncogene p21 protein. Slamon, et al, Science 224 256 262 1984 disclose that various intracellular oncogene and proto oncogene protein levels are associated with different carcinomas. BACKGROUND The study of cancer and its causes has made remarkable progress in the last decade. Among the most significant of the advances in the field has been the discovery of a genetic basis for the onset of cancer, that is, the discovery of proto oncogenes and oncogenes. As is described by Weinberg, Scientific American 249 126 142 1983 , it was discovered that there are sequences of DNA in cells which have potential to become implicated in cancer. These normal genes are known as proto oncogenes. Under normal circumstances, these genes may code or express normal proteins which are involved in cellular processes, such as cell growth and growth regulation. As with all genes, these may operate on a continuous, or intermittent bases. For various reasons, and because of various factors, proto oncogenes may become transformed into oncogenes. It has been learned that the transformation takes place at the level of single nucleotide bases, or, by point mutation of the proto oncogene. Weinberg, supra.The change in a single nucleotide base causes the resulting protein to differ in one amino acid residue. Remarkably, this difference of one amino acid can change the growth rate of the cell containing it by a factor of anywhere from 10 to 1000. The past few years have seen the discovery of many proto oncogenes which, in turn, become transformed into oncogenes. Slamon, supra, e.g., lists various oncogenes, and the tumors associated therewith. Slamon, et al, supra, disclose the presence or absence of various intracellular oncogene products, when various tumor types are observed. This information is presented in Table I, viz TABLE I Number Typ of tumor of abl fes fqs fms myb myc rasHa rasKi src tumor Renal mallgnarn Renal cell Carcinoma I 0 0 C 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 4 O 0 0 0 0 5 O O 0 O O O 0 O 0 6 0 0 O 0 O 7 O O O O O S O O O 0 0 9 o O O 0 Gynecologic malignancies Ovarian adenocarcinoma 1 0 0 0 O o 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 C 0 0 0 5 O O O O 6 0 0 O 0 0Uterine adenocarcinoma 1 0 0 O 0 0 0 0 0 0Germ cell tumor 1 0 O 0 O 0 Gastrointestinal malignancies Colon adenocarcinoma I O O 0 O 0 2 O O O O O 3 0 0 0 0 g A 0 0 C o o S O O RTI ID 4.32 O O O Rectal adenocarcinoma I O O 0 0 o 2 0 0 O O O O 0 o 3 0 0 O .

Until the development of the invention as described herein, any and all work involving the detection, labelling, and analysis, either quantitative or qualitative, of oncogene and proto oncogene proteins, involved analyses of intracellular material. Representative of the state of the art is, e.g., Johnsson et al, PNAS 82 1721 1725 March 1985 , e.g., which compares platelet derived growth factor to V sis oncogene product. The oncogene product is obtained by lysing freeze thawed cells. Papageorge, et al, Mol.Cell. Biol. 4 23 29 January 1984 , disclose a discovery of a p21 mammalian ras related protein produced bySaccharomyces cerevisiae. To obtain the protein, cells had to be centrifuged, and extracts were prepared. There was no analysis of the cell culture medium, because, up to the present, it has not been thought possible to detect oncogene and proto oncogene proteins in extracellular materials. While it may appear routine to expect that intracellular proteins, such as proto oncogene and oncogene related proteins may be found in extracellular fluids, such is not the case. Many intracellular proteins never leave the cell, because of their association with various intracellular processes. In the case of oncogene related proteins, this is especially true. As has been pointed out, supra, the normal intracellular proteins which are transformed into oncogene proteins, are thought to be associated, e.g., with cell growth processes, as well as intracellular regulation. There would, therefore, be no expectation that these proteins could be found outside of the cell. The new, and surprising discovery that oncogene and proto oncogene related proteins are found in extracellular fluids is important and useful to the field of cancer diagnosis. The proto oncogene and oncogene proteins have been associated with cancer of various types.Detection of the protein molecules in extracellular fluids, such as serum, and blood, and exudates such as urine, saliva, sweat, sputum, and the like, will indicate not only that cancer is present, but may be used, e.g., to determine that the chances of an individual patient developing cancer may increase or decrease. For example, it is generally known that exposure to certain carcinogens sometimes leads to increased rates of cancer. Examination of individuals before, and after exposure to a carcinogen, such as asbestos, would now enable one to determine if increased oncogene or proto oncogene related proteins are present, and hence if the risk of developing cancer has increased.Further, an individual s body fluids may be assayed during cancer therapy to determine if the protein levels have decreased, and hence if the cancer has receded. Both of these aspects are a marked improvement over the usual surgical biopsy, which must be performed to determine presence or recession of cancer. The invention also allows for determination of the phenotype , or category, of cancer of a patient diagnosed as carcinogenic. Many types of cancer are associated with one or more particular oncogenes Slamon, supra , and determination of what protein s is or are present, using, e.g., antibody assays, allows one to determine the particular type of cancer, and then a method of therapy for treating the patient. The fact that the proteins are found in extracellular fluids means that cell samples of the individual patient need no longer be taken, and the concomitant involved process of cell lysis, fractionation, etc., may be avoided. It is standard practice in medical examinations to administer tests which involve analysis of body fluids e.g., blood tests, urine tests . Samples taken for old tests may now also be used to determine presence and levels of oncogene and proto oncogene proteins. The patient does not have to undergo biopsies, radioactive assay series, and so forth. Instead, analysis of the protein content of the individual s samples of serum, blood, urine, etc., may be used to determine the presence of cancer, changes in susceptibility to cancer, or in a cancerous condition. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES Figure 1 gives a standard profile for the fractionation studies described herein. The standard profile represents the conditions used for all fractionations described herein. Figure 2 is a fractionation profile for one of the six samples used, and shows the twenty six different fractions obtained. It is noted that albumin is the eleventh fraction. Figures 3 8 show the dot blotting results Column X as compared to controls, for the serum samples described herein. Figure 9 shows the results of SDS gel studies on pooled fractions of the serum samples, which showed strong possibility of containing RAS protein. Figure 10 is figure 9 after treatment to remove albumin. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS EXAMPLE 1 I. Fractionation of Serum Samples Serum samples were collected from different sources fetal serum 12 week pregnancy serum 40 week pregnancy serum 16 week amniotic fluid 40 week amniotic fluid and serum from a patient with uterine cancer . These samples were then fractionated using an FPLC fast protein liquid chromatography system, including anion exchange mono Q , and salt gradient elution 0.5 ml of serum sample used . Figure 1 shows the standard profile under the conditions used. Figure 2 shows the profile for one of the samples pregnancy serum weeks . Only one profile is given because, with minor variations, all profiles were alike. Twenty six separate fractions of each serum sample were thus collected. These were analyzed for detection ofRAS or RAS related proteins. II. Dot Blot Immunoassay The twenty six tractions obtained from each sample were dot blotted for immunoassay. In this method, aliqus of each sample 150 ul were dot blotted to nitrocellulose filters. The filters with the blotted samples are then exposed to rabbit A anti RAS antibody dilution 1 100 , and incubated under conditions favoring the binding of this antibody to any epitopes present in the nitrocellulose filter. Following the first incubation, a second sample of antibody, i.e., 1251 labelled goat antirabbit IgG antibody is contacted to the filter, and incubated. These second antibodies will bind to any antibodies from the first sample which have become bound during the first incubation. The filters are then exposed to X ray film, and the results are shown in Column X of Figures 3 8. III. Results After the two incubations and the X ray film exposure described in II, supra, the film is developed and compared to a control i.e., a sample incubated with normal, non immunized rabbit serum, and then 125I labelled second antibody. Analysis of the film shows some non specific binding in the first few fractions, and this is probably due to human IgG. As will be seen, particularly in Figures 3, 4, and 8 pregnancy sera and tumor serum , there is specific binding for RAS protein especially in the latter fractions especially 12 18, and 23 25 . These are all post albumin fractions i.e., albumin is fraction 11 . In order to further confirm the presence of RAS type proteins in the samples, fractions were pooled where dot blot assay showed positive results for example, samples 15 18 of pregnancy serum, samples 13 16 for tumor serum .Control sera for normal males and females were also used. The pooled samples were concentrated, and run on sodium duodecyl sulfate SDS polyacrylamide gel, in order to separate the proteins on the basis of size. Separated proteins in the gels were then transferred to filters by electrophoretic blotting, and the filters were exposed, first to rabbit A. Anti RAS antibodies were incubated, and then to 1251 protein A or 125I goat anti rabbit anti RASIgG, again followed by incubation. Exposure to X ray film produced the results shown in Figure 8. Lanes 13 18 show strongly the presence of a 21K protein. These lanes represent 16 week pregnancy serum 13 and 14 , 40 week pregnancy serum 15 and 16 , and tumor serum 17 and 18 . Lames 5 8 are control sera. Lanes 13 18 also show strongly a 14K protein, which is probably a breakdown product of 21K protein. The higher molecular weight bands are thought to represent binding of the 1251 antibody, described supra, to human immunoglobulin. Removal of the immunoglobulin eliminates these bands. A 30K protein band is noticeable, particularly in lanes 3 and 4. These lanes represent tumor patient serum. Albumin was then removed from all the samples, as it distorts the gels. Tests were run, again, and these results are shown in Figure 9. Figure 9 shows that the drastic treatment to the sera has probably resulted in removal of all 21K protein. A band of approximately 31K remains, especially in lanes 15 and 18 ovarian cancer patient, with extensive disease .Lane 14, a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, shows higher weight proteins, while lane 7, a patient with cancer tumors of unknown origin, shows lower weight proteins. Additional tumor sera show dense labelling also. Exposure of these sera to agarose protein A removes higher weight components e.g., 50 60K , but not the 31K protein, which is probably being recognized by the RAS antibody. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that various other embodiments of this invention are possible.For example, it is known that in patients with RAS related cancer, the normal immune response will often result in the presence of antibodies in biological fluids of the patient.The method, as heretofore described, would allow one to detect the presence of these antibodies in patients. EXAMPLE 2 The steps set forth in Example 1 are employed for analysis of blood, plasma, urine, and biological exudates, such as saliva, sputum and urine. EXAMPLE 3 The steps set forth in Example 1 are employed to analyze an extracellular biological fluid for the presence of abl related proteins.

EXAMPLE 17 The steps set forth in Example 1 are employed to analyze an extracellular biological fluid for the presence of yes related proteins. EXAMPLE 18 An individual is diagnosed as having cancer, but the particular type of cancer has not been determined. A sample of serum is assayed with a panel of monoclonal Ha Ki antibodies to abl, fes, fos, fms, myb, myc, ras , ras and src related oncogene proteins. Positive results are found for the fos, myc, rasHa and rasKi mAbs. While all of these titers are high, reaction with fos is extremely high.Based on this, and other observations, the individual is diagnosed as having a gastrointestinal related carcinoma. EXAMPLE 19 An individual who has suffered from leukemia and has undergone chemotherapy for a period of time is examined for presence of fes and myb oncogene proteins in his blood. The blood assay indicates very low levels of fes and myb oncogene proteins, indicating that the cancer is currently in remission. One skilled in the art will recognize that there are other apparent aspects of the invention as well. For example, haptens, labelled enzymes, and the like, may be used to detect the presence of the oncogene and proto oncogene related proteins. The terms and expression which have been employed are used as terms of description and not of limitation, and there is no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features shown and escribed or portions thereof, it being recognized that various modifications are possible within the scope of the invention.
