# SEALANT APPLYING APPARATUS

## Abstract
An apparatus for coating the threads of articles such as fasteners, pipes, plugs, valves, fittings, etc., includes an indexing table for intermittently moving the articles along an arcuate path, rotatable article spindle assemblies on the table radially spaced apart an equal distance and being stopped at a dispensing station and at a wiping station spaced therefrom equal to such distance. A dispensing head at the dispensing station includes a nozzle for delivering a coating of the sealant onto the threads of a rotating article, and a wiper wheel at the wiping station wipes the coated threads and presses the coated sealant into the thread roots during rotation of the wheel which likewise rotates the coated articles.
