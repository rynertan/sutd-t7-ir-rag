# TRANSCUTANEOUS NERVE STIMULATION DEVICE WITH SENTINEL

## Abstract
A sentinel system is provided for a transcutaneous nerve stimulation device in which a sentinel pulse of known characteristics is produced at the device output prior to the production of a stimulation pulse. The output response is measured during the time of sentinel pulse production, and a sentinel warning signal is produced if an undesired output response is measured to alert the user to a potentially hazardous condition.
