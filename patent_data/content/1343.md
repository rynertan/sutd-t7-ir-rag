# Rivet packs and method of loading hollow rivets.

## Abstract
A method and assemblage for loading hollow rivets on to a headed mandrel so that they can be set in a pull through blink riveting operation. The mandrel M is threaded into the sleeve of an assemblage comprising a sleeve 5 on which a column of hollow rivets R are assembled head to tail and the rivets are transferred to the mandrel while the sleeve is withdrawn.

## Description
Rivet packs and method of loading hollow rivets This invention concerns a method and assemblage or rivet pack for loading hollow rivets on to a headed mandrel so that they can be set in a pull through blind riveting operation. In one kind of blind riveting operation, a column of, four example, 30 to 60 rivets is assembled head to tail on a headed mandrel. The mandrel is inserted in a blind riveting tool which has means for gripping and pulling the mandrel through a rivet to set it, the rivets in the column being set successively. This kind of blind riveting is refsrred to as pull through blind riveting . A mandrel for use in pull through blind riveting has to be of high quality to ensure that it is strong enough not to break while yet it is thin enough to be received in the bores or the rivets. Therefore, a mandrel is an expensive item which is reloaded with a fresh column of rivets when one column has been expended. Reloading a mandrel with rivets by hand by positioning them one by one on the mandrel is laborious and is customarily avoided by packaging the rivets, in line head to tail, betwesn strips of card or tape, slotted if need be to receive the rivet heads, and the mandrel is threaded through all the rivets and the card or tape stripped away.This procedure has the disadvantages that it is expensive, clumsy, and causes an inconvenient amount of waste packaging material, This invention has the object of pro viding a method of loading hollow rivets which avoids these disadvantages and an assemblage for use in such a method. It has been proposed to thread a column of rivets on to a wire on which they are placed in a jig which has a longitudinal channel for the rivet shanks and transverse grooves for their heads. When the rivets are in the jig, the wire is removed and the mandrel is inserted. This procedure has the disadvantage that a jig is required and a different jig is required for each rivet size. A method according to the invention comprises threading the mandrel into a sleeve on which a column of hollow rivets are assembled head to tail and transferring the rivets to the mandrel while withdrawing the sleeve. An assemblage of hollow rivets according to the invention for use in a method according to the invention comprises a column of hollow rivets assembled head to tail on a sleeve. In order to prevent any possibility of a mandrel being threaded into an assemblage from the wrong direction, in another aspect of the invention the end of the sleeve into which the mandrel is not to be inserted is sealed. Preferably, to achieve a desirable clearance between the rivets and the mandrel the sleeve is cylindrical and has a wall thiokness of approximately 2.5 of the external shank diameter of the rivets. In order to aid in transferring the rivets to the mandrel, the sleeve is flexible and extends far enough beyond the head of the rearmost rivet in the column to enable the sleeve to be pinched on to the mandrel to provide a grip thereon. The sleeve is preferably made of plastics material, for example polypropylene and acetal resin.Plastics materials also have the advantages of lightness and corrosion resistance and a range of colours can be used for identification purposes. In order to prevent the rivets from falling off the sleeve, the sleeve is deformed at its ends. Preferably the end of the sleeve towards which the shanks of the rivets point is flared outwardly which also facilitates the introduction of a mandrel. In order to assist in the riveting operation, the sleeve carries a lubricant which becomes transferred to the mandrel head. An example of a method of loading hollow rivets on to a headed mandrel according to the invention and an assemblage for use in this method are described in detail hereafter and are illustrated by the accompanying drawings. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view of an assemblage of hollow rivets Figure 2 is a side view of the assemblage shown in Figure 1 and Figures 3, 4 and 5 are perspective views of successive stages of a method of loading hollow rivets. The assemblage shown in Figures 1 and 2 comprises a column of hollow rivets R assembled head to tail on a sleeve S. The ends of the sleeve S are deformed to prevent the rivets R falling off the sleeve S, the end F of the sleeve S towards which the shanks of the rivets R point being split at C and flared outwardly both to prevent the rivets R falling off and to facilitate introduction of a mandrel M into the sleeve S, and the other end T of the sleeve S, i.e. the end into which the mandrel M is not to be introduced, being sealed and flattened in an axial plane so that its width in that plane is increased. The sleeve S is cylindrical and flexible being made of plastics material, viz. polypropylene. The rivets R have an external shank diameter of 0.32 cms and the sleeveS is a sliding fit within the rivets R having a wall thickness of o.oo8 cms. Thus, the wall thickness of the sleeveS is approximately 2.5 of the external shank diameter of the rivets R. The sleeve S carries a lubricant L Figure 2 at the end F thereof which becomes transferred to the head H of the mandrel M. The lubricant L may be encapsulated so that it becomes effective when the cap.sules are ruptured under pressure during a rivet setting operation. In the method of loading hollow rivets R on to a headed mandrel M so that they can be set in a pullthrough blind riveting operation illustrated by Figures 3, 4 and 5, the assemblage shown in Figures 1 and 2 is taken in one hand and the mandrel M in the other Figure 3 . The tip of the mandrel M is introduced into the sleeve S through the flared end F and the mandrel M is pushed through the sleeve S until its tip reaches the sealed end T of the sleeve S, whereupon the operator pinches the sleeve S at P thereby gripping the mandrel M.Thus, the sleeve S extends far enough beyond the head or the rearmost rivet R in the column to enable the sleeve S to be pinched on to the mandrel M to provide a grip thereon.The mandrel M has now been threaded into the sleeve S. The next stage of the method Figure 4 is transferring the rivets R to the mandrel M while withdrawing the sleeve S. The rivets R are slid along the sleeve S until the foremost rivet R reaches the mandrel head H while the mandrel M is gripped at P. As the column of rivetsR moves along the mandrel M, however, without interrupting the relative movement between the rivets R and the sleeveS. the operator slides the sleeve S off the mandrel M, leaving the rivets on the mandrel M Figure 5 . The pressure applied by the operator closes the flared end F of the sleeve S to allow the rivets R to pass over the end F and as they do so they collect lubricant L from the end F and transfer it to the mandrel M. Whereas the sleeve S is of tubular form, a sleeve in accordance with the invention could be of C shaped cross section such a sleeve would preferably extend at least 1200 around a threaded mandrel. Such a sleeve made of flexible material has the advantage of being useable with a range of mandrel sizes.
