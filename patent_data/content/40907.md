# Apparatus for determining time code addresses at low tape speeds.

## Abstract
For determining the address, in terms of its respective longitudinal time code, of a selected information signal recorded on a tape which has both longitudinal time codes and control pulses or control track signals, when the in formation signal is selected while the tape is being moved at a speed which is insufficient for the reliable reading of its longitudinal time codes, the tape is accelerated to a speed sufficient for the longitudinal time codes to be reli ably read by reader 80 and a subsequently encountered longitudinal time code is read, the reproduced control pul ses are counted by a counter 88 between the time that an information signal is selected and the time that the subsequently encountered longitudinal time code is read, and a derived address of the information signal is deter mined, by circuit block 94 , in terms of its longitudinal time code, as a function of the value of the encountered longitudinal time code and the count of the reproduced control pulses.
