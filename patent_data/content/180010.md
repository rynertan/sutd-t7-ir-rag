# PROCESSING MATERIALS IN FURNACES

## Abstract
A structure is shown for achieving low oxygen content high quality atmosphere surrounding a workpiece as it is processed in the reducing atmosphere of a furnace. The structure is a container which encloses the workpiece and functions as a catalyst for the reaction of H2 and O2 in an H2 containing atmosphere, i e., H2 and forming gas, etc. The structure of the enclosure or container includes a bottom tray or boat 10 which is coated with a metal such as platinum and a top or cover 12 made from metal screening or metal coated screening which metal may also be plati num. The bottom tray may also be composed of mesh or screening material as an alternative to being solid. Platinum is a preferred embodiment for the metal boat and screen because it is an excellent catalyst for the reaction of O2 and H2 and is active at temperatures at least as low as 150 C. One or more workpieces may be disposed in the boat so they are surrounded by the catalyst metal. The catalyst reaction depends upon gas contact with the surface, and the screening offers a large surface area which enhances this contact while still allowing the furnace gases to flow and convectively heat the workpiece.
