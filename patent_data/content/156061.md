## Description
PERSONAL PROTECTION FIREARM This invention relates to a personal protection firearm of a nature which is easy to transport on a person s body and is also easily made available for use. Generally employed for the purposes of personal protection are banguns. Drawbacks of the usual handguns are that size and weight make the gun difficult to carry and conceal, or keep in a safe place. Also, where a handgun is used for self defence, the g√ºn has to be removed from its carrying position, often a holster, and such removal can be difficult for the user to achieve in a stress situation. When a handgun is used for protection, usually one or possibly two rounds are fired.Either the handgun has been removed from the user at such a juncture in time or the attacker has been struck and the. gun is no longer required. In consequence of the difficulties associated with using a handgun, and the delays in removing it from its carrying position, handguns are ofte n removed frown a would be user prior to same being fired. This is particularly so in a close combat situation. There is thus a need for a firearm which need not be removed from its carrying position prior to its being fired, which can be brought into an operative condition more easily than conventional handguns, which is suitable for close combat situations and which can be sighted and fired swiftly and easily. in accordance with this invention there is provided a firearm characterised by comprising a support member shaped to be sorn on an extremity of a user s arm and assuming the form of a complete or incomplete finger ring for one or more fingers or a wrist band, a breech block carried by the support member and defining the rear end to at least one barrel and associated firing chamber in the support member, the firing chamber being capable of accommodating a cartridge therein, a firing pin arrange ment for firing such a cartridge, and a trigger for activitating said arrangement, the trigger mechanism being located to be oper able by part of the same hand as that on which the support member is located in use. Further features of the invention provide for the support member to be removably fitted to, or to form an integral part of, an endless band adapted to receive one or two fingers there through and in each case having an axis extending in the direction of such fingers, in use, and, in particular, for the support member to define a finger ring for the axis of the barrel to extend in a direction substantially parallel to the axis of the support member for the support member to have only one barrel1 or alternatively, two parallel barrels offset laterally relative to each other for each barrel to include a cocking mechanism and a flap movable between a position in which it covers the outlet end of a barrel and a position in which it acts as a flash protector to the user in which latter position it extends roughly parallel to the axis of the barrel and for the cocking mechanism to.be a laterally extending slide movable in the support member to cock the trigger mechanism and movable also in the same plane but in an opposite direction to release the trigger mechanism. The invention also provides for the or each barrel to be axially movable within a bore in the support member and relative to the breech block against spring loading thereof and for such axially movable barrel to have a laterally generally radially extending.slide extending through a slot in the support such that the slide serves as a means for cocking and firing the firearm. The barrel is preferably rotatable, at least to a small extent, so that the slide can co operate with a notch in the slot to hold the barrel in cocked condition and from which it can be released to fire the firearm. It will be understood that where the barrel is axially movable in the support it can be supported at both its front and rear ends at the instant of firing as will be appreciated from the following detailed description. The firing pin mechanism may be adapted for use on rim fired cartridges, in which case it may be located for co operation with the forward edge of the rim of a cartridge as opposed to the usual practice of the rear surface of such rim . Preferably, however, where the barrel is axially movable, the firing pin can be carried by the breech block and may be fixed or replaceable relative to such breech block. The breech block is conveniently a screw threaded plug removably associated with the support at the rear end of the barrel and is removable to provide access for loading the firearm. Such plug shaped breech block can be shaped so that the skirt thus formed can interfere with movement of the slide described above in a safe angular position of breech block but a recess in the skirts edge aligns with the slot in a firing position. The caliber of the chambers or barrels may be of a small bore of the order of 0,22 inches or 5,Smm. The chambers can be adapted to accommodate many different types of ammunition and, apart from standard bullets, hollow point and flat headed bullets can be used. Further types of lethal and non lethal ammunition can be employed in the firearm of this invention, these including blank cartridges, flare firing cartridges, cartridges containing s hot and also cartridges to propel drug darts, gas and the like. Also small rocket propelled and tracer cartridges could be projected from the firearm. In instances where the cartridges to be fired are non lethal, the outlet end of the barrel can be choked such that live bullets cannot be properly chambered. In the case where two chambers are provided seIective firing of the catridges therein can be achieved by employing a single trigger mechanism and wherein an initial movement will activate one firing pin mechanism and further movement will subsequently activate the second one. The barrels could be nore in number and could be rotatable about a finger, to provide a revolver type of arrangement. Bowever, such an arrangement will, in all likelihood, become too unwieldly if proper safety, combined with small comfortable size, is to be achieved. The endless band forming the finger ring or wrist strap may be made. rotatable so that the firearm can be concealed against the inside of the user 5 hand or wrist. Prior to cocking the gun, the ring orwrist strap can once more be rotated so that the barrels are on the outside of the fingers or wrist. It should be noted that in order to improve accuracy at greater distances of the projected bullet or missile the simple addition of an extension barrel which can be attached to the front end of a barrel or bore housing same is envisage. Where the chamber is axially movable the extension barrel and the barrel itself could be provided with co operating inter engaging fingers to provide for proper alignment of the barrel and barrel extension at the point of firing and for properly guiding a bullet along such extended barrel. Such extension barrel could be rifled if required. Also a sighting arrangement could be made to simply attach to the ring or other support member. A silencing or sound moderating device could also be screwed onto the barrels themselves or the extension barrels. The support body may be interchangeable with a piece of ornamental jeweilery on the endless band.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRWINGS In the drawings FIG. 1 illustrates, in isometric view, a finger ring embodying a firearm according to this inventionin the closed and inoperative position FIG. 2 illustrates, in similar view, the finger ring with the firearm in a cocked condition FIG. 3 is a section through the finger ring taken along the axis thereof and in the uncocked condition FIG. 4 is a view similar to Fig. 3 but with the finger ring in a cocked condition FIG. 5 is a cross section through the finger ring taken at right angles to the axis thereof FIG. 6 is a split sectional view taken along line VI VI in Fig. 5 FIG. 7 illustrates in isometric view the spring loaded catch arrangement for holding the firearm in a safe or firing condition and with the associated flash protector flap FIG. 8 illustrates, in exploded orthographic projection, a second embodiment of the invention and, FIG. 9 illustrates in isometric view the association of an extension barrel and an axially movable barrel.DETAILED DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWINGS Referring firstly to Figs. 1 to 7 the firearm, in the illustrated embodiment of the invention, assumes the form of d finger ring, generally indicated by the numeral 1, which defines the support of the firearm according to this invention. The ring has an axis 2 which, in use, is to coincide with the axis of a wearer s finger and has a body portion 3 of the firearm built up on the finger ring and shaped to form a bore 4 having its axis extending parallel to that of the finger ring. An axially novable barrel 5 is located in the bore to define.an annular space 6 between its outside surface and the inner surface of the bore and defines a chamber at its operatively inner or rear end. An outwardly directed flange 7 at said inner end is slidable on the surface of the bore. The barrel is guided, at its operatively forward end 8, by an inwardly direct ed flange formation 9, at the out let extremity of the bore.Thus, in the firing position in which the barrel is at its innermost position, it is supported at its front and rear ends by the flange 7 and flange formation 9 respectively. The annular space 6 accommodates a compression spring 10 for operating the firearm and a radially extending slide member 11 is secured to the barrel towards its flanged end 7. The slide member extends through a slot 12 in the side of the body portion of the support so as to be accessible by the thumb of a person wearing the ring. A suitable friction affording thumb engagement member 13 is provided on the slide. The slot 12 has an angularly extending recess 14 at its end nearer the outlet from the barrel. The above arrangement is such that the barrel 5 can be moved forwardly to compress the compression spring and the slide can be rotated somewhat angularly in order to engage it in the recess and hold the slide with the barrel in a cocked position. The gun is to be fired by simply moving the slide angularly with the thumb of the person wearing the ring to enable it to move rearwardly under the action of the spring. In order to effect firing of the firearm a firing pin 15 is set into a plug shaped breech block 16 which screw threadedly engages the end of the bore opposite the outlet end. The breech block is cup shaped with the inner diameter of the cup, which is defined by a skirt 17, aligning with that of the bore to form a continuation thereof. A deep notch 18 in the skirt 17 see Fig 7 is, in the firing position of the breech block, adapted to align with the slot through which the slide extends to enable the barrel to move rearwardly sufficiently far for a cartridge in the chamber to engage the firing pin 15 carried in the breech block. The firing pin 15 can be permanently fixed in the breech block or may be removable to provide for replacement thereof. In other angular positions of the breech block the slide is prevented from moving rearwardly to a sufficient extent that a cartridge in the chamber will contact the firing pin. All such positions correspond to a safe position even when the firearm is cocked as the slide will simply engage the end edge of the skirt prior to a cartridge engaging the firing pin. A click stop arrangement is provided to define the safe and firing angular positions of the breech block and, to this end, a spring loaded arrangement shown most clearly in Fig. 7 may be provided. Two notches 19 are provided at angularly spaced positions in the free end edge of the skirt with a catch member 20 spring biased by a spring 21 towards engagement therewith. In one position in which the catch member engages in a notch the deep recess aligns with the slot to define a firing position. In the other click stop position the end region of the slot is obscured by the skirt of the breech block to define the safe position. The spring 21 is located in a hole22 in the body which is.parallel to the bore 4 but located offset therefrom and nearer the finger ring axis 2. In order that the same spring 21 serves a dual purpose, its opposite end bears against a rider 23 in turn engaging a cam formation 24associated with a hinge 25 of a cover flap 26. The cover flap is hingedly attached to the front end of the firearm and is movable between two positions, one as illustrated in Fig. 1 in which the end of the barrel and bore are closed by the flap, and a second one in which the flap is pivoted downwardly to extend roughly parallel to the axis of the barrel, and in which it is located to protect 2 wearer s finger against flashing produced by the firing of a cartridge. The rider and cam surface are arranged to hold the flap member in either of these two terminal positions just described. In order to prepare the firearm for use the breech block is unscrewed entirely and a cartridge introduced into the chamber in which it is a light frictional fit. The breech block is replaced and either of the safe or firing positions can be chosen. Suitable indications are provided on the body of the firearm to show which position corresponds to which condition of the firearm. In order to operate the firearm the slide is simply moved forwardly against the spring loading of the chamber which automatically opens the flap.The slide is then rotated into the recess in the slot and the firearm is then ready to be fired. The thumb of a person wearing the firearm can simply be employed to release the slide with the friction affording thumb engagement member 13 being flicked upwardly. it will be understood that, with a finger ring of the above type located on a person s finger, and with the finger bent, the subcutaneous finger tissue expands to provide an extremely tight fit of the ring on a finger and, accordingly, enables the firearm to be aimed fairly accurately, at least sufficiently accurately for reasonably close combat situations. During firing the flap acts as a flash protector against burning by the burnt powder of a cartridge. Numerous variations may be made to the above described embodiment of the invention In particular the design of the support and, indeed, the breech block may be varied widely. Thus, with reference to Fig. 8, there is provided a breech block 27 which slides onto the support 28 laterally and simply locks in position by any suitable catch means or a screw threaded device. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 8 two longitudinally movable barrels 29 are provided, each of which may be cocked independently of the other but which can be linked to the same firing mechanism so that they could be fired sequentially if required. Each barrel 29 has a flanged end as described above with a radially extending slide 30 co operating with one of two parallel slots 31 therefor in the top face 32 of the support. The slides are, in this case, simply in the form of short pins and each slot has a transverse retaining recess 33 at its end remote from the breech block for holding its associated barrel in a cocked condition. An operating cum trigger member 34 is provided on the support 28 to cover the top face 32 thereof and to be slidable both longitudinally relative to the barrels and transversely to a small extent The operating member can also serve to retain the breech block in position where the latter slides on laterally from the top surface 32 of the support 28. The operating member has two slots 35 and 36 therein corresponding to the slots 31 in the support but wherein the one 36 is appreciably wider than the other 35. The narrower one 35 has a recess 37 at its end nearer the breech block. The operating. member acts as follows with the barrels in the uncocked condition the operating member is slid forwardly to compress both springs 38 for the barrels and to move them to their cocked positions. When the slides are opposite the retaining recesses the operating member is moved laterally to move the slides into their retaining recesses 33 thereby holding them in a cocked condition. The operating member is then slid back to its position in which its slots coincide with those in the support. Conveniently it may be spring biased in both directions to this latter position. To fire the barrels successively the operating member is pushed laterally with the thumb until the slide 30 associated with the narrower slot 35 in the operating member is released from its retaining recess. That barrel will then fire.Further lateral movement causes the slide associated with the wider slot 36 to be released from its retaining recess and its barrel to fire. This further lateral movement is accommodated by the first slide moving into the recess 37 in the narrower slot 35. Furthermore, a finger ring device may be made to accommodate two or more fingers of a wearer and, the chamber need not be movable within the firearm but a more conventional type of arrangement could be employed. Also, with rim firing cartridges, the firing pin could even be formed on the rear end of the chamber to co operate with a rim of a cartridge located therein. Turning now to Fig. 9 of the drawings there is illustrated a chamber 39 having finger like longitudinally extending formations 40 on the outer periphery thereof which co operate with spline like complementary formations 41 on the inner surface of an extension barrel 42. The extension barrel can, accordingly, be fixed relative to an associated support or body whilst the chamber is axially slidable therein. The co operating formations thus allow for relative longitudinal movement of the chamber to enable the firearm to operate on the above described principle.
