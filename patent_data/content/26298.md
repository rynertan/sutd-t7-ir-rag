## Description
PHENYLETHANOLAMINE DERIVATIVES AND ACID ADDITION SETS THEREOF USEFUL AS GROWTH PROMOTERS AND REDUCTION OF FAT IN FARM AND COMPANION ANIMALS Substitution products of certain l aminodihalo phenyl 2 aminoethanes and the acid addition salts thereof are disclosed in United States Patent 3,536,712, issued on October 2 7, 1970. Specifically, patentees disclose methods for the synthesis of said compounds and state that said compounds are useful for enhancing the blood circulation, and as bronchodilators, analgesies, sedatives, antipyretics, antiphiogistics and antitussives in warm blooded animals.Patentees, however, exemplify only the analgesic utility.They do not indicate or suggest that said compounds are useful for lowering the deposition of fat or increasing the growth rate in worm blooded animals, particularly farm and domestic animals, such as swine, poultry, dogs, sheep, goats, cats or cattle. It has now been found that the growth rate and the depression of fat deposition of meat producing animals such as swine, chickens, turkeys, domestic pets, rabbits, sheep, goats and cattle, including calves, can be increased and the efficiency of feed utilization thereby measurably improved by the oral or parenteral administration to said animals of an effective amount of a compound having the structure EMI1.1 wherein X is hydrogen or halogen fluorine, chlorine, iodine or bromine, but preferably chlorine or bromine Y is hydrogenNH2 or NHCOR5 Z is H, halogen fluorine, chlorine, iodine or bromine, but preferably chlorine or bromine or OH R1 is hydrogen or C1 C4 alkyl R2 is hydrogen, C1 C4 alkyl straight or branched chain or C2 C4 alkenyl R3 is hydrogen, Cl C6 alkyl straight or branched chain , C3 C6 cycloalkyl, methoxypropyl, C2 C5 alkenyl, phenyl, 2 hyroxy ethyl, a,Ã…a dimethylphenethyl or benzyl and when R2 and R3 are taken together with the nitrogen to which they are attached, they may represent morpholino or N C1 C4 alkylpiperazino R4 is hydrogen, hydroxyl or OR6 R5 is hydrogen or Cl C4 alkyl R6 is Cl C6 alkyl with the provisos that when R3 is phenyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, a,a dimethylphenethyl, cycloalkyl C3 C6, benzyl or methoxypropyl, R2 is hydrogen and when Z is OH, X and Y are hydrogen and when Y is NHCOR5, at least one of X and Z is hydrogen and provided also that at least one of X,Y and Z represents a substituent other than hydrogen racemic mixtures of the above identified compounds and the optically active isomers and non toxic, pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Preferred compounds for use in the method of this invention have the above structure wherein X and Z are each chlorine or bromine Y is hydrogen or NH2 R1 is hydrogen orC1 C4 alkyl R4 is hydroxyl or a non toxic, pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. The most preferred compounds for use in enhancing the growth rate of meat producing animals and for improving the efficiency of feed utilization thereby are 4 amino a tert butylamino methyl 3 ,5 dichlorobenzyl alcohol hydrochloride 4 amino 3,5 dibromo alpha diisopropylamino methyl benzyl alcohol hydrochloride 4 amino 3,5 dichloro a di isopropylamino methyl benzyl alcohol hydrochloride 4 amino 3,5 dibromo a tert butylamino methyl benzyl alcohol hydrochloride 4 amino 3, 5 dichloro a methylamino methyl benzyl alcohol hydrochloride 4 amino 3,5 dichloro a allyl amino methylibenzyl alcohol 4 amino 3 bromo a 1 tert butylamino methyl 5 chlorobenzyl alcohol hydrochloride a 14 amino 3,5 dichlorophenyl 4 morpholineethanol hydrochloride 4 amino 3 bromo alpha tert butylamino methyl 5 chlorobenzyl alcohol hydrochloride and a tert butylamino methyl 3,5 dichlorobenzyl alcohol hydrochloride. It is found, that formula I compounds below wherein Y is hydrogen can be prepared by the condensation of an appropriately substituted sytrene oxide with the appropriately substituted amine in the presence of an inert solvent, such as a lower alcohol at or near the boiling point of same, as shown below EMI3.1 tb SEP x tb SEP R tb SEP o7 SEP 2 SEP ethanol tb SEP 0 SEP a tb SEP z tb EMI3.2 wherein X and Z are halogen, R2 and R3 are as hereinabove defined and Y is hydrogen.Thus, 3,5 dichlorostyrene oxide can be reacted with an equimolar or molar excess of t butylamine in ethanol at reflux from about 1 to about 8 hours, or until the reaction is essentially complete and the desired a t butylamino methyl 3,5 dichlorobenzyl alcohol is obtained as illustrated below EMI3.3 The thus obtained product can be purified by known procedures, such as chromatography or recrystallization of salt thereof. action., The thus obtained halo compound is isolated by conventional laboratory methods and is then reacted with the appropriate alcohol, under an inert blanket of gas, such as nitrogen at a temperature range of from about 0 to 54C. Thus thus obtained formula I product is then isolated by standard laboratory methods and purified, if so desired. The above reaction sequence may be graphically illustrated as follows EMI4.1 wherein X,Y.Z,R2,R3 and R6 are as hereinabove defined. Alternatively, a formula I compound whereinR4 is OR6 may be prepared by dissolving the corresponding formula I compound wherein R4 is OH in the corresponding R6OH alcohol and saturating the thus obtained solution with dry HCl gas. The reaction mixture is then stirred at room temperature for a period of time sufficient to essentially complete the reaction and the product is then isolated by standard laboratory procedures and purified, if so desired.

Since the effective and preferred dietary levels of the active ingredient vary somewhat from species to species in the above mentioned animals said levels for each animal species are listed in Table I below on a gram per ton of feed basis Table IEMI6.1 tb SEP Effective SEP Preferred tb SEP Feed SEP Level SEP Level tb SEP Compound SEP g ton SEP g ton SEP Animal tb Formula SEP I SEP 0.1 300 SEP 1 200 SEP Swine tb SEP 0.1 200 SEP 1 100 SEP Sheep, SEP Goats tb SEP 0.01 50 SEP 0.1 10 SEP Chickens, SEP Rabbits tb SEP 0.01 50 SEP 0.1 10 SEP Turkeys tb SEP 0.1 200 SEP 1 100 SEP Cattle tb Animal feed compositions which wiU provide the desired growth promotion and feed efficiency in the above mentioned animals can be prepared by admixing the phenylethanolamine derivative or acid addition salt thereof, or an animal feed supplement containing said compound, with a sufficient quantity of an appropriate animal feed to provide the desired level of active compound in said feed. Animal feed supplements can be prepared by admix ing about 75 to 95 by weight of the phenylethanolamine derivative or acid addition salt thereof, with about 5 to 25 by weight of a suitable carrier or diluent. Carriers suitable for use to make up the feed supplement compositions include the following alfalfa meal, soybean meal, cotton seed oil meal, linseed oil meal, sodium chloride, cornmeal, cane molasses, urea, bone meal, corncob meal and the like. The carrier promotes a uniform distribution of the active ingredient in the finished feed into which the supplement is blended. It thus performs an important function by ensur ing proper distrubition of the active ingredient throughout the feed. If the supplement is used as a top dressing for feed, it likewise helps to ensure uniformity of distribution of the active material across the top of the dressed feed. For parenteral administration the phenylethanol amine derivative may be prepared in the form of a paste or pellet and administered as an implant, usually under the skin of the heat or ear of the animal in which enhanced growth rate and or improved efficiency of feed utilization is sought. In practive, parenteral administration generally involved injection of a sufficient amount of the above said ethane derivative to provide the animal with from 0.001 to 100 mg kg of body weight of the active ingredient. The preferred dosage level for swine is 0.01 to 50 mg kg of body weight and for cattle the range of from 0.001 to 50 mg kg of body weight of the active phenylethanolamine derivative is preferred. The preferred dose level of said ethane derivative for poultry is about 0.001 to 35 mg kg of animal body weight and the preferred dose level of said ethanol derivative for sheep and goats is 0.001 to 40 mg kg of animal body weight. The preferred dose level for rabbits and domestic pets is 0.001 to 35 mg kg of animal body weight. Paste formulations can be prepared by dispersing the active ethanol derivative in a pharmaceutically acceptable oil such as peanut oil, sesame oil, corn oil or the like. Pellets containing an effective level of the phenylethanolamine derivative can be prepared by admixing the above said active ingredient with a diluent such as carbowax, biodegradable polymers, carnuba wax, or the like. A lubricant, such as magnesium stearate or calcium stearate may be added to improve the pelleting process if desired. It is, of course, recognized that more than one pellet may be administered to an animal to achieve the desired dose level which will provide the increased growth rate and or improved efficiency of feed utilization by said animal. Moreover, it has been found that additional implants may also be introduced periodically during the treatment period in order to maintain the proper drug release rate in the animal s body. In addition to enhanced growth promotion and improved efficiency of feed utilization by meat producing animals, the compounds of the present invention have the add ed advantage that,. at selected levels of administration they depress the deposition of fat in said animals. This biological response has substantial advantage to poultrymen and swine producers since administration of said compounds at selected levels yields leaner animals which command premium prices from the meat industry. The invention has several advantages for the pet owner or veterinarian who wishes to trim unwanted fat from pet animals. For poultry men and swine raisers, using the method of the present invention were attained increased yields of leaner animals which command higher prices from the meat industry. Surprisingly, it is also noted that feed efficiency and animal growth rate are significantly enhanced when the compounds of the present invention are administered to swine and poultry at selected dose levels. The fpllowing examples illustrate the invention. Example 1Evaluation of test compounds as animal growth promoters CFl female mice from Carworth Farms are received when they are six weeks old.

After evaporating to dryness the beaker containing fat is reweighed to determine grams of fat per five grams of homogenate.Total body fat in the carcass is calculated as follows EMI27.1 tb SEP grams SEP fat SEP grams SEP total SEP tb SEP in SEP sample SEP homogenate tb SEP Fat SEP SEP SEP x SEP 100 tb SEP r SEP gram SEP weightn SEP r SEP carcass SEP weight tb SEP of SEP sample SEP J SEP SEP l SEP SEP or SEP SEP mice SEP g tb Example 5Antilipogenic Evaluation of test compounds Mouse Study CFI female mice, 55 days old, are weighed in groups of 10 and allotted to cages to minimize weight variation among cages. Treatments are randomly assigned to cages. Each of the treatments are tested in 3 replicates, i.e., in 3 cages of 10 mice each. There are 10 cages of 10 control mice each. Durgs are mixed in the diet at the dosage level indicated. Feed and water are offered ad libitum for the 12 day test period. Feed spilled is collected during the test period. At the end of the test period, the collected feed is weighed and the mean feed consumption per cage of ten mice is determined for each treatment. The mice are weighed as a group of 10 and the weight gain determined. The mice are sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The right uterine fat pad of each mouse is removed. The fat pads for each cage of 10 mice are weighed as a unit. To establish correlation between the percent reduction in fat pad weights of treated animals and percent reduction in total body fat of treated animals, animals from several treatment groups are evaluated for total body fat using the body fat determination described in Example 5.Data obtained are reported in Table VII for those groups upon which such determination has been made. From percent reduction in fat pad weight and the total fat determinations for the groups tested, it can be seen that a reduction in fat pad weights of animals is generally indicative of a reduction of total body fat of the treated animals.
