## Description
The present invention relates to an intermittent type swirl injection nozzle for an internal combustion engine according to the preamble of claim 1. A swirl injection nozzle of said type is disclosed in DE B 1 086 948. In this known injection nozzle, the swirl passage is provided by swirl channels formed on the outside of the needle valve and the straight passage is provided by an another passage surrounding said channels. US A 4 179 069 describes an electromagnetically operated injection valve using longitudinal and circular fuel paths which do not supply the swirl chamber directly. With these arrangements it is not possible to adapt the spray characteristics to a sufficient extent to the requirements of stratified charge engines and Diesel engines. In such engines the fuel injection system has to meet increasingly stringent requirements of combustion efficiency and performance. To achieve the best performance of an engine over a wide range of operating conditions relative to engine speed and loads, there is required a fuel injection system which is adaptable for all operating conditions. A fuel injection system for a Diesel engine includes as primary components a fuel pump, connecting pipes and fuel injection nozzles. Of these, it is well known that the spray characteristics of the fuel injection nozzle particularly strongly affects the performance of the engine. The atomized fuel discharged from the fuel injection system into the combustion chamber can be made to form an optimum fuel air mixture provided that the particle size of the spray , the angle of divergence spray angle , the penetration of the spray, the required fuel quantity for each injection, and the like, are properly determined in accordance with the flow rate of the air taken into the combustion chamber. Moreover, adaptation of injection timing, injection period and coefficient of intake air utilization, are important to improve the thermal efficiency of the engine and to suppress the generation of smoke. In order to satisfy the requirements above, it has been attempted to increase the injection pressure of the fuel, make the diameter of the nozzle hole as small as possible, and provide a plurality of nozzle holes. Moreover, attempts have been taken to redesign the shapes of the pintle and the throttle valve and implement the valve lift control, including adopting a plurality of injection nozzles. However, with the use of conventional swirl type injection nozzles, it is not always possible to ensure satisfactory fuel atomization, the desired angle of spray divergence, and the desired penetration of fuel particles. In addition, such a conventional injection nozzle is complicated in construction and is expensive. Taking the above described circumstances into account, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an intermittent type swirl injection nozzle capable of providing a desired spray particle size, a desired angle of spray divergence, and a desired penetration of the spray, wherein each of these factors can be controlled in accordance with various internal combustion engine operating conditions. This object is solved with the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to Claim 1. Further advantageous features of this intermittent type swirl injection nozzle are evident from the subclaims. In the inventive injection nozzle the straight flow passage and the swirl flow passage are partitioned and not interfering with one another until they meet in the swirl chamber. After being joined, the two fuel sprays are sprayed in conical form through the spray hole. Before, each of the flow passages can easily be adjusted in order to give an optimal spray characteristics. This spray characteristics is further improved by providing for certain relations between the effective flow areas of said swirl and straight passages and of said spray hole, thus providing a desired angle of spray divergence, penetration reach of spray, and fuel atomization. With the inventive swirl injection nozzle, desired spray characteristics are obtained by making the fuel flows energized in the swirl and straight directions fit for the adaptive flow rate. These characteristics including the angle of divergence, the degree of atomization, and the penetration of the fuel spray, are affected by the way in which the respective passages are formed. To date, in a swirl injection nozzle, there have been no known studies relating to the swirl and straight flow influences to the spray. More specifically, the inventors have conducted detailed investigations of the aforementioned problems and succeeded in providing a swirl injection nozzle based on a unique concept of providing passages designed to meet a wide range of engine requirements. With reference to the earlier national applications DE A 3 432,663 and the corresponding GB A 2 148 387, the applicant has submitted separate claims for DE and GB. Given that the flow rate of the fuel injected from the spray hole is expressed by Q₃, the flow rates of the fuel flowing through the straight and swirl passages respectively by Q₂ and Q₁, the fuel pressure in the swirl chamber by P₂ and fuel pressure at the valve inlet by P₁, the relation between the flow rates and pressures is represented by the following equation Given that, in the swirl passage, the straight passage, and the passage of the spray hole that K₁ K₃ and K₂ 0 or K₁ K₂ 1 2K₃, etc. , K₁ K₂ K₃ 1, according to the equation above, P₂ P₁ is equal to 0. That is, due to the resistance in the swirl and straight passages, the fuel injection pressure P₂ is half the oil pressure P₁ applied by the pump. In other words, the oil pressure applied by the pump has to be more than twice as high as the valve opening pressure required to lift the needle nozzle. Consequently, the amplified oil pressure tends to increase the deficiency of the injection system as a whole. As the resistance in the swirl and straight passages increases, the rise of pressure P₂ is weakened, and when such weakened pressure rise affects the lifting of the needle valve further, the needle valve will be lifted unsatisfactorily or the movement of the needle valve may become unstable, causing normal spraying to be impossible. As K₁ K₂ increases relative to K₃, P₂ P₁ approaches 1, and thus the difference in pressure between the front and rear of the swirl and straight passages P₁ P₂ is decreased and hence the flow velocity of the fuel passing through the passages reduced. Accordingly, the swirling energy of the fuel passing through the swirl passage will be reduced, making it impossible to achieve the desired characteristics of the swirl injection nozzle. Thus, there exists an optimum range of K₁ K₂ K₃. As an intermittent type swirl injection valve applicable to various internal combustion engines, the lead angles ϑ₁ of swirl passages K₁, K₁ K₂ K₃, K₁ K₂ and K₁ should be properly selected in combination so as to provide a swirl injection nozzle having optimum characteristics for various types of internal combustion engines in terms of angle of spray divergence, penetration of the spray, and spray particle diameter. Moreover, to be applicable as a swirl injection nozzle for various internal combustion engines, for instance, small direct injection Diesel engines used over a wide operating range for small motor vehicles, K₁, K₂ and K₃ expressed by the cross sectional areas of the respective passage , have to satisfy at least one of the following conditions. That is, results obtained from a number of experiments and analyses have proved that at least one of the following range requirements should be satisfied K₁ K₂ K₃ should be within a range of 1 to 5, K₁ K₂ within a range of 0.2 to 2 with a value of 1 preferred, and the angle ϑ₁ of the swirl passage of K₁ should be within a range of 5 to 60 . However, these optimum ranges may differ in some cases, for instance, for a large stationary nonvehicular Diesel engine whose operating range of r.p.m. is narrow. The straight passage is provided between the needle valve and the inner wall of the nozzle body. Although the straight and swirl flows have been defined as being flows directed downstream through the straight and swirl passages, respectively, the energies of the straight and swirl flows are subject to variations depending on the flow direction, provided that, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, the fuel passage is allowed to communicate with the lower reach of the body seat termed the swirl chamber close to the leading end of the valve needle in the tangential direction relative to the valve axis and is offset therefrom. Even in this case, the fuel passage is a straight passage capable of providing the swirl energy according to the present invention. Accordingly, the passages are arranged in consideration of both the energies imparted thereto. The intermittent type swirl injection nozzle thus constructed according to the present invention operates to create one flow energized in the swirl direction and the other energized in the straight direction which are adapted by the passages formed in the aforementioned manner so that fuel flows passed through the swirl and straight passages and joined together can be sprayed in a conical shape from the spray hole to obtain the desired spray characteristics. Moreover, the fuel passage is made to communicate with the lower reach of the body seat close to the leading end of the needle valve in the tangential direction with respect to the valve axis, and the straight to swirl energy convergence ratio is determined by properly selecting the tangential direction, whereby the fuel is sprayed from the spray hole in such a manner as to obtain the desired spray characteristics. Thus the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention is capable of providing the desired spray characteristics, including the angle of spray divergence, the reach of the spray, and the degree of atomization corresponding to specified internal combustion engine operating conditions. As a result, the fuel, sprayed in a generally conical form from the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention, together with the intake air flow, is adaptable to pre determined combustion chambers of various engines, and provides an excellent fuel air mixture under a wide range of operating conditions. Accordingly, because the improved fuel spray contributes to more effective combustion, not only is there an improvement in engine output, but also reductions in the discharged smoke generation level and the fuel consumption rate, the generation of toxic components in the exhaust gas, and combustion noise. Fig. 1 is a graph representing the characteristics of an intermittent type swirl injection nozzle embodying the present invention Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional cutaway view showing principal portions of a first embodiment of an intermittent swirl injection nozzle of the present invention Figs. 3 and 4 are vertical sectional cutaway and transverse sectional views, respectively, of principal portions of a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring now to the drawings, preferred embodiments of the present invention will subsequently be described. Fig. 2 shows a first embodiment of an intermittent type swirl injection nozzle constructed according to the present invention. This intermittent type swirl injection nozzle A has a fixed cylindrical member 4 provided between the inner wall 2 of a nozzle body 1 and the outer periphery of a needle valve 3, the cylindrical member 4 being fixed to the inner wall 2 and being provided with a tangential groove 5 at its outer surface. A guide hole 6 of the cylindrical member 4 slidably receives the valve needle 3. A coil spring not shown resiliently presses against the base end rear face of the valve needle 3. A conical body seat 8 with which the conical end 7 of the valve needle 3 can contact is provided at the forward end of the inner wall 2. A spray hole 9 having a predetermined flow area K₃ is provided at the leading end of the nozzle body 1. The nozzle body 1 forms an annular swirl chamber 10 located around and close to the boundary between the cylindrical body and the conical forward end of the valve needle 3. The leading end of a supply passage 11 formed in the nozzle body 1 communicates with the swirl chamber 10 through at least one tangential groove 5, which acts as a swirl passage provided in the outer peripheral face of the swirl chamber 10, extending in its tangential direction, and having a flow area K₁. With this structure, fuel is sufficiently energized in the swirl direction when passing through the tangential groove 5, whereby intense swirls are formed therein. In this first embodiment, the needle valve 3 is lifted from the body seat 8 when urged against the above mentioned coil spring to allow the valve to open with a rise in the pressure of the fuel supplied to the swirl chamber 10 through the fuel supply passage 11 and the tangential groove 5, whereupon the swirl chamber 10 in the fuel passage is caused to communicate with the spray hole 9 through the gap between the forward end 7 of the needle valve 3 and the body seat 8. In addition, the injection valve A has a straight passage 13 provided between the lower outer peripheral wall 12 of the valve needle 3 and the guide hole 6 of the cylindrical member 4, extending in the axial direction of the needle valve 3, and having a flow area K₂. Consequently, the fuel is energized generally in the straight direction, that is, in the axial direction of the needle valve 3, in the straight passage 13. The injection nozzle A according to the first embodiment is arranged so that a generally conical spray of fuel exiting from the spray hole 9 has desired spray characteristics in view of the fact that fuel flows are energized in the tangential groove 5 and the straight passage 13 in the swirl and straight directions, respectively, and then joined in the swirl chamber 10. It is assumed that Q₃ designates the fuel flow rate of fuel injected from the spray hole 9 Q₂, the flow rate of the fuel flowing through the straight passage 13 Q₁, the flow rate of the fuel flowing through the tangential groove 5 P₁, the fuel pressure at the valve inlet supply oil pressure and P₂, the fuel pressure in the swirl chamber 10. In the case of the first embodiment of the invention, assuming that the conditions discussed above meet K₁ K₃ and K₂ 2K₃, then P₂ P₁, K₁ K₂ K₃ and K₁ K₂ are 0.9, 3 and 0.5, respectively. Furthermore, when the angle ϑ₁ of the tangential groove 5 is 10 , the values above will be within the desired ranges of K₁ K₂ K₃, K₁ K₂ and ϑ₁. Thus, in the first embodiment of the swirl injection nozzle A thus constructed, the fuel is energized by the tangential groove 5 in the swirl direction and joined to the fuel flow energized in the straight direction from the straight passage, and the joined flow is sprayed from the spray hole 9 and atomized to form a conical spray. Accordingly, the first embodiment of the injection nozzle A is capable of producing a large spray angle and excellent atomizing characteristics and short penetration as compared with a hole or throttle type nozzle. In the above described first embodiment, since the tangential groove 5 and the straight passage 13 are formed in respective different independent portions and the flows are prevented from interfering with each other, the spray characteristics are such that, even if the pump pressure is raised as the pump speed increases, there will occur few change in the angle of divergence of the spray which varies with the angle of the tangential groove 5 relative to the axis of the needle valve . By using such an intermittent type swirl injection nozzle in an internal combustion engine, significant improvements of the performance of the engine are attained. In the second embodiment of the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle of the invention, according to Figs. 3 4, by properly selecting the tangential angle ϑ₂ of the outer peripheral face of the swirl chamber 48 relative to the axis of the tangential port 45, the fuel flow from the tangential port 45 in the direction Again, referring to Figs. 3 4, the second embodiment of the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle of the invention will be described. The second embodiment of the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle D is provided with a fixed cylindrical member 44, disposed between the inner wall 42 of a nozzle body 41 and a needle valve 43, and at least one notch shaped tangential groove 45, having a flow area L, at the lower end of the cylindrical member 44. There is also provided a guide hole 46 for slidably guiding the needle valve 43 in the cylindrical member 44 together with an annular straight passage 47 defined between the outer periphery of the needle valve 43 and the inner wall of the guide hole 46. Fuel supply passages 40 communicating with a fuel supply source not shown through fuel supply passages 11 is provided between the inner wall 42 of the nozzle body 41 and the outer peripheral wall of the cylindrical member 44. The rear portion of each fuel supply passage 40 is tilted relative to the axis of the needle valve 43, at a tangential angle of ϑ₂ relative to the outer peripheral face of a swirl chamber 48, and communicates with the tangential groove 45 for energizing the fuel flows around the axis of the valve needle 43 in both the swirl and straight directions. In this second embodiment, the tangential angle ϑ₂ relative to the outer peripheral face of the swirl chamber 48 should be properly selected and determined. In doing so, the existence of the flow in the straight direction via the passage 47 must be taken into consideration. Accordingly, ϑ₂ in this case will be relatively large. The effects of the swirl injection nozzles of the invention will now be further described in detail. In the conventional swirl injection nozzle, the swirl flow has been considered only with regard to energization of the fuel flow in the swirl direction. Such a simple concept is, however, insufficient to achieve satisfactory control over the angle of divergence of the spray, the degree of atomization and the penetration of the spray. However, in the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention, based on the hitherto undiscovered facts that a combination of flows energized in the swirl and straight directions exerts an advantageous influence upon the spray characteristics of the nozzle and that such fuel flows can be created by the choice of construction of the passages, difficulties attributed to the atomization of fuel are effectively obviated by an extremely simple expedient. Specifically, the effects of the invention include the following As set forth above in detail, the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention attains desired spray characteristics simply by appropriate determination of the construction of the fuel passages. The intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention is simple in construction, readily installed, and thus less costly. The structure of the conventional nozzle body need not be modified it is only necessary to add another cylindrical member to the structure of the conventional nozzle. The conventional small injection nozzle for direct injection Diesel engine requires plural spray holes, each being 0.3 mm The intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention is particularly effective for engines of compact motor vehicle and industrial and multipurpose direct injection Diesel engines, but may be applied as well to large size Diesel engines. An injection nozzle is normally installed close to the center of the cylinder bore and must be arranged close to the intake and exhaust valves. When the swirl injection nozzle according to the Present invention is applied, because the nozzle body is small and its external diameter can be minimized typically only about 7 mm Furthermore, plural nozzles of this invention can be employed when higher air utilization is needed for the effective combustion of the engine. Even in this case, it is ensured that far more efficient and effective combustion can be attained than in the case of a high pressure multi hole spray nozzle. With the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention, any multi purpose fuel pump operating at normal pressures valve opening pressure 120 to 180 kg cm² can be employed, due primarily to the different spray generation mechanism used by the invention. Moreover, because the arrangement of the swirl and straight passages and the spray hole are taken into account, not only is excellent atomization of the fuel attained at normal pressures, but also good penetration of the spray is made possible. Also, fuel leakage from the connecting pipes and cracking thereof attributed to pressures exceeding 250 kg cm² and peak pressures ranging from 500 to 700 kg cm² or more , damage to the pipes due to erosion and noise derived from vibration and the like are eliminated. As a result, the overall injection system, including the pump, can be provided at a lower cost while attaining extremely high reliability and durability. With the injection nozzle according to the present invention, various kinds of fuel are usable. Diesel oil having low petane values and wide cut low setane oil can be used due to the advantageous spray characteristics of the injection nozzle of the present invention. It is highly probable, moreover, that low grade diesel oil, diesel oil blended with heavy oil diesel oil blended with alcohol, vegetable fuel oil, and the like are usable for Diesel engines when the injection nozzle of the present invention is employed. Thus, the present invention makes a significant contribution to the conservation of energy. With the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention, satisfactory high speed operation is possible. A conventional swirl injection nozzle is normally capable of better performance than other types injection nozzles for low engine speed ranges but is accompanied by other problems due to the required high pump pressure. However, by arranging swirl and straight passages independent of each other, the flow energized in the swirl direction hardly affects the fuel flow energization in the straight direction during high speed, high pressure operations, thus preventing the spray angle from being undesirably increased. In other words, stable and quiet combustion is provided in the low speed range because a good swirl flow is produced, whereas a higher rate of air utilization makes possible excellent performance of the engine in the high speed range. A number of advantageous effects and characteristics of the intermittent type swirl injection nozzle according to the present invention have so far been discussed. However, still other advantageous effects, which have been sought for several decades, are attained with the invention, including improved atomizing characteristics of fuel supplied to a Diesel engine. Still further, reductions in combustion noise and the production of harmful exhaust substances has also been achieved.
