## Description
ULTRAVIOLET RESISTANT THERMOPLASTIC POLYURETHANES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Thermoplastic polyurethanes having a wide range of physical properties are known that have many applications. A particularly valuable class of these polyurethanes are prepared from higher molecular weight polyols and low molecular or short chain diols reacted with aromatic diisocyanates such as naphthalene 1,5 diisocyanate, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, p phenylene diisocyanate, and the like.While polyurethanes so made have many excellent physical properties, these aromatic diisocyanates are expensive and the resulting polyurethanes do not have the desired degree of resistance to attack and discoloration by ultraviolet radiation for many applications. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Novel and improved thermoplastic polyurethanes having an excellent balance of physical properties and improved resistance to ultraviolet degradation and discolorations are prepared by reacting together a macropolyol including hydroxyl terminated polyesters, polyethers and polycarbonates, a diol such as the glycols containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms, and p tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The thermoplastic polyurethanes are readily prepared from a variety of compounds having terminal functional groups reactive with the isocyanates, including hydroxyl terminated polyesters, polylactones, polyethers, polycarbonates, polyhydrocarbons, polyepihalohydrins and the like. Normally used are hydroxylterminated compounds having molecular weights greater than about 300 to 400 to 10,000. The most commonly used compounds or macropolyols are hydroxyl terminated polyesters, polyethers, polyacetals, poly carbonates, polyepihalohydrins, polybutadienes and polyacrylates, alone or in admixture, having molecular weights greater than about 400, with polyfunctional chain extenders such as the diols.Useful materials are obtained from mixtures of a macroglycol and a small polyfunctional polyol chain extender such as an alkylene glycol or ether glycol, a cycloaliphatic glycol, or an aromaticaliphatic glycol, and the like. In the so called prepolymer technique an excess of organic diisocyanate is first reacted with the marcoglycol and unsaturated polyester or polyether and then the small difunctional chain extender added, normally in amounts equivalent to react with substantially all of the free isocyanate group. The hydroxyl polyalkylene oxide , or polyether macroglycols, preferably are essentially linear hydroxyl terminated compounds having ether linkages as the major linkage joining carbon atoms. The molecular weights may vary between about 400 and 10,000, usually to about 2,000. The hydroxyl polyalkylene oxide s as hydroxyl poly tetramethylene oxide , hydroxyl poly trimethylene oxide , hydroxyl poly hexamethylene oxide , hydroxyl poly ethylene oxide and the like of the formula HO CH2 nO XH wherein n is a number from 2 to 6 and x is an integer, and alkyl substituted types such as hydroxyl poly l,2 propylene oxide tetrahydrofuran and ethylene oxide co polyethers and the like. The polyester glycols include linear hydroxyl terminated polyesters having molecular weights between about 400 and 10,000, usually about 2,000. The polyesters utilized include those prepared by the polyesterification of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids including, for example, malonic, adipic, succinic, pimelic, suberic, azelic, sebacic and the like or their anhydrides. Aromatic dicarboxylic acids of the formulaHOOC R COOH where R is an alkylene radical containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 6 carbon atoms.The phthalic acids are also useful. The glycols used in the preparation of the polyesters by reaction with the dicarboxylic acids are normally aliphatic polyols containing between 2 and 10 carbon atoms, usually 2 to 6 carbon atoms, such as ethylene glycol, propanediol, butanediol, hexamethylene glycol, decamethylene glycol, 2 ethylhexanediol 1,6, neopentyl glycol and the like 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and aromatic polyols or bis 1,4 8 hydroxyethoxy benzene. Poly esteramides also are contemplated, usually obtained by substitution of a diamine or amino alcohol for at least part of the glycol. Poly epsilon caprolactone diols are the polyester reaction products of epsilon caprolactones whose polymerization has been initiated by bifunctional compounds having two active hydrogen sites that are capable of opening the lactone ring and initiating polymerization of the lactone. These bifunctional materials may be represented by the formula HX R XH whereinR is an organic radical which can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic and X is O, NH andNR where R is a hydrocarbon radical which can be alkyl, aryl, aralkyl and cycloalkyl. Such materials include diols, diamines and aminoalcohols preferably. Useful diols include alkylene glycols wherein the alkylene group contains 2 to 10 carbon atoms for example, ethylene glycol, 1,2 propane diol, butanediol 1,4, hexamethylene glycol and the like. Ethylene glycol provides excellent polyesters. The lactones preferred for preparing the polyesters are epsilon caprolactones having the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein at least 6 of the R s are hydrogen and the remainder are hydrogen or alkyl groups containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably methyl. Mixtures of lactones may be employed to form the polyesters as epsiloncaprolactone and trimethyl epsilon caprolactone, OC methyl epsilon caprolactone, methyl epsiloncaprolactone, di methyl epsilon caprolactone, and the like. The lactones are polymerized readily be heating with the bifunctional reactant to a temperature of about 100 to about 2000C. Catalysts may be employed if desired. Particularly preferred are poly epsilon caprolactone diols having molecular weights in the range of about 400 to about 10,000, normally to about 2,000. Polyacetals are generally prepared by the reaction of an aldehyde and a polyhydric alcohol with an excess of the alcohol, including for example, reaction products of aldehydes such as formaldehyde, paraldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, acrolein and the like reacted with glycols for example, ethyl ene glycol, hexanediol, diethylene glycol and the like which are well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the polyacetals may be considered to be reaction products of aldehydes and glycols. The molecular weights of the polyacetal will be varied from about 400 to 10,000, normally about 2,000. Typical polyhydrocarbonurethanes useful in the practice of the invention will include hydroxylterminated liquid polymers having an aliphatic polymeric backbone prepared by polymerizing at least one vinylidene monomer having at least one terminal CH2 group per monomer molecule together with at least one hydroxyl containing disulfide as is described in U.S. Patent 4,120,766. Such liquid polymers may have a backbone derived from, for example, ethylene, isobutylene, butadiene, acrylate and methacrylate esters alone or with other vinylidene monomers such as styrene or acrylonitrile as is described in the aforementioned patent. Other methods for making hydroxyl containing liquid polymers are well known such as reacting an aminoalcohol with a liquid carboxyl terminated polymer having backbones of the type disclosed above. The molecular weight of these materials will range from about 400 to 5,000. The polycarbonate glycols include reaction products of polyols and phosgene or organic carbonate compounds. Of the polyols, poly oxyalkylene glycol s may have the general formula HO R O XH wherein R is an alkylene radical containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms and x is an integer, typically from 1 to 5. The alkylene glycols normally contain 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Typical materials include, for example, ethylene glycol, 1,4butanediol, 1,6 hexanediol, diethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 2 ethyl 1,6 hexanediol, 1,5 pentanediol, 1,4 cyclohexanediol, 1,2,6hexanetriol, polyoxyethylene glycols and triols, polyoxypropylene glycols and the like. The organic carbonates may have the formulaEMI6.1 wherein the R s are alkyl radical containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and cyclic radicals containing 6 to 10 carbon atoms in the ring.Typical compounds include dimethyl carbonate, diethyl carbonate, dipropyl carbonate, diphenyl carbonate, dicyclohexyl carbonate, and the like. Polyurethanes of this invention made with poly hexamethylene carbonate glycol have good properties. Small diols are used as chain extenders with the macropolyols and the p tetramethylxylenediisocyanate. These diols normally are aliphatic glycols or ether glycols containing 2 to 10 carbon atoms. Typical glycols which have been employed include ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, hexanediol, 2 ethylhexanediol1,6 neopentyl glycol, 1,4 butenediol, 2 butene 1,4 diol, and the like. Cycloaliphatic glycols such as cyclohexanedimethanol, and aromatic aliphatic glycols such as bis 1,4 P hydroxyethoxy benzene, may also be employ ed. The amount of glycol chain extender used with the macropolyol and the diisocyanate may vary from about 0.1 to 10 mols per mol of macroglycol. Excellent polyurethanes are obtained with a molar ratio of one mol of macropolyol and 1 to 5 mols of the small chain extender glycol. Substituted glycols also may be used. About equimolar ratios of diisocyanate and total polyols, i.e., OH to NCO groups, may be used.When a small polyol chain extender is used, the ratio of reactants employed may be varied from about 1.5 to 13 mols of diisocyanate per mol of macropolyol with 0.5 to 12 mols of the polyol. The amount of diisocyanate used is dependent on the total amount of chain extender and macropolyol, and normally is a molar amount essentially equivalent to the total of these latter reactants so that there are essentially no free unreacted isocyanate groups remaining in the polymer after polymerization. Excellent polyurethanes have been obtained when a molar ratio of one mol of macropolyol, 0.1 to 3 mols of diol chain extender and 1.1 to 4 mols of the diisocyanate are caused to react.While essentially equimolar amounts of isocyanate and active hydrogen groups are often preferred, it will be understood that small excesses of a reactant or excess organic diisocyanate can be used in forming prepolymers. Normally, there should be less than 0.005 percent by weight of unreacted isocyanate groups, preferably essentially no residual isocyanate groups, in the polyurethanes. Catalysts may be used to speed up the polyurethane formulations and any of those catalysts normally used by those skilled in the art may be employed.Typical catalysts include dibutylin dilaurate, stannous octoate, tertiary amines such as triethylamine and the like may be used, normally in amounts from about greater than 0.01 up to 10 phr of polyurethane, and more normally greater than about 0.025 up to 5 phr. In the following Examples, illustrating the practice of the invention, a mixture of the macropolyol and chain extender diol were heated to about 1000C to 1500C to melt the 2 polyols. The anti oxidant and ul traviolet stabilizers, catalyst and processing aid, if used, were added to the melted macropolyol chain extender mixture. The para tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate heated to about 100 C to 1500C was added to this mixture. Polymerization was rapid and exothermal. As the polymerization continues, a polymer melt was formed and the temperature of the reaction mixture reached and was maintained at about 2100C to 2350C for 3 to 5 minutes.The polymeric reaction products were allowed to cool at room temperature and then tested. The reactions were conducted in the substantial absence of moisture under vacuum or dry nitrogen.

The data also show the resistance to degradation of these novel polyurethanes by ultraviolet. Notable is the lack of discoloration, yellowing, shown by the essentially constant reflectance values after 1000 hours in the Fadeometer. In thin film particularly, these novel materials remain clear even after long exposure to light. In contrast, a similar polyurethane made with an aromatic diisocyanate, diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate showed a decrease in reflectance values from 75 to 33 after only 100 hours of Fadeometer exposure. The ultraviolet resistant thermoplastic polyurethanes of this invention find many uses where articles of polyurethanes are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, such as molded automotive exterior parts, in film and coatings exposed to sunlight, as in automotive windshield glass lamination, identification tags, extruded shapes and moldings, and the like.
