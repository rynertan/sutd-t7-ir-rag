# POLYAMIDE ACRYLIC GRAFT COPOLYMERS

## Abstract
A water dispersable graft copolymer of a polyamide and an acrylic monomer is prepared by reacting a polyamide with an acrylic monomer in an alcohol solution in the presence of a free radical peroxidic initiator, followed by neutralisation of the resultant copolymer solution. The product is particularly useful as the resin of a water based printing ink.
