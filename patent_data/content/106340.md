# Device for automatic cancelling of undesired radar echoes.

## Abstract
Device for automatic cancelling of undesired echoes of second trace and or of great distance, ensuring in radar system, particularly in radar systems generating a non ambiguous indication of the distance and having a transmit ter with a power oscillator which is normally on magnetron , an improvement of the cancellation of clutter echoes coming from distant zones near the beginning of the scale and the cancelling of second trace clutter echoes.
