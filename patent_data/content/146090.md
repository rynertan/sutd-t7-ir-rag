## Description
This invention relates to new sialyloligosaccharides which correspond to the non reducing terminal tetrasaccharide unit of N glycosidic sugar chain of glycoprotein such as borine blood coagulation factor II see E.G. Berger et all Experientia Sialic acid exists in a free or a combined form with sialoylglycoconjugate such as glycoprotein, glycolipid, oligosaccharide, polysaccharide, etc. in the surface of animal or bacterial cells and much attention is now focused thereon from a medical and pharmacological point of view as a compound showing effectivity in the fields of immunity, cancer, inflammation, virosis, cytodieresis, hormone reception, etc. With increase in use of chemotherapeutics such as adrenocortical hormones or immunosuppressant for the treatment of various diseases such as carcinosis, hypoimmunity and many kinds of side effects are observed and therefore, it is becoming more difficult to treat a patient suffering from such diseases as cancer. The inventors have paid attention to the importance of sialic acid, which is one of the inherent constituents of animal living body, as a marker on the cell surface and have conducted reactions of sialic acid halide as a glycosyl donor with various glycosyl acceptors. As a result, they have succeeded in the synthesis of new sialyloligosaccharides which are expected to cause no side effects and to possess many desired physiological activities such as adaptation of immunoresponse and have accomplished this invention. This invention provides sialyloligosaccharides of the general formula described below and a method for producing the same or wherein R₁ is hydrogen or methyl, R₂ is hydrogen or acetyl and R₃ is hydrogen or benzyl, and Ac is acetyl. Furthermore the present invention provides sialyloligosaccharides according to anyone of claims 2 to 7, a process of preparation according to claims 8, intermediate compounds according to anyone of claims 9 to 11, 13 and 14 and a process of preparation of intermediate compounds according to claim 12. Additionally the present invention comprises pharmaceutical preparations according to claim 15. The sialyloligosaccharides of the above general formula according to the present invention can be prepared by reacting the glycosyl donor of the general formula 12 , which can be derived from sialic acid by a conventional method, with the glycosyl acceptor, trisaccharide of the formula 10 to form tetrasaccharide and optionally removing acetyl, methyl or benzyl groups wherein Ac represents acetyl and Bn represents benzyl, wherein X represents halogen, preferably Cl or Br. The glycosyl donor 12 , the starting compound of the present invention, can be derived from sialic acid methyl ester peracetate 11 by Kuhn et al. method Chem. Ber., The glycosyl acceptor 10 , the other starting materials of the present invention, can be derived from the compound 6 which can be prepared as follows The compound 1 is reacted with the disaccharide donor 2 in the presence of AgOSO₂CF₃ and molecular sieves 4A powder to give the trisaccharide 3 which is treated with NaOCH₃ CH₃OH to give the compound 4 which is then treated with CH₃OH butylamine to give the compound 5 which is subsequently treated with Ac₂O pyridine to give the compound 6 . The compound 1 can be prepared by, for example, the method described in T. Ogawa, H. Yamamoto, Carbohydr. Res., 104 1982 271 283. The compound 2 can be prepared by the method described in M.M Ponpipom, R.L. Buglanesi, T.Y. Shen, Tetrahedron. Lett., 1978 1717 1720 J. Arnarp, J. Lonngren, J. Chem. Commun., 1980 1000 1002 J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 1981 2070 2074 T. Ogawa, S. Nakabayashi, Carbohydr. Res., 97 1981 81 86 P.U. Lemieux. S.Z. Abbas, B.Y. Chung, Can. J. Chem., 60 1982 58 62. The glycosyl acceptor 10 can be derived from the resulting compound 6 as shown below. The compound 6 is deacetylated by alkali metal alkoxide alcohol, such as NaOCH₃ CH₃OH to obtain the compound 7 which is then reacted with CH₃ ₂C OCH₃ ₂ in the presence of catalyst such as p toluenesulfonic acid p TsOH and subsequently acetylated by, for example, acetic anhydride pyridine to give 4,6 O isopropylidene derivative 8 and 3,4 O isopropylidene derivative 9 . The compound 8 is treated with acetic acid methanol to obtain the glycosyl acceptor 10 . The glycosyl acceptor 10 is reacted with the glycosyl donor 12 in such solvent as dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, etc. in the presence of glycosidation catalyst such as Hg CN ₂, HgBr₂, molecular sieves, Ag₂CO₃, AgClO₄, AgOSO₂ CF₃, CH₃ ₃COSO₂Cr₃, etc. at 20 All the compounds 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 13 , 14 , 15 and 16 thus obtained are new and have never been disclosed in any references. These compounds of the present invention may be employed as useful intermediates for the synthesis of the aforementioned sialoylglycoconjugate.
