# FACSIMILE DESIGN

## Abstract
A digital fax having geometrically compatible transduc ers 51 and 52 that directly convert the discrete picture elements pels . The geometric compatibility of the transduc ers is 51 and 52 combined with an odd pel count such that with equal and simultaneous movement via 62 of the transducers, the pels are selectively interlaced. The interlace is accomplished through selective incremential movement of the transducer improving the resolution and quality. Furth ermore, the electromechanical drive 58 and 62 is integrated into a single system instead of the previously encountered dual system, thereby conserving power and reducing the number of components, resulting in a more economical fax machine.
