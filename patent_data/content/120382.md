## Description
LOW VOLTAGE CABLE SpecificationThe present invention concerns a low voltage cable which is resistent to heat, and which does not propagate fires and more precisely, to an electric cable that is heat resistent and non fire propagating, that is included in the category of low voltage cables that are known under the name of building wires .The greater majority of cables that come into this category known under the above name, have conductor coverings formed out of a P.V.C. based compound.One drawback of these compounds, is that of their being thermoplastic and hence, incapable of providing any stability in form, during the action of heat that might be applied to the conductor covering.This is a drawback which could cause serious consequences, and for realizing this fact it is sufficient to consider the risks for the user himself, when, for example, in correspondence of a current collector owing to an overheating resulting from a bad connection of the cables to the latter,there is had a softening of the conductor coverings.Moreover, in the known cables, where the conductor covering is formed out of a thermoplastic compound based on P.V.C., it is impossible to have either any notable non fire propagating properties, or any optimization of the mechanical and insulating properties. In fact, in order to have such non fire propagating properties, it would be necessaryt to introduce into the compound itself, very high quantities of mineral fillers and this is unproposable, since it would reduce the mechanical and insulating properties of the compound and hence, of the said conductor covering, to unacceptable values.There have besides been proposed cables having a conductor covering made of a mixture again based on P.V.C., but crosslinked through radiation. If, in this manner, it was possible to solve the problem of providing stability of form to the conductor coverings of the cable under the action of heat, the other problems, of non propagating fires, were not solved, nor else the problem of the optimization of the mechanical and insulating properties of the cable.In fact, for the cross linking of the compounds forming the conductor covering of a cable, it was necessary to add to the compound an additive selected from divinylbenzene, polyallyl dimethacrylate esters and polyallyl trimethacrylate esters such as, for example trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate.These additives interact with the mineral fillers of the compound as well as with the P.V.C. during the cross linking of this latter, and hence, when the quantity of mineral fillers present in the compound is increased, inevitably even the quantities increase of the additives in question.Now, these cross linking additives of the P.V.C., have the drawback of reducing the insulating properties of the compound if, as inevitably occurs in practice, they are still present after the cross linking of the P.V.C., and hence, to reduce the dielectric properties in the conductor coverings of the cable formed out of such a compound.Therefore, for limiting the quantity of the cross linking agents present in the compound, the quantity of mineral fillers is limited and hence, cables that have the property of non propagating fires are not obtainable.The aim of the present invention is to have low voltage cables pertaining to the building wires category, having aP.V.C. base covering for the conductor in which there is encountered an optimum resistence to heat and against any propagation of fires and an optimiization both, of the dielectric characteristics as well as of the mechanical characteristics.What forms the object of the present inventi on, is a low voltage cable comprising a conductor with an extrudedcovering surrounding it, said extruded covering being constituted by a primary covering that is in contact with the conductor, and by a secondary covering surrounding the primary covering said coverings being made out of a P.V.C.based compound, characterized by the fact that the primary covering is of a thermoplastic compound, based on P.V.C., containing mineral fillers in quantities that are greater than 60 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of P.V.C., and that said secondary covering is a compound based on P.V.C. cross linked through radiation.The present invention will be better understood from the following detailed description, made solely by way of nonlimiting example, with reference to the FIGURE of the attached drawing TABLE, wherein there is shown a perspective view, with partially removed portions, of a length of cable according to this invention.As can be seen in the figure, the cable comprises a conductorI constituted by a single wire or by several layed up wires, surrounded by a covering comprised by an extruded primary covering 2, covered by a secondary covering 3, said coverings being closely joined together.The primary covering 2 is of a thermoplastic compound based on P.V.C., and the secondary covering 3 is made of a compound based on P.V.C. cross linked through radiation and hence, of a compound that, prior to being cross linked, contains the necessary additive for said operation.We shall now report the general characteristics that theP.V.C. based compounds must possess, for forming the primarycovering 2 and the secondary covering 3 of a cable according to the present invention.The compounds based on P.V.C., for the formation of the primary covering 2, are thermoplastics and contain mineral fillers in such quantities as to endow it with the dielectric properties and properties of resistence against fire propagation, that are desired. In particular, the mineral fillers present in the compound in question consisting of calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcined kaolin and mixtures thereof, are of a quantity that is greater than 60 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of P.V.C.Preferably, the quantity of mineral fillers present in the compound, is comprised between 60 and 120 parts by weight, with respect to 100 parts by weight of P.V.C., so as to obtain an optimization of the dielectric characteristics for the insulation 2 and a resistence against fire propagation.For the formation of the secondary covering 3, the compounds based on P.V.C. contain a cross linking agent selected from amongst the divinylbenzene, polyallyl dimethacrylate esters and polyallyl trimethacrylate esters such as, for example, the trimethylopropane trimethacrylate, of a quantity not exceeding 16 parts by weight, with respect to 100 parts by weight of P.V.C., and mineral fillers in quantities not exceeding 10 parts by weight, with respect to 100 parts by weight of P.V.C. Moreover, the mineral fillers for the compound forming the secondary covering 3, are constituted by calcium carbonate and by magnesium carbonate, and preferably of the type obtained through precipitation i.e. having a high specific surface. Even mixturess of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate of the types obtained through precipitation, can be utlized as fillers in the compound for the formation of the secondary covering.We shall now give herebelow, solely by way of example, the recipes of a particular compound for the covering 2, and of a particular compound for the covering 3, of a cable according to the invention.A compound for the formation of the primary covering 2 of a low voltage cable according to the invention has the following recipe, whose components are expressed in parts by weight.

In particular, the conductor is formed by thirty wires, each one having a diameter of 0.25 mm, layed up together with having a complexive section whose area is 1.5 mm2.The primary covering has a thickness of 0.7 mm and the superimposed layer, which after the cross linking through radiation, will constitute the secondary covering 3, has a thickness of 0.1 mm and, in any case, a thickness not exceeding 15 of the thickness of the primary covering.The conductor, covered by the extruded layers cited above, underwent radiation by means of causing it to pass through an apparatus of a per se known type, that furnished it with a dose of radiation equal to 10 M rad, so as to cross link the secondary covering of the cable, and the speed of production is in the same order of magnitude as that of the known cables having a conductor covering constituted entirely of a P.V.C.based thermoplastic compound.With a cable according to the present invention, experimental tests were carried out, according to the normes CEl 20 11, for the purpose of pointing out, in the conductor covering comprised by the assembly of the primary and the secondary covering the values of the insulation constant Ki at 200C expressed in MSL x Km the resistence to thermo compression, defined by the crushing force to be exerted upon a flat sample of conductor covering taken up to a temperature of 1200C, for reducing the thickness to a value equal to 60 of the initial thickness the mechanical characteristics of the breaking load and elongation at break. Moreover, with a cable according to the invention, experimental tests were carried out for determining the capacity of maintaining a stability in its form, at high temperatures, by suspending a cable length inside a chamber that is heated to 200 C. To end with, tests were carried out, according to the normes CEl 20 22, for checking the resistence against fire propagation. Tests were also carried out for determining the characteristics according to our invention, of the resistence to cable slipping, inside a duct. For this latter test, a cable length of 50 m according to the invention, was introduced into a rigid P.V.C. hose, shaped in the manner indicated below, with having an inner diameter of 30 mm and a length of 10 m.The shaped hose has a configuration constituted by a brokenline of equal segments and having curved corners, formed by the assembly of an S shape and of an L shape. On the extremity of the cable, facing one extremity of the hose, there was applied the minimum force necessary for extracting the cable from the hose, by causing it to slide into it.Moreover, for showing the optimum properties of a cable according to the invention, due to the simultaneous presence of a primary and a secondary cover having the above stated characteristics, there were effectuated, for. comparison purposes, the above cited experimental tests for a cable having a conductor covering formed with only the P.V.C. based thermoplastic compound used for the primary covering of a cable according to our invention.Identical experimental tests were carried out for a known cable having a conductor covering entirely formed of a P.V.C.based thermoplastic compound and for another known cable having a conductor covering entirely formed out of a P.V.C.based compound cross linked through radiation.The cable for comparison purposes, described previously, and both the known cables that underwent the experimental tests, had identical conductors to that of the cable according to our invention. and a thicknes for the conductor covering that was equal to the sum total of the thicknesses of the primary and the secondary coverings of the cable according to our invention.The results of these experimental tests are given in the following TABLE EMI9.1 tb SEP Cable SEP ac SEP I SEP Cable SEP for SEP I SEP Known SEP SEP Known tb SEP cording SEP compari SEP cable SEP cable tb SEP to SEP our SEP son SEP having SEP having tb SEP invention SEP purposes SEP a SEP thermo SEP its SEP con tb SEP plastic SEP ductor tb SEP sheath SEP sheath tb SEP µ SEP cross tb SEP linked tb SEP through tb SEP radiation tb Ki SEP at SEP 200C SEP SEP 2000 SEP 1 SEP 2000 SEP SEP 1000 SEP 1 SEP 750 tb SEP M x SEP Km SEP SEP M x SEP SEP Km SEP M x SEP SEP Km SEP M x SEP Km tb Resistence tb to SEP thermo SEP 9 SEP N SEP 5 SEP N SEP 4,5 SEP N SEP 4,5 SEP N tb compression tb SEP 10 tb EMI10.1 tb Breaking SEP I SEP I SEP I SEP tb load SEP under SEP 18 SEP N mm2 SEP 8 SEP N mm2 SEP 15 SEP N mm2 SEP 15 SEP N mm2 tb traction tb Elongation SEP SEP I SEP I SEP I tb at SEP break SEP I SEP I SEP I SEP tb under SEP 150 SEP 100 SEP 130 SEP 130 tb traction tb Stability SEP of SEP I SEP I SEP SEP I tb insulation tb form SEP inside SEP I SEP does SEP not SEP I SEP does SEP not SEP SEP melts SEP SEP does SEP not tb furnace SEP at SEP melt SEP melt SEP down SEP melt tb temperature SEP down SEP I SEP down SEP I SEP I SEP down tb of SEP 2000C SEP SEP I SEP l SEP I tb Fire tb propagation tb test SEP ac SEP I SEP does SEP not SEP I SEP does SEP not SEP I SEP spreads SEP I SEP spreads tb cording SEP to SEP spread SEP spread SEP fire SEP fire tb standard SEP fire SEP fire tb CEI SEP 20 22 tb Resistence tb to SEP slipping tb inside SEP a SEP 17 SEP N SEP 20 SEP N SEP 30 SEP N SEP 17 SEP N tb duct SEP I SEP l SEP tb After examining the results of the tests carried out, the following considerations can be put forward. First and foremost, it can be realized that the presence of a secondary P.V.C. based covering cross linked through radiation, did not bring about any reduction in the insulation constant Ki of a cable according to the present invention as was possible to expect on observing the values of the insulation constant of a known cable having a conductor covering entirely formed out of a P.V.C. based compound, cross linked through radiation.It is true that the absolute values, as is possible to draw from the description of the particular form of realization described of a cable according to the present invention, the thickness of the secondary covering is extremely reduced, but even such a reduced thickness would have had an influence on the value of the insulation constant of the conductor covering of the cable.The fact that what has been stated above is not verified, signifies that the secondary covering of a cable according to this invention, has surprizingly, optimum insulation properties in spite of its being formed out of a P.V.C, based compound, cross linked through radiation.Moreover, from examining the results of the experimental tests that are given in the TABLE, it is found that, with a cable according to the invention, all the previously stated proposed aims are achieved.To end with, with a cable according to the invention, there can be obtained a good production speed in spite of the need for cross linking the secondary covering itself through radiation. In fact, the manufacturing speed of a cable according to our invention, expressed in metres minutes, is in the same order of magnitude as that of the 1known cables having a conductor covering made of a P.V.C. based thermoplastic coupound whereas the manufacturing speed of the known cables having a conductor covering of a P.V.C. based compound cross linked through radiation, is generally slower by 30. The reason for this is due not solely to the fact that the thickness of the secondary covering, of a cable according to our invention, is small, but it is also due to the fact that inside it, the absence, or the minute quantities of the mineral fillers present, allows for keeping to the minimum the quantity of cross linking agents for the P.V.C. and hence, for keeping the dose of radiation energy that has to be furnished, also to the minimum.Although one form of realization, according to the invention, has been illustrated and described hereabove, this patent must also be understood to comprise within its ambit, all the other embodiments derived from the inventive idea, that are available to any technician of this field.
