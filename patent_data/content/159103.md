# Process control apparatus.

## Abstract
A process control apparatus has a controller 22 for performing a control operation including an integral opera tion for a set point signal supplied to a process 20 and an output signal from the process 20 and for generating a control signal to the process 20 , and a reference model 26 which has a desired transfer function of a control system and which receives the set point signal. The process control apparatus further has a first subtractor 28 for subtracting the output signal of the reference model 26 from the output signal of the process 20 , an output error compensator 24 for performing a control operation including an integral operation for the output error and for generating a compen sation signal in such a manner that the output error becomes zero, and a second subtractor 30 for subtracting the compensation signal from the output control signal of the controller 22 .
