# Method for isomerizing glucose to fructose.

## Abstract
A deactivation inhibitor for enzymes, such as glucose isomerase, comprises a carrier on which are bonded the ions of a metal capable of assuming different states of oxidation, such as Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Sn, Ce and Ag, or a mixture of such ions. The carrier may be a synthetic organic e.g. styrene based ion exchanger. In an enzyme reaction method, the substrate treated with the enzyme may be contacted with the enzyme deactivation inhibitor either prior to or during the course of the reaction.
