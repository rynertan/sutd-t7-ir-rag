# A process for preparing 1,7 octadiene.

## Abstract
A process for hydrodimerizing butadiene to form 1,7 octadiene in high yields comprises hydrodimerizing butadiene in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a tertiary phosphine, a solvent which is a dialkyl sulphoxide, a N, N dialkylalkanamide, a substituted or unsubstituted pyridine or sulfolane or a mixture of two or more thereof, a formate of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal or ammonia and, in the case that the formate is a formate of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, at least one mole of water per mole of formate.
