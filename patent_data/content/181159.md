# Heat sealable plastics laminate.

## Abstract
A crystalline random propylene copolymer composition suitable for use in a heat sealable laminate comprising also a crystalline propylene polymer substrate layer, comprises i a crystalline random propylene copolymer comprising 99 to 85 mole of propylene and 1 to 15 mole of an alpha olefin other than propylene and ii a random 1 butene copolymer comprising 1 butene and an alpha olefin having at least 5 carbon atoms, the weight ratio of copolymer i to copolymer ii being from 5 95 to 90 10 and said random 1 butene copolymer ii satisfying the following conditions A it comprises 50 to 99 mole of the 1 butene component and from 50 to 1 mole of the alpha olefin, B it has an intrinsic viscosity η , measured in decalin at 135 C, of from 0.5 to 6 dl g, C it has a melting point Tm , measured by a differen tial scanning calorimeter, of from 30 to 120 C, D it has a crystallinity, measured by X ray diffrac tometry, of from 5 to 60 , E the amount W₁ in by weight of that portion of it which is soluble in boiling methyl acetate is not more than 2 , and F the amount W₂ in by weight of that portion of it which is soluble in a 1 1 by volume mixture of acetone and n decane at 10 C is 5 η
