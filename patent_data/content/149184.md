# Apparatus for transferring relatively flat objects.

## Abstract
An apparatus for transferring a relatively flat object from a first station 10 to a second station 60 includes a support 11 for the object at the first station, a substantially closed housing, and a piston disposed therein for sliding movement from a normal position to an activated position. An actuator 112 extends through the housing and is integrally formed with the piston for sliding movement thereby. Compressed air is selectively directed into the housing for movement of the piston to the activated position, whereby the actuator 112 strikes a blow edgewise of the object for propelling it toward the second station along a predetermined path 116 . A pair of fingers 130 disposed at the second station define therebetween a portion of the path along which an incoming object enters the second station. Each finger includes a path wall having an end surface extending generally inwardly from the finger for blocking the object path for halting object movement. A spring pawl extending partially into the path from each finger prevents rebounding of the object from the end surfaces.
