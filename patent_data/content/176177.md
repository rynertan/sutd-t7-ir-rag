# Thermoplastic sheet preparation method.

## Abstract
A method for the preparation of a sheet of a crystalline thermoplastic resin, e.g. polypropylene, having excellent transparency, surface properties and thermoformability comprises quenching a molten extruded sheet in a slit where cooling water flows at a velocity higher than the running of the extruded molten sheet, and stretching the quenched sheet in a stretch ratio of from 1.02 to 2.00 times.
