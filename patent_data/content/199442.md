## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION ExerciserBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to an exerciser used in the field of health apparatuses for developing users physical strength, in which a crank shaft receiving load torque is rotated by pedals. More particularly, it relates to an exerciser which is employed as a health apparatus for home use.Description of the Prior Art There have generally been provided various kinds of treadle type sporting apparatuses such sporting apparatuses are hereinafter referred to as exerciser in this specification for readily taking exercise by working pedals. In such conventional techniques, Japanese patent publication gazette No. 8267 1983 discloses the prior art of interest for the present invention. Namely, the said gazette discloses an exerciser formed by a mechanical structure portion including a frame, a rotating portion including a pedal, a brake portion of an eddy current system, a control system including a sensor and a control panel including a display window. In the invention disclosed in the aforementioned publication gazette, the exerciser is in such structure that the user inputs target exercise data every fime he uses the exerciser so that the control system in the exerciser controls the amount of load applied to the brake portion on the basis of the data. Thus, the user must input his personal data through the control panel each time before use by troublesome data input operation. Further, in the invention described in the aforementioned publication gazette, the brake torque amount of load is uniformly controlled and cannot sufficiently follow the user s physical conditions which vary with the case. In other words, the brake torque cannot be accommodated by control to the manner of increase in the user s pulse rate and the target pulse rate level varying with the case. Therefore, the said exerciser cannot automatically make the user perform training in a preferable manner for increasing his pulse rate to reach the target level and maintaining the same correspondingly to individual difference. It is an objec t of the present invention to provide an exerciser which overcomes the aforementioned respective disadvantages.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is in such structure including a load unit to be driven by the user, a pulse data detecting means provided in relation to the load unit for detecting the pulse data of the user driving the load unit, a storage means which previously stores personal data such as the user s age and physical strength, a identification code input means for inputting a personal identification code for specifying the user, a means for reading personal data corresponding to the inputted identification code from the storage means and a control means for controlling conditions of exercise which can be performed by the load unit on the basis of the read personal data and data on the pulse rate of the user in exercise obtained from the pulse detecting means. In the first place, inputted from the identification code input means is a personal identification code for a person to use the exerciser. In response to this, personal data corresponding to the identification code are read from the storage means, to be set as the user s data.Thereafter the user performs exercise by driving the load unit, whereby data on the user s pulse are successively supplied from the pulse data detecting means to the control means. The control means controls the load level of the load unit on the basis of the user s personal data as set in the aforementioned manner and changes in the pulse rate data during the exercise, thereby to adjust conditions of the exercise that can be performed by the user in accordance with the situation and desired conditions of the user s exercise. According to the present invention, personal basic data including age and sex are previously stored so that the data can be readily called by personal codes, whereby the user of the exercise is released from trouble of inputting the personal basic data every time he uses the exerciser. Further, the load unit is so controlled as to present a load level corresponding to the personal basic data, i,e., age, sex, physical strength and the like, thereby to attain an appropriate training effect in response to individual difference. The load torque is controlled on the basis of target level of the pulse rate in the automatic training mode, whereby the user can take ideal exercise while maintaining the target pulse rate. Further, since the function of the physical strength test mode.is provided, the user can immediately perform a physical strength test thereby to objectively recognize his physical strength level by comparing the same with standard physical strength data. Thus, the exerciser can be widely used for confirming general physical strength and health care In addition, the exerciser according to the present invention is provided with the printer for printing the training data and the physical strength test data to be kept for user in long term care for physical strength and care. Further, the liquid crystal display unit displays a number of items for simultaneously showing various types of numerical data, whereby required data can be readily simultaneously confirmed conveniently. These object and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a plan view of a control panel characterizing the present invention Fig. 2 is illustrative of the entire structure of an exerciser according to an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 3 is a block diagram showing the structure of a control system of the exerciser Fig. 4 is a sectional view of the control panel shown in Fig. 1 taken along the line IV IV with internal structure being omitted Fig. 5 is a diagram for illustrating display contents displayed on the liquid crystal display unit Fig. 6 is a diagram for illustrating recording contents printed by a printer Fig. 7 is an illustration showing key sequence for setting or changing initial data in an automatic training mode Figs. 8, 9 and 10 are flow charts for illustrating controlling operations in respective modes Fig. 11 is an illustration showing the content of personal basic data stored in a microcomputer Fig. 12 is a flow chart showing a control operation for evaluating physical strength and Fig. 13 is a graph showing standard levels of physical strength.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Detailed description is now made on an embodiment of the present invention with reference to the drawings. First, the features of this embodiment are listed as follows 1 Personal basic data for respective users are previously stored in a storage means, whereby corresponding personal basic data can be read by inputting a user s personal code identification code . Thus, the user is released from troublesomeness of inputting his personal basic data every time he starts using the exerciser. The personal basic data are set for respective modes as hereinafter described as follows For automatic training mode code number personal code , age, sex, target pulse rate, target time, upper bound pulse rate For manual training mode code number, age, sex, upper bound pulse rate, target time, initial load set value For physical strength test mode code number, age, sex, upper bound pulse rate, weight, load increase width set value.The respective basic data can be appropriately changed if necessary. 2 The mode of the exerciser according to this embodiment can be selected by the user from the automatic training mode, manual training mode and physical strength test mode. When the automatic training mode is selected, the exerciser is so controlled that the level of the pulse rate detected from the user is coincident with the target level, while the load level is controlled so as to maintain the coincident state of the user s pulse rate with the set target level. Therefore, the user can take exercise in constant load strength for his heart function under training in said training mode. When the user starts the exercise in the case where the physical strength test mode is selected, the exerciser is controlled to increase the load torque in a staged manner in set increase width per constant time. Then the pulse rate levels and power watt at the ends of respective load stages are stored thereby to calculate the maximum power capacity wPWC and the maximum oxygen uptake MOP per unit weight and unit time. The MOP level is compared with a previously stored list of physical strength level ranks, thereby to objectively evaluate the user s physical strength level. 3 The exerciser according to the embodiment is provided with a display unit having large display capacity and a printer. Therefore, the display unit can simultaneously display a great amount of information, whereby the user can simultaneously confirm required information. Further, training data, physical strength test data or the like are printed out with the exercise, whereby the user can effectively use the printed data for his health care etc. Description is now definitely made on the embodiment of the present invention.

Fig. I shows a state in which the whole displayable contents are displayed. The key switch portion 29 has various types of keys so as to input necessary commands, data and the like. Description is now made on various symbols displayed on the display panel 6 as shown in Fig. 1. Symbol PLL indicates the upper bound pulse rate, and the display of this symbol PLL on the liquid crystal display unit 28 is indicative of that the numerical value in the right hand side thereof indicates the upper bound pulse rate. The Pli key in the key switch portion 29 is pressed in order to change the numerical value of the upper bound pulse rate displayed on the liquid crystal display unit 28. With respect to the display on the liquid crystal display unit 28, symbol ETM indicates elapsed time TTM target exercise time, WT user s weight, EC calorie exhausted by exercise, MOU user s maximum oxygen uptake, TPL target pulse rate, CTQ current load torque, STQ set load torque, PFL user s physical strength level, rpm number of rotation of pedal, AGE user s age, AUTO automatic training mode, MANIC manual training mode, TEST physical strength test mode, COD personal code, POW power, PWC maximum power capacity and SEX user s sex.

Symbols shown on respective keys in the key switch portion 29 are similar to the aforementioned contents, and corresponding keys are pressed in order to display desired data on the liquid crystal display unit 28 and to change the data in display Within the said keys, a wWIw key is for setting and changing exercise strength, RESETS key for reset operations, tt key for feeding recording paper of the printer 35, TM EC key for switching time calorie display and STEP key for advancing a program to a next one.Further, 7AUTO , 8MANUw and 9 TEST keys, respectively serving as ten keys, also have functions of selecting the mode of the exerciser, 6IOAD and 3 LOAD keys are ten keys also having functions of indicating increase or decrease in the amount of the load applied to the load unit, and 1 MALE and 2 FEMALE keys are ten keys also having functions for inputting the user s sex. Further, arranged in the upper right side of the key switch portion 29 are a power supply lamp 46 which is turned on off in response to power supply on off states of the display panel 6 and a battery life indicator lamp 47 turned on when replacement of the battery is necessary . Referring now to Figs. 5 and 6, description is made on contents displayed on the liquid crystal display unit 28 and recording contents printed out by the printer 35 in the respective modes. Figs. 5 1 to 5 6 illustrate display contents displayed on the liquid crystal display unit 28 in the automatic training mode, Figs. 5 7 to 5 9 those in the manual training mode and Figs. 5 10 to 5 12 those in the physical strength test mode respectively. Fig. 6 1 illustrates the recording content in the automatic training mode, Fig. 6 2 that in the manual training mode and Fig. 6 3 that in the physical strength test mode. 1 Description on display and recording contents in automatic training mode When the power supply switch is turned on, the liquid crystal display unit 28 displays the content as shown inFig. 5 1 . The printer mark 45 indicates that the printer 35 operates simultaneously with starting of the operation, and when recording of the exercise is unnecessary, a printer mark switch in the key switch portion 29 is pressed to turn off the mark 45. When the 7.AUTO key is pressed, the liquid crystal display unit 28 displays the content as shown in Fig.5 2 . Namely, remaining is only the display telling that the automatic training mode is selected from the three modes shown in vertical three rows in Fig. 5 1 . It is to be noted that when the 8wMANU key is pressed, the display training mode is displayed as MANU indicative of the manual training mode in place of AUTO while the same is displayed as TEST indicative of the physical strength test mode when the 9zTEST key is pressed. Then, when a personal code is inputted by a ten key, the liquid crystal display unit 28 displays the content as shown in Fig. 5 3 . Since this embodiment is applied to an exerciser of home use, the personal codes are expressed by single figures so as to specify the user by nine numerals 1 to 9R, A 0 key functions as an initial data setting key for non registrants. Displayed upon the input of the personal code are the said code 2 in the display as shown in Fig. 5 3 and the upper bound pulse rate PLL stored in the memory correspondingly to the said personal code, target exercise time zTTM , target pulse rate TPL , age AGE and sex SEX . The sex is indicated by I for the male and 2 for the female. The numerical value of the upper bound pulse rate PLL is generally automatically displayed by 200 age , whereas such display may be changed. Thus, initial setting and change of personal basic data called in response to the personal code can be performed in accordance with key sequence as shown in Fig. 7. Symbol x of cx, x in Fig. 7 is indicative of optional ten keys. Description is now made on display contents under exercise in the automatic training mode. The display contents are shown in Figs. 5 4 and 5 5 . When the STEP key is pressed, control is started to display the content as shown in Fig. 5 4 , whereby the heart mark 43 goes on and off in response to the pulse while the current pulse rate e.g., 79 is displayed.The numerical value of.the current load torque wCTQz is automatically set in 0.5 Kgem as the initial value and displayed. When the exercise is started, the content of Fig.5 5 is displayed thereby to display current values of the pulse rate, elapsed time ETM , current load torque CTQ , number of pedal rotation and power POW respectively. In order to match the actual pulse rate with the target level TPL , the current load torque CTQ is automatically increased or decreased in steps of 0.1 Kgm when the pulse rate is out of the range of 5 per minute. Fig. 5 6 shows a state in which the exercise is terminated and the TM EC key is pressed to display the exhausted calorie. When the TM EC key is pressed, the display content of the liquid crystal display unit 28 is shifted to the display of the exhausted calorie EC in place of the elapsed time ETM , even if the user is under exercise.Display switching between the elapsed time ETC and the exhausted calorie ECw may be alternately selected by the TM EC key. After the lapse of the target exercise time in the automatic training mode, the microcomputer 24 see Fig 3 supplies a signal to the buzzer amplifier 31, thereby to operate the buzzer 32. On the other hand, when the STEP key for starting the exercise is pressed, the printer 35 prints exercise conditions and the like and then prints the current value of the pulse rate PLS and that of the power W on printing paper every 30 seconds, so long as the operation setting for the printer 35 is not released.Fig. 6 1 shows the format thereof. The user can take the exercise while observing the state of this recording. The pulse rate is also recorded on a graph in addition to printing of the numerical values. When the exercise is terminated and the STEP key is pressed by the user, the calorie EC exhausted during the exercise is printed whereby the printed is stopped. This recording paper can be utilized as material for health care for the user, and particularly the exhausted calorie data EC can be used as the data for beauty and reduction of weight for women. 2 Description on display and recording contents in the manual training mode When the 8MANUw key is pressed in the initial display as shown in Fig. 5 1 , the manual training mode corresponding to Fig. 5 2 is selectively displayed and when the personal code is inputted by the ten key in the said display, the liquid crystal display unit 28 displays the content as shown in Fig, 5 7 . In the display as shown in Fig. 5 7 , the numerical value of the set load torque STQ e.g., 1.5 Kg m can be set at or changed to an optional value by a key operation WI lxi, wxw x indicates optional ten key . Other data are set and changed in a similar manner to the automatic training mode. When the exercise is started after the STEP key is pressed, the liquid crystal display unit 28 displays the content as shown in Fig. 5 8 . Such display is similar to the display of the automatic training mode as shown inFig. 5 5 except for that the current load torque CTQ is displayed with the set torque STY as the initial value and increased or decreased by operations of the power 6LOAD and 5fLOAD keys. The time display of the elapsed time ETM and the calorie display of the exhausted calorie EC can be selectively switched by the TM EC key. When the STEP key for starting the exercise in the manual training mode is pressed, the printer 35 starts printing of the recording data in the format as shown inFig. 6 2 . 3 Description on display and recording contents in the physical strength test mode When the 9TEST key is pressed in the initial display as shown in Fig. 5 1 to selectively display the physical strength test mode corresponding to Fig. 5 2 and then the personal code is inputted by the ten key during this display, the unit displays the content as shown inFig. 5 10 . In such display, the numerical value of the weight WT can be set at or changed to an optional value by key operation WT nxw x . Other values are set and changed in a similar manner to the automatic training mode, and these values are automatically called by the personal code and displayed on condition that initial setting is performed. In the physical strength test mode, the set load torque n STQn is used as increase width of the load. Such usage is hereinafter described in detail. When the STEP key is pressed to start the operation for controlling the exerciser, the liquid crystal display unit 28 displays the content as shown in Fig. 5 11 . In Fig. 5 11 , the numerical value of the current load torque CTQ is automatically increased at 3 minute intervals after the lapse of the first one minute from the initial level of 0.5 ggm. The rate of such increase is set in the first place as the value STY of the display by the user in response to his physical strength. In the case of the display according to this embodiment, the said increase is made by 0.5 Kg.m at a time. When the load level is increased by three times at 3 minute intervals after the lapse of the first one minute, i.e., after the lapse of 10 minutes in total including the first one minute, the liquid crystal display unit 28 displays the content as shown in Fig. 5 12 , thereby to display the respective numerical values of the maximum power capacity PWC , maximum oxygen uptake MOU and physical strength level PFL . The numerical value displayed as the physical strength level PFL is divided in five ranks as shown in Fig. 13, as hereinafter described. Simultaneously with pressing of the STEP key for starting, the printer 35 prints changes in the power watt and the pulse rate during the exercise every 30 seconds following printing of set conditions in the format as shown in Fig. 6 3 . Indication Inc. TQ. 0.5 in the printed set values shows that increase width of the load is 0.5 Kg.m. After the lapse of 10 minutes, the printer prints the result of physical strength evaluation and is then stopped. Figs. 8 to 10 are flow charts of operations centering around the microcomputer 24 for the respective modes as hereinabove described. Contents of these flow charts are now briefly described. Referring to Fig. 8, the power source for the control panel 6 is turned on step S1 , whereby the training mode is selected step S2 . This operation is performed by selective pressing of any one of the 7AUTO , 8 MANU and 9 TESTY keys by the user. When the automatic training mode is selected by the mode selection, an automatic program set in the CPU 25 see Fig. 3 is read step S3 , so that the exerciser is controlled along the said automatic program as hereinafter described. When the personal code is inputted by a ten key stepS4 , personal basic data age, sex, upper bound pulse rate, target pulse rate and target exercise time corresponding to the personal code are read from the memory to be displayed on the liquid crystal display unit 28 step S5 . Thus, the aforementioned content as shown in Fig. 5 3 is displayed. The personal basic data read at this time are previously stored in the memory of the microcomputer 24. Fig. 11 shows an example of the content thereof. As shown in Fig. 11, the personal basic data are stored in units of 8 bits for the respective data by employment of a RAM address per data. When change of the displayed personal basic data is necessary, such change is made at a step 56. Initial setting is also performed at the step S6. Generally no particular setting nor change is required after the second time use, and hence the step S6 is skipped and the process is advanced to a next step S7. Thus, the user is only required to input his personal code whereby trouble of inputting a number of personal basic data is saved to prevent complicatedness in data input. When a starting command signal is inputted at the step S7, the microcomputer 24 operates various sensors and timers so as to perform starting of detection of the pulse rate, automatic setting of the initial load level, starting of detection of the number of pedal rotation, starting of timers and starting of the printer step S8 .When the user rotates the pedals to start the exercise step S9 , the microcomputer 24 performs various control and arithmetic as shown in a step S10, Namely, the microcomputer 24 detects the user s current pulse rate step S101 , compares the same with the target pulse rate step S102 and automatically increases or decreases the load level step S103 . The microcomputer 24 further detects the current number of pedal rotation step 51 04 thereby to perform arithmetic on power on the basis of the load level and the number of pedal rotation step S106 . Then it measures the elapsed time step S105 , subtracts the same from the target exercise time step S107 and operates the buzzer when the elapsed time is up step S108 .Further, the microcomputer 24 performs arithmetic on the exhausted calorie required for the user s exercise from the calculated power step S106 and the elapsed time step 5109 . The aforementioned respective control and arithmetic processing are performed in a parallel manner by time divisional interruption processing. Upon termination of the exercise step S11 , input of a termination command is waited step S12 , and the printer prints the exhausted calorie and is stopped stepS13 . Similarly when, referring to Fig. 9, the manual training mode is selected, the microcomputer 24 performs control according to a manual program. In this case, control and arithmetic contents for the load unit after starting of the exercise are slightly different. Namely, the comparison with the target pulse rate step S102 and the control for automatically increasing or decreasing the load level step S103 in the automatic training mode are not performed, and commands by the 6LOAD and 3 LOAD keys are detected in order to increase or decrease the load level step 5305 . Other processing is similar to that described with reference Fig. 8. The physical strength test mode is now described with reference to Fig. 10. Control operation in the physical strength test mode is different at a step S50. Namely, the elapsed time is detected step S503 and the load level is increased by stages per lapse of a prescribed time, i.e., at 3 minute intervals after the lapse of the first one minute in this embodiment step S506 . Then the power is calculated from the current number of pedal rotation and the amount of load step S507 . When the test is terminated step S51 , arithmetic is performed on the user s maximum power capacity and maximum oxygen uptake MOU steps S509 and S508 , thereby to perform arithmetic on evaluation of the physical strength level based on the result step S52 and the results thus obtained are printed out step S53 . When the user s pulse rate exceeds the set upper bound pulse rate at the steps S101 to S109 in Fig. 8, steps S501 to S507 in Fig. 9 and steps S301 to S308 in Fig. 10, the load level is immediately decreased to the minimum 0.5 Kg m for safety thereby to stop the control. The control operation for the evaluation of the physical strength level at the step S52 is performed according to the flow chart as shown in Fig. 12. Namely, the sex data is read from the personal basic data to select the sex and the age data is read from the personal basic data to select the age group while the rank of the physical strength level is decided by the maximum oxygen uptake MOP operated at the step S508 whereby the result of physical strength evaluation is displayed on the liquid crystal display unit 28 and printed by the printer 35. The respective selected personal basic data and MOP value as hereinabove described are previously stored in the memory of the microcomputer 24. The contents thereof are, e.g., those as shown in the graph illustrated in Fig.13. The user s physical strength level is displayed in five stages by comparison with the data on general physical levels as shown in Fig. 13. Such physical strength levels vary with American,European and Japanese types as shown in Fig. 13, and hence a manual changeover switch or the like is provided to enable selection as to which type of standard physical strength level the comparison is made with. Such a manual switch is provided on, e.g., the back surface of the control panel 6. The first block in Fig. 12 is provided for this purpose. The aforementioned embodiment is applied to an exerciser for home use and hence the personal code is prepared by a single figure so as to save the storage capacity of the memory in the microcomputer 24, whereas such storage capacity may be increased with personal code combinations of a plurality of digits e.g., combinations of four figure digits when the present invention is applied to an exercise for business use such as that located in a sports center, since the number of the users is increased. Or, when ID cards storing personal codes are prepared in a readable manner, personal basic data on users can be called by the said ID cards, whereby the exerciser is made convenient to handle. Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims.
