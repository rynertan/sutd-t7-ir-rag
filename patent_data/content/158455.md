# Tubular connector.

## Abstract
An improved tubular connector 10 includes a first tubular member 12, a second tubular member 14, the members hav ing external grooves 28, 30 near their ends which are to be jointed, a plurality of latching segments 32 having internal projections 34 adapted to engage in the grooves of both said first tubular member and said second tubular member and also having external tapered surfaces, and an actuator ring 36 having an internal tapered surface 38 matching and en gaging the external tapered surfaces of said latching seg ments. Movement of the actuator ring in one direction wedges the segments into tight latching engagement with said grooves on the tubular members and movement in the other direction releases the segments to allow them to dis engage from said grooves on said tubular members. An ex ternal retaining groove 46 is formed in one of the tubular members, and a split ring 44 is positioned in the external retaining groove and engages the actuator ring to exert a force thereon which retains it in each of its extreme positions.
