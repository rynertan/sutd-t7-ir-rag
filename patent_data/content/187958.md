## Description
RESIN FOR INFORMATION RECORDING MEDIUM The present invention relates to a resin for an information recording medium, and more particularly to a resin for use as a substrate of an information recording medium such as video disc, compact disc, audio disc, information file disc for computer, or the like. Information recording media such as video disc, compact disc, audio disc, information file disc for computer and the like have been developed and put to practical use with the development of. an information oriented society. Transparent resins have been used as the substrate of these discs and these substrates have been usually prepared by injection or compression molding. Examples of such transparent resins used in the preparation of substrate include polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, and polycarbonate resins, among which polymethyl methacrylate and polycarbonate resins have been put to practical use as the particularly preferred resins from the viewpoints of light transmittance, moldability, birefringence index, etc. Polymethyl methacrylate and polycarbonate resins have been particularly preferred resins for disc substrates so far. However, they have disadvantages originating from their own characteristics described as follows. Since polymethyl methacrylate resin has a relatively high water absorption, it is liable to cause dimensional changes by moisture absorption and a substrate prepared therefrom tends to warp or to crack by repeated drying and moisture absorption over a long period of time. In an audio disc, information signal is recorded only on one side of the disc substrate which has much larger surface area than the other side and the difference of the surface area easily exhibits a deformation such as in the form of an umbrella under high humidity conditions.Further, polymethyl methacrylate resin is liable to suffer heat softening remarkably at about 100 to 110 CC. Though the resin has a merit in that a less oriented substrate than polycarbonate resin can be obtained by injection or compression molding, it has a disadvantage that the heat softening resistance is unsatisfactory. Polycarbonate resin has a higher heat softening resistance than that of the polymethyl methacrylate resin, but it is liable to be oriented in injection or compression molding and its birefringence index is increased. Because an increased birefringence index adversely affects reproduced sound and image, it is necessary to take appropriate countermeasures for the successful use of the polycarbonate resin. They include, for example, reduction of the molecular weight to lower the melt viscosity during molding, control of the molding conditions to inhibit orientation, and recording of signals on only the central part of a disc. Though polycarbonate resin has a higher heat softening resistance than that of the polymethyl methacrylate, it suffers abrupt heat softening at about 1400C and therefor it also has a serious problem in this respect. An object of the present invention is to provide a resin for use as a substrate for transparent discs, which has excellent water absorptivity, heat softening resistance and birefringence index. The resin of the present invention comprises a polymer having a crosslinked structure and, preferably, containing at least one ring selected from the group consisting of an aromatic ring, a cyclohexane ring and a heterocyclic ring as its repeating unit. Such a polymer can be obtained by cast polymerizing a monomer having at least two radicalpolymerizable double bonds per molecule and, preferably, containing at least one ring selected from the group consisting of an aromatic ring, a cyclohexane ring and a heterocyclic ring as a starting metarial. Examples of such monomers include polyallyl esters such as bisallyl terephthalate, bis B methylallyl terephthalate, bisallyl isophthalate, bis B methylallyl isophthalate, triallyl trimellitate, tri B methylallyl trimellitate, bis allyloxycarbonylmethyl terephthalate, bis B methyl allyloxycarbonylmethyl terephthalate, diallyl 5,5 1 dimethyl biphenyl 3,3 dicarboxylate, diallyl 1,9 dimethoxy naphthalene 3,7 dicarboxylate and diallyl 1,1 dimethyl diphenyl methane 3,3 dicarboxylate polyallyl carbonates such as 1,3 benzenebis allyl carbonate , 1,3 benzenebis B methylallyl carbonate , 1,4 benzenebis allyl carbonate , 1,4 benzenebis B methylallyl carbonate , 1,5 naphthalenebis allyl carbonate , 1,5 naphthalenebis B methylallyl carbonate ,l,6naphthalenebis allyl carbonate , 1,6 naphthalenebis ss methylallyl carbonate , l,7 naphthalenebis allyl carbonate , 1,7naphthalenebis B methylallyl carbonate , 2,6 naphthalenebis allyl carbonate , 2,6 naphthalenebis B methylallyl carbonate , 2,7 naphthalenebis allyl carbonate , 2,7naphthalenebis B methylallyl carbonate , 4,4 diphenylpropanebis allyl carbonate , 4,4 diphenylpropanebis Bmethylallyl carbonate , 4,4 diphenylsulfonebis allyl carbonate , and 4,4 diphenylsulfonebis ss methylallyl carbonate , 1,3 bis hydroxyethoxy benzene bis allyl carbonate , 1,3 bis hydroxyethoxy benzene bis B methylallyl carbonate , 1 1,4 bis hydroxyethoxy benzene bis allyl carbonate , 1,4 bis hydroxyethoxy benzene bis B methylallyl carbonate , 1,5 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis allyl carbonate , 1,5 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis Bmethylallyl carbonate , 1,6 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis allyl carbonate , 1,6 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis B methylallyl carbonate , 1,7 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis allyl carbonate , 1, 7 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis B methylallyl carbonate , 2,6 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis allyl carbonate , 2,6 bisthydroxy ethoxy naphthalene bis B methylallyl carbonate , 2,7bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis allyl carbonate , 2,7 bis hydroxyethoxy naphthalene bis B methylallyl carbonate , 4,4 bis hydroxyethoxy diphenylpropane bis allyl carbonate , 4,4 bis hydroxyethoxy diphenylpropane bis B methylallyl carbonate , 4,4 bis hydroxyethoxy diphenylsulfone bis allyl carbonate 4,4 bis hydroxyethoxy diphenylsulfone bis B methylallyl carbonate poly meth acrylates such as 1,4diacryloxybenzene, 1,4 dimethacryloxybenzene, 1,4 diacryloxyethoxybenzene, 1,4 dimethacryloxyethoxybenzene, 1,5diacryloxynaphthalene, 1,5 dimethacryloxynaphthalene, 1,5bis B acryloxyethoxy naphthalene, 1,5 bis B methacryloxyethoxy naphthalene, 2,2 bis acryloxyXbiphenyl, 2,2 bis methacryloxy biphenyl, 2,2 bis B acryloxyethoxy biphenyl, 2,2 bis B methacryloxyethoxy biphenyl, 2,Ã‡ bis 4 acryloxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 mehthacryloxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 acryloxyethoxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4methacryloxyethoxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 acryloxypoly ethoxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 methacryloxypolyethoxyphenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 acryloxyethoxydiphenyl sulfone, 2,2 bis methacryloxyphenyl sulfone, 2,2 bis 3 acryloyl 2hydroxypropoxy biphenyl, 2,2 bis 3 methacryloyl 2 hydroxypropoxy biphenyl, 2,2 bis 3 acryloyl 2 hydroxypropoxyphenyl propane and 2,2 bis 3 methacryloyl 2 hydroxypropoxy phenyl propane and polyvinil compounds such as divinylbenzene and divinylnaphthalene.

These monomers may be used either alone or as a mixture of two or more of them. Among the foregoing compounds, divinylbenzene, diallyl isophthalate, 1,3 benzenebis allylcarbonate , cis 1,2divinylcyclohexane, diallyl chlorendate, 2, 2 bis 4 acryloxy ethoxy phenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 methacryloxyethoxy phenyl propane, 2, 2 bis 4 acryloxyethoxy 3, 5 dibromophenyl propane, 2,2 bis 4 methacryloxyethoxy 3,5 dibromophenyl propane, and mixtures thereof are preferred. When a monomer contains a functional group such as OH, NCO, COOH, NH2 or epoxy even though it has only one radical polymerizable double bond per molecule, a monomer compound having a plurality of double bonds formed by intermolecular bonding of the above monomer through said functional group may be used alone or as a mixture. Examples of such monomer compounds include an adduct of 2 mol of l vinyl 4 hydroxybenzene with 1 mol of hexamethylene diisocyanate, an adduce cf 2.Fol of bisphenol A monoacrylate with 1 mol of xylylene diisocyanate, an adduct of 2 mol of methacrylic acid with 1 mol of 2,2 bis 4 glycidoxyphenyl propane, an adduct of 1 mol of 4 hydroxyphenyl methacrylate with 1 mol of glycidyl methacrylate, an adduct of 2 mol of vinylacetic acid with 1 mol of xylylenediamine, an adduct of 2 mol of 2 4 hydroxyethoxy phenyl 2 4 acryloxyethoxy phenyl propane with 1 mol of hexamethylene diisocyanate, an adduct of 2 mol of 2 4 hydroxyethoxy phenyl 2 4methacryloxy ethoxy phenyl propane with 1 mol of hexamethylene diisocyanate, an adduct of 2 mol of 2 4hydroxyethoxy 3,5 dibromophenyl 2 4 acryloxyethoxy 3,5dibromophenyl propane with 1 mol of hexamethylene diisocyanate, and an adduct of 2 mol of 2 4 hydroxyethoxy 3, 5 dibromophenyl 2 4 methacryloxyethoxy 3,5 dibromophenyl propane with 1 mol of hexamethylene diisocyanate.

An adduct of 2 mol of 2 4 hydroxyethoxy 3,5 dibromophenyl 2 4 methacryloxyethoxy 3,5 dibromophenyl propane with 1 mol of hexamethylene diisocyanate and mixtures thereof are preferred. Generally, a birefringence index will be increased when a resin contains a cyclic moiety such as an aromatic, cyclohexane, or heterocyclic ring. It is a characteristic feature of this invention, however, that the resin of the present invention has a remarkably low birefringence index as compared with those prepared by injection or compression molding, even when it has an above mentioned ring. This is because the resin of the present invention can be produced by cast polymerization. The resin of the present invention for use as a disc substrate must have a water absorption of 0.5 or below from the viewpoint of dimensional stability. Preferably, the water absorption should be 0.02 to 0.2 . The aromatic, cyclohexane, or heterocyclic ring in the resin has a remarkable effect of lowering water absorption, which is reduced in proportion to the number of such rings.For that puepose, a polyfunctional aliphatic monomer having a radical polymerizable double bond may be added to lower the water absorption to a desired value. Examples of such monomers are ethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , diethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , triethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , tetraethylene glycol bis allyl carbonate , ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate and neopentyl glycol dimethacrylate. Preferably, the resin of the present invention for use as a disc substrate should have a heat softening resistance of l500C or higher, because the disc must be exposed to a high temperature when irra a 5 ated with laser beams in information recording. The presence of a crosslinked moiety, i.e., the presence of a polyfunctional monomer has a remarkable effect of improving the heat softening resistance, which is improved in proportion to the density of crosslinking. If desired, a monofunctional monomer having a radical polymerizable double bond may be added to control the heat softening resistance.Examples of such monomers include styrene, vinyltoluene, benzyl acrylate, benzyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, a naphthyl acrylate, a naphthyl methacrylate,B naphthyl acrylate, B naphthyl methacrylate, phenyl acrylate, phenyl methacrylate and its halogen or alkylsubsituted derivatives, phenyl allyl carbonate, benzyl allyl carbonate, allyl benzoate, allyl naphthalenecarboxylate and its halogen substituted derivatives. In some cases, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride and hydroxyethyl acrylate may also be used. The raito of the monomer having at least two polymerizable double bonds used as the essential ingredient in the present invention in the copolymerization varies depending on optical and mechanical properties, but the quantity of the monomer used as the essential ingredient is not less than 1 by weight, preferably 5 , more preferably 10 . When this quantity is less than 1 by weight, a resin having a low water absorption and a high softening resistance can not be obtained. In some cases, especially when aliphtic monomer was used, the rasio is preferably more than 30 . The resin of the present invention is molded by using the aforementioned polyfunctional monomer as the essential ingredient and carrying out cast polymerization. Unlike injection or compression molding, solidification and polymerization are completed in a stationary state so that the orientation of the resulting resin is greatly improved and a resin having a very low birefringence index can be obtained. The polymerization may be carried out by any of conventional methods such as radical polymerization, such as heat or photopolymerization. Preferably, from 0.01 to 10 parts by weight of a polymerization initiator such as diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, dimyristyl peroxydicarbonate, tert. butyl peroxypivalate, lauroyl peroxide, tert. butyl peroxyisobutyrate, tert. butyl peroxyisopropyl carbonate, ditert. butyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, azobisisobutyronitrile or azobis tert. octane is mixed with 100 parts by weight of the aforementioned monomer or a mixture of the aforementioned various monomers. The resulting mixture is poured into a preformed mold and gradually heated to thereby complete the polymerization. If desired, the polymerization is suspended on its way to take the product in the form of a prepolymer out of the mold, and the polymerization of the prepolymer may be again carried out in the presence of the above polymerization initiator to complete the polymerization. The polymerization temperature and time vary depending on the types and the mixing ratio of the monomers and the type of the poly ization initiator, but it is preferred to complete the polymerization at a temperature of 40 to 1500C for one to 100 hr. The resin of the present invention may also produced by photopolymerization. From 0.01 to 10 parts by weight of a photosensitizer such as benzoin, benzoin methyl ether, benzoin ethyl ether, benzophenone, 2 hydroxy 2 methylpropiophenone, benzil dimethyl ketal, benzoin isopropyl ether, acetophenone, dimethoxyacetophenone, l chloro anthraquinone or 1,4 naphthoquinone may be mixed with 100 parts by weight of the aforementioned monomer or a mixture of them. The monomer or the monomer mixture is then irradiated with a sunlamp or mercury vapor lamp to effect polymerization. If desired, a polymerization initiator may be used together with the photosensitizer. In the molding of the resin of the present invention for disc substrate, additives such as antistatic agent, discoloration inhibitor, surface smoothing agent, ultraviolet light absorber and antioxidant may be added in addition to the aforementioned ingredients to increase the utility of the product. Examples of the antistatic agent include nonionic surfactants and quaternary ammonium salts. Examples of the discoloration inhibitor include triphenyl phosphine, triphenylantimony and triphenylarsenic. Examples of the surface smoothing agent include silicone compounds, fluorinecontaining surfactants and organic surfactants.Examples of the ultraviolet light absorber include 2 hydroxy 5 methylphenyl benzotrizole, 2 hydroxy 5 tert. butylphenyl benzotriazole, 2 3 5 di tert. butyl 2 hydroxyphenyl benzotriazole and 2 hydroxy 4 n octoxybenzophenone. Examples of the antioxidant include hindered phenols and hindered amines. A dye or a pigment may be added to the resin of the present invention to color it, so far as the transparency of the resin as disc substrate is not deteriorated. These additives may be added to the monomer or the monomer mixture before the beginning of the polymerization. Alternatively, they may be added to a prepolymer during the course of the polymerization. The resin of the present invention has a crosslinked structure and comprises,as its essential component, a polymer containing at least one ring selected from the group consisting of an aromatic ring, a cyclohexane ring and a heterocyclic ring as its repeating unit and hence it has low water absorption, good dimensional stability and good heat resistance. Thus it can be consistently used as information recording medium. Further, the resin of the present invention is essentially prepared by cast polymerization, so that there can be obtained a resin having low birefringence index suitable for use as a disc substrate. Thus the crystal orientation is very low and an information recording medium having desirable properties can be obtained. The following examples will further illustrate the present invention, though they are not to be construed as limiting the present invention in any way.
