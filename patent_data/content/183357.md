# OPTICAL FIBRE CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A male connector elements 28 has a path 35,37 for an optical fibre 52 which extends axially for most of the length of the element but ends in a radial termination 54 . A female connector element 1 has a cylindrical member with radial termination 8 of an optical fibre 4 which is to be connected to fibre 52 . Termination 54 is covered by a sleeve 43 and termination 8 is covered by a piston 11 when the elements are disconnected. The act of connection causes automatic uncovering and alignment Fig.2 of the terminations 8,54 ring seals carried by the sleeve and piston effecting wiping of the termination lenses during the uncovering.
