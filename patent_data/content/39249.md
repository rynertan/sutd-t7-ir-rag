# An electronic balance.

## Abstract
The weight W is weighed by measuring the current necessary in the coil 4 moving in the magnetic field of a yoke 2 to counteract the weight. The current is periodically switched between positive and negative directions at a rate which does not cause oscillation of the pan 3. A sensor 7 determines the position of the pan 3 and the output of the sensor controls the switching of the current to vary either the relative durations t₁ and t₂ or the relative magnitudes I₁ and I₂ of the positive and negative currents. The weight W is proportional to I₁t₁ I₂t₂ and is displayed at 15. Several variants of the switching, con trol and measurement circuits are described. The heat genera tion in the coil 4 may be kept constant or the extent of its variation reduced relative to that in known balances.
