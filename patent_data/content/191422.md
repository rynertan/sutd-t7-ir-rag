# ARTICLE SUPPLY APPARATUS

## Abstract
For transporting solid pharmaceutical products succes sively from a supply station to a processing station while they have been aligned in position, an article supply apparatus com prises a rotary transport drum supported for rotation in a plane inclined at an angle relative to a horizontal plane. The drum has its outer peripheral surface so tapered in one direction away from a drive shaft as to occupy a portion of the shape of a cone. The tapered outer peripheral surface of the drum is formed with a plurality of circumferentially equally spaced pockets so shaped and so sized as to accommodate the prod ucts therein. A hopper for receiving a batch of the pharmaceut ical product is rigidly mounted on the drum for rotation to gether therewith.
