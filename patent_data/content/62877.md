# Continuously variable V belt transmission.

## Abstract
A continuously variable V belt transmission comprises a V belt running over drive and driven pulleys 24,34 , each having an axially fixed conical disc 26 , axially movable conical disc 30 and a cylinder chamber 28 for moving the axially movable conical disc 30 . At least one of the pulleys has a compensation chamber 29 which is separated from the cylinder chamber 28 by a partition wall member 23 . The compensation chamber 29 is enclosed by the partition wall member 23 , cylinder wall 30a and trough 31 including an annular disc like portion 31a directed inwardly from the cylinder wall 30a . The trough 31 has a tubular portion 31b directed axially from the disc like portion 31a . A passage 92 is formed and is so directed that flow of fluid from an outlet port of a torque converter 12 is guided by the tubular portion toward the compensation chamber 29 .
