## Abstract
The modular hearing aid 12 utilizes a soft ear tip 14 which, when used with a molded vent adapter 21 , forms an ear piece which can be coupled to the sound tube 28 at the output port 24 of an In The Ear hearing aid. The ear tip 14 is perforated with an aperture 30 for delivery of sound to the auditory canal and a plurality of other apertures 34 disposed around the sound delivery aperture 30 provide venting from the auditory canal into the interior of the ear tip coupler 14 and through a vent port 26 in the adapter to an external vent 16 .
