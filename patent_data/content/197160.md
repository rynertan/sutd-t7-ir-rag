# METHOD OF MACHINING BY ELECTROEROSIVE WIRE CUT DISCHARGE.

## Abstract
A machining device by wire cut discharge which dis plays a machinable time T based upon a remaining wire electrode 2 . The length of a wire when a bobbin B1 is loaded and a speed for sending the wire are input through a manual input device 7 , and are stored in a memory 6 . A CPU 5 calculates a new lenght L of the remaining wire relying upon the length of wire when it loaded or the length L of the remaining wire by them and the speed V for sending the wire every after a predetermined period of time during the machining step S1 , and further calculates the machinable time T relying upon the newly calculated length L of the remaining wire and the speed V for sending the wire. The machinable time is displayed on a display 8 steps S2, S3 .
