## Description
The invention relates to rip saws incorporating feed mechanism whereby a timber workpiece can be driven along a fence towards a band saw blade. Rip saws are customarily provided with powered feed rollers for this purpose. The positions of the feed rollers and fence relative to the blade are each adjustable by means of a handwheel and screw. The feed rollers are biassed towards the fence by means of a spring or weights or hydraulically. This allows a certain amount of variation, perhaps 25mm in width of the workpiece fed. FR A 1072 127 Rennepont describes a feed mechanism comprising a roller rotated by an electric motor. The roller is rotatable with respect to an arm extending from a shaft located on the side of a fence remote from a blade, and biassed towards the fence by a spring. The feed mechanism is described in relation to a dedoubleur, which is a band saw. CH A 351391 Bründler shows a planing machine having a feed mechanism that has a roller urged by a torsion spring coiled around a shaft on which the arm of the roller is mounted and fastened at one end to a stop and at the other end to a collar locked to the shaft, but the rollers are included so as to drive the workpiece away from a fence. The problem is to allow a great variation in the width of the workpiece without the need to reposition the feed mechanism. A workpiece may be put through a machine a number of times, and reduced in width at each pass. The invention reduces the frequency at which it is necessary to adjust the position of the feed mechanism. The invention provides rip saw comprising a roller for driving a workpiece on a saw table along a fence towards a blade, power means for rotating the roller, an arm in relation to which the roller is rotatable, an upright shaft secured to the saw table on the side of the blade remote from the fence and on which upright shaft the arm is fast, and a spring coiled around the upright shaft, fastened at one end to an adjustable stop, at the other end to a collar locked to the upright shaft, and biassing the upright shaft to urge the roller towards the fence. The power means preferably comprises a chain drive from a motor to the roller via a double sprocket freely rotatable on the upright shaft. This makes it possible to gear down the rotational speed of the drive and avoid the use of a chain tensioner. The force of the spring makes the feed roller engage a wide workpiece strongly, and so increase its tractive effect. With particular reference to Figure 1, the saw comprises feed rollers 10 for driving a workpiece not shown along a fence 12 towards a blade 14. The section in Figure 3 shows in greater detail how an electric motor 16 rotates the rollers 10 through chain 18, 19 via a double sprocket 20 freely rotatable at the top of an upright shaft 22. The rollers 10 are secured on a shaft 24 which is rotatably journalled in an arm 26 and driven through a chain sprocket 28. The arm 26 is locked fast on the upright shaft 22, so the rollers 10 are rotated in relation to the arm 26. The shaft 22 is pivotable through about 90 , rotatably mounted in bushes in a machine casing at its base and centre, and surrounded at its lower part by a coil spring 30. The coil spring 30 is fastened at a lower end to an adjustable stop 32 on the machine casing whereby the tension of the spring may be adjusted, and at its upper end to a collar 34 which is locked fast on the upright shaft 22. Thus the coil spring 30 biasses the shaft 22 and the arm 26 anti clockwise as it would appear in Figure 2 so that the rollers 10 are urged towards the fence 12 from a position B towards a position A. Thus the rollers 10 drive the workpiece along the fence 12 and through the machine. The wider and or heavier the workpiece the greater the force applied by the coil spring 30 to move the workpiece towards the fence 12, and consequently the greater the tractive effect of the rollers 10.
