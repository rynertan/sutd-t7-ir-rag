# Target disc for ion implantation into semiconductors and method for cooling such a disc.

## Abstract
A rotating target ion implant apparatus is equipped with an arrangement for cooling the target. The cooling arrangement utilizes a pattern of air openings or passages 27a r and air fins 33a r . The air openings 27a r are positioned concentric to the disc hub 29 and function to both reduce the conductive cross section between the hub region and outer work region 31 of the disc 25 and permit air to pass from the implant side to the back surface thereof. The air fins 33a r are provided on the back surface of the disc 25 to draw air through the openings 27a r when rotating. Cooling is achieved by rotating the disc 25 in an atmosphere during the load unload cycle of operation. Reduction of the conductive cross section between work region 31 and hub 29 reduces heat transfer to the drive means 35 coupled to the hub 29 .
