# BENZALDEHYDE AND 4,6 0 BENZYLIDENE D GLUCOSE FOR ALLEVIATING PAIN

## Abstract
Benzaldehyde and 4,6 0 benzylidene D glucose have been found to have analgesic activity. It is believed that this analgesic activity results from the inhibition of enkephalinase. Therefore benzaldehyde and 4,6 0 benzylidene D glucose are also useful for inhibiting enkephalinase in humans.
