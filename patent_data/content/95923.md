# COMMUNICATIONS SCRAMBLING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
Scrambled communications signalling uses signals as transmitted and received that are coded by reorganisation of binary words representing original information signals. That reorganisation not only produces different sequences of blocks of binary words but also provides for variation of the lengths and numbers of such blocks via memori M100 M115 within each reorganisation. In addition the blocks are read out in reverse order to their storage, and the preferred organisation is via a logic type pseudo random generator that must be synchronised and seeded at both transmitter and receiver prior to any transmission.
