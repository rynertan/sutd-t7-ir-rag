## Description
PROCESS FOR PPEPARING ACRNTONITRILE POLYMER FI3E OF HOLLOW OR OPEN STRUCTURE This invention relates to a process for preparing an acrylonitrile polymer fiber of modified cross sectional shape. More particularly, this invention relates to such a process wherein a single phase fusion melt of acrylonitrile polymer and water is extruded through a spinnerette the orifices of which are partially blocked by solid inserts. Recent developments in the art of spinning acrylonitrile polymer fiber have led to a fusion melt spin ning procedure, see U.S Patent 4,163,770 issued August 7, 1979, to Harold Porosoff. In this procedure, an acrylonitrile polymer and water in proper proportions are heated to a temperature above the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure and under sufficient pressure to maintain water in liquid state. At appropriate temperature and pressure a homogeneous fusion melt of polymer and water will form at a temperature below the detericration ternparature of the polymer and at a temperature below which the polymer would normally melt with decomposition.In preferred embodiments, this fusion melt is extruded through a spinnerette directly into a steam pressurized solidificatIon zone maintained under conditions which prevent sheath core structure in the cross section of the nascent filament and enable stretching to provide orientation of the polymer molecules to be accompli shed while the extrudate remains within the solidlfica ti n one. This process provides a rapidly solidified extrudate composition which upon exit from the spinnerette shows n tendency towards stickiness and hugh conformity to the shapc of the spinnerette orifices throu3h which it is spun. Fibers having hollow or opcn crross sectional shape are desirable for a number of reason . Because of their structure such fibers have a higher extent of surface area than do conentional shaped fibers. This high surface aret consists of both external surface area and internal surface area of hollow and open structural modifications.This high surface area permits increased adsorption of water, dyes and other adsorbable materials. Increased water adsorp tiO l provides greater comfort in wearing fabrics made from such fiber. The hollow or open structure aIso provides greater bulk than conventional fiber of the same denier.Esthetic qualities such as handle or feel are also desirably faltered by the hollow or open structure and suitable structures can provide greater cover in fabric c onstructions than conventional structures of the same denier Fabrics constructed from the open structure fiber dry quicker than fabrics constructed from closed structure fiber because of their greater surface area. Thus, although the desirability of hollow and open structure fibers is generally recognized, suitable processes for preparing such Fiber have been diffi cult to provide and only limited amounts of fiber of hollow and open structures have Decome available. Spinnerettes useful in providing hollow and open stricture fiber are extremely difficult to construct and require extremely expensive techniques to construct. Spinnerettes useful in one type of fiber spinning process are not always useful in other typos of fiber spinning processes.Because of these restrictions very limited production of hollow and open structure fiber has been evidenced. This is especially true in the field of acrylonitrile polymer fiber where the previous spinning processes did not respond well to modifications for preparing hollow and open structure fiber. What is needed is a process for spinning hollow andQpen structure acrylonitrile polymer fiber which employs readily constructed spinnerettfs and enables wide vari2tions in the types of modified fiber structure provided. Such a provision would fulfill a lolg felt need and constitute a significant advance in the art. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing acrylonitrile polymer fiber which comprises eertrudilzg a homoseneous single phase fusion melt of acrylonitrile polymer and water through a spinnerette directly into a steam pressurized solidification zone maintained under conditions of saturation, tesllperature and pr ss ure which controls the release of water from the nascent extrudate and maintain the extrudate in plastic state and stretch said extrudate while it remains within the solidi fication zone to provide orientation of the polymer molecules characterized by employing a spinnerette the orifices of which have be n partially blocked by meons of a solid insert therein whereby hollow or open structure fibers are prol7idcd The process of the present invention provides acrylonitrile polymer fiber of infinite varieties of hollow and open structures. The spinnerette modifications necessary to provide hollow or open structure fiber is readily accomplished by means of removable solid inserts which partially bloc part of the orifice volume in accordance with the type of fiber structure desired. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figures 1 4 represent a first embodiment for preparing open structure fiber, Figures 5 9 represent a second embodiment for providing open structure fiber, and Figures 10 15 represent an embodiment for preparing hollow fibers. More specifically. Figure 1 represents a cross sectional view of a portion of a conventional spinnerette showing two adjacent spinning orifices and the counterbores associated therewith as well as top and bottom views thereof Figure 2 shows the orifices of Figure 1 modified by insertion of wire therein according to an embodiment df the present invention as well as top and bottom views thereof Figure 3 shows enlarged bottom views of the spin nerette orifices modified by wire inserts Figure 4 represents a phQ4 0siCrO5rap11 of cross sections of fiber spun according to the present invention using the modified orifices represent ed by Figure 2 Figure 5 represents a cross section of a portion of a spinnerette plate sho ing a single counterbore and orifice as well as top and bottom views thereof Figure 6 represents a side view of a typical insertion pin of the present invention as well as top and bottom views thereof Figure 7 represents a cross section of a single counterbore and orifice with insertion pin positioned therein as well as a top and bottom view thereof Figure 8 represents the bottom view of a number of shaped orifices having a variety of shaped pins inserted therein Figure 9 represents a photcsicrograph of cross sections spun in accordance with the present invention using the spinnerette modification represcnted in Figure 7 Figure 10 represents a cross section of a portion of a spinnerette plate showing a single counterbore a nd orifice as well as top and bottom views thereof Figure 11 represents a typical insertion pin of the present invention as well as top and bottom views thereof Figure 12 represents a cross section of a single counterbore and orifice with Insertion pin therein as well as top and bottom views thereof Figure 13 represents the bottom view of a number of shaped orifices having a variety of shaped pins inserted therein Figure 14 represents a photomicrograph of cross sections of fiber spun according to the present invention using the spinnerette modification represented by Figure 12 and Figure 15 represents a photograph of this holloz fiber and a control fiber with ends submerged in water with dye for tracing. In carrying out processing to provide the hollow or open structure acrylonitrile polymer fiber in accordance witty the present invention, a horogcncous single phase fusion melt of a fiber forming aerylonitrile polyner and water is prepared in accordance with conventional procedures This fusion melt is then extruded through a spinnerette assc bly which has been modified with solid inserts that bloc a portion of the orifice volume so as to provide a hollow or open structure in the resulting extrudate.Such extrusion is conducted in such a manner that the extrudate which is in the form cf filaments issues directly into a steam pressurized solidification zone maintained under cctions which prevent foliation of a sheath core structure within the solid polymer area ane minimize folmatiorl of a density gradient and voids therein. The steam will be mainta rXed under conditions of saturation, temperature and pressure which control the rate of release of water from the nascent extrudate and maintain the extrudate in plastic state.Such conditions are described in the art. hile the nascent extrudate remains in the solidification zone, it is subjected to orientation stretching at stretch ratios adequate to provide desirable textile properties in the fiber produced. Such stretching can be accomplished within the steam pressurized solidification zone because under the steam conditions maintained therein sufficient water remains within the extrudate to maintain the extrudate in plastic state. Stretching may be accomplished in one or more stages while within the solidification zone and can lead to fine denier filaments as well as highly desirable physical properties for textile applications. The acrylonitrile polymer water fusion melt when spun through a spinnerette directly into a solidfying medium solidifies rapidly without forming sticky surfaces and retains with high conformity the shape of the orifices without the need for any special provisions such as injection of secondary fluid to retain hollow structure. As a result, a variety o fiber shapes and hollow or open configurations can be employed in producing fiber having excellent conformity to the shape forming orifices including those providing hollow structures. In a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, a hydrophilic acrylonitrile polymer is employed as the fiber forming polymer. Such a polymer will contain acrylonitriAe units and will have hydrophilic moieties associated therewith. There are other techniques by which hydrophilic moieties can be associated with an acrylonitrile polymer. One method of introducing hydrophilic units into an acrylonitrile polymer composition is tc copolymerize acrylonitrile with a hydrophilic comonomer, to provide 2 copolymer containing at least 50 weight percent ofacrylonitrile units, from 1 to 10 weight percent of a hydrophilic monomer and any balance of one or more monomers copolymerizable with h acrylonitrile. Another method is to pol merize the acrylonitrile polymer composition in the presence of a redox initiator system that introduces acid groups at the polymer chain ends.Yet another method is to polymerize the acrylonitrile polymer composition in the presence of a pre formed hydrophilic polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol. Still another method is to hydrolyze a small portion of the acrylonitrile units of a pre formed acrylonitrile polymer to provide hydrophilic acrylic acid and or acrylamide units. Further, one can modify a portion of the acrylonitrile units of a pre formed acrylonirrile polymer by suitable reaction to provide hydrophilic g rbups, such as by reaction with ethylenediamine to provide imidazoline units. These and other methods known to those skilled in the art can be used alone or in combiliation to provide hydrophilic units associated with the acrylonitrile polymer composition use to prepare the fiber of the present invention. An acrylonitrile polymer cotiposition useful to provide the fiber in accordancc with the invention may by a single polFncr or a blend of compatible polymers so long as the composition provides a minimum of at least 50 weight percent acrylonitrile units and preferably has hydrophilic units associated therewith to achieve a transparent fiber. This transparc ncy is reflected in a dye intensity of at least 60 and a shade change due to hot wet processing of less than 25. Dye intensity is the reflectance of a dyed fiber of the present invention relative to the reflectance of a wet spun fiber of the same polymer dyed with the same amount of the same dye.Shade change due to hot wet processing is the change in reflectance of the dyed fiber after a hot wet processing step, such as oven drying the wet dyed fiber, compared to the air dried dyed fiber, Individua f compatible polymers in blends used need not contain the specified amounts of acrylonitrile units or hydrophilic moieties so long as the total blend composition provides the required amounts of such materials. By hydrophilic moieties are meant those portions of the acrylonitrile polymer composition that are hydrophilic and include such moieties as sulfonic acid groups, polyvinyl alcohol segments, repea ting comonomer units and the like.By associated therewith is meant that such hydrophilic units are present in the acrylonitrile polymer composition in a manner appropriate for the particularhydro philic moieties involved. Thus sulfonic acid groups may arise as end groups on polymer chains or as functional group on a comonomer polyvìnyl alcohol moieties may be present as part of a grafted polymer other hydrophilic moieties may arise as repeating units in a copoler prepared from, two or more monomers or as a result of hydrolyzing a suitable polymer they may also arise as a result of suitable reaction of a pre formed polymer they may arise as a compatible polymer blend and in such other methods as are knows to those skilled in the art, Thus, the terit associated therewith is intended to include the various manners in which hydrophilic moieties are present in the acrylonitrile polymer composition since no other terminology is appropriate to cover all the manners described. The amount of hydrophilic moieties in a given acrylonitrile composition will vary depending upon. many factors.The content of hydrophilic moieties will be influenced by the nature of the hydrophilic groups, the molecular weight of. the polymer, the content of acrylonitrile ln the polymer, the nature of the polymer composition, i.e. copolymer, graft blend, etc., the presence or absence of more than one type of hydrophilic moieties, processing conditions and other variables. Generally useful amounts of hydrophilic moieties are those which as monomer units comprise about 1 to 10 weight percent of the total polymer weight. Holvever, useful contents of hydrophilic moieties can readily be found by trial following the teachings herein as a guide. Suitable acrylonitrile polymers include homopolymers of acrylonitrile and copolymers of acrylonitrile and one or more of the follox1ing monomers. HYDROPHOBIC MONOiERS methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, methoxmethyl acrylate, beta chloroethyl acrylate and the corresponding esters of methacrylic acid and chioro acrylic acid vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride, vinyl bromide, vinylidene chloride, vinylidene bromide, allyl chloride, l chloro l bromoethylene methacrylonitrile, methyl vinyl ketone, vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl stearate, vinyl benzoate, N vinyl phthalimide, N vinyl succinimide, methylene malonic esters, itaconic esters, N vinyl carbazole, vinyl furan, alkyl vinyl ethers, diethyl citraconate, dimethyl mesaconate, styrene, dibromostyrene, vinyl naphthalene, 2 methyl 1 vinyl imidazole, 4 methyl l vinyl imidazole, 5 methyl l vinylimidazole and the like. HYDROPHILIC MONONERS Acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, alpha chloroacrylic acid, itaconic acid, vinyl sulfonic acid, styrene sulfonic acid, methallyl sulfonic acid, p methoxyallyl benzene sulfonic acid, acrylamidomethyipropane sulfonic acid, ethylene alpha ,ss dicarboxylic acids and their salts acrylamide, methacrylamide, dimethyl acrylamide, isopropyl acrylamide allyl alcohol 2 vinyl pyridine, 4 vinylpyridine, 2 methyl 5 vinylpyridine vinylpyrrolidone vinyl piperidone 1,2 dihydroxypropyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate 1 trimethylammonium 2 hydroxypropyl methacrylate methosulfate and the like. In preparing acrylonitrile polymers and copolymers it is desirable to employ redox systems such as sodium per persulfate sodium bisulfite to initiate and control the polymer zatìón. Such use results in sulfonic as end groups on the polymer formed. The proportion of sulfonic acid end groups in the polymer will vary with molecular eight of the polymer, higher proportions being present in polymers of low molecular weight These sulfonic acid end groups should be taken into account when determining the content of hydrophilic moieties in the acrylonitrile polymer composition used to provide the fiber in accordance with the present invention.Acrylonitrile polymer compositions containing sulfonic acid groups arising solely from the use of an appropriate redo system can beeffectively employed to provide fiber in accordance with the present invention When hydrophilic pre formedpolymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolnrone, po lyethylene oxide, polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid and the rive are to be used to provide the acrylonitrile polymer composition, it is desirable that such pre formed be added to the monomer compo sition to be polymerized to provide the ac rlonitrile units.Individual polymers of the composition may range in molecular weight from about 10,000 to 200,000 cr more so long as the com position provides fiber of desirable properties. Once a desired acrylonitrile polymer composltio n for forming fiber has been selected, it is next necessary to prepare a single phase homogeneous fusion melt of the composition and water A single phase fusion melt of acrylonitrile polymer composition and water results when suitable quantities of polymer composition and water are heated at elevated temperature and pressure sufficient to maintain water in liquid state. The amount of water necessary will vary depending upon the polymer composition employed For a given polymer composition, there will be a range of water contents that will provide the single phase fusion melt at operating tomperatur e and pressure. This can readily be determined from a phase diagram, which will also indicate the minimum melt temperature, i.e. the temperature at which the polymer begins to melt. Use of too low a water content or temperature will result in a separate phase of unmelted polymer. Use of too high a water content will result in a separate pins of polyr wate melt and an added phase of free water. Usually effective amounts of water are in the range of about 5 35 weight percent based on the total weight of polymer and water. lZ Jcn a hydro philic polymer composition is employed, it is generally preferable to use a water content in the lower half of this range, i.e. about 5 to 20 weight percent.The fusion melt should be obtained at a temperature safely below the eteriora tion or decomposition temperature of the polymer composition.Sufficient temperature and mixing should be employed to ensure that a homogeneous fusion melt is obtained. Useful temperatures are generally in the range of bout 10 2000C. The fusion melt is conveniently obtained in conJunz tion with spinning using a screw extruder coupled with a pur..p and spinnerette. A suitable procedure for melt spinning is described in U.S. Patent 3,991,153 issued November 9, 1976 to G. K. Klausner et al. Other types of nrelt spinning devices may be used such as a piston pump in conjunction with a spinnerette. In carrying out processing in accordance with the present invention, the homogeneous single phase fusion melt of acrylonitrile polymer composition and water is extruded through a spinnetette G rectly into a steam pressurized solidification zone maintained under conditions of saturation, temperature and pressure which control the release of water from the nascent extrudate and maintain the extrudate in plastic state. Under these conditions the extrudate is solidified and remains in a state such that orientation stretching can be accomplished while the extrudate remains in the solidification zone. Usually the solidification zone is pressurized with saturated steam at a temperature which is about 10 to 300C. below the minimum melt temperature of the polymer water cornposition. As the stretched extrudate emerges from the solidification zone, it enters atmospheric conditions. When the extrudate enters the atmosphere, required processing according to the present invention is complete but such additional conventional processing as may be desired can be performed. A preforred added processing stop in instances where a hydrophilic polymer composition is employed is to dry the extrudate in an ovc n under renditions specified by dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures. Generally, the dry bulb will be in the range of 120 1S00C. and the wet bulb will be sun the range of 60 100 C. This drying step i s preferably conducted before any uncontrolled or tensionless shrinkage of the extrudate has occurred. This drying step may be conducted on the extrudate in a frec to sh rink condition or under tension. Another preferred subsequent processingstep is that of relaxing the extrudate in steam under pressure so as to achieve shrinkage of about 5 402. This relaxing step should follow the drying step when such drying is effected. In order to obtain the open structure or hollow cross section in the resulting fiber it is necessary to employ a spinnerette that has orifices that w ill provide the desired configurations. A desirable procedure to obtain useful spinnerettes is to modify a conventional spinnerette plate as will next described. The conventional spinnerette plate will contain a plurality of orifices and each orifice will have a counterbore to enable operative back pressure to be achieved. Such spinnerettes should be of a material of construction useful in melt spinning applications. In one embodiment for providing fiber of open structure, wire is inserted into the orifices of the spinnerette orifices to block a suitable portion thereof and conta ct the orifice surface at some point. Wire of suitable construction material and size is provided for insertion to provid e the orifice modification desired. A number of techniques for providing the wire modification of the orifices is possible. In one procedure, a single strand of suitabiewire can be passed alternatively up and down through adjacent orifices until all orifices are modified and the wire ends are joined to secure the wire in position. Alternatively, such technique could be used jn modifying with one wire strand only the orifices in one orifice ru or in modifying only to adjacent orifices.Another technique involves providing the wire in prc cut and pre siiaped sections which then can be inserted through the counterbores to modify adjacent orifices xehile providing a secure fit. It is also possible to use more than one wire to bloc portions of one orifice and suitable securing procedures can involve multiple wires. Additional methods of securing the wires are possible and will readily occur to those skilled in the art. The wires used to block a part of the spinnerette orifice may be of different size and shape depending upon the nature of blocking and the resulting fiber cross section desired. The wire, of course, should be of suitable size to fit within the orifice and leave sufficient opening for operability of the fiber spilring process. Wire of round cross section is most common and is useful for many desirable modifications of fiber cross section. Additional shapes of useful wire cross sections include triangular, square, rectangular, elliptical, hexagonal, and the like as well as irregular shapes. Additional variations rise from use of orifices of crc sectional shpas other than round and placing different shaped wires therein. Combinations of several different shaped wires in an appropriate shaped orifice can lead to unusual fiber cross sections providing maximization of those desirable properties for which shaped fiber cross sections are desired. A A preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention is shown with respect to Figures 1 4. Figure 1 represents a cross sectional view of a portion of a conventional spinnerette plate showing two adjacent orifices and the counter bores associated therewith as well as top and bottom views of te orifices. Figure 2 represents the same view as Figure 1 except that the orifices have been modified with wire in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, a round cross section wire was employed which was bent to modify two orifices and was inserted in a manner in which the wire touches the wall of the orifice so as to provide an open structure fiber cross section.Spring tension in the bentwire keeps it securely placed in the two orifices. Figure 3 shots enlarged bottom views of the modified orifices and Figure 4 shows the er escent shaped cross sections of the fiber obtained. Another procedure for obtaining the open structure fiber cross sections is by the insertion of pins in the counterbore orifice combination of a conventional spinnerette plate. These pins are designed so that they are of solid construction and occupy a fixed position within the counterbore.The pins will be of such size as to enable extrusion Composi tion to floss through the counterbores at operative back pressure to the orifice. The pins will typically have an upper portion which fits into the counterbore and a lowe portion which fits into the orifice. The upper portion will be of suitable dimensions to assume a fixed position within the counterbore so that the lower portion remains suitably disposed in the orifice to provide the open structure fiber and enable adequate flow of extrusion composition through the counterbore and capillary.The lower portion of the pin will be of suitable dimensions to fit within the orifice and contact a portion of the wall thereof while providing a desirable relaticnsbip between fiber wall and open structure therein. A preferred embodiment of this type of modifation is shown with reference to Figures 5, 6 and 7. Figure 5 represents a cross section of a typical counterbore oriflce combination used in a typical spinnerette plate, as well as top and bottom views thereof. The counterbore has a greatly enlarged diameter relative to that of the orifice and converges to the orifice diameter with proper sloping. Figure 6 represents a side view of a preferred pin insert to provide open structure fibers when inserted within the counterbore capillary combination as well as top and bottom views thereof. As can be seen, the upper portion of the pin resembles a cylindrical rod which has been flattened along its length to provide clearance on two sides with the counterbore.The tcp of the upper portion is leveled while the bottom thereof is tapered at a greater angle than the taper of the counterhore to connect the orifice and thus provides clearance for the extrusion material. The bottom oration of the pin has a solid crcss sectional shape that conforms to the shape of the orifice on one face which is positioned so as to contact a portion of the wall of the orifice and has additional shape to provide desirable open area within the extrudate issuing from the orifice and provide suitable fiber cross sectional structure.In Figure 7, the insertion of the pin of Figure 6 in the counterbore capillary combination of Figure 5 is shown in cross section along with top and bottom views thereof.Clearance of the pin from the counterbore wall is shown in the top view and clearance between the tapers of the pin and counterbore are shown in the cross section In the bottom view the space in the orifice occupied by the pin insert is shown and the resulting cross sectional shape of the extrudate can be seen. In Figure 8 is shown a variety of orifice shapes with various shapes of the lower portion of the insert pin that can be used in the process of the invention. As can be seen, the pin shape may vary widely as may the orifice shape. Alto, it is possible to provide one or more open areas within the fiber by use of multiple projections as the lower portion of the pin insert. Figure 9 shows cross sections of fiber obtained by the process of the invention using in the counterbore capillary combinations pin inserts as shown in Figure 7. To provide hollow fibers, pin inserts resembling those described above are used except that the lower portion of the insert pin is centered in the orifice and does not contact the orifice wall. This is illustrated in Figures 10 15.Figure 10 represents a cross section of a typical counterbore capillary combination as well as top and bottom views thereof.Figure 11 represents a side view of a preferred pin insert to provide hollow fibers when inserted within the counterbore capillary combination as well as top and bottom views ther of. The upper portion of the pin insert is to that of Figure 6.The lower portion is similar to that of Figure 6 but is centered and does not have conformity to the orifice wall since it does not contact such wall. In Figure 12 the insertion of the pin of Figure 11 in the couxlterbore capillary combination ofFigure 10 is shown in cross section along with top and bottom views thereof. Clearance of the pin from the counterbore wall is shown in the top view and clearance between the tapers of the pin and counterbore are shown in the cross section. In the bottom view the space between the two inner circles represents the wall thickness of the extrudate as spun. In Figure 13 is shown a variety of orifice shape with various shapes of the lower portion of the insert pin that can be used in providing hollow fibers. As can be seen the pin shape can vary widely as well as can the orifice shape. Also, it is possible to provide one or more hollows within the fiber by use of multiple projections as the lower portion of the pin insert. Figure 14 represents a photomicrograph of fibers spun by the process of the invention using the pin modification shown Figure 12, showing the hollow structure of fiber ends. Figure 15 shows the greater wicking tendencies of Iiollo fibers comparied to solid fibers. The invention is more fully illustrated in the examples which follow wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLE 1 A conventional spinnerette plate having a plurality of orifices of 20 micron diameter was modified as shown inFigure 2 with 150 micron diameter wire resulting in free area remaining in the individual holes of about 13, 740 square microns. Modification was effected by cutting short lengths of the wire1 about 1 inch, and feeding the ends through adjacent orifices from the counterbore side. The wire was then pulled tight which conformed the wire to the counterb orc, cut to approximate length and filed to fit flush to the capillary exit. An acrylonitrile polymer of the following composition was employed Onto a pre formed polyvinyl alcohol Elvanol 71 306 was grafted suitable components to provide a polymer composition of Acrylonitrile 85 Methyl methacrylate 11.9 Polyvinyl alcohol 3.0 Acrylamidomethtlpropane sulfonic acid 0.1 The polymer had a kinematic molecular weight of 42,000.Kinematic molecular weight J is obtained from the relation ship 1 A Mk wherein is the average effluent time in seconds for a solution of 1 Gram of the polymer in 100 milliliters of 50 weight percent aqueous sodium thiocyanate solvent at 4000. multiplied by the viscometer factor and A is the solution factor derived from a polymer of knon molecular weight. The polymer, 86 parts, and water, 14 parts, were prepared as a fusion melt in an extruder at 16000. and autogenous pressure and extruded through a spinnerette plate prepared as described above. Extrusion was directly into a steam pressurized solidification chamber maintained at 13 pounds per square inch gauge with saturated steam and stretching was accomplished in the solidlfication chamber at a stretch ratio of 3.1 in a first stage and 8.3 in a second stage for a total stretch ratio of 25.7. The resulting fiber of about 5 denier per 4 lament had a cross sectlon l shape as shc n inFigure 4, which shape is termed crescent shaped. EXAMPLE 2 A conventional spinnerette plate having a plurality of orifices of 200 micron diameter was fitted with insert pins as shown in Figure 7. Each pin was 175 microns in diameter resulting in free area remaining in the individual capillaries of about 7,363 square microns. The acrylonitrile polymer composition described inExample 1 was employed. A mixture of 83 parts of the polymer, 17 parts water and 0.25 parts of a conventional glycol stearate type lubricant was converted into a fusion melt in an extruder at 17500. and autogenous pressure and extruded through the spinnerette plate modified as described above. Extrusion was directly into a steam pressurized solidification chamber maintained at 11 pounds per square inch gauge with saturated steam. The filaments were stretched at a stretch ratio of 3 while in the solidification zone to give a fiber of abou t 40 denier per filament that had cross sectional shape as shown in Figure 9 which shape is termed crescent shaped. EXAMPLE 3 A conventional spinnerette plate having a plurality of orifices of 300 micron diameter was fitted with insert pins as shown in Figure 12. Each pin was 175 micron in diameter resulting in free area remaining in the individual capillaries of about 46,633 square microns. Acrylonitrile polymer of the composition of that ofExample 1 but of kir.ematic molecular weight of 40,000 2S employed. A mixture of 84.6 parts polymer, 15.4 parts water and 0.25 parts of a conventional glycol stearate type lubricant was converted to a fusion melt in an extruder at 1670C. and autogenous pressure ana.etruded through the spinnerette plate prepared as described above directly into a ste pressurized solidification chamber maintained at 13 pcunds per square inch gauge with saturated steam. The resulting filaments were stretched while in the solidification chamber at a stretch ratio of 9.2 in a first stage and 4 in second stage of give a fiber of about 6.5 denier per filament. The fiber was dried at 1390C. dry bulb and 74by. wet bulb and steam relaxed at 1160C. The final denier fiber obtained was hollow as shown in Figure 14. When ends of this fiber were submerged in water containing dye, water wicks up above the water surface for 4 inches. When ends of a comparable solid fiber were submerged in the same dye water composition, no wicking was observed.This is shown in Figure 15.
