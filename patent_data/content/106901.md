## Description
TITLE Sulfur Modified Polytetramethylene Ether Glycols, A Method for Preparing Them, and Polyurethanes Prepared TherefromDESCRIPTIONTechnical Field This invention relates to polytetramethylene ether glycol PTMEG , which has been modified so that it contains sulfur containing moieties in its polymer chain. It is more particularly directed to such aPTMEG modified to contain dehydrated ss,ss dihydroxyalkyl sulfide HAS moieties in its chain. The invention also relates to a method of making the modified PTMEG s, to their use as stabilizers against the degradation the polyether chain, and to polyurethanes made with them.Background and Summary of the Invention Polyurethanes have been known and used for many years, and the basic general chemistry for their preparation, the reaction of a polyol, a polyisocyanate and a chain extender, is fully documented. A polyol frequently used for this purpose isPTMEG, which is well known to be degraded by exposure to oxygen, light and heat. It has been the general practice to guard against this degradation by blending with the PTMEG an external stabilizer such as a phenolic, an amine or a sulfur compound. It has now been found, according to the invention, that the stabilization can be more effectively and efficiently achieved if the PTMEG is modified so that it contains in its chain 1 25 , by weight, preferably 3 15 , even more preferably 4 10 , of moieties represented by the structure EMI2.1 where R is hydrogen, an alkyl radi cal of 1 3 carbon atoms or phenyl, and the oxygen atom is linked to a hydrogen atom or a carbon atom the modified PTMEG having an oxygen sulfur atom ratio of 3 1 or greater. It has been found, according to the invention, that the stabilization against degradation can also be achieved if unmodified PTMEG to be used is physically blended with about 0.4 20 , by weight, of the modified PTMEG. In addition, the method for preparing the modified PTMEG of the invention can be used to increase the molecular weight of PTDIEG by coupling polymer chain segments with HAS moieties. It has also been found that PTMEG modified according to the invention shows significantly better resistance to acid catalyzed depolymerization and to oxidative degradation at high temperatures than unmodified PTMEG.Detailed Description of the Invention The modified PTMEG of the invention is made by catalytically reacting a PTSEG with an HAS. The PTMEG used can be any of those commercially available, or can be prepared by any of the well known methods of catalytically polymerizing tetrahydrofuran. Preferably, the PTMEG has a number average molecular weight of 500 6000, more preferably 650 3000. Number average molecular weight is determined by first determining the hydroxyl number of the sample by titrating it with acetic anhydride according to ASTM D 1638 and then converting this number to number average molecular weight according to the formula 56,000 X n Molecular weight hydroxyl number where n is the hydroxyl functionality of the sample The HAS used is represented by the structureEMI3.1 where R is hydrogen, an alkyl radi cal of 1 3 carbon atoms, or phenyl. The HAS preferred for use is 6,ss dihydroxy ethyl sulfide. Any such HAS not available in the marketplace can be made by the well known reaction of hydrogen sulfide and an alkylene oxide. The preparative reaction is conducted in a mixture of PTMEG and HAS. The relative amounts ofHAS and PTMEG used are dictated by the weight of HAS moieties desired in the product. These amounts can be easily calculated using the principles of stoichiometry.In general, one uses 0.5 6 moles of HAS for each mole of PTMEG, preferably 1 2 moles. The catalyst used can be any heterogeneous or homogeneous acid catalyst stronger than H3PO4. The catalyst is preferably an alkyl or aryl sulfonic acid, even more preferably one of the strongly acidic cationic ion exchange resins bearing SO3H groups, insoluble in the reaction medium. Insoluble means that the amount of resin which dissolves in the medium under reaction conditions will give the modified PTMEG product an acid number of no greater than 0.05 mg of KOH per gram. The nature of the backbone of the resin is unimportant. The most common of the commercially available resins of this type have backbones which are of the polystyrene type, but resins having other backbones can be used. Preferred among the polystyrene type resins, and preferred for this use according to the invention, is one sold by the Rohm Haas Company of Philadelphia,PA as Amberlysts XN 1010. This macroreticular resin has a cation exchange capacity of 3.1 milliequivalents per gram, a surface area of 450 square meters per gram, a porosity of 41 , and a mean pore diameter of 0.005 micron. The catalyst is used at a concentration of 0.1 10 , by weight of the PTMEG, preferably 2 5 . The preparation is begun by placing the reactants and catalyst in a vessel and bringing the resulting mixture to a temperature of 130 1700C, preferably about 1500C, and holding it at that temperature, with stirring, until the HAS has been consumed, as shown by periodic sampling and analysis by gas chromatography. The water formed by the reaction can be removed from the reaction mass by vacuum distillation or by sweeping the reaction zone with an inert gas such as nitrogen. Preferably, the water is removed as a water hydrocarbon azeotrope, even more preferably as a water toluene azeotrope. The hydrocarbon can then be separated from the azeotrope by condensation in a suitable trap and can be recycled to the reaction mass.When this procedure is used, the temperature of the reaction mass can easily be held within the desired range by adjusting the concentration of toluene. When the PTMEG HAS reaction is finished, heating is stopped, the catalyst is filtered off if a heterogeneous catalyst is used and the remaining material is stripped of residual volatiles. The resulting product is a viscous liquid having a number average molecular weight of 500 10,000, preferably 800 5000, and an oxygen sulfur atom ratio of 3 1 or greater, preferably 5 60 1. Molecular weight can be varied by simply allowing the reaction to proceed until the desired molecular weight is reached. The blends of unmodified PTMEG and PTMEG modified according to the invention can be made by simply mixing them in amounts which will give a mixture containing 0.4 20 , by weight, of the modified PTMEG. A polyurethane can be prepared from a modified PTMEG of the invention, or from a modified unmodified blend, by reacting it with an organic polyisocyanate and an aliphatic polyol or polyamine chain extender, as is well known in the art. The polyisocyanates used in preparing the polyurethanes can be any of the aliphatic or aromatic polyisocyanates ordinarily used to prepare polyurethanes. Polyisocyanate means any compound bearing two or more NCO radicals. Illustrative are 2,4 toluene diisocyanate 2,6 toluene diisocyanate hexamethylene 1,6 diisocyanate tetramethylene 1,4 diisocyanate cyclohexane 1,4 diisocyanate naphthalene 1,5 diisocyanate diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate xylylene diisocyanate hexahydro xylylene diisocyanate dicyclohexylmethane 4 , 4 diisocyanate 1, 4 benzene diisocyanate 3,3 dimethoxy 4,4 diphenyl diisocyanate m phenylene diisocyanate isophorone diisocyanate polymethylene polyphenyl i socyanate 4,4 biphenylene diisocyanate 4 isocyanatocyclohexyl 4 isocyanatophenyl methane p isocyanatomethyl phenyl isocyanate.Mixtures of isocyanates can also be used. The isocyanates preferred for use because of the desirable properties they confer on the polyurethane products are diphenylmethane 4,4 diisocyanate and the toluene diisocyanates. The chain extenders used in preparing the polyurethanes can be any of the aliphatic polyols, or any of the aliphatic or aromatic polyamines ordinarily used to prepare polyurethanes. Illustrative of the aliphatic polyols which can be used as chain extenders are 1,4 butanediol ethylene glycol 1,6 hexanediol glycerine trimethylolpropane pentaerythritol 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol phenyl diethanolamineDiols like hydroquinone bis hydroxyethyl ether, tetra chlorohydroquinone 1,4 bis ss hydroxyethyl ether and tetrachlorohydroquinone 1,4 bis ss hydroxyethyl sulfide, even though they contain aromatic rings, are considered to be aliphatic polyols for purposes of the invention. Aliphatic diols of 2 10 carbon atoms are preferred. Especially preferred is 1,4 butanediol.Mixtures of diols can also be used. Illustrative of the polyamines which can be used as chain extenders are p,p methylene dianiline and complexes thereof with alkali metal chlorides, bromides, iodides, nitrites and nitrates. 4,4 methylene bis 2 chloroaniline dichlorobenzidine piperazine 2 methylpiperazine oxydianiline hydrazine ethylenediamine hexamethylenediamine xylylenediamine bis p aminocyclohexyl methane dimethyl ester of 4,4 methylenedianthranilic acid p phenylenediamine m phenylenediamine 4,4 methylene bis 2 methoxyaniline 4,4 methylene bis N methylaniline 2,4 toluenediamine 2, 6 toluenediamine benzidine 3,4 dimethylbenzidine 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine dianisidine 1,3 propanediol bis p aminobenzoate isophorone di amine 1,2 bis 2 aminophenylthio ethane. The amines preferred for use are 4,4 methylene bis 2 chloroaniline , 1,3 propanediol bis p aminobenzoate and p,p methylenedianiline and complexes thereof with alkali metal chlorides, bromides, iodides, nitrites and nitrates. Mixtures of amines can also be used. The polyurethanes can be prepared in two steps, the first of which is conducted under nitrogen at ambient pressure to prevent oxidation of the reactants and product, and to prevent exposure of the reaction mass to atmospheric moisture. In the first step, the modified PTMEG starting material is dried by heating it at a temperature of 80 1000C under vacuum, and is then held at 60 1250C, preferably about 70 900C, while a stoichiometric excess, preferably twofold to tenfold, of organic polyisocyanate is added, with stirring. The actual amount of isocyanate used depends on the molecular weight of the modified PTMEG used, as is well known in the art.The reaction mass is held for about 1 4 hours at 60 1250C, with stirring, and the free isocyanate content of the mass is then determined by titrating it with di n butylamine, as described in Analytic Chemistry of the Polyurethanes,Volume XVI, Part III, D. J. David and H. B. Staley,Wiley Interscience, 1969, pages 357 359. In the second step, an amount of polyamine or polyol chain extender calculated to give an isocyanate hydroxyl or amine mole ratio of about 0.91.1 to 1 in the reaction mass, preferably 1 1.05 1, is degassed at about 30 1200C and 1330 5330 Pa 10 50 mmHg pressure and quickly added to the reaction mass. A conventional curing catalyst can be added at this point if desired. Illustrative of catalysts which can be used are dibutyltin dilaurate and stannous octoate. The catalyst can be added to the reaction mass to give a concentration of about 0.001 0.1 , by weight, preferably about 0.01 . The reaction mass is held with stirring at 60 130 C until it is homogeneous, which normally takes 1 5 minutes. The mass is then poured into molds, preferably preheated to 100 1200C, and then cured at about 100 1200C at a pressure of 1700 2500 kPa for from 5 minutes to several hours. The casting is then cooled, removed from the mold, aged for about one week at ambient temperature, and is then ready for use. The polyurethanes can also be made by reaction injection and liquid injection molding techniques, whereby the starting materials are simultaneously injected and mixed in a mold, preferably together with a conventional polyurethane catalyst, and then subjected to pressures ranging from ambient to several million pascals and temperatures ranging from ambient to 1500C.Use of a foaming agent such as a fluorocarbon or water is optional.BEST MODE In the following example, all parts are by weight. The following were added to a reaction vessel fitted with a reflux condenser and a Dean Stark trap PTMEG Mn 1000 100 parts ss,ss dihydroxyethyl sulfide 12.2 parts Toluene 50 parts Amberlysts XN 1010 4 partsThe resulting mixture was heated to and held at reflux temperature for four hours, with stirring, while water was continuously removed from the reaction zone as the water toluene azeotrope.
