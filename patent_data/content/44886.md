# Machine tool with automatic tool change function.

## Abstract
In a machine tool with an automatic tool change func tion, a rotatable tool spindle 11 carries a movable key 65 engageable with a key way 18 formed on a tool T . A tool changing arm 13 , serving as a tool support device, friction rotatably supports at least one tool T for selec tively inserting and removing same into and from the tool spindle 11 . When a tool change operation is to be per formed, rotation of the spindle 11 is changed into a predetermined speed permitting key engagement. A de tecting device is provided for detecting movement of the movable key 65 to confirm engagement of the movable key 65 with the key way 18 of the tool T . A clamp device 21 23 clamps the tool T inserted into the spindle 11 in response to the detecting device. After the tool T is clamped on the spindle 11 , rotation of the spindle 11 is changed into a machining speed. A confirming device 33, 34 is provided for confirming that the spindle 11 is reached at a predetermined angular position during rotation thereof. The tool change arm 13 is operated to remove the tool T from the spindle 11 in response to the confirming device 33, 34 .
