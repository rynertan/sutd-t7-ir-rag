# Seed dispensing mechanisms.

## Abstract
These mechanisms for a precision row crop planter employ a pressure differential to cause seeds to be held to a series of seed apertures in a rotary disc 18 . The disc is of stainless steel of very thin gauge whereby the disc deforms under the pressure differential to provide a degree of self sealing. The apertures 40, 42, 44 in the disc are formed by chemical etching. A singulator mechanism 20 for removing excess seeds from the apertures comprises singulator members on opposite sides of the row of apertures and presenting a curved profile to the seeds and defining a throat of which the width can be adjusted by a single knob 72 through a high ratio adjustment mechanism.
