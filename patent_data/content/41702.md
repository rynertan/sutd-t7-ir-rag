## Description
APPARATUS FOR CULTURING MICROORGANISMS BY AERATIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an apparatus for culturing microorganisms by aeration, and more particularly to an apparatus for aerobically culturing miroorganisms by aeration with an oxygen enriched gas on a large scale.The term oxygen enriched gas used herein includes pure oxygen. In culturing microorganisms by aeration, carbon dioxide gas is produced at the propagation of microorganisms. In the conventional culturing by air blowing, the concentration of microorganism cells is low in the culture medium, and carbon dioxide gas is produced at a low rate. Thus, the carbon dioxide gas can be removed together with a large volume of effluent air, and the influence of carbon dioxide gas upon the propagation of microorganisms is not so serious except for a special case.However, when microorganisms are cultured at an elevated concentration of microorganism cells in the culture medium with an oxygen enriched gas, carbon dioxide is produced at a high rate. Furthermore, enormous energy is required for the preparation of oxygen enriched gas, and thus oxygen utilization of oxygen enriched gas to be led to the fermentor must be increased to a maximum. Consequently, a gas liquid contactor with good efficiency is used to reduce the rate of oxygen enriched gas to be led to the ferment or or the effluent gas from the ferment or is recycled. However, if the oxygen utilization is increased without removing carbon dioxide gas from the effluent gas, the carbon dioxide gas is more and more accumulated in the fermentor.Thus, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the culture medium is increased, directly giving an adverse effect upon the propagation of microorganisms.Furthermore, the oxygen partial pressure is so lowered that the oxygen supply becomes short. Thus, in aerobically culturing microorganisms in a fermentor by aeration with an oxygen enriched gas, it is desirable to increase the oxygen utilization of oxygen enriched gas and to effectively remove the carbon dioxide gas produced during the culturing at the same time. In the conventional apparatus for aerobically culturing microorganisms in a ferment or by aeration with an oxygen enriched gas produced in an oxygen production unit, wherein a carbon dioxide removing unit is provided in a system for recycling an effluent gas from the fermentor to the fermentor, it has been proposed to provide an oxygen production unit by water electrolysis, the oxygen gas generated therein being led to the fermentor, and to provide a carbon dioxide removing unit for removing the carbon dioxide from the effluent gas by an aqueous caustic soda solution Japanese PatentPublication No. 6392 71 , where the oxygen production cost is high in the oxygen production unit by water electrolysis, and thus the apparatus is not used when a high rate of oxygen is required. Furthermore, no cooling medium of low temperature can be obtained in the apparatus.On the other hand, the carbon dioxideremoving unit by use of an aqueous caustic soda solution requires a large amount of caustic soda and water for removing a high rate of carbon dioxide produced during the culturing, and also a large amount of the resulting aqueous sodium carbonate solution must be treated.When sodium carbonate is recovered as a by product, a concentrating unit is additionally required, making the entire operation of the apparatus complicated. As described above, any practical apparatus for culturing microorganisms by aeration on a large scale with a satisfactory effect, which is based on the introduction of an oxygen enriched gas produced in an oxygen product ion unit into a ferment or to aerobically culture microorganisms and provision of a carbon dioxide removing unit in a system for recycling an effluent gas from the fermentor to the fermentor, has not been realized yet.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for efficiently culturing microorganisms by aeration with an oxygen enriched gas on a large scale, which can increase utilization of oxygen introduced into a fermentor by a simple means, and can continuously and satisfactorily separate and remove carbon dioxide produced in the ferment or to prevent various troubles due to accumulated carbon dioxide. The present invention provides an apparatus for culturing microorganisms by aeration, which comprises a fermentor for aerobically culturing microorganisms, an oxygen production unit for producing an oxygen enriched gas, a carbon dioxide removing unit for separating and removing carbon dioxide produced during fermentation from an effluent gas from the ferment or and recycling the effluent gas free from the carbon dioxide to the ferment or, the fermentor and the carbon dioxide removing unit being connected to each other in a loop, the oxygen production unit being of cryogenic separation type and being connected to the carbon dioxide removing unit at the inlet and the carbon dioxide recovering unit being of heat exchange type of directly heat exchanging the effluent gas from the fermentor with liquid oxygen produced in the oxygen production unit and of indirectly heat exchanging the effluent gas with liquid nitrogen produced in the oxygen production unit, thereby separating and removing carbon dioxide from the effluent gas by solidification, and recycling the recovered oxygen to the fermentor. The present invention will be described in detail below, referring to one embodiment shown in the accompanying drawing.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Figure is a schematic flowdiagram showing one embodiment of the present invention. PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION In Figure, fermentor 1 is provided with cylindrical perforated trays 2 in vertical alignment on different levels to conduct effective gas liquid contact of an oxygen enriched gas introduced into the fermentor with a culture medium in the fermentor. Oxygen production unit 3 of cyogenic separation type is provided to supply oxygen necessary for propagation of microorganism cells in fermentor 1, and is connected to carbon dioxideremoving unit 5 through conduit 4 to lead liquid oxygen produced in the oxygen production unit to the carbon dioxide removing unit. On the other hand, effluent gas conduit 6 is provided at the top of ferment or 1 and connected to carbon dioxide removing unit 5 through recycling blower 7 to lead an effluent gas from the fermentor to the carbon dioxide removing unit. In carbon dioxide removing unit 5, device 8, for example, an ejector is provided at the inlet and a baffle plate against the ejector at the inside for effectively contacting the liquid oxygen introduced from oxygen production unit 5 through conduit 4 with the effluent gas introduced from the top of fermentor 1 through effluent gas conduit 6 to conduct heat exchange. Carbon dioxide removing unit 5 is connected to fermentor 2 through conduit 9 to lead the oxygen gas evaporated in the unit and also the oxygen gas recovered from the effluent gas to fermentor 1.Furthermore, carbon dioxide removing unit 5 is provided with discharge conduit 10 at the bottom of the unit to discharge solidified carbon dioxide separated and removed from the effluent gas. Furthermore, supply conduit 11 for supplying a culture medium necessary for culturing microorganisms and withdrawal conduit 12 for withdrawing the culture medium are provided at an appropriate level at fermentor 1. Furthermore, fermentor 1 is provided with cooler 13 for removing the heat generated during the culturing, and supply conduit 14 and discharge conduit 15 for cooling water. In addition, instruments for measuring temperature, pressure, liquid level, pH and dissolved oxygen, and devices and conduits for washing, sterilization, inoculation, acid and alkali supply, and defoaming are provided in the apparatus for culturing microorganisms, though not shown on the drawing. Flow and function of the present apparatus as shown in Figure will be described below. The liquid oxygen produced in oxygen production unit of cryogenic separation system is supplied to carbon dioxide removing unit 5 through conduit 4, and the oxygen gas evaporated in unit 5 is then injected into ferment or 1 at the bottom through conduit 9. Cylindrical perforated trays 2 are provided in vertical alignment on different levels in fermentor 1, and the injected oxygen is finely dispersed into the culture medium to undergo effective gas liquid contact with the culture medium. Most of the oxygen injected into the culture medium is consumed by microorganisms in the culture medium while it goes upwards through the culture medium, and at the same time converted to substantially an equimolar amount of carbon dioxide.The carbon dioxide thus produced arrives at the upper surface of the culture medium charged in fermentor 1, together with the unconsumed oxygen, and discharged to the outside of ferment or 1 through discharge gas conduit 6. In the culturing by aeration with oxygenenriched gas the production of oxygen enriched gas is so expensive that it is necessary to increase oxygen utilization to a maximum. Thus, a gas liquid contactor with high oxygen transfer efficiency must be used for the fermentor and the effluent gas must be recycled. However, an increase in oxygen utilization in the culturing by aeration with oxygen enriched gas reduces a flow rate of effluent gas to be discharged to the outside of fermentor 1 and consequently also reduces a rate of carbon dioxide entrained in the effluent gas.Thus, carbon dioxide is inevitably accumulated at a high concentration in the culture medium. The concentration of carbon dioxide accumulated in a culture medium depends upon culturing conditions, for example, kind of strains, concentration of microorganism, concentration of oxygen in aeration gas, aeration rate, etc. Carbon dioxlde, when accumulates at a high concentration in a culture medium, gives an adverse effect upon the propagation of microorganisms, and thus the formed carbon dioxide must be removed. According to the present invention, the effluent gas discharged from fermentor 1 at the top is led to carbon dioxide removing unit 5 through effluent gas conduit 6 and brought in contact with the liquid oxygen produced in oxygen production unit 3 of cryogenic separation type to separate and remove carbon dioxide from the effluent gas by solidification. The solidifying point of carbon dioxide gas is 56.60C, and thus carbon dioxide gas can be solidified by cooling it below the solidifying point. In the production of oxygen at a high rate, an oxygen production unit of cryogenic separation type is used, and can readily produce the necessary amount of oxygen for fermentor 1 and also the necessary amount of a cooling medium for removing the carbon dioxide produced during the culturing, when combined with an aeration fermentor of large scale according to the present invention. Carbon dioxide can be separated and removed from the effluent gas in carbon dioxide removing unit 5 in this manner, and the recovered oxygen enriched gas is recycled to fermentor 1 through conduit 9, together with the oxygen gas evaporated from the liquid oxygen from oxygen production unit 3. The solidified carbon dioxide separated and removed from the effluent gas in carbon dioxide removing unit 5 at the same time is discharged to the outside from discharge conduit 10. When a cooling rate necessary for solidifying carbon dioxide in the effluent gas cannot be obtained only from the liquid oxygen produced in oxygen production unit 3 of cryogenic separation type, carbon dioxidereducing unit 10 is indirectly cooled by liquid nitrogen produced in oxygen production unit 3 at the same time.Furthermore, it is also possible to incorporate a cooling device based on compression and adiatatic expansion of effluent gas itself in carbon dioxide removing unit 5.Furthermore, it is possible to utilize the coldness of solidified carbon dioxide discharged from carbon dioxide removing unit 5 to remove the heat generated during the culturing. The present invention will be described below, referring to Example.Example Microorganisms were cultured in an apparatus as shown in Figure under the following conditions Volume of culture medium charged into 1,000 m3 ferment or Concentration of microorganism cells 100 kg m3 Oxygen consumption rate per unit weight of culture medium 4 moles kg.cell.hr Respiratory quotient 1 mole C02 mole O2 Oxygen utilization through fermentor 60 Culturing temperature 300C Total oxygen consumption rate through 3 fermentor 9 x 10 m hr Total oxygen rate to fermentor 15 old3 m3 hr Total product C02 rate through fermentor 9x103 m3 hr Total effluent gas rate 15 x 103 m3 hr Non utilized oxygen rate in effluent gas 6x103 m3 hr 40 15 x lO m3 hr of the effluent gas discharged from the fermentor was cooled from the culturing temperature of 300C to about 800C under one atmosphere to solidify carbon dioxide in the effluent gas. The necessary cooling requirement for solidifying carbon dioxide was about 106 kcal hr, which could be satisfied by the latent heat of vaporization of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced in oxygen production unit of cryogenic separation type having a capacity of producing oxygen at the necessary rate for the culturing. That is, the cooling requirement could be satisfied by the latent heat of vaporization of the liquid oxygen having a rate equal to the total oxygen consumption rate through 6 fermentor, i.e. 0.65 x 105 keal hr and the latent heat of vaporization of liquid nitrogen produced at the same time in the oxygen production unit, 2 x 106 kcal hr.That is, total coldness obtainable from the liquid oxygen and the liquid nitrogen amounted to about 2.65 x 106 kcal hr, and was sufficient for cooling the effluent gas from the fermentor from 300C to 800 C. In the present invention, the effluent gas from the fermentor was heat exchanged directly with liquid oxygen and indirectly with liquid nitrogen efficiently in the carbon dioxide removing unit of simple structure without any additional energy, except that only a blower was required for supplying the effluent gas from the fermentor to the carbon dioxide removing unit, as shown in Figure. The effects of the present invention will be given below in comparison with the conventional apparatuses for aerobically culturing microorganisms by aeration with oxygen enriched gas.Comparative Example 1 Microorganisms were cultured under the same culturing conditions as in Example except that no carbon dioxide removing unit was used. That is, the effluent gas from the ferment or was discharged to the atmosphere directly. 6 x 103 m3 hr of the oxygen gas non utilized through the fermentor was not recovered in this case, and thus the oxygen gas had to be additionally produced at a rate corresponding to the rate of the unrecovered oxygen. According to the present invent ion, the amount of oxygen to be actually supplied to the ferment or can be 40 reduced, as compared with the case of not recovering the non utilized oxygen gas.Comparative Example 2 Microorganisms were cultured under the same culturing conditions as in Example, except that the carbon dioxide was removed from the effluent gas from the fermentor by absorption with an aqueous caustic soda solution to recycle the recovered oxygen gas to the ferment or. 32 x 103 kg hr of caustic soda was required for removing 9 x 03 m3 hr of carbon dioxide formed during the culturing by absorption. In this case, the corresponding amount of water was required for dissolving such a large amount of caustic soda in water. Furthermore, the corresponding amount of the resulting aqueous sodium carbonate solution had to be treated, and when sodium carbonate was recovered as a by product, an additional concentrating unit was required, making operation complicated. In this case, use of carbon dioxide was restricted to sodium carbonate, and if there is no need for sodium carbonate at hand, its disposal is a problem. In the present invention, the necessary oxygen gas for propagation of microorganisms in a ferment or can be supplied from liquid oxygen produced in an oxygen production unit of cryogenic separation type, and at the same time carbon dioxide produced during the culturing can be removed by use of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced in the oxygen production unit of cryogenic separation type. Accordingly, utilization of oxygen to be introduced into the ferment or can be increased, and the adverse effect of accumulated carbon dioxide upon the propagation of microorganisms can be prevented. Furthermore, the coldness of solidified carbon dioxide separated and removed in the carbon dioxideremoving unit can be utilized for removal of the heat generated during the culturing. Still furthermore, carbon dioxide in the effluent gas can be separated as pure dry ice, which can be readily used in a wide field of applications.
