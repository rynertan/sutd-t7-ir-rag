# ROTATING SEAL FOR CONTINUOUS FLOW CENTRIFUGE

## Abstract
A rotating seal assembly for a continuous flow cen trifuge is described. The seal assembly permits both ele ments of the rotating seal, the rotating member as well as a nonrotating member to be resiliently mounted and in such a manner that both may rock as necessary to accommodate the vibrations of the other. Furthermore, the drive for the rotating member is decoupled so that greater freedom of movement for the rotating member is afforded.
