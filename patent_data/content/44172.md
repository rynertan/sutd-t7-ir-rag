## Description
FIBROUS PRODUCT CONTAINING VISCOSE It is common practice to impart easy care properties for instance wet and or dry crease resistance , to fabrics formed of cotton fibres or blends containing cotton fibres with, for instance, polyester fibres.Such methods involve the use of inter alia textile resins or cellulosic cross linking agents. In PCT Patent Specification W080 00463 a process is described for imparting easy care properties to linen products, optionally mixed with voscose. It would be very desirable to be able to make a wide range of easy care products containing viscose but it has not previously been possible to achieve this by any convenient commercial methods. Although viscose has certain inherent advantages as a fabric fibre it also suffers from serious disadvantages. Thus an untreated viscose fabric will not have satisfactory easy care properties, and for instance will readily crease. In an attempt at improving the easy care properties and in order to minimise loss of strength when wet and in order to minimise shrinkage it is common to apply a textile resin. However the amount that is applied has to be such that the resultant fabric loses some of the desirable properties of viscose and instead becomes rather harsh, especially when wet, and the easy care properties are still not entirely satisfactory. Another disadvantage of viscose is that it has very poor dye receptivity, probably because when the viscose fibre is contacted with a dye the fibre swells and so reduces the capillary action that is necessary for reception of dye. Accordingly it is not possible to dye viscose fabrics by conventional continuous dyeing techniques. Viscose is soluble in alkali and since many of the conventional treatments for giving easy care properties require alkali treatment it would be expected that they would result in destruction or damage of the fibres. It has been alleged, in German PatentSpecification 1173428, that good dry and wet resistance and soft hand on fabrics of native or regenerated cellulose can be obtained by treating the fabrics with a compound that evolves formaldehyde when heated followed by treatment with a solution containing 2 to 6 alkali and a glycol softener. In practice however this method does not give very satisfactory results when applied to viscose containing fabrics. In British Patent Specification No. 1034453 a process is described of forming a bulked fabric by cross linking viscose rayon fibre and then using this fibre to form a fabric which is then impregnated with caustic soda and then pulled back to full width. It is also mentioned that the cross linking can be conducted on the fabric itself, but this is not exemplified and in fact it seems probable that the desired bulk effect would not be achieved if the cross linking was conducted on the fabric instead of the free fibre. The process has not been adopted commercially for the treatment of fabric and, prior to the present invention, there has been no known commercial process for making a fabric including substantial amounts of viscose fibres and that has an acceptable combination of dry and wet crease resistance and softness. Although cellulosic fabrics are considered by many users to possess properties that make them preferable to synthetic fabrics for wear in hot humid conditions a disadvantage of many such fabrics is that they become less soft with increasing moisture.Accordingly although they may be very comfortable under moderate conditions of temperature and humidity at high humidity the softness of the fabric has been reduced, thus making the humidity more noticeable to the wearer. It has been our object to devise a method of forming a fabric including viscose fibres and which has a good combination of wet crease resistance and softness and preferably also dry crease resistance. In the invention a fabric that includes viscose fibres, generally in an amount of at least 30 by weight of the fibres in the fabric, is impregnated with an initial cross linking agent and an activator for this, the agent is cured, the fabric is then mercerised while allowing shrinkage of viscose fibres, and the viscose fibres in the fabric are allowed to remain permanently shrunk by at least 5 . The fabric may be formed solely of viscose fibres or it may be formed of viscose fibres together with other fibres, generally in an amount of not more than 50 by weight. These other fibres may be synthetic fibres but preferably are natural fibres, most preferably cotton or linen. Preferred fabrics contain from 50 to 90 viscose and 10 to 40 cotton or linen. When the fabric is formed of a blend of viscose fibres and other fibres the fabric may be formed of yarns consisting of viscose and yarns consisting of the other fibres but more usually is formed of yarns each comprising a blend of viscose and the other fibres.Suitable methods of forming appropriate linen blends are known and reference may be made to, for instance, PCTPublication W080 00463. Any material capable of cross linking the cellulosic molecules of the viscose fibres to the desired extent may be used. Formaldehyde donors may be used but preferably the initial cross linking is achieved by impregnation with a conventional cellulosic cross linking agent and an activator. This cross linking agent is a bi or polyfunctional reagent that will react with, and thus bridge and cross link, hydroxy groups in the cellulose. Typical bi or poly functional compounds that serve as cross linking agents are alcohols, triazones, aldehydes such as glyoxal, and methylol urea derivatives that will react with cellulose in preference to undergoing self polymerisation, such as dimethylol cyclic methylene or ethylene or other alkylene urea. Activators suitable for use with such crosslinking agents are well known and are generally referred to as catalysts or curing agents. They generally are acidic, for instance inorganic or organic acids such as citric or succinic acid or acidic salts such as magnesium chloride. Preferably, instead of using phase separation catalysts such as these, non phase separation curing agents for instance a triethylene glycol citric acid or other citric acid water soluble polyester are used. The cross linking agent and activator are generally applied from an aqueous solution containing, for instance 10 to 30 of the cross linking agent and 0.5 to 5 of the activator. The pick up may be, for example, 50 to 80 by weight of the solution. Curing of the cross linking system may be achieved by, for instance, heating at 120 to 2200C for 0.5 to 5 minutes. Known mercerising reagents and temperatures may be used for the mercerising step in the invention.Suitable reagents are strong ammonia, cuprammonium solutions and other alkaline solutions generally of alkaline earth metal hydroxides, for instance calcium hydroxide or alkali metal hydroxides, generally sodium hydroxide, the latter being preferred. Typical concentrations of caustic soda or other reagent are 10 to 40 , especially 20 to 30 , by weight giving about 6O0Tw. Treatment preferably comprises impregnation e.g. by immersion in a 3 bowl trough mangle at a temperature below 3O0C, preferably 0 to 1ooh. 0Impregnation of caustic soda between 0 10 C is the preferred method. This is obtained by refrigerating the caustic soda and circulating the liquor in the trough for the impregnating mangle. The contact with alkali is generally relatively quick, for. instance f to 30 minutes and usually 1 to 10 minutes,whereupon the fibrous material is washed with water to eliminate the alkali or other mercerising reagent. It seems that the success of the invention resides partly upon the fact that the initial crosslinking provides an appropriate degree of restraint but that the viscose swells and the fibres permanently shrink as a result of the mercerisation. Without the cross linking step, the fibres would dissolve during the mercerisation. It seems that the cross linking provides restraint such that unique changes occur in the structure of the fibres during the mercerisation. It can be considered that the fibres pass through a thermoplastic state. Whatever the precise mechanism, it is a fact that appropriate combination of cross linking followed by mercerisation and permanent shrinkage results in a surprising improvement in the wet crease resistance of the fibres. In order to obtain good results a significant amount of swelling must occur. However if there is insufficient cross linking the degree of swelling will be so much that, after drying the fabric, the fibres will be very brittle and hard. If the degree of crosslinking is too much then the fabric becomes very rigid and inadequate swelling occurs. However higher than normal degrees of cross linking can be tolerated if the cross linking agent is one that is degraded by the mercerising conditions, since the mercerisation will then result initially in reduction of the degree of cross linking and then in the desired swelling and shrinkage. The preferred cross linking agents are cyclic alkylene urea derivatives, for instance dihydroxy dimethylol cyclic methylene or ethylene urea and it is convenient to express the degree of cross linking by reference to the add on of such cross linking agents to the fabric. In general the degree of crosslinking should be bellow 20 add on since satisfactory results are not usually obtainable with higher values, unless the cross linking agent decomposes partially during mercerisation. Generally the cross linking should be above 3 add on, since with lower amounts the degree of restraint is so small that very high shrinkage will occur. Low add ons such as 3 or 4 are particularly desirable when the fabric has a wide warp spacing since it is then possible to make a stretch fabric.For more usual purposes however suitable add ons are from 5 to 20 , especially 5 to 15 . Best results are generally obtained with add ons of from 8 to 13 , most preferably about 10t. When a different type of cross linking agent is used then different, but equivalent, amounts of add on will be required. For instance if the cross linking agent is formaldehyde, either introduced as such or liberated from a formaldehyde donor, then the equivalent amounts of add on will be very much less, due to the lower molecular weight of formaldehyde. For any particular degree of cross linking there will be a potential shrinkage obtainable by the fabric during prolonged mercerisation and preferably the conditions of mercerisation are such that the weft viscose fibres have a final shrinkage of at least 50 and preferably at least 75 of their potential shrinkage and the warp fibres have a shrinkage of at least 25 and preferably at least 33 of their potential shrinkage.For instance the duration of the mercerisation should be selected to be sufficiently long to achieve the desired degree of shrinkage. With the lower degrees of cross linking Cfor instance equivalent to 15 add on or less it is usually sufficient for mercerisation to be conducted for not more than 10 or 15 minutes but with higher degrees of cross linking, for instance 15 to 20 add on, longer periods up to 30 minutes or even more may be required. The mercerisation may be conducted while no tension is applied in the warp or weft, for instance while the fabric is allowed to remain in a relaxed state in a trough, and the fabric may then be pulled lengthwise i.e. in the warp direction to the next processing stage for instance rinsing and drying .This pulling will result in some warp tension and some reduction in the warp shrinkage, which previously will preferably have been the full shrinkage attainable.The weft shrinkage, which also will preferably have been the maximum shrinkage attainable, may be allowed to remain unchanged or may be reduced slightly as a result of stentering the fabric out to a controlled width, which still results in a final shrinkage of at least 5 . Another way of achieving the mercerisation is to conduct the mercerisation while restricting the fabric against some shrinkage in the warp direction and optionally also in the weft direction, for instance by pulling it on a stenter. The tension by which it is held must be such as to permit the desired final shrinkage to occur. Preferably the shrinkage that remains in the weft fibres is at least 10 , generally 10 to 25 and most preferably 15 to 20t. The shrinkage that remains in the warp may be similar but lower shrinkages can be tolerated and may be up to, for instance, 15 , usually 5 to 12 and most preferably 8 to 10 . With most fabric constructions the degree of shrinkage can be observed simply by measuring the reduction in the width and length of the fabric. However with very tight weaves the weave itself may prevent reduction in the width or length of the fabric even though the fibres within the fabric will have shrunk.Accordingly it should be understood that the percentage shrinkage values that are quoted are normally the values obtainable by measuring the width and length of the fabric but that if this is a very tight weave then they are the values that would be obtainable by a more loosely woven fabric treated under the same conditions. A fabric consisting or containing a large proportion of viscose fibres will generally have a wet crease angle of about 900, and this angle is not substantially changed by the cross linking. However the wet crease angle after the mercerisation and permanent shrinkage in the invention can easily be increased to 1200 or more, for instance as much as 1400. Accordingly the mercerised and shrunk products of the invention have good wet crease resistance. The dry crease resistance of the initial fabric is generally around 1000 and this may increase 0 slightly, for instance to 110 , by the cross linking. However the mercerisation will generally result in a reduction of this, for instance back to a value of about 1000. The loss in dry crease angle is generally less with phase separation catalysts than with non phase separation curing agents as discussed above. The wet and dry crease angles mentioned herein are the angles measured by the Shirley Crease Angle test.Higher values indicateWbetter properties. Although fabrics obtainable by cross linking and mercerisation as described above have good handle and wet crease resistance, and are thus suitable for use as, for instance, table cloths or upholstery fabrics, it is desirable to improve their dry crease resistance and it has surprisingly been found that this can be achieved without damaging the other properties of the fabric by applying a textile resin or by further crosslinking the mercerised product. Suitable textile resins are known for the treatment of cotton and may be applied in a similar manner to obtain an add on of 2 to 10 , preferably 3 to 7 and most preferably around 5 . Preferably however the dry crease resistance is improved by subjecting the fabric to a final crosslinking, generally using about half the amount of crosslinking agent used for the initial cross linking, so that the solids add on is preferably about 2 to 10 , e.g 3 to 7 most preferably around 5 . This reduced add on may be achieved using more dilute solutions of the crosslinking agent. The cross linking materials and process may be selected from the process and materials discussed above for use in the initial stage. Typically the 0 final dry crease angle will be 110 to 140 C. Best results are generally obtained using a non phase separation curing agent, for instance a polyester as mentioned above, and this has the particular advantage that it gives a fabric having better abras ion resistance. Fabrics made by the invention have a soft handle and good wet crease resistance, and optionally also good dry crease resistance. A particular advantage of the invention is that the fabrics also can have a unique property in that the fabric becomes softer with increasing humidity. Accordingly a separate aspect of the invention resides in a novel fabric that contains viscose fibres and which is characterised in that the fibres have been cross linked and the fabric becomes softer with increasing humidity. Another advantage of the invention is that it results in the viscose fibres being much more easily dyeable than normal. Thus viscose fabrics processed in accordance with the invention can be subjected to continuous dyung techniques which normally are suitable for use on, for instance , cotton but not viscose. Typically the process of the invention results in it being possible to obtain the same depth of shade but using only half the amount of dyestuff. The following are examples of the invention. Example 1 A fabric may be formed of yarn formed of a blend of viscose and 25 linen or cotton fibres. The fabric may be impregnated while held on a stenter with 20 w v solution of dihydroxy dimethylol cyclic ethylene urea activated with 2 s v triethylene glycol citric acid polyester. The acid value of the polyester may be about 190 and the pH of the impregnating solution should be at least 3.2. The wet pick up of the fabric may be about 70 and the dry add on about 10 by weight.The fabric may then be dried on the stenter, heated to a temperature of about 1700C for 2 minutes, washed and dried. The fabric may then be passed into and pulled out of a bath of caustic soda solution of about 30 and may be drawn out of the bath and partially pulled back to width on a stenter while being rinsed with water.The duration of contact between the caustic soda solution and the viscose fibres may be about 1 to 2 minutes.While the fabric is passing through the bath and before it is rinsed with water thus terminating the mercerisation the tension applied in the length is sufficient to permit the fibres to shrink, and the length of the fabric to reduce, by about 10 . During the passage through the bath no tension is applied in the weft direction, with the result that the weft fibres shrink, and the weft dimensiontreduces, by about 25 . During the rinsing weft tension is applied on the stenter to an amount such that the final shrinkage is about 20 , based on the original width of the fabric. The washed fabric may then be dried. It will have very high wet crease resistance and may be dyed by continuous dyeing techniques and has a soft handle that becomes softer with increasing humidity.Example 2 The process of Example 1 may be repeated using magnesium chloride as the activator instead of the described polyester. The final washed fabric will be found to have wet crease resistance as good as in Example 1 and dry crease resistance rather better than in Example 1.Example 3 The process of Example 1 may be repeated but using higher concentrations of cross linking agent, with the result that the add on is about 15 by weight.The mercerisation may then be conducted by impregnating the fabric, after cross linking, with 30 caustic soda solution at about 50C and then leaving the impregnated fabric in a J box for about 15 minutes before partially pulling it back to width and rinsing and drying it.Example 4 The process of Example 1 or Example 2 may be repeated except that after washing the mercerised fabric the fabric may then be impregnated with a 10 w v solution of dihydroxy dimethyl cyclic ethylene ureaactivated with 1 w v triethylene glycol citric acid polyester. The impregnation may be conducted while the mercerised fabric is held on a stenter and it 0 may be then dried, heated to about 170 C for two minutes washed and dried. The final product will have greatly improved dry crease resistance, while retaining the wet crease resistance of Examples 1 or 2. The add on is 5t. Example 5 The process of Example 1 or Example 2 may be repeated.excpt that after washing the mercerised fabric the fabric may be impregnated with a solution of urea formaldehyde resin, having a molar ratio urea formaldehyde of 1 4 and ammonium dihydrogen phosphate activator at a concentration to give a solids add on of about 5 and an acidity to give a pH on the fabric of about 3.2.The resin may then be cured by heating, followed by washing and drying. Again the product has very good wet crease and dry crease resistance and softness. The fabrics treated and shrunk in the process of the invention may be used to make shaped goods, eg clothes, by conventional methods, while in their permanent shrunk state.
