## Description
SYNTHESIS PROCESS FOR HIGH SILICA ZEOLITES The present invention relates in general to the hydrothermal synthesis of zeolites, and more particularly to the synthesis of high silica alumina silicate zeolites using reaction mixtures which contain organic nitrogenous bases and alkaline earth metal cations, but which are essentially free of alkali metal cations. Zeolites having SiO2 A1203 molar ratios of from 5 to 100 and having X ray diffraction patterns similar to those prepared by the present process are disclosed inU.S.P. 3,702,886 issued November 14, 1972 to R. J. Atgauer et al. In the synthesis process of the aforesaid patent, tetrapropylammonium and sodium cations are both present in the reaction mixture in proportions such that the assynthesized zeolites contain, typically, from 0.83 to 1.3 moles Na20 per mole of A1203. Although the bulk of the zeolitic sodium can, after removal of the organic cation, be replaced with other cations by conventional ion exchange techniques, complete removal of the sodium by this means is a very difficult undertaking, if not a practical impossibility. Since the presence of sodium may be undesirable if the zeolite is to be used in certain catalytic applications, it would be advantageous to be able to synthesize a zeolite of the ZSM 5 or related types which is substantially free of sodium cations. It would also be desirable to use less expensive raw materials than those used in prior art processes. We have now discovered that essentially alkali metal free aluminosilicate zeolites can be synthesized by the process which comprises a providing a substantially alkali metal free reaction mixture having a coposition in terms of the mole ratios of oxides as follows i about 10 to 190 moles of SiO per mole of A1203 ii about 0.04 to 0.5 moles of MO per mole of SiO2 iii about 20 to 600 moles of H20 per mole of MO iv about 1.0 to 10.0 moles of R 0 per mole A1203 wherein M is an alkaline earth metal cation having having an atomic number above 12, and wRZ is an alkylammonium cation and b maintaining said mixture under autogeneous pressure at a temperature of from about 100 to about 2000C until said zeolite is formed, usually for a period of from about 40 to about 200 hours. The reagent sources of the oxides in formulating the aforesaid reaction mixtures are those conventional in zeolite synthesis.Representative alumina sources are activated alumina, gamma alumina and alumina trihydrate.Representative silica sources are silica gels, silicic acid, aqueous colloidal silica sols and solid reactive amorphous silicas. The alkaline earth metal oxides are preferably supplied in the hydroxide form. The alkylammonium cation is preferably supplied in the form of a bromide or hydroxide. The crystalline zeolite product is readily isolated from the unreacted and or water soluble components by filtration and subsequent washing with water. Dehydration to remove the intracrystalline adsorbed water and activate the zeolite is accomplished by calcination in air or in vacuum at temperatures of 2000C or more. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The crystalline zeolites, both naturally occurring and synthetically prepared, are hydrated aluminosilicates whose structures are based on a theoretically limitless 3 dimensional network of AlO and SiO tetrahedra linked by the y sharing of oxygen atoms. Zeolites are commonly represented by the empirical formula M 0 Al 0 aSiO bH 0 2 n 2 3 2 2 wherein n is the valence of the cation M, a is equal to or greater than 2, and b is a value dependant upon the adsorptive capacity of the particular zeolite for water, and the degree of hydration, usually in the range of about 0 to about 40. In the naturally occurring, i.e., mineral, zeolites the cation is usually a metal of the Group I or Group II elements, especially sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and strontium.In synthetic species, the cation in the as synthesized form can be, in addition, ammonium or any of a variety of organic nitrogenous cations such as alkylammonium and aryl ammonium, although the use of some organic nitrogenous compounds involves the disadvantaxe of relatively high reactant costs. In general, the zeolite cations are at least partly exchangeable, although cation size and steric considerations for the crystal lattice sometimes preclude ion exchange with or for certain cations, including the above mentioned organic nitrogenous cations. For reasons not fully understood, the type of zeolite species wnich crystallize from aluminosilicate gels depends strongly upon the cation species present therein. For example, gel compositions which produce zeolite A and zeolite X when sodium is the sole alkali metal present, produce zeolite F and zeolite P respectively when potassium is substituted for the sodium in the gel compositions. In other instances, changing the cation species in the gel compositions will produce a zeolite of the same crystal configuration, but will also create changes in the expected SiO2 A1203 molar ratio of the zeolite product. The crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites prepared in accordance with the practice of the present invention have a chemical composition expressed in terms of moles ratios of oxides as follows wMO A12o3 xSiO2 yH20 zR2O wherein M represents an alkaline earth metal cation having an atomic number above 12, R representa an alkylammonium cation, w is within the range of about 0.1 to 2.0, x is within the range of about 10 to 190, y is within the range of about 0 to 40, and z is within the range of about 0.5 to 5.0. The zeolites may be exchanged with ammonium or other cations, including metal ions, hydrogen ions, rare earth ions and mixtures thereof, by contacting the zeolites with solutions containing the desired cations. In conjunction with the aforesaid chemical composition, the zeolites of this invention possess a distinguishing crystalline structure characterized by an X ray powder diffraction pattern having at least the following interplaner spacings TABLE A Interplanar spacing, d t Relative Intensity 11.1 0.2 Strong 10.0 0.2 Strong 3.85 0.05 Very strong 3.75 0.05 Strong 3.72 0.05 Strong These values are determined by standard techniques. The radiation source was the K doublet of copper, and measuresments were made using a scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip chart pen recorder. The peak intensities, I, and the peak or line positions, which are functions of two times theta 0 , where theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart. From these, the relative intensities and the interplanar spacings, d in Angstroms, for the recorded lines were determined. In Table I the relative intensities are given in terms of numerical values which are equal to 100 times the ratio of the peak intensity, I, to the maximum intensity, Leo ,in the spectrum. Strip chart peaks which appear as shoulders are indicated by the term soh . Ion exchange of the original cation with other cation species does not substantially alter the X ray pattern of the zeolite, but some minor shifts in interplanar spacing can occur. Other minor variations can occur depending on the silicon to aluminum ratio of the particular sample and whether or not the sample has been subjected to elevated temperatures. In any event, the d spacings of the X ray pattern will be within the tolerances indicated in Table A. The zeolite compositions of the present invention are synthesized by preparing a substantially alkali metal free reaction mixture having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, approximately falling within the following ranges TABLE BMole Ratio I II SiO2 A1203 10 190 30 90 MO 5i02 0.04 0.5 0.08 0.25 HZO MO 20 600 80 500R20 A1203 1.0 10.0 1.0 2.0 wherein M represents an alkaline earth metal cation selected from Group IIA of the Periodic System ofElements and having an atomic number above 12. In a preferred embodiment, M is selected from the group consisting of barium, calcium and strontium, R represents an alkylammonium cation, preferably one in which the alkyl grows contain from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, most preferably tetrapropylammonium.Range I above represents the basic range of reactant compositions, whereas Range II is a preferred operating range for reasons of product purity and process economics. The zeolite prepared by the present process has an effective pore diameter of about 6R as determined by adsorption characterization. This pore size permits the separation of mixtures of certain organic compounds, as for example nonquaternary carbon containing paraffins or olefins, from mixtures containing molecules which have quaternary carbon atoms. The zeolite is also useful in the separation of p xylene from mixtures with o xylene, m xylene and ethylbenzene. One separation process contemplated with the present zeolites includes the steps of contacting an aqueous solution or mixture, such as a waste water influent cdntaining an organic compound, with the siliceous zeolitic aluminosilicate, adsorbing at least a portion of tne organic compound on the inner adsorption surfaces of these molecular sieves and thereafter recovering, optionally as an effluent stream, the treated aqueous solution or mixture which exhibits a depleted organic compound content.
