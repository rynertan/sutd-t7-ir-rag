# Fail safe device for electronic control circuitry.

## Abstract
A fail safe device 10 is disclosed for removing power from circuitry 12 to be controlled upon the occurance of an undesired operating condition. The device includes circuitry 16 for generating a fail safe signal that is normally within a predetermined frequency range unless there is an undesired operating condition. It also includes power control circuitry 18 for supplying power to the circuitry 12 to be controlled only when the fail safe signal is within the predetermined fre quency range. In a preferred embodiment, the circuitry for gen erating the fail safe signal includes a programmable computer 14 which regulates the circuitry to be controlled and which, unless there is an undesired operating condition, such as a fai lure of the computer, also generates a sequence of bits in which a predetermined pattern occurs at a known frequency. A comparator circuit 68 compares this sequence of bits with the predetermined pattern and generates a variation in the fail safe signal each time there is a match. In the preferred embodi ment, the power control means includes an electromechanical relay 22 for supplying power to the circuitry 12 to be con trolled when that relay is turned on and relay actuating circuitry 32 for keeping the relay turned on when fail safe signal is within the predetermined frequency range. The power control circuitry 18 may also include latchout circuitry 40, 30 34 for keeping the relay 22 off once it has been turned off and reset circuitry 44 for enabling the relay to be selectively turned on once it has been turned off.
