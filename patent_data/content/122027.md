# Variable length encoding decoding system.

## Abstract
A variable length encoding device includes a shift register 32 for converting a binary data string representing an audio signal into unit words of three 2 bit data e.g., 1,1 , 1,0 , and 0,1 and two 3 bit data e.g., 0,0,0 and 0,0,1 . The 3 bit data words are obtained such that the remaining 2 bit data i.e., 0,0 is used as upper two bits of each of the resultant 3 bit data and is combined with each of the 1 and 0 data of the resultant 3 bit data. The output data words from the shift register 32 are converted by a logic circuit 38 to the corresponding code words in one to one correspondence. Each code word has a bit number twice that of the input data word. If a bit array 1,0,1 is included in the code word bit stream thus obtained, this bit array is further converted to 0,0,1 .
