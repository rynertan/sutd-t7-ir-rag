# Method for preparing low viscosity aromatic polyols.

## Abstract
A method for preparing aromatic polyols useful for the production of polyurethane and polyisocyanurate polymers involves digesting scrap polyalkylene terephthalate polym ers with a digesting agent, typically a low molecular weight polyol. The digestion product is then treated with an alkylene oxide to produce a low viscosity polyol which displays excellent stability over long term storage.
