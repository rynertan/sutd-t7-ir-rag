# Built liquid detergent compositions.

## Abstract
A stable, low viscosity, bleaching, built liquid detergent composition contains 22 to 32 by weight of sodium triphosphate 6 to 15 by weight of an active detergent mixture of anionic sulphonate or sulphate, soap and nonionic detergent in a weight reaatio of 4.5 8.5 0 3 1.5 4 2 10 by weight of an alkali metal sulphite and 0.2 to 2.0 by weight of a non detergent short chain alkyl substituted benzene sulphonate having 1 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Preferred alkali metal sulphite is sodium sulphite and preferred short chain alkyl substituted benzene sulphonate is sodium toluene , xylene or cumene sulphonate. The bleaching liquid detergent composition is a struc tured liquid having a viscosity measured at 20 C and at 21 secondsÂ¹ shear rate of desirably not more than 0.7 Pa s.
