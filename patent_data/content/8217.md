# Non destructive testing method for brazed butt joints in metallic articles and metallic articles tested thereby.

## Abstract
A non destructive method of testing for defects in bra zed joints in metallic articles such as hollow copper electri cal conductors comprising subjecting the joint 2 to a ten sile force which is greater then the yield strenght of the metal of the metallic article 1 across the brazed joint 2 and thereafter passing a X ray beam or an ultrasonic pulse through the brazed joint 2 to detect any gap which has been formed at the brazed joint 2 by the application of the tenside force. X ray and ultrasonic testing of brazed joints does not reliably detect all defects in brazed joints, particularly butt joints, which might later result in failure of the joint under stress. The application of the afore mentioned tensile force exposes such defects by creating a significant gap at the joint which is detectable by X ray or ultrasonic test.
