# Heat treatment of a particulate commodity.

## Abstract
Apparatus for heat treating a particulate commodity comprises an enclosure 10 having a lower wall in the form of a concave, perforate deck 15 , supply means 16, 17 for supplying pressurised fluid at a controlled temperature through the deck to fluidise and heat treat a bed 11 of particles in the enclosure, and transfer means 20 for controlledly moving the particles continuously or stepwise along the deck. A method of heat treating the particulate commodity comprises supporting the commodity in a flui dised bed above a concave, perforate deck, supplying pressurised fluid at a controlled temperature through the deck to fluidise and heat treat the commodity, controlling the residence time of the commodity in the enclosure by controlledly moving the commodity along the deck using transfer means, and enhancing fluidisation of the bed by reducing segregation within the bed using said transfer means. The commodity 11 e.g a food product such as peanuts is heat treated uniformly under precisely controlled conditions.
