# IMPROVED MIXING PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING FILLED RUBBER VULCANIZATES CONTAINING AROMATIC FURAZAN OXIDES

## Abstract
Filled rubber vulcanizates containing aromatic furazan oxides exhibit many improved properties such as increased filler rubber interaction and decreased hysteresis. Useful furazan oxides have both carbons of the furazan ring as part of a fused aromatic ring. Typical examples are ben zofurazan oxide and its methyl and methoxy analogs. Tires made from the inventive vulcanizates show lower running temperatures and improved rolling resistance. The desir able effects of the aromatic furazan oxides may be improved by mixing the rubber, filler and furazan oxide in a conven tional mechanical compounding device at specific tem peratures and time periods such as about 200 400 F for 2 20 minutes.
