# CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION OF XANTHOMONAS BIOPOLYMER

## Abstract
Continuous one and two stage processes for Xanth omonas fermentation are disclosed in which the chemically defined medium supplied to the first stage is growth limiting with respect to nitrogen and metabolically balanced with respect to carbohydrate to ensure substantially complete consumption of both nitrogen and carbohydrate.
