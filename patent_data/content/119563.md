## Description
The present invention relates to a vacuum interrupter comprising a pair of separable contact electrodes, each of which consists of a disc shaped arc diffusing portion and a contact making portion projecting from a central portion of an arcing surface of the arc diffusing portion a vacuum envelope which is electrically insulating and encloses the contact electrodes and means for applying a magnetic field in parallel to an arc established between the contact electrodes when said contact electrodes are separated. The invention has particular reference to a vacuum interrupter for an electric circuit of high power, for example, an alternating current circuit of high power. A vacuum interrupter of the initially named kind is disclosed in Figure 20 of US A 3,946,179, no details are however given concerning the conductivity of the contact making and arc diffusing portions. Recently, it has been required to provide a vacuum interrupter of much enhanced large current interrupting capability and dielectric strength to cope with increasing current and voltage of power lines with an expansion of an electric power supply network. In operation a vacuum interrupter employing an axial magnetic field, which includes a pair of contact electrodes, restricts the electric arc to a space between the contact electrodes with the applied axial magnetic field uniformly diffusing the arc in the space, when the contact electrodes are separated, thus preventing any concentrating arc spot of the contact electrodes from locally overheating and thus enhancing the current interruption capability and dielectric strength of the vacuum interrupter. Generally, the contact electrode itself is required to consistently satisfy the following requirements However, a contact electrode which consistently satisfies all the above requirements has so far not been provided in the present state of the art. For example, a disc shaped contact electrode of copper which includes a plurality of radial slits has been proposed as a contact electrode of a well known vacuum interrupter of the axial magnetic field type. The disc shaped and slitted contact electrode has certain advantages in that it reduces eddy currents so as not to weaken the axial magnetic field. However, the small tensile strength of copper, which amounts to 20 kgf mm In addition, electric fields and multiple arcs are concentrated at edge portions of the slits which reduces the dielectric strength between the contact electrodes, particularly the dielectric strength after an interruption of a large current hereinafter, referred to as dynamic dielectric strength and erodes the contact electrode see e.g. US A 3,946,179 . Furthermore, various contact electrodes are known which are adapted for large currents of low voltage. These contact electrodes are made of copper alloyed with a minor constituent of a low melting point and a high vapor pressure, such as a contact electrode of copper alloyed with 0.5 bismuth by weight hereinafter, referred to as a Cu 0.5Bi alloy which is disclosed in the US A 3,246,979, or a contact electrode which is disclosed in the US A 3,596,027. These pairs of contact electrodes are however designed for use in a vacuum interrupter of an arc driving type but not for use in a vacuum interrupter of the axial magnetic field type. Such contact electrodes of copper alloyed with a minor constituent of a low melting point and high vapor pressure as a contact electrode of Cu 0.5Bi alloy are excellent in large current interrupting capability, electrical conductivity and anti welding capability, but are significantly low in dielectric strength, particularly in dynamic dielectric strength. In particular, the current chopping value of a pair of contact electrodes of Cu 0.5Bi alloy amounts to 10A, which is relatively high, so that harmful chopping surges can be caused during current interruption. Thus, a pair of contact electrodes of Cu 0.5Bi alloy do not have good lagging small current interrupting capability, which can lead to dielectric breakdown of electrical devices of inductive load circuits. For overcoming the drawbacks of the contact electrode of copper alloyed with a minor constituent of a low melting point and a high vapor pressure, various contact electrodes are known of an alloy consisting of copper and a material of a high melting point and a low vapor pressure, such as contact electrodes of an alloy consisting of 20 copper by weight and 80 tungsten by weight hereinafter referred to as a 20Cu 80W alloy which is disclosed in the US A 3,811,939, or a contact electrode which is disclosed in the GB A 2,024,257A. Such contact electrodes of alloys consisting of copper and a material of a high melting point and a low vapor pressure, e.g. the above described contact electrode of 20Cu 80W alloy, have a relatively high static dielectric strength, but a relatively low large current interrupting capability. Attention should also be drawn to DE A 29 47 090 and to EP A 113 962 both of which disclose vacuum interrupters of the axial magnetic feld type. In DE A 29 47 090 the arc contacts have a depressed circular center and the contact making portion and the arc diffusing portion are formed by one and the same piece of material which is of high conductivity, e.g. a copper chromium contact. In addition the reference describes a low conductivity backing disc butted onto the back surface of the contact. The backing disc has a smaller diameter than the arc contact itself and cannot be considered part of the arc contact because it has no arcing surface. EP A 113 962, which is regarded as prior art only under the aspect of novelty, also describes an arc contact in which the contact making portion and the arc diffusing portion are formed by one and the same piece of material and therefore have the same conductivities. An object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum interrupter of the axial magnetic field type which has excellent large current interrupting capability and dielectric strength. Another object of the present invention is to provide a vacuum interrupter of the axial magnetic field type which possesses high resistance against mechanical impact and electromagnetic forces based on large currents, and therefore long period durability. In order to satisfy these objects the present invention is given in the characterizing part of claim 1. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are set forth in the appended subordinate claims.

As shown in Figure 1, a vacuum interrupter of a first embodiment of the present invention includes a vacuum envelope 4 which is evacuated to less than 10 ⁴ Torr 13.4 mPa and a pair of stationary and movable electrode assemblies 5 and 6 located within the vacuum envelope 4. The vacuum envelope 4 comprises, in the main, two insulating cylinders 2 of the same shape of glass or alumina ceramics which are serially and hermetically associated by welding or brazing to each other by means of sealing metallic rings 1 of Fe Ni Co alloy or Fe Ni alloy at the adjacent ends of the insulating cylinders 2, and a pair of metallic end plates 3 of austinitic stainless steel hermetically associated by welding or brazing to both the remote ends of the insulating cylinders 2 by means of sealing metallic rings 1. A metallic arc shield 7 of a cylindrical form which surrounds the electrode assemblies 5 and 6 is supported on and hermetically joined by welding or brazing to the sealing metallic rings at the adjacent ends of the insulating cylinders 2. Further, metallic edge shields 8 which moderate electric field concentration at edges of the sealing metallic rings 1 at the remote ends of the insulating cylinders 2 are joined by welding or brazing to the pair of metallic end plates 3. An axial shield 11 and a bellows shield 12 are provided on respective stationary and movable lead rods 9 and 10 which are electrically and mechanically joined to the respective stationary and movable electrode assemblies 5 and 6. The arc shield 7, the edge shield 8, the axial shield 11 and the bellows shield 12 all are made of austinitic stainless steel. The electrode assemblies 5 and 6 have the same construction and the movable electrode assembly 6 will be described hereinafter. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the movable electrode assembly 6 comprises a movable contact electrode 13, an electrical lead member 14 for a coil electrode of which all portions are electrically and mechanically joined by brazing to the backsurface of the movable contact electrode 13, a coil electrode 15 which is mechanically and electrically joined by brazing to the inner end of the movable lead rod 10, spaced from the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode, a spacer 16 positioned between the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode and the coil electrode 15, with the two ends of the spacer rigidly connecting together the central portions of the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode and the coil electrode 15, but with the lead member 14 and the coil electrode being substantially electrically insulated from each other, electrical connectors 17 of columnar form which electrically connect the outer peripheries of the lead member 14 and the coil electrode 15, and a reinforcement member 18 for the coil electrode 15. The elements listed above will be successively described in particular. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the movable contact electrode 13 which generally takes the form of a thinned frustrum of a cone consists of a contact making portion 19 and an arc diffusing portion 20 electrically and mechanically joined by brazing to the contact making portion 19. The contact making portion 19 is made of material of 20 to 60 IACS electrical conductivity, for example, complex metal consisting of 20 to 70 copper by weight, 5 to 70 chromium by weight and 5 to 70 molybdenum by weight. In this case, the contact making portion 19 can exhibit equivalently the same electrical contact resistance due to its thin disc shape as a contact making member of Cu 0.5Bi alloy. The contact making portion 19 which is shaped as a frustrum of a circular cone is also fitted into a circular recess 21 which is formed in the central portion of the surface of an arc diffusing portion 20, and projects from the surface of the arc diffusing portion 20. For reducing the amount of eddy current created in the movable contact electrode 13 as much as possible, the contact making portion 19 has a diameter in the range from 20 to 60 of the diameter of the arc diffusing portion 20. The arc diffusing portion 20 is made of material of 2 to 30 , preferably, 10 to 15 IACS electrical conductivity, for example, material containing copper, iron and chromium. As examples of the latter material one can quote a complex metal of about 30 kgf mm The thickness t of the central portion of the movable contact electrode 13 is made at most 10 mm in view of the generation of Joule heat produced when the stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13 are in contact. The electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode, an outer diameter of which is normally no more than the diameter of the movable contact electrode 13, is made of material of high electrical conductivity such as Cu, Ag, Cu alloy or Ag alloy. The electrical conductivity of that material is much larger than that of a material of the arc distributing portion 20. As shown in Figure 3, the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode includes the hub 22, two radial webs 25 oppositely extending from the hub 22 and two arcuate bridges 26 extending in a common circumferential direction from the outer ends of the respective radial webs 25. The hub 22, radial webs 25 and angular bridges 26, as described above, all are electrically and mechanically joined by brazing to the backsurface of the movable contact electrode 13. A circular recess 27 to which one end of the electrical connector 17 is brazed is provided in the backsurface of the distal end of each arcuate bridge 26. The electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode serves to carry most of the current which, in the absence of the electrical lead member 14 would flow through the movable contact electrode 13 alone in a radial direction thereof thereby raising the temperature of the movable contact electrode 13 due to Joule heating. Electrical lead member 14 thus suppresses such a rise in temperature. The coil electrode 15 which serves to establish the major part of axial magnetic field is made of material of high electrical conductivity, e.g., Cu, Ag, Cu alloy or Ag alloy, as is the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode. As shown in Figure 3, the coil electrode 15 includes a circular hub 28, two radial webs 29 oppositely extending from the circular hub 28, and two partially turning segments 30 extending in a common circumferential direction from outer ends of the respective radial webs 29. The direction of an extension of the partially turning segments 30 is opposite to the direction of an extension of the bridges 26. An angular gap 31 is provided between the adjacent distal end of each partially turning segment 30 and each radial web 29. A circular hole 32 into which a part of the electrical connector 17 is secured by means of brazing is provided at the distal end of each partially turning segment 30. A circular recess 33 into which an outwardly extending flange 16a at one end of the spacer 16 is secured by means of brazing is provided in the surface of the hub 28. Moreover, a circular recess 34 into which the inner end of the movable lead rod 10 is secured by means of brazing is provided in the backsurface of the hub 28. The coil electrode 15 of Figure 3 is a 1 2 turn type, however, may be of a 1 3, 1 4 or one turn type. The spacer 16 rigidly connects the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode and the coil electrode 15 to each other in a manner to space them apart. The spacer 16 is also made of material of high mechanical strength, good brazability, and of such low electrical conductivity that the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode and the coil electrode 15 are effectively insulated from one another. Thus, for example, stainless steel or Inconnel may be used. Further, the spacer 16, which is shaped as a short cylinder having a pair of outwardly extending flanges 16a at the opposite ends thereof, is brazed at both the outwardly extending flanges 16a to the hubs 22 and 28 of the electrical lead member 14 for the coil electrode and the coil electrode 15. The reinforcement member 18 is made of material of high mechanical strength and low electrical conductivity, e.g., stainless steel, as well as the spacer 16. The reinforcement member 18 includes a hub 35 brazed to a periphery of the movable lead rod 10, a plurality of supporting arms 36 radially extending from the hub 35, and two limbs 37 which are integrated on to the outer ends of the supporting arms 36 and includes upward flanges. The limbs 37 are brazed to the partially turning segments 30 of the coil electrode 15. A comparative performance test was carried out between a vacuum interrupter of the axial magnetic field applying type according to the first embodiment of the present invention, and a conventional vacuum interrupter of the axial magnetic field applying type refer to US A 3,946,179 . The former interrupter includes a pair of contact electrodes each of which consists of a contact making portion of complex metal consisting of 50 copper by weight, 10 chromium by weight and 40 molybdenum by weight, and an arc diffusing portion of complex metal consisting of 50 copper by weight and 50 SUS 304 by weight. The diameter of the contact making portion is 20 of the diameter of the arc diffusing portion. The latter interrupter includes a pair of disc shaped contact electrodes of Cu 0.5Bi alloy, each of the pair has six linear slits extending radially from an outer periphery and a 1 4 turn typed coil. Results of the performance comparison test will be described as follows In the specification, amounts of voltage and current are represented as a rms value if not specified. Maximum interruption current I kA was measured at rated 84 kV when the diameter D mm of each contact electrode was varied. Figure 4 shows results of the measurement. In Figure 4, the ordinate represents maximum interruption current I and the abscissa represents the diameter D of each contact electrode. Line A represents a relationship between the maximum interruption current I and the diameter D of each contact electrode relative to a vacuum interrupter of the present invention. Line B indicates the relationship between the maximum interruption current I and the diameter D of each contact electrode relative to a conventional vacuum interrupter. As apparent from Figure 4, the vacuum interrupter according to the first embodiment of the present invention exhibits 2 to 2.5 times large current interrupting capability than that of the conventional vacuum interrupter. In accordance with JEC 181 test method, withstand voltages were measured for the vacuum interrupter of the first embodiment of the present invention and for the conventional vacuum interrupter, with a 3.0 mm gap between contact making portions relative to the present invention but with a 10 mm gap between contact making portions relative to the conventional vacuum interrupter. In this case, both the vacuum interrupters exhibited the same withstand voltage. Thus, the vacuum interrupter of the present invention possesses over 3 times the dielectric strength of the conventional vacuum interrupter. Withstand voltages for the first embodiment of the present teaching and for the conventional vacuum interrupter were also measured before and after large current interruption. The withstand voltage after large current interruption of the former interrupter decreased to about 80 of the withstand voltage before large current interruption thereof. On the other hand, the withstand voltage after large current interruption of the latter interrupter decreased to about 30 of the withstand voltage before large current interruption thereof. The anti welding capability of the contact electrodes of the first embodiment of the present invention amounted to 80 of the anti welding capability of those of the conventional vacuum interrupter. However, such decrease is not actually significant. If necessary, the disengaging force applied to the contact electrodes may be slightly enhanced. The current chopping value of the vacuum interrupter of the first embodiment of the present invention amounted to 40 of that of the conventional vacuum interrupter, so that chopping surge was almost insignificant. This value was maintained even after the contact electrodes had engaged and disengaged more than 100 times for interrupting lagging small current. The vacuum interrupter of the first embodiment of the present invention interrupted twice the charging current of the conventional vacuum interrupter connected to condenser or unload line of condenser. Figure 5 shows an electrode assembly 40 of a modification to the first embodiment of the present invention. The electrode assembly 40 structurally differs from the movable electrode assembly 6 of Figure 2 in the aspect that it includes a contact electrode 43 consisting of an arc diffusing portion 41 including a centrally located circular hole 42 and a contact making portion 19 of Figure 4 fitted into the hole 42, and an electrical lead member 45 for a coil electrode including an annular hub 44. In this case, the axial length of the spacer 16 may be increased. A surface of the hub 44 is electrically and mechanically joined by brazing to the backsurface of the contact making portion 19. On the other hand, the periphery of the hub 44 is electrically and mechanically joined by brazing to the wall defining the hole 42. The electrode assembly 40 advantageously makes, the electrical resistance between the contact making portion 19 and the electrical lead member 45 for the coil electrode, smaller than that of the same current path of the electrode assembly 6 of Figure 2. Figure 6 shows an electrode assembly 50 of another modification to the first embodiment of the present invention. The electrode assembly 50 structurally differs from the movable electrode assembly 6 of Figure 2 in that it includes a contact electrode 52 consisting of an arc diffusing portion 41 of Figure 5 and a contact making portion 51 thickened and fitted into the hole 42 of the arc diffusing portion 41. A backsurface of the contact making portion 51 is electrically and mechanically joined by brazing to the hub 22 of an electrical lead member 14 for a coil electrode of Figure 2. On the other hand, a periphery of the contact making portion 51 is electrically and mechanically joined by brazing to a wall defining the hole 42. The electrode assembly 50 has the same advantages as that of the electrode assembly 40 of Figure 5. According to the first embodiment and the modifications thereto, the coil electrodes for applying an axial magnetic field are each provided behind each coil electrode. The present invention is also applicable to vacuum interrupters that include means for applying an axial magnetic field outside its vacuum envelope refer to US A 3,283,103 , to vacuum interrupters that include a coil for applying an axial magnetic field one end of which is directly connected to the backsurface of a contact electrode refer to US A 3,935,406 , and to vacuum interrupters that include a coil for applying an axial magnetic field located surrounding a pair of contact electrodes refer to GB A 1,264,490 . The present invention is further applicable to such vacuum interrupters as include a contact electrode consisting of a flat arc diffusing portion and a contact making portion projecting from a surface of the arc diffusing portion at the central portion of the surface thereof. Other embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter in which changes were made to materials of the contact making portion 19 and the arc diffusing portion 20 of the pair of stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13. Figures 7A to 7D, Figures 8A to 8D and Figures 9A to 9D show structures of complex metals constituting arc diffusing portions according to the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present teaching. According to the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present teaching, arc diffusing portion 20 is made of material of 5 to 30 IACS electrical conductivity, at least 30 kgf mm Firstly, a predetermined amount e.g., an amount of one final contact electrode plus a machining margin of chromium powder and iron powder which are respectively prepared 5 to 40 by weight and 5 to 40 by weight but in total 30 to 80 by weight at a final ratio, are mechanically and uniformly mixed. Secondly, the resultant powder mixture is placed in a vessel of a circular section made of material, e.g., alumina ceramics, which interacts with none of chromium, iron and copper. A solid copper is placed on the powder mixture. Thirdly, the powder mixture and the solid copper are heat held under a nonoxidizing atmosphere, e.g., a vacuum pressure of at highest 5x10 ⁵ Torr 6.67 mPa at 1000 C for 10 min hereinafter, referred to as a chromium iron diffusion step , thus resulting in a porous matrix of chromium and iron. Then, the resultant porous matrix and the solid copper are heat held under the same vacuum at 1100 C for 10 min, which leads to infiltrating the porous matrix with molten copper hereinafter, referred to as a copper infiltrating step . After cooling, a desired complex metal for the arc diffusing portion is produced. At first, chromium powder and iron powder are mechanically and uniformly mixed in the same manner as in the first infiltration process. Secondly, the resultant powder mixture is placed in the same vessel as that in the first infiltration process. The powder mixture is heat held in a nonoxidizing atmosphere, e.g. a vacuum pressure of at highest 5x 10 ⁵ Torr 6.67 mPa , or hydrogen, nitrogen or argon gas at a temperature below the melting point of iron, e.g., within 600 to 1000 C for a fixed period of time, e.g., within 5 to 60 min., thus resulting in a porous matrix consisting of chromium and iron. Thirdly, in the same nonoxidizing atmosphere, e.g., a vacuum pressure of at highest 5x 10 ⁵ Torr 6.67 mPa , as that of the chromium iron diffusion step, or other nonoxidizing atmosphere, a solid copper is placed on the porous matrix, then the porous matrix and the solid copper are heat held at a temperature of at least the melting point of copper but below a melting point of the porous matrix, e.g., 1100 C for about a period of time of 5 to 20 min., which leads to infiltrating the porous matrix with molten copper. After cooling, a desired complex metal for the arc diffusing portion is produced. In the second infiltration process, a solid copper is not placed in the vessel in the chromium iron diffusion step, so that a powder mixture of chromium powder and iron powder can be heat held to a porous matrix at a temperature of at least the melting point 1083 C of copper but below the melting point 1537 C of iron. As an alternative in the second infiltration process the chromium iron diffusion step may be performed in various nonoxidizing atmospheres, e.g., hydrogen, nitrogen or argon gas, and the copper infiltration step may be performed under an evacuation to vacuum degassing the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion. In both the infiltration processes, vacuum is preferably selected as a nonoxidizing atmosphere, but not other nonoxidizing atmosphere, because degassing of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion can be concurrently performed during heat holding. However, even if a deoxidizing gas or an inert gas is used as a nonoxidizing atmosphere, the resultant process is satisfactory for producing the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion. . In addition, a heat holding temperature and period of time for the chromium iron diffusion step is determined on a basis of taking into account conditions of the vacuum furnace or other gas furnace, the shape and size of a porous matrix and workability so that desired properties as those of a complex metal for the arc diffusing portion will be produced. For example, a heating temperature of 600 C determines a heat holding period of 60 min. or a heating temperature of 1000 C determines a heat holding period of 5 min. The particle size of a chromium particle and an iron particle may be less than 60 meshes, i.e., no more than 250 µm. However, the lower an upper limit of the particle size, generally the more difficult to uniformly distribute each metal particle. Further, it is more complicated to handle the metal particles and, when used, they necessitate a pretreatment because they are more liable to be oxidized. On the other hand, if the particle size of each metal particle exceeds 60 meshes, it is necessary to make the heat holding temperature higher or to make the heat holding period longer with a diffusion distance of each metal particle increasing, which leads to lower productivity of the chromium iron diffusion step. Consequently, the upper limit of the particle size of each metal particle is determined in view of various conditions. Thus, in both infiltration processes, it is because the particles of chromium and iron can be more uniformly distributed to cause better diffusion bonding thereof, thus resulting in a complex metal for the arc diffusing portion possessing better properties that the particle size of each metal particle is determined to be less than 100 meshes. If chromium particles and iron particles are badly distributed, then drawbacks of both metals will not be offset by each other and advantages thereof will not be developed. In particular, the more the particle size of each metal particle exceeds 60 meshes, the larger is the proportion of copper in the surface region of an arc diffusing portion, which contributes to lowering the dielectric strength of the contact electrode. Similarly, particles, iron particles and chromium iron alloy particles which have large granulations are more likely to appear in the surface region of the arc diffusing portion, so that the respective drawbacks of chromium, iron and copper are more apparent. Firstly, chromium powder, iron powder and copper powder which are prepared in the same manner as in the first infiltration process are mechanically and uniformly mixed. Secondly, the resultant powder mixture is placed in a preset vessel and press shaped into a green compact under a preset pressure, e.g., of 2,000 to 5,000 kgf cm Thirdly, the resultant green compact which is taken out of the vessel is heat held in a nonoxidizing atmosphere, e.g., a vacuum pressure of at highest 5x 10 ⁵ Torr 6.67 mPa , or hydrogen, nitrogen or argon gas at a temperature below the melting point of copper, e.g., at 1000 C, or at a temperature of at least the melting point of copper but below the melting point of iron, e.g., at 1100 C for a preset period of time, e.g., within 5 to 60 min., thus being sintered into the complex metal of the arc diffusing portion. In the sintering process, conditions of the nonoxidizing atmosphere and the particle size of each metal particle are the same as those in both the infiltration processes, and conditions of the heat holding temperature and the heat holding period of time required for sintering the green compact are the same as those for producing the porous matrix from the powder mixture of metal powders in the infiltration processes. Referred to Figures 7A to 7D, Figures 8A to 8D and Figures 9A to 9D which are photographs by the X ray microanalyzer, structures of the complex metals for the arc diffusing portion 20 which are produced according to the first infiltration process above, will be described hereinafter. Example A Figure 7A shows a secondary electron image of a metal structure of Example A Figure 7B shows a characteristic X ray image of distributed and diffused iron, in which distributed white or gray insular agglomerates indicate iron. Figure 7C shows a characteristic X ray image of distributed and diffused chromium, in which distributed gray insular agglomerates indicate chromium. Figure 7D shows a characteristic X ray image of infiltrant copper, in which white parts indicate copper. Example A Figures 8A, 8B, 8C and 8D show similar images to those of Figures 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D, respectively. Example A Figures 9A, 9B, 9C and 9D show similar images to those of Figures 7A, 7B, 7C and 7D, respectively. As apparent from Figures 7A to 7D, Figures 8A to 8D and Figures 9A to 9D, the chromium and the iron are uniformly distributed and diffused into each other in the metal structure, thus forming many insular agglomerates. The agglomerates are uniformly bonded to each other throughout the metal structure, resulting in the porous matrix consisting of chromium and iron. Interstices of the porous matrix are infiltrated with copper, which results in a stout structure of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion. Figures 10A to 10D, Figures 11A to 11D and Figures 12A to 12D show structures of complex metals for the contact making portions 19 according to the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present invention. According to the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present invention, the contact making portion 19 is made of material of 20 to 60 IACS electrical conductivity and 120 to 180 Hv hardness, e.g., complex metal consisting of 20 to 70 copper by weight, 5 to 70 chromium by weight and 5 to 70 molybdenum by weight. The complex metals for the contact making portion are produced substantially by the same processes as those for producing the arc diffusing portion. Referred to Figures 10A to 10D, Figures 11A to 11D and Figures 12A to 12D which are photographs by the X ray microanalyzer as well as Figures 7A to 7D, structures of the complex metals for the contact making portion which are produced according to substantially the same process as the first infiltration process above, will be described hereinafter. Example C Figure 10A shows a secondary electron image of a metal structure of Example C Figure 10B shows a characteristic X ray image of distributed and diffused molybdenum, in which distributed gray insular agglomerates indicate molybdenum. Figure 10C shows a characteristic X ray image of distributed and diffused chromium, in which distributed gray or white insular agglomerates indicate chromium. Figure 10D shows a characteristic X ray image of infiltrant copper, in which white parts indicate copper. Example C Figures 11A, 11B, 11C and 11D show similar images to those of Figures 10A, 10B, 10C and 10D, respectively. Example C Figures 12A, 12B, 12C and 12D show similar images to those of Figures 10A, 10B, 10C and 10D, respectively. As apparent from Figures 10A to 10D, Figures 11A to 11D and Figures 12A to 12D, the chromium and molybdenum are uniformly distributed and diffused into each other in the metal structure, thus forming many insular agglomerates. The agglomerates are uniformly bonded to each other throughout the metal structure, thus resulting in the porous matrix consisting of chromium and molybdenum. Interstices of the porous matrix are infiltrated with copper, which results in a stout structure of the complex metal for the contact making portion. Measurements of IACS electrical conductivity which were carried out on Examples A1, A2 and A3 of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion established that they possessed 8 to 10 IACS electrical conductivity, at least 30 kgf mm On the other hand, tests established that Examples C1, C2 and C3 possessed 40 to 50 IACS electrical conductivity and 120 to 180 Hv hardness. The contact making portion of a 1st comparative is made of 20Cu 80W alloy. The contact making portion of a 2nd comparative is made of Cu 0.5Bi alloy. Examples A When performances of the vacuum interrupters of the 2nd to 4th and 6th to 10th embodiments of the present invention differ from those of the 5th embodiment of the present invention, then different points shall be specified. Interruption tests which were carried out at an opening speed within 1.2 to 1.5 m s under a rated voltage of 12 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 21 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted 60 kA current. Moreover, interruption tests at an opening speed of 3.0 m s under a rated voltage of 84 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 143 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted 49 kA current. Table 1 below shows the results of the large current interrupting capability tests. Table 1 also shows those of vacuum interrupters of 1st to 8th comparatives which include a pair of contact electrodes each consisting of an arc diffusing portion and a contact making portion. The portions have the same sizes as those of the respective arc diffusing portion and contact making portion of the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present invention. An arc diffusing portion and a contact making portion of a contact electrode of the 1st comparative are made of Example A Vacuum interrupters of the axial magnetic field applying type of the 3rd to 8th comparatives each are of a type in which an outer periphery of a backsurface of an arc diffusing portion and a distal end of a partial turning segment of a coil electrode are connected to each other by means of an electrical connector refer to US A 3,946,179 . In accordance with JEC 181 test method, impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out with a 3.0 mm inter contact gap. The vacuum interrupters showed 120 kV withstand voltage against both positive and negative impulses with a 10 kV deviation. After 10 times interrupting 60 kA current of rated 12 kV, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing the same results. After continuously 100 times opening and closing a circuit through which 80 A leading small current of rated 12 kV flowed, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing substantially the same results. Table 2 below shows the results of the tests of the impulse withstand voltage at rated 84 kV which were carried out on the vacuum interrupters of the 5th embodiment. Table 2 also shows those of the vacuum interrupters of the 1st to 8th comparatives. In accordance with the IEC rated short time current, current of 25 kA was flowed through the stationary and movable contact electrode 24 and 13 which were forced to contact each other under 130 kgf 1275N force, for 3 s. The stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13 were then separated without any failures with a 200 kgf 1961 N static separating force. An increase of electrical contact resistance was then limited to within 2 to 8 In accordance with the IEC rated short time current, current of 50 kA was flowed through the stationary and movable contact electrodes 5 and 6 which were forced to contact each other under 1,000 kgf 9807N force, for 3 s. The stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13 were then separated without any failures with a 200 kgf 1961N static separating force. An increase of electrical contact resistance was limited to no more than 5 . Thus, the stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13 actually possess good anti welding capability. In accordance with a lagging small current interrupting test of JEC 181, a 30A test current of was flowed through the stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13. Current chopping values had a 3.9A average however, a standard deviation σ In particular, current chopping values of the vacuum interrupters of the 6th and 7th embodiments of the present invention were respectively 3.7A however, σ In accordance with a leading small current interrupting test standard of JEC 181, a test leading small current of 80 A at was flowed through the stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13. Under that condition a continuously 10,000 times opening and closing test was carried out. No reignition was established. The following limits were apparent on a composition ratio of each metal in the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion. Copper below 20 by weight significantly lowered current interrupting capability. On the other hand, copper above 70 by weight significantly lowered the mechanical and dielectric strengths of the arc diffusing portion but increased the electrical conductivity thereof, thus significantly lowering the current interrupting capability. Chromium below 5 by weight increased the electrical conductivity of the arc diffusing portion, thus significantly lowering the current interrupting capability and dielectric strength. On the other hand, chromium above 40 by weight significantly lowered the mechanical strength of the arc diffusing portion. Iron below 5 by weight significantly lowered the mechanical strength of the arc diffusing portion. On the other hand, iron above 40 by weight significantly lowered the current interrupting capability. The following limits were apparent on a composition ratio of each metal in the complex metal for the contact making portion. Copper below 20 by weight significantly lowered the electrical conductivity of the contact making portion but significantly increased the electrical contact resistance thereof. On the other hand, copper above 70 by weight significantly increased the current chopping value but significantly lowered the anti welding capability and dielectric strength. Chromium below 5 by weight significantly lowered the dielectric strength. On the other hand, chromium above 70 by weight significantly decreased the electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of the contact making portion. Molybdenum below 5 by weight significantly lowered the dielectric strength. On the other hand, molybdenum above 70 by weight significantly lowered the mechanical strength of the contact making portion but significantly increased the current chopping value. According to the second to 10th embodiments of the present invention, the increased tensile strength of the arc diffusing portion significantly decreases a thickness and weight of the contact making portion and considerably improves the durability of the contact making portion. According to them, decreased the electrical conductivity of the arc diffusing portion significantly decreases amount of eddy current, thus obviating the need for any slit to considerably increase the mechanical strength of the contact electrode. Accordingly the arc diffusing portion and the contact making portion are prevented from excessively melting, thus resulting in a significantly decreased erosion of both the portions, because the arc diffusing portion is made of complex metal of high hardness and including uniformly distributed constituents, and because the arc diffusing portion includes no slit. Thus, the recovery voltage characteristic is improved and there is little lowering of dielectric strength even after many interruptions. For example, lowering of dielectric strength after 10,000 interruptions amounts to 10 to 20 of dielectric strength before interruption, thus decreasing current chopping value too. Figures 13A to 13D and Figures 14A to 14D show structures of complex metals for the arc diffusing portion. According to 11th and 28th embodiments of the present invention, arc diffusing portions 20 are made of complex metal consisting of 30 to 70 magnetic stainless steel by weight and 30 to 70 copper by weight.

Example A Figure 13A shows a secondary electron image of a metal structure of Example A As apparent from Figures 13A to 13D, the particles of ferritic stainless steel SUS434 are bonded to each other, resulting in a porous matrix. Interstices of the porous matrix are infiltrated with copper, which results in a stout structure of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion. Example A Figures 14A, 14B, 14C and 14D show similar images to those of Figures 13A, 13B, 13C and 13D, respectively.

Interruption tests which were carried out at an opening speed within 1.2 to 1.5 m s under a rated voltage of 12 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 21 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted, 63 kA current. Moreover, interruption tests at an opening speed of 3.0 m s under a rated voltage of 84 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 143 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted 52 kA current. Table 3 below shows the results of the large current interrupting capability tests. In accordance with JEC 181 test method, impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out with a 30 mm inter contact gap. The results showed 400 kV withstand voltage against both positive and negative impulses with a 10 kV deviation. After 10 times interrupting 63 kA current of rated 12 kV, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing the same results. After continuously 100 times opening and closing a circuit through which 80A leading small current of rated 12 kV flowed, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing substantially the same results. Table 4 below shows the results of the tests of the impulse withstand voltage at rated 84 kV which were carried out on the vacuum interrupters of the 11th embodiment of the present invention, and the 9th to 12th comparatives. The same as in item 8 . In accordance with a lagging small current interrupting test of JEC 181, a 30A test current of was flowed through the stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13. Current chopping values had a 3.9A average however, a standard deviation σ In particular, current chopping values of the vacuum interrupters of the 12th, 15th, 18th, 21st, 24th and 27th embodiments of the present invention had a 3.7A however, σ The same as in item 10 . The following limits were apparent on a composition ratio of magnetic stainless steel in the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion of the 11th to 28th embodiments of the present invention. Magnetic stainless steel below 30 by weight significantly increased the electrical conductivity to generate large eddy current but lowered the mechanical strength and durability of the arc diffusing portion 20, so that the arc diffusing portion 20 had to be thickened. On the other hand, magnetic stainless steel above 70 by weight significantly lowered interruption performances. The 11th and 28th embodiments of the present invention effect the same advantages as the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present invention do. Figures 15A to 15E show structures of the complex metals for the arc diffusing portion 20 of the 29th to 37th embodiments of the present invention. Arc diffusing portions 20 of the 29th to 37th embodiments of the present invention are made of complex metal consisting of 30 to 70 austinitic stainless steel by weight and 30 to 70 copper by weight.

Contact making portions 19 of the 29th to 37th embodiments of the present invention are made of complex metal of the same composition as that of the complex metal of the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present invention. Referred to Figures 15A to 15E which are photographs by the X ray microanalyzer, structures of the complex metals for the arc diffusing portion which were produced by substantially the same process as the first infiltration process, will be described hereinafter. Example A₁₀ of a complex metal for the arc diffusing portion possesses a composition consisting of 50 austinitic stainless steel SUS304 by weight and 50 copper by weight.

Example A₁₂ of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion possesses a composition consisting of 30 austinitic stainless steel SUS304 by weight and 70 copper by weight. Measurements of IACS electrical conductivity which were carried out on Examples A₁₀ to A₁₂ of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion and Examples C Examples A₁₀ to A₁₂ of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion 20 and Examples C Interruption tests which were carried out at an opening speed within 1.2 to 1.5 m s under a rated voltage of 12 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 21 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted, 60 kA current. Moreover, interruption tests at an opening speed of 3.0 m s under a rated voltage of 84 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 143 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted 50 kA current. Table 5 below shows the results of the large current interrupting capability tests which were carried out on the vacuum interrupters of the 29th to 37th embodiments. Table 5 also shows those of vacuum interrupters of the 13th and 14th comparatives which include a pair of contact electrodes each consisting of an arc diffusing portion and a contact making portion each having the same sizes as those of the arc portions of the contact electrodes of the 29th and 37th embodiments of the present invention. The arc diffusing portion and the contact making portion of the 13th comparative are respectively made of Example A₁₀ and 20Cu 80W alloy. Those of the 14th comparative, of Example A₁₀ and Cu 0.5Bi alloy. In accordance with JEC 181 test method, impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out with a 30 mm inter contact gap. The vacuum interrupters showed 400 kV withstand voltage against both positive and negative impules with a 10 kV deviation. After 10 times interrupting 60 kA current of rated 12 kV, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing the same results. After continuously 100 times opening and closing a circuit through which 80A leading small current of rate 12 kV flowed, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing substantially the same results. Table 6 below shows the results of the tests of the impulse withstand voltage at rated 84 kV tests which were carried out on the vacuum interrupters of the 29th embodiment of the present invention and on them of the 13th and 14th comparatives. The same as in item 8 . In accordance with a lagging small current interrupting test of JEC 181, a 30A test current of was flowed through the stationary and movable contact electrodes 24 and 13. Current chopping values had a 3.9A average however, σ In particular, current chopping values of the vacuum interrupters of the 30th, 33rd and 36th embodiments of the present invention had a 3.7A average however, σ The same as in item 10 . The following limits were apparent on a composition ratio of austinitic stainless steel in the complex metals for the arc diffusing portion of the 29th to 37th embodiments of the present invention. Austinitic stainless steel below 30 by weight significantly increased the electrical conductivity to generate large eddy current but lowered the mechanical strength and durability of the arc diffusing portion 20, so that the arc diffusing portion 20 had to be thickened. On the other hand, austinitic stainless steel above 70 by weight significantly lowered interruption performances. The vacuum interrupters of the 29th to 37th embodiments of the present invention possess more current interrupting capability than a conventional vacuum interrupter of the axial magnetic field type and dielectric strength as high as that of the vacuum interrupter of the 13th comparative. Arc diffusing portions 20 of the 38th and 40th embodiments are each made of complex metal consisting of a porous structure of austinitic stainless steel including many holes of axial direction through the arc diffusing portions 20 at an areal occupation ratio of 10 to 90 , and copper or silver infiltrating the porous structure of austinitic stainless steel. This metal composition possesses 5 to 30 IACS electrical conductivity, at least 30 kgf mm Complex metals for the arc diffusing portion of the 38th to 40th embodiments of the present invention were produced by the following process. At first, a plurality of pipes of austinitic stainless steel, e.g., SUS304 or SUS316 and each having an outer diameter within 0.1 to 10 mm and a thickness within 0.01 to 9 mm are heated at a temperature below a melting point of the austinic stainless steel in a nonoxidizing atmosphre, e.g., a vacuum, or hydrogen, nitrogen or argon gas, thus bonded to each other so as to form a porous matrix of a circular section. Then, the resultant porous matrix of the circular section is placed in a vessel made of material, e.g., alumina ceramics, which interacts with none of the austinitic stainless steel, copper and silver. All the bores of the pipes and all the interstices between the pipes are infiltrated with copper or silver in the nonoxidizing atmosphere. After cooling, a desired complex metal for the arc diffusing portion was resultant. In place of the pipes in the third infiltration process, a plate of austinitic stainless steel and including many holes at an areal occupation ratio of 10 to 90 is used as a porous matrix. On the same subsequent steps as those of the third infiltration process, a desired complex metal for the arc diffusing portion was resultant. Contact making portions of the 38th to 40th embodiments of the present invention are made of complex metal of the same composition as that of the complex metal of the 2nd to 10th embodiments of the present invention. Example A₁₃ of a complex metal for the arc diffusing portion possesses a composition consisting of 60 austinitic stainless steel SUS304 by weight and 40 copper by weight. Example A₁₃ of the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion 20 and Examples C When performances of the vacuum interrupters of the 39th and 40th embodiments of the present invention differ from those of the 38th embodiment of the present invention, then different points shall be specified. Interruption tests which were carried out at an opening speed within 1.2 to 1.5 m s under a rated voltage of 12 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 21 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted 65 kA current. Moreover, interruption tests at an opening speed of 3.0 m s under a rated voltage of 84 kV, however, a transient recovery voltage of 143 kV according to JEC 181, established that the test vacuum interrupters interrupted 55 kA current. Table 7 below shows the results of the large current interrupting capability tests. Table 7 also shows those of the vacuum interrupters of the 15th and 16h comparatives which include a pair of contact electrodes each consisting of an arc diffusing portion and a contact making portion each having the same sizes as those of the arc diffusing portions and the contact making portions of the contact electrodes of the 3rd to 8th comparatives. The arc diffusing portion and the contact making portion of the 15th comparative are respectively made of Example A₁₃ and 20Cu 80W alloy. Those of the 16th comparative, of Example A₁₃ and Cu 0.5Bi alloy. In accordance with JEC 181 test method, impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out with a 30 mm inter contact gap. The results showed 400 kV withstand voltage against both positive and negative impules with a 10 kV deviation. After 10 times interrupting 65 kA current of rated 12 kV, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing the same results. After continuously 100 times opening and closing a circuit through which 80A leading small current of rated 12 kV flowed, the same impulse withstand voltage tests were carried out, thus establishing substantially the same results. Table 8 below shows the results of the tests of the impulse withstand voltage at rated 84 kV tests which were carried out on the vacuum interrupters of the 38th embodiment of the present invention and those of the 15th and 16th comparatives. The same as in item 8 The same tests as in item 19 established that the vacuum interrupters of the 38th, 39th and 40th embodiments of the present invention had respective 3.9A σ The same as in item 10 . In the complex metal for the arc diffusing portion of the 38th to 40th embodiments of the present invention, the areal occupation ratio below 10 of many holes of axial direction in the plate of austinitic stainless steel significantly decreased the current interrupting capability, on the other hand, the areal occupation ratio above 90 thereof significantly decreased the mechanical strength of the arc diffusing portion and the dielectric strength of the vacuum interrupter. The vacuum interrupters of the 38th and 40th of the present invention possess more improved high current interrupting capability than those of other embodiments of the present invention. A vacuum interrupter of an axial magnetic field applying type of the present invention, of which a contact making portion of a contact electrode is made of complex metal consisting of 20 to 70 copper by weight, 5 to 70 chromium by weight and 5 to 70 molybdenum by weight and of which an arc diffusing portion of the contact electrode is made of material below, possesses more improved large current interrupting capability, dielectric strength, anti welding capability, and lagging and leading small current interrupting capabilities than a conventional vacuum interrupter of an axial magnetic feld applying type. There may be listed as a material for an arc diffusing portion austinitic stainless steel of 2 to 3 IACS electrical conductivity, at least 49 kgf mm As used in this specification the term IACS will be understood to be an abbreviation of international annealed copper standard , i.e., an annealed electrolytically refined copper processing a purity of 99,96 to 99,98, which exhibits a resistivity of 1,7241 µ ohm cm at 20 C. The conductivity of the IACS is defined as 100, and the percentage values used in this specification are percentages of this value. The term IACS electrical conductivity is used to define percentage conductivity. The term percentage conductivity may sometimes be more popular than the term IACS electrical conductivity .
