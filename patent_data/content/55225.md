# A contrivance for playing hoop and stick.

## Abstract
Outfit for playing hoop and stick consisting of a hoop 1 or circular disc or thin wheel, and at least one implement 2 equipped with a hand grip 3 by means of which an individual may grasp the same. The implement is provided with a recess 4 designed to accept and encompass a portion of the hoop or outside edge of the disc, or wheel , from the outer, and partly from each lateral side. The envisaged function of the implement, once gripped by the individual, is that of stopping the hoop this thrown so as to cause its rolling along a given surface holding the same in a practically vertical position, and throwing the hoop in like manner so as to cause its being rolled once more upon and along the said surface.

## Description
A Contrivance for playing hoop and stickThe invention described herein is a contrivance for playing hoop and stick. It is envisaged for use by one or more individuals, ideally two, who throw a hoop, or disc, or thin wheel one to the other by causing the same to roll along the ground, using a suitable implement with which to accept, and hold the hoop in a practically vertical position and thus to throw it. To this end the invention is characterised by the fact that it comprises apart from the hoop, or circular disc or thin wheel at least one implement equipped with a hand grip and designed to be grasped by an individual, the said implement being provided with a recess serving to accept and encompass a part of the hoop, or outside edge of the disc, or wheel , from the outside, and in part from a lateral direction.The envisaged function of the implement and hoop combined, once the former is gripped by the individual, is that of the implement s stopping and holding the said hoop, or said disc, or wheel , thrown and caused to roll along the surface, that is along the ground , in a practically vertical position, as well as throwing the said hoop, or disc, or wheel so as to cause its being rolled along the said surface or ground.The combined elements of the invention offer an extremely simple and easy to use contrivance designed to create a vigorous and enjoyable physical pastime.Further advantages and features of the invention described herein will become apparent from the detailed description which follows of a preferred, though not exclusive form of embodiment, illustrated by way of unlimited example in the enclosed drawings, in whichFig 1 illustrates the invention s use schematically Fig 2 shows a first form of embodiment of a contrivance to which the invention relates, for use by two individuals as in Fig 1 Fig 3 shows the front face view of one of the two implements composing the embodiment illustrated in Fig 2 Fig 4 shows a lateral view of Fig 3Fig 5 shows a second form of embodiment of a contrivance of the kind to which the invention relates Fig 6 shows a part of the rightangle cross section executed according to a radial plane relative to the contrivance in Fig 2 Fig 7 shows a part of the rightangle cross section executed according to the radial plane of a hoop having o a different profile and forming part of a contrivance of the kind to which the invention relates.With reference to the drawings mentioned above, a hoop is indicated by 1 whose rightangle cross section, relative to a radial plane, is shown in Fig 6. 2 denotes an implement, provided with a hand grip 3 positioned uppermost, and incorporating at least one recess 4 designed to accept and encompass a portion of the hoop 1 from the same s outer edge so as to embrace part of the lateral surfaces thereof. The recess 4 is fashioned in the form of a channel, whose curvilinear axis corresponds to a circumferential arc. The bending radius of the recess 4 base is equivalent to the outermost circumferential curvature of the hoop 1 surface. The said channel shaped recess has, in part, and with respect to that plane containing its curvilinear axis, a constant and symmetrical rightangle cross section.The opposed lateral walls 6 of the recess 4 are profiled in such a way as to accommodate a portion of the hoop 1 therebetween and embrace the same laterally. The opposed lateral walls 6 diverge outwards at their actual edges so as to facilitate the entry, and subsequent insertion, of the hoop 1 into the recess 4. The envisaged function of the imple ment 2 is that of combining with the hoop, and more particularly , by way of its hand grip 3 being gripped by an individual, the latter using it to accept and stop the hoop 1, holding the same in practically vertical position, the said hoop 1 having been thrown so as to roll along a given surface, generally the ground.The same mplement 2 grasped in like manner serves to throw the hoop 1, directing it along the surface towards a second individual equipped with an identical impale ment 2.The implement 2 allows correct positioning of the hoop 1 prior to the latter s being thrown firmly and accurately so as to roll along the surface.In like manner the implement 2 allows accurate and safe receipt of the rolling hoop , and holding of same on the surface in a practically vertical position, ready for a fresh throw.Fig 5 illustrates a further form of embodiment of the invention in which the hoop 1 is substituted by a wheel 7 furnished with spokes 8, and theimplement 2 replaced by an implement 9 having identical function, though provided with a ch annel shaped recess 4 of notably reduced length with respect to that embodied in the first implement 2. A further form of embodiment could comprise a solid disc with circular outline, in place of the hoop 1 or spoked wheel 7. The outer edge of any such disc, hoop 1 or wheel 7 would normally be fashioned with rightangle radial cross section symmetrical , with respect to the plane containing its geometrical axis, the said crosssection s outward facing profile being curved, rounded, and convex. Further forms of embodiment besides may, in the crosssections of the outer edge of the relative disc, hoop 1 or wheel 7 executed according toa radial plane, show the outward facing edge s symmetrical profile tapering into a cusp, as demonstrated in Fig 7. Numeróus m3diìcationsofapraffltical nature may be applied to the constructional details of the invention described thus, without there being a deviation from, and without straying outside the sphere of, the framework of protection afforded to the concept of the invention as described above, and as claimed below.
