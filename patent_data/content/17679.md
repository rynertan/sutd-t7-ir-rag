## Description
PYRIDYLALKYLPYRIMIDONE COMPOUNDS, PROCESS FOR PREPARINGTHEM AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to pharmacologically active pyridylalkylpyrimidone compounds, to a process for preparing them and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In German Offenlegungsschrift 2658267 a group of pyrimidones 1 are described as having histamine H1 andH2 antagonist activity.EMI1.1 In Structure l Het is a 2 or 4 imidazolyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl, halogen, trifluoromethyl or hydroxymethyl, a 2 pyridyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, amino or hydroxy, a 2 thiazolyl group, a 3 isothiazolyl group optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, a 3 1,2,5 thiadiazolyl group optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, or a 2 5 amino 1,3,4 thiadiazolyl group Y is sulphur or methylene Z is hydrogen or lower alkyl X is oxygen or sulphur W is methylene, oxygen or sulphur the sum of p and q is 1 to 4, or, when W is methylene, 0 to 4 and Hetl is a 5 or 6 membered heterocycle such as pyridine, furan, thiophene, thiazole, oxazole, isothiazole, imidazole, pyrimidine, pyrazine or pyridazine, which heterocycle is optionally substituted by lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, or can have a benzene ring or substituted benzene ring fused to it. One class of compounds described is that in which Retl is a 2 furyl, 2 thienyl, 2 pyridyl, 3 pyridyl, 4 pyridyl, 2 thiazolyl, 2 imidazolyl, 2 pyrimidyl, 2pyrazinyl or 3 pyridazyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl or lower alkoxy.We have found that a small group of compounds of the general class have improved therapeutic properties, and are less acutely toxic than other members of the general class. According to the invention there is provided a pyrimidone of Structure 2 EMI2.1 in which Ret is a 4 imidazolyl group optionally substituted by lower alkyl, halogen or trifluoromethyl, a 2 pyridyl group optionally substituted by one or more lower alkyl or lower alkoxy groups or halogen atoms, or a 2 thiazolyl group Y is sulphur or methylene Z is hydrogen or lower alkyl A is C1 C5 alkylene R is lower alkyl or lower alkoxy andR1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy. Throughout this specification by the terms lower alkyl 2nd lower alkoxy are meant alkyl and alkoxy groups which can be straight or branched and which contain from 1 two 4 carbon atoms. Particular lower alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, 1propyl and 2 propyl. Particular lower alkoxy groups are methoxy, ethoxy, l propoxy and 2 propoxy. The compounds of Structure 2 have particularly good histamine H1 and H2 antagonist activity and are less acutely toxic in mice when administered intravenously than the corresponding compounds of Structure 2 in whichR is hydrogen. This decrease in acute toxicity is in general not accompanied by a reduction in histamine H1antagonist activity or histamine H2 antagonist activity.For example the six specific compounds of Structure 1 2 4 3 methoxy 2 pyridyl butylamino 5 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone, 2 4 3 chloro 2 pyridyl butylamino 5 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone, 2 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone, 2 2 5 methy1 4 imidazoly1methylthio ethylaminoj5 6 methoxy 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone, 2 2 2 thiazolylmethylthio ethylamino i S 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone,and 2 2 3 bromo 2 pyridylmethylthio ethylamino 5 5,6 dimethyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone, when compared with the corresponding 5 3 pyridylmethyl analogues which lack the 6 substituent or 5 and 6substituents in the pyridyl group are approximately of equal potency as histamine H1 antagonists and histamine H2antagonists, but the former have at least three times theLD50 value of the latter. LD50 is the minimum dose which kills 50 of mice after bolus intravenous administration of the test compound . Preferably R is lower alkyl, especially methyl. When R is lower alkoxy, preferably it is methoxy. Preferably when R1 is lower alkyl or lower alkoxy it is in the 5 position of the pyridyl group, and especially R1 is the same as R. Preferably A is straight X, alkylene, particularly methylene. Preferably Z is hydrogen. Specific examples of Het2 are 5 methyl 4 imidazolyl, 5 bromo 4 imidazolyl, 5 trifluoromethyl 4 imidazolyl, 2pyridyl, 3 methyl 2 pyridyl, 3 methoxy 2 pyridyl, 3 ethoxy2 pyridyl, 3,4 dimethoxy 2 pyridyl, 3 chloro 2 pyridyl, 3 bromo 2 pyridyl, 3 bromo 4 methyl 2 pyridyl, and 2thiazolyl. Preferably Y is methylene and Het2 is a 2 pyridyl group optionally substituted by one or more lower alkyl or lower alkoxy groups or halogen atoms or a 2 thiazolyl group. Particularly preferably Y is methylene and Het2 is 2 pyridyl, 3 methoxy 2 pyridyl, 3 ethoxy 2 pyridyl, or 3 chloro 2 pyridyl,as these compounds have particularly good histamine B1 and H2 antagonist activity after either oral or intravenous administration. The compounds of Structure 1 are shown and described as 4 pyrimidone derivatives and these derivatives exist in equilibrium with the corresponding 6 one tautomers. These compounds also exist to a lesser extent as the hydroxy tautomers, and the pyrimidone ring may also exist in the following tautomeric forms EMI5.1 In a process of the invention compounds of Structure 2 are prepared by reacting an amine of Structure 3 where Het2 and Y are as defined above for Structure 2 with a compound of Structure 4 , Het2 CH2Y CH2 2NH2 3 EMI5.2 in which Z, A, R and R1 are as defined above for Structure 2 and Q is nitroamino N02NH , lower alkylthio, benzylthio, chlorine, bromine or other group which can be displaced with a primary amine. The reaction can be carried out at an elevated temperature in the absence of a solvent, for example at from 800 to 1700, preferably from 1200 to 1400, or in a solvent at an elevated temperature, for example t the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The choice of solvent is affected by solubility characteristics of the reactants and the nature of Q. Preferably the solvent is pyridine, a picolineor mixture of picolines, a lower alkanol, preferably ethanol or l propanol, an aqueous lower alkanol, 1,2 ethanediol, a ketone, for example acetone or 2 butanone, or a polar aprotic solvent, for example dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulphoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide, sulpholane, acetonitrile or nitromethane. Particularly preferably Q is nitroamino and the reaction is carried out in ref fluxing ethanol, refluxing 1 propanol or relfuxing pyridine, or Q is methylthio and the reaction is carried out in ref fluxing pyridine. Preferably approximately equimolar amounts of the reactants are used, although an excess, for example a slight excess of from 1.1 to 1.5 molar equivalents or a larger excess of from 1.5 to 4 molar equivalents, of either reactant can be used. If an excess of a reactant is used then preferably an excess of the amine of Structure 3 is used. An excess of either reactant can be present at the start of the reaction or can be added during the course of the reaction. The starting materials of Structure 4 can be prepared by reacting a p oxoester of Structure 5 EMI6.1 in which R2 is lower alkyl, with a nitroguanidine to give a compound of Structure 4 in which Q is nitroamino, or b thiourea followed by alkylation or benzylation to give a compound of Structure 4 in which Q is lower alkylthio or benzylthio, or c guanidine followed by diazotisation in hydrochloric acid in the presence of cuprous chloride and copper or by diazotisation in hydrobromic acid in the presence of cuprous bromide and copper to give a compound ofStructure 4 in which Q is chlorine or bromine. Preferably the reactions of the p oxoester of Structure 5 with nitroguanidine, thiourea and guanidlne are carried out in the presence of a base, for example, an alkali metal lower alkoxide, preferably sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide, an alkali metal carbonate or hydroxide, preferably potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride or a quaternary ammonium hydroxide, for example benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide. Preferably this reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature, for example the reflux temperature of the solvent mixture. Preferably the solvent is a lower alkanol, for example ethanol, an aqueous lower alkanol, a ketone, for example 2 butanone, or a polar aprotic solvent, for example dimethylformamide.When Z is hydrogen the oxoester of Structure 5 can be used in the form of a hemiacetal of a lower alkanol. The e oxoesters of Structure 5 in which Z is hydrogen can generally be prepared by formylating an ester ofStructure 6 EMI7.1 with a lower alkyl formate, for example ethyl formate, and a strong base, for example sodium hydride in 1,2 dimethoxyethane or tetrahydrofuran, or by using sodium in ether.Preferably in this reaction approximately two molar equivalents of ethyl formate and approximately two molar equivalents of sodium hydride are used. The p oxoesters of Structure 5 can be used in an upurified form or in some instances can be isolated and used as crystalline solids. The p oxoesters of Structure 5 in which Z is lower alkyl can be prepared by alkylating an acylacetate ester. The amines of Structure 3 in which Y is sulphur can be prepared by reacting cysteamine with a compound of formula Het2 CH2L where L is a group displaceable with a thiol, for example hydroxy, acyloxy for example acetoxy, methanesulphonyloxy or toluene p sulphonyloxy , lower alkoxy for example methoxy , chlorine, bromine or triarylphosphonium for example triphenylphosphonium . PreferablyL is hydroxy or methoxy and the reaction is carried out under acidic conditions, for example in hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. The amines of Structure 3 in which Y is methylene andHet2 is a 2 pyridyl group with a lower alkoxy group or halogen atom in the 3 position can be prepared by reacting a 2 halo 3 nitropyridine with diethyl 2 2 cyanoethyl malonate. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation of the product followed by reduction with palladium and charcoal gives a 3 amino 3 3 cyanopropyl pyridine which can be diazotised in 2M sulphuric acid and alkylated in dimethyl sulphoxide to give a 3 alkoxy 2 3 cyanopropyl pyridine. The 3 amino2 3 cyanopropyl pyridine can be reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to give a 4 3 amino 2 pyridyl butylamine, which can be diazotised in strong hydrochloric acid in the presence of cuprous chloride to give a 3 chloro amine, or diazotised in strong hydrobromic acid in the presence of cuprous bromide to give a 3 bromo amine, or diazotised in dilute sulphuric acid containing sodium iodide to give a 3 iodo amine. The 3 amino 2 3 cyanopropyl pyridines can be diazotised in fluoroboric acid and reduced with lithium aluminium hydride to give a 4 3 fluoro 2 pyridyl butylamine. The amines of Structure 3 in which Y is methylene andHet2 is a 2 thiazolyl group can be prepared by reacting a thioamide of structure NH2CS CH2 4Q, where Q is a protected amino group, with a dialkyl acetal of bromoacetaldehyde and subsequently converting the protected amino group to a free amino group. The esters of Structure 6 can be prepared by alkylating a dialkyl malonate followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation, or by condensing an aldehyde with malonic acid and decarboxylating, esterifying and reducing the product. In this specification by histamine H2 receptors is meant receptors defined by Black et al. Nature, 236, 385 1972 as those histamine receptors which are not blocked by mepyramine but are blocked by burimamide, and by histamineH1 receptors is meant receptors involved in mepyraminesensitive histamine responses. Compounds which block histamine H2 receptors are referred to as histamine H2antagonists and compounds which block histamine H1 receptors are referred to as histamine H1 antagonists. Blockade of histamine H2 receptors is of value in inhibiting the biological actions of histamine which are not inhibited by histamine H1 antagonists. Histamine H2antagonists are active, for example, as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, as antiinflammatory agents and as agents which act on the cardiovascular system, for example as inhibitors of the effects of histamine on blood pressure. In some physiological conditions the biological actions of histamine are mediated through both histamine H1 and H2receptors and blockade of both types of receptors is useful.These donditions include inflammation mediated by histamine, for example skin inflammation, and those hypersensitivity responses due to the action of histamine at H1 and H2receptors, for example allergies. The activity of the compounds of Structure 2 as histamine H2 antagonists can be demonstrated by the inhibition of histamine stimulated secretion of gastric acid from the lumen perfused stomachs of rats anaesthetised with urethane, at doses of less than 16 micromoles per kilogram intravenously. This procedure is referred to in Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmac. Chemother., 27, 427 1966 . Their activity as histamine H2 antagonists can also be demonstrated by their ability to inhibit other actions of histamine which, according to the above mentioned paper of Ash and Schild, are not mediated by histamine H1 receptors. For example, they inhibit the actions of histamine on the isolated guinea pig atrium and isolated rat uterus. They inhibit the basal secretion of gastric acid and also that stimulated by pentagastrinor by food.In a conventional test such as the measurement of blood pressure in the anaesthetised cat, at doses of from 0.5 to 256 micromoles per kilogram intravenously they inhibit the vasodilator action of histamine.The potency of these compounds is illustrated by the effective dose producing 50 inhibition of gastric acid secretion in the anaesthetised rat and the dose producing 50 inhibition of the histamine induced tachycardia in the isolated guinea pig atrium less than 10 4 Molar . The activity of the compounds of Structure 2 as histamine H1 antagonists can be demonstrated by the inhibition of histamine stimulated contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum. It is advantageous to administer a single compound having histamine H1 and H2 antagonist activity rather than to administer individual compounds having histamine H1 antagonist activity and histamine H2antagonist activity as difficulties arising from differing rates of absorption and pharmacokinetic characteristics are avoided. The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a pharmacologically active compound of Structure 2 which can be in the base form or in the form of an addition salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Such addition salts include those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, sulphuric and maleic acids and may conveniently be formed from the corresponding compounds of Structure 2 by standard procedures, for example by treating them with an acid in a lower alkanol or by the use of ion exchange resins to form the required salt either directly from the compound in the base form or from a different addition salt. The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be a solid or liquid. Examples of solid carriers are lactose, maize starch, potato starch or modified starches, dicalcium phosphate, terra alba, sucrose, celluloses, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate and stearic acid.Examples of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, alcohol, propylene glycol, polyetheylene glycols and water. If a solid carrier is used, the composition can be prepared in the form of a tablet, capsule containing powder orpellets, troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier in a unit dosage form is generally from about 25 mg to about 300 mg. If a liquid carrier is used, the composition can be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, multiple emulsion, sterile injectable liquid or an aqueous or non aqueous solution or liquid suspension. Other additives such as preservatives, for example antioxidants or antibacterials, and or flavouring or colouring agents can also be included.The sterile liquids can be prepared in ampoules, multidose vials or unit dose disposable systems. The preparation can also be in a semi solid form, for example a cream, paste, ointment or gel, or in a liquid or aerosol form for topical application. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques involving procedures such as milling, mixing, granulating and compressing, spray drying, freeze drying or dissolving or dispersing the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation. The active ingredient is present in the compositions in an effective amount to block histamine H2 receptors. Preferably each dosage unit contains from about 50 mg to about 250 mg of the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably administered from one to six times per day. The daily dosage regimen is preferably from about 150 mg to about 1500 mg. The route of administration can be oral or parenteral.
