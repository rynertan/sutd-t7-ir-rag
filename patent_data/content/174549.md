## Abstract
Means for identifying and recording bottles and or bottle hampers. The means comprises a light source 2 for illuminating the target being examined, such as a bottle hamper 3 and the bottles 4,5 therein, a camera 1 for examining momentarily said target 3,4,5 , a conveyor 6 for transporting said target 3,4,5 past the camera 1 and the light source 2 , and a data processing unit, to which the image produced by the camera is supplied after it has been transformed into digital form, for identifying the target 3,4,5 , and a recording means for recording the target 3,4,5 . The camera 1 , which is a semi conductor matrix camera, and the light source 2 emitting a lineal light bar have been so disposed in relation to the conveyor 6 that the light emitted by the light source 2 is reflected from the target 3,4,5 under examination on the conveyor to the camera 1 . Hereby, as the conveyor 6 transports the target 3,4,5 past the point of examination, the camera 1 delivers to the data processing unit images from several points of the target being examined, in the memory of the data processing unit being formed a synthetic, three dimensional picture of the target for identifying the characteristic features of the target.
