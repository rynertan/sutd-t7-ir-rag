# Method for the operation of a fuel cell.

## Abstract
An improved method for operating a fuel cell with a porous gas diffusion electrodes to which an oxidizing or reducing gas is fed. The method provides for the regeneration of the electrode by keeping the oxidizing or reducing gas temporarily at a reduced concentration level while substantially maintaining the overall pressure of the gas phase in situ of the electrode and while continuing power offtake at least for the period during which the concentration level is reduced.
