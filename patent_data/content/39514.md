# Apparatus for producing frozen confections.

## Abstract
An apparatus for producing frozen confections of the type including sticks projecting from a block of frozen confection material including a plurality of de tachable mold strips and a screw conveyor arrange ment for indexing the mold strips through a closed rect angular path in a horizontal plane with the mold cups of the mold strips opening upwardly. The conveyor includes cradles to which the mold strips are individ ually and pivotally mounted, a rectangular arrangement of tracks for guiding the cradles through the rectangular path of travel, and several conveyor screws which are driven continuously for propelling the cradles along the tracks. The conveyor screws have grooves therein adapt ed to cause the cradles to dwell under a confection fil ler, a stick inserter, a confection extractor and mold cleaning apparatus. Between the extractor and mold cleaning apparatus a photodetector unit is mounted to scan the row of mold cups of each strip as it is laterally transferred from the extracting lane to the filling lane, and a turn over device that is responsive to the photo detector unit is provided to invert only those mold strips found to contain confection material that was not re moved by the extractor. The confection material is then dislodged from the inverted cup by an air jet, and the inverted mold strip is returned to its original orientation with the cups depending from the strip so that confec tion material may subsequently be disposited therein.
