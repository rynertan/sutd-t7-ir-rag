# Automatic cold start devices for spark ignition internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An automatic cold start fuel supply device comprises a needle 67 movable with engine temperature by a bimetallic element 57 via a rotary member 51 . A spring 74 , which is normally compressed by the action of manifold depression on a diaphragm 72 , acts when expanded through the diaphragm 72 and a lever 76 on an arm 53 of the rotary member 51 . The geometry of the lever 76 and the rotary member 51 is such that the rotary member 51 is so positioned by the bime tallic element 57 when the engine is warm that it is not rotated by the load that is applied to its arm 53 by the action of the spring 74 whereas it is so rotated against the action of the bimetallic element 57 when the engine temperature is below the normal running temperature.
