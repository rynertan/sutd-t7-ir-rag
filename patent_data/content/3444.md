# Method and apparatus for video signal recording.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for video signal recording comprises helically scanning a plurality of transducer heads 20, 21 sequentially along separate parallel paths of equal width on a record medium 10 at a rate such that a plurality of the scans occur within a field interval, and diverting the signal in predetermined sequence to different ones of the heads. The scanning of said heads 20, 21 and diverting of the signal to different heads is arranged to cause some redundant recording of information in different ones of the paths, information recorded in a path that is adjacent an edge of the medium having corresponding redundant information recorded in an internal path that is bounded by other parallel paths. The apparatus includes a rotary scanner 12 having at least three transducer heads 20, 21, 22 spaced along and around the axis of rotation of the scanner whereby each head scans along a different circular orbit and at a different time across a segment of a cylindrical surface defined by the plural orbits, and a transport for moving a recording tape 10 across a segment of such cylindrical surface in timed relation to scanning rotation of the heads and at an angle to the axis of rotation such that each head traces a series of helical scans on the medium within non overlapping paths along the direction of motion of the medium. The heads 20, 21, 22 rotate at a speed sufficient to separate each scan of a head along the corresponding path.
