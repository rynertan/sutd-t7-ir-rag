# Method of cloning modified streptomycetes DNA.

## Abstract
A method of cloning endogenously modified Streptomy cetes DNA, which is normally rejected by restrictionless heterospecifc hosts, is disclosed. The method uses bacter iophage lambda to construct a genomic library of modified Streptomycetes DNA such lambda containing Streptomy cetes DNA is replicated to provide a source of non modified Streptomycetes DNA. This non modified DNA is subcloned into a selectable cloning vector and used to transform restrictionless heterospecific hosts. The transformants can then be screened for clones containing genes of interest.
