# In line annular piston fixed bolt regenerative liquid propellant gun.

## Abstract
A regenerative liquid propellant gun structure in which the differential area piston 6 is annular, having a peripheral cylindrical skirt 63 extending away from the combustion chamber 36 to define a propellant reservoir 35 , and has an aperture 62 permitting overrunning of a fixed bolt 5 . The fixed bolt 5 is shaped to define with the edge of the aperture 62 a variable annual orifice for propellant injection as the piston 6 moves. There is a second free piston 7 overrun ning the bolt 5 and mating with the inside of the differential area piston 6 to complete and provide for emptying of the reservoir 35 . The structure also contains a spring 46 to allow components to move responsive to increased combus tion chamber pressure to provide for an initial movement of differential area piston 6 relative to the bolt 5 to start propellant injection and a fluid pressure means for move ment of pistons 6, 7 after firings to facilitate reloading.
