# Alphanumeric display.

## Abstract
Digits of a multi digit alphanumeric display have eight segments, viz a conventional seven segment arrangement plus an eighth. The attitude position of the eighth segment differs from digit to digit, the pattern of variation being selected so that a limited repertoire of words and phrases can be displayed without the provision of full alphanumeric capability on all digits.
