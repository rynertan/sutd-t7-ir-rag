# RADIATION DETECTOR AND METHOD OF FABRICATING A RADIATION DETECTOR

## Abstract
A high speed PIN photodetector having high efficiency in the 900nm wavelength region consists of a parallel sided web 2ยน of silicon disposed obliquely between a parallel pair of strips 7 of silicon dioxide, opposite surface layers 3, 4 of the web being of different conductivity types and supporting contiguous radiation reflecting electrodes 5, 6 . Radiation may be detected through one or both of the strips 3, 4 of silicon dioxide or alternatively the radiation may be coupled to an end of the web via an optical fibre 23 . The web of silicon may be formed by anisotropically etching V grooves in both sides of a silicon substrate.
