# HETEROGENEOUS ESTERIFICATION CATALYST, PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION AND ITS USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF RESIDUE ESTERS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a heterogeneous catalyst com prising one or more metals having an atomic number greater than or equal to twelve in a physical form having a surface area greater than 0.0001 square feet gram coated with a compound of a metal of Group I to VIII of the Periodic Table other than tin and, optionally, a tin containing compound. Other aspects of the invention are a process for producing the catalyst and the use of the catalyst in the production of high boiling esters.
