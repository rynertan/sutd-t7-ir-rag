## Description
Long Chain Amine Derivatives THIS INVENTION relates to alkylated amines, to compositions based on these amn0. and to the manufacture and use of these amines and compositions. Compositions based on long chain amines and their derivatives have been proposed for e wide variety of uses, for example as fabric softening agent and as emulsifiers. However, such prior art compositions have not always been entirely satisfactory, for example because their degree of effectiveness is less than might be disired or because they are difficult to handle. We have now surprisingly found that certain long chain diamine derivatives and compositions based on them have some advantageous properties and a wide variety of uses. Accordingly, the present invention comprises alkylated diamine compounds having the formula EMI1.1 where R1, R2, R3 and R4 which may be the same or different, are selected from hydrogen and from alkyl groups containing from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2, R3 and R4 is not hydrogen, and where n is an integer in the range 2 to 12, preferably in the range 2 to 6. In preferred embodiments of this invention, one or more of the substituents R1, R2, R3 and R4 comprise s long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms, the amount of branching being in the range 30 to 70 . In particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the integer p is six. Particularly nreferred embodiments of this invention include compounds of formula EMI2.1 The alkylated diamine compounds according to this invention are conveniently prepared by reaction of one or more aldehydes R.CH0, where R is R1 R2, R3 2nd or R4, with an a,w diamine, for example hexamethylenediamine in the presence of a suitable catalyst for example a hydrogenation catalyst, for example nickel. The productN alkyl diamines obtained will depend on the aldehyde s used and also on the ratio of aldehyde s to ,w diamine in the reaction mixture.It is convenient to carry out the preparation of the alkylated diamine compounds in a suitable solvent. methanol, for example, is particularly suitable since not only is it readily miscible with water and usually with the diamine products but it is also readily separable by distillation from water and the products. A suitable method for preparing alkyl 1,3 propane diamine compounds of this invention i.e. n 3 in the formulaEMI2.2 involves adding a primary or secondary alkyl amine to acrylonitrile followed by hydrogenation of the resultant nitrile. The diamines obtained will generally have hydrogen atoms as R3 and RL but alkyl substitution in these positions can be achieved by further reaction, for example with aldehyd.es. The nroducts of this invention are useful in a number of , JS, for example as adhesion agents for bitumen, as bitumen emulsifiers, corrosion inhibitors, and fabric softeners. The compounds of this invention, their preparetion and use are further illustrated in the following Examples EXAMPLES 1 TO 3 A number of compounds according to this invention were prepared using the following general method. Hexamethylenediamine, methanol and a catalyst were heated in an autoclave under hydrogen. A mixture of C13 to C15 aldehydes was added over a period of time and the reaction mixture was then stirred at constant temperature and pressure for a further period. The mixture of C1 andC15 aldehydes had the composition all parts by weight Hydrocarbons 1.0 C11 aldehydes 1.4a, C13 aldehydes 66.5 C15 aldehydes 31.2 Unidentified heavy ends 1.9 After cooling, the product was filtered and the methanol was removed by evaporation at reduced pressure. Excess hexamethylenediamine was removed by distillation under reduced pressure.

To this was added 0.24g of the product of sample 1 and the mixture was stirred. Part of this treated bitumen was placed in a lightly stoppered flask and heated at 1350C for 5 days. 300g of era shed and dried granite chippings from theMountsorrel quarry, Leicestershire which passed 3 4 but were retained on 1 2 B.S. sieve were placed in a glass beaker and heated to 600C. The treated bitumen 15g was heated to 100 C and added to the chippings. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes to ensure that no uncoated spots remained on any chipping. The coated chippings were immediately thereafter placed in a glass jar, covered and allowed to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature. After this time sufficient demineralised water was added to cover the chippings to a depth of about 10 mm and the mixture was maintained at 400C for 3 hours. The percentage of stones coated with bitumen was then estimated to the nearest 55 . The test was repeated with bitumen which hed not been heat treated. For comparison, the test was repeated using bitumen containing 0.12 N tallowalkylpropane diamine and using bitumen containing no adhesion agent. The results of all these tests are summarised inTable 2, the figures being percentages of coated area on the chippings.

The amine mixture comprised approximately 55 to 75 C13 and approximately 35 to 25 C15 amines these percentages being. calculated on the total of long chain alkyl groups with approximately 40 to 55 wt straight chain and 60 to 45 wt 2 alkyl branched chain where the 2 alkyl r.roup is predominantly methyl. The mixture of mines and acrylonotrile was maintained 2t 700C for a further 2 hours. The resultant nitrile 1.25 Kg was warmed with 347g ammonia and 55g Raney nickel catalyst Nicatl 101 supplied byJoseph Crosfields and Sons Ltd in 460g methanol to 1200C and the pressure was raised to 90 atmospheres using hydrogen.After five hours, the liquid reaction product was cooled and analysed by potentiometric titration as 98 alkyl propane diamine as molecular weight 266 . Four sOg samples of dried granite chippings from the Nountsorrel quarry, Leicestershire which passed a inch sieve but which were retained by a l inch sieve were weighed into four 25Om1 beakers. Distilled water 2.5g was added to each sartiple and the chippings agitated until thoroughly wet. To each sample was added Lg of bitumen emulsion and the samples were left to cure at room temperature for 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours respectively. After curing, each sample was allowed to stand for 4 hours in 10 ml of distilled water. A visual assessment was made of the extent of bitumen coverage on the chippings.Emulsions giving 100 coverage after 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours were described respectively as quick, fast, medium, and slow breaking. As in Example 4, a comparison test was carried out using N tallowalkylpropane diamine. The results are shown in Table 3.
