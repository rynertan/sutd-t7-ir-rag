# Intake system of an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine in which an intake passage 4 and an exhaust 5 are juxtaposed adjacent to each other in a cylinder head and in which an intake valve 10 is arranged in a downstream end portion of said intake passage such that its valve stem 10b is disturbing the flow of intake air there is provided an auxiliary intake passage 18 which communicates with said intake passage downstream of said valve stem. This auxiliary intake passage indirectly expands the intake passage so that the flow rate of the intake air into the cylinder can be augmented to improve the output performance of the internal combustion engine.
