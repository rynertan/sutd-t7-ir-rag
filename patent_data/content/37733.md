# Microfilm flash illumination apparatus.

## Abstract
A microfilm flash illumination apparatus includes a light, housing 10 completely enclosed except for an aperture 24 in the bottom wall 22 . Microfilm or fiche images 28 are successively presented adjacent this aperture. The walls 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 of the housing are coated with a diffusely reflective material and cause light from a flash illumination source 8 mounted within the housing to diffusely illuminate the surface of the microimage adjacent the aperture 24 . The apparatus is especially suitable for use in a xerographic printer utilising a zoom lens 26 for reproducing microimages at a variable enlargement.
