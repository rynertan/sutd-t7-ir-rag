## Description
PROCESS FOR SEPARATING A CARBOXYLIC ACID FROM A MIXTURE THEREOFWITH WATER AND OR ONE OR MORE OTHER OXYGENATED ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to a process for separating a carboxylic acid from a mixture thereof with water and or one or more other oxygenated aliphatic compounds. In any process for separating components of a mixture by adsorption the adsorbent should possess the following properties 1. A high capacity for preferential adsorption, 2. A rapid rate of adsorption enabling the adsorbent to adsorb a significant amount of the desired component in a short time from a mixture with which it is contacted , and 3. A high selectivity for the desired component so that effective separation of the component from mixtures in which its concentration is low can be effected. A class of adsorbents which possess these properties is the crystalline aluminosilicates, the best known of which are the zeolites. The crystalline aluminosilicates function as molecular sieves , that is they contain pores having cross sectional diameters which will accept certain molecules in a mixture of molecules of specific size and shape while rejecting others. A particular type of synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate which has come to the fore in recent years both as a catalyst and as an adsorbent is the MFI type zeolite, which is defined in the Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types by Meier et al, published by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association 1978 . A typical MFI type zeolite is that known as ZSM 5 which is described and claimed in US Patent No 3702886 Mobil .A ZSN 5 type zeolite has the composition in terms of mole ratios of oxides 0.9 i 0.2 M2 nO Al203 5 loo SiO2 zH20 wherein M is a cation, n is the valency of the cation and z is fromO to 40 and a characteristic X ray diffraction pattern. Another type of material rapidly gaining acceptance as an adsorbent is that known as silicalite, which is a hydrophobic crystalline silica molecular sieve described and claimed in US Patent No 4061724 UnionCarbide . Silicalite is regarded by some see, for example, Nature,Vol 300, 25.11.82, page 309, Research article triggers dispute on zeolite by Stephen Budiansky as an extreme form of ZSM 5 in which the silicon to aluminium ratio is very high, for example about 500 1.In contrast to low silica to alumina molar ratio zeolites, due to its essentially aluminium free structure, silicalite does not show any detectable ion exchange behaviour, and is both hydrophobic and organophilic. The separation process utilising silicalite contemplated in US Patent No 4061724 comprises, in general terms, the separation of an organic compound from an aqueous solution. The organic molecules specifically exemplified are n butanol, methyl cello solve, methanol and phenol. In US Patent No 4367364 there is described a process for separating a normal paraffin from a mixture of the same with another structural class of hydrocarbon selected from the cyclic hydrocarbons having greater than six carbon atoms per molecule and the branched chain hydrocarbons, which comprises contacting said mixture at adsorption conditions with an adsorbent consisting essentially of silicalite to effect the selective adsorption of said normal aliphatic hydrocarbon by said adsorbent. In our copending unpublished UK application No 8222621 BP CaseNo 5405 there is described a process for the separation of ethanol from an aqueous solution thereof which comprises bringing the aqueous solution into contact with a zeolite which is a high silica zeolite wherein the molar ratio of silica to alumina is in the range 300 1 to 12 1. We have now found that a carboxylic acid can be separated from a mixture thereof with water and or one or more other oxygenated aliphatic compounds by contacting the mixture with either silicalite or an MFI type zeolite having a silica to alumina molar ratio greater than 50 1. This is surprising since there is no evidence to suggest that high silica MFI type zeolites possess sites which would have an especially strong affinity for the acidic carboxylic group. Accordingly, the present invention is a process for separating a carboxylic acid from a mixture thereof with water and or one or more other oxygenated aliphatic compounds which process comprises contacting the mixture under adsorption conditions with an adsorbent comprising either silicalite or an MFI type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite having a silica to alumina molar ratio greater than 50 1. As mentioned hereinbefore, the preparation and characterisation of silicalite is described in US Patent No 4061724, which is incorporated herein by reference. Silicalite may be prepared for example by the hydrothermal crystallisation of a reaction mixture comprising water, a source of silica and an alkylonium compound, suitably a quaternary ammonium hydroxide or salt, at a pH of 10 to 14 to form a hydrous crystalline precursor, and subsequently calcining that precursor to decompose alkylonium moieties present therein. Silicalite is the preferred adsorbent for use in the process of the invention. MFI type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites may suitably be prepared by crystallisation for a time greater than 0.5 hr at a temperature in the range from 80 to 2200C, preferably from 120 to 175or, from a gel comprising i a source of silica six2 ii a source of alumina A1203 , iii a mineralising agent selected from oxides and salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals X2 bO wherein b is the valency of X , v an organic base B , as hereinafter defined, and vi water and or alcohol ROH . The term organic base as used hereinbefore means any organic material for which 1010K for the reaction B H20 BH OHis less than 7, where K BH i OH i Bi Suitable organic bases include i tetrahydrocarbylammonium salts of the formula R1R2R3R4N X wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently either aryl, substituted aryl, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl or hydrogen and X is an inorganic anion. Preferably R1, R2, R3 and R4 are alkyl groups containing from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Preferably X is a halide or hydroxide ion. Suitable tetraalkylammonium salts include tetraethylammonium hydroxide and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide. Alternatively, the precursors of tetraalkylammonium compounds may be used. ii amines having the formula either R1R2R3N, or R1R2N CH2 xNR3R4 wherein x is an integer in the range 1 to 20, or RlR2N CH2 yN CH2 zNR3R4 wherein y and z are integers in the range 1 to 20. Suitable amines include C1 to Cg primary monoalkyl amines, such as n ethylamine, n propylamine and n butylamine. iii Mono , di and tri alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine, or their precursors in the form of an alkylene oxide and ammonia. iv aqueous ammonia. Suitable sources of silica include, for example, sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silica sol and silicic acid.The preferred source of silica is an aqueous colloidal dispersion of silica particles. A suitable commercially available source of silica is LUDOX Colloidal Silica manufactured by DuPcnt Registered Trade Mark . Suitable sources of alumina include, for example, sodium aluminate, aluminium sulphate and alumina. The preferred source of alumina is sodium aluminate prepared by dissolving pErticulate alumina in excess sodium hydroxide solution. The preferred mineralising agents are alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides and halides, such as for example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium bromide and calcium bromide. The preferred mineralising agent is sodium hydroxide. It will be appreciated that each source of silica, alumina, alkali or alkaline earth metal can be supplied by one or more initial reactants and then mixed together in any order. For example, sodium silicate is a source of both alumina and silica and an aluminosilicate is a source of both alumina and silica. Thus, the source of alumina and the source of silica may be supplied in whole or in part by an aluminosilicate, which may be either crystalline or amorphous. Specific MFI type zeolites and processes for their production utilising organic bases are described in US Patent Nos 3702886 3709979, 4205053, 4116099, 4139600 and 4151189 UK PatentNos 1365318 and 1567948 and European patent application publicationNos 2899 and 2900, for example. Alternatively, the organic base may be replaced by a source of ammonium ions as described in our European patent application publication No 30811, US Patent No 4119556 and UK application publication No 2018232A. The cations normally associated with the zeolites, for example alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal ions, organic nitrogen ions and ammonium ions may suitably be exchanged with other cations, for example hydrogen ions, using conventional techniques. Furthermore, it is desirable to calcine the zeolite, suitably by heating, for example in a stream of air, at a temperature in the range from 400 to 600 C for at least 0.5 hour. It is to be noted that the separation of the mixtures is dependent on the heat of adsorption of the components in the mixture with respect to the adsorbent used. The heat of adsorption is related not only to the amount of the mixture adsorbed from a given solution and the type of adsorbent used but also on the rate of adsorption. Thus for ethanol and acetic acid, the amounts of adsorption on silicalite are not very different when these compounds are adsorbed from a 10g litre solution in water but the heat of adsorption for acetic acid is very much higher which indicates that the rate of adsorption of the acid is much higher than it is for ethanol the converse applies for the rate of desorption. The process of the invention is applicable to both the separation of a carboxylic acid from an aqueous solution thereof or for the separation of a carboxylic acid from a mixture thereof with one or more other oxygenated aliphatic compounds. Examples of such other oxygenated aliphatic compounds include other carboxylic acids, alcohols, esters, ketones and aldehydes. The carboxylic acid to be separated and the other oxygenated aliphatic compounds suitably contain 1 8 carbon atoms. The process is particularly suited for separating a carboxylic acid from other carboxylic acids or for concentrating a dilute aqueous solution of the carboxylic acid.Suitable carboxylic acids which may be separated in the aforesaid manner may be selected from formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and mixtures thereof. The process of the invention may suitably be applied to relatively dilute aqueous solutions of the carboxylic acid to be separated, for example solutions containing less than 70Z by weight of the carboxylic acid, more preferably less than 10Z by weight. It has been found that the adsorption of the carboxylic acids increases markedly with the size of the alkyl group attached to the carboxylic acid group. In a particular aspect therefore the present invention provides a process for separating a Cx carboxylic acid from a mixture thereof with one or more Cy carboxylic acids, where x and y are integers such that y is greater than x, which process comprises contacting the mixture under adsorption conditions with an adsorbent comprising either silicalite or an MFI type crystalline amino silicate having a silica to alumina molar ratio greater than 50 1. Typically x is 1 and y is an integer from 2 8 preferably from 2 to 4.Thus, a mixture of carboxylic acids which may be separated by the process of the invention is that obtained by the oxidation of paraffinic hydrocarbons at elevated temperature and pressure which typically comprises formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and traces of butyric acid or such mixtures obtained during product work up. The process may be operated using the mixture to be separated in the liquid phase or the gaseous phase. The conditions used for adsorbing the mixture on the adsorbent will depend upon a the nature of the adsorbent, b the components in the mixture to be adsorbed, c the concentration of the acid to be separated in the mixture and d the type of carboxylic acid to be separated. For instance if a carboxylic acid is to be concentrated from an aqueous solution thereof, such a solution is preferably adsorbed on the adsorbent at a pressure from 1 to 50 bars, a temperature from above the freezing point of the solution to 200 C, most preferably from 5 1000C for an acid concentration from 0.1 99g litre, most preferably from 1 50g litre. The separated carboxylic acid may be recovered from the adsorbent by contact with a suitable solvent desorbent which displaces the carboxylic acid from the adsorbent, or by heating the adsorbent. Examples of the solvent desorbents that may be used include water, an alcohol such as ethanol, an ester such as ethyl acetate or other solvents which are more strongly adsorbed on the adsorbent than the acid to be separated. For example acetic acid adsorbed at 250C is rapidly desorbed with water at 100 C. Alternatively, desorption can be carried out from vapour phase and the acid recovered from the adsorbent by the application of heat and or reduced pressure. The adsorbent may be employed in the form of a dense compact fixed bed which is alternately contacted with the feed mixture and desorbent materials. In the simplest embodiment of the invention the adsorbent is employed in the form of a single static bed in which case the process is only semi continuous. In an alternative embodiment, two or more static beds are employed, the feed mixture being passed through one or more adsorbent beds at the same time as the desorbent is passed through one or more other beds. It is preferred to employ the adsorbent in the form of a countercurrent moving bed or in a simulated moving bed countercurrent flow system, the principle of which is described inUS Patent No 2985589. The process of the present invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following Examples. In the Examples the following apparatus, method and adsorbents were employed.Apparatus and Method The apparatus was a commercially available flow calorimeter manufactured by Microscal Limited and fitted with syringe micropumps manufactured under the trade name PERFUSOR IV by B. BrownMelsungen AG. The adsorbents used in the experiments were saturated with triply distilled water. Adsorption experiments were carried out as described in Groszek, A.J., Proc. Roy. Soc. A., 1970, 314, 473 498.A 1X wt wt solution of carboxylic acid in water lOg litre of water was percolated through the adsorbents typically about 100 mg at the rate of 0.05 ml per minute and the temperature of the solution was maintained at 220C f C. As the volume of the adsorbent bed in the cell is about 0.1 ml, the space velocity of the percolating water is about 30 h 1. The adsorbent S were used without any previous degassing treatments ie as taken out of bottles where they were stored under air. The rises of temperature taking place in the adsorbent through which solutions were percolated were measured by thermistors inserted in the adsorbent and registered by a chart recorder.Calibration was carried out by passing electrical current through a coil immersed in the centre of the adsorbent beds with the solvents percolating through them. The estimates of the amount of adsorption were carried out by measuring the time taken for the heat evolution to reach its maximum value, doubling it and assuming that during that time all the solute percolated through the adsorbent is adsorbed. The time interval in question usually corresponds to the major proportion of all the heat evolved during the adsorption process, ie the heat of adsorption without the adsorption tail . The amounts of the solutes adsorbed calculated in this way are of course not very accurate, but give nevertheless some idea of the capacity of the solids to adsorb the solutes under the flow conditions, ie most probably non equilibrium conditions. Adsorbent sA. MFI type crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites Gels of molar composition XSiO2 A1203 5.09 NaOH 333.6 H20 where x 20 to 50 were prepared and crystallised for 72 hours at 1700C 10C. A typical preparation of a high purity MFI NH3 zeolite using such a formulation is as follows. 3.66g 44.7 mmols of sodium aluminate was added to a solution of 2.68g 67 mmols of sodium hydroxide in 80.6g of deionised water and the mixture stirred for 30 min at room temperature during which time complete dissolution occurred Solution A . A second solution B was prepared meanwhile by adding 1.39g of aqueous ammonia to 85.8g of Ludox AS 40 colloidal silica. This solution was always prepared 25 min after the preparation ofSolution A so that it was stirred for 5 min only. As soon as the solutions A and B were ready Solution B was added to Solution A with rapid stirring. On mixing, a thick, opaque gel was formed which quickly became mobile with further stirring.After 10 min had elapsed 80 ml of the gel was placed in a clean 100 ml stainless steel pressure vessel which was immediately sealed and clamped to a rotating shaft in the crystallisation oven. The vessel was slowly rotated while being heated to 1700C, maintained at this temperature for 72 hours and then rapidly cooled to room temperature. When the pressure vessel was opened the product generally was a white solid suspended in an aqueous medium. The solid was rapidly separated from the mother liquor by filtration and washed with 400 ml of deionised water. The raw zeolite so obtained was dried to constant weight at 1200C.B. Silicalite 60g of Ludox AS 40, an ammonium stabilised silica sol, was added, with stirring, to 60g of aqueous tetrapropylammonium hydroxide 5X weight . After stirring for approximately 10 min, the mixture was placed in a 150 ml stainless steel pressure vessel and heated to 1700C for 60 hours under autogenous pressure. On cooling, the vessel was opened and the raw product separated from the mother liquor by filtration. The solid filter cake was then dried to constant weight at 1200C in an oven. Before use, a sample of the silicalite was calcined in air at 5000C for 60 hours. Powder X ray diffraction analysis of the calcined 6maple howBd it to be pure crystalline silicalite with no detectable amounts of a rphous material or other zeolite phases.Example 1 The aforesaid method was used for determining the heat of adsorption, ie the heat evolved when water is displaced from the adsorbent, for formic acid using as adsorbent an MFI NH3 zeolite prepared as hereinbefore described and having a Si Al atomic ratio of 47 1, ie a silica to alumina molar ratio of 53.2 1. The amount of formic acid adsorbed was also estimated. The results are given in Table 1.Example 2 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that formic acid was replaced by acetic acid. The results are given in Table 1. Example 3 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that formic acid was replaced by propionic acid.

The results are given in Table 2.Comparison Test 3 The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that theMFI NH3 zeolite having a silica to alumina molar ratio of 53.2 1 was replaced by an MF1 NH3 zeolite having a silica to alumina molar ratio of 19.2 1 Atomic ratio of 17 1 and formic acid was replaced by acetic acid.
