## Description
A CtrI rThG DEVICE FOR ASPHALTS OR CEMENT FOUNDATIONS This invention relates to a cutting device for asphalts and cement foundations.It is well known that in order to insert tubes or ducts in a paved foundation or to carry out pulldowns or repairs on the road, it is first necessary to cut in the road surface, then pride to remove the foundation.This cut in has been made hitherto by using a pneumatic hammer which drills a closely spaced apart series of holes. Although efficient, this is a very slow and accordingly expensive operation.It has also been attempted to use a specific machine provided with a powered toothed circular blade. This is a very complex and accordingly costly machine. It is also liable to a very rapid wear of the blades, so that it is seldan used, the road builders preferring to use the conventional pneumatic hammer.Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to provide a simple and efficient cutting device enabling to cut the asphalt or cement foundation at a reduced cost.The above object has been achieved by providing to cut the asphalt and cement foundations by means of a disc blade idly mounted on a self propelled implement which presses the blade against the ground.Conveniently, the thrust against the ground is provided by means of the bucket of an excavator, or the loading shovel, or even by the aid of a hydraulic piston which is mounted and operated by the self propelled implement.In case, it is also provided to mount two cutting blades in series when a cut of considerable depth is required.It is also possible to mount two cutting blades in parallel relationship, so that two side by side cuts can be made at a same time and at a predetermined distance one fran the other.Preferably the cutting blade is made of a hardened tempered steel alloy.The invention will now be further explained with reference to sane exemplary embodiments shown in the acoompany mg drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side view of the proposed device as mounted on an excavator Fig. 2 is a front view of the device shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 2a is a front view of a variant for the cutting blade Fig. 3 is a view showing a further device Fig. 4 is a side view of a device carrying two cutting blades arranged in series relationship for carrying out a deep cut Fig. 5 is a view showing a further embodiment andFig. 6 is a front view of a further device, having two blades mounted side by side thereon for siuultaneously providing two cuts at a predetermined distance one fram the other.Referring first to Figs. 1 and 2, it will be seen that the cutting blade 10 is in the shape of a disc and is idle mounted onto a support 11 by means of a bail or roller bearing or also by means of a case hardened steel ring nut not shown . It is supported by flanges 12. Centrally, said blade 10 is of uniform thickness at the central zone 1 ova, along which it is in contact with said two flanges 12. Fran this zone, the disc blade extends with a profile having a tapered section, in which each wall 10b has an inclination of about 50 with respect to the diametrical plane X X of blade 10.Instead, the end portions 1 oC immediately near the cutting tip 10d have an inclination of about 450, as clearly shown in Fig. 2.A cutting blade 10 Fig. 2a having only a single tapered portion 10f departing from central flat zone 1ova provided in front of flange 12 may also be foreseen.As it will e seen from Fig. 1, also showing the bucket B of an excavator, the support or frame 11 for the cutting blade is directly attached to the bucket teeth and it is such a bucket that with its piston P presses against the ground causing the cutting blade 10 to penetrate into the asphalt or conglomerate foundation.As shown in fig. 3, the downward thrust could also be imparted by a piston 15 acting on the support 21. Here the blade 20, in this case toothed, is also idle mounted in the support or bearing z and penetration thereof is provided by piston 15. The frame 22 supporting or carrying said piston 15 and support 21 can be the bearing foot of an excavator or other means which trails the cutting blade.When a deeper penetration into the asphalt or concrete foundation is required, two cutting blades 10 will be mounted in series relationship, as shown in Fig. 4. In this case, both blades 10 carried by a support 31 will be pressed downward by said piston 15, which is mounted on said frame 22, similarly as disclosed in connection with Fig. 3. A further embodiment has been shown in Fig. 5. Therein, the blade holder support 41 comprises a triangular portion pivoted at one of its apexes 42 to the frame 23, whereas another apex 43 thereof is operated by the rod 16 of a piston, the third apex 44 being connected to the pin 13 of said blade 10.Finally, a further approach is that shown in Fig. 6. According to this, two cutting blades 10 are mounted side by side and carried by two supports 51, which are fixed, after adjustment, at a predetermined distance to a transverse bar 52 having holes 53 to which supports 51 are bolted.Bar 52 can thus define the distance between the two blades 10 to provide a dual cut at a predetermined distance.
