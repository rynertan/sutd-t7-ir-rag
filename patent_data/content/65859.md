# Robotic manipulator structure.

## Abstract
A robotic manipulator structure including a base sup porting first and second independently operable drive motors 16 and 18, a first swinging arm rotatably supported by the base and driven from the first drive, a second swinging arm 42 supported for rotation at the end of the first arm for rotation through a plane translationally displaced from the plane in which the first arm rotates, and a mechanism for coupling the rotation of the second drive motor 18 through the hollow shaft 50 concentrically located and rotatable within the hollow shaft 38, and through a sprocket and chain arrangement in the hollow 58 of the first arm to independently effect the rotation of the second arm 42. When the first and second swinging arms move arcuate ly, it does not involve any physical bodily movement of the drive motors. The second arm at its distal end carries a workhead which is able to perform a predetermined func tion.
