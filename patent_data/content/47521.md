# Particulate material level sensing apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a particle level sensing apparatus which comprises a particle container 4 at least two electrodes 12, 13, 14 disposed at a predetermined position in the container for providing a capacitance therebetween, an element OSCâ‚‚, DET for detecting a change in the capacitance which occurs depending on whether or not the particles are present between the electrodes, and an element 15 for imparting vibration to at least one of the two electrodes thereby preventing adhesion of the particles to the electrodes.
