# Method of producing color filters and image pick up devices using them.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of producing color filters, which comprises forming a layer of an organic polymeric material having a predetermined light sensitive characteristic on a substrate 21 exposing this layer to a predetermined pattern, developing the exposed layer to form a filter base 24 and dyeing the filter base 24 , wherein after the development of the exposed layer, the layer is wetted with a dehydrating agent 25 to remove water from the filter base 24 . By this dehydrating treatment, the filter base 24 can be produced without distortion to a very high precision. The dehydrating agent 25 can be an anhydrous or water diluted alcohol, such as methanol.
