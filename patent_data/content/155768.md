# CONTAMINATION REMOVAL SYSTEM AND METHOD

## Abstract
A system and method for removing contamidated fluid from the ground in which water is pumped through a perforated pipe system into the ground to be decontamin ated. The water and the contaminants are then drawn into a removal pipe system and to a treatment unit for separating the contaminants from the water before the latter is returned to the first perforated pipe system. According to an alterna tive embodiment the water is drawn into the removal pipe system by producing a high velocity stream of water using a venturi device and passing the stream over the upper end of the removal conduit. The vacuum created by the high velocity stream causes the water to flow into the removal conduit system.
