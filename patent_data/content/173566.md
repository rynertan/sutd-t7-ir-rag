# MULTI LAYERED MATERIAL HAVING GRADED PROPERTIES

## Abstract
A multi layer material is disclosed in which the layers forming the structure are made of semiconductor or insulator material with conduction and valence band edge energies that are spatially periodic due to the compositional modula tion associated with the individual layers, the structure having at least two periodic repeat distances and the ma terial formed from tetrahedrally bonded elements or alloys containing said tetrahedrally bonded elements.
