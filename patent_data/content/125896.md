# Shaft seals.

## Abstract
A shaft seal comprises a housing 22 containing a sealing ring 20, 720 consisting of a sleeve 24, 724 of plastics such as PTFE and an elastomeric ring 30, 730 surrounding the sleeve. The dimensions of the sleeve 22, 722 are such that fluid can leak between the sleeve and the shaft 10 . Fluid pressure is applied to the elastomeric ring 24, 724 to apply radial force to the sleeve 22, 722 to reduce the leakage of fluid to an acceptable level whilst maintaining a hydrodynam ically stable fluid film between the sleeve and the shaft. The energising fluid pressure may be supplied from a separate source, or be derived from the system fluid pressure, for example by allowing the fluid to flow through ports 780 in the elastomeric ring 730 to the annular space 748 between the elastomeric ring and the housing. The fluid film between the sealing ring and the shaft reduces wear on the ring and shaft and reduces the heat generated by friction between the ring and the shaft.
