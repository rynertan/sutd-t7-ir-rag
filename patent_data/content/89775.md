# Method for manufacturing optical type recording medium.

## Abstract
A specific laser sensitive layer 12 is formed on a substrate 10 so as to manufacture an original disk 18 . The laser sensitive layer 12 absorbs energy from a laser beam 15 and locally expands and deforms. The laser beam 15 which has a predetermined beam energy to indicate pretrack information for, for example, a self write read type optical disk, is used to irradiate the laser sensitive layer 12 . A spiral projected pattern 16 is locally formed on the laser sensitive layer 12 , such that a gas is discharged from laser incident portion which then expands and deforms. A structure 18 so obtained is used as an original disk.
