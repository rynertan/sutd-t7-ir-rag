# Open mesh fabric.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a dimensionally stable, flexible and open mesh woven fabric wherein the warp elements 1 are arranged in groups 3 spaced apart from each other and wherein the clamping force of the warp elements 1 on the weft elements 2 in group 3 is such that the axial movement of the weft elements 2 occurs only in case of an axial tensile loading of at least 1 of the breaking strength of these weft elements. The warp and weft elements are preferably steel cords. The fabrics can be attached to each other at their longitudinal edges and loaded with ballast weights.
