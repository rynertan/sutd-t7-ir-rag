# A process for the preparation of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide.

## Abstract
In the preparation of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide by the direct oxidation of isobutane, the production of tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, expressed as the quantity of the compound prepared per unit of reactor volume per unit of time, is enhanced by conducting the oxidation in a dense, supercri tical phase reaction mixture at a temperature in excess of the critical temperature of the mixture, at a pressure in excess of the critical pressure of the mixture.
