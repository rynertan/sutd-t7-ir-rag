# Permanent magnet rotor e.g. for generators and method of construction.

## Abstract
A permanent magnet rotor constructed using nonfusion bonding techniques whereby an inner cylinder 10 of magnetizable material is bonded inside a hollow outer cylinder 20 of non magnetizable material. The resulting assembly has cylindrical end pieces 40,42 also of non magnetizable material bonded at each end. Pockets 60 for receiving the rare earth permanent magnets 70 are machined through the outer cylinder and the magnets are mounted in the pockets in contact with the magnetizable material of the inner cylinder 10 . Construction of the rotor is completed by installing thin cylindrical shell 80 over the permanent magnets 70 and the areas of the rotor adjacent thereto.
