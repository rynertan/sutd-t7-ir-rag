# Cam actuated loader for forming machine.

## Abstract
A loader 10 for a forming machine 12 is dis closed as including a horizontally elongated transfer beam 6 supported by a linkage 52 and moved by a dual output cam unit 62 . A first output 64 of the cam unit 62 is connected to an intermediate portion 50 of the beam 46 and a second output 66 thereof is connected to the linkage 52 to cooperatively move the beam 46 vertically and horizontally in a closed path such that workpieces 30 are moved into align ment with a work station 22 of the machine 12 for forming and out of alignment therewith after the form ing is completed. The cam unit 62 has first and second cams 68, 72 that move associated first and second followers 200, 224 to move the first and second out puts 64, 66 which respectively actuate horizontal and vertical movement of the transfer beam 46 . A slide connection 210 connects the first follower 200 with an intermediate portion 50 of the transfer beam 46 , and an actuating link 92 connects the second follower 224 with one end lever 78 of the linkage 52 to actuate the vertical transfer beam movement. A con necting link 88 of the linkage 52 connects the one end lever 78 with another end lever 80 to provide coordinated support of the opposite ends 48 of the transfer beam through roller slide connections 86 that allow the transfer beam 46 to move horizontally under the impetus of the first output 64 of the cam unit 62 .
