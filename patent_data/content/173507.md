## Description
This invention relates to a method for modifying a zeolite composition to increase acidic catalytic activity of the zeolite Zeolite catalysts have become widely used in the processing of petroleum and in the production of various petrochemicals. Acid catalyzed reactions such as cracking, hydrocracking, catalytic dewaxing, alkylation, dealkylation, transalkylation, isomerization, polymerization, addition, disproportionation and conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons may be performed with the aid of these catalysts. Both natural and synthetic zeolites are known to be active for these reactions. The common crystalline zeolite catalysts are the aluminosilicates such as zeolites A, X, Y and mordenite. Structurally, each such material can be described as a robust three dimensional framework of SiO₄ and AlO₄ tetrahedra that are crosslinked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen is 1 2. These structures as well as other crystalline zeolites of catalytic usefulness are porous, and permit access of reactant molecules to the interior of the crystal through windows formed of eight membered rings small pore or of twelve membered rings large pore . The electrovalence of the aluminum that is tetrahedrally contained in the robust framework is balanced by the inclusion of cations in the channels pores of the crystal. An oxide empirical formula that has been used to describe the above class of crystalline zeolites is M₂ For the above common zeolite compositions, wherein x has a value of 2 to 10, it is known that the ion exchange capacity measured in conventional fashion is directly proportional to the amount of the minor constituent in the robust framework, provided that the exchanging cations are not so large as to be excluded by the pores. If the zeolite is exchanged with ammonium ions and calcined to convert it to the hydrogen form, it aquires a large catalytic activity measured by the alpha activity test for cracking n hexane, which test is more fully described below. It is generally recognized that the composition of the robust framework of the synthetic common zeolites, wherein x 2 to 10, may be varied within relatively narrow limits by changing the proportion of reactants, e.g., by changing the concentration of the silica relative to the alumina in the zeolite forming mixture. However, definite limits, for example in the maximum obtainable silica to alumina ratio, are observed. Synthetic faujasites having a silica to alumina ratio of 5.2 to 5.6 can be obtained by changing said relative proportions. However, if the silica proportion is increased above the level which produces the 5.6 ratio, no commensurate increase in the silica to alumina ratio of the crystallized synthetic faujasite is observed. Thus, the silica to alumina ratio of about 5.6 must be considered an upper limit for synthetic faujasite in a preparative process using conventional reagents. Corresponding limits in the silica to alumina ratio of mordenite and erionite via the synthetic pathway are also observed. A class of synthetic high silica content crystalline zeolites wherein x is at least 12, has recently been discovered. In general, such zeolites are made from a forming solution which contains an organic template. Unlike the common synthetic zeolites, these high silica content zeolites appear to have no natural counterpart. Members of this new class of zeolites have many advantageous properties, which properties generally include a high degree of structural stability. They are used or have been proposed for use in various processes, especially catalytic processes. Known materials of this type include ZSM 5 type zeolites. Unlike the common zeolites described above wherein x 2 to 10, the silica to alumina ratio for zeolites of the ZSM 5 type exceeds 12 and generally has an upper limit which appears to be unbounded, i.e. the ratio may be infinitely large. An important characteristic of the crystal structure of this class of zeolites is that it provides constrained access to and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having an effective pore size intermediate between the small pore Linde A and the large pore Linde X, i.e. the pore windows of the structure have about a size such as would be provided by 10 membered rings of oxygen atoms. It is to be understood, of course, that these rings are those formed by the regular disposition of the tetrahedra making up the anionic framework of the crystalline aluminosilicate, the oxygen atoms themselves being bonded to the silicon or aluminum atoms at the centers of the tetrahedra. Thus the ZSM 5 type zeolites referred to herein have an effective pore size such as to freely sorb normal hexane, while providing constrained access to larger molecules. It is sometimes possible to judge from a known crystal structure whether such constrained access exists. For example, if the only pore windows in a crystal are formed by 8 membered rings of oxygen atoms, then access to molecules of larger cross section than normal hexane is excluded and the zeolite is not of the ZSM 5 type. Windows of 10 membered rings are preferred, although in some instances excessive puckering of the rings or pore blockage may render these zeolites ineffective. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access to molecules larger than normal paraffins, a simple determination of the Constraint Index , or C.I., described in U.S. 4,016,218 may be made. The ZSM 5 type zeolites, which are suitable for use in present method, have a constraint index between 1 and 12. It is however to be appreciated that, for ZSM 5 type zeolites of very high silica to alumina ratio, such as 1600 1 and above, Constraint Index cannot be measured reliably because of the low activity of the zeolite. In such cases reliance on X ray pattern is useful. Many such zeolites, after activation by the present method become sufficiently active to make an evaluation of Constraint Index feasible. It is an object of this invention to provide a simple method for increasing the acid catalytic activity of a high silica content zeolite of the ZSM 5 type. Accordingly, the invention resides in a method of modifying a zeolite composition comprising a physical mixture of a zeolite having a silica to alumine ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index of 1 to 12 and a solid source of aluminum, which method comprises contacting said mixture with an aqueous solution containing an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound selected from an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a weak acid having a dissociation constant less than 10 In the method of the present invention, the presence of the alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a strong mineral acid serves to promote the activation effect of the remainder of the treating solution, providing higher levels of activation, and or shorter treating time, and or reduced treatment temperature than is obtained in its absence. The mechanism of the promotion effect is not understood. The modification of the zeolite is preferably effected by treatment with a continuous phase of liquid water having a pH of at least 7. The treatment advantageously is conducted in the absence of organic amines. Although the treatment may be conducted over the broad temperature range of 1 C to 370 C, i.e. below the critical temperature of water, under the preferred conditions recited below an extensive increase in acid catalytic activity may be achieved at or below the normal boiling point of water. The above treatment may be used to increase the acid catalytic activity of a virgin ZSM 5 type zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio of about 70 1 to as high as about 26000 1, as well as of ZSM 5 type catalysts which have become deactivated in use. The term acid catalytic activity as used herein refers to the effectiveness of the zeolite, when in suitable form, for catalyzing reactions known to be promoted by so called acid catalysts. Catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, skelatal isomerization, catalytic dewaxing, and various aromatic hydrocarbon reactions such as alkylation, dealkylation, isomerization and disproportionation, are hydrocarbon conversion reactions which fall in the category of acid catalyzed reactions. Other reactions, such as alcohol dehydration, are also in this class. As is known in the art, the acid catalytic activity of a zeolite may be measured by its alpha value , which is the ratio of the rate constant of a test sample for cracking normal hexane to the rate constant of a standard reference catalyst. Thus, an alpha value 1 means that the test sample and the reference standard have about the same activity. The alpha test is described in U.S. Patent 3,354,078 and in The Journal of Catalysis, Vol. IV, pp. 522 529 August 1965 . Measurement of the alpha value is useful to assess the extent of catalyst activity before treatment, and also the degree of activation achieved with any sample treated by the method of this invention. For this purpose, the zeolite is converted to the hydrogen form before evaluation. However, other conversions also may be used to assess catalytic activity, as illustrated by Example 4 for toluene disproportionation. The high silica content zeolite treated by the present method is of the ZSM 5 type, exemplified by ZSM 5 US 3,702,886 , ZSM 11 US 3,709,979 , ZSM 12 US 3,832,449 , ZSM 23 US 4,076,842 , ZSM 35 US 4,016,245 , ZSM 38 US 4,046,859 and ZSM 48 EP B 15132 , with ZSM 5 being preferred. The treatment is conducted with a physical mixture of the zeolite and a solid source of aluminum. The solid source of aluminum, which is believed to furnish the aluminum for insertion into the robust framework of the zeolite, may be in the form of discrete beads of alumina, or it may be present as the alumina binder in an extrudate formed from a mixture of the zeolite and alpha alumina monohydrate, for example. The proportions of the zeolite and solid source of aluminum are not believed to be critical, and the physical mixture may contain 1 wt to 99 wt , preferably 15 wt to 85 wt of the solid source of aluminum. It has been observed that an intimate mixture, such as provided by an extrudate, activates more readily compared with a less intimate mixture such as that provided by discrete alumina beads, but both are effective. Although the preferred solid source of aluminum is alumina, other solids comprising alumina may be used. Such solids include, either with or without prior treatment, silica alumina gels, clays such as attapulgite, montmorillonite, alumina hydrosols, and Dixie and Mac Namee clays. The activation method is exceedingly simple. The physical mixture of ZSM 5 type zeolite and solid source of aluminum is treated with liquid water at a temperature below its critical temperature, i.e. below about 370 C, in the presence of an activator in the form of an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound and a activation promoter in the form of an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a strong mineral acid for a time effective to induce increased activity. The amount of liquid water required is at least that amount sufficient to fill the pores of the physical mixture to be treated. However, for maximum effectiveness, and for best repeatability and control of the activation process, it is preferred to use sufficient excess liquid water so that a portion or all of the physical mixture is submerged in liquid water, i.e. it is preferred to conduct the activation in a continuous phase of liquid water. Although the method may be practised over the whole range of temperature at which water remains liquid, i.e. from about 1 C to 370 C, an outstanding feature is that activation is so facile that the normal boiling point of water often need not be exceeded. Substantial activation may even be observed at room temperature. However, a particularly preferred embodiment is to conduct the activation under reflux at about the normal boiling point of water, under which conditions the activity of a ZSM 5 sample, in as little as 2 hours, may be increased about 20 thousand fold from a hexane cracking activity of about 0.02 to 450. As used herein, the term alkali or alkaline earth metal compound means an alkali or alkaline earth metal compound selected from an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a weak acid having a dissociation constant less than about 10 Particularly preferred sources of alkali metal compound are sodium or potassium hydroxide, the sodium or potassium salts of acetic, carbonic and phosphoric acid, and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred alkaline earth metal compounds are compounds of calcium, strontium and barium. The amount of alkali or alkaline earth metal compound to be used may vary depending on the compound, but in general the amount used is effective in the absence of promoter to increase by a substantial amount, such as 20 , the acid catalytic activity over that observed by the same treatment conducted with the same physical mixture in the absence of said compound. Most preferably, the activator is sodium or potassium hydroxide at a concentration in said solution of 0.001 to 1 molar. The amount of activation promoter used also may vary widely, typically ranging from 0.1 mol to 20 mols of promoter per mol of alkali or alkaline earth metal compound, and preferably from 0.2 to 10 mols. Generally, sufficient promoter is used to increase by at least 10 the acid catalytic activity over that observed with the alkali or alkaline earth metal compound alone, i.e. in the absence of promoter, when evaluated under indentical conditions. Where the treatment is effected in the presence of a continuous liquid water phase as described above, the pH of the liquid phase including dissolved sources of the alkali or alkaline earth metal compound and promoter is preferably adjusted to a pH of at least about 7, and preferably to a pH of 7 to 12. Thus, it has been observed that optimal activation is fostered by an optimal concentration of hydroxyl ion. While this is not completely understood, it is believed that exposure of the zeolite composition to excessive hydroxyl ion concentration under a given set of conditions leads to an excessive, counterproductive loss of crystallinity. The treatment conditions may vary broadly within a temperature of 1 C up to 370 C, for a time less than about 1 hour to 100 hours. A preferred temperature range is from 10 C to 200 C, with the most preferred temperature range being 20 C to 100 C. For any of these temperature ranges, the preferred treatment time is from 1 hour to 24 hours. The present treatment is also most preferably conducted in the absence of organic nitrogen compounds. The zeolites that are treated by the present method may be incorporated in another material usually referred to as a matrix or binder. Such matrix materials include synthetic or naturally occuring substances as well as inorganic materials such as clay, silica and or metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolites employed herein may be composited with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica alumina and silica magnesia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of zeolite component and inorganic oxide gel matrix on an anhydrous basis may vary widely with the zeolite content ranging from between 5 to 99 percent by weight and more usually in the range of 10 to 80 percent by weight of the dry composite. The present method is believed to effect insertion of aluminum into the robust framework of the zeolite, without substantial change of the crystal structure. The increased ion exchange capacity of the product may be measured by ordinary ion exchange techniques, or by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia. The ammonia desorption TGA technique is described in a publication by G. T. Kerr in Thermochemica Acta, The products produced by the present method are at least partially in the alkali metal form. They may be converted to the hydrogen or to any other form suitable for a particular application by methods known in the art. The crystalline materials prepared by the present method are useful as ion exchangers and as catalyst components for a variety of conversion processes. Such processes include, as non limiting examples, cracking hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 300 C to 700 C, a pressure of from 10 to 3039 kPa 0.1 to 30 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.1 to 20 dehydrogenating hydrocarbon compounds with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 300 C to 700 C, a pressure of from 10 to 1013 kPa 0.1 to 10 atmospheres and a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.1 to 20 converting paraffins to aromatics with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 100 C to 700 C, a pressure of from 10 to 6078 kPa 0.1 atmosphere to 60 atomospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.5 to 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 0 to 20 converting olefins to aromatics, e.g. benzene, toluene and zylenes, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 100 C to 700 C, a pressure of from 10 to 6078 kPa 0.1 to 60 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.5 to 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 0 to 20 converting alcohols, e.g. methanol, or ethers, e.g. dimethylether, or mixtures thereof to hydrocarbons including aromatics with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 275 C to 600 C, a pressure of from 51 tp 5065 kPa 0.5 to 50 atmospheres and a liquid hourly space velocity of from 0.5 to 100 isomerizing xylene feedstock components with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 230 C to 510 C, a pressure of from 304 to 3546 kPa 3 to 35 atomospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.1 to 200 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 0 to 100 disproportionating toluene with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 200 C to 760 C, a pressure of from 101 to 6078 kPa 1 to 60 atmoshperes and a weight hourly space velocity of from 0.08 to 20 alkylating aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene and alkylbenzenes, in the presence of an alkylating agent, e.g. olefins, formaldehyde, alkyl halides and alcohols, with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 340 C to 500 C, a pressure of from 101 to 20260 kPa 1 to 200 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 2 to 2000 and an aromatic hydrocarbon alkylating agent mole ratio of from 1 1 to 20 1 and transalkylating aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbons with reaction conditions including a temperature of from 340 C to 500 C, a pressure of from 101 to 20260 kPa 1 to 200 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity of from 10 to 1000 and an aromatic hydrocarbon polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbon mole ratio of from 1 1 to 16 1. This invention will now be illustrated by the following examples in which all parts and proportions recited are by weight unless explicitely stated to be otherwise. An extrudate consisting of 65 high silica ZSM 5 SiO₂ Al₂O₃ 26,000 and 35 Al₂O₃ was refluxed for 20 hours with aqueous Na₂CO₃ 0.5 M and NaNO₃ 0.6 M solution. The extrudate was then washed, and converted into the ammonium form by ion exchange with 1N NH₄NO₃. The extrudate was then calcined at 538 C and tested for n hexane cracking activity. The starting material had an alpha value of 1 whereas the treated material had an alpha value of 1451. The ion exchange capacity of the ammonium form of the extrudate, both before and after treatment, was determined by the ammonia desorption TGA thermogravimetric analysis technique. The results, computed on final weight ash , were as follows before treatment 0.08 meq g after treatment 0.6077 meq g. An extrudate consisting of 65 ZSM 5 SiO₂ Al₂O₃ 70 and 35 Al₂O₃ was steamed at 538 C 1000 F for 16 hours. The steamed catalyst was refluxed for 20 hours with aqueous Na₂CO₃ 0.5 M and NaNO₃ 0.6 M solution. The extrudates were then washed, and converted into ammonium form by exchange with 1N NH₄NO₃. The extrudates were then calcined at 538 C and tested for n hexane cracking activity. The steam deactivated material had an alpha value of 33, whereas the the treated material had an alpha value of 1215. The activated catalyst of Example 2 was used to disproportionate toluene to benzene and xylenes by passing toluene vapor over the catalyst at various temperatures with pressure 150 psig 1135 kPa , WHSV 4.7 and H₂ HC mole ratio 2.8. Figure 1 shows the percent toluene conversion at various temperatures. Results are compared to the steamed deactivated ZSM 5 and conventional ZSM 5 SiO₂ Al₂O₃ 70 . For 43 toluene conversion, the activated catalyst was run at 430 C, the conventional ZSM 5 at 475 C. The steamed deactivated catalyst ran at 550 C showed only 30 conversion. A sample of the same batch of extrudate as used in Example 1 was refluxed for 20 hours with aqueous Na₂CO₃ 0.5 M solution. The extrudate was then washed, and converted into the ammonium form by exchange with 1N NH₄NO₃. The extrudate was then calcined at 538 C and tested for n hexane cracking activity. The treated material was evaluated for hexane cracking activity and was found to have an alpha value of 1188.
