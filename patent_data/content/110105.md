# Systems for reading magnetic recordings.

## Abstract
The circuit shown is for use in a system for detecting information stored upon a flexible magnetic media that in cludes a magnetic transducer for producing an analog sig nal representing stored binary data, comparator means for detecting positive and negative peaks of the analog signal, and voltage threshold means for providing a reference threshold voltage to the comparator which is a precise percentage of the voltage peaks of the analog signal. The circuit shown generates an improved magnetic recording detection pointer and comprises a pulse width discriminator arrangement which is used to monitor the time per peak during which the analog signal exceeds the detection threshold as an indication of marginal data which can be used in conjunction with an error correction system to ex tend the overall system correction capability. The circuit comprises an exclusive NOR to which the positive and negative peak value signals P COMP and N COMP are fed and which controls the conductivity of a normally ON transistor 14. When the transistor 14 is held OFF the capacitor 18 is charged and provides a rising signal to the comparator 21. The comparator 21 receives a ref erence signal from node 22 in a series circuit receiving a threshold voltage V
