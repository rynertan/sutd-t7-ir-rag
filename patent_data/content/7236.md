# High level radioactive waste immobilised in a mineral assemblage and process for immobilising high level radioactive waste.

## Abstract
A mineral assemblage containing immobilised high level radioactive waste MLW , said assemblage comprising cryst als belonging to, or having crystal structures closely related to crystals belonging to, mineral classes which are resistant to leaching and alteration in appropriate geologic environments and including crystals belonging to he titanate classes of minerals, and said assemblage having elements of said HLW incorporated in solid solution within the crystals thereof. The assemblage is made by mixing the HLW and selected oxides including TiOâ‚‚ and thus heating and cooling to crystal lise the mixture. The assemblage preferably contains crystals of or struc turally related to at least three of the mineral classes perovs kite, zirconolite, hollandite type mineral, barium felspar, leuc ite, kalsilite, and nepheline or at least two of the mineral classes perovskite, zirconolite and hollandite type mineral.
