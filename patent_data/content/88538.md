## Description
The present invention relates generally toimproved apparatus for recording and or readingdata in a high density data storage system, andmore particularly to improved apparatus for providingreliable and accurate positioning controlduring the recording and reading of data in a highdensity optical storage system. In recent years considerable effort has beenexpended to develop improved methods andapparatus for optically recording and reading on asuitable medium because of the unusually highrecording density potential offered by opticalrecording. Examples of various known methodsand approaches are revealed in the followingreferences French Patent Application 2,444,314 discloses avideo disc system wherein a servo system drivesa mirror galvanometer to maintain a readingbeam on a track on a video disc. In French Patent2,444,134 the mirror galvanometer is supportedon a carriage which is moved with constant radialvelocity relative to the disc. Whenever thecarriage has moved so far that the mirror galvanometerhas reached an extremity of its trackingrange the mirror galvanometer is releasedand allowed to swing top an opposite extremity ofits tracking range once again to lock into the trackto provide a rapid sweep throughout the contentsof a video disc. The present application seeks toprovide improvement thereover by providing atrack following servomechanism for use at muchhigher track densities on an optical data storagedisc where the carriage supportive of the mirrorgalvanometer is, during locking onto a singletrack, moved and controlled in its radial positionsuch that the mirror galvanometer is maintainednear its center or undeflected position duringtrack following, thereby providing the galvanometermirror with a much greater effectivedynamic range despite the occurrence of relativelywide track position variations such ascaused by track eccentricity during track following. DE A 2 941 792 discloses optical apparatusfor reading a disc record including beam positioningapparatus having an angularly adjustablebeam deflector device for providing fine radialpositioning in order to keep the beam following atrack once selected, and also a coarse radialpositioning system for moving between tracks byradially moving the beam deflector device. Thecoarse positioning system includes apotentiometer which provides an output signalindicative of the radial position of the beamdeflection device. When the beam is to be movedto a new track, the output of the potentiometer iscompared with a signal indicative of the radialposition of the new track to produce a signalwhich is applied to the coarse positioning systemto move the beam deflector device to the newtrack. In order to compensate for errors in theoutput signal of the potentiometer, a correctionsignal representative of the average deflection ofthe beam deflection device is derived integrationbeing used for averaging which is added to theoutput signal of the potentiometer. Since theneed to employ the beam deflection device in thismanner during coarse positioning has an adverseeffect on the searching speed, DE A 2 941 792provides for storing the correction signal for usein a like manner during other seek operationsbased on the assumption that there exists a fairlyaccurate relationship between tracks and theirradial positions on the record carrier. Although DE A 2 941 792 provides a solutionfor correcting coarse positioning errors, it stillrequires that the adjustable beam deflector deviceitself be able to compensate for variations duringtrack following, such as caused by track eccentricities.Thus, if relatively large track eccentricitiesare present e.g. 35 track is in opticaldisc data stores of the kind with which the presentinvention is concerned the beam deflector deviceis burdened with having to compensate for theselarge eccentricities. The present invention solvesthis problem by using a derived mirror deflectionangle signal to drive our coarse positioner duringthe track following operation such that the mirroris maintained near its center or undeflected positionas the selected track is followed despite thepresence of relatively large track eccentricities. US A 3 854 015 discloses apparatus for reading a disc shapedrecord carrier in which information is recorded in the formof a spiral track. The information is optically read usinga track following system having two components radialdisplacement at a speed corresponding to the pitch of thespiral information track and rapid radial displacement whichmay be used to slow the rate at which information is read orcompensate for pivot mounting eccentricities. JP A 80 125 542 discloses apparatus which can record orretrieve information using an optical disc as a storagemedium. The reading head has two driving systems. A fastcoarse positioning system for track selection on the basis ofan address signal and a slower track following system formaintaining the reading head on the required track. Thetrack following circuit uses a control voltage suppliedthrough a low pass filter. No provision is made forreducing deviation arising from track eccentricity. JP A 81 187 869 discloses optical memory apparatus which canretrieve information stored on an optical disc using a laserbeam for reading. The apparatus uses a coarse movementwhich can traverse the whole radius of the disc and a finemovement to provide accurate track following. The motionsof the two movements are interlocked so that the reading headcan rapidly and accurately access a preselected track. Whenaccessing a track initially the head can jump tracks if it ispositioned incorrectly. The control characteristics of thefine movement are altered after the access stage is completeto provide accurate tracking during reading. The present invention relates to an optical disc data storewherein a reading light beam is positionable to interact witha selectable one out of a plurality of tracks on an opticaldisc for the retrieval of data therefrom, said disc datastore having beam positioning apparatus comprising adeflector which when deflected moves said reading beamradially on said disc relative to said track control meansresponsive to a track following signal derived from saidreading beam for controlling said deflector for providingtrack following along a selected track a deflection detectorcoupled to said deflector and operable to provide an outputindicative of the deflection thereof and a linear positioningsystem operable to radially move said deflector withrespect to said disc, while said control means is operativein conjunction with said deflector to provide trackfollowing, said output of said detector is coupled to saidlinear positioning system, and said linear positioning systemforms a portion of a coarse positioning servomechanismoperable, in the absence of operation of said track followingservomechanism, to receive an input representative of thedifference between the actual radial position of saidactuator on said disc, and the desired radial position onsaid disc as an error input, and to respond thereto by movingsaid deflector to bring said reading beam into radialproximity to a desired track on said disc, said actuatorpositioning said deflector, when said linear positioningsystem is operative, under the control of said beamdisplacement detector and, when said coarse positioningservomechanism is operative, said actuator positions thedeflector under the control of said error input,characterized in that said linear positioning system isadapted to cause said deflector to be radially moved suchthat said deflector resides near its undeflected positionduring track following operation despite the presence ofrelatively large track eccentricities, said radial movementof said deflector occurring concurrently with deflection ofthe deflector. As is well recognized, it is of crucial importancein an optical memory system that reliable andaccurate positioning control be provided duringthe recording and reproducing operations. Thisrequirement is a particularly severe one in anoptical memory system because of the very highdata recording density typically employed, ascompared, for example, to magnetic memory discsystems which store data at a relatively muchlower density. It is accordingly the broad object of the present invention to provide a significantlyimproved positioning control during therecording and or reading of data in a high densitystorage system, such as an optical data storagesystem.

Fig. 12 is a preferred embodiment of the arrivaldetector shown in Fig. 11. Like numerals and characters designate likeelements throughout the figures of the drawings. Reference is initially directed to Fig. 1, whichgenerally illustrates the basic portions of theembodiment of an optical recording and readingsystem disclosed in the aforementionedcommonly assigned copending patent applications.The data to be recorded is first applied torecording circuitry 10 which encodes the applieddata using, for example, a conventional encodingformat of the type employed for magneticrecording, such as non retun to zero, return to zero,etc. Conventional error checking may alsobe provided for the encoded signal. The encoded data 10a from the recording circuitry10 is applied to a laser optical system 12.The laser optical system 12 generates three laserbeams 12a, 12b and 12c which are focused atspaced locations along the center line of the sameselected track of a preformatted optical disk 15supported on a precision spindle 16 for rotationby a motor 18. The optical disk 15 may, forexample, be a trilayer disk of the type disclosed inthe aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,222,071 andin the aforementioned article by Bell, et al. Eachlaser beam may, for example, be focused to a onemicron spot size on the disk 15. Laser beam 12a is a writing beam which ismodulated by the encoded data so as to formoptically detectable changes in a selected track ofthe optical disk 15 representative of the encodeddata. It is to be understood that the opticallydetectable changes produced in the disk by thewrite laser beam 12a need not be physicalchanges, such as pits or physical holes. The onlyrequirement is that optically detectable changesbe produced in selected areas of the disk inresponse to the write laser beam 12a which arerepresentative of the encoded data 10a. For thepurpose of this description, all of the possibletypes of optically detectable changes that can beproduced will hereinafter be referred to as opticalholes. Laser beams 12b and 12c shown in Fig. 1 arereading beams. As typically illustrated in Fig. 2,the reading beam 12b Is a read after write beamwhich is accordingly focused behind the writingbeam 12a on the center line 17a of a selected track17, while the reading beam 12c is a read before writebeam and is accordingly focused ahead ofthe writing beam 12a. The intensity of the readbeams 12b and 12c are chosen so that they willnot disturb the integrity of previously recordedinformation. The read beams are reflected fromthe disk 15 back to the optical system 12 which, inresponse thermo, derives a plurality of detectionsignals 14a, 14b and 14c which are applied tosignal processing electronics 20. The signal processingelectronics 20 also receives the encodeddata signal 10a from the recording circuitry 10 foruse in checking the accuracy of recorded data, aswill hereinafter be considered. The signal processing electronics 20 uses thedetected signals 14a, 14b and 14c to provide anoutput data signal 20a corresponding to data readfrom the optical disk 15, along with signals 20band 20c respectively identifying the track andsector locations on the disk from whkh the data isread. The signal processing electronics 20 alsoproduces control signals 10b, 21a, 21b, 21c, 21d,21e and 21f. More specifically, control signal 10bis applied to the recording circuitry 10 for synchronizingthe encoding of data with disk rotation control signal 21a is applied to the opticaldisk motor 18 to provide accurate sped controlduring recording and reading control signal 21bis applied to the laser optical system 12 forcontrolling the radial position of the laser beams12a, 12b and 12c for the purpose of selecting adesired track control signal 21c is applied to thelaser optical system 12 for providing precise trackfollowing of the laser beams on the selectedtrack control signal 21d is applied to the laser optical system 12 for providing precise focusingof the laser beams 12a, 12b and 12c and controlsignal 21e is applied to the recording circuitry 10for interrupting recording if the reflected read before writebeam indicates the possibility of anoverwrite recording error because the track aheadcontains previously recorded data and signal 21gis applied to the recording circuitry 10 to interruptrecording if a recording error occurs. Reference is next directed to Fig. 3 whichillustrates a preferred embodiment of the laseroptical system 12 generally shown in Fig. 1. Thevarious components of this laser optical systemare illustrated in block and schematic form in Fig.3 since their implementation can readily be providedby those skilled in the art, as will be evidentfrom the aforementioned references. As shown in Fig. 3, a laser 30 provides a beam30a having a wavelength of, for example, 633nanometers and a power level of, for example, 12mw. This laser beam 30a is applied to a first beamsplitter 32 which splits the beam into a highpower beam 32a and a low power beam 32b. Thelow power beam 32b is applied to a second beamsplitter 34 which further splits the beam 32b toprovide read after write and read before writebeams 12b and 12c, respectively. It is to beunderstood that a separate laser could beemployed for providing one or more of the abovebeams if so desired. The high power bearn 32a in Fig. 3 is applied toa high speed light modulator 36 which modulatesthe beam 32a in response to the encoded data10a. Read beams 12b and 12c pass back to the beamcombiner and splitter 38 via the objective lensassembly 44 and the mirror 40. The beam combinerand splitter 38 directs the reflected beams tooptical detection circuitry 49 which converts thebeams into corresponding read after write andread before write analog electrical signals 14aand 14b which are applied to the signal processingelectronics 20 as shown in Fig. 1. Also, atleast one of the reflected read beams 12a and 12bis applied to a geometric optical focus detector 47which provides a relatively low gain, wide capturerange signal 14c to the signal processing electronics20 which is indicative of the quality offocusing of the beams on the selected track. Next to be considered is the preformattingprovided for the optical disk 15 in Fig. 1. Anexample of a typical preformatting arrangementis illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5. As generally indicated in Fig. 4, the optical disk15 in the preferred embodiment being describedcontains a large plurality of circumferential tracks17, for example, 40,000 tracks spaced twomicrons apart on a 14 inch disk. The disk 15 isalso divided into a plurality of sectors 19. Asindicated in Fig. 4, each track 17 within a sector 19comprises a header 51 and a data recordingportion 52. The data recording portion 52 is theportion into which data is written duringrecording and comprises the greater portion ofthe track length within each sector 19. The header51 of a track 17 is encountered first in each sector19 and is provided on the disk prior to recording.A disk provided with such headers 51 is typicallyreferred to as being preformatted. Fig. 5 illustrates an example of a preformattedheader 51 provided for each track 17 in eachsector 19 of the disk 15 of Fig. 3. Although theoptical holes constituting the header 51 need notbe physically observable, as mentioned previously,it will be assumed for the purposes of thisdescription that physical holed, such as pits, areemployed for the exemplary header shown in Fig.4. It will also be assumed that a pit exhibits arelatively high reflectance to an incident beamwhile other undisturbed disk areas exhibit a relativelylow reflectance. It is to be understood thatan arrangement may also be employed in which aportion of the optical recording is provided usingphysical holes, such as pits, and the remainingrecorded portions are recorded using opticalholes. Before continuing with the description of theheader shown in Fig. 5, reference is directed toFig. 7 which illustates a cross section of a disk 15which may be employed in the system of Fig. 1. Asupporting substrate 90 such as a 0.1 to 0.3 inchthick disk of aluminum is coated with an organicsmoothing layer 92 of, for example, 20 60microns prior to deposition thereon of a highlyreflective opaque layer 94 of aluminum whichmay, for example, have a thickness of 400 800Angstroms. An inorganic dielectric layer 96 suchas a 800 1200 Angstrom layer of silicon dioxidewhich is transparent at the laser frequency isdeposited over the aluminum reflector layer 94.An absorbing layer 98 which is absorptive at thelaser frequency is then deposited over the dielectriclayer 96. This absorbing layer 98 may forexample be a 60 to 300 Angstrom layer of a metalsuch as tellurium. Finally, the absorbing layer 98is overcoated with a protective layer 100, such asa silicon resin having a thickness of, for example,150 to 500 microns. Still with reference to Fig. 7, an anti reflection dark mirror condition for a laser beam incidenton unrecorded portions of the disk 15 is producedby appropriately choosing the thicknesses andoptical characteristics of the layers 94, 96 and 98.Recording on such a disk 15 as illustrated in Fig. 7is then accomplished by employing an appropriatelyfocused, intensity modulated recordinglaser beam such as laser beam 12a in Figs. 1 and2 which records information by forming opticallydetectable changes, such as pits 98a, in theabsorbing layer 98 along a selected track, thespacing and dimensions of these pits 98a beingrepresentative of the recorded data. Informationis read from the disk 15 using an appropriatelyfocused reading laser beam such as laser beams12b and 12c in Figs. 1 and 2 which is chosen to beof insufficient intensity to affect unrecordedregions 98b of the absorbing layer 98 and has afrequency at which these unrecorded regions 100exhibit the previously mentioned anti reflectioncondition. As a result, the reflected reading beam will be intensity modulated by the pits 98a sincethe reading beam will experience a relatively highreflection when the beam is incident on a pit 98a,and a relatively low reflection when the readingbeam is incident on an unwritten region 98b. Itwill be understood that dust particles on theupper surface of the protective layer 100 will befar removed from the focal plane of the opticalsystem that is, they will be out of focus so as tohave a negligible effect on the above describedrecording and reading operations. Reference is now directed back to Fig. 5 for amore detailed consideration of the header 51.Since the header 51 is used in conjunction withthe signal processing electronics 20 in Fig. 1 toprovide for reliable and precise operation of thesystem, it will be helpful to describe the constructionand arrangement of the exemplary header 51shown in Fig. 5 in conjunction with Fig. 6 whichillustrates an implementation of the signal processingelectronics 20 generally shown in Fig. 1.The individual components of Fig. 6 can readilybe implemented by those skilled in the art and arethus shown in block form. Referring to the preformatted heading 51shown in Fig. 5, it will be seen that immediatelyfollowing the left sector boundary 19a is a relativelylarge pit 54 providing a relatively largechange in optical reflectance which is used toprovide synchronized timing for the signal processingelectronics 20. This is accomplished byapplying the detected read after write signal 14ain Fig. 3 to a peak detector 73 via a preamplifier71. The peak detector 73 outputs a narrow pulse73a corresponding to the pit 54 which it recognizesas the largest peak in the playback signal.This narrow output pulse 73a produced by thepeak detector 73 is then applied as a timingreference to conventional timing circuitry 75which generates various timing signals 10b, 21a,75a, 75b, 75c, 75d and 75e for synchronizing theoperation of the system with the disk 15. Thepurposes of these timing signals will becomeevident as the description proceeds. Following pit 54 in Fig. 5 are two pits 56 and 58elongated in a direction parallel to the track 17and disposed on opposite sides of the track centerline 17a in a staggered relationship. These pits 56and 58 are used to provide precise track following.This is accomplished in Fig. 6 by applying theamplified read after write signal provided at theoutput of the preamplifier 71 to up down integratorcircuitry 77. The up down integrator circuitry77 integrates up in response to the detectedsignal obtained when the read after write beamtraverses the portion of the track 17 correspondingto the alongated pit 56, and integrateddown in response to the signal obtained when theread after write beam traverses the portion of thetrack 17 corresponding to the elongated pit 58. Itwill be understood that the difference betweenthese two integrations will be a measure of thepreciseness of track following by the laser beams.The dimensions and locations of the elongatedpits 56 and 58 are chosen in conjunction with thesize of the focused beam so that even very smalldeviations of the beam from the track center line17a can be detected. This difference provided byintegrator circuitry 77 when pits 56 and 58 aretraversed during each sector is accordingly usedto produce the control signal 21c which is appliedto the galvanometer 42 Fig. 3 to provide forprecise following of a selected track by the laserbeams. It will be noted in Fig. 6 that the timing circuitry75 provides timing signals 75a and 75b to the up downintegrator circuitry 77. The timing signal75a is used to delineate the particular timesduring traversal of the header 51 of each sectorfor which up and down integrations should beperformed so as to appropriately correspond withthe locations of the elongated pits 56 and 58. Thetiming signal 75b is provided during each sectorto the up down integrator circuitry 77 to serve asa hold signal to hold until the next sector theresultant integrated value obtained after the read after writebeam has completed traversing thesecond elongated pit 58. Following the elongated pits 56 and 58 in theexemplary header 51 shown in Fig. 5 are aplurality of pits 60 elongated perpendicularly tothe track center line 17a. The locations and dimensionsof the pit 60 are chosen so that the reflectedsignal obtained upon traversing these pits 60 willhave a peak value dependent upon the quality offocusing of the incident beam. This may beachieved, for example, by choosing the diameterof each pit 60 so that it is equal to the diameter ofa property focused beam. Then, if the incidentbeam is larger than the thickness of a pit 60because of improper focusing, the reflected beamwill have reduced power when each pit 60 istraversed, since only a portion of the beam will bereflected. It will also be understood that thespacing between the pits 60 along with the diskrotating speed determine the frequency at whichthe reflected beam is modulated when traversingthe pits 60. Referring again to Fig. 6, it will be understoodthat the read after write beam 14a applied to thepreamplifier 71 during the period that the focusingpits 60 are being traversed contains theresulting focusing information. Accordingly, apeak detector 64, which is enabled by timingsignal 75c during the period that the read after writebeam is traversing the focusing pits 60, isprovided to receive the amplified read after writebeam at the output of the preamplifier 71. Thepeak detector 64 is adapted to respond to themagnitude of the applied signal within a frequencyrange determined by the spacing of thepits 60 to produce a relatively high gain outputsignal 64a which is a measure of the quality offocusing. The output signal 64a from the peak detector 64is applied to a signal adder 66 along with thesignal 14c provided by the optical focus detector47 in Fig. 3. The signal adder 66 appropriatelycombines these two signals 14c and 64a to producethe resulting signal 21d shown in Fig. 1 which is applied to the focusing motor 46 formaintaining precise focusing of the incident laserbeams on the disk. The purpose of providing a signal 21d to thefocusing motor 46 comprised of the signal 14cfrom the geometric optical focus detector 47 andthe signal 64a from the peak detector 64 will nowbe further considered. It will be understood thatthe signal 14c obtained from the geometric opticalfocus detector 47 in Fig.3 provides only a relativelylow gain control of the focusing distance which,while providing a wide capture range, typicallyresults in producing a static or low frequencyoffset error. In accordance with the present invention,as exemplified in Fig. 5, a significantly moreprecise and offset free focus signal 21d is achievedby combining the geometric optical detectorsignal 14c with the peek detector signal 64aderived from the focusing holes 60 which iscapable of providing a relatively high gain. Ofcourse, as also applies to the track following pits 56and 58, the header 51 is repeated a sufficientnumber of times around each circumferential track17 to obtain the desired precise and fast actingcontrol of focusing as well as of track following. Continuing with the description of the header 51shown in Fig. 5, the above described focusing pits60 are followed by pits 72 recorded so asto providean identification of the particular track and sectorbeing traversed by the laser beams. In otherwords, the pits 72 represent a track and sectoraddress and conventional encoding can beemployed for this purpose, such as is used foridentifying tracks and sectors on magnetic disks. As shown in Fig. 6 the amplified read after writesignal at the output of the preamplifier 71 isapplied along with an appropriate enabling timingsignal 75d to a track and sector decoder 78 whichprovides track and sector signals 20a and 20brespectively see also Fig. 1 indicating the trackand sector being traversed by the laser beams. Thetrack signal 20b is also applied to track selectioncircuitry 80 along with a track command signal 80aindicative of a selected track to which it is desiredthat the laser beams be positioned. The trackselection circuitry 80 compares the track indicatedby the track signal 20b with the track requested bythe track command signal 80a and in responsethereto produces the signal 21b which is applied tothe linear motor 48 in Fig. 3 to center the laserbeams over the selected track. Referring to Fig. 4 along with Fig. 5, it will beunderstood that, in the exemplary header 51illustrated, the pits 72 which provide track andsector address identification are the last portion ofthe header 51. As pointed out previously, theresulting disk containing these headers is consideredto be preformatted. Such preformatteddisks will typically be provided to users who willmake use of the preformatted headers in conjunctionwith signal processing electronics 20 such asillustrated in Fig. 6 for recording and reading datain the data recording portion 52 of each track 17 ineach sector 19. The amplified read after write signal provided atthe output of the preamplifier 71 in Fig. 6 is alsoused for reading data from the data recordingportion 51 of each sector 19 Figs. 4 and 5 .Accordingly, the implementation of Fig. 6 includesdata read circuitry 82 to which the output of thepreamplifier 71 is applied for providing a dataoutput signal 20a see also Fig. 1 corresponding tothe recorded digital data. The data read circuitry 82is enabled during the time period that the read after writebeam is traversing the data portion 52 Fig. 4 of each sector 19 by the timing signal 75e.The resulting data output signal 20a read from thedisk 15 is applied to an appropriate utilizationdevice not shown along with the track and sectorsignals 20b and 20c which identify the track andsector from which data is read. The data output signal 20a is also used duringdata recording to check that data is accuratelybeing recorded. For this purpose Fig. 6 includes adata comparator 83 which receives both the dataoutput signal 20a and the encoded data signal 10afrom the recording circuitry 10. The data comparator83 operates to compare the encoded data10a with the corresponding data 20a read from thedisk 15. If the comparator detects an error in thesignals 10a and 20a, then the recording errorinterrupt signal 21f is produced which is applied tothe recording circuitry 10 to interrupt recording. An additional feature of the present inventionresides in the manner in which the read before writebeam 12c Fig. 2 is employed. It will beappreciated that the density of recording madepossible by the present invention is quite high.Thus, the possibility exists that an error in positioningof the laser beams may arise duringrecording which could result in destroying previouslyrecorded data. Such previously recordeddata can be very expensive to replace, if not lostforever if there is no back up. This problem isprevented by the present invention by making useof the read before write beam 12c. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the read before writesignal 14b obtained from the optical detectioncircuitry 49 in Fig. 3 is applied to a preamplifier 91whose output 91a is in turn applied to a datadetector 95 via filter circuitry 93. The filter circuitry93 is provided to prevent noise from interferingwith the operation of the data detector 95. The datadetector 95 is responsive to the presence ofrecorded data to produce an interrupt signal 96awhich is applied to the recording circuitry 10 Fig.1 to halt recording, therein protecting previouslyrecorded data. It is to be understood that the read before writebeam may also be used for otherpurposes, such as to check the quality of the trackprior to recording, or to provide more precise trackfollowing and or focusing control. Having described the optical system embodimentdisclosed in the aforementioned patentapplications, the improvements In optical beampositioning control provided in accordance withthe present invention will now be considered indetail with reference to Figs. 8 10. Fig. 8 is an electrical and schematic diagramillustrating apparatus for providing improved optical beam positioning control in accordancewith the present invention. The optical disk 15, theobjective lens assembly 44, the galvanometer 42and the linear motor 48 shown in Fig. 8 correspondto like numbered elements in Fig. 3. Theremaining portions of Fig. 8 illustrate a preferredimplementation for precisely controlling themovement of the galvanometer 42 and linearmotor 48 which together control the position ofthe objective lens assembly 44 and thus theposition of the laser beams 12a, 12b and 12c relative to the optical disk 15. The movements ofthe galvanometer 42 and the linear motor 48 arecontrolled in the preferred implementation of Fig.8 so as to provide for the functions of trackfollowing and track seeking. The track following function refers to the operationof the system which causes the laser beamsto accurately follow one particular track unlessthe track is changed as a result of a track seekingoperation. It has already been described in connectionwith Figs. 5 and 6 how, a track followingsignal indicative of the positioning of the laserbeams on a track can be obtained. The manner inwhich the preferred implementation of thepresent invention makes advantageous use ofthis track following signal will become evidenthereinafter. The track seeking function refers to the operationsinvolved in changing the position of thelaser beams from a current track to anotherselected track In the preferred implementation ofFig. 8, track seeking is categorized as a long seekor a short seek. A short seek provides for arelatively small track change of, for example, 50tracks or less which can be provided, for example,in an average time of 200 400 microseconds anda maximum time of less than 1.5 milliseconds. Along seek provides for large track changes which,on a 40,000 track disk, can be many thousands oftracks. The specific manner in which the abovedescribed track following and track seeking functionsare advantageously achieved in the preferredimplementation of Fig. 8 will now beconsidered in detail. The structure of Fig. 8 isbased on the provision of a plurality of interactiveservo loops which provide for unusually accurateand reliable control of the galvanometer 42 andthe linear motor 48 during track seeking andtrack following operations. In order to simplify the description of Fig. 8 andpermit its features and advantages to be clearlyunderstood, the above desired functions track following,long seeking, short seeking will beseparately considered with reference to Figs. 9,10and 11, respectively. Each of the components illustrated in Fig. 8 11are readily providable by those skilled in the artand are thus not provided in greater detail. Also,in order to make Figs. 8 11 easier to understand,the switching occurring between these three functionsare indicated as being performed usingsingle pole, double throw mechanical switches for example, switches 122 and 128 in Figs. 8 and9 which switch in response to one or morelabelled signals which are shown applied to themovable arm of the switch. The contacts of theseswitches are also labelled to indicate the functionof functions to which each corresponds. The label TF indicates track following, the label SS indicates short seeking, and the label LS indicateslong seeking. Those skilled in the art will beable to readily employ appropriate electronicswitching circuitry to perform the switching indicatedby these switches. Also not in Figs. 8 11 that each of the inputs toan analog summer such as summers 116 and138 is provided with a or to indicatewhether the input is being provided in an additiveor subtractive polarity relative to the other inputsto the summer. The track following function will be consideredfirst With reference to Fig. 9 which shows onlythose portions of Fig. 8 which are pertinent to thisfunction. As shown in Fig. 9, the galvanometer 42is driven by a galvanometer amplifier 110 forcontrolling the galvanometer mirror 40 Fig. 3 .The basic servo loop involved in the track followingfunction illustrated in Fig. 9 is provided usingthe track following signal 21c derived by thesignal processing electronics 20. The derivation ofthis signal has been described previously in connectionwith Fig. 6. It will be remenbered that thistrack following signal is a measure of the precisenessof track following by the laser beams and isaccordingly applied as an error signal to thegalvanometer amplifier 110 via a switch 114 which is in the position shown in Fig. 9 duringtrack following and an analog summer 116 formaintaining the laser beams on a particular track.In the preferred embodiment, the spacing of thetracks on the disk are chosen in conjunction withthe dimensions of the track following pits 56 and58 in Fig. 5 so that the laser beams will never hangup between tracks, but will always be following atrack. The address of the particular track beingfollowed can thus be obtained during trackfollowing at the output of the track and sectordecoder 78 in Fig. 6, as described previously. As shown in Fig. 9, the galvenometer 42includes an angle detector 118 which provides anangle signal 118a representative of the currentangular position of the galvanometer mirror 40 Fig. 3 . A suitable angle detector is described, forexample, in the article An Infra Red Based BeamScanner Position Sensor P. M. Trethewey,Region 6 IEEE Student Paper Competition. Wescon 81,Hilton Hotel, San Francisco, California,SS 4. The angle detector signal 118a is employedin two ways in Fig. 9 during track followingoperations. First, the angle signal 118a is appliedto a spring amplifier 120 having appropriatespring compensation characteristics whose output120a is in turn fed back to the galvanometeramplifier 110 via the summer 116 for providingspring compensation feedback for the galvanometermirror. Second, the angle signal 118a is applied, viaswitch 122 which is in the position shown in Fig.9 during track following , analog summer 124,switch 127 which is also in the position shownduring track following , to a relatively high gainlinear motor amplifier 128. In response to theangle signal 118a, the amplifier 128 drives thelinear motor 48 also see Fig. 3 in a manner suchthat the galvanometer 42 which is mechanicallycoupled to the objective lens assembly 44 in Fig.3 is moved in a transverse direction relative tothe track being followed so as to reduce thedeflection required to be provided by the galvanometermirror 40 from the center or undeflectedposition in order to maintain accuratetrack following. In other words, during trackfollowing, the movement of the linear motor 48 inresponse to the detected mirror angle signal 118aacts to maintain the galvanometer mirror near itscenter or undeflected position despite the presenceof relatively large variations in track eccentricity.This achieves the advantageous result ofproviding the galvanometer mirror with a muchgreater effective dynamic range than wouldotherwise be possible, thereby permitting successfuloperation over relatively wide track positionvariations beyond that which the mirrorwould be capable on its own. The importance ofthis capability can be appreciated by realizing thaton a disk in which the tracks are two micronsapart, disk run out due to spindle eccentricitiestypically produce track position variations duringtrack following amounting to as much as 35tracks. In order to provide even further stability andreliability during track following, the speed of thelinear motor 48 is fed back to the galvanometeramplifier 110 as well as to the linear motoramplifier 128. This is accomplished using atachometer 130 with the linear motor 48 whoseoutput is amplified by a tachometer amplifier 132for producing a velocity signal 132a which isapplied to the linear motor amplifier 128 via thesummer 124, and is applied to the galvanometeramplifier 110 via a buffer amplifier 134, a differentiator136 and summers 138 and 116. Theadvantage of providing the differentiator 136 isthat it permits rapid velocity changes to be anticipatedby the galvanometer amplifier 110, therebyresulting in greater overall loop stability. The short seek function is illustrated in Fig. 10and will be seen to comprise the same componentsas the track following function illustratedin Fig. 9 with the addition of those componentspertinent to the short seek function. Theseadditional components are a waveform generator140, a switch 142, an analog summer 144, and anon track detector 146. Note also that switches 114,127 and 142 are shown in their short seek positions.It will be understood that a short seekfunction is one which provides for movement ofthe laser beams from their current track to apredetermined track which is not greater than aspecified number of tracks away from the currenttrack. In the preferred embodiment being considered,the maximum number of tracks that thelaser beams can be moved by a short seekoperation is, for example, 50 tracks. If the beamsmust be moved a greater number of tracks, then along seek is used which will be described hereinafter. As illustrated in Fig. 10, a short seek operationis initiated by the application of a short seekcommand to a short seek waveform generator140. This short seek command is provided by thetrack selection circuit 80 Fig. 6 whenever a newlyselected track is within 50 tracks of the currenttrack. The short seek command contains informationas to the direction and number of trackswhich it is desired that the laser beams be moved.When a short seek command is received by theshort seek waveform generator 140, it produces ashort seek signal SS having a duration determinedby the number of tracks to be moved thatis, a duration which is substantially equal to theexpected time required for moving to the numberof tracks called for by the short seek command.This short seek command SS serves a number ofpurposes 1 to place switch 142 in its Short seekSS position and thereby connect the output of theshort seek waveform generator 140 to the galvanometeramplifier via summers 144, 138 and116, 2 to place switch 114 in its short seek SSposition so as to open the track following loop bydisconnecting the track following signal from thegalvanometer amplifier, and 3 to enable the on trackdetector 145 to monitor the track followingsignal so as to open switch 127 when an off trackcondition is present as during a short seek ,thereby preventing movement of the linear motor48 during the short seek operation. The above described effects produced by theshort seek signal SS permit the output 140aprovided by the waveform generator 140 to beapplied to the galvanometer amplifier 110 toexclusively control the galvanometer mirror andthus the position of the laser beams during ashort seek operation without interference fromthe track following signal since switch 114 will beopen or from the linear motor 48 since switch127 will be open , thereby permitting accuratecontrol of laser beam movement in accordancewith the output 140a provided by the short seekwaveform generator 140. In the preferredembodiment, the output 140a provided by theshort seek waveform generator 140 is chosen tobe a doublet that is, a pulse of one polarityfollowed by a pulse of opposite polarity. Duringthe first pulse, the galvanometer 42 acceleratesand during the second pulse it decelerates. It hasbeen found that the durations and amplitudes ofthese opposite polarity pulses can be chosenbased on the mechanical characteristics of thesystem and the number of tracks to be moved,whereby the galvanometer 42 will rapidly andaccurately move the galvanometer mirror so thatthe laser beams are moved the requested numberof tracks. When the laser beams arrive in the immediate vicinity of the desired track, the shortseek signal SS ends since, as pointed out above,its duration is chosen to be substantially equal tothe time required for the laser beams to be movedthe requested number of tracks in response to thewaveform generator output 140a. When the short seek signal SS ends, switches114 and 142 return to their track following positions.Also, switch 127 returns to its closed positionwhen the on track detector 145 indicates thatthe laser beams are properly on a track, therebyreconnecting the angle detector 118 to the linearmotor amplifier 128. The on track detector 145then returns to its disabled state until the nextshort seek operation. As mentioned previously, the track followingoperations are chosen in conjunction with thetrack spacing so that the laser beams will nothang up between tracks, but will always come torest on a track. If after the above described shortseek operation, the track address provided by thetrack and sector decoder 78 in Fig. 6 indicates thatthe track on which the laser beams came to rest isnot the one requested by the short seek operation,another short seek operation is initiated,and so on until the laser beams come to rest onthe correct track. It has been found that no morethan two short seeks are normally required toposition the laser beams on the correct track andnormally only one short seek is required when thelaser beams are to be moved less than 20 tracks. The operation of the long seek function isillustrated in Fig. 11 which shows those componentsof Fig. 8 pertinent to this function. A longseek is initiated by a long seek command containingdata which is applied to a long seek controlcircuit 150. The track selection signal 21b providedby the track selection circuit 80 Fig. 6 is along seek command whenever a newly selectedtrack is greater than 50 tracks away from thecurrent track. The long seek control circuit 150responds to the applied long seek command toproduce a long seek signal LS which serves anumber of purposes 1 to place switches 114and 142 in their long seek LS positions so as tothereby open the track following loop and disconnectthe short seek waveform generator 140 Fig.10 , 2 to place switch 122 in its long seekposition so as to disconnect the angle detectorsignal 118a from the linear motor amplifier 148and instead connect a long seek waveformgenerator 162 thereto via summer 124, and 3 toplace switch 154 in its long seek position so as toclose a feedback loop which causes the detectedmirror angle signal provided by the angle detector118 to be applied to the galvanometer amplifier42 via a cage amplifier 155 and summers 114,138 and 116 so as to cause the galvanometermirror to be driven to its zero angle position inwhich it remains during the long seek operation this in effect cages the galvanometer mirror atits zero angle position so as to prevent it frominterfering with the long seek operation which isperformed using the linear motor 48, and 4 thelong seek signal LS is also applied to the linearmotor amplifier 128 and tachometer amplifier 132for changing the gain of these amplifiers to valuesbetter suited to the long seek operation, the gainof the linear motor amplifier 128 being decreased,while the gain of the tachometer amplifier 132 isincreased. The long seek command applied to the longseek control circuit 150 in Fig. 11 contains datarepresentative of a new track to which the laserbeams are to be moved. In response to this longseek command, the long seek control circuit 150produces an output signal 150a to an analogsummer 156 having a magnitude indicative of thenew position to which the linear motor 48 shouldbe moved in order to correspond to the new track.The summer 156 also receives a signal 160aindicative of the position of the linear motor 130derived from a linear variable differential transformer LVDT 158 coupled to the linear motor 48,the LVDT signal being applied to the summer 156via an LVDT amplifier 160. The resulting output 156a of the summer 156 inFig. 11 is representative of the difference betweenthe current position indicated by LVDT 158 andthe desired position indicated by the long seekcommand. The summer output 156a is applied toa long seek waveform generator 162. The longseek waveform generator 162 responds to thesummer output 156a to generate an output signal162a having a waveform chosen so that, whenapplied to the linear motor 48 via switch 152,summers 124 and 126, switch 127 and the linearmotor amplifier 148 , the linear motor 48 israpidly and smoothly moved to a position correspondingto the desired selected track The arrivalof the linear motor 48 at the selected positionduring a long seek operation in Fig. 11 is determinedusing an arrival detector 164 Which isresponsive to the outputs of the LVDT amplifier160, the tachometer amplifier 132 and thesummer 156 for providing an output signal 164aindicative of the completion of the long seekoperation. Fig. 12 illustrates a preferred implementation ofthe arrival detector 164 in Fig. 11. As indicated inFig. 12 the tachometer amplifier output signal132a is applied to a comparator 170 which comparesthe linear motor velocity represented by thesignal 132a with a maximum velocity referencesignal. When the linear motor velocity is belowthe maximum velocity represented by the maximumvelocity reference signal, the comparator170 produces a true or 1 output signal 170awhich is applied to an AND gate 176. Still with reference to Fig. 12, the summeroutput 156a in Fig. 11, which represents thedifference between the current and desired positionsof the linear motor, is applied to a comparator174 which compares this difference signal156a with a maximum difference reference signal.When the difference signal 156a is below themaximum difference value represented by themaximum difference reference signal, the comparator 174 produces a true or 1 outputsignal 174a which is also applied to the AND gate176. It will accordingly be understood that the resultingoutput 164a from the AND gate 176 in Fig. 12will thus be true or 1 only when both thelinear motor velocity and the difference betweencurrent and desired motor positions are belowpredetermined maximum values, thereby providinga highly stable and reliable detection of thearrival of the linear motor at the position called forby the long seek command Fig. 11 . Returning now to Fig. 11, the arrival detectoroutput signal 164a is applied to the long seekcontrol circuit 150 which, in response thereto,turns off the long seek signal LS when the arrivaldetector 164 indicates that the linear motor 48 hasarrived at a position corresponding to theselected track, thereby causing operation toreturn to track following, which has previouslybeen described in connection with Fig. 9. It will beunderstood that, if upon retum to track following,the track and sector decoder 78 Fig. 6 determinesthat the laser beams are on the wrongtrack, then a short seek operation is initiated asdescribed previously in connection with Fig. 10.
