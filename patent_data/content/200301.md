# Method and apparatus for evaluating surface and subsurface features in a semiconductor.

## Abstract
A periodically modulated laser beam 28 is applied to the surface of the semiconductor sample 22 to generate a periodic electron hole plasma. This plasma interacts with features in the sample 22 as it diffuses. The plasma affects the index of refraction of the sample 22 and the changing plasma density is monitored using a He Ne Laser probe beam 42 . The probe beam 42 is reflected to a photodetec tor 50 which supplies a signal to a processor 32 which, from the photodetector signal measures the reflectivity of the surface of the sample 22 . The plasma induced periodic changes of reflectivity of the surface of the sample 22 to yield information about the sample, such as ion dopant concentrations, residue deposits and defects, which is extracted by the processor 32 .
