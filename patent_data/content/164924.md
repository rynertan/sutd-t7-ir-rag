# STEP COVERAGE METHOD FOR DIELECTRICS IN VLSI CIRCUITS

## Abstract
Particularly for use in multilevel metallization structures in which the underlying topography consists of fine and sharply contoured conductor lines produced by dry etching, conformal or near planar dielectric coatings are produced by depositing a dielectric layer 24 to a thickness over the conductor 14 of at least three times the conductor thick ness. The dielectric 24 is then anisotropically etched back to a thickness comparable with that of the underlying conduc tor 14 . By this method a smooth dielectric top surface can be obtained without the requirement for multiple processing steps characterizing alternative planarizing techniques.
