# Method of controlling a rotational speed to control a throttle valve.

## Abstract
An engine revolution speed control device includes sensors 8, 9, 10 for detecting parameters representing the engine conditions, an actuator 7 for controlling the reset position of the throttle 13 , a switch 11 producing a signal when the throttle action returns under the control of the actuator 7 and a device 12 which is cyclically driven under the condition that no signal from the switch 11 exits. The device 12 takes in one of the data from the sensors 8, 9, 10 and operates the actuator 7 by a predetermined amount in such a direction as to close the reset opening of the throttle every time that the amount of variation in the data taken in reaches a predetermined value.
