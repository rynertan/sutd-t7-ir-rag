## Description
HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING MICROBIAL HERBICIDES AND CHEMICAL HERBICIDES OR PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS Weeds cost farmers billions of dollars annually in crop losses and in the expense of keeping the weeds under control. Much of the cost of intertillage of row crops, maintenance of fallow, seedbed preparation, and seed cleaning is chargeable to weed control. Another expensive item is suppression of weeds along highways and railroad right of ways, and in irrigation ditches, navigation channels, yards, parks, grounds, and home gardens. Ragweed pollen is the source of annual periodic distress to several million hay fever sufferers. Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, nettles, thistles, sandburs,and puncturevine also bring pain to millions.The barberry bush, which spreads the black stem rust of grains and grasses, can be regarded as a weed. Weeds also serve as hosts for other crop diseases as well as for insect pests. The losses caused by weeds in agricultural production environments include decrease in crop yield, reduced crop quality, increased irrigation costs, increased harvesting costs, decreased land value, injury to livestock, a .d crop damage from insects and diseases harbored by the weeds. Chemical herbicides have provided an effective method of weed control in the past. However, the public has become concerned about the amount of chemicals applied to the food that they consume, to the land on which they live, and to the ground water which they use. Stringent restrictions on the use and development of new herbicides and the elimination of some effective herbicides from the market place have limited economical and effective means for controlling costly weed problems. A problem has been identified after years of use of chemical herbicides on crmnercial agricultural land, i.e., the lack of control of certain weeds has allowed these weeds to take over the areas where, without the use of chemical herbicides, they were excluded by more hardy weeds. Removal of the more competitive weeds with chemical herbicides has left an ecological void that has been filled by the less competitive weeds that are resistant to the herbicides. Weeds that were of minor importance at one time have spread rapidly throughout the areas where they are found and are now considered major weed problems.In addition to the inadequacy of control of all weeds, chemicals also can damage the crop plants, sometimes injure nontarget organisms in the environment, and can leave undesirable residues in water and harvested products and carry over in subsequent crops. Microbial herbicides are plant pathogens which are effective, when used according to the process disclosed herein, in controlling weeds or other undesirable vegetation without adversely affecting the growth and yield of the desired field crop. The composition of a microbial herbicide includes spores or cells of the plant pathogen or any portion of the w9w organism that is capable of infecting the weed. The use of microbial herbicides is becoming an increasingly important alternative to chemical herbicides. This importance is accompanied by the issuance of several patents for microbial herbicides and their use. Some of these patents, by way of illustration, are as follows U.S.3,849,104 control of northern jointvetch with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz. aeschynomene U.S. 3,999,973 control of prickly sida teaweed and other weeds withColletotrichum malvarum U.S. 4,162,912 control of milkweed vine with Araujia mosaic virus U.S. 4,263,036 control of Hydrilla verticillata with Fusarium roseumCulmorum U.S. 4,390,360 control of sicklepod, showy crotalaria, and coffee senna with Alternaria cassiae and U.S. 4,419,120 control of prickly sida, velvetleaf, and spurred anoda with fungal pathogens . Microbial herbicides have been developed specifically for control of weeds which are not adequately controlled by chemical herbicides. Examples includeColletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp. aeschynomene for control of northern jointvetch in rice Alternaria cassiae for control of sicklepod in soybeans, cotton, and peanuts and Fusarium lateritium for control of velvetleaf in soybeans. In each of these cases the weed is not effectively controlled by the chemical herbicides currently labeled for use in the respective cropping system.The factors currently limiting in commercialization of microbial herbicides are the high cost of production, limited spectrum of weed control, and the narrow range of environmental conditions in which these pathogens will infect the host. The effects of herbicides on plant diseases was recently reviewed by Altman Altman, 3. and Campbell,L.C. 1977 Ann. Rev. Phytophathol. 15 373 375 . Altman reported that herbicides may either increase or reduce plant disease and severity. There are five major herbicide effects which may lead to increased disease a a reduction in the biochemical defenses of the host against the pathogen b reduction of structural defenses of the host c stimulation of increased exudation from host plants d stimulation of pathogen growth and or production of chemicals which damage the plant and e inhibition of microflora competing with potential pathogens.There are four major effects of herbicides which lead to decreased disease incidence and or severity a increasedhost biochemical defenses b increased host structural defenses c stimulation of microflora competing with potential pathogens and d a decrease in either the pathogen s growth or its production of chemicals which are damaging to plants. At the current state of chemical herbicide and microbial herbicide art, there is no method of predicting the interaction neutral, antagonistic, or synergistic between amicrobial herbicide and a chemical herbicide in controlling a specific weed or unwanted vegetation. Prior art in the area of microbial herbicide and chemical herbicide interactions indicates that foliar application of mixtures of a microbial herbicide and a chemical herbicide results in antagonism and reduced efficacy of the microbial herbicide. Plant pathogens can break down chemical herbicides and chemical herbicides can be fungicidal Wilson, C.L. 1969 Ann. Rev.Phytopathol. 7 424 . Examples of positive interactions between microbial herbicides and chemical herbicides require that the microbial herbicide be applied either before or after the application of the chemical herbicide Klerk, R.h., Smith, Jr., R.J. and TeBeest, D.O. 1985 Weed Science 33 95 99 . Multiple applications of pest control products is expensive and commercially undesirable. The commercially viable methods for the application of a combination product such as a microbial herbicide and a chemical herbicide are a tank mix, and a package mix. Tank mixing is a process by which two or more components of a pest control program are added to the same spray tank and this mixture is applied to the field. The components may be packaged together package mix or separately tank mix but the components must be compatible when added to the spray tank. Mixtures are applied to the field with one application. Applying a mixture reduces fuel consumption, machinery wear, and operator time and preserves the soil texture by reducing soil compaction. At this stage in the herbicide art there is no known way to predict success, if any, in combining a chemical herbicide with a microbial herbicide. We have discovered that mixtures of microbial herbicides and chemical herbicides, and some chemical plant growth regulators, are synergistic in their activity when applied to the foliage of the host weed of the microbial herbicide. This is the first report of synergy between microbial herbicides and chemical herbicides applied as mixtures. This synergy will greatly increase the value of microbial herbicides by reducing the amount of microbial herbicide applied, reducing the environmental limitations of the microbial herbicide, and increasing the spectrum of weed control of some herbicide treatments. Brief Summary of the Invention The subject invention concerns the unexpected discovery that certain mixtures of microbial herbicides and chemical herbicides, and some chemical plant growth regulators, produce a synergistic effect against target weeds. This synergistic effect significantly enhances the value of the microbial herbicide by reducing the amount of microbial herbicide needed and by extending the range of environmental conditions in which the microbial herbicide will function. Specifically, by using the microbial herbicides and chemical herbicides disclosed herein, in mixture, there is obtained, advantageously, a synergistic effect resulting in kill or suppression of previously uncontrolled weeds or other vegetation. The activity of a microbial herbicide is sensitive to fluctuations in the environment. The majority of the examples which support our discoveries were carried out under greenhouse conditions. The environmental conditions within the greenhouse are more constant than the ambient environment outside the greenhouse. However, the environment within the greenhouse fluctuates daily and the interaction between a microbial herbicide and its host also varies with these changes in environment.The sensitivity of microbial herbicides to environmental fluctuations is one of the major constraints in commercializing a microbial herbicide. This sensitivity to environment explains the lack of consistent control when the same rate of microbial herbicide was applied to weeds on different days. This sensitivity to environment is reduced when the microbial herbicide is combined with a chemical herbicide. The result is effective weed control under a wide range of environmental conditions. The discovery of microbial herbicides and chemical herbicides that produce a synergistic effect in controlling a target weed was unexpected. Salts of chemical herbicides which are organic acids were discovered to be synergistic when applied as mixtures with microbial herbicides. Not all salts of chemical herbicides demonstrated this synergy with all microbial herbicides.However, all salts of chemical herbicides which are active against broadleaf weeds see Table 1 when used with the microbial herbicides which attack broadleaf weeds were fourd to be synergistic, and increase the spectrum of control of some herbicide treatments. Generally, in the practice of the subject invention, the microbial herbicide can be applied at rates between 10E7 to 10E12 propagules per acres, and the chemical herbicide can be applied at rates of 1 2 to 1 32 the rate recommended for weed control on the label of the compound in accordance with EPA regulations, against the target weed. If desired, the chemical herbicides can be used at recommended full rates to achieve a broader spectrum of weed control. Detailed Disclosure of the Invention The synergistic mixtures of microbial herbicides and chemical herbicides of the subject invention make possible the control of weeds which cannot be effectively controlled by either the microbial herbicide or the chemical herbicide alone. The most preferred microbial herbicides of the invention are plant pathogens from the genera Alternaria, Colletotrichum, and Fusarium.

Tablt 4 lists the low and high recommended rates of application of each chemical used in this disclosure and the corresponding concentration of the chemical in parts per million PPM in the spray tank when the chemical is applied in 25 gal per acre. Table 5 summarizes the results of spore germination studies with AC and CT. The fungi were exposed to the herbicides for about 8 hr at the reported concentration in water and then transferred to growth media to determine germination. Percent difference indicates the magnitude and increase or decrease in spore germination after exposure to the chemicals as compared to spores exposed to water only. The range of response of CT 91 to 27 was greater than that of AC 71X to 14 , indicating that CT may be more sensitive to the chemicals than AC. Table 6 summarizes the results of radial growth studies of CC on media amended with chemical herbicides.The concentration of chemicals in the growth medium was adjusted to equal the concentration of each herbicide in a spray tank when the chemical is applied in 25 gal water per acre. All of the treatments reduced the growth of CC over that of non amended medium range 8 to 82 .

Germination and penetration are the most environmentally sensitive stages. The three genera of fungi used as examples in this disclosure are representative of two methods of penetration observed in plant pathogenic fungi. Fusarium and Alternaria spp.penetrate passively through open stomates, lenticels, or wounds in the plant surface Colletotrichum spp. penetrate in the plant surface Colletotrichum spp. penetrate actively after formation of appressoria specialized structures which attach to the host surface and release enzymes which dissolve the cuticle and wall materials, allowing penetration of the infective hyphae and through wounds in the plant surface. The possible interaction of chemical herbicides and the infection process of plant pathogenic fungi is discussed in theExamples. The results of synergy experiments are summarizedIn Table 7. A detailed explanation of each experiment is disclosed in the Examples which follow. Salts of chemical herbicides which are active against broadleaf plants provided synergistic activity when applied in a mixture with the microbial herbicide which is active on the broadleaf weed. Basagran, Blazer, and Scepter are broadleaf chemical herbicides which are salts of organic acids. These herbicides were synergistic with all of the microbial herbicides tested. Hoelon and Fusilade are also salts of organic acids. Hoelon and Fusilade are active against grasses and not against broadleaf weeds or sedges. Hoelon does not have herbicidal activity against broadleaf weeds and would therefore not be expected to be synergistic when combined with a microbial herbicide active against broadleaf weeds. Hoelon is not synergistic when used in combination with C. truncatum for control of Florida beggarweed. Hoelon was, unexpectedly, synergistic withA. cassiae in control of sicklepod. Fusilade, on the other hand, was synergistic when combined with eitherA. cassiae or C. truncatum in control of their respective weed hosts.

Wettable powder formulas of Colletotrichum, Alternaria, and Fusarium are composed of a diluent, wetting agent, and dispersant. Wetting agents and dispersants are surface active agents surfactants which reduce surface tension and promote homogenous distribution during application. A comprehensive list of surfactants is found in McCutcheon s Emulsifiers Deterrents 19LlSI Three to five percent of each is needed in the formula to insure performance of the microbial herbicide. The diluents modify the formula to improve handling, storage, and application. Diluents that have been mixed with microbial herbicides are clays attapulgite, montmorillonite, kaolinite , non phyllosilites talc, diatomaceous earth, vermiculite, synthetic bulking agents and botanicals grain flours, ground plant parts . The formulation and application of the chemical herbicides, disclosed herein, are well known to those skilled in the art.

DEDTO Desmodium tortuosum Sw. DC. The abbreviations used for the microbial herbicides have been presented previously but will be duplicated here. AC Alternaria cassiae CC Colletotrichum coccodes CT Colletotrichum truncatum FL Fusarium lateritium Following are examples which illustrate the products and procedures, including the best mode, for practicing the invention These examples should not be construed as limiting.Example l BasaRran in combination with AC, CC, CT, and FL. Basagran is a herbicide of broadleaf plants. This herbicide is a sodium salt of an organic acid. Basagran reduced the germination of spores of AC and CT Table 5 in addition to slowing the growth of CC Table 6 .Basagran produces synergistic activity in controlling weeds when mixed with microbial herbicides, in spite of the apparent detrimental effect of this herbicide on the germination and growth of the microbial herbicides. The weed control activity of AC and FL was zero when these microbial herbicides were applied alone in these experiments. This lack of activity indicates that the environmental conditions during the experiment were restrictive to disease development. The activity of the AC and Fl is greatly increased, even under these restrictive environmental conditions, by addition of the chemical herbicide. With regard to the tables in this Example and theExamples following, application rates for microbial herbicides are expressed as PPA propagules per acre x 109. Application rates for chemicals are expressed as pounds of active ingredient per acre.

Salts of organic acids frequently act as buffers in biological systems by maintaining the concentration of dissolved gasses and ions e.g., the pH, which is the hydrogen ion concentration .A bicarbonate buffering system maintains the pH and CO2 content of human blood plasma at the correct levels.The buffering capacity of organic acids and their salts is due to the disassociation of the proton, metallic ion or other inorganic ions in aqueous solution. Salts of chemical herbicides are likely to act as buffers whenever they occur in aqueous solution, and, more importantly, when they are mixed with microbial herbicides. In a chemically buffered environment, the microbial herbicide may be able to infect the weed and cause disease under environmental conditions which would otherwise be restrictive. In addition to the buffering capacity described above, salts of organic acids the salt, the ionized acid, or the ion released by the salt may also act on the plant or pathogen to produce the synergistic interaction observed in this Example. Salts of chemical herbicide compounds can be formed from metal cations in combination with the herbicidally active anion. Preferred metal cations are alkali metal cations, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, and rubidium and alkaline earth metal cations, for example, magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium. Other metal cations which can be used to form salts of chemical herbicide compounds are the heavy metal cations, for example, copper, silver, mercury, zinc, cadmium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, tin and lead. Salts of chemical herbicide compounds also can be formed from onium cations, for example, ammonium cations, sulfonium and sufoxonium cations and phosphonium cations. In general, the subject invention includes any salt of an organic acid chemical herbicide compound. Advantageously, tEe salt form used should be soluble or suspensible in the herbicidal formula mixture. The formation of such salts is well known to persons skilled in the chemical herbicide art. Example 2 Blazer in combination with AC, CC, CT, and FL. Blazer is another example of a broadleaf chemical herbicide which is a salt of an organic acid. The environmental conditions during a majority of the experiments was limiting and the microbial herbicides demonstrated little or no weed control activity on their respective hosts.The inhibition of AC and CT spore germination and the reduction in growth of CC was much less than observed with the combinations with Basagran.Microbial Trial Application rate Percent weed controlHerbicide Weed Loc Type Microbial Chemical Microbial Chemical Tank mix AC CASOB CA G 0.57 0.05 0 0 86 CC ABUTH VT F 4100.00 0.40 7 43 62 CT DEDTO CA G 9.3 0.05 0 0 94 FL ABUTH CA G 410.00 0.05 0 0 20 Example 3 Classic in combination with AC, CC, and CT. Classic is a broadleaf herbicide which is an ester. This herbicide is clearly antagonistic to the activity of AC when the mixture is applied to control sicklepod. Classic does not severely inhibit the spore germination of AC, indicating that the antagonistic interaction is possibly affecting the physiology of the interaction between AC and the sicklepod plant. An example might .ncl e interference with stomatal opening which would make penetration of AC into the leaf more difficult. Classic is synergistic in controlling weeds when applied in combination with CC, or CT. Both of these fungi are capable of penetrating the leaf directly without the need for a wound or open stomates .Microbial Trial Application rate Percent weed controlHerbicide Weed Loc Type Microbial Chemical Microbial Chemical Tank mix AC CASOB CA G 0.29 0.02 31 4 21 CC ABUTH ML C 4100.00 0.01 0 0 58 CC ABUTH ML F 4100.00 0.02 0 8 37 CT DEDTO FL F 31.00 0.02 0 16 49Example 4 Fusilade in combination with AC and CT. Fusilade is a chemical herbicide which has activity in controlling monocots. Fusilade is a salt of an organic acid. This formulation should yield some environmental buffering capacity. However, the synergistic activity of this compound and AC and CT was not predictable. Fusilade was stimulatory to germination of AC spores but inhibitory to spores of CT Table 5 .

Hoelon is another chemical herbicide which has activity in controlling monocot weeds. Like Fusilade, Hoelon is a salt of an organic acid. UnlikeFusilade, Hoelon almost completely inactivates CT as a microbial herbicide by preventing spore germination Table 5 . The nature of the inactivation cidal or static has not been determined. In contrast to this interaction,AC demonstrates a synergistic response in controlling sicklepod when applied in combination with Hoelon.Microbial Trial Application rate Percent weed controlHerbicide Weed Loc Type Microbial Chemical Microbial Chemical Tank mix AC CASOB CA G 0.57 0.25 0 4 61 CT DEDTO CA G 9.3 0.25 0 0 0Example 6 Poast in combination with AC and CT. Poast, another monocot herbicide, is a ketone. The interaction of this herbicide with AC for control of sicklepod is dramatic. Neither the fungus nor the chemical demonstrated any control when applied alone. Poast may be capable of stabilizing the environment, modifying the physiology of the fungus, modifl,ig t.e response of the host, or the pd.hv2en was capable of modifying the activity of the herbicide. Poast considerably reduced the germination of AC spores. The spores of CT were completely inhibited. The response of CT spores to Hoelon andPoast is similar.Microbial Trial Application rate Percent weed controlHerbicide Weed Loc Type Microbial Chemical Microbial Chemical Tank mix AC CASOB CA G 0.57 0.05 0 0 100 CT DEDTO CA G 9.3 0.01 7 0 18 Example 7 Scepter in combination with AC and CT. Scepter, a broadleaf herbicide, is a salt of an organic acid. Refer to Example 1 for a discussion of the possible interactions between microbial herbicides and salts of chemical herbicides. Scepter alone has some herbicidal activity against sick3epod. However, the combination of the microbial and chemical herbicides provides greatly enhanced, synergistic, control of sicklepod. The activity of CT and Scepter for control of Florida beggarweed is not as dramatic as that demonstrated with AC. Neither the CT nor Scepter were capable of damaging Florida beggarweed alone. The combination killed one third of the weeds.Microbial Trial Application rate Percent weed controlHerbicide Weed Loc Type Microbial Chemical Microbial Chemical Tank mix AC CASOB CA G 0.29 0.01 31 17 76 CT DEDTO CA G 31.00 0.15 0 0 33 E, amDle 8 Sencor in combination with AC and CT. Sensor and Surflan Example 9 are non selective herbicides which are normally applied to fields as a replant treatment.Sencor and Surflan cannot be applied as post emergence herbicides because they are phytotoxic to most field crops at the rates needed to eliminate the weeds. The interaction between these herbicides and microbial herbicides in controlling weeds is probably a result of increased exudation by the host. Sencor and Surflan will damage some of the cells of the sicklepod when applied at the low rates used in Examples 8 and 9. However, this damage is not enough to significantly reduce the growth and development of sicklepod. The damage is enough to cause cuticular wounds and leakage of cellular contents. This increase in exudation actually uncontrolled release provides extra nutrition for the fungus and increases its rate of growth. In addition to the increase in growth and activity of the fungus, the plant has been damaged and is therefore crippled in its ability to defend against the fungal invasion. The chemical herbicide Paraquat is another non selecC herbicide. This herbicide is known to damage the plant cuticle. If the trend in interactions presented in this disclosure is maintained with further testing, this herbicide should provide a combination of cuticular damage in addition to its biological buffering capabilities. The interaction should be synergistic. Also note that both of these compounds stimulated the germination of AC and CT spores Table 5 .Microbial Trial Application rate Percent weed controlHerbicide Weed Loc Type Microbial Chemical Microbial Chemical Tank mix CASOB CA G 1.10 0.06 0 29 100 CT DEDTO CA G 9.3 0.03 7 92 82 Example 9.
