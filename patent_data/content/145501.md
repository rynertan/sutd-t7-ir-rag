## Description
Description Method of Manufacture of Long Cogged Power Transmission Belts Technical Field This invention relates to manufacture of power transmission belts and in particular to the manufacture of relatively long cogged power transmission belts.Background Art One conventional method of manufacture of a continuous cogged power transmission belt, such as a V belt, comprises forming a cylindrical mandrel with suitable grooves and then forming, in situ, about the mandrel a continuous loop of belt forming material which may be laid up in layers in the conventional manner.In one such manufacture, a preformed pattern is wrapped about the mandrel, or drum. The structural materials are then in layers about the pattern and a cylindrical sleeve is placed around the layers for final forming of the cogged belt by in situ vulcanization. It is conventional in practicing such manufacture to utilize an elongated cog pattern which is cut to size and wrapped around the mandrel to form the endless cogged pattern. It has been found difficult, however, to provide accurately precise spacing of the projections of the cogged pattern and particularly such irregularities occur at the joint between the two ends of the pattern wrapped about the drum. Another problem in such manufacture is the difficulty of utilization thereof where relatively long lengths of belts are required, as the drum construction becomes excessively large and the vulcanizing process is quitd difficult. Another known manufacture of such cogged belts comprises progressive forming of the belt by utilizing platelike cogged molds. The molds are utilized in conjunction with a continuous vulcanizable belt preform element and progressively are associated with successive portions of the belt preform until the entire length of the belt preform is provided with the desired cogged teeth. A problem arises, however, in this manufacturing technique in that the final portion of the belt preform does not, in almost all cases, constitute an accurate multiple of the desired cog pitch and, thus, fractional teeth are formed, so that the belt tends to deform or break at this portion. This is a particularly vexatious problem where relatively long belts are to be manufactured, as cumulative errors in the successive cog forming steps may readily occur.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention comprehends an improved method of manufacture of such relatively long cogged belts wherein a novel method of assuring accurate formation of the final cogged teeth is provided. The invention further comprehends such an improved method of manufacture of cogged power transmission belts wherein the final portion of the belt to be formed with teeth is caused to have a length less than the final length and that belt portion is stretched prior to the forming of the final cog teeth therein so as. to have a length accurately corresponding to the pitch multiple necessary to provide completely formed teeth at both ends of the final portion of the belt. More specifically, the invention comprehends the provision of a method of forming a cogged belt structure including the steps of a extending a continuous looped vulcanizable belt preform element about a pair of axially parallel spaced support members, b pressforming a first preselected length portion of the element disposed between the support members to form a first longitudinally extending series of cogs therein, c vulcanizing the press formed portion, d pressforming a second, similar length portion of the element extending from the first portion and disposed between the support member to form a second longitudinally extending series of cogs therein continuing from the first series, e vulcanizing the second press formed portion, f repeating steps d and e if necessary until a final unformed portion of the belt extending from the last formed series of cogs and disposed between the support members has a length less than the preselected length, g longitudinally stretching the final unformed portion to cause it to have a length approximately equal to the preselected length, h press forming the stretched final unformed portion to form a final longitudinally extending series of cogs therein to define a continuous series of substantially uniformly spaced cogs along the entire length of the looped element, and i vulcanizing the second series of cogs. The invention further comprehends an improved apparatus for forming a cogged belt structure including means for extending means for extending a continuous looped vulcanizable belt preform element about a pair of axially parallel spaced support members, means for press forming a first preselected length portion of the element disposed between the support members to form a first longitudinally extending series of cogs therein, means for vulcanizing the press formed portion, means for causing said press forming means to press form a second, similar length portion of the element extending from the first portion and disposed between the support member to form a second longitudinally extending series of cogs therein continuing from the first series, means for causing the vulcanizing means to vulcanize the second press formed portion, means for causing the repeating of the press forming and vulcanizing steps by the press forming and vulcanizing means until a final unformed portion of the belt extending from the last formed series of cogs and disposed between the support members has a length less than the preselected length, means for longitudinally stretching the final unformed portion to cause it to have a length approximately equal to the second preselected length, means for causing the press forming means to press form the stretched final unformed portion to form a final longitudinally extending series of cogs therein to define a continuous series of substantially uniformly spaced cogs along the entire length of the looped element, and means for causing the vulcanizing means to vulcanize the final series of cogs. The invention further comprehends that the length of the looped element and the preselected length of the final unformed portion are correlated so that the length of the final unformed portion is in the range of approximately 60 to 85 of the preselected length. The invention further comprehends the use of a pair of mold plates for press forming the element portions by compression of the portions seriatim therebetween. Means are provided at the opposite ends of the mold plates for engaging the previously formed cogs at the opposite ends of the stretched final unformed portion to maintain its stretch to the preselected length during the final vulcanization step. The step of stretching the final unformed portions comprises a step of holding the end of the last previously formed series of cogs adjacent the final unformed portion and pulling the element at the opposite end of the final unformed portion away from the held end until the length of the final unformed portion is the desired preselected length. In carrying out the invention, it is desirable to cause the cogs at opposite ends of each of the series to be only partially vulcanized during the vulcanization of that series. The vulcanization of the final series causes complete vulcanization of the cogs at the opposite ends thereof by repeating the partial vulcanization of those cogs as the end cogs of the final series. In the illustrated embodiment, the stretching of the final unformed portion is effected by increasing the spacing between pulleys about which the belt preform is disposed. In the illustrated embodiment, one of the mold plates is formed with a series of grooves to define a series of cogs, and the other of the mold plates has a length less than the cog mold plate so that an end portion of the adjacent series of cogs may be received in the grooves outboard of the second mold plate during the press forming and vulcanization operations. In one embodiment, the face of the noncogged mold plate is beveled at the longitudinally opposite ends thereof. The opposite ends of the mold plates may be provided with cooling means to effect the desired only partial vulcanization of the end cogs of the respective series. The teeth at the opposite ends of the final series may be clamped to the cogged mold plate after the final portion is stretched to the desired length so as to maintain the desired length of the final portion during the final press forming and vulcanization steps. The invention comprehends that the belt preforms may comprise individual V belt preforms, or a wide preform belt subsequently cut to individual V belt configurations in the conventional manner, as desired. The method and apparatus of the present invention are extremely simple and economical while yet providing an improved relatively long cogged belt manufacture wherein the cogged teeth are spaced accurately at the desired pitch at all portions of the belt including the final formed portion in utilizing the progressive mold plate forming technique.Brief Description of the Drawing Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawing wherein FIGURE 1 is a transverse section of a drum illustrating the forming of a belt preform thereon for use in carrying out the manufacture of the invention FIGURE 2 is a fragmentary transverse section of the belt preform FIGURE 3 is a schematic diagram illustrating the arrangement of the belt preform and mold plates of the present invention in carrying out a first step in the manufacture of the relatively long cogged belt FIGURE 4 is a schematic diagram illustrating a further step in the manufacture wherein the final portion of the belt to be provided with the cogged teeth by the mold plates is stretched to accurately locate the previously formed cogged teeth at the opposite ends thereof so as to provide a continuing series of cog teeth of uniform pitch throughout the length of the belt FIGURE 5 is a fragmentary elevation illustrating the disalignment of the previously formed cogged teeth relative to the cogged mold plate prior to the stretching operation FIGURE 6 is a fragmentary elevation illustrating the arrangement of the previously formed cogged teeth as a result of the stretching illustrated in Figure 4 FIGURE 7 is a schematic elevation illustrating a further step in the forming of the cogged belt FIGURE 8 is an enlarged transverse section of the mold plates FIGURE 9 is an enlarged section illustrating the arrangement of the belt and mold plates immediately prior to the clamping of the end cogs to the cogged mold plate FIGURE 10 is a fragmentary perspective view illustrating the step of cutting individual V belts from the wide belt preform subsequent to the completion of the forming of the cog teeth therein FIGURE 11 is a transverse section illustrating a modified form of pressure mold plate FIGURE 12 is a fragmentary enlarged longitudinal section thereof FIGURE 13 is a fragmentary enlarged longitudinal section illustrating the cause of a shoulder mark in the formed belt structure which is by the improved structure of Figure 12 FIGURE 14 is a transverse section of a pair of mold plates for use in practicing the invention where individual V belts are formed concurrently and FIGURE 15 is a fragmentary perspective view of a V belt manufactured by means of the mold plates of Figure 14.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention In the illustrative embodiment of the invention as disclosed in the drawing, a belt preform generally designated 10 is formed in situ on a drum 11. A rubber sleeve 12 is firstly placed about the drum. A rubber layer 13 is wrapped about the sleeve 12. The rubber layer may include short, transversely oriented staple reinforcing fibers 14. A lower cushion rubber sheet 15 is wrapped about the first sheet 14, a tensile cord 16 is spirally wrapped about the lower cushion rubber under a preselected tension, an upper cushion rubber sheet 17 is wrapped about the spirally wrapped tensile cord, and an outer core rubber sheet 18 is wrapped about the outer cushion rubber sheet 17.At least one sheet of rubberized elastic duck 19 is wrapped about the outer core rubber sheet 18. The unvulcanized belt 10 is removed from drum 11 and entrained about a pair of axially spaced pulleys 20 and 21, as seen in Figure 3. In the illustrated embodiment, the axle 22 of pulley 21 is displaceable away from and toward the axle 23 of pulley 20 so as to stretch the belt preform 10, when desired. The cogged teeth forming means comprises a air of platen 24 and 25 outwardly of the belt 10 and a platen 2 6 26 intermediate the two lengths 1 ova and lOb of the belt preform extending between the pulleys 20 and 21. The upper platen 24 carries an outer mold plate 66 having a flat inner surface 27 and cooling means 28 at its opposite ends. The lower platen 25 carries a similar outer mold plate 29 having a planar inner surface 30 and cooling means 31 at its opposite ends. Outboard of the opposite cooling ends 28 are a pair of clamp plates 32 and 33 and outboard of the opposite ends 31 of mold plate 29 are a corresponding pair of clamp plates 34 and 35. Inner platen 26 carries a first inner mold plate 36 confronting mold plate 66 and a second inner mold plate 36 confronting mold plate 29. Mold plate 36 defines a serpentinely grooved face 38 and mold plate 37 defines a similarly serpentinely grooved face 39 corresponding to the desired cogged tooth configuration of the final cogged belt to be manufactured. As shown in Figure 3, mold plate 36 is provided adjacent its opposite ends with cooling means 40 and mold plate 37 is provided adjacent its opposite ends with cooling means 41. As shown in Figure 8, mold plate 66 may be provided at its opposite edges with downturned flanges 42 embracing corresponding upturned flanges 43 on the groove mold plate 36 for enclosing the preform belt 10 during the molding operation. The belt preform is provided with a plurality of series of cog teeth by the successive molding of teeth therein between the mold plates in the known manner. Thus, a first set of teeth may be formed in the inner surface of the belt preform by the movement of the mold plate 66 downwardly toward mold plate 36 so as to press form the desired cog teeth in the inner surface of the belt preform element. Heat may be applied to the platen 24 so as to effect vulcanization of the cog toothed portion so press formed between the mold plates. The cooling means at the opposite end of the outer mold plate prevents a complete vulcanization of the teeth at the opposite ends of the series. Upon completion of the vulcanization step, the pulleys are rotated, such as in the direction of the arrows, as seen in Figure 3, so as to bring a next portion of the belt preform into alignment with the mold plates. In this step, the trailing teeth of the first formed series are caused to engage the grooves of the mold 36 in alignment with the cooling means 28 at the lefthand end of the mold plate 66, as seen in Figure 23, so that final vulcanization of the partially vulcanized end teeth of the previous series may be effected during the vulcanization of the next series of teeth between the mold plates 66 and 36. As will be obvious to those skilled in the art, a concurrent similar formation of cog teeth in the length lOb of the belt preform may be effected concurrently with the above described formation of teeth in the illustrated upper length 1Oa so that the complete cogged belt may be formed in one half the time normally required where only a single set of mold plates is utilized. As indicated above, the invention comprehends means for assuring that the final series of teeth formed between a first formed series of teeth and a last subsequent formed series of teeth will have accurate pitch between each of the cog teeth of the final formed series. To effect such desirable accurate formation of the final cogged teeth, the invention comprehends preselecting the length of the final portion of the belt preform to be less than the length of the desired series. In the illustrated embodiment, the length of the final portion is preselected to be approximately 60 to 85 of the preselected series length.This final portion of the belt preform is then stretched so as to have a length accurately conforming to the preselected series length, permitting the final press forming and vulcanization steps to form teeth in the final portion of the belt which are accurately of the desired pitch throughout so that the entire belt, when fully vulcanized and formed, will have accurately similar pitch between all teeth thereof. To this end, pulley 21 is caused to be variably spaced from pulley 20 and, in the illustrated embodiment, as indicated above, axle 22 of pulley 21 is displaceable away from axle 23 of pulley 20 by any suitable means, as will be obvious to those skilled in the art, so as to stretch the final unformed portion 44 of the belt, as illustrated in Figure 4, suitably to bring the end teeth 45 thereof from disalignment with the grooved surface 38 of the mold 36, as seen in Figure 5, to alignment therewith, as seen in Figure 6. At the same time, a similar stretching of the final unformed portion 46 of the belt portion lOb is effected so that each of the final unformed portions 44 and 46 is concurrently made to have a length accurately corresponding to the desired length of the series of cog teeth formed by the mold plates 36 and 37, respectively. The alignment of Figure 6 may be determined visually or by any suitable sensing means, as will be obvious to those skilled in the art. More specifically, as seen in Figure 4, in effecting the stretching of the belt portion 44 by the translated pulley 21, the toothed portion 47 of the last formed series of teeth is clamped to the end portion 48 of the mold 36 by the clamping means 32 outboard of the cooling means 28. As will be obvious to those skilled in the art, a reversely similar clamping of the leading teeth of the first series of teeth produced by mold 36 may be clamped by the clamp 34 at the lefthand end of mold plate 37, as seen in Figure 4. When the end teeth of the previously formed series are aligned with the end grooves, as illustrated inFigure 6, the opposite clamping plates 33 associated with mold plate 36 and 35 associated with mold plate 37, may be brought toward the end portion of the mold plates 36 and 37, respectively, to clamp the aligned previously formed teeth to the ends of the mold plates 36 and 37, thereby maintaining the length of the final unformed portion of the belt preform accurately the necessary length to provide accurate similarly in pitch between the cog teeth and the final formed series.Thus, the complete the formation of the belt at this time, the mold plates 66 and 29 are brought into engagement with the outer surfaces of the final portion of the belt preform sections 10a and lOb and the final steps of press forming and vulcanization is completed, as seen in Figure 7. Upon completion of the forming of the cogged teeth throughout the length of the belt preform, the belt preform may be removed from the pulleys and individualV belts cut therefrom as by suitable knives 50 in the conventional manner, as shown in Figure 10, in forming the final raw edged V belts 51 having uniform pitch through the length thereof, notwithstanding the substantial length thereof. As shown in Figure 9, the length of the final unformed portion, such as portion 44 identified as 1 , is preferably in the range of approximately 60 to 85 of the length of the cog tooth series formed by the mold plates. Thus, a sufficient amount of material is available for stretching to the final aligned configuration of Figure 6. It has been found that maintaining the stretching factor, as indicated above, produces excellent cog tooth configuration, eliminating the problems of the prior art. As shown in Figure 13, where the opposite ends 52 of the outer mold plates 66,29 are perpendicular to the transverse extent of the belt preform 10, a notch mark 53 may be formed as a result of the embedment of the mold plate end portion 52 in the unvulcanized preform material. It has been found that the provision of a bevel, such as bevel 54 illustrated in Figure 12, at the opposite ends of the inner surface 27 of the outer mold plate, effectively eliminates the notch mark 53. In the illustrated embodiment, the height h of the bevel corresponding to the depth of penetration of the mold plate 66,29 into the unvulcanized belt preform 10 is preferably related to the length lc of the cooling section by the formula 2h lc .05 to .40. Referring now to the embodiment of Figures 14 and 15, a modified form of mold plate structure is illustrated to comprise an inner mold plate 55 and an outer mold plate 56 defining longitudinally extending recesses for receiving individual V belt preforms cut from the belt preform 10. Thus, mold 55 is provided with a plurality of longitudinally extending side by sidç V belt receiving grooves 57 and mold plate 56 is provided with a corresponding plurality of pressure surfaces 58 for press forming the preformed V belt elements received in the grooves 57 upon association of the upper mold plate 56 with the lower mold plate 55.Upon completion of the forming of the cog teeth in the final portions of the V belt preforms, the manufacture of the individual belts is completed. Thus, the final V belt 59, as shown in Figure 15, will have a constant pitch throughout the length thereof effected in the same manner as discussed above relative to the first embodiment. The difference between the manufacturing operation represented by Figures 14 and 15 and the first described embodiment resides in the slitting of the preform belt element prior to the cog teeth manufacturing steps in lieu of the slitting of the preform band element 10 subsequent to the forming of the cog teeth throughout the length thereof, as described relative to the first embodiment. In all other respects, the manufacture utilizing the molds plates 55 and 56 is similar to the manufacture as described relative to the first embodiment. Thus, the invention comprehends an improved, simplified manufacture of relatively long cogged tooth power transmission belts and, in particular, raw edgeV belts. The invention comprehends such a manufacture wherein the cogged teeth have a uniform pitch throughout the length of the belt as a result of the novel improved manufacturing process.
