# Apparatus for handling and transporting electric cables.

## Abstract
Apparatus for measuring out a desired length of electric cable 1 and transporting it to a work station A, B or C comprises means 2,3 for supplying the cable along a supply path through a guiding structure which includes a retractable guide element 7c arranged under automatic control to be retracted when the end portion of the cable reaches the downstream end of the supply path so that during further cable supplying, the cable forms a loop 1 which may hang downwardly with the leading end of the cable retained at or adjacent the downstream end of the supply path. When the desired length of cable has been formed into a loop, the cable is severed by cutting means 2a from the supply 2,3 , and with gripping means 4, 5 holding the respective ends of the cable, a lateral displacement device 11, 12 is operated to convey the cable to a work station A, B or C , at the same time bringing further gripping means 4,5 into position ready for the next cycle of operation. At the work station A, B or C any desired operation such as insulation stripping may be effec ted.
