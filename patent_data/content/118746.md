# SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DEVICE

## Abstract
In a semiconductor laser device of the type which includes at least one laminate of a first dielectric layer 2 and a second dielectric layer 3 on at least one of the two facets of a resonator 11 and in which the refractive index of the first dielectric layer is lower than that of the second dielectric layer, the improvement wherein the second dielectric layer consists of an amorphous material containing silicon and hydrogen at its essential constituent elements.
