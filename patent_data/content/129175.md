# EQUALIZER MODIFYING A PHASE OF A GAIN CONTROL SIGNAL TO CARRY OUT EQUALIZATION

## Abstract
In an equalizer for equalizing, by the use of zero forcing algorithm, an input signal obtained by modulating a carrier wave of a carrier frequency at a modulation rate, a specific one of complex control signals is modified into a modified com plex signal and supplied to a specific one of gain control circuits of a transversal filter corresponding to a specific one of additional taps except a central tap. The modified complex signal is produced by rotating a phase of the specific complex control signal by a step equal to an integral multiple of Ï€ 2. Specifically, at least one of real and imaginary parts of the modified complex signal is inverted relative to those of the specific complex control signal. The real and the imaginary parts of the modified control signal are delivered to in phase and quadrature portions of the specific gain control circuit in consideration of the step.
