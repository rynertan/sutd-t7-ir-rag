# Method of cooking juiced foods in a microwave oven.

## Abstract
A method of cooking juiced foods by sensing in situ humidity and temperature environmental conditions of a microwave oven heating cavity. The method monitors the rate of change of the slope of the characteristic humidity curve to indicate the degree or cooking of the juiced foods. By determining the rate of change of the slope of the characteristic humidity curve , the value is indicative of the temperature level of microwave cooking of the juiced foods and can be used to control microwave cooking of the juiced foods.
