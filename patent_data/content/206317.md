# DRAWING MACHINE

## Abstract
This invention provides a drawing machine for pinching and stretching a film like material of the type having rails in stalled extending from the inlet section to the outlet section and returning in the opposite direction from the outlet sec tion back to the inlet section of the drawing machine, and a clip propelling unit moving on the rails for pinching and stretching the film like material, characterized by means for generating mutually repelling magnetic fields between the rails and clips, whereby the clips are movable in the non contact state while floating from the rail guide surfaces, so that no foreign substance is yielded, cleanness of products is enhanced, no noise is generated, work environment is improved, energy is saved, and speed up is attained.
