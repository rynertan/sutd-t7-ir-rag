# Improvements in or relating to the plug drawing of tubes and other hollow items.

## Abstract
A plug 2 for use in the plug drawing of hollow tubes or other stock 3 . A flexible and deformable seal 14, 46, 64 is mounted on the rearward part 11 of the plug. In its relaxed state this seal allows easy insertion of the plug into the stock before drawing begins. In its deformed state, which it is caused to adopt in use, it effectively seals the rearward end of a cylindrical clearance 19 between the plug and the stock, so enabling this clearance to be filled with pressurised lubricant to improve drawing efficiency. The lubricant is supplied through passages 22, 43, 61 formed in the plug and connected to a hollow conduit extending backwards within the undrawn stock. The conduit 50 may be flexible, or may be rigid 12 and then act as a plug bar. The plug may be in two parts 52, 53 which are caused, as drawing begins, to move relative to each other and in so doing to deform the seal.
