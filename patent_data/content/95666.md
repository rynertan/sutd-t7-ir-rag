## Description
TETRAHYDRO BENZO e ISOINDOLINES This invention relates to novel tetrahydrobenzo e3 isoindolines useful in the treatment of hypertension. The adrenergic nervous system plays a major role in the innervation of heart, blood vessel and smooth muscle tissue. Agents capable of interacting with receptor sites within the adrenergic nervous system can result in a variety of physiological responses, including vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and increased or decreased heart rate chronotropic , contractility inotropic and metabolic activity. In the past, various adrenergic agents have been employed to affect these and other physiological responses. However, it is highly desirable to obtain new adrenergic agents which demonstrate a high degree of specificty for differing receptor types within the adrenergic nervous system in order to obtain a desired physiological response separate from other possible, and perhaps less desirable, responses of the system.This property has been lacking from most previously employed adrenergic agents. Thus, the search continues for new and improved adrenergic agents capable of selective interaction with adrenergic receptor sites. It has now been determined that a new class of compounds, the tetrahydro benzo Ce isoindolines, as herein defined, demonstrate an ability to interact specifically with various adrenergic receptor types and are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of hypertension.

The therapeutic activity of the compounds can be demonstrated in vivo by their ability to decrease arterial blood pressure and or heart rate in the spontaneously hypertensive rat as follows. A group ofOkamoto rats, which develop hypertension spontaneously when reaching young adulthood, are deprived of food for a period of 6 hours and are placed in semi restraining wire mesh cylinders maintained at a constant temperature of 36 C. An occluding cuff, operatively connected to a programmed sphygmomanometer, is placed over the tail of each rat of the group and retained near the tail base. The pressure of each cuff is automatically, cyclically increased within the range of from 0 to 250 mm Hg. at the rate of 10 mm Hg. sec., the total inflation and deflation time of each cycle being 50 seconds, with a 10 second rest period between cycles. A photocell is placed distal to the cuff to detect pulses resulting from the forward motion of blood flow with each heartbeat of the rat. As the pressure in the cuff increases, measurable pulses disappear at the point where the cuff pressure equals the arterial blood pressure. Measurable pulses reappear during deflation at approximately the same pressure, and aterial blood pressure is thereby established by cuff pressure at the point of pulse appearance. The heart rate is determined from the arterial pulse wave.A 100 mg. kg. dose of a test compound of formula I is administered orally to each rat of the test group, and five interference free signals are recorded on a Model 7 Grass polygraph for each rat at various measurement periods following administration. By following the foregoing procedure, the tested preferred compounds of the invention are shown to decrease the arterial blood pressure and or heart rate of rats of the group. The compounds of the invention can be administered in any effective pharmaceutically acceptable form to warm blooded animals, e.g., in oral, parenteral or infusable dosage forms, or as a buccal or nasal spray. Suitable parenteral routes of administration include, for example, intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of the compounds. In addition to the active compounds, compositions according to this invention for parenteral injection may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Examples of suitable nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate.Such compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, an dispersing agents.They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water.Besides such inert diluents, compositions may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents. Actual dosage levels of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of active ingredient effective to obtain a desired therapeutic response for a particular composition and method of administration. The selected dosage level therefore depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, on the desired duration of treatment and other factors.Generally, dosage levels of about 0.1 to about 200, more preferably about 0.5 to about 150 and most preferably about 1 to about 125 mg. of active ingredient per kg. of body weight per day are administered orally to a mammalian patient suffering from hypertension. If desired, the daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for administration, e.g., two to four separate doses per day.
