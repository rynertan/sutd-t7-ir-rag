It also has inhibitory actions on numerous other endocrine and gastrointestinal activities in mammals. These inhibitory effects are well documented c.f., P. Brazeau et aQ., Science 179 77 79, 1973 W. A. Mortimer et al., Lancet 1 697 701, 1974 , andC. A. Meyers at al., in Gastrointestinal Hormones, edited by G. B. J.Glass, New York Raven Press, 1980, pages 363 385, and their importance to the life cycle of mammals is clearly recognized. .Although hundreds of somatostatin analogs have been synthesized and evaluated in an attempt to find agonists, antagonists or competitive inhibitors of said hormone, no entirely satisfactory somatostatin antagonist or competitive inhibitor of this hormone has been available or disclosed in the art. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a novel somatostatin antagonist effective for increasing release of growth hormone, insulin, and glucagon in mammals. Surprisingly, this objective has been achieved with the synthesis of cyclotPro Phe D Trp Lys Thr Bzl , and derivatives and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The novel somatostatin antagonists of this invention are cyclic pentapeptides depicted by formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable,salts thereof, having the following amino acid sequence EMI2.1 wherein X is phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, tryptophyl, 4 chlo rophenylalanyl, 4 bromophenylalanyl, 4 fluorophenylalanyl, histidyl, 5 fluorotryptophyl, 5 chlorotryptophyl, 5 bromotryptophyl, 5 methoxytryptophyl, 5 methyltryptophyl, 4 methoxyphenylalanyl, 4 benzyloxyphenylalanyl, 4 methylphenylalanyl, or EMI3.1 Y is D tryptophyl, D phenylalanyl, D 4 chlorophenyl alanyl, D 4 bromophenylalanyl, D 4 fluorophenylalanyl,D 4 methoxyphenylalanyl, D 4 benzyloxyphenylalanyl,D 4 methylphenylalanyl, D tyrosyl, D 5 fluorotryptophyl,D 5 bromotryptophyl, D 5 chlorotryptophyl, D 5 methoxytryptophyl, D 5 methyltryptophyl or D histidyl Z is lysyl or arginyl Thr is threonyl and R1 is hydrogen, benzyl or substituted benzyl, connected to the threonyl amino acid residue through its 3 oxygen atom. The R1 group referred to above may thus be illustrated as follows EMI3.2 wherein R2 is hydrogen, halogen including fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, C1 C4 alkoxy preferably methoxy or C1 C4 alkyl preferably methyl . Preferred compounds of the invention have the formula I structure wherein R1 is hydrogen or benzyl Z is lysyl, and X and Y represent chiral amino acid residues selected from those described for X and Y An especially preferred cyclic pentapeptide somatostatin antagonist of this invention is the cyclotPro Phe D Trp Lys Thr Rl 3 which may be illustrated as follows EMI4.1 wherein Phe is phenylalanyl D trp is D tryptophyl Lys is lysyl Thr is threonyl, and R1 is hydrogen or benzyl. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as used in the present specification, is intended to mean non toxic acid addition salts which are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry. Among those of particular interest in the present invention are the hydrochloride, phosphate, sulfate, laurate, citrate, gluconate, succinate acetate, and oleate salts of the formula I compounds. These salts are readily prepared by methods well known in the art.

Preparative HPLC can be performed on a thick walled glass column 2.5 x 45 cm containingWhatman LRP 1 reverse phase packing C18 silica 13 20 Mm pumped with Fluid Metering Company pump and pulse damper and amino acid analyses can be run on a Beckman 119 CL analyzer and processed with a System AA computing integrator. Amino acid derivatives utilized in the preparation of the compounds of the present invention are available from several chemical supply houses including Bachem, Inc., Torrance, California and ChemicalDynamics, Inc., Plainfield, New Jersey. Conveniently, the formula I peptides of this invention, cyclo Pro X Y Z Thr R13, can be prepared beginning with the appropriate a amino protected amino acid coupled to an appropriate resin, such as a polystyrene resin with one two percent by weight of divinyl benzene as a cross linking agent. Protecting groups for the amino acids include t butyloxycarbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl, diisopropyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, and the like but, t butyloxycarbonyl or isopropyloxycarbonyl are generally preferred. In the process, FMOC Z Boc Thr Bzl Pro X Y O CH2 resin is prepared beginning with the appropriate Boc Y Merrifield resin, where Y is D Trp,D Phe, D Tyr, D 5 F Trp, D 5 Br Trp, D 5 Cl Trp, D 5 OCH3 Trp, D 5 CH3 Trp, D 4 F Phe, D 4 Cl Phe, D 4 Br Phe, D 4 CH3 Phe, D 4 CH30 Phe, D 4 Bzl O Phe, or D His. The resin is placed in the reaction vessel of the peptide synthesizer which has been programmed to carry out the following work wash cycle a methylene chloride, b 33 TFA in methylene chloride, c methylene chloride, d ethyl alcohol, e methylene chloride, f 10 triethylamine in methylene chloride, and g methylene chloride. The washed resin with the Boc group removed is then stirred with t Boc X , where X is Phe, Tyr, Trp, 4 Cl Phe, 4 Br Phe, 4 F Phe, 4 CH3 Phe, 4 CH30 Phe, t4 Bzl O Phe, 5 F Trp, 5 Cl Trp, 5 Br Trp, 5CH30 Trp, 5 CH3 Trp, His orEMI7.1 and diisopropylcarbodiimide in methylene chloride. The protected attached amino acids are then cycled through steps b through g in the above wash program. Thereafter, the following amino acids are coupled by the same cycle of events t Boc Pro, t Boc Thr R1 and FMOC Z Boc, wherein R1 is benzyl or substituted benzyl, and Z isLys or Arg.These steps provide the FMOC Z Boc Thr R1 pro X Y O CH2 resin. Removal of the protected peptide from the resin by treatment with a ten fold excess of hydrazine in methanol is accompanied by loss of the base sensitive FMOC group to give H Z Boc Thr R1 Pro X Y NHNH2, which is cyclized with hydrochloric acid and isoamylnitrite to give cyclo Pro X Y Z Boc Thr Ri 3. Treatment of this peptide with 90 TFA in water containing 1 ethanedithiol then yields the desired somatostatin antagonist of this invention cyclo Pro X Y Z Thr Ri . These reactions are graphically illustrated in the Flow Diagram I below FLOW DIAGRAM IEMI8.1 Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may also be prepared by the process hereinafter deacribed. After conventional solid phase assembly beginning with 1 mmole of Boc Phe Merrifield resin 1 cross linked , the protected peptide hydrazide, H D Trp Lys Cl Z Thr Bzl Pro Phe NHNH21 is cleaved from the support by treatment with hydrazine in methanol and isolated by a procedure described by D. F. Veer at al.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A., 75 2636 2640, 1978 .Without further purification, the hydrazide is converted to the azide, neutralized with triethylamine, and cyclized in DMF solution to yield the protected ninhydrin negative material, cyclo Pro Phe D Trp Lys Cl Z Thr Bzl . When this protected ninhydrin negative material is hydrogenated at atmospheric pressure and room temperature over 10 Pd on charcoal, the compound, cyclotPro Phe D Trp Lys Thr Bzl , is formed and found to be a very effective somatostatin antagonist.When, however, the protected crude ninhydrin negative material is deprotected by treatment with HF anisole under standard conditions, as described by G. T. Engberg at awl., Nature, 293 222 223, 1981 , and purified by preparative HPLC eluting with 10 55 gradient of CH3CN in 20 AcQH, the reaction yields the pure peptide, cyclo Pro Phe D Trp Lys Thr , which has somatostatin antagonist activity. It is also found that HF treatment of the active somatostatin antagonist, cyclo Pro Phe D Trp Lys ThrCBzl , converts it to the peptide, cyclo ProPhe D Trp Lys Thr , which also has somatostatin antagonist activity. The above reactions are graphically illustrated in Flow Diagram II below.

The compounds of formula I are useful as somatostatin antagonists and are effective for increasing the release of growth hormone, insulin, and glucagon, in mammalian hosts, when administered thereto at dosages of from 0.000002 to 1 mg kg of mammalian body weight per day. The formula I compounds may be administered orally in the form of a feed additive or as a bolus, pill, tablet, oral gel, or the like, designed to deliver the active compound at the dosage level desired. They may also be administered parenterally by intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intravenous injection, or as a transdermal or nasal spray. As will hereinafter be shown, injection of formula I peptide into rats blocks the inhibitory effects of exogenous somatostatin on growth hormone, insulin, and glucagon release. In practice, it is also found that in fasted rats, basal hepatic portal insulin and glucagon levels are significantly increased after treatment with cyclo Pro Phe D Trp Lys Thr Bzl 3 and, further, that plasma growth hormone levels in NEM3UTALe anesthetized and stimulated rats are increased after injection with the above said compound. The following examples further illustrate the present invention, but are not intended to be limitative thereof. NEMBUTALs sodium pentobarbital is a product of AbbottLaboratories.

The mixture is stirred at 350C for 45 minutes and then added to 1.5 ml of dimethylformamide DMF and cooled to 250C.The reaction mixture is then neutralized to pH 7.5 with diisopropylethylamine and maintained at 250C for 24 hours and SOC for an additional 24 hours. Evaporation of the DMF gives the above identified product as a brown oil that exhibits a major spot by thin layer chromatography tlc .

The solution is stirred at ambient temperature for 40 minutes and then evaporated to an oil. The resulting oil is dissolved in 50 acetic acid and eluted on a column 2.5 x 95 cm of Sephadex G 15 with 505 acetic acid.Lyophilized material from a major peak absorbing at 280 nm is then applied to a column of Whatman LRP 1 octadecylsilanesilica and eluted with a linear gradient of 10 to 15 acetonitrile in 20 acetic acid solution. The major peak is collected and lyophilized to give the required peptide as a white, fluffy powder 90 mg .

EXAMPLE 5Preparation of cyclo L prolyl L phenylalanyl D tryptophyl L lysyl L threonyl The dried peptide, cyclo L prolyl L phenylal anyl D tryptophyl L lysyl 0 benzyl L threonyl 1 is placed in a vessel suitable for HF cleavage. This vessel also contains a magnetic stirring bar. A small quantity of anisole sufficient to wet the peptide is added to this vessel. The vessel is next connected to an HF line and placed under vacuum to remove any air therein. The vessel is then cooled to about 780C with a dry ice acetone bath. Doubly distilled HF about 10 ml gm of peptide is added to the vessel. The dry ice acetone bath is then removed from the vessel and replaced by an ice water bath. The vessel s contents are vigorously stirred for about 45 minutes while the vessel remains immersed in the ice water bath. Most of the HF in the vessel is then removed by water aspiration.After the majority of HF is removed by water aspiration, the remaining HF and anisole are removed via a vacuum pump to afford the title peptide. EXAMPLE 6Evaluation of psptide effects on growth hormone insulin and glucagon release in mammals using the rat as the test species In this evaluation, the procedures described by W. A. Mutphy et al., Endocrinology, 109 491 495 1980 , were employed. In growth hormone GH experiments, male rats Charles Rivers were anesthetied with NEMBUTAL 5 mg per 100 g BW which also served to maintain stimulated plasma GH levels. Exactly 30 minutes after the rats were anesthetized, 0.5 ml of saline or the test peptide in saline was administered as a sc bolus. A 1 ml blood sample was drawn from the jugular vein 15 minutes after the injection. For examining blocking effects of the analog on somatostatin, the cyclic peptide was given five minutes prior to somatostatin. GH levels were determined using NIADDKD rat GH RIA components. Data obtained are reported in Table I below.

From the above data, it can be seen that the compound of the present invention and an unprotected relative thereof were evaluated to determine the effects of both peptides on NEMBUTAL stimulated GH release in rats. Radioimmunoassayable GH levels in contro l stimu lated jugular blood 648 177 ng ml showed an increase to 1265 t 318 after injection with 0.3 pg lOO g body weight of the unprotected analog cycla Pro Phe D Trp Lys Thr whereas, the radioimmunoassayable GH levels in control stimulated jugular blood of 497 t 80 ng m1 rose significantly to 1724 t 393 ng ml after injection of 0.2 g lO0 g body weight of the compound of the invention, i.e., the protected compound cyclo Pro Phe D Trp Lys Thr Bz1 1. From the above data, it appears that the antagonist effect of the compounds of the present invention is not wholly dependent on the presence of the aromatic benzyl protecting group on the threonine.
