# Treatment of sodium tungstate leach liquor containing dissolved silica, phosphorus, and fluorine impurities.

## Abstract
Basic sodium tungstate leach liquor is treated to reduce the concentration dissolved therein of silica, phosphorus and fluorine impurities in a process which comprises providing a small but effective amounfof magnesium in the liquor to maxi mize removal of silica and phosphorus from solution in the li quor while maintaining the liquor temperature between about 60 C and about 100 C and the liquor pH between about 9 and about 11, filtering the liquor, adjusting the liquor pH to between about 6 and about 8 and the liquor temperature to between about 20 C and about 60 C, and then providing a small but ef fective amount of aluminum hydroxide in the filtered liquor to maximize removal of fluorine form solution in the liquor while maintaining the liquor temperature between about 20 C and about 60 C and the liquor pH between about 6 and about 8.
