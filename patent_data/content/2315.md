# Apparatus and method for producing coated film.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus and a method for producing a coated film in which a cooled polymeric tubular extrudate is coated, reheated and inflated to yield an oriented, coated tubular film. The apparatus includes a coating head comprising a rotatable assembly including a support member 13 providing an orifice 14 through which the tubular extrudate may be fed, a plurality of spreading members 19 spaced apart around the orifice, mounting means 15 for each of the spreading members operatively associated with the support member and displaceable relative thereto, and means 21 for biasing each of the spreading members into engagement with the tubular extrudate. Liquid coating medium is suitably deposited on the extrudate from a spray assembly, and the coating assembly is rotated around the extrudate thereby spreading and polishing the deposited medium to yield a uniformly coated film. The system is particularly suitable for the production of polymeric packaging films having an antistatic coating on the surface thereof.
