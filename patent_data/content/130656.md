# Ratio shifts in multi ratio automatic transmissions.

## Abstract
The supply of hydraulic fluid to actuators BR of friction devices for engaging the various ratios in an automatic transmission from a high pressure source 42 is controlled by relay valves RV which maintain the pressure in the ac tuators at a multiple of a control pressure. The release of an outgoing friction device BR4 and engagement of an incom ing device BR3 are controlled by a shift timing valve STV3, 4 and shift timing trimmer valve TV3, 4 associated with each friction device. During an upshift, the outgoing trimmer valve TV4 is allowed to partially release its pres sure and thereafter to continue to lose pressure at a reduc ed rate until the pressure in the incoming brake BR3 is suf ficient i.e., when the brake BR3 can withstand driving reac tion to operate the shift timing valve ST4 to empty the trimmer TV4 . During a down shift, the shift timing valve STV3 acts immediately to empty the trimmer valve TV3 and release the brake BR3 substantially instantaneously.
