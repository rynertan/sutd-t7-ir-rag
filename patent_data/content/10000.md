## Description
MASTIC, CAULKING, SEALANT AND ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING PHOTOSENSITIVE COMPOUNDS AND METHOD OF REDUCING THEIR SURFACE TACK This invention is ccncerned with improved mastic, caulking, sealant or adhesive compositions containing photo sensitive compound which compositions yield a finished product whose surface becomes tack free relatively quickly upon exposure to actinic radiation while the remainder of the product substantially retains its flexibility upon extended exposure to the source of active radiation. The invention is also concerned with the use of such compositions, particularly in a method of reducing surface tackiness. Well known caulk or sealant compositions are exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 3,561,996. An example in that patent is a caulking composition of 82.68 solids as follows 4 a A caulking composition of 82.6 solids is made up by mixing 430.17 lbs. of a 55 solids aqueous dispersion of an emulsion copolymer of 81.5 ethyl acrylate, 15 methyl methacrylate, and 3.5 itaconic acid, 9.46 lbs. of tert octylphenoxypoly 39 ethoxy ethanol, 1Q.65 lbs. of sodium hexametaphosphate, 124.21 lbs. of a plasticizer for the copolymer an oxypropylene derivative of m,p cresylic acid , 26.91 lbs. mineral spirits, 1.27 lbs. of a 30 aqueous poly methacrylic acid, 692.06 lbs. of pigment grade calcium carbonate extender, and 17.22 libs. of titanium dioxide pigment. U.S. Patents 2,865,877 and 2,865,878 disclose as pigment dispersants 1 a water soluble salt of a copolymer of maleic anhydride with an olefin such as diisobutylene, and 2 a water insoluble ethylene oxide adduct of an alkyl phenol, the product being useful in coatings. The watersoluble salts are extremely hard and inflexible, and are unsuitable as major components of caulks. U.S. Patent 2,889,297 discloses polyvinyl acetate adhesives plasticized with similar adducts of propylene oxide and alkyl phenols. Ester type plasticizers in the form of oil modified alkyds have been disclosed for caulks, particularly solvent based caulks, as shown in U.S. Patents 3,786,020, 3,919,146 and 3,759,915. U.S. Patent 3,554,942 discloses aqueous sealant or spackling compositions comprising water soluble acrylic copolymer and a water soluble cellulose ether. U.S. Patent 2,986,507 discloses a polymerized, solid, fusible composition, prepared from acrylate and methacrylate monomers, containing thermal catalyst and a photoin solublizer which, prior to being subjected to ultraviolet irradiation, is soluble in organic solvents but after sufficient ultraviolet irradiation is insoluble in such solvents. The composition of the patent is employed in end applications such as making sheets, films, rods, granules, molds, casts, or coatings. U.S. Patent 3,661,744 discloses a photocurable liquid polymer composition including a liquid polymer component, a polythiol component, and a photocuring rate accelerator.Upon curing in the presence of actinic light, the products of the patent may serve as sealants, coatings, adhesives and molded articles. U.S. Patents 3,274,142, 3,297,630 and 3,966,794 disclose polyene polythiol compositions containing a photocuring rate accelerator. Generally, sealants require a delicate balance of properties to yield a finished product which will become tack free relatively quickly under cure conditions, for example under exposure to outdoor conditions, while still retaining its flexibility upon extended exposure to the same conditions For most thermoset solvent based sealants, this balance of properties is principally achieved by controlling the crosslink density obtained with ambient cure processes. At high cross link density, a sealant will undergo cure sufficiently quickly that it will demonstrate rapid loss of surface tack. However, high crosslink density in a sealant is usually accompanied by undesirable properties such as loss of elongation, stability, and low temperature flexibility and an undesirable increase in tensile strength and hardness. Thus, there.exists a need in the art for sealant compositions which will become tack free quickly at the surface under cure conditions while still retaining throughout the bulk of the composition a relatively low level of crosslinking. We have now found that the incorporation of photosensitive compounds into mastic, caulking, sealant and adhesive compositions may reduce the surface tack of such compositions without unduly stiffening the body of the compositions. According to the invention there is provided a puttylike mastic, caulking, sealant or adhesive composition comprising a about 90 to 10 by weight, solids basis, of a binder consisting essentially of an addition polymer and b about 90 to 10 by weight, solids basis, of one or more additives selected from the group con sisting of an emulsifier, a dispersant, an organic solvent, a base, a pigment, a filler, a dye, a defoamer, a thickener, a polyvalent metal containing complex or salt as a drier, an adhesion promoter, and a plasticizer, the improvement comprising blending with the binder and additives from a and b above a photosensitive compound which imparts to the cured mastic, caulking, or sealant com position upon exposure to a source of actinic radiation the property wherein the cured surface of the composition is rendered tack free while the remainder of the composition retains its flexibility and wherein the cured surface is rendered substantially mildew resistant. In a preferred embodiment, the composition comprises a about 10 to 90 by weight solids basis, of a binder consisting essentially of an addition polymer having a backbone of copolymerized ethylenically unsaturated monomers, one of which is an unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer, a portion of said carboxylic acid monomer optionally being modified by having pendant groups selected from ester amide and ester groups, the polymer backbone having units of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 is H, C1 C5 alkyl, halogen, CH2COOR, C00R, or CH2COOH, R Cl C8 alkyl R2 is H, COOH, CONH2, or COOR, wherein .R is C1 C8 alkyl R3 is at least one of H and at least one C1 C8 alkyl radical, at least a portion of R3 being H to give free COOH groups X is derived from at least one other vinyl monomer and is optional and Y is selected from the group consisting of R4 NR5 CO R6 and R7 0 CO R6 wherein R4 is an alkylene radical having from 2 to 18 linear carbon atoms between the nitrogen and the oxygen atoms R5 is H or C1 C8 alkyl R5 is an unsatur ated, oxidatively air curable alkyl radical and R7 is CH2 CH Oij CH2 or CH CH2OH CH2 the units in parenthesis being in any order, which polymer, when it is so modified, is derived from the esterification of some of the carboxyl groups in the backbone by at least one member selected from the group consisting of unsaturated fatty acid hydroxyamide and unsaturated fatty acid glycidyl ester, the amount of unsaturated carboxylic acid in the backbone, before or without modification, being from 0.25 to 40 weight on the basis of copolymerized monomers, the molar ratio of free carboxyl groups in the backbone before or without modification thereof to the hydroxyamide or glycidyl ester being from about 1 0.9 to 1 0.2, the polymer backbone having from 0 to no more than about 10 by weight of the units having the formulaEMI5.1 the Tg of the backbone polymer free of pendant ester amide or ester groups being below about 100C, preferably below about OOC b about 90 to 10 by weight, solids basis, of one or more additives selected from the group consisting of an emulsifier, a dispersant, an organic solvent, a base, a pigment, a filler, a dye, a defoamer, a thickener, a polyvalent metal containing complex or salt as a drier, an adhesion promoter, and a plasticizer. the improvement comprising blending with the binder and additives from a and b above a photosensitive compound which imparts to the cured mastic, caulking, or sealant composition upon exposure to a source of actinic radiation the property wherein the cured surface of the composition is rendered tack free while the remainder of the composition retains its flexibility and wherein the cured surface is rendered substantially mildew resistant. Examples of R1 and R2 are R1 R2 Acid for Carboxyl SourceH H acrylicCH3 H methacrylicH COOH maleic, fumaricH CODE2 maleamic C1 COOH chloromaleic CH2COOCH3 H methyl acid itaconateCH2COOH H itaconicCH2COOH COOH aconiticH COOCH3 half ester of maleic Preferably R1 is H or C C5 alkyl, such as methyl,R2 is H and, when Y is R4 NR CO R6, R5 is methyl and R6 contains 18 carbon atoms or less, and, when Y is R7 O CO R6, R6 contains from 10 to 22 carbon atoms. More 4 preferably R contains 2 or 3 carbon atoms in a chain joining the nitrogen and oxygen atoms. R6 is preferably derived from one or more of oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. The matter in the right hand parenthetical group, of course, represents that portion of the addition polymerized polymer backbone having free carboxyl groups as well as carboxyl groups which are esterified by the various alcohols conventionally used. The optional portion X , is derived from any of the well known unsaturated addition polymerizable vinyl monomers, defined below, in addition to those which give units of formula II, above. The backbone polymer, before or without esterification bythe hydroxyamide, contains units of the formula EMI7.1 and optionally the fatty acid amide having the formulaEMI7.2 wherein the symbols used have the same meanings as given above. The backbone polymer, before or without esterification by the glycidyl ester, contains units of the formulaEMI7.3 and optionally X the glycidyl ester having the formulaEMI7.4 wherein the symbols used have the same meaning as given above. An essential characteristic of the ultimate elastomeric polymer obtained by esterifying pendant COOH groups of the backbone by reaction with the unsaturated fatty acid hydroxyamide or glycidyl ester, as concerns caulks, is that there be less than about 10 percent, and more preferably less than about 5 percent, on a weight basis, of the groups represented by the formula EMI7.5 wherein R1, R2, and Y are as above. If this criterion is not observed, over a long period of time the caulk may become too brittle or hard for proper expansion and contraction of abutting surfaces in contact with a single caulk bead, or the bead may become so hard as to preclude easy repair. Without a silane of the type used in solvent based caulks, wet adhesion on upright surfaces may be defective, especially if morethan 5 percent of said groups by weight is present. The backbone polymer is a water insoluble vinyl addition polymer containing the requisite proportion of carboxyl COOH groups as described herein. The backbone polymers per se are well known in the art and form no part of the present invention. The proportions of monomers in the backbone are such that there is at least 0.25 percent and no more than 40 percent, preferably less than 25 percent, of unsaturated carboxylic acid, by weight, in the monomers going into said backbone polymer. An especially preferred range is from about 1 percent to 5 percent, and the optimum is considered to be in the range of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percentIn reacting the hydroxyamide or glycidyl ester of the unsaturated fatty acid with free carboxyl COOH groups in the backbone polymer, the mole ratio of COOH amide or ester is in the range of from 1 0.2 to 1 0.9, preferably from 1 0.3 to 1 0.7. A particularly useful range is from 1 0.4 to 1 0.6.It is advantageous to have a substantial proportion of free carboxyl groups associated with a minimum of the drying oil functionality for proper adhesion and for maximum longterm flexibility necessary in the cured caulks. In the backbone, hard monomers such as styrene or methyl methacrylate are useful in the range of O to 75 percent, preferably 5 to 25 percent, with soft monomers such as ethyl or butyl acrylate forming from about 75 percent to about 99.75 percent of the total monomers, preferably 70 to 94 percent. The preferred backbone polymers are those of vinyl addition polymer type, including as an essential component, the a,ss unsaturated carboxylic acid, preferably acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. Other useful copolymerizable acids are named in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,098,760 and 3,261,796, additional examples being given below. To amplify, the unsaturated carboxylic acid may be asimple monocarboxylic acid, a polycarboxylic acid, or may be a partial ester or half amide of such a,5 unsaturated polycarboxylic acids, and salts thereof with a volatile base such as ammonia, or with a volatile watersoluble amine such as dimethylamine, triethylamine, triethanolamine, morpholine, N methyl morpholine, picoline and the like.Examples of copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic or polycarboxylic acids are sorbic, acryloxyacetic, acryloxypropionic, cinnamic, vinyl furoic, a chlorosobic, methacryloxypropionic, methacryloxyacetic, p vinylbenzoic, acrylic, methacrylic, maleic, fumaric, aconitic, atropic, crotonic, and itaconic acid, or mixtures thereof, with itaconic acid and the a,B unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, particularly methacrylic acid and acrylic acid, being preferred. Other copolymerizable acid monomers include the alkyl half esters or partial esters of unsaturated polycarboxylic acids such as of itaconic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid, or the partial amides thereof. Preferred half esters are the lower alkyl C1 to C6 esters such as methyl acid itaconate, butyl acid itaconate, methyl acid fumarate, butyl acid fumarate, methyl acid maleate, and butyl acid maleate. Such partial esters and partial amides are considered to be a,6 unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, µ and the term as used herein includes such esters and amides. The term vinyl monomer as used herein means a monomer comprising at least one of the following groups vinylidene CH2 vinyl CH2 CH , and vinylene CH CH , whether homopolymerizable or not, giving units corresponding to X and to formula II. Examples are the a,ss ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids and esters and amides thereof, a,ss ethylenically unsaturated aldehydes, a,B ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids and esters, amides, half esters, and half amides thereof, a,ss ethylenically unsaturated nitriles, hydrocarbons such as a olefins, conjugated diolefins, vinylaryl compounds, vinyl alkyl ethers, vinyl halides, vinylidene halides, vinyl sulfides, vinyl acryloxy compounds esters of saturated carboxylic acids and ethylenically unsaturated alkanols , vinyl amines and salts thereof, vinyl ureido monomers, vinyl compounds having heterocyclic nitrogencontaining HN groups, and halogen, hydroxyalkyl, or aminoalkyl substituted derivatives thereof, whether homopolymers or copolymers. The vinyl polymers and methods for their preparation form no part of the present invention, and any such polymer may be treated in accordance with the present invention. For examples of wellknown vinyl polymers and methods of preparing the same, see Polymer Processes, Schildknecht, Interscience, N.Y. 1956 , pp. 111 174. Mixtures of different polymers are useful. Specific examples of suitable monomers which may be copolymerized to obtain the water insoluble polymers for use according to the invention in addition to the unsaturated acid monomers and esters thereof with alkanols having one to 20 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, pentadecanol and the like, are acrolein, methacrolein, ethylene, propylene, isobutene, butadiene, isoprene, chloroprene, styrene, vinyltoluene, vinyl methyl ether, vinyl isobutyl ether, vinyl chloride, vinyl bromide, vinyl proplonate, the vinylidene chloride, vinyl sulfide, vinyl acetate, vinyl pyridines, primary amino compounds such as B ss aminoethyl vinyl ether, aminopentyl vinyl ether, secondary amino containing compounds such as secondary amyl t butyl amino ethyl methacrylate, tertiary amino containing compounds such as t dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, and the allied amine salts such as the chloride or hydroxide, ureido monomers such as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,881,155 to Hankies, 3,300,429 to Glavis and highly, and 3,356,627 to Scott, examples being ss ureidoethyl acrylate, ss N,N ethyleneureido ethyl acid maleate, ss ureidoethyl vinyl ether, N vinyl N,N ethyieneurea, N vinyloxyethylN,N ethyleneurea,N methacrylamidomethyl N,N ethyleneurea, and N dimethylaminoethyl TI vinyl DT,N ethyleneurea, ss hydroxyethyl methacrylate,N hydroxyethylacrylamide, N methylolacrylamide, andN dimethylaminoethyl acrylamide. Copolymers and graft, block, or segmented polymers are included. Conventional methods of obtaining the backbone polymers are utilized. Preferred vinyl monomers in addition to the acid, include one or more of an ester of an alpha ,ss unsaturated carboxylic acid, or, when those from which X is derived are used, an unsaturated nitrile, a vinyl halide, a vinylidene halide, a vinyl aromatic, a vinyl alcohol ester, or an unsaturated hydrocarbon. As is described below, these vinyl monomers include the acids mentioned above and esters thereof, as well as known soft and hard monomers. Another of the important, and at times essential monomers, in addition to the acid monomer, usually utilized in a substantial proportion to prepare the backbone polymer, is a resiliency imparting or soft monomer which may be represented by the following formula EMI11.1 wherein ROis H or alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and Rll is the straight chain or branched chain radical of a primary or secondary alkanol, alkoxyalkanol or alkylthiaalkanol, and having up to about 14 carbon atoms, examples being ethyl, propyl, n butyl, 2 ethylhexyl, heptyl, hexyl, octyl, propyl, 2 methylbutyl, l methylbutyl, butoxybutyl, 2 methylpentyl, methoxymethyl, ethoxyethyl, cyclohexyl, n hexyl, isobutyl, ethylthiaethyl, methylthiaethyl, ethylthiapropyl, n octyl, 6 methylnonyl, decyl, dodecyl, and the like, said radicals Roll, when alkyl, having from two to about 14 carbon atoms, preferably from three to 12 carbon atoms, when ROis H or methyl.When ROis alkyl andRll is alkyl, R11 should have from about 6 to about 14 carbon atoms and when ROis H and P11 is alkyl, R11 should have from about two to about 12 carbon atoms, in order to qualify as a soft monomer. Other ethylenically unsaturated copolymerizable vinyl monomers, the homopolymers of which have a much higher Tg, are used in combinations with the above mentioned soft monomers provided they do not adversely affect the desired properties of the caulk e.g. unduly raise the overall Tg .The hard acrylics may be represented by the formula EMI12.1 wherein ROis as above. RA2 is preferably alkyl and is methyl or alkyl having from about 13 to about 20 carbon atoms when R is H, and is alkyl of from one to about five carbon atoms or alkyl of from about 15 to about 20 carbon atoms when P is methyl It can be seen from above that for alkyl acrylates and alkyl methacrylates the T g at first decreases with an increased chain length of the alkyl group and then the Tg again increases, i.e., both hard and soft monomers are known to occur in each group of monomers. Examples of these hard monomers and other hard monomers include methyl acrylate, acrylamide, vinyl acetate, tetradecyl acrylate, pentadecyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, t butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, styrene, pentadecyl methacrylate, vinyl toluene, methacrylamide, and N methylolacrylamide. preferably the binder polymer contains a major proportion more than 50 of units of at least one ester of acrylic acid with an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and a minor proportion less than 50 of units of one or more of at least one ester of methacrylic acid with an alkanol containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. As is known, for a given number of carbon atoms in the alcohol moiety, the extent and type of branching markedly influences the Tg, the straight chain products riving the lower Tg. As is apparent, an important property of the backbone polymer is the T g thereof, and consequently the selection of monomers and proportions thereof depends upon their influence on the Tg The Tg of the polymer must be below 10 C, preferably below 0 C, i.e., it must give a rubbery product and is more preferably below lO0C. The modified backbone polymer containing the pendant ester groups must also have the same Tg requirements. Tg is a conventional criterion of polymer hardness and is described by Flory, Principles of Polymer Chemistry, pp 56 and 57 1953 , Cornell University Press. See also Polymer Handbook , Brandrup and Immergut, Sec. III, pp 61 63, Interscience 1966 . While actual measurement of the Tg is preferred, it may be calculated as described by Fox, Bull. Am. Physics Soc. 1,3, p.123 1956 .Examples of the T of homopolymers and the inherent Tg g thereof which permits such calculations are as follows Homopolymer of T n octyl acrylate 80 C n decyl methacrylate 600C 2 ethylhexyl acrylate 700C n butyl acrylate 56 0C octyl methacrylate 2O0C n tetradecyl methacrylate 9 0C methyl acrylate 9 0C n tetradecyl acrylate 20 0C t butyl acrylate 43 0C methyl methacrylate 105 0C acrylic acid 1060C These or other monomers are blended to give the desired T g of the copolymer. The polymeric backbone is desirably obtained by solution polymerization of one or more of the ethylenically unsaturated acids with other unsaturated monomers including, among the more preferred vinyl monomers, the esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with benzyl alcohol, phenol, or a saturated monohydric aliphatic alcohol, especially an alkanol, having one to 18 carbon atoms, such as cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol, methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, methoxyethanol, ethoxyethanol, methoxyethoxyethanol, ethoxy ethoxyethanol, isobutanol, sec butanol, tertbutanol, any of the pentanols, hexanols, octanols, decanols, dodecanols, hexadecanols, and octadecanols, bearing in mind the required T g and acid monomer.Other preferred comonomers include acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, styrene, vinyl toluene o , m , or p , vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride, to give the X in the foregoing formula. Blends of copolymers may be used. High molecular weight polymers, e.g. 10,000 to several million, obtained by emulsion or solution polymerization or other methods1 and of water insoluble character when in acid form, are used as the backbone polymer. Preferably, the backbone polymer has a molecular weight of 10,000 to 600,000 or more. The compositions of the invention may be applied to a wide variety of substrates, including siliceous substrates such as glass sheets, fiberglass textiles, asbestos sheets, asbestos cement products, concrete, stone, stucco, slate, sandstone, granite, ceramics, and porcelain also fiber reinforced plastic articles such as canoes, boathulls, or other formed articles made out of fiber glass reinforced polyesters or other plastic materials metal such as aluminum, galvanized steel, steel, iron, brass wood ana other suitable building and or structural materials insulating materials such as polyurethane and polystyrene foam metal oxide layers such as those of aluminum oxide and iron oxide leather textiles of cellulose such as of cotton, linen, silk, wool7 rayon, cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate, nylons, polyesters such as polyethylene glycol terephthalate, acrylonitrile polymers, vinylidene chloride polymers and other vinyl or acrylic ester polymers films, pellicles, sheets and other shaped articles of various plastic systems such as of cellulose ethers or esters including hydroxyethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyesters such as polyethylene glycol terephthalate, nylons, vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride polymers and copolymers, methyl methacrylate polymers and copolymers, aminoplast or phenoplast resin, organopolysiloxane resins or rubber. The caulks, mastics, or sealants of the present invention are particularly valuable in that they can be used directly on most of the substrates without the need of a priming coat. The solvents used in the polymerization may be such organic solvents as benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphthas of aliphatic, aromatic, or naphthenic type, such as mineral spirits, acetone, dioxane, etc. Of course, other modes of polymerization can be used. The amount of solvent in the final caulk, sealant, or mastic is from 0 percent to 50 percent based on total weight. Preferably, it is from 5 percent to 20 percent for caulks and up to 50 percent for mastics. For aqueous latex based mastics, caulks, or sealants of the present invention, the solids content is from about 50 to about 90 by weight, preferably from about 60 to about 85. Solids content is kept as high as possible while yet achieving a useful consistency. If the solvent is a reactive or curable solvent such as a drying oil or a liquid polymerizable material, solids content may even be 100 . Component b is present in an amount of from 10 percent to 90 percent by weight of the total solids in the composition depending upon the consistency desired, the presence or absence of thickening agents, the amount and identity of solvent utilized, and so forth. Suitable fillers include calcite, limestone, mica, talc, asbestos fiber or powder, diatomaceous earth, barytes, alumina, slate flour, calcium silicate, clay, colloidal silica, magnesium carbonate, magnesium silicate, and so on. The amounts of solvent, if any, filler, and polymer solids are such as to give the caulking composition a dough like consistency. The weight ratio of inorganic pigment and or filler to binder is from 0 1 clear or translucent, for instance to about 5 1, preferably about 1 1 to 4 1. Among the drying oils from which the drying oil fatty acid amide may be derived are linseed, tung, tall, safflower, isano, soya, dehydrated castor, maleinized or fumarized linseed, oiticica, palm, peanut, corn, walnut, menhaden, dehydrogenated castor, and cottonseed oils, and similar oils, as well as acids not derived from drying oils and of a synthetic origin, with a carbon chain preferably of about 20 carbon atoms or less and having unsaturation therein which can be caused to air cure in a manner analogous to linseed oil. The preferred oils are those which contain oleic and linoleic acids or linoleic and linolenic acids as the predominant ones. The preparation of the fatty acid hydroxyamide is carried out by well known procedures as is the esterification of the carboxyl groups on the polymeric backbone by the hydroxyamide. Exemplary of publications describing these are The Journal of the American Oil Chemists Society, Volume 46, pages 355 364, published in 1969, which discloses the use of diethanolamine to produce fatty acid hydroxyamide rather than the monoethanolamine which is preferred in the present invention, German Pat.1,940,471, and Belgian Pat. 757,271 and U.S. Pat. 3,590,016, the latter to relating to hard coatings such as paints.The U.S. and Belgian patents are to the same type of polymer generally, although the products taught therein have several defects making them unsuitable for many uses nctiuding caulking or sealing compositions. For example, all of the backbone polymers disclosed are brittle or hard polymers. Thus, it appears that the softest polymer backbpne, of the patent examples, would be of styrene and or methacrylate that would have a glass transition temperature Tg of 100 C. or above. Polymers of this g hardness, at ambient temperatures, would be useless for caulks or sealants, even if extensively plasticized. The preparation of the fatty acid glycidyl ester is carried out by well known procedures as is the esterification of the carboxyl groups on the polymeric backbone.Exemplary of publications describing the preparation of a similar polymer is British Pat. No. 1,060,711. The glycidyl ester may be prepared in the manner taught byU.S. Pat. No. .3,366,706. The British patent is to the same type of polymer generally, although the products taught therein have several defects making them unsuitable for many uses including caulking or sealing compositions.For example, all of the backbone polymers disclosed are brittle or hard polymers. Thus, it appears that the softest polymer of the British patent is described inExample 6, and that would have a glass transition temperature Tg of about 70 C. The most serious disadvantage is a lack of any recognition of the importance of free carboxyl groups. Most of the examples utilize the glycidyl ester in molar excess over the carboxyl groups. Some examples, including Examples 2,5,6,7 and 13 have a very slight excess of carboxyl groups over epoxy groups reacted therewith, but there is advanced no reason therefor.Most importantly, the only two examples relating to the use of unsaturated glycidyl esters, Examples 14 and 15, teach directly away from the present invention in requiring that approximately a 100 percent molar excess of the glycidyl ester be utilized over that required to react with all of the carboxyl groups in the polymer. One of the most important disadvantages of this lack of acid groups is that such polymers would be quite deficient in adhesion to various substrates. When modifying the backbone polymer with the glycidyl ester of an unsaturated fatty acid it is essential that the preformed polymer backbone contains carboxyl groups for reaction therewith. The simultaneous polymerization of carboxyl containing monomers such as acrylic acid with glycidyl esters such as glycidyl methacrylate is impractical because they react and crosslink in situ.Also unsatisfactory is the scheme of forming polymer with glycidyl groups and then esterifying these with the unsaturated fatty acid. This again results in a lack of free carboxyl groups which has a number of disadvantages. It is also important to limit the number of ester groups, because for every esterified carboxyl, a hydroxyl group is formed. The more of these that are present the more likely the polymer is to be sensitive to water in vapor or liquid form. Any of the conventional driers may be included in the compositions, such as the linoleates, naphthenates, and resinates of cobalt, zirconium, manganese, lead, cerium, chromium, iron, nickel, uranium, and zinc are suitable. The amount of drier based on the weight of the glycidyl ester or hydroxy amide of formula I can be as low as 0.05 percent to as high as about 10 percent. Best results are obtained with combinations of driers, particularly zinc naphthenate and cobalt naphthenate in quite small amounts, for example, from 0.05 percent to 2.0 percent of te zinc naphthenate are particularly useful. The amount of drier utilized should be such as to promote oxidative cure and to minimize dirt pickup by the finished caulk. It is helpful, in some cases, to utilize a silane to improv t adhesion to glass by the caulk and also, at times, to utilize plasticizers for providing low temperature jexibillty, for example, at 150F. Suitable silanes include vinltriethoxysilane, y methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, ss 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethoxysilane, Y aminopropylbiethoxysilane, andN dimethoxymethylsilylisobutyl ethylenediamine. The silane concentration may be between about 0.05 percent and 0.5 percent. Higher amounts may be used but do not result in proportional improvements in adhesion.Suitable plasticizers include well known phthalate plasticizers, oil modified sebacic acid alkyds, unmodified sebacic acid alkyds, oil modified maleic polyesters, etc. It is preferr to use internal plasticization by means of soft monomers in the backbone. This provides a product which can be used with less solvent, thus minimizing shrinkage. The photosensitive compound is preferably a benzophenone derivative having the formulaEMI19.1 wherein R is H, 4 CH3,4 OH,4 NH2,4 Cl,4 COOH,4 COOCH3, 2 COOH,2 COOCH3,2 NH2,2 OH, 3 N02,3 COOH or3 COOCH3. More preferably the photosensitive compound is a para substituted benzophenone, especially where R is H, 4 CH3, 4 OH, 4 NH2, 4 C1, 4 COOH or 4 COOCH3. Benzophenone itself is most preferred for its availability and performance. The amount of photosensitive compound used in the invention is preferably from 0.01 to 12 by weight of polymer solids in the formulated product, more preferably from 0.01 to 3 , most preferably from 0.01 to 1 by weight. Although it is not fully understood, there appears to be a relationship. between the type of composition organic solvent based or water based and the optimum amount of photosensitive compound, such as benzophenone, to obtain surface cure. In solvent based sealants and mastics the amount of photosensitive compound is preferably from 0.01 to 10 by weight of polymer, more preferably from 0.01 to 1 , most preferably from 0.01 to 0.4 by weight. In aqueous caulks and mastics the amount of photosensitive compound is preferably from 0.01 to 12 by weight of polymer, more preferably from 0.01 to 3 , most preferably from 0.01 to 1 by weight. The compositions of the invention may be exposed to any form of actinic radiation. Of course, outdoor exposure is the most convenient source of radiation but in addition or alternatively any of the well known artificial sources of actinic radiation may be used. In a further embodiment of the invention there is provided a method of reducing the surface tack of a mastic, caulking, sealant or adhesive composition which comprises a from 10 to 90 by weight, solids basis, of a binder comprising an addition polymer and b from 90 to 10 by weight, solids basis, of one or more of the following additives an emulsifier, a dispersant, an organic solvent, a base, a pigment, a filler, a dye, a defoamer, a thickener, a polyvalent metal containing complex or salt as a drier, an adhesion promoter, and a plasticizer which method comprises providing in the composition a photosensitive compound and exposing the composition to actinic radiation. The composition used may be any of those described herein. Some preferred embodiments of the invention will now be more particularly described in and by the following examples, in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specifically noted.Preparation of Samples The addition of a photosensitizer to either a binder or formulated product is generally performed by post addition of a concentrated solution of a photosensitizer in one or more of the following solvents xylene, ethanol, methyl ethyl ketone or N,N dimethylformamide. The choice of solvent is governed by the solubility of the photosensitizer and subsequent compatibility with the polymer binder or formulated product. Alternatively, the photosensitizer may be directly added to the polymer or during the preparation of a sealant, mastic, glazing, patching or adhesive product. Various test methods for evaluating caulking and sealant compositions are described in Resin Revue 1966, Vol. XVl no. 3, published by Rohm and Haas Co., which is incorporated herein hy reference.Method of Evaluation After additlcn of the photosensitizer to the polymer binder or formulated product the resultant material is skived, tooled, brushed or poured into slabs which are subsequently placed under exterior exposure cure conditions. A duplicate set of samples is generally retained in the laboratory as a control. If the material is a formulated sealant, it is generally evaluated via the tack free time test described in Federal SpecificationTTS 00230C section 4.3.6. . This is a Pass Fail test and as such, has limited utility. The relative surface tack of the material under study is evaluated by touch rating the surface of the material in question. Samples are evaluated versus a control and rated as P poor,F fair, G good, or E excellent.Relative tack free time and mildew growth, together, are evaluated versus a control and rated according to the scale 0 poor to 10 excellent. Sealant gunnability extrusion rate is also run as described in Federal SpecificationTTS 00230C section 4.3.3. .4.3.6 Tack free time.
