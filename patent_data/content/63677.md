# Self locking fastener and tool for making same.

## Abstract
A self locking fastener includes a male member, such as a bolt and a female member, such as a nut. The female threads of the nut are defined by leading and trailing flanks which converge to provide a truncated root that frictionally engages and deforms a portion of the male crest. The trailing flanks of the male and female threads are inclined at the same angle and frictionally engage each other throughout their entire depth. The leading flanks of the male and female threads diverge away from each other to provide a space adjacent the truncated female root for receiving the deformed portion of the male crest therewithin, which produces with the full engagement of the trailing flanks firm metal tometal contact between the members throughout the entire length of the female thread, thereby procluding lateral movement of one member relative to the other.
