# HIGH POWERED OVER VOLTAGE PROTECTION

## Abstract
The overload protection material of this invention com prises a plastic preferably an elastomer, e.g. silicone rubber, homogeneously and highly loaded with silicon carbide particles powder and a lesser amount of a Group IV B element carbide particles powder . The material is prefer ably form stable and is placed across a semiconductor junction or between electrodes of a device to be protected so that when high voltage surges appear across the junction or device to be protected the material breaks down conducts before the junction or device is destroyed. The material is bidirectionally conductive in its voltage threshold character istic and repeatedly recovers unlike a fuse so that it provides continuous high voltage over voltage e.g. surge protection.
