# MAGNETIC HEAD

## Abstract
A magnetic head includes ferromagnetic amorphous alloy multi layer films 16 each composed of an alternate lamination of ferromagnetic amorphous alloy layers 19 and magnetic spacer layers 20 . The thickness of each ferromagnetic amorphous alloy layer 19 is of 1 µm to 10 µm. The thickness of each magnetic spacer layer 20 is of 0.01 µm to 0.2 µm. The ferromagnetic amorphous alloy multi layer films 16 constitute at least parts of the head core.
