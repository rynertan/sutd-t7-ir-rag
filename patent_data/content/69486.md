## Abstract
A flare tip has an inner tube 3 having an inlet and outlet for an air supply and an outer co axial tube 2 spaced apart from the inner tube 3 to form an annular gap 4 . The annular gap 4 has an inlet 5 for a fuel gas supply and the upper part of the inner tube 3 has a plurality of channels 7 . The channels 7 are shaped to encourage upward and inward flow of fuel gas so as to mix with air issuing from the outlet of the inner tube 3 .
