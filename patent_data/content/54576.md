## Description
Process for Producing Esters from Olefins This invention relates to a process for the continuous production of organic esters by the reaction of carboxylic acids with olefins in the presence of a cationic exchange resin type of catalyst.More particularly, this invention relates to a process for reacting lower carboxylic acids, especially acetic acid or propionic acid, with lower olefins, especially propylene or butylene, in a fixed bed tubular flow reactor in which the acid in the liquid state is continuously contacted with the olefin, which is present as a gas. The solid catalyst used is an ion exchange resin, preferably in its acid orm. The production of esters by means of the reaction of a carboxylic acid with an olefin in the presence of a strong acid as catalyst has been known for several years. Over the last few years a number of catalysts have been used, usually strong mineral acids such as sulphuric acid, perchloric acid, or even less strong acids such as phosphoric acid, all of which act by themselves as homogeneous catalysts or else as supported heterogeneous catalysts on inert materials. For example, from US patent 2,740,800 there is known a process which comprises continuously feeding acetic acid and propylene into a bath of approximately the following composition in percent by weight 20 30 sulphuric acid, 5 30 acetic acid, 5 10 isopropyl acetate , 0.5 10 water and 20 69.5 isopropyl hydrogen sulphate, maintaining said bath at a temperature of about 60 800C, the rate of feed of said propylene being about 2 5 cubic metres per hour of propylene per kg. of said bath, the rate of feed of said acetic acid being sufficient to maintain the bath content thereof within the above mentioned percentage range, and removing isopropyl acetate from the bath by gas containing propylene at substantially the rate at which the isopropyl acetate is formed in the bath.There is further known from DE OS 25 11 978 a process for preparing carboxylic acid esters of the formula IEMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same or different and each mean an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, araliphatic or aromatic group or a hydrogen atom, R3 designates a hydrogen atom or R3 and R2 stand for members of an alicyclic ring, by reacting carboxylic acids with olefins in the presence of phosphoric acid as catalyst, characterised by reacting carboxylic acids of the formula IIEMI2.2 wherein R1 has the meaning given above, with olefines of the formula IIIEMI2.3 wherein R2 has the meaning given above, at a temperature of 141 to 3500C in the presence of a catalyst containing silicium dioxide and phosphoric acid in an amount of 10 to 70 percent by weight phosphoric acid, based on the total amount of catalyst, and in the presence of phosphoric acid and or one or more phosphoric acid esters as auxiliary catalysts.From EP Al 0 003 206 there is known.a process for the preparation of ethyl or isopropyl esters by reaction in liquid phase of ethylene or propylene, under pressure, with a carboxylic acid, characterised in that the reaction is carried out in the presence of an effective amount of at least one acid of the formula C F SO 3H n 1 in which n is an integer which can be zero and which has at most the value 8, as a catalyst.Direct esterification of organic acids with olefins in the presence of strong acids in the homogeneous phase as catalysts according to the above mentioned prior art presents the drawback that the resulting esterification product has to be separated from the catalyst in a laborious and uneconomical fashion. If, for example, sulphuric acid is used as the catalyst, it can be washed out of the organic reaction products with water. It is, however, uneconomical to recover the sulphuric acid by concentration.It is likewise uneconomical to discard the sulphuric acid since it contains part of the organic acid used.In addition to the use of various acids as catalyst in the homogeneous phase which has already been mentioned, there are also known methods in which ion exchange resins are used as catalysts. US patent 2,678,332 describes a process for the esterification of olefins with organic acids in which ion exchange resins are used as catalysts. After the esterification reaction is complete, the ester acetic acid mixture can be directly decanted from the solid resin particles or filtered from them and thereafter worked up in the usual way with a convenient method for the recovery of unreacted acetic acid or other watersoluble organic material present in the reaction products.According to the process known from US patent 2,678,332, however, the reaction between the carboxylic acid and the olefin is carried out in the liguid phase. In order to ensure that the reaction partners are sufficiently well mixed the ingredients have to be vigorously stirred.When an olefin is used which is gaseous at the reaction temperature, sufficient pressure must be exerted on the reactor to maintain the olefin in a liquid phase at the operating temperature. Such pressures range from slightly above atmospheric pressure up to about 55 atmospheres.The chief purpose for the use of such elevated pressures is to maintain the olefin as well as any other low boiling reactants in the liquid phase.It can be stated that these conventional reacti√≥nssystems are constituted by two phases the catalyst solid phase and the olefin carboxylic acid mixture liquid phase. In order to keep the olefin in the liquid form, when dealing with gas olefins under the temperature conditions required by the reaction very high pressures are needed which are badly tolerated by the catalyst packing. The consequence is a drastic reduction in the catalyst life. Furthermore, the reactions are carried out using vertical tubular flow reactors, where the pressurized liquid olefin is fed through the top of the reactor after being mixed up with the liquid carboxylic acid and comes into contact with the solid catalyst packed bed while flowing downwards through it. This can lead to a poor stirring effect.Good stirring is a rate determining factor and consequently the yield determining factor of the process. As a consequence of these facts the ester yields in the process known from US patent 2,678,332 are very low.It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for the continuous production of carboxylic acid esters which overcomes the disadvantages of theprior processes. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a simple and efficient process for the continuous production of carboxylic acid esters in a high yield.It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a process for the continuous production of carboxylic acid esters in a very high selectivity.These and other objects of the present invention will become evident from the following description and the accompanying drawings.The invention accordingly comprises a process for the continuous production of carboxylic acid esters having the general chemical formula IEMI5.1 wherein R is a methyl or ethyl group, by direct reaction of either acetic or propionic acid with either propylene or butylenes in the presence of a cation exchange resin in its acid form as catalyst, characterised in that the reaction is carried out while the olefin is in a gaseous state. The reaction between the carboxylic acid and the olefin is preferably carried out at a pressure which is not, however, sufficient to liquefy the oleo in at the given reaction temperature.In contrast to the known processes, where the olefin is liquefied due to pressure and the reaction mixture therefore only consists of two phases solid catalyst and liquid reaction mixture , the reaction system according to the present invention is a three phase chemical system.The olefin is fed and flows through the reactor as a gas and becomes dissolved into the liquid carboxylic acid feed to the extent required by the reaction. Thereby the contact between the liquid olef in carboxylic acid solution and the solid catalyst bed particles is improved by the stirring effect of the gaseous olefin flow.A three phase reaction system of this type, with a stationary solid catalyst phase and a mobile liquid and mobile gaseous phase is normally operated in countercurrent. Thereby the gas is fed through the bottom of the vertical tubular reactor and as it flows upwards gets into countercurrent contact with the downward flowing liquid acid. In this technique there is, however, a danger that the catalyst bed may not always be completely covered by the liquid phase. Locally gas bubbles and flow discontinuities can form, which are undesirable for a good contact between the gas liquid reactants and the catalyst.These phenomena will also be detrimental to the activity selectivity and life of thecatalyst. Surprisingly it was found that in the continuous production of carboxylic acid esters according to the process of the present invention particularly good results are obtained as regards yield and selectivity when gas and liquid are fed concurrently through the bottom of the vertical tubular reactor. This way of feeding the liquid and the gaseous reaction partners is quite atypical for reactions in a three phase system, sinceas a rule reactions of this type are carried out in countercurrent. A person skilled in the art could not, therefore, expect that in the process according to the invention the unconventional technique used would lead to especially good results.In the case of the inventive manner of feeding the liquid and gaseous reaction partners in direct current, the whole catalyst bed is kept flooded with the liquid carboxylic acid from the start of the reaction. Contact of the gas bubbles and catalyst particles is thus occasional and kept to a minimum in space and time throughout the reactor.On the other hand, the liquid flow regime through the catalyst particles is made turbulent by the stirring effect of the gas flow. In the present process pressure levels of 6 to 12 atm. preferably 8 atm. are enough to make the contact of propylene and acetic acid with the active surface of the catalyst highly efficient and to ensure that propylene concentration in the liquid phase and in the liquid solid chemically active catalyst interphase is high enough. These pressure levels are quite different from those which would be required for a conventional liquid phase system in order to keep the olefin in liquid form.For example, 40 atmospheres are needed for propylene at 850C.In comparison to the known processes, the process of this invention offers the following advantages A Thanks to the defined conditions of the introduction of carboxylic acid and olefin in direct current from the bottom of reactor it is ensured that the catalyst is always flooded with liquid and that no sizeable gas bubbles form which could lead to partial dessication of the catalyst. The result is a high ester yield. B As compared to liquid homogeneous catalysts, the use of a solid heterogeneous catalyst means easier separation from the reactants and considerably less corrosion effects.C The need to completely separate the reactants from the catalyst no longer presents a problem. When mineral acids are used as catalysts, such separation has to be brought about by water washing or by distillation. Recovery of the acids by concentrating the wash water is not economical and it is not easy to treat them as effluents in view of the large amounts of acetic acid which are carried along. These drawbacks are clearly overcome by the use of cation exchange resins in their acid form as catalysts, since reactants flow through the catalyst bed and out of it without dragging along any of the active catalyst ingredients. The reaction product can be transferred directly to the purification stage, where the unreacted carboxylic acid is separated and recycled.D The process of the present invention, which is based on the three phase reaction system and the use of exchange resins as catalysts, allows for reaction temperatures which are lower than those required in the esterification processes of organic acids with olefins in the vapour phase on supported acid catalysts. This produces a definite advantage in that by product formation due to higher temperature levels is reduced considerably, which is equivalent to an increase in process selectivity.Catalysts suitable for use in the process of this invention are cationic exchange resins, particularly strop acid cationic exchangers such as those of the sulfonic acid type which are, for example,commerciaLly available under the Amberlite or Levatite trademarks. Preferred are cationic exchange resins whose basic structure consists of a styrene divinylbenzene macroporous copolymer. Experiments have been made with resins having a variable divinylbenzene content of between 8 and 18 , with particle sizes in the range of 0.3 to 1.5 mm and a water content ranging from 0.6 to 0.9 . The most favourable results have been obtained with those resins in which the divinylbenzene content is closer to 8 . At higher divinylbenzene contents the elasticity of the particles is diminished and the osmotic shock makes fragmentation easier.The ion exchange capacities of the catalysts, as measured by acid base titration, oscillate between 4.0 and 5.5 H meq g of dry resin.Before starting the reaction process it is necessary to submit the catalyst to a dehydration treatment followed by an immersion treatment. The latter is carried out by keeping the catalyst bed submerged in a solvent similar to the reaction medium for example acetic acid √≤r a period of time long enough to achieve the optimum swelling point. The dehydration pretreatment of the catalyst ion exchange resin is conducted at a temperature of at least 100 C, preferably between 105 and 1150C, for at least ten hours, preferably at least twenty hours, until a residual humidity value of 0.6 to 0.9 and a dry resin density value of 0.86 to 0.87 g ml are obtained. After the dehydration treatment the dry resins are immersed with the carboxylic acid which it is intended to react with the olefin up to an absorption value of at least 0.80, preferably at least 0.90 g of acid per g of selected dry resin.The reactants are continuously fed to the reactor in an olefin to acid molar ratio of at least 1 1, as it is convenient to have an excess of olefin at all times.The preferred molar ratio of olefin to acid is in the range of from 1 I 1 to 2.5 1. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of the acetic acid flow is in the range of from 2.2 to 1.0 h preferably of from 2.0 to 1.5 h The flows are to be kept as constant as possible during the process in order to maintain good isothermicity in all parts of the catalytic reactor.Bearing in mind what has been stated above in connection with the adequate pressure for a three phase reaction system, pressure should be the highest compatible with these limitations because it must have the favourable effect to be expected from gas liquid addition reactions.Pressures from atmospheric to 20 kgZcm2 have been used.The best results are obtained within the 6 to 12 kg cm2 interval.The exothermic heat of reaction makes good temperature control necessary. This control is made easier in the process of this invention by the fact that the tubular packed bed catalytic reactor is flooded all the time with the liquid flow of reactants. This results in more uniform heat distribution inside the reactor, to which the turbulence brought about by the gas flow is also a contributory factor.The reaction has been carried out in the particular system of the invention over a wide range of temperatures. The most favourable results are obtained at temperatures between 70 and 1150C. The preferred temperature range is from 90 to 1100C. Higher temperatures than these increase the production of undesirable by products such as propylene polymers to a very large extent. The result of this is not only the reduction of the reaction yield, but also the gradual deposition of these products on the catalyst surface, thereby reducing catalyst activity.The process of the invention is illustrated further with the aid of the attached drawing.In the drawing 1 means a feed tank for the olefin and 2 a feed tank for the carboxylic acid.After dehydration and impregnation with the carboxylic acid the catalyst is charged into the multitubular reactor 3 .The catalyst bed thus obtained is now flooded with the liquid carboxylic acid, taking care to ensure that the catalyst is fully covered. At the same time heating is begun.When this operation is completed propylene can already be fed, which in turn serves to pressurize the reactor.The reaction is started and the reaction heat produced will help considerably to maintain an adequate thermal reaction level.When the desired pressure is attained in the circuit, back pressure valves regulate the outlets of the liquid vapor sesarater 4 where excess propylene gas expands to atmospheric pressure, thus being separated from the organic liquid phase. This propylene is compressed and recycled to the feed tank 1 .The liquid phase is fed to the middle zone of the distillation tower 5 . Here the light fraction is continuously separated.The other fraction goes to a second tower 6 from the top of which pure isopropyl acetate is obtained. The residue from this tower is circulated to a third distillation tower 7 which effects the separation of unreacted acetic acid, which is recycled back to the feed tank 2 , from the residual heavier by products.The following examples are intended to illustrate but in no way limit the scope of the present invention.Example 1 17 g of ion exchange resin Lewatit SPC, with sulphonic acid groups, previously dehydrated at a temperature of 1100C for 25 hours and immersed in acetic acid until an absorption value of 0.95 g of acid per g of dry resin is reached are placed in a vertical stainless steel tube with a height of 50 cm and a diameter of 1.09 cm provided with a steam jacket and designed to withstand pressure. The catalyst bed is thus provided with an apparent volume of 42.9 cm3 volume occupied by the packed bed .The reactor is flooded with liquid acetic acid flowing at 68 g h and a LSHV of 1.75 h 1. Finally 76.3 g l of propylene gas at a pressure of 8 kg cm2 and a temperature of 950C are continuously fed through.After operating the system for 8 hours the reaction product collected was analysed with the following result Acetic acid conversion 71. 8 Propylene conversion 46.3 Isopropyl acetate selectivity 96.5 Example 2The reaction system of the preceding example was operated continuously for 136 hours, using the same temperature and pressure conditions. Propylene and acetic acid were continuously fed ina molar ratio of 2.1 1. Catalyst activity and selectivity remained constant during the whole period. The results were as follows Acetic acid conversion 70 Propylene conversion 34 Isopropyl acetate selectivity 97 Example 3In order to check further the effect of the reactant flows and temperature on the activity, selectivity and life of the catalyst, the test of the preceding example was continued, feeding 67 g h of acetic acid and a LSHV of 1.7 h and 95 g h of propylene continuously over 160 hours. The reactor pressure was 8 kgZcm2 and the temperature was kept steady at 1080C. Once again conversion and selectivity remained constant during the whole time, with the following values. Acetic acid conversion 87 Propylene conversion 44 Isopropyl acetate selectivity 97
