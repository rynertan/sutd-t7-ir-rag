# MOBILE MACHINE FOR STRAIGHTENING TUBES

## Abstract
A mobile scaffold straightening machine comprising a chassis 1 and four road wheels 2, 3. A prime mover 7 is mounted on the chassis and drives a hydraulic pump 11. Fluid from the pump can be directed via a hydraulic circuit to a plurality of hydraulic drive motors for driving respective rollers 34 37 through which scaffold or similar tubes may be fed for straightening. The straightening rollers are waisted and their axes are inclined to the path of the tube being bent in such a manner that the line of contact of the tube is a tangent to the centre of the curved surface of each roller.
