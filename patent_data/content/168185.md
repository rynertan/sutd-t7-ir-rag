# Improving zeolite catalyst life.

## Abstract
The catalyst life of zeolites useful in the conversion to olefins of alcohols e.g. methanol and or their ether derivatives e.g. dimethyl ether is improved by modifying the zeolite in a 2 stage procedure by providing a controlled low amount of a coke precursor deposit on the external surface of the zeolite, and then heating this treated zeolite in an inert gas at specifically controlled temperatures for a minimum time.
