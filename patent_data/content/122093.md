# Adaptive apparatus and method for control.

## Abstract
An improved control apparatus and method for servo sys tem control is disclosed wherein a generally increasing or de creasing control signal is supplied to a source of energy when a desired parameter of interest produced by said source of en ergy is not equal to a desired value, and a constant control sig nal when the parameter of interest does equal the desired value. The constant control signal is determined by the previ ous constand control signal plus the product of the difference between the peak value of the generally increasing or decreas ing control signal and the previous constant control signal multiplied by a constant.
