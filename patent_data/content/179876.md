## Description
The present invention relates to new molecular sieve compositions containing titanium, aluminum and silicon in the form of framework tetrahedral oxide units. These compositions are prepared hydrothermally from reaction mixtures containing reactive sources of titanium, aluminum and silicon and preferably at least one organic templating agent. Molecular sieves having crystalline structures and of the aluminosilicate type are well known to those familiar with molecular sieve technology. Both naturally occurring and synthetic aluminosilicates are known to exist and literally hundreds of such have been reported in the literature. Although hundreds of aluminosilicates binary molecular sieves are known, the reports relating to ternary molecular sieves have been relatively few. Further, the reported ternary molecular sieves having titanium as a component have been even fewer and in those instances where titanium has been reported the amount contained in the molecular sieve has been relatively small or present as a deposition or surface modifying agent. One early report of crystalline titano silicate zeolites Of course, these compositions are not zeolites as the term zeolite is commonly employed today. is found in U.S. Patent No. 3,329,481. The crystalline titano silicates are described in U.S. Patent No. 3,329,481 by the formula The difficulty in obtaining compositions containing titanium is evidenced by the disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 4,358,397 which discloses modified aluminosilicates. The aluminosilicates are modified by treating an aluminosilicate with a compound derived from one or more elements of titanium, zirconium or hafnium. The resulting compositions are said to contain a minor proportion of an oxide of such elements. It is clear that in the disclosed compositions the oxides of titanuim, zirconium and hafnium were present as deposited oxides and were present in a minor proportion. As above mentioned, although there has been an extensive treatment in the patent art and in the published literature of aluminosilicates and recently, aluminophosphates, there has been little information available on the presence of other than such materials. This is particularly true in the area of titanium containing compositions. Molecular sieve compositions wherein titanium is present in the framework of the molecular sieve or is so intimately related as to change the physical and or chemical characteristics of the molecular sieve have not been extensively reported. This is understandable in the question of aluminosilicates, as indicated by the article. Can Ti⁴ replace Si⁴ in silicates , Mineralogical Magazine, September vol 37, No. 287, pages 366 369 1969 . In this article it is concluded that substitution of framework silicon by titanium does not usually occur in aluminosilicates owing to the preference of titanium to be octahedrally bound rather than tetrahedrally bound. Even for the formation of crystalline titanosilicate zeolites , as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,329,481 and discussed above, wherein a metallo silicate complex is formed and treated to give the titanosilicate product, the evidence for the claimed titanosilicate is based on the X ray powder diffraction pattern data which are somewhat suspect as to whether such show substitution of titanium into the silicate framework inasmuch as the same claimed X ray patterns are also observed for the zirconium silicates. Further, similar X ray patterns showing similar interplanar distances for the two values in pattern B have been reported for silicalite. see GB A 2,071,071 . The incorporation of titanium in a silicalite type structure is disclosed in GB A 2,071,071, published December 21, 1979. The amount of titanium claimed to be substituted into the silicalite type structure is very small, being no more than 0.04 mole percent, based on the number of moles of silica, and may be as low as 0.0005. The titanium content was determined by chemical analysis and was not determined to be greater than 0.023 in any of the reported examples. As indicated by a comparison of Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b of GB A 2,071,071, the amount of titanium present is so small and no significant change in the X ray diffraction pattern of silicalite was observed and the minor changes observed may simply be due to occluded titanium dioxide. Thus, in the absence of other analytical data the results are not well defined. No comparison data for titanium dioxide are disclosed. In view of the above, it is clear that the substitution of titanium into a zeolitic type framework although conceived to be possible wherein titanium substitutes for silicon, has been deemed most difficult to achieve. The difficulty which is met in preparing titanium containing molecular sieve compositions is further demonstrated by the failure of European Patent Application EP A 77,522, published April 27 1983, entitled Titanium containing zeolites and method for their production as well as use of said zeolites. , to actually prepare titanium containing molecular sieve compositions. Although the applicants claim the preparation of titano aluminosilicates having the pentasil structure, it is evident from an analysis of the products of the examples that titanium was not present in the form of a framework tetrahederal oxide in a molecular sieve having the pentasil structure. The products of the examples of EP A 77 522 will be discussed in detail in a comparative example hereinafter. EP A 77 522 describes the preparation of a product using conventional zeolite synthesis methods and material including sodium aluminate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, silica gel and titanium tetrachloride. Titanium tetrachloride however hydrolyses rapidly in the reaction mixture thereby generating large particles of TiO₂ which precipitates out from the reaction mixture so that titanium is not incorporated in the crystal lattice. The present invention relates to titanium aluminum silicon oxide molecular sieves having three dimensional microporous crystal framework structures of TiO₂, AlO₂ and SiO₂ tetrahedral units TASO which have a unit empirical formula on an anhydrous basis of The molecular sieves of the present invention are generally employable as catalysts for various hydrocarbon conversion processes. The individual class members or species will be identified by denominating the various structural species which make up the TASO family by assigning a number to the species and, accordingly, are identified as TASO i where the number i is an integer. This designation is an arbitrary one and is not intented to denote structural relations to another material s which may also be characterized by a numbering system. The term unit empirical formula is used herein according to its common meaning to designate the simplest formula which gives the relative number of moles of titanium, aluminum and silicon which form the TiO₂, AlO₂ and SiO₂ tetrahedral unit within a titanium aluminum silicon oxide molecular sieve and which forms the molecular framework of the TASO composition s . The unit empirical formula is given in terms of titanium, aluminum and silicon as shown in Formula 1 , above, and does not include other compounds, cations or anions which may be present as a result of the preparation or the existence of other impurities or materials in the bulk composition not containing the aforementioned tetrahedral unit. The amount of template R is reported as part of the composition when the as synthesized unit empirical formula is given, and water may also be reported unless such is defined as the anhydrous form. For convenience, coefficient m for template R is reported as a value that is normalized by dividing the number of moles of organic by the total moles of titanium, aluminum and silicon. The unit empirical formula for a given TASO can be calculated using the chemical analysis data for that TASO. Thus, for example, in the preparation of TASOs disclosed hereinafter the over all composition of the as synthesized TASO is calculated using the chemical analysis data and expressed in terms of molar oxide ratios on an anhydrous basis. The unit empirical formula for a TASO may be given on an as synthesized basis or may be given after an as synthesized TASO composition has been subjected to some post treatment process, e.g., calcination. The term as synthesized herein shall be used to refer to the TASO composition s formed as a result of the hydrothermal crystallization but before the TASO composition has been subjected to post treatment to remove any volatile components present therein. The actual value of m for a post treated TASO will depend on several factors including the particular TASO, template, severity of the post treatment in terms of its ability to remove the template from the TASO, the proposed application of the TASO composition, and etc. and the value for m can be within the range of values as defined for the as synthesized TASO compositions although such is generally less than the as synthesized TASO unless such post treatment process adds template to the TASO so treated. A TASO composition which is in the calcined or other post treatment form generally has an empirical formula represented by Formula 1 , except that the value of m is generally less than about 0.02. Under sufficiently severe post treatment conditions, e.g. roasting in air at high temperature for long periods over 1 hr. , the value of m may be zero 0 or, in any event, the template, R, is undetectable by normal analytical procedures. The molecular sieves of the instant invention are generally synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization from a reaction mixture comprising reactive sources of titanium, aluminum and silicon, and preferably one or more organic templating agents. Optionally, alkali metal s may be present in the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is placed in a pressure vessel, preferably lined with an inert plastic material, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, and heated, preferably under the autogenous pressure, at a temperature of from about 50 C to about 250 C, until crystals of the molecular sieve product are obtained, usually for a period of from 2 hours to 2 weeks or more. While not essential to the synthesis of the instant molecular sieves, it has been found that in general stirring or other moderate agitation of the reaction mixture and or seeding the reaction mixture with seed crystals of either the TASO to be produced, or a topologically similar composition, facilitates the crystallization procedure. The product is recovered by any convenient method such as centrifugation or filtration. After crystallization the TASO may be isolated and washed with water and dried in air. As a result of the hydrothermal crystallization, the as synthesized TASO contains within its intracrystalline pore system at least one form of any template employed in its formation. Generally, the template is a molecular species, but it is possible, steric considerations permitting, that at least some of the template is present as a charge balancing cation. Generally the template is too large to move freely through the intracrystalline pore system of the formed TASO and may be removed by a post treatment process, such as by calcining the TASO at temperatures of between about 200 C and to about 700 C so as to thermally degrade the template or by employing some other post treatment process for removal of at least part of the template from the TASO. In some instances the pores of the TASO are sufficiently large to permit transport of the template, and, accordingly, complete or partial removal thereof can be accomplished by conventional desorption procedures such as carried out in the case of zeolites. The TASO compositions are generally formed from a reaction mixture containing reactive sources of TiO₂, Al₂O₃, and SiO₂ and an organic templating agent, said reaction mixture comprising a composition expressed in terms of molar oxide ratios of The reaction mixture from which these TASOs are formed generally contain one or more organic templating agents templates which can be most any of those heretofore proposed for use in the synthesis of aluminosilicates and aluminophosphates. The template preferably contains at least one element of Group VA of the Periodic Table, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and or antimony, more preferably nitrogen or phosphorus and most preferably nitrogen and are of the formula R₄X wherein X is selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and or antimony and R may be hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, araalkyl, or alkylaryl group and is preferably aryl or alkyl containing between 1 and 8 carbon atoms, although more than eight carbon atoms may be present in R groups of the template. Nitrogen containing templates are preferred, including amines and quaternary ammonium compounds, the latter being represented generally by the formula R ₄N wherein each R is an alkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, or araalkyl group wherein R preferably contains from 1 to 8 carbon atoms or higher when R is alkyl and greater than 6 carbon atoms when R is otherwise, as hereinbefore discussed. Polymeric quaternary ammonium salts such as C₁₄H₃₂N₂ OH ₂ Representative templates which may be employed herein include tetramethylammonium tetraethylammonium tetrapropylammonium tetrabutylammonium ions di n propylamine tripropylamine triethylamine triethanolamine piperidine cyclohexylamine 2 methylpyridine N,N dimethylbenzylamine N,N diethylethanolamine dicyclohexylamine N,N dimethylethanolamine 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane N methyldiethanolamine, N methyl ethanolamine N methylcyclohexylamine 3 methyl pyridine 4 methylpyridine quinuclidine N,N dimethyl 1,4 diazabicyclo 2,2,2 octane ion di n butylamine, neopentylamine di n pentylamine isopropylamine t butylamine ethylenediamine pyrrolidine and 2 imidazolidone. As will be readily apparent from the illustrative examples set forth hereinafter, not every template will produce every TASO composition although a single template can, with proper selection of the reaction conditions, cause the formation of different TASO compositions, and a given TASO composition can be produced using different templates. In those instances where an alkoxide is the reactive titanium, aluminum and or silicon source, the corresponding alcohol is necessarily present in the reaction mixture since it is a hydrolysis product of the alkoxide. It has not as yet been determined whether this alcohol participates in the synthesis process as a templating agent, or in some other function and, accordingly, is not reported as a template in the unit formula of the TASOs, although such may be acting as templates. Alkali metal cations when present in the reaction mixture may facilitate the crystallization of certain TASO phases, although the exact function of such cations in crystallization, if any, is not presently known. Alkali cations present in the reaction mixture generally appear in the formed TASO composition, either as occluded extraneous cations and or as structural cations balancing net negative charges at various sites in the crystal lattice. It should be understood that although the unit formula for the TASOs does not specifically recite the presence of alkali cations they are not excluded in the same sense that hydrogen cations and or hydroxyl groups are not specifically provided for in the traditional formulae for zeolitic aluminosilicates. The reactive titanium sources are selected from titanium alkoxides, water soluble titanates, and titanium chelates. Most any reactive source of silicon can be employed herein. The preferred reactive sources of silicon are silica, either as a silica sol or as fumed silica, a reactive solid amorphous precipitated silica, silica gel, alkoxides of silicon, silicic acid or alkali metal silicate and mixtures thereof. Most any reactive aluminum source may be employed herein. The preferred reactive aluminum sources include sodium aluminate, aluminum alkoxides, such as aluminum isopropoxide, and pseudoboehmite. Crystalline or amorphous aluminosilicates which are a suitable source of silicon are, of course, also suitable sources of aluminum. Other sources of aluminum used in zeolite synthesis, such as gibbsite and aluminum trichloride may be employed but are generally not deemed preferred. The X ray patterns carried out herein and all other X ray patterns appearing herein were obtained using either 1 standard x ray powder diffraction techniques or 2 by use of using copper K alpha radiation with computer based techniques using Siemens D 500 X ray powder diffractometers, Siemens Type K 805 X ray sources, available from Siemens Corporation, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, with appropriate computer interface. When employing the standard X ray technique the radiation source is a high intensity, copper target, X ray tube operated at 50kV and 40 mA. The diffraction pattern from the copper K alpha radiation and graphite monochromator is suitably recorded by an X ray spectrometer scintillation counter, pulse height analyzer and strip chart recorder. Flat compressed powder samples are scanned at 2 2 theta per minute, using a two second time constant. Interplanar spacings d in nm Angstrom units are obtained from the position of the diffraction peaks expressed as 2ϑ theta where theta is the Bragg angle as observed on the strip chart. Intensities are determined from the heights of diffraction peaks after subtracting background. I As will be understood by those skilled in the art the determination of the parameter 2 theta is subject to both human and mechanical error, which in combination, can impose an uncertainty of about 0.4 on each reported value of 2 theta. This uncertainty is, of course, also manifested in the reported values of the d spacings, which are calculated from the 2 theta values. This imprecision is general throughout the art and is not sufficient to preclude the differentiation of the present crystalline materials from each other and from the compositions of the prior art.

FIG. 2 is a ternary diagram wherein parameters relating to the reaction mixtures employed in the preparation of the compositions of this invention are set forth as mole fractions. FIG. 3 is an SEM Scanning Electron Micrograph of the product of European Application EP A 77 522. The following examples are provided to exemplify the invention and are not meant to be limiting thereof in any way. The method of addition of the above mentioned components to the reaction mixture was done according to three methods A, B and C . Methods A, B and C are as follows Sodium hydroxide and approximately one third of the water were blended to form a homogeneous mixture. Sodium aluminate was dissolved in this mixture and blended. LUDOX LS was added to this mixture and the mixture blended. Titanium isopropoxide was blended into this mixture after which the organic templating agent in approximately two thirds of the water was added to this mixture and blended until a homogeneous mixture was observed. LUDOX LS and titanium isopropoxide were blended to form a mixture. Sodium hydroxide was added to approximately one half the water and then mixed with the sodium aluminate with the resulting mixture being blended until a homogeneous mixture was observed. The organic template was added to one half the water and then added to the above mixture. The resulting mixture was blended until a homogeneous mixture was observed. LUDOX LS and one third of the water were blended to form a homogeneous mixture. Titanium isopropoxide was added to this mixture and blended to form a homogeneous mixture. Sodium aluminate was dissolved in one sixth of the water and blended with the above mixture. Sodium hydroxide was dissolved in one sixth of the water and added to the above mixture and blended to provide a homogeneous mixture. The organic template in one third of the water was added and the mixture again blended until a homogeneous mixture was observed. The preparative examples are identified by molar amounts of components by The TASO 48 product from example 7 was calcined and treated as hereinafter described and were then employed to determine adsorption capacities of TASO. The adsorption capacities were measured using a standard McBain Bakr gravimetric adsorption apparatus on samples activated in a vacuum at 350 C. The data for TASO 48, as prepared in examples 7 was as follows The above chemical analysis gives an anhydrous formula of The above chemical analysis gives an anhydrous formula of This is a comparative example wherein example 1 of European Patent Application No. 82109451.3 was repeated and the product evaluated by several techniques as hereinafter discussed The four morphologies of the two samples prepared in accordance with the European application and the EDAX microprobe analysis for each was as follows The above SEM and EDAX data demonstrate that although ZSM 5 type crystals were formed that these crystals contained no detectable titanium. The only detectable titanium was present as impurity phases and not in crystals having the ZSM 5 structure. The X ray diffraction patterns of the as synthesized materials were obtained and the following X ray patterns were observed Table VI and VII shows an X ray pattern typical of a ZSM 5 type product and can be attributed to the smooth, integrown hexagonal particles which contained no titanium. The X ray patterns of Tables VI and VII show three peaks 2ϑ 5.6 5.8, 12.45 12.54 and 24.5 24.72 which could not be explained. The two samples were calcined according to the conditions set forth in the European application with a portion of both samples being calcined at 540 C for sixteen hours. The X ray patterns of the calcined samples were as follows. The X ray diffraction pattern of the calcined samples shown a ZSM 5 type pattern with only slight differences from the as synthesized. When chemical analysis bulk of a portion of the calcined samples 1 and 2 are carried out the following is obtained When the molar ratio of oxides is computed for the above bulk analysis the following is obtained The TASO compositions of this invention have unique surface characteristics making them useful as molecular sieves and as catalyst or as bases for catalysts in a variety of separation, hydrocarbon conversion and oxidative combustion processes. The TASO composition can be impregnated or otherwise associated with catalytically active metals by the numerous methods known in the art and used, for example, in fabricating catalysts compositions containing alumina or aluminosilicate materials. TASO s may be employed for separating molecular species in admixture with molecular species of a different degree of polarity or having different kinetic diameters by contacting such mixtures with a TASO s having pore diameters large enough to adsorb at least one but not all molecular species of the mixture based on the polarity of the adsorbed molecular species and or its kinetic diameter. When TASOs are employed for such separation processes the TASOs are at least partially activated whereby some molecular species selectively enter the intracrystalline pore system thereof. The hydrocarbon conversion reactions catalyzed by TASO compositions include cracking, hydrocracking alkylation of both the aromatic and isoparaffin types isomerization including xylene isomerization polymerization reforming hydrogenation dehydrogenation transalkylation dealkylation and hydration. When a TASO containing catalyst compositions contains a hydrogenation promoter, such promoter may be platinum, palladium, tungsten, nickel or molybdenum and may be used to treat various petroleum stocks including heavy petroleum residual stocks, cyclic stocks and other hydrocrackable charge stocks. These stocks can be hydrocracked at temperatures in the range of between 204 C 400 F and 441 C 825 F using molar ratios of hydrogen to hydrocarbon in the range of between 2 and 80, pressures between 1,7 bar 10 and 242 bar 3500 p.s.i.g. , and a liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of between 0.1 and 20, preferably between 1.0 and 10. TASO containing catalyst compositions may also be employed in reforming processes in which the hydrocarbon feedstocks contact the catalyst at temperatures between 371 C 700 F and 538 C 1000 F , hydrogen pressures of between 7,9 100 and 36 bar 500 p.s.i.g. , LHSV values in the range between 0.1 and 10 and hydrogen to hydrocarbon molar ratios in the range between 1 and 20, preferably between 4 and 12. Further, TASO containing catalysts which contain hydrogenation promoters, are also useful in hydroisomerization processes wherein the feedstock s , such as normal paraffins, is converted to saturated branched chain isomers. Hydroisomerization processes are typically carried out at a temperature between 93 C 200 F and 316 C 600 F , preferably between 149 C 300 F and 288 C 550 F with an LHSV value between 0.2 and 1.0. Hydrogen is typically supplied to the reactor in admixture with the hydrocarbon feedstock in molar proportions of hydrogen to the feedstock of between 1 and 5. TASO containing compositions similar to those employed for hydrocracking and hydroisomerization may also be employed at between 343 C 650 F and 538 C 1000 F , preferably between 454 C 850 F and 510 C 950 F and usually at somewhat lower pressures within the range between 2,1 bar 15 and 4,5 bar 50 p.s.i.g. for the hydroisomerization of normal paraffins. Preferably the paraffin feedstock comprises normal paraffins having a carbon number range of C₇ C₂₀. The contact time between the feedstock and the TASO containing catalyst is generally relatively short to avoid undersirable side reactions such as olefin polymerization and paraffin cracking. LHSV values in the range between 0.1 and 10, preferably between 1.0 and 6.0 are suitable. The low alkali metal content often not measurable by current analytical techniques of the instant TASO compositions make them particularly well suited for use in the conversion of alkylaromatic compounds, particularly for use in the catalytic disproportionation of toluene, xylene, trimethylbenzenes, tetramethylbenzenes and the like. In such disproportionation processes it has been observed that isomerization and transalkylation can also occur. The TASO containing catalysts for such processes will typically include Group VIII noble metal adjuvants alone or in conjunction with Group VI B metals such as tungsten, molybdenum and chromium which are preferably included in such catalyst compositions in amounts between about 3 and about 15 weight of the overall catalyst composition. Extraneous hydrogen can, but need not be present in the reaction zone which is maintained at a temperature between 204 C 400 and 399 C 750 F , pressures in the range between 7,9 100 and 139 bar 2000 p.s.i.g. and LHSV values in the range between 0.1 and 15. TASO containing catalysts may be employed in catalytic cracking processes wherein such are preferably employed with feedstocks such as gas oils, heavy naphthas, deasphalted crude oil residues etc. with gasoline being the principal desired product. Temperature conditions are typically between 454 C 850 and 593 C 1100 F LHSV values between 0.5 and 10 pressure conditions are between 1 bar 0 p.s.i.g. and 4,5 bar 50 p.s.i.g TASO containing catalysts may be employed for dehydrocyclization reactions which employ paraffinic hydrocarbon feedstocks, preferably normal paraffins having more than 6 carbon atoms, to form benzene, xylenes, toluene and the like. Dehydrocyclization processes are typically carried out using reaction conditions similar to those employed for catalytic cracking. For such processes it is preferred to use a Group VIII non noble metal cation such as cobalt and nickel in conjunction with the TASO composition. TASO containing catalysts may be employed in catalytic dealkylation where paraffinic side chains are cleaved from aromatic nuclei without substantially hydrogenating the ring structure at relatively high temperatures in the range between 427 C 800 F and 538 C 1000 F at moderate hydrogen pressures between 22 300 and 70 bar 1000 p.s.i.g. with other conditions being similar to those described above for catalytic hydrocracking. TASO containing catalysts for catalytic dealkylation are of the same type described above in connection with catalytic dehydrocyclization. Particularly desirable dealkylation reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of methylnaphthalene to naphthalene and toluene and or xylenes to benzene. TASO containing catalysts may be used in catalytic hydrofining wherein the primary objective is to provide for the selective hydrodecomposition of organic sulfur and or nitrogen compounds without substantially affecting hydrocarbon molecules present therewith. For this purpose it is preferred to employ the same general conditions described above for catalytic hydrocracking. The catalysts are the same typically of the same general nature as described in connection with dehydrocyclization operations. Feedstocks commonly employed for catalytic hydroforming include gasoline fractions kerosenes jet fuel fractions diesel fractions light and heavy gas oils deasphalted crude oil residua and the like. The feedstock may contain up to about 5 weight percent of sulfur and up to about 3 weight percent of nitrogen. TASO containing catalysts may be employed for isomerization processes under conditions similar to those described above for reforming although isomerization processes tend to require somewhat more acidic catalysts than those employed in reforming processes. Olefins are preferably isomerized at temperatures between 260 C 500 F and 482 C 900 F , while paraffins, naphthenes and alkyl aromatics are isomerized at temperatures between 371 C 700 F and 538 C 1000 F . Particularly desirable isomerization reactions contemplated herein include the conversion of n heptane and or n octane to isoheptanes, iso octanes, butane to iso butane, methylcyclopentane to cylcohexane, meta xylene and or ortho xylene to para xylene, 1 butene to 2 butene and or isobutene, n hexene to isohexane, cyclohexane to methylcyclopentene etc. The preferred cation form is a combination of a TASO with polyvalent metal compounds such as sulfides of metals of Group II A. Group II B and rare earth metals. For alkylation and dealkylation processes TASO compositions having pores of at least 0,5 nm 5A are preferred. When employed for dealkylation of alkyl aromatics, the temperature is usually at least 177 C 350 F and ranges up to a temperature at which substantial cracking of the feedstock or conversion products occurs, generally up to 371 C 700 F . The temperature is preferably at least 232 C 450 F and not greater than the critical temperature of the compound undergoing dealkylation. Pressure conditions are applied to retain at least the aromatic feed in the liquid state. For alkylation the temperature can be as low as 121 C 250 F but is preferably at least 177 C 350 F . In alkylation of benzene, toluene and xylene, the preferred alkylation agents are olefins such as ethylene and propylene. The TASO compositions of this invention may be employed in conventional molecular sieving processes as heretofore have been carried out using aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or other commonly employed molecular sieves. TASO compositions are preferably activated prior to their use in a molecular sieve process to remove any molecular species which may be present in the intracrystalline pore system as a result of synthesis or otherwise. For the TASO compositions this is sometimes accomplished by thermally destroying the organic species present in an as synthesized TASO since such organic species may be too large to be desorbed by conventional means. The TASO compositions of this invention are also useful as adsorbents and are capable of separating mixtures of molecular species both on the basis of molecular size kinetic diameters and based on the degree of polarity of the molecular species. When the separation of molecular species is based upon the selective adsorption based on molecular size, the TASO is chosen in view of the dimensions of its pores such that at least the smallest molecular specie of the mixture can enter the intracrystalline void space while at least the largest specie is excluded. When the separation is based on degree of polarity it is generally the case that the more hydrophilic TASO will preferentially adsorb the more polar molecular species of a mixture having different degrees of polarity even though both molecular species can communicate with the pore system of the TASO. The instant TASO compositions may be further characterized and distinguished from aluminophosphates by reference to the catalytic properties exhibited by the TASO compositions. When the TASO compositions are tested for n butane cracking and compared with aluminophosphate compositions having a similar topology it has been observed that the TASO compositions are more active catalysts as indicated by a higher numerical value for n butane cracking.
