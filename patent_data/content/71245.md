# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device includes memory cells MC 11 to MC MN arranged in a matrix array, a plurality of pairs of bit lines B0 1 to B0 M, B1 1 to B1 M , each pair of bit lines being connected to the memory cells on the same column, a plurality of pairs of switching MOS transistors TR01 to TR0M, TR11 to TR1M , each pair of MOS transistors being connected between a power source terminal VD and each pair of bit lines, and a precharge control circuit for supplying a control signal to the gates of the switching MOS transistors. This memory device further includes delay circuits DL1 to DLM connected in series with each other, and the delay circuits delay the control signal from the precharge control circuit 2 and supply the control signal to the gates of the switching MOS transistors TR01 to TR0M, TR11 to TR1M at different timings.
