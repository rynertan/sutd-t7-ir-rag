# Polymeric or polymerisable aromatic aliphatic ketones suitable for use as polymerisation photoinitiators.

## Abstract
A new class of polymeric or polymerisabie aromatic aliphatic ketones, the preferred of which are 2 hydroxy 2 methyl 4 vinylpropiophenone , 2 hydroxy 2 methyl p 1 methylvinyl propiophenone, p vinylbenzoyl cyclohexanol, p 1 methylvinyl benzoyl cyclohexanol and their oligo merisation and polimerisation products, they being suit able for use as photoinitiators for the photopolymerisation of ethylenically unsaturated monomers and prepolymers. Said ketones are produced by subjecting an aromatic substrate, preferably a monomer or oligomer of styrene type, to the following reaction cycle polymerisation acyla tion alphachlorination nucleophilic substitution with the formation of epoxyether hydrolysis of the epoxyether or to other reactions as modifications or alternatives to this cycle. The ketones according to the present invention have high efficiency as photoinitiators both with regard to the useful concentration to be used and with regard to the polymerisation rate.
