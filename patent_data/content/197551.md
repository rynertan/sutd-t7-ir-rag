# A display device and a display method.

## Abstract
The present invention generally relates to a display device which is comprised of a first group of bus lines A1 C2 for transmitting a display signal, a second group of bus lines V1 Vm for transmitting a scan signal and a display unit formed at an intersecting point between the first bus line and the second bus line. The first group and the second group of bus lines are formed in matrix. The display device further includes switching elements 20 31 which are selec tively opened or closed, and provided between the bus lines in the first group or in the second group 1. Accordingly, even when it happens that any one of the bus lines is broken, a signal can be supplied from the other bus line to the broken bus line through this switching element.
