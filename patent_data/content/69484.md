# Misoperation prevention circuit.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit IC has an oscillation circuit OSC , for generating clock signals CLOCK , an internal logic circuitry. When the internal logic circuitry IC is not required to be in a operational mode, operations thereof and opera tions of the oscillation circuit OCS are terminated. To prevent misoperations the internal logic circuitry is restored to the operational mode only after restored operations of the oscillation circuit OSC are stabilised. A misoperation prevention circuit comprises an integrat ing circuit R, C which receives a control signal for restoring operations. The integrating circuit delivers a voltage which increases as time passes. A first gate circuit G₁ , having a lower threshold level, is arranged to receive the voltage provided, by the integrating circuit R, C and when that voltage reaches the lower threshold level operations of the oscillation circuit OSC are triggered. A second gate circuit G₂ , having a higher threshold level, is also connected to receive the voltage provided by the integrating circuit R, C . Only when the voltage provided by the integrating circuit reaches the higher threshold level, after a time sufficient for stabilization of the oscillation circuit OSC does the second gate circuit G₂ provide a control signal A which restores the internal logic circuitry to the operational mode.
