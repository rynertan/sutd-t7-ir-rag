# SEALING SYSTEM FOR MOVABLE INSULATION

## Abstract
A curtain 12 of pocket forming material layers 22, 32 is sealed by seal strips 46, 50, 62, 66 on the edges of the layers which slidingly engage seal guides 74, 78, 84, 88 provided in side frame channels 18, 20 , and a housing structure 16 forms a top seal for the curtain 12 . Weight bars 28,38 in the lower extremities of the sheets 22, 32 enhance the seal on the bottom and keep the layers of material separated, and rotatable separating rollers 102, 104, 106 in housing 16 keep the layers separated and help in forming a top seal. A smooth operating manual chain drive 110, 112 and anchor mechanism 120 is provided, as well as a removable decorative fabric 54 for the front of the assembly. Alternative embodiments include top seal guide exten sions for separating the layers, a bottom curved seal guide for accommodating the lower ends of edge seal strips 46, 50, 62, 66 to prevent binding and loss of bottom seal by accommodating differential length movement of front and rear layers 22, 32 , and edge seals for inner layers adapted for sealing edges as well as for maintaining layers separate in non vertical applications.
