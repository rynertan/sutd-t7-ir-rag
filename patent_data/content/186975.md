# 3 PENTENAMIDES FROM 1,3 BUTADIENES

## Abstract
1,3 Butadienes are catalytically hydrocarbamylated to make 3 pentenamides. A compound of the formula R₁R₂CH C R₃ C R₄ C R₅R₆ C O NR₇R₈ is prepared by reacting in an intimate liquid phase a mixture of a compound of the formula R₁R₂C C R₃ C R₄ CR₅R₆, ammonia or an amine of the for mula R₇R₈NH and CO in the presence of a catalyst M
