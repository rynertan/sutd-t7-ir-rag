# HF Alkylation process with maximum heat utilization of isoparaffin recycle.

## Abstract
In an HF alkylation process the mixed paraffin feed fractionator is reboiled by an isoparaffin vapor stream withdrawn from the main fractionator and steam the total quantity of isoparaffin vapor stream withdrawn is regulated by a signal representative of a condition e.g. temperature in the top of the main fractionator, whereas the portion of the isoparaffin vapor stream withdrawn that is used for reboiling is maximized by an automatic predictive heat balance computation and a control signal established accordingly for regulating the flow rates of steam and isoparaffin for reboiling the feed fractionator.
