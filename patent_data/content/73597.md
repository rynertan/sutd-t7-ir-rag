# Process for polymerizing 1,3 butadiene.

## Abstract
A process for polymerizing 1,3 butadiene, comprising bring into contact a 1,2 polymerization catalyst consisting essentially of a soluble cobalt compound, an organic aluminium halide, an organic lithium compound and carbon disulfide or phenyl isothiocyanate with 1,3 butadiene in a polymerization medium. The process can be applied particularly advantageously in the preparation of 1,2 polybutadiene, and the resultant 1,2 poly butadiene has a content of syndiotactic 1,2 structural units of not less than 90 , a melling point of 200 C to 220 C, and an intrinsic viscosity Î· of 1.2 to 7.
