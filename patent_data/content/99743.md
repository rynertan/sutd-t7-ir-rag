# Method and apparatus for detection of breathing gas interruptions.

## Abstract
The pattern of pressure variation in the breathing gas supply is detected by a pressure sensor 50 whose digitized output is fed to microprocessor 56. A reference pattern is stored in memory 54 and the actual pattern is monitored to detect departures from the reference pattern. Display 58 and alarm 60 are activated when comparison by the microprocessor shows a significant deviation from normal. Control panel 62 allows intervention when changes in the breathing pattern result from known external causes. Conventional gas monitor 15 senses the partial pressure of a component of the breathing gas to measure its concentration output signal 68 and also provides a time varying pressure signal 66 which serves as a check on the pressure sensor 50.
