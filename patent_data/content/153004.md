# METHOD OF DETERMINING ENGINE CYLINDER COMPRESSION PRESSURE AND POWER OUTPUT

## Abstract
A method of diagnosing the peak compression pressure and power output of individual cylinders of an internal combustion engine based on stored normalized energy coefficients derived from a normalized pressure curve and the measured instantane ous engine speed.
