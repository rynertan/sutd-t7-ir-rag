# X ray lithographic system, in particular gas control for the same, and method for fabricating a semiconductor substrate.

## Abstract
An X ray lithographic system and method for beam printing on a substrate such as a silicon semiconductor wafer includes a beam exposure chamber 11 , a beam source 13 , a mask holder 15 , a mask 17 including a thin mask membrane 18 closing the exit end 6 of the chamber. A controlled flow of low X ray attenuating gas such as helium is provided to an upper remote portion of the exposure chamber and vent means 21 extends from a lower portion of the chamber adjacent the mask to an exterior exit orifice 23 positioned at mask level to prevent ingress of air to the chamber and prevent deflection and change in the mask to substrate gap distance. The substrate 20 is positioned below the mask membrane and is surrounded by a mask to wafer zone into which is flowed a substrate fabrication process gas which is vented either by a gas flange 25 in spaced gapped relation to the mask holder and mask, or by a vent tube 46 extending from said zone to an orifice end 46a approximate the level of said mask to assure no pressure differential on the top and bottom surfaces of the mask membrane affecting the mask to wafer gap distance 8 during substrate fabrication operations.
