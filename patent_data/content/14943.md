# Process for producing self metering liquid retentive pad and other porous articles of manufacture.

## Abstract
Porous articles of manufacture are produced by mixing a dry particulate material with a polymeric material, the dry particulate material being insoluble and unreactive with the polymeric material. The mixture is preplasticized to form a composite which is then shaped by a molding technique form ing a dense skin 14 on the surface 12 of the article. A solvent is then added to dissolve the dry particulate material. Below the skin 14 , punctuated by a series of very small openings 16 , exists an open polymeric network 18 which can be filled with liquids such as inks to produce self metering pads. Blowing agents can also be included to increase the resiliency of the finished article. Photopolymeric substances can also be employed to achieve desirable surfact pattern characteristics.

## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SELF METERING LIQUID RETENTIVE PAD AND OTHER POROUS ARTICLES OF MANUFACTUREBackground of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention Retentive pads which not only retain a large volume of liquid, but are capable a self metering ftave long been desired for lubricating and marking applicat nS Modern technology in these fields has particularly sought pads which meet these criteria and additionally are sufficiently economical in manufacture that they can be discarded after use. Cbviously, long life pads with lifetimes of 60,000 to 200,000 impressions are highly desirable.The nature of the pad material lends itself to wide application of a myriad of uses. 2. Summary of the Prior Art There have been attempts to produce pads which are self metering and retentive. U.S. Patent 3,2j3,542 to McDonough produced an inked roller which was a s,ubstantial improvement over previous rollers and gave thousands of ink transfer operatins. However, the process requires a compatible plasticizer for the resin to form a plastisol. Salt is added to the plastisol prior to the formation of molding and later leached out. The molding operation was particularly time consuming. Also, the plastisol uzwust be compatible with the filler liquid, in this case ink vehicle and this severely limits wide applicability. U.S. Patent 3,971,315 t w Hansen dislcoses a two layer structure which provides a superior reservoir system. However, compatiDility between the thermoplastic resin, plasticizer for plastisol formation and ink which is dispersed in the macroporous reservoir layer is necessary and limits wide applicability. While greater fluid retention is a ailable, surface metering is not available here. ther U.S Patents of terest are 3,536,796 3,640, 829 3,718,532 3,898,360 and 4,157,424. For a discussion of plastisol compositions, see U.S. Patent 3 928,521. Products produced in accordance with the teachings in U.S Patent 33928,521 suffer from density variation because of the aXr entrapped with the void former. While adequate for many purposes, it still does not met specific design needs and requires lengthy processing steps, It is highly desirable to manufacture pads and other articles quickly and efficiently and achieve in the manufacturing process articles which are consistent in their density. Casting or molding in a form is not particularly suitable for achieving the density control desired although it has served as the principle process in producing articles with high Volume voids. It is also known to product Voicis by the use of blowing agents, but in this case, sie is hardly predictable or reproducible. Therefore, it i an object of the present invention to produce liquid retentive pads which have a consistent and reproducible density in a wide variety of shapes, produced from a wie variety of materials. Furthermore it is an object of the present invention to produce a pad which can be used with a wide variety of liquids tailored for specific uses and not restricted by the compositional requirements of the pad. It is an additional object to product a selfmetering retentive pad in an efficient, rapid mariner. Additionally, it is an object of the present invention to produce a pad usable as a marking pad which contains the desirable col rant without subjecting the pad to long prowess steps Of leaching and back filling. Moreover, it is an object of the preset invention to produce a pad with colorant particles and voices to admit the solubilining vehicle for the dye. It is also an object of the present invention to produce multi layered ink printers suitable for both low and high centrifugal or surface speed printing operations. Yet another object of the present invention is to produce extrudates from extrusion molding processing which contain a high proportion of void formers. Another object of the present invention is to include a blowing agent in combination with void formers to produce an open celled or porous article, thereby permitting a reduction in the amount of void formers required in various molding compositions. This provides pore space for rapid leaching of void former from molded void former polymer compositions, and to provide pore space for addition of solvents to a molded colorant polymer composite. Another object of the present invention is the process of producing a self inked hands tamp or other printing member in the shape of a molded or cast sheet, but embracing certain advances in order to have a highly complicated indicia, yet produced with standard or commercially available equipment designed for the economic production of non porous or non inked photopolymer printing plates and stamps.Summary of the Invention The above and other objects are accomplished according to the present invention by providing a process comprising the steps of mixing dry particulate solid of a size of 2 to 450 microns with a polymeric material in a weight ratio of 2.5 1 to 10 1 solid to polymeric material said solid being insoluble and unreactive with polymeric material preplasticizi le the solid and the polymeric material to form a soliS polymer composite shaping the co posite by casting, extruding, injection or screw transfer molding, or the like to a finished article shape, Thereby a more dense skin portion is formed on the surface of the article and adding to the article a solvent in which the soled is dissolved. The choice of solvents is dependant on both the nature and purpose of the inclusion of the dray particulate solid. If the solid is intended merely as a void former, then the solvent is applied in sufficient quantity to leach the void former from the article leaning behind a porous body with a skin layer having a leather like feel. If desired, the article can then be saturated with a wide variety of liquids depending on the ultimate use for which the article is intended. The dry particulate solid can be a solid colorant. The addition of the solvent for the colorant most advantageously forms a liquid colorant dispensing pad having a self metering skin layer. In this process, the solvent is not a leachate but rather forms a liquid colorant vehicle within the article. If the surface of the article is intended to carry a pattern or indicia, it can be formed during the molding process or a photopolymer can be employed which can subsequently be modified by UV radiation. If a photopolymer is present in the cast or molded article, then usually prior to the solvent addition step, the article is exposed to W radiation through a negative or mask on one surface of the article. The article is then washed in a washout bath to purge the unexposed areas of the article after which it is dried to remove any washout chemicals. The solvent step is then followed as taught elsewhere in this disclsoure. The process can also include a gr√Öanulating step following the preplasticizing step wherein the preplasticized composite material is granulated for convenient storage and later used either alone or with other additional materials. Any of the above processes may employ a blowing agent in a controlled amount sufficient to provide voids for the later addition of the liquid vehicle solubilizing the dye, or to provide pore spaces for rapid leaching of the void and or pore former. The presence of the void spaces also can contribute to the control of flexibility of the finished product. Also in utilizing a blowing agent with a void former, it is possible to produce by either extrusion, including co extrusion, or injection molding, a highly porous product. It should be noted that all of the methods of the present invention employ a mechanical preplasticizing step such as that achieved by a screw turning within a temperature controlled barrel in order to remove essentially all entrapped air, homogenize, compact and plasticize the composite in such a manner as to provide a high rate of production of product which is uniform in density and formable into articles of various shapes. The preplasticizing of the composite permits rapid forming of the article in the die or mold cavity which other molding techniques, such as compression molding, do not permit. Mechanical preplasticizing is not to be confused with chemical plasticizers as the later is not an equivalent substitute and could not achieve the same effect.Suitable Polymers The polymeric materials suitable for use in the present invention are many. Thermoplastic elastomeric resins are used in the basic process. These include a vast number of types making it possible to select almost any resin property for a wide variety of uses. Suitable resins include polyester, polyolefin, polyurethane, ethylene vinyl acetate, 1,2 polybutadiene, styrenebutadiene, polyvinyl chloride, SAN, ABS, ethylenepropylene, styrene isoprene, styrene polyolefin, CAB Teflon FEP, nylon, polyethylene and polypropylene. Also heat curable plasticizable grades of gum stock elastomers may be used such as NBR, SBR, butyl, acrylic, polychloroprene, flourocarbon, silicone, natural rubber, polyisoprene, chlorinated polyethylene, ethylenepropylene, EPDM, PVC NBR and ethylene vinyl acetate. However, in order to use the low thermoplastic gum stock elastomers in the basic mixing and extrusion process, and in order to create a skin effect on the surface of injection molded articles, and also on the extruded pad, the elastomers must be plasticized sufficiently to cause the elastomer to flow under high shear and pressure during the mixing and extrusion, injection or screw transfer molding steps. The flow occurs.without the addition of any external heat to either the mixing vessel or the extruder. Also the plasticizer addition must not be sufficient to cause the formation of a true plastisol. The percentage of plasticizer added is typically in the range of 10 30 by weight of the gum stock elastomer. The above noted polymers are solids. It is also possible to use a liquid or semi solid initially noncrosslinked polymer for a particular application of the invention. Ia order to produce a handstamp of an intricate design, polymers such as photopolymers typically composed of polymers with appropriate initiators incorporated therein.These polymers are primarily intended for flexographic or letterpress printing and show depth variation by removal of the top most layer after selected exposure to ultroviolet light by use of an appropriate mask. Colorants, flow aids, curing agents, etc., are optionally added during the mixing step. Crumb or powdered grades of elastomers are particularly suited for mixing with various colorants and void formers. It is important that the gum stock elastomers and photopolymers always be mixed and molded at temperatures less than the temperature required for curing or cross linking the elastomer, since curing will cause the elastomer colorant with or without void former composite to become solid and prematurely retard the flow required for obtaining the pronounced skin effect. The molded composite is cut and finished to the desired pad size, and then is filled with appropriate solvent in which the colorant, and void former, if present, are soluble. The thermoplastic resins used have a wide melting point range, typically between 75 and 1750 C. Commercial extruders, injection or screw transfer molding apparatus can handle any of theSe resins and plasticized gum stock elastomers. Casting is well known in the art. It is possible to cast the colorant polymer and then apply a vehicle for solubilizing the solid colorant. However, preferred density consistencies, elimination of entrapped air and the unique skin effect are only achieved with extrusion, injection or screw transfer molding. Therefore, pre forming a sheet by molding is the preferred method for producing the hands tamp or similar printing member. Any pattern is from a negative utilizing a photopolymerizable polymer. Injection or screw transfer molding, primarily intended for thermoplastics alone, or very lightly filled thermoplastics, requires particular attention to parameters in order to injection or screw transfer mold the void former and or colorant polymer compositions. This is described below.Colorants The choice of colorant is generally from among the organic dyes well known in the printing part. Resin treated pigments may be used in the invention so long as the resin treated pigment is soluble in the solvent vehicle. Color ant , as used herein includes organic dyes and resin treated pigments. Conventional organic dyes are preferred because they are widely available in a complete range of colors, chemical types, particle sizes and solvent solubilities with the solvent solubility properties offering great latitude in the selection of solvent vehicles for the dyes in specific applications. Void Formers A large choice of void formers is also possible.The void former must not react with the polymeric composition or the dye. Additionally, the void former must be soluble in the solvent, but non reactive with it. Typically, salts such as sodium nitrate, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate also hydrated forms , sugar and friable polyglycol waxes have served as void formers. Such common chemicals are easily obtained and can be easily obtained in sizes desired by the user. Size distributions of 2 to 450 microns are used, but preferable size ranges are specified for specific purposes. The ratio of the void former to the polymer can vary widely. Ratios of 2.5 1 to 10 1 of void former to polymer are general. For specific applications the ratio can vary greatly. Additionally a layered product may employ different ratios in the different layers. In the case of a multitude of layers, the first layer extruded is the most extreme reservoir layer and farthest from the layer with the exposed skin which is contacted oppressed to meter the fluid. For example, a high speed multi layer ink printer has a first reservoir layer of large sized void formers in a weight ratio of typically 7 1 void former to resin and the metering layer has samller void formers in a 4 1 ratio.The reservoir layer can vary greatly as from 10 1 to 5.1 and the metering layer from 5 1 to 2.5 1. While generally the void former when used with a particulate organic dye is sized comparable to the dye, it is not necessary to do so. The ratio of the colorant to tkepolymeric material can vary greatly. Additionally, the ratio can be considered as colorant, that is, colorant combined with void former, to polymeric material. If only colorant is employed, the ratio of colorant to polymeric material can vary from 2.5 1 to 10 1 by weight. If void former is employed, the ratio of colorant to void former can vary from at least 20 1 to 1 1. As noted above, the solid colorant provides a pad with an extremely long lifetime and almost continuous renewal with applications of solubilizing vehicle. The solubilizing step can be hastened, with a small loss in the number of impressions, by providing for voids without the use of solid void formers. This is achieved by utilizing a blowing agent in the colorant polymer composition. A blowing agent is selected which will not decompose or expand at the termperatures used in the preparation of composites, but will gas sharply at the temperature utilized in the forming die or mold. Blowing agents are well known and the typical nitrogen, carbon monoxide and dioxide evolving compounds may be used. The blowing agent is present in an amount to foam the composite, usually 0.5 to 5 by weight and generally 3 . The choice of solvent, i.e., solubilizing vehicle for the dye, is, of course, dependent upon the colorant, and void former if employed. The colorant, and void former, if present, must be soluble and non reactive with the solvent. While this choice is well within the skill of a practitioner in the art, typical solvents for the colorant and toid formers noted are high molecular weight, high flash point, essentially non evaporable fluids such as glycols, glycol ethers, high molecular weight alcohols, fatty acids, esters of fatty acids, glycol esters, mineral oil, petroleum oils, alcohol ethoxylates, polyoxyethylene esters, gly√ßerols and glycerol esters. Preferred choices are polyglycols and high molecular weight alcohols.The solvent additionally may contain processing aids. An interesting effect is achieved when the solvent contains colorant, the same or different from that employed in the composite. The polymeric material and composite may also include lubricants, processing aids, additives, preservatives, etc., in minor amounts. For one preferred embodiment, an ultraviolet activator is present. In the process it is important that the colorant and polymer composition be thoroughly mixed. High shear type mixers such as Readco Sigma Blade Mixers have been used. Mixing speeds of 30 to 150 rpm and time periods of 3 to 30 minutes have been employed. During mixing, the composite may be heated to form a preplasticized mass, and then cooled and granulated prior to use in the molding Improper mixing results in both large holes and nonchanneled areas in the molded polymer matrix which are unacceptable. Testing for completeness of mixing is done by monitoring the torque of the mixer shaft at the controlled mixing temperature. Preplasticizing or mixing is complete when the torque equilibrates and does not increase or decrease more than 10 over a 1 minute time span. Heating, if applied, is generally from 75 to 1750 C. The resultant colorant polymer composite is then cooled.Granulating of the composite is typically done for composites which are prepared and stored for later use. The composite can then be fed to the extruder at ambient to 2050C, and extruded alone or onto a profile. The through put temperature is 48 to 2050C and the exit temperature is 65 to 2050C and is typically LOOC lower than the through put temperatures when using thermoplastic resins. At similar temperatures, times and speeds, additional speeds, additional composites may be simultaneously or subsequently extruded onto the first extruded composite. Simultaneous extrusion is preferred. There are many commercial extruders on themarket suitable for the practice of the present invention. HPM Corporation and Davis Standard Division can supply technical literature. Typically, the extruder provides for heating and cooling and temperature control at inlet, outlet and through put. The extruder also provides for venting or a vacuum to remove entrapped air and any gaseous by products.This is very important in order to assure a reproducible density in the extrudate. Conventional methods of compression molding in a cavity do not result in a high percentage removal of entrapped air, sometimes causing extreme variations in molded product density and dimensions particularly on the molded part surfaces. In extruding onto a profile, crosshead dies are used. Of course, the profile itself can be obtained by extruding with a straight through die. The molten or softened solid polymer composite passes through streamlined channels of ever decreasing cross section traversing a 30 to 90 degree angle to effect alignment with the profile flow. With a pressure type die the profile is coated within the body of the die. Simultaneous or coextrusion of multiple molten layers is used in making a multi layer pad. Commercial extruders providing for four different molten composites are available. Typical temperatures of coextrusion are the same as for single component extrusion. These temperatures are, of course, related to the nature of the thermoplastic resin or gum stock elastomer. The void former is not affected by the temperatures employed, and, suprisingly, the presence of solid particles does not interfere with the success of extruding the molten or plasticized product. The length of residence time in the extruder is influenced primarily by screw length to outer diameter ratio, the pitch and helix angle of the screw flights, the depth of the screw flights and the peripheral speed of the screw.L D ratios of 10 1 to 32 1 and compression ratios of 1 1 to 5 1 are typical, but can be greatly varied as is known in the art. The depth of the layers can vary greatly.Generally, a larger reservior layer will provide for a longer life of the pad. The reservoir layer is preferably thicker than the outer layer. Ratios of 7 1 to 2 1 size of reservoir to metering layer are typical and pad sizes of 1 8 inches to 4 inches thickness or diameters are typical. Conventional injection and screw transfer molding is not intended for highly loaded greater than 20e polymeric materials. In the present invention, the polymer is extended not only greater than 20 but as much as 100 by weight of filler particulate void former and or colorant .The composite is understandably excessively high in viscosity. In injection and screw transfer molding the screw, injection nozzle, sprue bushing, mold runners and gates must be designed to permit the very high viscosity composite to flow freely under high pressures and heat, when used, while being injected or transferred to the mold cavities.Therefore, all channel dimensions leading from the feed hopper to the mold cavities are necessarily larger, by 2 to 3 times, than the channel dimensions used in molding typical extrusion and injection grades of thermoplastic and thermosetting polymeric materials. Cast molding has long been used in forming pads.Simple convenient shapes correlated to the end use are readily available. An interesting application employing cast molding of a colorant and or void former polymer composite in a thin layer upon a supportive substrate or film such as commercially available Mylar polyester film , utilizes the film in a traditional photopolymer apparatus to produce a self inked handstamp with an intricate design.Premolding or pre forming a composite sheet by extrusion of,a composite upon a supportive film or by coextrusion of composite and film is a preferred method over casting because virtually all air pockets are removed from the composite in the process and the resultant stamp is dimensionally more uniform. The pad can have channel sizes ranging from infinitely small to 450 microns and void volumes between 10 and almost 90 depending on the parameters selected.The greater the void volume, the greater the amount of liquid can be retained in the pad. Layers are produced by molding or casting one polymer void former onto a second polymer void former. In this way a wide variety of pore size or channel network after solution of the void former is possible. The nonprinting layer or portion of the pad distant from the printing surface is termed the reservoir layer. The depth of the layers can vary greatly.Generally, a larger reservoir layer will provide for a longer life of the pad. The reservoir layer is preferably thicker than the outer layer. Ratios of 7 1 to 2 1 size of reservior to metering layer are typical and pad sizes of 1 8 inches to 4 inches thickness or diameters are typical in the art. While the term porous has been used in describing the voids or what are sometimes preferred to as open cells, it is preferable to consider that the polymer is a skeletal framework for a diverse network of interconnected channels. It is impossible to designate a typical pore diameter. Rather, it is more reasonable to indicate channel diameters and void percentages. The extruded, injection or screw transfer molded polymer void former composite exhibits a skin on the outermost surface. The skin effect on the molded polymer was unexpected, yet subsequently has proved to be significantly advantageous. While the presence of the void former does not appear to affect the molding process, it does appear that the well mixed void former polymer composite undergoes a shift during contact with the die or mold wall while under high pressure or temperature and that essentially all air pockets are removed from the composite as it is moved by the screw from the mold apparatus feed hopper to the die opening or mold cavity. The polymer appears more concentrated at the surface of the molded product, and the void former, particulate colorant or salt can be said to have migrated away from this surface.In the case of the injection or screw transfer molded polymer, the situation is similar in as much as the void former, colorant or salt tends to be more concentrated in the interior of the molded article leaving a thin skin layer which is more or less continuous. Skin layer depths can vary greatly between different chemical types and grades of resins and plasticized elastomers and typically range between 20 and 150 microns. A skin layer may exist between layers of different composition and vary from 20 to 150 microns. Typically, the skin layer has narrower channel diameters and lower void volume. While great variation is possible, channel sizes of infinitely small to 100 microns are typical and void volume to total volume percentages vary between 10 and 50 percent. The reservoir area can also vary greatly and can be arranged proportionately. The most extreme reservoir area furthest from the skin can have channel sizes, after solution in the case of the colorant, between infinitely small and 450 microns and void volume percentages between 60 and 86 percent. The channel sizes can be proportionately decreased toward the skin layer. Basically, the pad consists of. a microporous polymer layer integral with a skin portion but upon solution of the colorant, or colorant and void formQx, has channels and pores larger than the outer skin portion and the pad has an outer skin portion of a molded.micro porous polymer layer with the density greatest at the skin portion. The pad can have multi layers with interconnectoA channels of various sizes, usually largest in the extreme reservoir, and smallest in the skin and intermediate sizes therebetween. The density is greatest with the skin portion and decreases with the cross sction. The particular embodiment with the cast polymer for hands tamp or the like does not have the skin portion and the density and channel sizes are generally uniform and consistent over the entire casting. The use process is essentially a pumping process. The polymer must be sufficiently elastomeric to pump upon pressure. The metering rate is dependent on the viscosity of the contained fluid, on the size of the voids in the skin, on the channel sizes in the reservior, and on the degree of elasticity of the compressible porous pad. The finishing steps of the molded colorantpolymer composite are dictated by the desired use.Cutting, shaping forming indiciaand affixing of handles, hubs, are well known in the art, and can he performed before or after any of the curing, crosslinking, washing, leaching, filling or solvating stens. The extruded and leached composite. may additionally be treated by conventional methods to form a. stamp pad as illustrated in Figure 7. The composite is form molded to receive the appropriate indicia. The skin on the indicia is unaltered by the moldina and the portion without indicia has the channels and voids reduced. Thus, printing and metering are exclusively through the indicia. Molding is conventional but generally the temperature is between 75 and 2050C and the residence time in the mold between 5 seconds and 15 minutes. Filling the composite with liquid, or solvating the colorant with solvent can be done using any number of conventional techniques. Vacuum filling has typically been used in filling voids and soaking is typically used in solvating colorant and or void ormr. Saturation of the colorant by solvating vehicle can be accomplished by manual application or mechanical metering of the solvent upon demand hy the printing surface. lifetype of the pad is almost limitless because solvent can be applied as often as needed since the pad contains an abundant supply of colorant. Print impressions in excess of the one million are typical. The void formers are leached from the extruded polymeric matrix by a suitable solvent which does not affect the polymer. Water soluble salts are typically used and warm water is a typical solvent. However, a wide variety of solvents may be employed. Preferably, the solvent does not hinder the final drying step. Washings may he employed to remove any excess solvent. The leaching or removal of the void formers or salt is easily accomplished by a rapid flushing through the pad. With water soluble void formers, warm water generally between 45 and 550C is an apt choice of leaching solvent. The pads are conventionally dried, using ovens generally at 45 to 950C or air drying and subsequently filled with the desired fluid. Conventional filling techniques are employed. Vacuum filling is commonly practiced in ink filling. A wide variety of liquid fillers can he incorporated into the channels and contained in the reservoirs. Those skilled in the art are familiar with suitable fluids and manner of fillings which are.conventional. Dys,sj pigments, lubricants and other fluids must be chosen of a particle size to pass through the outer skin layer. By way of example from the many fluids available, commiorciallar prepared inks from Frye CopySystems, Inc. have been employed as have commercial oils from Dow Corning Corporation. Vacuum filling has typically been used for filling the pads. The physical features of the products produced by the present invention are illustrated in the accompany ing figures.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a photomicrograph of a marking pad produced according to the inventive process illustrating the existence of a surface skin on the outermost portion of the pad. Figure 2 is a photomicrograph of a pad produced according to the method of the present invention illustrating the boundary region between ttro adjacent layers of differing void volumes. Figure 3 is a flow diagram of the basic processes of the invention. Figure 4 is a sectional view of a cross head die for use in the extrusion process of the present invention. Figure 5 illustrates various precursors in the formation of a product according to the present invention. Figure 6 is an exploded view of a roller produced according to the present invention. Figure 7 is a view of a stamp pad with raised indicia. Figure 8 is a flow diagram of two processes wherein photopolymers are employed to form raised indicia. Description of the Preferred Embodiments Figure 1 is a reproduction of a photomicrograph taken of a section of a liquid retentive pad 10 according to the present invention. An examination ofFigure 1 reveals that the outer surface 12 of the pad consists of a substantially continuous skin 14 punctuated by a series of very small openings 16. Below the skin level 14 there exists an open network or matrix of polymeric filaments 18 having therebetween a series of continuously connected channels 20 into which a suitable liquid can be inserted. It is to be noted from the photomicrograph tbat the mean cross section of the channels 20 is considerably larger than the apparent opening size of openings 16.This smaller size of openings 16 performs a self metering function inasmuch as only a limited volume of liquid can exit through the series of small openings 16 when the pad 10 is placed under a particular force. This concentration of polymer at the surface 12 of the extruded product thereby providing the skin effect illustrated was an unoxpectod yet significantly advantageous result of the process employed. Figure 2 is another reproduction of a photomicrograph illustrating the boundary between two differing regions of polymer wherein the concentration and size of the void former was varied so as to form a surface layer 22 and a reservoir layer 24. It will be noted that in the reservoir layer 24, the channels existent in the elastomeric matrix forming the pad are of significantly greater diameter and frequency, thereby permitting the greater subsequent storage of liquid. The details of construction of each of the samples illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 are to h found in ,xamples I and II herein. Figure 3 shoves the general process of forming liquid retentive elements according to the present invention. In the most general case, a polymeric material 26, which can be either liquid, slab, or particulate solid, a colourant 24, if desired, and a void former 28 are mixed in a mixer 30, which can optionally include a heating or cooling means 31.The polymer, colorant, and void former are then fed from the mixer into molding apparatus 32. Within the molding apparatus, the material fed from the mixer 30, or optionally bulk storage 46, is preplasticized and then forced into a die or mold. The articles 40 emerging from the die or mo are then processed by one of tfo possible methods If colorant 24 was used in the composite preparation, then the elements 40 are inserted into a filling solvent bath 43 for solvating the colorant present to form the elernents 45. If only void former is present, the elements 40 are then inserted into a leaching solvent bath 42 for leaching out the void former from the elements 40. The leachednlemsnts 41 are then removed from the solvent bath and dried in dryer 44. Subsequently, an ink or other desired liquid is inserted within the polymeric material to form the finished product. Variations on this general process include bulk storage means 46 for various mixtures of polymer and void former for later use according to the present invention. While Figure 3 illustrates the use of but a single extruder and die, it will he appreciated that more than one extruder may feed a single die so as to create a layered product having two or even more layers with different void volumes and or channel sizes to serve various, purposes. The leaching of the extruded product 38 in the solvent bath may be conventionally performed either before or after the product is period ically served by a cutter, and may include mechanical agitation or manipulation steps so as to insure complete removal of the soluble void former from the molded product.The unleached product is more rigid and thus easier to shape. A discussion of the exact parameters employed in the various steps of the process is to be found in the foregoing summary of the invention, and in the subsequent examples Figure 4 is illustrative of one type of die 48, commonly known as a cross had, which can be used in the present invention most advantageously to form a roller having an at least semi rigid central member. As illustrated, the polymer melt 50 including the particulate void former exiting from extruder 32 is introduced into an orifice 54 which conducts the melt 50 so as to surround a guide or point 54.A rod or tubular momber 56 is continuously inserted from the left through the point 54 and into cavity 58 where the mlt 50 envelops the rod or tube 56. A portion of the melt 50 maintained in its plastic state by heater 60 then adheres to the moving rod or tube 56 and exits as a continuous layer of uniform thickness, the thickness being determined hy the size of the die opening 62, the viscosity of the melt 50, and the rate of movement of rod or tube 56. WhileFigure 4 illustrates the use of a 90 degree cross head die for the production of a supported roller, 45 degree and 30 degree cross head dies might also h similarly used. For the production of various other shapes accoring to the design intended, straight through dies and offset dies might be used as well as cross head dies.Of particular interest is the use of co extrusion dies whereby a multi layered product can be formed in a single step using two or more extruders feeding a single die, In Figure 5, there is illustrated, by way of example, a tubular insert 56 which could be used as a central supporting member of a single layered rollor 64 or double layered roller 66 hy employing the method according to this invention. Subsequent to the extrusion of the polymer containing the void former onto the central supporting mixer 56, the product, as it exited from the extrusion die1 is periodically severed into lenghts 1 convenient to the ultimate utility of the roller 68. The roller is subsequently treated so as to remove the solvent, and an ink or other desired liquid is subsequently inserted by a vacuum or other process into the roller. As illustrated in Figure 6, end caps 70 can then be attached to the roller by inserting the stuh shafts 72 of each end cap within the hollow cylindrical supporting member 56. A close friction fit between the stub shafts 72 and hollow member 56 with the possible addition of a suitable cement maintains the end elements 70 in position. The end elements 70 prevent the liquid retained by the foller from exiting the ends of the roller, thereby insuring the desired self metering pumping action across the cylindrical surface of roller 68. Figure 7 illustrates a finished stamp pad 74 comprising a surface layer 22 and a reservoir layer 24.The surface layer 22, after its initial formation, has been depressed and at least partially sealed in region 76 thus leaving undisturbed a raised indicia region 78.The selE metering function of the surface layer 22 is unchanged in region 78, while invention 76 the surface has been modified to substantially prevent the transpiration of liquid held within the pad 74. It will be appreciated that injection molds or screw transfer molds can also be employed in the present invention with the process and dimensional modifications to conventional practice noted previously and explained more fully in the subsequent example. Figure 8 shows the general process of forming a self inked hands tamp or similar printing member used in various printing or stamping mechanisms commonly found in a variety of commercial applications such as flexographic printing plates. In the most general case, which is output from a mixer such as mixer 30 in Figure 1, includes a photopolymer, or more properly a monomer or prepolymer which is polymerizahle upon exposure to ultravoilet or other radiation. The preplastcized photopolymer colorant void former composite is then processed by two possible methods Process A Casting Method A photographic negative 127 is positioned on the glass plate 128 of a casting and exposure unit 120. A thin clear plastic film 126 is placed over the negative 127 to prevent its contact with the liquid or semi solid polymer colorant void former composite 125.A uniform layer of preplasticized composite 125 and a polyester backing sheet 122 are applied on top of the cover film 126 with the use of a leveling blade 123 and roll down mechanism 130. The casting and exposure unit 120 is then closed and the composite 125 is exposed toUV radiation from the backside 121 and relief side 129 light sources. After exposure, the developed stamp or plate element 132 with adhered polyester backing 131 is removed from the exposire unit 120 and placed into a washout and drying unit 160, where the unexposed areas of the composite are washed out with a mild detergent solution or organic solvent. The element is then druid in the same unit. If colorant is used in the organic composite preparation, then the stamp or plate element is inserted into a solvent vehicle bath 161 for solvating or dissolving the colorant present in the developed composite.If only void former is present in the organic composite preparation, t1n the washed out element is placed in a solvent solvent bath 162 for leaching out the void former from the element. The element is then removed from the solvent bath and dried in dryer 163. Subsequently, an ink or other desired liquid is inserted within the polymeric matrix. The inked or filled element is then assembled and finished 165 by common methods known in the industry for producing self inked handstamps and various printing members.Process B molding Method The mixed composite is fed from the mixer into molding equipment 140 which eliminates any air poc ets present in the composite and extrudes the composite through a die 141 forming a continuous composite film 142 which is then laminated to a supportive thin film substrate 143. The laminated film composite 144 is fed to a sheeter 145 where the laminate is cut into the desired size sheets 146. t photographic negative 154 is positioned on the glass plate 156 of any exposure unit 150. A thin clear plastic film 155 is then placid over the negative 154 and a sized sheet of laminated film composite 146 is placed in position over the thin plastic film 155.The exposure unit is closed and the composite is exposed to W radiation from the backside 151 and relief side 157 light sources for the desired period of time for each side. After exposure, the developed plate or stamp element with backing is removed from the exposure unit and placed into a wasbout and drying unit 160, where the unexposed areas of the composite are washed out with an appropriate solvent or detergent solution. The element is then dryed in the same unit. If the colorant 103 is used in the original composite preparation, then the stamp or plate element is inserted into a vehicle solvent hath 161 for solvating or dissolving the colorant present in the developed composite. If only void former 104 is present in th original composite preparation, then the washed out element is placed in a leaching solvent bath 162 for leaching out the void former 104 from the element. The element is then removed from the solvent bath and dried in dryer 163. Subsequently, an ink or other desired liquid is inserted within the polymeric matrix. The inked or filled element is then assembled and finished 165 by common methods known in the industry for producing so inked handstamps and various printing members. Variations on this general process outlined inFigure 3 includes bulk storage 46 for various preplasti cized a nd granulated mixtures of polymer, colorant, additives and void formers, and including the addition of blowing agents and additives when desired. The injection molding process described above utilizes conventional molding apparatus, readily available commercially. Injection and screw transfer molding equipment is available from PTI, Englel, Toshiha. This type of equipment is necessary to preplasticize the various composites prior to injection or transfer of the composite to the mold cavities. Both types of equipment utilize a screw turning within a heated temperature controlled barrel in order to convey the composite from the feed hopper to the mold cavities, thereby both preplasticizing and eliminating air from the composite. Standard operating conditions and machine settings for molding unfilled thermoplastic and thermosetting materials are available from any of the suppliers. In order to practice the present invention certain modifications ara necessary in the injection procedure. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. These non limiting cxamples are illustrative of certain embodiments designed to teach those skilled in the art how to practice the invention and to represent the hst mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. Example I, A self metering low peripheral speed single layer liquid retentive pad or roller is produced as follows. By weight 87.5 parts of sized particles of ground sodium nitrate from Croton Chemical Company are provided by mechanically sifting the salt through a 40 mesh screen. The sized particles less than 450 microns are thoroughly mixed with 12.5 parts of a thermoplastic extrusion grade polyurethane resin in a Sigma Blade type mixer having its jacicet maintained at 170 to 1780C during the mixing time of 12 to 15 minutes. The polyurethane resin used has a SA hart rests value of 80 90 durometer. The mixed salt polymer composite is allownd to cool to 20 to 320F before granulating in a mechanical blade chopper to a composite particle size dimension of 1 8 inch maximum. The granulated composite is continuously fed to the extruder hopper where it is continuously extruded through a cross head die to form the desired shape and size part. The extruder uses a screw design having a 20 1L D ratio and a compression ratio of 1.5 1. The extruder barrel temperature is maintained at 196 202 C and the die temperatures maintained at 188 194 C. The die pressure is controlled at 4,000 to 5,000 p.s.i. by varying the peripheral speed of the screw and by adjusting the barrel t2mperaturQ up or down within the temperature range stated. The extruder barrel is vented to permit any entrapped air to escape from the composite as it is moved along the barrel toward the forming die.It is extremely important to permit the air to escape since entrapped air pockets will cause undesirable variation in the density of the saltpolymer composite. The formed extrudate is periodically cut to size as it exits the die opening and the savrd parts are guided to a cooling and leaching hot water tank where they are leached at a water temperature of 45 to 550C for a period of 24 to 48 hours. The residual salt is rinsed from the parts with tan water at room temp e,r,atues,for 2 to 4 hours. The rinsed microporous part is dried in an oven between 80 and 85 C for a period of time required to dry off any residual rinse water. The microporous part is completed and ready for use as a pad or roller.The pad or roller may be conventionally filled, with liquid such as ink by the methods well known in the art.Example II A self metering high peripheral speed 420 FPli multi layer liquid retentive pad or roller is produced as follows. A granulated composite mix for use as the reservoir layer of the pad or roller is produced by preparing exactly the sam salt polymer composite as described in Example I. A second granulated composite mix for use as a metering layer is prepared in exactly the same methbd as described in Example I except that 80 parts of 400 mes dimensions less than 38 microns sodium nitrate and 20 parts by weight of the same polyurethane re.sin are sed. The granulated composites are simulatanously fed to two separate extruders which extruded through a single co extrusion die. The extruders attach to the die at a 900 angle to each other with the reservoir layer composite passing straight through the die body and opening, and the metering layer composite entering the die at a 900 angle to the reservoir compsoite. The two composites flow together within the die body and exit the die opening as a layered composit The extruding conditions are the same for each extruder and are the same as the conditions shown in Example I except that the ratio of mitering layer composite to reservoir layer composite delivered to the die is controlled by varying the ratio of the peripheral screw speed of one extruder to that of the second extruder . As the layered extrudate exits the die opening the layered composite is processed in exactly the same manner as in Example I. Example III This example is illustrative of preparing a self metering low peripheral speed single layer liquid retentive pad or roller employing plasticized gum stock elastomer as the resin and sodium nitrate as the void former. Basically, the procedure of Example I was followed with the following exceptions. By weight 85 parts of a polyurethane millable gum stock elastomer having a Mooney viscosity of between 20 and 40, and with a sulfur cure system added, was mixed with 15 parts of coumarone indene resin for plasticizing. The sized particles are mixed with the plasticized gum stock elastomer in a Sigma Blade type mixer keeping the temperature below 1000C or 4 to 5 minutes.The preplasticized salt elastomer composite is granulated in a mechanical blade chopper to a particle size convenient for use in the extruder. The extruder barrel tempo.rature is maintained at 60 71 C and the extruder die is controlled at 88 99QC to avoid cross linking. The die pressure is 5000 to 6000 p.s.i. Tho extrudate is scvored as it exits the die opining in the same manner as in Example I. The severed parts are then conveyed to a forced hot air oven and the elastomeric polymer is cross linked in the oven at 170 177oC for 12 to 15 minutes before leachingr drying and filling as shown in Example I.Example IV This example is illustrative of a self metering high peripheral speed multi layer liquid retentive pad or roller. A granulated composite mix for use as the reservoir layer of the pad or roller is produced s shown in Exarnple XII. A second granulated composite mix for use as a metering layer is prepared as shownin Example III except that 80 parts of 400 mesh to dimensions less than 38 microns sodium nitrate and 20 parts of tho samo gum stock elastomer are used. The composites are simultaneously extruded as shown in Example II with the exception that the condi tions of Example III,are employed to avoid crosslinking. Subsequent severing, cross linking, leaching, drying and filling are as indicated in Example III. Example V This example is illustrative of producing a self metering single layer liquid retentive ink pad on a tubular profile. The process of Example I is followed for preparing the salt resin composite. The composite is extruded from a co extrusive extruder employing a nonelastomeric polyurethane resin with no salt in one portion to form the profile and the salt resin composite in another second extruding hopper. The conditions and procedure is as given in Example II. The roller with the single layer liquid retentive pad is cut into appropriate lengths, leached and dried. The pad is filled with ink employing the vacuum method. Hubs are attached to the roller as indicated in Figure 6. Example VI This example is illustrative of preparing a pad with raised indicia. A self metering multi layer stamp pad is produced as follows. The process ofExample II is followed exactly for producing a multi laird co extruded composite. As the layered extrudate exits the die opening, it is severed into blanks to a size suitable for the desired stamp pad. The sized composite blanks can now be stored until required, whereupon they are compression molded to receive the desired characters or indicia. A mold is prepared from a suitable material such as aluminim, stainless steel, bakelite matrix board, etc. having an engraved cavity with the desired stamp size dimensions and an engraved relief of the desired indicia height. The layered composite blank is placed in the mold cavity with the metering layer in contact with the relief side of the mold. The mold is closed to compress the composite at 50 60 p.s.i. platen pressure for 15 30 seconds at 140 1480C to form the stamp into the fixed dimension of the mold cavity. The mold is then opened and the molded stamp is removed for cooling at ambient temperature. After cooling, the stamp pad is leached, dried and filled in the same manner as in Example I.After filling, the pad is ready for mounting to the appropriate mounting apparatus such as holders and handles commonly used in the industry. Example VII A self inked liquid retentive pad or roller is produced as follows By weight 83.3 parts of a metal chelated dye with p, articles sized to less than 200 microns are thoroughly mixed with 16.7 parts of thermoplastic syndiotactic 1, 2 polybutadiene resin in aSigma Blade type mixer having its jacket maintained at 130 to 1500C during a mixing time of 5 to 8 minutes. The preplasticized dye, polymer composite is allowed to cool to room temperature before granulating in a mechanical blade chopper to a particle size dimension of 1 8 inch, maximum. The granulated composite is continuously fed to the extruder hopper x7h reit is picked up hy the screw, plasticized, and continuously extruded through a cross head die to form the desired part, shape and size. The extruder uses a screw design having a 20 1L D ratio and a compression ratio of 1 1. The extruder barrel temperature is maintained at 160 to 1700C and the die temperature is maintained at 120 to 1600C. The extruder head pressure is controlled at 4000 to 5000 p.s.i , by varying the peripheral speed of the screw and by adjusting barrel and die temperature up or down within the temperature range stated. The formed et.trudate is periodically cut to size as it exits the de opening and the severed parts are guided to a solvent vehicle bath where the dye present in the extruded parts is solvated by soaking in a polyglycol or high molecular weight alcohol dye vehicle. The formed extrudate may also be finished with appropriate hardware prior to the solvating step, or packaged and stored for manual or batch solvating at a later date. Example VIII A self metering liquid retentive pad or roller is produced exactly as in Example VII with the single exception that 15 3 arts by weight of particles of friable high molecular weight polyethylene gylcol wax sized to 200 to 450 microns, are substituted for 15 parts of the metal chelated dye.Example IX A self metering liquid retentive pad or roller is produced exactly as in Example VII with the following exceptions 1. A 3.0 addition based on the weight of the thermopoastic resin1 of p,p oxybis benzene sulfonyl hydrazide blowing agent is added to the composite just before the granulating step. 2. The die temperature at the extruder exit is reduced to 100 to 500C below the temperature of the die entrance at the extruding head. 3. A breaker plate is present having 1 8 diameter holes uniformly distributed to create a 50 restriction in the belt flow area. These three changes cause the composite to expand just as it enters the die cavity from the extruder head and to be set to size by cooling just prior to exiting the die opening.Example X This example is illustrative of preparing highvoid volume self metering liquid retentive pad or roller with a significantly reduced percentage of void forming materials. By weight 70 parts of ground sodium nitrate particles sized to less than 450 microns are thoroughly mixed with 30 parts of thermoplastic syndiotactic 1,2 polybutadiene resin in a Sigma Blade type mixer having its jacket maintained at 130 to 1500C during a mixing time of 5 to 8 minutes. The mixed salt polymer composite is allowed to cool to room temperature. The composite is placed in a mechanical chopper and a 3 58 addition, based on the weight of the thermoplastic resin, of azodicarbonamide chemical blowing agent is made. The composite is .granulated and dry blended with the blowing agent. The granulated composite with blowing agent is continuously fed to the extruder hopper where it is picked up by the screw, plasticized and mixed, and continuously extruded through a cross head die to form the desired part, shape and size. The extruder uses a screw design having a 20 1 L D ratio and a compression ratio of 1.5 1. The extruder barrel temperature is maintained at 140 to 1500C.The extruder head pressure is controlled at 3,000 to 4,000 p.s.i., by varying the peripheral speed of the screw and by adjusting barrel and die temperature up and down within the teri iperature ranges stated above and below. The inlet die temperature is maintained at 1400C and the outlet die temperature is maintained between 85 and 1050C. The formnd extrudate is periodically cut to size as it exits the die opening and the severed parts are guided to a cooling and break ing water tank where they are bleached free of the sodium nitrate salt. The leading open celled or porous parts are then oven or air dried. The porous parts are complete and ready for use as a pad or roller. The pad er roller may then be conventionally filled with liquid such as ink by the methods well known in the art.Example XI This example is illustrative of preparing an open celled high void volume pad, roller or similar porous structure using a significantly reduced percentage of void forming material. The resultant product is capahle of being utilized not only for a liquid retentive pad or roller, but for numerous other applications requiring br desiring an open celled or porous structure having a high degree of void volumes and compressibility. The produce is produced exactly as is Example X with the following exceptions 1. By weight, 14 parts of ethylene vinyl acetate resin having 15 √≥ vinyl acetate content and 1 part of DOP plasticizer are substituted for I5 parts of the syndiotactic 1, 2 polybutadiene resin. 2. The ground sodium nitrate is sized to between 200 and 450 microns. This resultant product has a leather like feel, excellent flex resilience, compression rebound, tear strength, and in addition, possess excellent abrasion, oiland ozone resistance and good weatherability. The product demonstrates rapid moisture or fluid absorption thereby providing wide utility for use in items such as handle bar, tool and sporting equipment grips and components, paint applicator rollers and pads, and sound and shock absorption components and filtering media.Example XII A self metering liquid retentive pad or roller is produced as follows. The material used in Example VII is used in this example. Instead of extrusion molding, injection or screw transfer molding, utilizing the process and equipment described above, is employed. MMen the injection process is utilized the following deviations from conventional procedures are used 1. The screw design is of the low or no compression type, 1 1 to 1.5 1 This condition is necessary because after the air is eliminated from the composite the highly loaded polymer can only be compressed slightly due to the presence of large quantities of non compressible particulate constitutent in the composites. If too much compression is attempted, preplastization and flow of the composite will not occur. 2. The screw L D ratio is 20 1 or greater. If the machine design has a screw L D ratio less than 20 1, then the composite is either preheated in an oven to approximately 1000C in order to improve the plastization rate obtained with relatively low L D ratio of screws. 3. All channels or openings in the flow path of the composite from the feed hopper to the mold cavities are larger by approximately 1008. 4. ,The length of the runners in the mold are kept to a minimum to facilitate rapid delivery of the necessarily high viscosity composite. 5. Injection pressure is necessarily 50 to 100 higher in order to rapidly move the relatively high viscosity composite from the hot screw tip to the substantially lower temperature mold and completely fill the mold cavities and create the marked skin effect on the finished part. 6. The molding temperature of the barrel, end cap, nozzle and sprue bushing are 10 250 higher in temperature than that recommended by the suppliers of injection molding grades of resins Trqhen the screw transfer molding process is utilized the basic equipment and conditions are exactly as for injection molding except that a transfer chamber substitutes for the space where preplasticiz d composite is accumulated prior to being injected into the mold cavities. It is important that the transfer chamber maintains the temperature of the composite at the sam temperature of the composite present at the screw tip.Example XIII A self metering liquid retentive pad or rollr is produced exactly as in Example XII with the single exception that 15 parts by weight of particles of friable high molecular weight polyethylene glycol wax, sized to 200 to 450 microns, are substituted for 15 parts of the metal chelated dye.Example XLV A self metering liquid retentive pad or roller is produced exactly as in Example XII with the following exceptions 1. A 50 addition, based on Che weight of, the thermoplastic resin, of p,p Oxybis benzene sulfonyl hydrozide blowing agent is added to the composite just prior to the granulating step 2. The composite with incorporated blowing agent is held under pressure by incorporating a positive shut off type nozzle on to the barrel end cap for injection molding. 3. A short shot, less than mold cavity volume, is metered and rapidly injected into the. mold where free expansion of the plasticized composite completely fills the cavity. The amount of composite.metered is controlled by adjusting the screw back pressure. 4. Mold venting is increased to allow for rapid displacement of the air gases present in the mold cavities. 5. In the process of screw transfer molding the barrel temperature is maintained at 20 30 C less than the temperature of the transfer chamber.Example XV This example is illustrative of preparing a high void volume, self metering liquid retentive pad or roller with a significantly reduced percentage of void forming materials utilizing the injection or screw transfer molding process. A composite is prepared exactly as in Example X except that a 5.0 addition, based on the weight of the thermoplastic resin of azodicarbonamide chemical blowing agent is made. The granulated composite with blowing agent is continuously fed to the injection or screw transfer molding machine hopper where the composite is molded under the exact same conditions used in Example VIII. The molded parts are then guided to a cooling and leaching water tank when they are leached free of the sodium nitrate salt. The leached open celled or porous parts are then oven or air dried. The porous parts are complete and ready for use as a pad or, roller. The pad or roller may then be conventionally filled with liquid such as ink by the methods well known in the art.Example XVI This example is illustrative of preparing an open celled high void volume pad, roller or similar porous structure using a significantly reduced percentage of void forming material. The resultant product is capable of being utilized not only for liquid retentive pad or roller, but for numerous other applications requiring or desiring an open celled or porous structure having a high degree of void volume and compressibility. The product is produced exactly as in ExampleXV with the following exceptions 1. By weight, 14 parts of ethylene vinyl acetate resin having 15 vinyl acetate content and 1 part of DOP plasticizer are substituted for15 parts of the syndiotactin 1, 2 polybutadiene resin. 2. The ground sodium nitrate is sized to between 200 to 450 microns. This resultant product has a leather like feel, excellent flex resilience, compression rebound, tear strength, and in addition1 possesses excellent abrasion, oil and ozone resistance and good weatherability. The product demonstrates rapid moisture or fluid absorption thereby providing wide utility for use in items such as handle bar, tool and sporting equipment grips and components, point applicator rollers and pads, and sound and shock absorption components and filtering media.Example XVII A self metering liquid retentive pad is produced as follows . By weight 87.5 parts of particles of ground, sodium nitrate, sized to less than 450 microns, are thoroughly mixed with 12.5 ,parts of thermoplastic syndiotactic 1, 2 polybutadine resin in a sigma blade type mixer having its jacket maintained at 130 150 C during a mixing time of 5 8 minutes. The resin has aShore A hardness of 80 90 durometer. The mixed salt polymer composite is allowed to cool to room temperature before granulating in a mechanical chopper to a composite particle size of 1 8 , maximum The granulated composite is continuously fed to an injection or screw trans fer feed hopper where it is molded exactly as the equipment and conditions stated in Example XII. The molded parts are guided two a cooling and leaching water tank where, the parts are leached free of salt. The leached parts arse then oven or air dried.The porous parts are complete and ready for use as a pad or roller. The pad or roller may then be conventionally filled with a liquid such as ink by the methods well known in the art.Example XVIII A self inked printing member with a complicated design based on a negative is prepared in accordance withProcess A described above. The photopolymer is a liquid, Photopolymer grade, FA 95 available from hercules. The colorant is the same as that used in Example VII. Colorant and photopolymer are mixed at room temperature. The procedure is as described in Process A employing conventional conditions. Slightly longer light exposures are used due to the absorbance of the dye. Solvation of the dye gave a printing member with a highly complicated indicia in a long life pad.Example XIX A seli inked printing member with a complicated design based on a negative is prepared in accordance with Process B described above. The photopolymer is based on thermoplastic syndoitactic 1, 2, butadiene with a photo initiatox 2, 2, dimethoxy 2 phenyl acetophenone which is 3 108 of the polymer. The void former is sodium nitrate sized to 200 450 microns. For a 100 parts of photopolymer, 400 parts of sodium nitrate. Following the described Process B, perchlorolethylene is the solvent used to leach out the non cross linked polymer. The salt is subsequently washed out with water. Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments and specific examples, variations and modifications can be performed within the scope and spirit of the invention as described and as defined in the following claims.
