## Description
TAPE POSITION DISPLAY APPARATUS USING COUNTER ROLLER PULSES AND Ctl PULSES Field of the Invention This invention generally relates to a tape position display apparatus and, more particularly, is directed to a tape position display apparatus for use with a VTR video tape recorder , an audio tape recorder and the like.Description of the Prior Art In the prior art, there are known the following tape position display apparatus. One of the tape position display apparatus is such one in which there are provided with a roller rotating with the tape running while in contact with a magnetic tape, a rotation detector attached to the roller and a count display apparatus driven by a tape running amount detecting pulse derived from the rotation detector thereby to display a tape running amount.The other of the tape position display apparatus is such that a position signa l CTL signal is recorded along the side edge of the magnetic tape in its longitudinal direction with an equal distance, while the magnetic tape is transported, the position signal is reproduced by a magnetic head from this magnetic tape and the count display is driven by a tape running amount detecting pulse derived from the magnetic head thereby to display the tape running amount. While the former tape position display apparatus has an advantage that a tape running amount detecting pulse of high reliability can be produced continuously, it has a defect that if the magnetic tape and the roller are slipped with each other or the magnetic tape is slackened, the detecting accuracy of the tape running amount detecting pulse is lowered. Although the latter apparatus has improved the defect of the former apparatus, if a dropout occurs in the playback of the position signal, the detecting accuracy of the tape running amount detecting pulse is lowered inevitably. Therefore, such a tape running amount detecting apparatus is proposed, which is formed of the combination of the above two apparatus and which can therefore improve the accuracy of the tape running amount detecting pulse see a published document of Japanese patent application examinedNO. 9504 1983 . Such previously proposed tape running amount detecting apparatus will be described hereinbelow with reference toFig. 1. While the embodiment of the above described published document employs a quinary counter, this example show in Fig. 1 employs an otonary counter for simplicity of explanation, In Fig. 1, reference numeral 4 designates an octorary up down counter. A first pulse resulting from mechanically detecting the tape transport, which is applied to an input terminal X, is applied to the clock input terminal of the counter X, and a tape transport direction detecting signal resulting from mechanically detecting the tape transport is supplied to the up down change over signal input terminal of the counter 4 through an input terminal 2. The signals supplied to the input terminals 1 and 2 are procured as follows. what is, a roller rotating with the tape running while in contact with the magnetic tape is attached with a rotation detector and rotation pulses having a phase difference of 900 are supplied to the rotation detecting circuit and then the rotation detecting circuit produces the above mentioned signals. Reference numeral 5 designates a logic circuit which receives outputs 2 Q1 and Q0 of 22, 21 and 20 digits from the counter 4 to thereby produces a pulse at every one cycle of the counter 4 which pulse is supplied to a count display 6. Also this logic circuit 5 supplies to a reset preset pulse generating circuit 7 a gating signal so as to remove a noise. In this case, the count display 6 also receives the tape transport direction detecting signal derived from the input terminal 2. This display 6 is arranged to display the tape transport amount in the form of hour, minute, second and frametl 30 second . The reset preset pulse generating circuit 7 receives the tape transport direction detecting signal derived from the input terminal 2 and a second pulse which is gated by the above mentloned gating signal which results from the tape transport, derive from the input terminal 3 and supplies the reset pulse and the preset pulse to the counter 4 on the basis of the above signals. The second pulse applied to the input terminal 3 is the reproduced signal reproduced by the magnetic head from the position signal CTL signal recorded on the side edge of the magnetic tape in its longitudinal direction with an equal distance. In this case, the second pulse is the pulse of fiOM.z when the magnetic tape is transported at a normal tape speed.Then, the frequency of the first pulse is selected 2402 30Hz x 8 upon the normal tape speed. The operation of the prior art tape transport amount detecting apparatus shown in Fig. 1 will be described with reference to Figs. SA to 2H hereinafter. First, let it be assumed that the second pulse supplied to the input terminal 3 is neglected. Then, when the tape is transported in the positive direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse in the positive direction, if the binary number is converted to the decimal number, the counted content of the counter 4 is changed in the sequential order of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... as shown in Fig. 2A. When on the other hand the tape is transported in the opposite direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse in the reverse direction, if the binary number is converted to the decimal number, the counted content of the counter 4 is changed in the sequential order of 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, ... as shown in Fig. 2F. The pulse, which is supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the display 6, is generated when the counted content of the counter 4 is changed from the maximum value to the minimum value and vice versa, or the most significant bit output Q2 of the counter 4 is changed in level from nl to O or O to nln The gating signal supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the reset preset pulse generating circuit 7 this gating signal is used to gate the second pulse is the signal which becomes high level when the counted content of the counter 4 lies in 2 range from 6 tc 2 or a to 6 and which becomes low level in other cases as shown in Fig. 2B. The operation of the tape transport amount detecting apparatus will be further considered together with the second pulse to be supplied to the input terminal 3. In the case where the tape is transported in the positive direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse in the positive direction as shown in Fig, 2D, when the counted content is 7, if the second pulse is produced, the reset pulse is supplied from the reset preset pulse generating circuit 7 to the counter 4 so that as shown in Fig. D, the counted content is changed from 7 to O as shown in Fig. 2D. Thereafter, counted content is changed in the order of. 1, 2, 3, When the counted content becomes 0, the second pulse is generated as shown in Fig. 2C but the counted content is not changed at all.When the counted content of the counter 4 ischanged from 7 to O as shown in Fig. 2E, the pulse is generated from the logic circuit 5 and then fed to the count display 6, in which the displayed content is incremented by 1 each. Further, in the case where the magnetic tape is transported in the opposite direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse in the reverse direction as shown inFig. 2Ç, when the counted content is 2, if the second pulse is generated as shown in Fig, 2C, the preset pulse is supplied from the circuit 7 to the cpunter 4 so that the counted content is changed to 7 as shown in Fig 2G and is.being changed in the order of 6, 5, 4,.,. thereafter, When the counted content becomes 7, the second pulse is generated as shown in Fig. 2C but the counted content of the counter 4 is not changed at all. When the counted content of the counter 4 is changed from 2 to 7 or O to 7 as shown in Fig. 2H, the pulse is derived from the logic circuit 5 and. then fed to the count display 6 in which the displayed content is decremented by 1 each. By the way, in the tape transport amount detecting apparatus shown in Fig. 1, since the counted content of the counter 4 which counts the first pulse is changed by the second pulse, it is possible to detect the tape transported amount with high accuracy. On the contrary, in the prior art apparatus, it is impossible to check whether the first pulse which results from mechanically detecting the tape transport is delayed from the second pulse which results from reproducing the position signal recorded on the tape or not and to see the difference amount terebetween. Further it is not possible to know much difference they have. Furthermore, if the phase difference between the first and second pulses is large, there is a defect that the phase of the tape transported detecting pulse finally obtained is considerably changed by the second pulse thoroughly. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a tape position display apparatus which can detect the tape running amount with high accuracy. It is another object of this invention to provide a tape position display apparatus which can confirm a phase difference of a first pulse, which results from mechanically detecting the transportion of the tape relative to a second pulse, which results from reproducing a position signal recorded on the tape. It is a further object of this nvention to provide a tape position display apparatus in which even when the phase difference between the first and second pulses is large, the phase of a tape running amount detecting signal to be obtained finally can be changed gradually. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided E tape position display apparatus using counter roller pulses and control pulses comprising a means for generating a first electrical pulse in response to a tape running b first counter means for counting said first electrical pulse c means for generating a second electrical pulse indicative of a control track signal reproduced from a tape in response to a tape running d second counter means for counting said second electric pulse e subtracting means for detecting a difference between an output count value from said first counter means and an output count value from said second counter means and f comparing means for comparing an output value from said subtracting means with a predetermined value, wherein the counting direction of said second counter means is controlled on the basis of a compared result from said comparing means and a tape position is displayed in response to the output value of said subtracting means.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFRRED EMBODIMENTS Now, an embodiment of a tape position display apparatus according to this invention will hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, reference numeral 4 designates an up down counter of, for example, octonary type.A first pulse, which results from mechanically detecting the tape running is applied through an input terminal 1 to a clock input terminal of the counter 4 while a tape running direction detecting signal, which results from mechanically detecting the tape running, is applied through an input terminal 2 to an up down switching signal input terminal thereof. The signals supplied to the input terminals 1 and 2 are produced from a first pulse generating means 30 which is shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, there is provided a roller 20 which is rotated in accordance with the tape running while in contact with a magnetic tape TP. This roller 20 is attached with a rotation detector 21 formed of a rotation magnet 22, which is attached through a shaft to the roller 20, and the magnetic heads 23 and 24 . First and second rotation pulses see Figs. 5A and 5B having a phase difference of 900 therebetween are supplied to a rotation detecting circuit 25.Then, the rotation detecting circuit 25 produces a first pulse of 240Hz Fig. 5C corresponding to the leading and trailing edges of the rotation pulses Figs. 5A and 5B and a tape running direction detecting signal Fig. 5D . Referring back to Fig. 3, reference numeral 9 designates a latch circuit which receives outputs Q2, Q1 and QO of the digits 22, 21 and 20 as inputs D2, D1 and Do thereof from the counter 4 and which latches them by the second pulse supplied thereto from an input terminal 3 through a gate circuit 8.The second pulse 30Hz is obtained by reproducing by second pulse generating means fixed magnetic head 31 a position signal CTL signal 28 that is recorded on the side edge of the tape TP at its longitudinal direction as shown in Fig. 4. A subtracter 10 is formed of a full adder, to which the outputs Q2 Q1 and QO of the digits 22, 21 and 20 are supplied at its inputs A2, A1, Ao from the counter 4 and outputs L2, L1, Lo of the digits 22, 21 and 20 are supplied at its inputs B B1, Bow from the latch circuit 9, and in 2 which the latter is subtracted from the former. A logic circuit 5 receives outputs C2, C1 and CO of the digits 2ê, 2Ú and 20 from the subtracter 10, produces one pulse at every one cycle and the counter 4 and supplies it to a count display 6. Also, the logic circuit 5 supplies a gate signal to the gate circuit 8 for the purpose of removing d noise. In this case, the count display 6 receives the tape running direction detecting signal from the input terminal 2.The count display 6 displays the tape running amount in the form of hour, minute, second and frame 1 30 second . Further, reference numeral 11 designates a corrected data display which receives the latch outputs L0, L1 and L2 of the latch circuit 9 to thereby display the corrected data. The operation of the tape position display apparatus show in Fig. 3 will be described next with reference to the timing charts of Figs. 6A to 6K. First, when the tape is transported in the positive direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse, if the binary number is converted to the decimal number, in the positive direction, the counted content of the counter 4 is changed in the sequential order of 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3, ... as shown in Fig. 6A. Whereas, when the tape is transported in the opposite direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse, if the binary number is changed to the decimal number, in the opposite direction, the counted content of the counter 4 is changed in the seq uential order of 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 6, ... as shown in Fig. 6G. The pulse supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the count display 6 is produced when the counted content of the counter 4 is changed from the maximum to the minimum, or when the value of the most significant output Q2 of the counter 4 is changed from 1 to non or non to 11111. The gate signal which gates the second pulse supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the gate circuit 8 is a signal which becomes high level when the counted content of the counter 4 lies in a range from, for example, 6 to 2 or 2 to 6 and which becomes low level in other cases. Next, in the case where the tape is transported in the positive direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse in the positive direction as shown in Fig. 6A, when the counted content of the counter 4 is 7, if the second pulse is generated as shown in Fig. 6B, the counted countent 7 is latched in the latch circuit 9 as shown in Fig. 6C. Then, since in the subtracter 10 from the counted content of the counter 4 there is subtracted 7 sequentially, the output from the subtracter 10 becomes as shown in Fig. 6D. Then, as shown in Fig. 6F by the solid line, when the output from the subtracter 10 is changed from 6 to 0 and from 7 to 0, the logic circuit 5 generates pulses which are then supplied to the count display 6 to increment its display one by one. Fig. 6E shows the gate signal supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the gate circuit 8. On the other hand, when the counted content of the counter 4 is changed from 7 to 0, as shown by broken lines inFig. 6F, a pulse is produced from the logic circuit 5 and fed to the count display 6 which then increments one by one the value of the display thereof. Further, in the case where the tape is transported in the opposite direction and the counter 4 counts the first pulse in the opposite direction as shown in Fig. 6G, when the counted content of the counter 4 is 1, if the second pulse is produced as shown in Fig. 6B, the above counted content of 1 is latched in the latch circuit 9 as shown in Fig. 6H. Then, since 1 is each subtracted from the counted content of the counter 4 in the subtracter 10, the output of the subtracter 10 becomes as shown in Fig. 6I. When the output from the subtracter 10 is changed from 0 to 7, as shown by the solid lines in Fig. 6K, the pulse is produced from the logic circuit 5 and fed to the count display 6 in which the value of the display content thereof is decremented one by one.Fig. 6J shows the gate signal that is supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the gate circuit 8. On the other hand, when the counted content of the counter 4 is changed from 0 to 7, as shown in Fig. 6K, the pulse is generated from the logic circuit 5 and then fed to the count display 6 in which the value of the displayed content thereof is each decremented one by one. Accordingly, the count display 6 displays both the tape running amount made by the counting of the first pulse and the tape running amount corrected by the second pulse. It may be enough that the frequency of the first pulse is selected to be higher than three times the frequency of the second pulse, if it is selected more preferably 2n n 2, 3, 4, ... times the frequency of the second pulse, the circuit arrangements of the counter and the logic circuit can be simplified. Another embodiment of the tape positon display apparatus according to the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, like parts corresponding to those of Fig. 3 are marked with the same references and will not be described. In Fig. 7, reference numeral 4 designates an up down counter of, for example, octonary type. The first pulse, which results from mechanically detecting the tape running, is supplied from an input terminal 1 the clock input terminal of the counter 4, while the tape running direction detecting signal, which results from mechanically detecting the tape running, is supplied from an input terminal 2, to an up down switching signal input terminal thereof. In this case, the latch circuit 9 receive outputs 12, 11, 1o of digits 22, 21, 20 from an adder 12 as inputs D2,D1, Do and latch the same by the second pulse applied to its clock input terminal from the input terminal 3. The subtracter 10 is supplied with the output Di Q2, Q1, QO of digits 22, 21, 20 from the counter 4 and the output DC L2, L1, L0 of digits 22, 21, 20 from the latch circuit 9, in which the latter is subtracted from the former. Reference numeral 13 designates an identifying circuit which receives the outputs D0 C2, C1, CO of the outputs 22, 21 and 20 from the subtracter 10 and the tape running direction detecting signal from the input terminal 2. When the tape TP is transported in the positive direction, if the output Do of the subtracter 10 advances in phase to any one of 1, 2 and 3, a 1 is obtained as an output Du if the output Do delays in phase to any one of 4, 5, 6 and 7, a 1 is obtained as the output Du and if the output Do of the subtracter 10 is zero and has no advanced or delayed phase, O is obtained as the output Du.When on the other hand the tape TP is transported in the opposite direction, if the output Do of the subtracter 10 advances in phase to any one of 1, 2 and 3, a 1 is obtained as the output Du if the output Do delays in phase to any one of 4, 5 and 6, a 1 is obtained as the output Du and if the output Do is O or 7 and has no advanced and delayed phase, 0 is obtained as the output Du, wherein a may be selected to be more than 2 or may be changed in accordance with the value of the output Do The adder 12 receives the output Dc of the latch circuit 9 and the output Du of the identifying circuit 13 and produces an added output Dun 12, I1, leo . This output DN is supplied to the latch circuit 9 and then latched therein by the second pulse from the input terminal 3. The overall of the subtracter 10, the identifying circuit 13 and the adder 12 can be formed of a ROM read only memory . As shown in Fig. 7, in this embodiment, the logic circuit 5 receives the output C2, C1 CO of the digits 22, 21 and 20 from the subtracter 10 and the tape running direction detecting signal from the input terminal 2 and produces square wave signals each having a phase difference of 90 at every cycle of the counter 4. The square wave signals are delivered from the logic circuit 5 to the count display 6. The count display 6 displays the tape running amount in the form of hour, minute, second and frame 1 30 seconds . Further, reference numeral 74 designates a corrected data display which receives the latch output L0, L1, L2 from the latch circuit 9 to thereby display the corrected data. The operation of the tape position display apparatus shown in Fig. 7 will be described with reference to the timing charts of Figs. 8A to s and Figs. 9 to 9. Figs. 8A to 8N are respectively timing charts showing a case in which the tape TP is transported in the positive direction. In this case, Figs. 8A to 8G show a case in which the phase of the output Do of the subtracter 10 is advanced relative to the second pulse this second pulse is rerresented as P2 , while Figs. 8H to 8N show a case in which it is delayed relative to the second pulse.In Figs. 8G and 8N, reference letter X designates a pair of tape running amount detecting signals which are supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the count display 6 and which are each a square wave signal having a duty ratio, 50 upon normal mode and which rises up when the signal Do is changed from 3 to 4 and falls down when the signal Do is changed from 7 to 0. Although the other tape running amount detecting signals are not shown, each of them becomes a signal which results from advancing the phase of the signal X by 900 when the tape TP is transported in the positive direction. As shown in Figs. 8C and 8F, when DO 3, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches DN O to thereby produce the output Dc O. Then, since the Dc O is subtracted from Di 2 in the subtracter 10, the outpout Do is decreased by 7 from 3 to 2 immediately. Further, as shown in Figs. 8C and 8F, when Do 2, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches DN l to thereby produce the output Do 1. Then, since Dc 1 is subtracted from Di 2 in the subtracter 10, the output Do is decreased by 1 from 2 to 1 immediately. Further, as shown in Figs. 8C and 8F, when Do 1, if the second pulse P2 is generated, the latch circuit 9 latches DN 2 and hence DC 2 is obtained therefrom. Since in the subtracter 10 DC 2 is subtracted from Di 2, the output Do is decreased from 1 to O by 1 and coincides in phase with the second pulse P2. In this case, it is needless to say that even if thereafter the second pulse P2 is produced when Dg O, the output Do O is not changed at all. As shown in Figs. 8J and 8M, when D 5, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches the DN 4 to thereby produce the output Doc 4. Then, since Dc 4 is subtracted from Dj 2 in the subtracter 10, the output Do is increased by 1 from 5 to 6 immediately. As shown in Figs. 8J and 8M, when D0 6, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches DN 3 to thereby produce the output Dc 3. Then, since Dc 3 is subtracted from Di 2 by the subtracter 10, the output Do is increased by 1 from 6 to 7 immediately. As shown in Figs. 8J and 8M, when Do 72 if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches Dun 2 to thereby produce the output Dc 2. Then, since Dc 2 is subtracted from Di 2 by the subtracter 10, thus the output Do is increased by 1 from 7 to 0 immediately and coincides in phase with the second pulse P2. Figs. 9A to 9N are respectively timing charts each useful for explaining a case in which the tape TP is transported in the opposite direction. In this case, Figs. 9A to 9G respectively show the case in which the output Do of the subtracter 10 is advanced in phase relative to the second pulse P2, while Figs. 9H to 9N respectively show the case in which it is delayed in phase therefrom. In Figs. 9G and 9N, reference letters X respectively designate a pair of tape running amount detecting signals that are supplied from the logic circuit 5 to the count display 6. Each of the tape running amount detecting signals is the square wave signal having the duty ratio, 50 upon normal mode and which rises up when the output Do is changed from 0 to 7 and which falls down when the output Do is changed from 4 to 3.Although the other tape running amount detecting signals are not shown, when the tape TP is transported in the opposite direction, each of them becomes a signal which results from delaying the phase of the signal X by 900. As shown in Figs. 9C and 9F, when DO 4, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches DN O to thereby produce the output Dc O. Then, Dc O is subtracted from Di 5 in the subtracter 10, so that the output Do is increased by 1 from 4 to 5 immediately. As shown in Figs. 9C and 9F, when Do 52 if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches DN 7 to thereby produce an output Dc 7. Then, the Dc 7 is subtracted from Di 5 in the subtracter 10 so that the output Do is increased by 1 from 5 to 6 immediately. As shown in Figs. 9C and 9F, when Do 6, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches DN 6 to thereby produce an output Dc 6. Then, Dc 6 is subtracted from Di 5 by the subtracter 10, thus the output Do is increased by 1 from 6 to 7 immediately and coincides in phase with the second pulse P2. As shown in Figs. 9J and 9M, when Do 2, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches D to thereby produce an output Dc 4. Then, Dc 4 is subtracted from Di 5 by the subtracter 10, so that the output Do is decreased by 1 from 2 to 1 immediately. As shown in Figs. 9J and 9M, when Dug 1, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the latch circuit 9 latches DN 5 to thereby produce an output Dc 5. Then, Dc 5 is subtracted from Di 5 by the subtracter 10, so that the output Do is decreased by 1 from 1 to 0 and coincides in phase. with the second pulse P2. As mentioned above, even if the phase difference between the output Do from the subtracter 10 and the second pulse P2 is large, such phase difference is gradually decreased each time when the second pulse P2 arrives so that when the tape running direction detecting signals with the phase difference of 900containing an information regarding the tape running direction are produced from the logic circuit 5 and then fed to the count display 6, there is no fear that the mis operation will occur in the count display operation of the count display 6. In this connection, the count display 6 of this kind, which receives the two square wave signals having the phase difference of 900 therebetween and containing the tape running direction information and displays the counte value, will be mis operated if the phase of the tape running amount detecting signals is changed considerably. Further, even if the noise is mixed into the second pulse P2, the output from the subtracter 10 is not changed so much so that such tape position display apparatus will be affected a little by the mis operation due to the noise. A further embodiment of the tape position display apparatus according to this invention will be described next with reference to Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, like parts corresponding to those of Fig. 7 are marked with the same references and will not be described in detail. In Fig. 10, reference numeral 15 designates another counter to the clock terminal of which the second pulse is supplied from the terminal 3 and the output Dc P2, P1, PO of the digits 22, 21 and 20 from this counter 15 is supplied to the subtracter 10, in which it is subtracted from the outputDi Q2, Q1 Qo of the counter 4. Reference numeral 16 designates an identifying circuit which receives a signal C2,C1, C0 K K2, K1, K0 resulting from phase inverting theMSB most significant bit of the output Do C2, C1, CO from the subtracter 10 by an inverter 17 and compares it with a reference signal J J2 J1, J0 100 4 .In this case, K D0 4 is established. The up down counter 15 for counting the second pulse P2 from the terminal 3 is controlled by the output from the identifying circuit 16. To be more concrete, when J K, the counter 15 is operated in the up count mode, while when J K, the counter 15 stops its count operation. The operation of the tape position display apparatus of the invention shown in Fig. 10 will be described with reference to Figs. 8A to 8N and Figs. 9A to 9N, wherein Di represents the output from the counter 4, Dc represents the output from the counter 15 and Do represents the output from the subtracter 10. A first explanation will be given on the operation of the tape position display apparatus in a case in which the tape TP is transported in the positive direction. As shown in Figs. 8C and 8F, when Do 3 if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the up mode because K 7 so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 7 to O. Thus Dc O is subtracted from Di 2 in the substracter 10 so that the output Dc is decreased by 1 from 3 to 2 immediately. As shown in Figs. 8C and SF, when D0 2, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the up mode because K 6 so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 0 to 1, whereby Dc 1 is subtracted from Di 2 in the subtracter 10 and thus the output Do is decreased by 1 from 2 to 1. As shown in Figs. 8C and 8F, when D0 1, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the up mode since K so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 1 to 2, whereby Dc 2 is subtracted from Di 2 in the substracter 10 and thus the output Do is decreased by 1 from 1 tc 0 and coincides in phase with the second pulse P2. Thereafter, even if the second pulse P2 is produced when Do O, K R is established so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is nct changed at all and thus Do O is not changed, too. While, as shown in Figs. 8J and 8M, when D0 5, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the down mode since K 1, so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is charged from 5 to 4, whereby Dc 1i is subtracted from Di 2 in the subtracter 10 and thus the output Do is ir mediatey increased by 1 from 5 to 6. As shown in Figs. 8J and SM, when Do 6, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the down moàe since K 2 so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 4 to 3, whereby Dc 3 is subtracted from Di 2 in the subtracter 10 and thus the output Do is immediately increased by 1 from 6 to 7. As shown in Figs. 85 and SM, when nDo 7, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the down mode since K 3 so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 3 to 2, whereby Dc 2 is subtracted from Di 2 in the subtracter 10 and thus the output DO is immediately increased by 1 from 7 to 0 and coincides in phase with the second pulse P2. A next explanation will be given on the operation of the tape position display apparatus in a case in which the tapeTP is transported in the opposite direction. As shown inFigs. 9C and 9F, when D0 4, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the down mode since K O so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 7 to 0, whereby Dc O is subtracted from Di 5 in the subtracter 10 and thus the output Do is immediately increased by 1 from 4 to 5. As shown in Figs. 9C and 9., when Do , if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the down mode since K 1 so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 0 to 7, whereby Dc 7 is subtracted from Di 5 in the subtracter 10 and thus the output Do is immediately increased by 1 from 5 to 6. As shown in Figs. 9C and 9F, when D0 6, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the down mode since K 2 so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 7 to 6, whereby Dc 6 is subtracted from. Dints in the subtracter 10 and thus the output Do is immediately increased by 1 from 6 to 7 and coincides in phase with the second pulse P2. Further, as shown in Figs. 9J and 9, when D0 2, if the second pulse F is produced, the counter 1 is set in the up mode since K 6 so that the output Dc from the counter 15 is changed from 3 to 4, whereby Dc 4 is subtracted from Di in the subtracter 10 and thus the output D0 is immediately decreased by 1 from 2 to 1. Furthermore, as shown in Figs. 9J and 9M., when D0 1, if the second pulse P2 is produced, the counter 15 is set in the up mode since K 5 so that the output Dc from. the counter 15 is changed from 4 to 5, whereby Dc 6 is subtracted from Di 5 in the subtracter 10 and thus the output Do is medi ten y decreased by 1 from 1 to 0 and coincides in phase with the second pulse P2. In the tape position display apparatus shown in Fig. 10, such a version may be possible, in which the counter 15 is formed as a counter of 2 scale counter and of the outputsP3, P2, P1 Po of digits 23, 22, 21, 20, the outputs P3,P2, P1 Dc of the higher significant three digit are supplied to the subtracter 10. As a result, even if the second pulse is supplied to the counter 15, the outputs P3, P2 P1 are never changed at all so long as the two second pulses are not supplied so that the phase of the output Do from the subtracter 10 is changed more slowly. In this case, if the scale of the counter 15 is selected to be more than and the outputs of three higher digits are fe to the subtracter 10, the phase of the output Do from the subtracter 10 is changed much more slowly. The above description is given on the preferred embodiments of the invention but it will be apparent that many modifications and variations could be effected by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirits or scope of the novel concepts of the invention so that the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims only.
