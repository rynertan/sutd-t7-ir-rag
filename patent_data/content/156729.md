## Description
INNER SALTS OF PHOSPHONIC ACID USEFUL IN THE PROTECTION OF PLANTS FROM PATHOGENESIS CAUSED BY FUNGI The present invention relates to inner salts of phosphonic acid, to a process for preparing them and to their subsequent use in agrarian applications. Published literature, such as published French patent application 2 254 276, describes fungicidal compositions containing, as an active substance, derivatives of phosphonic acid having the general formula EMI1.1 wherein R is an optionally substituted alkyl, aikenyl,alkynyl, aryl or heterocyclic radical and M is a cation of ammonium or of a metal. The Applicant has now found inner salts of phosphonic acid, which are the object of the present invention and which have never been described in literature, having the general formula I EMI1.2 wherein R is H, or a C1 C2 alkyl radical R1 and R2, identical or different, are H, C3 C4 alkyl when R is H, Cl C12 alkyl when R is C1 C2 alkyl, C3 C5 alkenyl or alkynyl when R is H, C3 C12 alkenyl or alkynyl when R is C1 C2 alkyl, C1 to C12 alkoxyalkyl the 1 to 12 carbon atoms forming both alkyl and alkoxy moieties, aryl, in particular phenyl, when R is C1 C2 alkyl, aralkyl, or R1 and R2, together with the N atom form a non aromatic hetero cycle formed of 5 or 6 atoms, possibly containing other hetero atoms, in particular 0, N and S, and optionally substituted by C1 C4 alkyls and by alkylcarbonyls having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety, said heterocycles being preferably pyrroli dine, piperidine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperazine R3 and R4, identical or different, are H or C1 C4 alkyl or phenyl radicals. The compounds of formula I present the property of protecting plants from pathogenesis due to fungi, and are consequently utilizable in agrarian applications. A further object of the present invention are compositions containing the compounds of formula I as an active substance. Still another object of this invention consists in the synthesis processes for obtaining the compounds of formula I . Further objects of the present invention can be inferred from the following description and examples. The compounds of formula I , in which R is C1 C2 alkyl, have been prepared by reacting a dialkylphosphite, preferably a dimethylphosphite or diethylphosphite, with a 2 hydroxyalkylamine according to the following reaction scheme EMI2.1 where R, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined herein before. The reaction is conducted by bringing the two reagents into contact in a inert solvent, by heating the resulting solution to a temperature ranging from 1300 to 1900C for a period of from 1 to 6 hours and by removing, at a final step, the alcohol which has formed, while the product to be obtained is separated from the solvents by means of conventional separation, purification, extraction and crystallization techniques, usually adopted for isolating the products of organic syntheses. The inert solvents which are useful in the synthesis process of the present invention are selected from the classes of apolar solvents or of aprotic polar solvents.Some examples of apolar solvents are the halobenzenes, in particular 1,2 dichlorobenzene, the xylenes, decaline and tetraline.Some examples of aprotic polar solvents are dimethylformamide, acetonitrile. In particular, according to a preferred method of the invention, stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of a dialkylphosphite and of a 2 hydroxyalkylamine are reacted in 1,2 dichlorobenzene while heating the solution at reflux for a period ranging from 1 to 5 hours. Thereafter the lower alcohol is distilled off from the reaction atmosphere. Once all the alcohol has been removed, the solution is cooled and the ionic product is isolated by removing the react ion solvent. The product to be obtained can finally be purified by treatment with a polar solvent, such as, for example, acetonitrile, from which it is separated by filtration or by decantation. Examples of compounds prepared according to the process described in detail in the following example 1, method B, are indicated in Table I. The compounds of formula I , in which R is H, are prepared by reacting under heating a dialkylphosphite, preferably dimethylphosphite or diethylphosphite, with a 2 hydroxyalkylamine, in the presence of at least a stoichiometric amount of water, according to the following reaction scheme EMI3.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same as defined herein above.

The solvents which are utilized in the synthesis process of the present invention are selected from the classes of the apolar solvents, such as e.g. 1,2 dichlorobenzene, or of the protic polar solvents, such as e.g. methanol or a H20 methanol solution. The type of solvent to be employed depends upon the type of 2 hydroxyaLlkylamine utilized. In particular, if apolar solvents are utilized, stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of a dialkylphosphite, of a 2 hydroxyalkylamine and of water are reacted in 1,2 dichlorobenzene, while heating the mixture at reflux during a period of from 0.5 to 3 hours. The lower alcohol is then distilled off from the reaction atmosphere by gradually raising the mixture temperature to 170 1800C. Once all the alcohol had been removed, it was cooled doçn and the ionic product was separated from the apolar solvent. The product thus obtained is purified by hot treatment with a lower alcohol methanol, ethanol, isopropanol . After the final hot treatment, the compounds are generally present in fhe form of crystalline solids. Examples of compounds prepared according to the process described in further detail in subsequent example 2, method C, are indicated inTable II. If it is operated in protic polar solvents, the reaction is carried out by contacting stoichiometrically equivalent amounts of a dialkylphosphite and of a 2 hydroxyalkylamine in the presence of a solvent mixture consisting of water and methanol. The solution is heated while distilling off from the reaction atmosphere both the dissolving methanol and the lower alcohol methanol or ethanol which forms during the reaction. The reacting mass is then introduced into a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure, while gradually raising the temperature to 140 160 C. The residue obtained under these conditions is purified by means of a hot treatment with a lower alcohol methanol, ethanol, isopropanol .

Such an application, which is called preventive application, makes it possible to obtain a protection effective at least 7 days after treatment by inoculation of the plant with the pathogenic stock. On the other hand, the defence action also occurs in the case of treatment of plants already inoculated with the pathogenic stock in such a case, the application has a curative effect, due to the systemic properties of the products forming the object of the present invention. When a treatment of this type is carried out for curing vine plants in which the infection caused by Plasmopara viticola is still active, the Applicant has surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention prove to be very effective. This effect is fully unexpected since the check compound Aliette , representative of the phosphorous acid salts known up to now, when applied under the same conditions, does not exhibit any activity see Table III . Systemic properties means a complex of characteristics which permit these compounds to penetrate the plants either through the leaves or through the roots and to migrate in the plants vascular systems so as to act in an immunizing or curative way also in the parts not directly treated, but subject to infecting attacks. For practical utilizations in agriculture it is often advisable to have compositions available containing one or more compounds of formula I as an active substance. These compositions can be applied to every part of the plant, such as e.g. leaves, stems, branches and roots, or to the seeds prior to sowing, or also to the earth around the plant. It is possible to utilize compositions in the form of dry powders, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, slurries or pastes, granulates, solutions, suspensions and the like the choice of the type of composition will depend upon the intended specific use. The compositions are prepared in e conventional manner, for example, by diluting or dissolving the active substance in a dissolving medium and or in a solid diluent, optionally in the presence of surfactants. As solid diluents, or carriers, the following may be used silica, kaolin, bentonite, talc, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, magnesia, gypsum, clays, synthetic silicates, attapulgite, sepiolite.As liquid diluents besides water, of course, various types of solvents may be used, for example aromatics benzoyl, xylols or mixtures of alkylbenzols , chloroaromatics chlorobenzol , paraffins petroleum fractions , alcohols methanol, propanol, butanol , amines, amides dimethylformamide , ketones cyclohexanone, acetophenone, isophorone, ethyl amyl ketone , esters isobutyl acetate . As surfactants, the following may be used sodium salts, calcium salts, triethanolamine of alkylsulphates, alkylsulphonates, alkyl arylsulphonates, polyethoxylated alkylphenols, fat alcohols condensed with ethylene oxide, polyoxyethylated fat acids, sorbitol polyoxyethylated esters, polyoxyethylated fats, ligninsulphonates. The compositions may also contain special additives for particular purposes, for example adhesion promoting agents such as arabic gum, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone.If desired, it is also possible to add to the compositions of the present invention other active compatible substances, such as fungicides, herbicides, phyto growth regulators, insecticides, fertilizers. The concentration of active substance in said compositions mayVary over a wide range, depending upon the active compound, the culture, the pathogenic fungus, the environmental conditions and the type of formulation utilized. When emulsifiable concentrates are used, they are diluted until a concentration of active substance ranging from 0.1 to 5 g l of aqueous emulsion is obtained. The following examples are given to illustrate the present invention.EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of 2 trimethylammonium ethyl phosphite inner salt compound No. 1 .Method AA solution consisting of 22 g of dimethylphosphite and 17.8 g of 2dimethylamino ethanol in 50 ml of N,N dimethylformamide was heated at reflux during 6 hours. After this treatment the reacting mass was concentrated by distilling off, at normal pressure, the reaction methanol and about 20 ml of the solvent.The mixture was then evaporated in a rotary evaporator at a residual pressure of 15 torr, the bath temperature being raised to 800C. The residue obtained was treated under intense stirring with 100 ml of acetonitrile, thus leading to a solid which was separated by filtration and dried in a drier under vacuum. 24 g of product were obtained.The compound appeared as a white hygroscopic solid. .P. 208 210 C dec .I.R. nujol 2330 cm 1, 1230 cm 1, 1060 cm 1.

Once the addition had been achteved the mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes, and successively the methanol released during the reaction was slowly distilled off, until a temperature of 1700C was reached. The mixture was then cooled and the solvent was separated by decantation from the insoluble oil like phase, which was then refluxed during 1 hour with 50 ml of methanol.In this way a solid in suspension was obtained, which was separated by filtration and dried in a drier under vacuum.

Once the addition had been achieved the solution was heated by slowly distilling off the methanol from the reaction atmosphere. Successively, the reaction mass was transferred into a rotary evaporator and it was gradually heated, under reduced pressure 15 Torr until a temperature of about 1400C was reached. Heating was maintained under these conditions until the weight of the residue became constant.25 g of a white solid residue were thus obtained, which was refluxed under stirring with 50 ml of ethanol.
