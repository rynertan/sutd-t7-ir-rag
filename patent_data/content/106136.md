# DIGITALLY CONTROLLED TRANSVERSAL EQUALIZER

## Abstract
An adaptive equalizer performs equalization at IF, de modulates the input signal and then generates the equaliza tion coefficients at baseband from the demodulated data. Coefficient updating can be done on a non real time basis and coefficients for individual bursts stored in a coefficient memory for retrieval when the same burst occurs in the next frame, thus obtaining a pseudo continuous equalization for each burst. In one embodiment, the error signal is derived from demodulated equalized data and correlated with de modulated unequalized data to generate the correlation coefficients, and individual error signals from each channel can be combined into a single composite error signal for correlation purposes.
