# Insulating joint for rubber or plastic insulated power cable.

## Abstract
In an insulating joint for a rubber or plastic insulated pow er cable, insulation shields 6 are formed around insulation layers 4 covering cable conductor 1 joint portions of adja cent cables so that the insulation shields 6 are longitudinally opposed to each other with a layer 7 with high dielectric con stant and high volume resistivity interposed therebetween. The layer 7 comprises a mixture consisting of 100 parts by weight of a rubber or plastic as a base, 50 to 700 parts by weight of one or both of silicon carbide or zinc oxide, and 2 to 60 parts by weight of carbon black.
