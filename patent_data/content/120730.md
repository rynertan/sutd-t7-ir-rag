# Fuel redistribution control for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A fuel redistribution control for an internal combustion engine 12 having a fuel control computer 10 and fuel deliv ery means 14 for delivering fuel to the engine in response to electrical signals. A signal generator 16 generating first signals indicative of the incremental rotational velocity of the engine s output member resulting from the torque impulses imparted to the output member by the individual cylinders, averaging means 18 for generating from said first signal an average rotational velocity signal, a circuit 20 for generating a difference signal indicative of the difference between said first signals and said average rotational velocity signal, integ rator means 22 for individually accumulating said difference signals to generate a correction signal for each cylinder, means for averaging said correction signal 26 to generate an average correction signal, means for summing 28 said cor rection signal with the base fuel quantity signals generated by the fuel control computer to generate intermediate fuel quan tity signals, and means for summing 30 the correction sign als to said intermediate fuel quantity signal to generate a corrected fuel quantity signal activating the fuel delivery means 14 to deliver a quantity of fuel to each cylinder tend ing to equalize the contribution of each cylinder to the total output torque of the engine.
