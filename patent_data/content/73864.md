# A process of reclaiming gypsum from plasterboard.

## Abstract
A process of reclaiming gypsum from plasterboard in which the plasterboard is broken up and then screened to obtain a fine fraction largely comprised of gypsum. The plasterboard is differentially ground in a hammermill having an opening discharge port to form a mixture of small sized particles of gypsum and substantially larger pieces of paper which is subsequently screened to obtain a fraction consist ing predominantly of gypsum.

## Description
DESCRIPTION A PROCESS OF RECLAIMING GYPSUM FROM PLASTERBOARD. The present invention relates to a process for use in the reclamation of gypsum from rejected plasterboard. In order to produce gypsum from plasterboard, it is necessary to separate the paperboard from the gypsum which is contained within the plasterboard. It is also possible to re use the gypsum and the paperboard together, provided the paperboard is reduced to pulp, to an extent where its re introduction can occur without disturbing the process. Existing processes can be classified according to these two principles. In one process, the plasterboard is dumped in a pulper, where the paperboard and the gypsum core are disintegrated to form a slurry. The slurry is then allowed to drain out and the remaining cake is added, in a small proportion,to the crude gypsum. In this process, the reclaimed material goes through the complete process of drying, grinding and calcination of the gypsum. In a typical dry process, the plasterboard is taken and subject tq crude breaking, e.g. by a tractor and rotavator, working on a large area of reject plasterboard, which is then screened. In this process, the reclamation efficiency is relatively low less than 80 and the separation of paper is very imperfect. The present invention is directed at an improvement of the process, whereby a higher proportion of gypsum is reclaimed than in prior reclamation processes the gypsum is ground to a particle size of which typically 20 will pass through a 100 mesh 150 Fun the reclaimed material has a free water content normally below 10 by weight although it may have an occasional maximum of 15 only a very small proportion of paper is entrained with the reclaimed gypsum the reclaimed gypsum can be introduced in the process just before the calcination stage, thereby avoiding drying and grinding, as well as several handling operations.The reclamation process is independent of prevailing weather conditions. According to the present invention there is provided a process of reclaiming gypsum from plasterboard in which the plasterboard is broken up and then screened to obtain a fine fraction largely comprised of gypsum characterized in that the plasterboard is differentially ground in a hammermill to form a mixture of small sized particles of gypsum and substantially larger pieces of paper which is subsequently screened to obtain a fraction consisting predominantly of gypsum. The grinding takes place in a hammermill, preferably of a type with a vertical shaft, equipped with pre breaker hammers in the feed opening, and several sets of hammers mounted one above the other on the vertical shaft. The number of hammers, their positions and sizes can be modified in a particular hammermill to suit the process. This type of hammermill is exemplified by the machines manufactured by Newell DunfordEngineering Ltd of Misterton, Doncaster, England and sold under the trade name Tollemache. Such a hammermill, especially when provided with an open discharge port, grinds differentially. The gypsum being friable, is ground to a small size and the paperboard remains as pieces which are many orders of magnitude larger in size than the particles of gypsum. The product from the hammermill is fed to a screen, the mesh of which is chosen such that the finely ground gypsum passes through the screen, and most of the paperboard reports as oversize. Both screening fractions are substantially free of the other component. The gypsum so treated is suitable to be fed directly into a calciner. Preferably, the reclaimed gypsum should be fed together with fresh material in a proportion of about 1 10 into a calciner for subsequent production into new plasterboard. In a typical installation the product from the hammermill outlet was screened through a screen having a 5 mm dimension. With such a screen 95 of the gypsum of the plasterboard fed to the hammermill was recovered contaminated by less than 3 paper. The free moisture content of the reclaimed material was between 0 and 15 depending upon the humidity of the waste plasterboard as fed to the hammermill. The product of the hammer mill comprised gypsum 60 of which had a particle size less than 250 pm and 95 of which had a particle size less than 1 mm, and paper 80 of which had a dimension greater than 5 mm and 50 of which had a dimension greater than 10 mm.
