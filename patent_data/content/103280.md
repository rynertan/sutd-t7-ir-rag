# Fabrication method of membrane structure.

## Abstract
A thin film 2 which becomes a membrane is formed over one major surface of a substrate 1 by plasma deposition pro cess utilizing microwave electron cyclotron resonance and then the substrate 1 is removed other than a portion 1A of the substrate 1 which remains as a frame so as to form a membrane structure. A dense and high quality membrane can be formed at a low temperature and the internal stress of the membrane is controlled by varying the conditions under which the plasma deposition process is carried out and by heat treat ing the thin film 2 after its formation.
