## Description
The present invention relates to a control circuit of a raster scanning display unit according to the preamble of claim 1. A control circuit of a display unit of this type is known is for example Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 60 22184. Let us describe here the control circuit with reference to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 is an illustration partly depicting a control circuit of a display unit. In the figure, designated at 1 is a CRT controller, 2 is a video memory for storing display data, and 3 is a parallel serial converter for converting paralled data to serial data, from which a VIDEO signal is delivered. Designated at 4 is a dot clock generator circuit with which the above described VIDEO signal is synchronized. Successively, let us describe a CRT controller 1 in detail. Designated at 101a, 101b, ...101h are a register, respectively, each of which holds a display start address. Likewise, designated at 102a, 102b, ...102h are a registr, respectively, each of which holds the number of rasters to be displayed. Designated at 103 and 104 are respectively a selector for outputting a desired one among a plurality of input signals, 105 is a counter for designating which input signal is outputted to the selecters 103 and 104, 106 is a counter for providing an address signal of a video memory 2, 107 is a counter for counting a raster signal, 108 is a counter for providing an address signal of the video memory 2, 109 is selector for providing an address signal of the video memory 2, 110 is a mode register for holding two modes of a write mode where display data is written in the video memory 2 and a read mode where display data is read from the video memory 2, 111 is a frequency divider for generating one pulse at every x dot clock with use of a dot clock provided from a dot clock generator circuit 4 as an input signal. An output signal from the frequency divider 111 is hereafter called an address clock in addition, x dot data is enterd into one address of the video memory 2 . Likewise, designated at 112 is a frequency divider for generating one pulse at each y address clock with use of an address clock provided from the frequency divider circuit 111 as an input signal. An output signal from the frequency divider 112 is hereafter called a raster clock in addition, x.y dot data is displayed per one raster . Let us then describe the control circuit so arranged with referencwe to Fig. 1 First, write operation into the video memory 2 will be described. To write display data of A, B,... H shown in Fig. 2 a into the video memory 2, a CPU not shown sets address data to the counter 108. An address being set here is a head address N1 of a write area. In addition, the CPU switches the mode register 110 to a write mode, An output signal from the counter is delivered to an address line 6 while the mode register 110 is operated in the write mode, and hence the above described head address is supplied to the video memory 2. Hereupon, display data is provided to a data line 8, while a write signal provided to a control line 7, both from a circuit not shown of the CRT controller 1. Finished write operation into one address, the counter 108 is incremented by 1 to permit the display data to be written into the next address. Written the display data 1 into the video memory 2 in such a manner, address data is again set to the counter 108. The address being set here is the head address N2 of the next writer area. Hereafter, display data B is likewise written into the video memory 2. Display data A, B,...H are written in succession into the video memory 2 in this way. In order to read any display data from the video memory 2 and display it as shown in Fig. 2, the CPU not shown sets display start addresses N1, N2, ...Nm to the registers 101a, 101b,...101h respectively. Moreover, raster numbers n1, n2, ..., nm to be displayed are set to be registers 102a, 102b,...102h. Furthermore, the counter 105 is reset to permit an output signal from the register 101a to be delivered from the selector 107, while an output signal from the register 102a to be delivered from the selector 104, and these outputs are set to the respective counters 106, 107, Thus, N, and n1 shown in Fig. 2 a are respectively set to the counters 106 and 107. In addition, the mode register 110 is switched to a read mode. An output signal from the counter 106 is delivered onto the address line while the mode register 110 is operated in the read mode. Hereupon , a read signal is provided onto the control line 7 from the circuit not shown of the CRT controller 1. Any display data is hereby read from the video memory 2, and delivered onto the data line 8. The above data is converted to serial data through the parallel serial converter 3 to provide a VIDEO signal. Issued one address display data x dot from the parallel serial converter 3 as the VIDEO signal, the frequency divider 111 provides one pulse. Hereby, the counter 106 is incremented by 1. Thus, any display data is read from the next address N1 1 of the video memory 2. Read in such a way display data x.y dot corresponding to one raster from the video memory 2, the counter 107 is decremented by 1. When the value of the counter 107 gets 0 read operation for the display data A of Fig. 2 a is finished , the counter 105 is incremented by 1, whereby an output signal from the register 101b is delivered from the selector 103, while an output signal from the register 102b delivered from the selector 104, both output signals are respectively set to the counters 106, 107. Accordingly, N2 and n2 of Fig. 2 a are respectively set to the counters 106 and 107. Thereafter, the display data B is read in the same manner from the video memory 2. Display data on and after B are also likewise read. As a result, a plurality of the independent display informations A, B,.. H can be displayed on a signal display screen at the same time. Document GB 21 44 952 A describes a multiwindow display circuit of a raster scanning display unit. It comprises a picture information memory, conventional address counters for generating a read address of the picture information memory in synchronism with an address clock and an address converter provided between the picture information memory and the address counters. The address converter includes a judging part for judging whether or not the area concerned is a window where a superposed display is effected. Bias registers are provided for storing a difference between a head storage address of superposing display data and a head storage address of superposed display data. Further a full adder for adding an output signal from bias registers to an output signal from said address counter is provided. It is the object of the present invention to provide a control circuit capable of displaying single display information while permitting it to be superposed on another independent display information. This object is solved by the control circuit according to claim 1.

In the figure, designated at 55 and 56 are selectors, and 57, 58, 59 and 60 are counters, for which one corresponding to TI made SN 74163 for example is employed. In addition, the counters 57 and 58 comprise a combination of a prescribed number of counters. Designated at 61, 62, 63, and 64 are inverters, 65, 66 are two input NOR gates, 67 is a three input AND gate, 68 is a selector, 69 is an adder, 70 is a register which holds a difference Nb1 Na1 between the Nb1 and Na1 of Fig. 5 b , HL is a high level signal, and SYNC is a vertical synchronization signal of the display unit, DATA is a data signal from a CPU not shown , CLK1 is the raster clock being an output signal from the frequency divider circuit 112 of Fig. 1 CLK2 is the address clock being an output signal from the frequency divider circuit 111 of Fig. 1, MDISP is a signal to instruct displays to be superposed, which is availabel from the CPU not shown, ADD is an output signal from the selector 109 of Fig. 1, and VADD is an address signal of the video memory 2. Then, operation of the address converting part 5 will be described. In Fig. 9, designated at 500 is an address converting part, and 501,502, 503, and 504 are respectively registers. These registers serve to hold address information of the video memory 2. Let us describe here the address information with reference to Fig.10. Fig. 10 a shows a display state on the screen, while Fig. 10 b a storage state of display data in the video memory 2. In the figures, designated at A is an area to display the display data A , B1 is an area to display the display data B1 , H is an area to display the display data H Na is a head address of the area having the display data A stored therein, Nb is likewise a head address of the area having the display data B stored therein, Na1 is a head address of the area where superposed display is effected, Na2 is a final address of a first raster of the area where superposed display is effected, Na3 is a final address of the area where superposed display is effected, and Nb1 is a head address of the area where the superposing display data B1 is stored.The register 501 holds the above address Na1, while the register 502 holds the next address Na3 1 of the above address Na3. Likewise, the register 503 holds the next address Na2 1 of the above address Na2, while the register 504 holds the difference Nb1 Na1 between the Nb1 and Na1 similarly with the register 70 of Fig. 4. Let us here again describe Fig. 9. Designated at 505 is a register for holding an address clock number of the raster of the display data A of Fig. 10 b , 506, 507, 508 and 509 are respectively a comparator, 510, 511, and 512 are a selector, 513, 514, and 515 are an adder, 516, 517 are a register, 518, 519 are a latch, and 520 is a three input AND gate having the same function as that of the three input gate 67 of Fig. 4. Then, operation of the address converting part 500 will be described. The MDISP signal is set to 1 to effect the superposed display. Moreover, the Na1, Na3, Na2, Nb1 Na1, and y are respectively set to the registers 501, 502, 503, 504, and 505. Started the display, the Na1 and Na2 are respectively set to the registers 516, 517 in synchronism with the CLK2 raster clock . This is done every time the CLK2 arrives. Then, the latch 518 has been reset, and the selectors 510, 511 has allowed output signals from the resisters 501, 503 to pass therethrough. Changed the ADD signal to the Na1, a coincidence signal is delivered from the comparator 506 to set the latch 518, whereby a signal 1 is provided from the latch 518. In addition, a coincidence signal is delivered also from the comparator 508 to set the latch 519, whereby a signal 1 is provided from the latch 519. Hereby, the selector 512 allows an output signal from the adder 515 to pass there through, whereby the VADD signal gets Nb1 to permit the display data B1 to be displayed on the display area B1. Changed the ADD signal to Na2 1, a coincidence signal is issued from the comparator 509 to reset the latch 519 whereby a signal 0 is delivered from the latch 519. Accordingly, an output signal from the three input AND gate 520 gets 0 . Hereby, the selector 512 allows the ADD signal to pass therethrough, whereby the VADD signal is changed to Na2 1, and hence the display data A is again displayed. Finished the display of one raster, the CLK2 is supplied to the registers 516, 517. Hereby, an output signal Na1 y from the adder 514 is set to the register 517. In addition, when the latch 18 has been set, the selectors 510, 511 respectively allow the output signals from the adders 513, 514 to pass therethrough. Changed there the add signal to Na1 y , the latch 519 is again set to permit the display data B1 to be displayed. While, changed the ADD signal to With the above operation being repeated, the ADD signal finally gets Na3 1. Thereupon, a coincidence signal is issued from the comparator 507 to reset the latch 518. Hereby, the display data A is displayed on the display area A thereafter. In succession, a movement, a smooth movement in particular, in the display information will be described,
