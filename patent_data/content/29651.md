## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PROPYLENE ETHYLENE BLOCK COPOLYMER The present invention relates to a process for producing a propylene ethylene block copolymer.More particularly, it relates to an improved process for producing a hetero block copolymer in which an ethylene propylene random copolymer is bonded to a polypropylene main chain. It is know that a hetero block copolymer can be produced by a two stage polymerization comprising a first stage in which propylene is polymerized in a diluent such as an inert liquid hydrocarbon in the presence of a catalyst comprising titanium trichloride and an organoaluminum compound such as Ziegler Natta catalyst and a second stage in which ethylene and propylene are random copolymerized in the presence of the propylene homopolymer. The titanium trichlorides used by these conventinal processes have been obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound or a metallic aluminum or further heat treating and pulverizing the product, and are usually of the type known as TiC13 AA. When these titanium trichlorides are used, the polymerization does not proceed satisfactorily and yields a high proportion of noncrystalline polymers as by products. It is not possible to provide satisfactorily high productivity for a given amount of catalyst because of the low polymerization activity. Therefore, it is necessary to separate catalyst residues from the polymer by dissolving the catalyst residues in a diluent for example by treating a slurry of the polymer with an alcohol, and separating the polymer from the diluent after the polymerization.The non crystalline by products are preferably removed from the polymer product because the high rigidity which is one of the important characteristics of polypropylene is lowered by the non crystalline polymers. The amount of the non crystalline polymers increases in the copolymerization of propylene ethylene block copolymers.This causes a decrease in yield of the desired polymer and also the adhesion of rubber like polymer to the inner wall of the reactor and the aggregation of particles of the polymer which clogs pipes and other parts of the apparatus so that it is difficult to carry out a steady continuous process. Further processes are required for separating and recovering the alcohol used for the separation of the catalyst residues and the non crystalline polymers from the diluent, which increases costs. The advantageous physical characteristics of the block copolymers are remarkably improved impact strength and lack of brittleness at low temperature without any substantial decrease of the high rigidity characteristic of a propylene homopolymer. As shown in Japanese Examined Patent PublicationNo 31119 1972, the impact strength is improved by increasing the ratio of propylene to ethylene in the second stage the copolymerization . However, the formation of the non crystalline polymer is also increased. Only 80 to 90 of the desired block copolymer is usually recovered from the diluent solution of the polymers. It has been proposed to decrease a formation of the non crystalline polymers and a process in which a crystalline propylene polymer is produced at a ratio of more than 90 by weight based on the total polymers in the first stage is disclosed in Japanese Examined PatentPublication No. 1836 1964. Such a process, forming an ethylene propylene random copolymer at a relatively low ratio in the second stage offers little improvement in the impact strength of the resulting block copolymer. It has been proposed to increase the concentrations of the monomers used, that is, to use liquid propylene as the monomer instead of an inert liquid hydrocarbon as a diluent in order to increase the productivity of the polymer for a given amount of the catalyst. In such a process, the productivity of the polymer per unit of catalyst can be increased. However, it is still not high enough because the polymerization activities are not high when using the conventional titanium trichloride which is obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with metallic aluminum and which has a formula of TiC13.1 3 AlC13 so called TiC13 AA . As is disclosed in Japanese Examined Patent Publication Nos 32414 1971, the productivity of the polymer is only about 5 kg, per 1 g. of titanium trichloride. Moreover, it is difficult to increase the content of ethylene component in the ethylene propylene random copolymer since the random copolymerization of ethylene and propylene is carried out in the liquid propylene as one of the comonomers. Various processes for increasing the content of the ethylene component have been proposed. For example, inJapanese Examined Patent Publication No. 10116 1978, a random copolymerization of ethylene and propylene is carried out at a low temperature of 45.6 to 23.9 0C 50 to 750F in the second stage, to increase the content of the ethylene component. When the copolymerization is carried out at such low temperatures, the polymerization velocity is remarkably low and special cooling apparatus is needed to maintain the reactor at low temperature.This is uneconomical and impractical for an industrial operation. In Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 32414 1971, the vapor phase is discharged from the reactor and a new vapor phase is fed into the reactor in the random copolymerization of ethylene and propylene in the second stage to increase the content of the ethylene component.In this process a compressor for recycling the vapor phase is needed. The inventors have sought to develop an industrial process for a block copolymerization in liquid propylene in a main stage to increase the content of ethylene component in the ethylene propylene random copolymer formed in the second stage. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a propylene ethylene block copolymer which has excellent powdery characteristics, in which the formation of non crystalline polymers is minimized and the separation of a catalyst residue is simplified or eliminated, by using a specific catalyst having high catalytic activity. It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a propylene ethylene block copolymer which has excellent characteristics such as high rigidity, high impact strength, low brittle point temperature and good surface characteristics texture of surface when melt extruded, by selecting the concentrations of propylene in the vapor phase in the two stages and using hydrogen as a molecular weight regulating agent in both stages. The present invention provides a process for producing a propylene ethylene block copolymer in the presence of a catalytic system essentially comprising an organoaluminum compound and a sossd titanium trichloride catalytic complex at an atomic ratio of Al to Ti of less than 0.15 1, and including a complexing agent, tun two stages of polymerization as follows a a first stage in which propylene is polymerized in the presence of a liquid propylene and hydrogen to produce a propylene homopolymer having a melt flow index of 1 to 150 at a ratio of 70 to 95 by weight based on the total polymers and b a second stage in which the polypropylene from stage a is copolymerized with propylene and ethylene in the presence of hydrogen and liquid propylene at a concentration of propylene in the vapor phase, based on the total of propylene and ethylene in the vapor phase, of 50 to 85 mol e and at a concentration of hydrogen in the vapor phase, based on the total of propylene and ehtylene in the vapor phase, of 0.5 to 30 mol to produce an ethylene propylene copolymer having a melt flow index of 10 7 to 0.1 at a ratio of 5 to 30 by weight based on the total of polymers. The so3idtitanium trichloride catalytic complex used as a catalyst in the present invention has an atomic ratio of Al to Ti of less than 0.15 1, preferably less than 0.1 1 and especially less than 0.02 1 and includes a complexing agent. The complexing agent is usually incorporated at a molar ratio of more than 0.001, preferably more than 0.01 based on TiC13 in the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex. Preferably it comprises titanium trichloride and an aluminum halide having the formula AIR pX3 p R represents a C1 C20 hydrocarbon moiety and X represents a halogen atom and 0 p 2 at an atomic ratio of Al to Ti of less than 0. 15 and the complexing agent at a molar ratio of more than 0. 001 based on a total of the aluminum halide and titanium trichloride.For example, it is shown by the formula TiCl3 AIR pX3 p x C x y wherein R3 represents a C1 C20 hydrocarbon moiety X represents a halogen atom 0 p 2 C represents a chelating agent x is less than 0. 15 and y is more than 0. 001. It is possible to incorporate a small amount of iodine, a compound formed by substituting a part or whole of chlorine atom of titanium trichloride with iodine or bromine a inorganic carrier made of MgCl2 or MgO polyolefin powder such as polypropylene beside TiCl3 component, AIR pX3 p component and the complexing agent C. Suitable complexing agents C include ethers1 thioethers, ketones, carboxylic esters1 amines, carboxylic amides, and polysiloxanes. The ethers and thioethers are especially preferable.The ethers and thioethers are particularly compounds having the formula R4 o R5 or R4 S R5 wherein R4 and R5 respectively represent hydrocarbon moieties having 15 or less of carbon atoms. The particular compounds are shown in below. The typical compounds of AIR pX3 p include AlCl3 and AlR3Cl2. The solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex used in the process of the present invention is preferably a compound which has halo having the maximum intensity at the position corresponding to the peak position of then type titanium trichloride 28 about 32. 9 C in its X ray diffraction. Moreover, it is preferably the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex produced without heating at a temperature of higher than 150 C. Furthermore, it is preferably to use the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex having integrated micropore volume of more than 0.02 cm g. especially from 0.03 to 0.15 cm g.on pore radii of 20 to 500 measured by a mercury porosimeter which has fine micropores and a specific integrated micropore volume.whereby a separation of non crystalline polymers can be eliminated. The solid titanium trichloride catalytic complexes can be easily produced by the following processes a it is precipitated from a solution of titanium trichloride component dissolved with the ether or the thioether at a temperature of lower than 1500C or b it is obtained by treatments of a solid titanium trichloride obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound and a metallic aluminum1 by using a complexing agent and a halide. The process a is known. The solution of titanium trichloride component can be obtained by the following processes A a process for reducing titanium tetrachloride as the starting material with an organic aluminum in the presence of the ether or the thioether if desired with a desired hydrocarbon or B a process for treating a solid titanium trichloride as the starting material with the ether or the thioether if desired1 with a desired hydrocarbon. The ethers and thioethers are described above and preferably the compounds having the above indentified formula R4 O R5 or R S R5 wherein R4 and R5 respectively represents an alkyl group preferably a straight alkyl group such as ethyl1 n propyl, n butyl, n amyl, n hexyl, n heptyl, n octyl, n decyl and n dodecyl group an alkenyl group preferably a straight alkenyl group such as butenyl and octenyl group a aryl group such as tolyl, xylyl and ethylphenyl group and an aralkyl group such as benzyl group. The optimum ethers and thioethers include dialkyl ethers, dialkenyl ethers, alkyl alkenyl ethers and dialkyl thioethers. Suitable hydrocarbon solvents include saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n pentane, n hexane, n heptane, n octane, n dodecane, and liquid paraffin alicyclic hydrocarbon such as cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene. This is mainly selected depending upon the kind of the ether. For example, when the ether or thioether having a C3 C5 alkyl or alkenyl group as at least one of R4 and R5 of the formula is used, an aromatic hydrocarbon is preferably selected or an alicyclic hydrocarbon can be selected. when the ether or thioether having an alkyl or alkenyl group having 6 or more carbon atoms as R4 and R5 of the formula is used, a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon is preferably selected. The organoaluminum compound used in the process A can be the compounds having the formula AlR6X q 3 q 6 R6 represents a C1 C20 hydrocarbon moiety q is 1 to 3 X represents a halogen atom . The organoaluminum compound is used at a molar ratio of Ti in titanium tetrachloride to the hydrocarbon moiety R6 in the organoaluminum compound of 1 0. 1 to 1 50 preferably 1 0. 3 to 1 10. The ether or thioether is used at a molar ratio of ether to titanium tetrachloride of 1 0. 05 to 1 5 preferably 1 0. 25 to 1 2. 5.The reduction is not critical. The three components are mixed in a desired order at a temperature of 0 to about 50 C to form the solution. When a small amount of iodine, titanium tetraiodide or titanium tetrabromide is incorporated at a molar ratio of about 0. 005 to 0. 3 based on titanium tetrachloride, the precipitated solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex has remarkably high catalytic activity to produce a polymer having high isotactic property. The solid titanium trichloride used in the process B can be titanium trichloride obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with hydrogen gas or aluminum preferably titanium trichloride obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound. The ether or thioether is usually used at a molar ratio of titanium trichloride to the ether or thioether of 1 1 or more preferably 1 1 to 5. The treatment with the ether or thioether is usually carried out at 0 to 100eC preferably about 20 to 50CC. In the process a , the fine solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex is precipitated from the solution of the titanium trichloride component dissolved in the process A or B at a temperature of 150 C or lower. The process is not critical. The solution is heated, if desired after admixing with a hydrocarbon diluent, at a temperature of lower than 150 C usually 20 to 150 C preferably 40 to 120 C especially 60 to 100 C to precipitate it. When the molar ratio of a total of Ti component and Al component to the ether or thioether in the solution of titanium trichloride component is less than 1, the precipitation can be promoted by adding a liberating agent i. e. a precipitating agent.The precipitating agent can be compounds having a function for precipitating a solid titanium trichloride by reacting with the ether or thioether component which is complexed to titanium trichloride in the solution, for example, Lewis acids having acidity of higher than that of titanium trichloride, such as titanium tetrachloride, boron trifluoride, boron trichloride, vanadium tetrachloride, aluminum trichloride, alkylaluminum dihalide, alkylaluminum sesquihalide, and dialkylaluminum halide. It is optimum to use titanium tetrachloride1 aluminum halides such as aluminum trihalides, and alkylaluminum dihalides. The precipitating agent is preferably used at a ratio of less than 5 mole times of Ti component in the solution. The process b is known and will be described in detail. Titanium tetrachloride is reduced with an organoaluminum compound or a metallic aluminum. The organoaluminum compound can be the compounds having the formula shown in the process A for the process a . The reduction can be carried out by the known process. When titanium tetrachloride is reduced with the organoaluminum compound, the organoaluminum compound is added to a diluent at a molar ratio of more than 1 preferably 1 to 10 based on titanium tetrachloride at a temperature of about 50 C to 30 C and heated to a temperature of 10 to 100 C to complete the reaction. When a metallic aluminum is used for the reduction, the metallic aluminum is added to titanium tetrachloride in a diluent such as xylene at a ratio of 0. 1 to 1 g. atom of the metallic aluminum to 1 mol. of titanium tetrachloride with a small amount of AlC13 with or without a diluent such as xylene and the mixture is heated to 80 to 300 C preferably 100 to 200 C. In the process b , the resulting solid titanium trichloride is treated with a complexing agent and with a halide. The complexing agent can be the above mentioned compoundsC. The halides can be titanium tetrachloride and carbon tetrachloride.The treatment with the complexing agent and the halide can be simultaneously carried out or sequentially carried out such as the halide treatment followed by the complexing treatment. The complexing treatment is usually carried out by adding the complexing agent at a molar ratio of 0. 2 to 3 based on TiC13, to the solid titanium trichloride in the diluent at a temperature of 20 to 80 C. After the complexing treatment, the solid is preferably separated and washed.The treatment with a halide is usually carried out in a diluent at a temperature of 10 to 500C. The halide is usually used at a molar ratio of 0. 1 to 10 preferably 1 to 5 based on TiC13. After the treatment with the halide, the resulting solid product is preferably separated and washed. The solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex used in the process of the present invention is preferably produced by the process a or b . In order to produce the catalytic complex having the specific integrated micropore volume, it is preferably produced by the process a especially the process a with the process A . Beside the processes a and b , it is possible to produce the catalytic complex by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound and adding the ether at a molar ratio of 0. 5 to 5 to the resulting solid titanium trichloride and heating it at 50 to 1500C and separating the solid product as disclosed in JapaneseUnexamined Patent Publication No. 123796 1976. In the process of the present invention, the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex is used as the catalyst. It is not suitable to use, as the catalyst, the pure titanium trichloride TiC13 obtained by a hydrogen reduction of titanium tetrachloride, titanium trichloride aluminum trichloride eutectic crystal TiC13 1 3 All3 obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with aluminum or mechanically pulverized titanium trichloride. The organoaluminum compound as the cocatalyst is preferably the compound having the formula MR1 Cl n 3 n R1 represents a C1 C20 hydrocarbon moiety n is 1.95 to 2. 10 . It is possible to use diethylaluminum monochloride having ethyl group as R1 and 2 of n. Thus, it is preferably to use the compounds having n propyl group or n hexyl group as R1. When R1 is n propyl or n hexyl group, it is important that n is in a range of 1. 95ins2. 10.When the specific organoaluminum compound is combined with the solid titanium catalytic complex, a polymerization activity is remarkably high and an isotactic property is remarkably high.When the organoaluminum compound having n 2. 10 is combined, the isotactic property is inferior though the polymerization activity is superior. When the organoaluminum compound having n l. 95 is combined, the polymerization activity is inferior though the isotactic property is superior. Both of them are not preferable. The organoaluminum compound as the cocatalyst can be the mixture of the compounds having n propyl group and n hexyl group as R1 The organoaluminum compounds used as the cocatalyst can be produced by the known processes, for example1 a reaction of aluminum tri chloride with tri n propylaluminum or tir n hexylaluminum or a reaction of a compound having the formula A1R C1 2 R represents n propyl or n hexyl group and O m 3 with tri npropylaluminum, tri n hexylaluminum or aluminum trichloride.It is also possible to combine these processes by reacting aluminum trichloride with tri n propylaluminum or tri n hexylaluminum to produce the compound having the formula A1.R2 Cl m 3 m m is about 0. 9 to 2. 1 and then, reacting it with a small amount of tri n propylaluminum, tri n hexylaluminum or aluminum trichloride to produce the compound having a desired value of n. The reaction temperature is in a range of the ambient temperature to 150 C preferably 50 to 100 C and a reaction time is in a range of several min. to several hr. preferably 1 to 2 hr.The reaction can be carried out without any medium. It is possible to react them in a desired medium such as aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n hexane and n heptane aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane and methyl cyclohexane. When a mixture of trialkylaluminums having the different 2 alkyl group in AIR5mCl3 m is used as the reagent for the second reaction, a mixture of compounds having n hexyl group and n propyl group are obtatained. After the reaction, the product can be used as the cocatalyst however, it is preferably used after a purification by a distillation under a reduced pressure. In the process of the present invention, an electron donor as the third component beside the catalyst and the cocatalyst whereby the isotactic property of the polymer can be improved without lowering the polymerization activity. The electron donors can be compounds having one or more electron donor atom or group such as ethers, polyethers, alkyleneoxides, fur an, amines, trialkylphosphines, triarylphosphines, pyridines, quinolines, phosphoric esters, phosphoric aides, phosphineoxide s, trialkylphosphite, triaryipho sphite s, ketone s, carboxylic esters and carboxylic amides. It is preferable to use carboxylic esters such as ethyl benzoate, methyl benzoate and phenyl acetate glycine esters such as dimethylglycine ethyl ester and dimethylglycine phenyl ester and tri arylphosphites such as triphenylphosphite and trinonylphosphite etc. As ratios of the catalyst components, a molar ratio of TiC13 in the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex to the organoaluminum compound is in a range of 1 1 to 100 preferably 1 2 to 40. When the third component is used, a molar ratio of TiC13 to the third component is in a range of 1 0.01 to 10 preferably 1 0. OS to 2. Aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene can be used as the third component for the catalyst. The solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex used as the catalyst1 can be use without any treatment, and it is preferable to use it after a pretreatment with a small amount of an olefin such as propylene and ethylene in the presence of an organoaluminum compound. The pretreatment is effective for improving physical properties of a slurry of the polymer such as a bulk density. The temperature in the pretreatment is lower than the polymerization temperature and is usually in a range of 20 to 600C. The pretreatment is carried out to provide a ratio of the polymer produced by the pretreatment to TiC13 in the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex of 0. 1 to 50 1 by weight preferably 1 to 20 1 by weight. In the process of the present invention, the production of a propylene ethylene copolymer with the catalyst system comprising the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex and the organoaluminum compound, is carried out in three stages. In the first stage, a homopolymerization of propylene is carried out in the presence of liquid propylene. It is preferable to use an inert liquid hydrocarbon such as aliphalic hydrocarbons such as hexane and heptane alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane and aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene to charge the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex and the organoaluminum compound into the reactor. A small amount of the inert liquid hydrocarbon can be incorporated with the liquid propylene.The polymerization temperature and time are selected so as to give 70 to 90 by weight of propylene homopolymer in the total amount of the polymers. The polymerization temperature is usually in arange of 40 to 1000C preferably 55 to 800C.The polymerization pressure is a sum of a vapor pressure of the liquid propylene, a pressure of hydrogen as the molecular weight regulating agent1 and a vapor pressure of the inert liquid hydrocarbon used as the diluent for the catalyst components and it is usually in a 2 range of 30 to 40 kg. cm . A polymerization temperature and an amount of the molecular weight regulating agent arc selected to produce the propylene homopolymer having a melt flow index of 1 to 60 in the first stage. The melt flow index is measured by ASTM D1238 70 as a rate of extrusion g. 10 min. at 230 C under a pressure of 2. 16 kg. and is referred to as MFI. The molecular weigh regulating agent can be hydrogen and dialkyl zinc etc. preferably hydrogen.A concentration of hydrogen in the vapor phase is usually in a range of about 1 to 20 mol . In the second stage, a random copolymerization of propylene and ethylene is carried out in the presence of the propylene homopolymer obtained in the first stage and liquid propylene. A concentration of propylene in the vapor phase is in a range of 50 to 85 mol which is the condition for forming non crystalline polymers at highest ratio, but the condition for improving an impart strength of the final product in the highest level. In such condition, the powdery block copolymer having high bulk density and high free fluidity can be obtained without substantially adhereing on the inner wall of the reactor in the present invention. When the concentration of propylene in the vapor phase is more than 85 mol 1 especially more than 95 mol O o, or less than 50 mol O o, an improvement of the impact strength is not satisfactory. When the polymerization is carried out in a concentration of propylene in the vapor phase of 50 to 85 mol , a content of propylene component in the resulting random copolymer of propylene and ethylene is in a range of 30 to 70 by weight 22 to 61 mol . The polymerization temperature and time are selected to produce the random copolymer of propylene and ethylene at a ratio of 3 to 20 by weight of the total of the polymers. When it is less than 3 by weight, the improvement for impact strength is not enough high.When it is more than 20 by weight1 a bulk density and a free fluidity of the powder are deteriorated to give lower rigidity and tansparency and to give a large shrinkage of a molded product.The ratio of the polymer in the second stage is preferably smallest among those of the polymers in the first, second and third stages.The polymerization temperature is usually selected from the range of 30 to 70 C preferably 40 to 60 C. The polymerization pressure is a sum of the vapor pressure of the liquid propylene, the pressures of hydrogen and ethylene and the vapor pressure of the inert liquid hydrocarbon at the polymerization temperature and is usually in a range 2 of 20 to 40 kg. cm . The content of hydrogen as the molecular weight regulating agent and the polymerization temperature are selected so as to produce a random copolymer of propylene and ethylene havingMFI of lower than 0. 1. When MFI is higher than 0. 1, the improvement of the impact strength is not satisfactory. The concentration of hydrogen in the vapor phase is usually in a range of 0. 01 to 10 mol . As described above, when hydrogen is not present1 shark skin surface is formed on the molded product. In the third stage, a random copolymerization of ethylene and propylene is carried out in the presence of the propylene ethylene copolymer obtained in the second stage in the presence of liquid propylene or in the absence of liquid hydrocarbon such as liquid propylene. The polymerization in the presence of liquid propylene can be carried out by a conventional slurry polymerization process.The polymerization in the absence liquid hydrocarbons such as liquid propylene and inert hydrocarbon liquid medium is carried out by a gas phase polymerization in which ethylene and propylene gases directly contact with the catalyst. The concentration of propylene in the vapor phase is lower than that of the second stage and lower than 75 mol preferably lower than 50 mol , especially 10 to 50 mol . When the concentration of propylene in the vapor phase is higher than 75 mol OJo, physical properties of the object polymer can not be improved and the bulk density of the powdery copolymer is lowered and the aggregation of particles of the polymer is caused.On the other hand1 when the concentration of propylene is higher than 10 mol , the operation can be continued without removing propylene after the second stage without decreasing excellent physical properties of the polymer as that of zero mol . The polymerization temperature and pressure and time are selected so as to produce 5 to 20 by weight of the propylene ethylene random copolymer having ethylene component as the major component based on the total of the polymers in the third stage. When it is less than 5 by weight, the improvement of brittleness at low temperature is not enough high. When it is more than 20 by weight1 transparency of a molded product is inferior.The polymerization temperature is usually in a range of 0 to 100 C and preferably 60 to 90 C in the gas phase polymerization and 20 to 50 C in the slurry polymerization in the liquid propylene. 2The polymerization pressure is usually in a range of 1 to 50 kg. cm The polymerization temperature and the concentration of hydrogen as the molecular weight regulating agent are selected to produce the propylene ethylene random copolymer having MFI of less than 1 preferably less than 0. 1. The concentration of hydrogen in the vapor phase is usually in a range of 1 to 150 mol in the gas phase polymerization and in a range of 0. 01 to 30 mol in the slurry polymerization in liquid propylene. When MFI is more than 1, the effect for improving the impact strength is not enough high. The polymerization can be carried out by a continuous system or a batch system. In the continuous system different reactors are used for the polymerizations in the stages. The transferring of the slurry of the polymer between the reactors is preferably carried out under a pressure difference or a head difference. The polymerization pressures in the reactors in the stages are preferably selected to be the order of 1st stage 2nd stage 3rd stage. The pressure in the first or second stages can be increased by charging an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The propylene ethylene block copolymer obtained by the process of the present invention has high crystallinity with a smaller formation of non crystalline polymers and accordingly, it is unnecessary to remove the non crystalline polymers. The block copolymer product has excellent impact strength and rigidity and brittleness at low temperature even though the non crystalline polymers are not removed. A productivity of the propylene ethylene block copolymer is more than 16000 g. especially more than 22000 g. per 1 g. of Ti Cl3 of the catalyst. Therefore, the catalyst residue of TiC13 remained in the block copolymer product is less than 19 ppm especially less than 14 ppm as Ti. It is unnecessary to remove the titanium component.After the polymerization in the third stage, the powdery propylene ethylene block copolymer has a powder having excellent free fluidity. It is unnecessary to remove the non crystalline polymers and the Ti component of the catalyst residue whereby it is unnecessary to use an inert liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol. After the polymerizations, the powdery block copolymer can be used by itself in the gas phase polymerization. All of liquid propylene is vaporized or the block copolymer is separated by a precipitation and then liquid propylene is vaporized in the slurry polymerization in liquid propylene. That is, the powdery copolymer is obtained without substantially washing it. This can be directly pelletized or pelletized after a simple treatment contacting a small amount of a gaseous alkyleneoxide with the powdery copolymer at 80 to 1200C for several min. as disclosed in Japanese Unexamined PatentPublication No. 25888 1977 so as to remove chlorine in the catalyst residue. The powdery copolymer can be used as the powder grade product without any pelletization. In a continuous stable operation for a long time by the process of the present invention, the powdery characteristics of the powdery copolymer containing the catalyst residue in the polymerization system should be a bulk density of more than 0. 35 g. cm3 preferably d. 40 g. cm at 30 to 1300C and a repose angle of 30 to 50 preferably 30 to 45 and a slip angle of 25 to 50 preferably 25 to 43 and an average particle diameter of more than 100,f preferably more than 200fit. In order to produce the powdery copolymer1 the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex obtained by the process a or b especially the process a can be used. The repose angle and the slip angle can be measured on a ground stainless steel plate as the angle for maintaining the stable state and the angle for initiating the slippage as described in ShinKagaku Kogaku Koza published by Nikkan Kogyo News Paper Co.Vol. 18 page 5 to 8.

The autoclave was heated. When the temperature in the autoclave reached to 70 C, 5 mB. of a slurry of the solid titanium trichloride catalytic complex obtained by Preparation ofCatalyst 1, 18 mg. as TiC13 in toluene was charged under nitrogen gas pressure.

Hydrogen gas was fed at a pressure of 0.5 kg. cm2 into the autoclave and 500 g. of liquid propylene was fed. The temperature in the autoclave was controlled at 50OC and ethylene gas was fed at a pressure of 7.0 kg. cm2. This time was considered to be the initiation of the polymerization in the second stage.

Then, the polymerization in the third stage was carried out as follows. After the second stage, the liquid propylene, ethylene gas and hydrogen gas were purged to be a pressure of zero kg. cm2 gauge and then, hydrogen gas was fed at a pressure of 1. 5 kg. cm2 and 500 g. of the liquid propylene was fed and the temperature in an autoclave was controlled to be 300 C and ethylene gas was fed at a partial pressure of 12.5 kg. cm2. This time was considered to be the initiation of the polymerization in the third stage. The polymerization was continued at 300C for 0.83 hr. with stirring. During the polymerization, ethylene gas was continuously fed to maintain an ethylene partial pressure of 12.5 kg. cmê. The total pressure was 27,5 kg. cmê gauge . A concentration of propylene in the vapor phase was an average of 46 mol and a concentration of hydrogen was an average of 6 mol .After 0.83 hr., the liquid propyleneethylene gas and hydrogen gas were purged, and 390 g. of white powdery propylene ethylene block copolymer having excellent free fluidity without any aggregated mass was obtained from the autoclave. The conditions for polymerizations and the results of various measurements are shown in Table 6. The powdery copolymer had a bulk density f B of 0.43 g. cc and I.I.of 94.7 . These values were slightly lower than the values of the propylene homopolymer sampled after the first stage as f B of 0.46 g. cc and 1.1. of 96. 6 . The powdery copolymer had an average particle diameter of 360 At and a repose angle of 37e and a slip angle of 36 . On the other hand, in physical characteristics, a first yield strength and an Izod impact strength of the product were remarkably high even though non crystalline polymers were not separated. A brittle temperature was remarkably low. A tensile impact strenght was 816 kg.cm cmê. A catalytic efficiency CE was 21,700.A Ti content remained in the copolymer was low enough to be 14 ppm which need not be separated. EXAMPLES 12 to 14 In accordance with the process of Example 11 except varying the conditions for polymerizations in the second stage and the third stage as shown in Table 6 polymerizations were carried out to obtain a propylene ethylene block copolymer.
