## Description
LOW DENSITY PHOSPHATE BONDED SPINEL REFRACTORIES AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION The present invention concerns magnesium aluminum oxide spinel compositions for use as a light weight casting mold and thermal insulation that has high structural strength and resistance to chemical attack. The following patents and literature references represent some aspects of the general field of magnesium aluminum oxide spinels used in mortars, castables and coatings and the like employing phosphorous acids as a reactive component. U.S. Patent 3,730,744, employing fuzed magnesium aluminate, discloses an aggregate in cast shapes employing Al H2PO4 3 as the bonding solution which contains alkalizing ions as the curing agents.U.S. Patent 3,285,758 teaches ammonium phosphate in combination with aluminum phosphate plus MgO calcined dolomite where spinel is mentioned as an aggregate.U.S. Patent 4,341,561 teaches the production of foamed refractories using hydraulic cements, some of which also contain phosphate materials. U. S. Patent 4,459,156 discloses that a reactive spinel may be one of the components of the mortar. The use of a non reactive gas autogenerated compound is not disclosed. A fundamental review of phosphate bonding is found in J. AMER. CERAMIC SOCIETY, Vol. 133, No. 8,August 1, 1950 by William David Kingery. Another review is found in Ceramic Bulletin, Vol. 56, No. 7, page 640 by J.E. Cassidy 1977 . Other studies are as follows Ceramic Bulletin, Vol 59, No. 7 1980 byFrancisco J. Gonzales and John W. Halloran, Reaction of Orthophosphoric Acid with Several Forms of AluminumOxide and an abstract of a Russian Scientific paper authored by L. B. Khoroshavin, V. A. Ryabin, I. E.Sipeiko, V. N. Naumov, G. A. Sychev, V. Ya. Pavlov, V.M. Chyrin, N. F. Serenko, B. V. Ponomarev, and E. P.Kosolapova, Eastern Institute of Refractories, UralScientific Research Institute of Chemistry, Perm ChemicalPlant, All Union Scientific Research Institute for thePower Supply in Nonferrous Metallurgy, from Ogneupory,No. 3, pp. 34 36, March, 1977 translated . The above two review articles, the one byKingery covering the art to 1949 and the other byCassidy from 1949 1977 form a very complete picture of the state of technology on phosphate bonding.Materials listed as forming phosphate bonds with phosphoric acid are Tit2, CaO, FeO, Fe203, NiO, ZnO, Zr02, MgO, Al2O3, and Cr03. These may be reacted as pure compounds or as constituents in mineral compositions, i.e., asbestos, bauxite or clay. The most common bonding mechanism using phosphoric acid is the reaction with alumina to form A1 H2PO4 3, which is also the starting material in many formulations in place ofH3PO4. Al H2P04 3 further reacts with either alumina, clay or bauxite, resulting in orthophosphates MgHPO4.3H20 or AlH3 PO4 2 as the bond. In the H3PO4 A1203 system addition of Mg 2, Foe 3 or Be 2 ions increase bonding strength but these ions also contribute to premature setting. The patent literature very closely follows the above literature review that is, while it teaches phosphate bonded systems, it only mentions spinel as one possible aggregate material. Also these aggregates are not reactive with any activity observed due to free MgO and are typically part of the coarse grained portion with very few fines material 325 mesh . In accordance with the present invention, effective compositions can be produced to serve as thermal insulation which have high structural strength and resistance to chemical attack. These compositions can be used to produce monolithic insulating installations or insulating shapes. The ingredients for producing the present compositions are a a reactive MgAl204 spinel or spinels, b optionally, non reactive fillers, c a non reactive gas autogenerating compound means of introducing void volume d aluminum acid phosphate moieties and or phosphoric acid, e water, and f optionally, handling agents. The present invention includes a castable composition which is particularly usable in the metals industry for construction and repair of low density br insulating structures, linings and component parts, for example, in melting furnaces, electrolytic metal winning cells, component parts for metal casting machines, including transfer pipes, troughs, and the like, as well as low density refractory structures in the chemical and petrochemical industry. The present invention concerns compositions comprising a 10 to 80 percent by weight of a reactive MgAl2O4 spinel or mixture of reactive MgAl2O4 spinels which have been calcined to different temperatures and prepared by coprecipitating water soluble magnesium and aluminum salts in a proportion to provide about I magnesium atom per 2 aluminum atoms b preferably,, from 0 to 50 per cent by weight of a substantiallv non reactive filler c a non reactive gas autogenerated from 1 to 40 percent by weight of a compound which decomposes under acidic conditions and generates gas within said composition d 1 to 20 percent by weight of an inorganic phosphorous compound which forms PO3 3 moieties on heating at above about 2000C e 8 to 40 percent by weight of water and f preferably, from 0 to 5 per cent by weight of handling agents. The MgAl204 spinels of owFonent a are preferably prepared in accordance with the teachings ofU.S. Patent 4,400,431. Such spinels have been calcined and may be sintered to at least about 16000C.The preferred spinel is a mixture where one MgAl2O4 spinel has been calcined to about 9000C and the other spinel at about 16000C. When only one spinel is present, preferably the spinel has been calcined to l6000C. The non reactive filler ofomFonent b is typically highly sintered such as tabular alumina, fused grain alumina, fused grain spinel MgAl204 , highly sintered MgAl204 for example as made in accordance with U.S.U.S. Patent 4,400,431 , as well as other fused grain materials such as ZrSiO4. The non reactive gas forming compound decomposes on contact with the acidic component and generates gas to produce bubbles, which serve as void volume to reduce the fired density and give the product an insulating character, and is preferably a CO2 producing agent. The C02 producing agent may be any acid decomposable carbonate such as dolomite or magnesium carbonate.While other alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonates may be employed they introduce components which may degrade the physical properties of the casting. One way to avoid these problems is to use a MgA1 HC03 OH x y to balance positive valence compound prepared in accordance with U.S. Patent 4,400,431. Preferred compounds are dolomite and MgA1 OH 4 5 HC03 0.5. The inorganic phosphorous compound of component d should be capable of forming PO3 3 moieties on heating, i.e. on drying out of the formulation, at above about 2000C. Preferred phosphorous compounds are A1 H2P04 3 and H3PO4. Water is employed component e as necessary to give workability to the binder composition, as are handling agents including modifiers component f . Total water content usually employed is from about 8 to about 40 weight percent of the total composition. Handling agents, including set modifiers, component f suitable for use herein include activated alumina, fumed alumina Al2Os , glycerine, polyvinyl alcohol, MgO, Mg OH 2, MgO MgAlz04 mixtures or mixtures of two or more, employed in from 0 to about 5 weight percent of the total composition. Other well known handling agents may be employed. In the following examples, unless otherwise denoted, the reactive MgAl204 spinet is derived from a coprecipitation process in which a mixture of magnesium aluminum hydroxides Mg AlY OH Z and aluminum hydrox xy ides and or aluminum oxyhydroxides are produced and thereafter calcined to between about 7000C and about 16500C. The magnesium aluminum hydroxide phase represented above may contain other anions partially substi tuting for hydroxide e.g. Cl , NO3 , SO4 , CO3 , the presence and amount of which will be determined by the type of reactant salts used in the coprecipitation and the type and duration of subsequent treatments, chemical or thermal, to which the precipitate phase has been subjected.The precipitate of magnesium aluminum and aluminum hydroxy compounds is referred to as spinel precursor. The overall Al Mg ratio with this mixture will be very nearly 2.0, unless otherwise noted. .If this ratio significantly deviates from 2.0 e.g. 1.90 or 2.10 segregated MgO and or Alp03 phases are normally observed in the calcined or sintered product and these can affect reactivity. The A1 H2PO4 3, H3PO4, fused grain A1203, fumed alumina, porous alumina, and fibrous alumina are all commercially available, substantially pure compounds and or solutions. The sintered spinels may be commercially available fused grain material or a highly sintered, above 16500C , spinel prepared in accordance with U.S. Patent 4,400,431. Formulations may consist of two main parts.The binder phase, produced by reacting an acidic phosphate species with at least one active oxide species, is the first part. The aggregate phase, which contains the CO2 producing agent, is the second part. The binder phase is often prepared out prior to the addition of the aggregate or filler material which latter component s may be inert, as in the case of fused grain, tabular, or fibrous A1203, or highly sintered 16500C MgAl204, or may have some degree of reactivity, as in the case of MgAl2O4 sintered to 51650 C or calcined A1203. This activity is due to changes in surface area, degree of crystalline perfection and or population of surface hydroxyls available for reaction.EXAMPLE 1 Magnesium aluminum spinel, 7.6 g, calcined at 9000C and sized to pass through a U.S. standard 100 mesh seive was suspended in a solution of 11.8 g.A1 H2PO4 3 in 13.2 grams 1120. 11.0 g. of spinel sintered at c16000C was added and the slurry set aside. In a separate container 75 grams of a mixture produced by ball milling 30 g of dolomite MgCa CO3 2 together with 100 grams of magnesium aluminum spinel sintered at s16000C was slurried in 20 grams 1120. The two slurries are mixed and immediately react, with CO2 gas being generated by the action of the acidic aluminum phosphate on the dolomite. The product expands by a factor of 2 in volume, and sets in about 4 minutes. After firing, it has a density of 0.66 g cm3 41 lb ft3 . This material is especially useful as a back up refractory foamed in place to fill unusual, irregular, or difficult to access spaces.EXAMPLE 2 Magnesium aluminum spinel, 120 grams, calcined at 16000C was mixed with 40 grams sintered A1203 then added to a solution of 35 grams of 85 H3PO4 and 10 grams water. Thereafter 50 grams of Mg2Al3 OH 4.5 HCO3 0.5 was slurried in 60 grams of water. The two slurries were mixed and the volume doubled. The mixture set in about 4 minutes. The above compositions are preferably fired to a temperature of at least 2000C.
