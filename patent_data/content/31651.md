# Process for the preparation of 4,1 ,6 trichloro 4,1 ,6 trideoxy galactosucrose.

## Abstract
4,1 ,6 trichloro 4,1 ,6 trideoxygalactosucrose is pre pared by a process including the steps of a isomerising 2,3,4,3 ,4 penta O acetyl sucrose to 2,3,6 3 ,4 penta O acetyl sucrose b chlorinating the isomerised acetate at the 4,1 and 6 positions and c deacetylating the resulting chlorinated product the isomerisation step a being effected by treating a solution of 2,3,4,3 ,4 penta O acetyl sucrose in an inert solvent with a weak acid at an elevated temperature.
