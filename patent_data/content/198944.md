# Scanning acoustic microscope.

## Abstract
The scanning acoustic microscope comprises a solid lens body 1 consisting of two sections 2, 5 of materials having different sound propagation characteristics but matching acoustic impedances. A lens 4 is arranged at the interface 3 of said sections 2, 5 having its focal point falling into the apex 8 of a sharply pointed tip 7 formed at the free surface of one 5 of the sections. Tip 7 and specimen 10 to be investigated are immersed in a coupling medium 9 having a relatively high absorption coefficient. The lens body 1 carries a transducer 11 on its surface 6 opposite the tip 7 for sending plane sound waves through said lens 4 and said tip 7 onto the specimen 10 . The reflected and transmitted waves are received by the trans ducer 11 attached to the lens body 1 and a transducer 21 arranged on the rear side of the specimen, respectively. By appropriate processing of their output signals, high resolution 10 nm images of the specimen 10 can be obtained.
