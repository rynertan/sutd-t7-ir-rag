# System for subsurface neutron logging.

## Abstract
A radioactive borehole logging system includes a pulsed neutron source, a neutron counter 10 , a filter 11 around the counter to absorb thermal neutrons and a moderator 12 between the counter and the filter to optimize epithermal neutron die away. The system may also include a second filter 13 between the counter and the moderator to absorb neut rons that have reached thermal equilibrium.
