## Description
HEEtPLATt STRUCTURE PARTICULARLY FOR SKI BOOTS Tbis invention relates to a heelplate structure particularly for ski boots. It is known to use, for protecting the heel region of the sole of a ski boot, a heelplate piece which is usually formed of a rubber or the like material block accommodated in a recess defined in the bottom rear region of a boot heel. In conformity with a currently utilized technique such a rubber heelplate would be fastened by means of one or more screws of a non rust material. Thus, with such prior solutions, when the user is to replace a worn out heelplate, he she is required to remove the screws in order to release the heelplate for replacement with a new one. This operation, while being simple per se, must be carried out, however, with some skill in order to avoid damaging the screw hole threads, since any damage would result in an unreliable attachment of the new heelplate. Furthermore, loosening two or more screws may be difficult where the screw heads are worn, and even where such an operation appears to be simple to carry out, it is inconvenient for the user. It is the aim of this invention to obviate such prior disadvantage by providing a heelplate structure which can be attached to a ski boot without resorting to the use of screws or the like fasteners. Within the above aim, it is a particular object of the invention to provide a heelplate structure which, while including a much simplified fastening means, can give full assurance of a firm and durable fit of the heelplate to the ski boot. It is another object of this invention to provide a heelplate structure which is simpler to manufacture and of moderate cost. The above aim, as well as these and other objects such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a heelplate structure particularly for ski boots, according to the invention, comprising a heelplate block receivable in a recess formed in the bottom rear region of the heel of a ski boot, characterized in that it comprises interlocking means for removably securing said heelplate block in said recess. Further features and advantages will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description of a heelplate structure particularly for ski boots, as illustrated by way of example and not of limitation in the accompanying drawing, where Figure 1 is a longitudinal cross section of the heelplate according to the invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the heelplate block and Figure 3 is a longitudinal cross section of the heelplate according to a further embodiment of the invention in which the male interlocking means is fitted to the ski boot. With reference to the drawing views, a heelplate structure particularly for ski boots, according to the invention, comprises a heelplate block, generally designated with the reference numeral 1, which is advantageously formed from rubber or the like materials. The heelplate block 1 is receivable, in a conventional fashion, in a recess 2 defined in the bottom rear portion of the heel 4 of a ski boot. A unique feature of the invention is that an interlocking means is provided for removably securing said heelplate block 1 in the recess 2. In a preferred embodiment, such interlocking means consists of a mushroom shaped element, generally designated with the reference numeral 10, including a stem 11 with an enlarged head 12 which is formed peripherally with a conical taper 14 adapted for insertion into a throughgoing hole 20 provided in the cited recess 2 and open to a depression 21 within the ski boot which will receive the head 12 such that it cannot protrude inwards and provide an abutment for engagement with the head. In an equally useful embodiment, the mushroomshaped element, indicated at 10 , is provided directly in the recess 2, thereby the heelplate block will be formed with a throughgoing hole 13 through which the stem 11 can be inserted whereto an enlarged head 12 having a frusto conical taper 14 is attached, which head is received in a depression 21 defined in the heelplate block 1 and forming the abutment for the enlarged head 12 . With the arrangement described above, the heel plate block can be pressed in place directly without using screw fasteners. To replace the heelplate, it will be sufficient to remove the heelplate block by prying it out with a screwdriver or equivalent tool inserted between the recess and heelplate block, thus practically dislodging the worn heelplate, and then insert a new heelplate block into the same position with a pressing action. It will be appreciated that the rubber material of the heelplate block is advantageously more elastically deformable than the material of the heel or sole, which is advantageously plastic material.Thereby the snapping in action and the replacement is facilitated. It may be appreciated from the foregoing discussion that the invention achieves its objects, and in particular that a heelplate structure is provided which has a greatly simplified construction and can be readily assembled without involving any complex or troublesome operations. In practicing the invention, any suitable material, dimension, and contingent shape, may be used to meet individual requirement.
