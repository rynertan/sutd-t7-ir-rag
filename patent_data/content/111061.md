# Closure system for laminated plastic bags.

## Abstract
A laminated plastic bag has the opening edges 2 closing automatically by downward folding, when a pull is exerted on the handle consisting of a cord 6 . In such a way the goods contained in the bag are protected from external agents in a practical and efficient manner, with a closure system which is simple and cheap.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1 Closure system for laminated plastic bags, characterized by the fact that the upper opening edges 2 of the bag are automatically closed being folded downwardly, when a pull is exerted on the handle consisting of a cord 6 . 2 Closure system according to Claim 1, characterized by the fact the cord 6 is threaded into two pairs of eyelets 4,5 provided at the two side ends of the bag dnd has a knot 7 at its ends to prevent unthreading, the upper eyelet 4 being applied on the opening edge 2 and the lower eyelet 5 being applied on the bag body 1 . 3 Closure system according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized by the fact that the cord 6 is short to be used just as a handle. 4 Closure system according to Claims l and 2, characterized by the fact that the cord 6 is longer to be used as a shoulder belt 5 Closure system according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized by the fact that the two opening edges 2 are reinforced with two bands 3 of stiffer laminated plastics which, besides stiffening the closure zone of the bag, make it stable by creating a folding line 8 between opening and body of the bag. 6 Closure system according to Claim 5, characterized by the fact that the reinforcing bands 3 are provided with mutual engagement means such as pressure buttons. 7 Closure system according to Claim 2, characterized by the fact that the lower eyelet 5 holds between the two foils of the bag body 1 , a piece 9 of rigid reinforcement.

## Description
CLOSURE SYSTEM FOR LAMINATED PLASTIC BAGS The present invention relates to a closure system for laminated plastic bags, used by shops, supermarkets, department stores for delivering goods sold to the costumers, such as articles bf clothing, textile fabric pieces, food and so forth. The bags presently available on the market, are generally lacking of a closure at the opening, so that the goods contained in them are exposed to all troubles such as stains, dirt, dust and last but not least rain or snow. Other known bags have a particular closure, consisting of the so called pressure buttons applied on the plastic handle with which the bag is normally provided, but also this solution does not close entirely the bag, and therefore does not preserve from the above mentioned troubles and moreover tends to open if the bag contains goods of a certain weight. The present invention removes these drawbacks and provides for a bag of simple structure, low cost and highly practical use, having a satisfactory and efficient closure system at its opening. The closure system for laminated plastic bags according to the present invention is characterized by the fact that the upper edges of the bag opening are automatically closed being folded downwardly, when a pull is exerted on the handle consisting of a cord. The characteristics, objects and advantages of the system according to the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment, given as a non limiting example only and made with reference to the figures of the annexed sheet of diagrammatic and merely illustrative drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a partial perspective view of the bag in an open condition Fig. 2 is a view of the bag with the opening in a closed condition and Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view showing the structural features of the bag opening and its closure system. With reference now to the figures of the accompanying drawings, the laminated plastic bag at each side end has a pair of eyelets, of which the upper eyelet 4 is applied on the opening edge 2 while the lower eyelet 5 is applied on the body 1 of the bag, the ends of a grasping cord 6 being introduced in said eyelets, said cord 6 having a terminal knot 7 to prevent its unthreading. Under the weight of the goods introduced in the bag, the cord or handle 6 slides by gravity force in the lower eyelet 5 so as to pull the knot end 7 and cause the opening edge 2 to be folded down, as it is clearly shown in Fig. 2. In order that the bag remains somewhat stiff at the opening, and to improve closure and seal of the bag, more particulalry at the central part of the two closure edges, the bag opening may be provided with two reinforcing bands 3 of a rigid plastic material, glued or anyhow fixed on the inner or outer face of the two opening edges 2. The reinforcing bands 3 may also be provided with elements for mutual engagement, such as pressure buttons. This feature, besides stiffening the opening edges, makes closure easier by creating a critical zone or folding line 8, at the same time improving also the appearance of the article. Between the two foils of the bag body 1, gripped by the lower eyelet 5, a piece 9 of rigid reinforcement may also be provided. The handle 6 consists, as already indicated, of a cord made of cotton or other suitable material and of any desired colour, and such a cord may be either short so as to be used just as a handle, or longer so as to be used as a shoulder belt.
