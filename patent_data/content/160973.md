# Method for making roofing plates.

## Abstract
A sloping roof structure comprises a supporting struc ture 72 and a plurality of elastically flexible, outwardly convexly curved roofing plates 74 mounted thereon. The roofing plates are mounted in a partly overlapping rela tionship so that the lower rim portion of each plate overlaps the upper rim portion of an adjacent lower plate. Each roofing plate is fastened to the supporting structure by means of nails 75 , screws or other fastening means at a portion intermediate of the upper and lower rim portions of the plate. The initially curved plate is fixed in an at least partly flattened condition, whereby the upper and lower rim portions are resiliently pressed against the supporting structure 72 and the outer surface of the adjacent lower plate, respectively. The curved roofing plates 74 for such a roof structure may be made from a layer 37 of a plastic, deformable material, such as a cement mixture which may be reinforced by fibers. This layer of material may be placed on a curved supporting surface 70 so that the layer of material attains a shape similar to that of the supporting surface. The layer of material may then be hardened or set while supported by the curved supporting surface.
