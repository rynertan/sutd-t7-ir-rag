# A HAMMER CONTROL DEVICE FOR A BAND PRINTER

## Abstract
A hammer control system for a band printer has a micro processor 12 receiving character information and having an address ADR and a data bus BUS output together with a timing output. The microprocessor controls an optioning scheme used in the printer. A decoder 16 is connected with the address output of the microprocessor and a print line buffer 20 provides a stored print data output for subsequent comparison and printing connected with said decoder. A compare circuit 22 receives the output of the print line buffer and receives data from the microprocessor. A shift register 28 receives a compare signal from the compare circuit and a shift control signal from the microp rocessor. A hammer driver device 30 causes printing to occur in response to the output of the shift register.
