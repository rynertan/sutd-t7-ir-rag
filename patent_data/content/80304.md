# Stabilization of oxidase.

## Abstract
An oxidase selected from the group consisting of glycerol 3 phosphate oxidase, choline oxidase and glucose oxidase can be stabilized by adding thereto an acidic amino acid or a salt thereof. The resulting stabilized composition can be used for quantita tively determining the content of glycerol 3 phosphate, choline, triglyceride, glucose, etc., in a biological fluid.
