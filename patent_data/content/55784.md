# CONTROL DEVICE FOR INDEXING INTERMITTENT ROTOR.

## Abstract
A control device for indexing an intermittent rotor for the turret of an NC lathe or the like, which comprises code signal generator means LS1, LS2, LS4, LS8, DG for generating a different code signal at each stopping position of the rotor TR , strobe signal generator means LSS, DG for generating a code signal reading strobe signal at each stopping position of the rotor TR , a first comparator circuit COMP1 for comparing the indexing instruction value with the code signal, a counter CT for counting the strobe signals and preset by the code signal, and a second comparator circuit COMP2 for comparing the counted value of the counter CT with the code signal value. When a coincidence is detected by both comparators COMP1, COMP2 , an index ing complete signal is generated thereby controlling the indexing of the rotor with high reliability.
