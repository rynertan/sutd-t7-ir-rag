# Liquid crystal display.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal display 1 operable in both ambient and artificially lighted modes includes an optically clear plate 3 , a translucent plate 5 , transparent character forming elec trodes 11, 13 formed on facing portions of the plates 3, 5 , and a liquid crystal material 9 sandwiched between the plates 3, 5 . The translucent plate 5 is backlighted by an artificial illumination source 19 when ambient light is insufficient for viewing of the display 1 . The translucent plate 5 is preferably formed from a material, such as milk glass, which is nonreactive with the liquid crystal material 9 . The translucent plate 5 has a relatively smooth surface which acts as a diffuse reflector of ambient light, while transmitting diffuse artificial lighting when the display 1 is backlit. Since ambient light is reflected only from the upper surface of the translucent plate 5 which is substantially coplanar with the active portion of the display 1 , viewing problems due to parallax are eliminated and character contrast is enhanced.
