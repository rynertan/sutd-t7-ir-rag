# MULTIPLE VARIABLE CONTAINER PACKAGE

## Abstract
A container package comprises a plurality of individual containers 20, 22 which each have a hollow polygonal body from which an elongated hollow neck 48 extends. Each hollow body 20,22 has side walls, a bottom wall and a top shoulder wall. A recess is provided in one of the side walls for receiving the neck 48 of an adjacent container 20 22 in the package. The containers 20,22 are mated together and form a polyhedron. The containers 20,22 have interior volumes which are different from each other so that the containers 20,22 contain different amounts of materials or have indentical volumes but be shaped differently from each other. At least one of the recesses contains at least one secondary container 60 61 which, together with a neck 48 of another container 20,22 , substantially fill the recess.
