# Fire retarding resin composition and fire retardant composition.

## Abstract
A fire retarding resin composition composed of a a thermoplastic resin, b about 20 to about 60 by weight, based on the total weight of a , b and c , of a magnesium hydroxide powder whose surface is treated with an alkali metal oleate, and c about 0.1 to about 10 by weight, based on the total weight of a , b and c , of at least one fatty acid metal salt selected from the group consisting of magnesium oleate and aluminum oleate and a fire retardant composition for thermoplastic resins, said composition comprising b a magnesium hydroxide powder whose surface is treated with an alkali metal oleate, and c at least one fatty acid metal salt selected from the group consisting of magnesium oleate and aluminum oleate, the weight ratio of b to c being from 2 to 600.
