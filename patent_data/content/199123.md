## Description
The present invention relates to a display controller for controlling a liquid crystal display device, a cathode ray tube hereinafter referred to as CRT display device or the like. There has been proposed a display controller which allows a display device such as a liquid crystal display device or a CRT display device to display various images under the control of a central processing unit hereinafter referred to as CPU . Various types of display controllers have been developed and used for a variety of purposes. In the case where a CRT display device is used as a display device, the display of an image on a screen thereof is conducted in an interlace or a non interlace method, whereas, in the case of a dot type liquid crystal display unit being used, the display screen is divided into the upper half and the lower half display blocks, and the display is conducted by simultaneously scanning the both halves. In either of the above cases, display of a cursor is conducted by, for example, storing dot data representative of the cursor pattern in a video RAM, and changing the position of the dot data in the video RAM in accordance with a cursor position information. In another known cursor displaying method, a cursor signal is generated such that a cursor in the form of an underline is displayed immediately below the corresponding character displayed on the screen. The first mentioned method is used mainly in a graphic display mode, while the second mentioned method is used in a character display mode. The first mentioned method relying upon the changing of position of the dot data in a video RAM, however, suffers from a problem that the CPU has to conduct a complicated data processing for the changing of position of the dot data, whereas, in the second mentioned method making use of an underline, the shape and display position of the cursor are limited undesirably. A display controller capable of controlling both of a CRT display device and a liquid crystal display device would be very helpful. However, such a display controller has not yet been developed, because both types of display devices adopt different scanning methods as explained before. Such a display controller adaptable to both types of display devices, even if such a device is available, would require different methods for designating coordinates of a cursor position for both display devices. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a display controller which permits display of a cursor in any desired form and at any desired position on the screen, without burdening the CPU. Another object of the invention is to provide a display controller which can cause a cursor to be displayed on a screen of either of a CRT display device and a multi display block type liquid crystal display device, while enabling designation of coordinates of the cursor position in the same method both for the CRT display device and the liquid crystal display device.

The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment when the same is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which One embodiment of the present invention will be described hereunder in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, a display controller 10 provided in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention displays various kinds of dot patterns on a screen of a CRT display device 11a or a liquid crystal display device 11b shown in Fig. 2, by effecting data exchange with a CPU 12 Fig. 1 which is an external device to the controller 10. The screen of the liquid crystal display device 11b is constituted by an upper display block A and a lower display block B. A memory 13 Fig. 1 stores data and various programs to be executed by the CPU 12. Each of the constituent elements of the display controller 10 will be explained below in detail. A pulse generator 14 generates a train of dot clock pulses Ø, the period of which corresponds to the time required to display each dot on the display screen. The dot clock pulses Ø are supplied to a horizontal counter 15 Fig. 1 , parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 Fig. 1 and a display control circuit 18 Fig. 2 . The horizontal counter 15 counts the dot clock pulses Ø to provide a count output H which indicates a current horizontal scanning position on the display screen. The count output H of the counter 15 is supplied to both of the display control circuit 18 and a comparator 19 Fig. 1 . The maximum count of the horizontal counter 15 is set to a value equal to the total number of dots displayed in one horizontal line or row of dots on the display screen, and the counter 15 repeatedly effects the count operation within a count range between the initial value and the maximum value. When the count output H of the counter 15 returns from the maximum value to the initial value, it supplies a pulse signal P₁ to a vertical counter 20. In consequence, a content output V of this vertical counter 20 represents a vertical scanning position on the display screen. A count range of this vertical counter 20 is changed in accordance with a display device selection signal L C supplied to a terminal T₁. The count output V of the vertical counter 20 is delivered both to one of input terminals of an adder 21 and the display control circuit 18. The other input terminal of the adder 21 is supplied with a fixed data 100 decimal or 0 through a gate 22 which is controlled by a signal UD. This signal UD is a pulse signal produced by the display control circuit 18 when the signal L C indicate that the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, and becomes 0 level and 1 level, respectively, when the scanning point is on the upper half A and lower half B of the liquid crystal display screen. When the CRT display 11a is used, the signal UD is not generated, i. e., the level of this signal UD is always 0 . The comparator 19 compares the count output H with data held in a register 23. If these values coincide with each other, the comparator 19 supplies a coincidence detection pulse P₂ to one input terminal of an AND gate AN₁. In this case, the data held in the register 23 represents X coordinate of a cursor 24, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, the data being written into the register 23 by the CPU 12. Similarly, data representing Y coordinate of the cursor 24 is written into a register 25 by the CPU 12. The data in the register 25 is delivered to an adder 26 through inverters INV. The X and Y coordinates of the cursor 24 can be set in the same way for both the liquid crystal display device 11b and the CRT display device 11a. The manner of setting X and Y coordinates of the cursor 24 for each of the CRT display device 11a and the liquid crystal display device 11b will now described. Referring first to Fig. 3 showing the screen of the CRT display device 11a, the origin 0, 0 of the coordinates is set at the left upper corner of the the display screen. The X coordinate is represented by an offset in the right hand direction from the origin 0, 0 , while the Y coordinate is represented by the downward offset from the origin. Referring now to Fig. 4 illustrating the screen of the liquid crystal display device 11b, the display screen is divided into two blocks, namely, the upper display block A and the lower display block B. Each of the blocks A and B is constituted by a 640 100 dot matrix as illustrated. When the cursor 24 is located at a position PS1, the X and Y coordinates are given as 2, 1 , whereas, when the cursor 24 is located at a position PS2, the X and Y coordinates thereof are given as 2, 101 . Thus, when the liquid crystal display 11b is used, the X and Y coordinates of the cursor 24 are designated such that the two display blocks A and B constitute in combination a single screen. Thus, the designation of the coordinate positions of the cursor 24 on the screen of the liquid crystal display device 11b can be made in the same way as that used for the CRT display device 11a. It will be seen that the position of the cursor 24 is represented by the position of the upper left corner dot thereof. In Fig. 1, a carry input terminal Ci of the adder 26 is always supplied with a 1 signal. Thus, the adder 26 carries out addition of the two s complement of the data held in the register 25 to an output data AV of the adder 21. In other words, the adder 26 acts so as to subtract the data in the register 25 from the data AV. Higher order output terminals of the adder 26 are respectively connected to input terminals of a NOR gate NOR₁, and a carry output terminal Co of the adder 26 is connected to a remaining input terminal of the NOR gate NOR₁ through an inverter INV₁. An output terminal of the NOR gate NOR₁ is connected to the other input terminal of the AND gate AN₁, and an output terminal of this AND gate AN₁ is connected to one input terminals of OR gates OR₅ and OR₆ and to a reset terminal R of an RS flip flop 27. An output signal of the NOR gate NOR₁ is supplied as a cursor display enable signal EN to various gates which will be mentioned later. Cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 are 8 32 bit memories for respectively storing cursor patterns PT1 and PT2 having configurations different from each other, the patterns PT1 and PT2 being written into the memories 28 and 29 by the CPU 12. The pattern PT2 is smaller than the pattern PT1, so that the pattern PT2 is superimposed on the pattern PT1 when displayed on the screen. Figs. 5 a and 5 b respectively show examples of the patterns PT1 and PT2. Areas e₁ and e₂ surrounded by broken lines in Figs. 5 a and 5 b represent memory areas of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29, respectively. The numerals on the both sides of each of the memory areas e₁ and e₂ represent memory addresses thereof in decimal. In this case, the pattern PT1 is a square pattern composed of 16 16 dots, while the pattern PT2 is displayed on the screen as a square pattern composed of 10 10 dots. Hatched portions of the areas e₁ and e₂ represent the respective cursor patterns and are stored with 1 bits. In actual display, these patterns PT1 and PT2 are superimposed one upon the other, as shown in Fig. 5 c . Address input terminals AD₄ to AD₁ of each of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 are connected respectively to the lower bit four bits output terminals of the adder 26, and address input terminals AD₀ thereof are connected to an output terminal Q of the flip flop 27. And therefore, the memories 28 and 29 are accessed by the four lower order output bits of the adder 26 and the signal outputted from the Q terminal of the flip flop 27 simultaneously. However, when the patterns PT2 and PT1 are written by the CPU 12, the addressing of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 is controlled by the CPU 12. The parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 store 8 bit parallel data read respectively from cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 thereinto when a signal outputted from the OR gate OR₅ rises, while when the signal falls or decays, the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 begin to shift out the stored data from respective output terminals So thereof in accordance with the dot clock pulses Ø. The output terminals So of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are directly connected respectively to the highest bit stages thereof, and therefore, when the parallel data is loaded onto each of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17, the highest order bit of each of the parallel data is outputted at the time of the loading thereof. A serial output of the parallel to serial converter 16 is fed through an AND gate AN₃ back to an input terminal Si thereof when the signal EN is in the 0 state, while when the signal EN is in the state of 1 , the serial output is fed through an AND gate AN₄ to one input terminal of a NAND gate NAN₁ as a cursor pattern signal CPS₁. Similarly, a serial output of the parallel to serial converter 17 is fed through an AND gate AN₅ to an input terminal Si thereof when the signal EN is in the 0 state, while when the signal EN is in the state of 1 , the serial output is fed through an AND gate AN₆ to one input terminal of an AND gate AN₂ as a cursor pattern signal CPS₂. In Fig. 1, an eight bit shift register 30 is adapted to shift, in accordance with the clock signal Ø, data supplied to an input terminal Si thereof. An output signal from the shift register 30 is fed back to the input terminal Si through an AND gate AN₈ and an OR gate OR₆ when the signal EN is in the 0 state. On the other hand, when the signal EN is in the 1 state, the output signal of the shift register 30 is fed through an AND gate AN₇ to a set terminal S of the flip flop 27 and to the other input terminal of the OR gate OR₅. A video memory 40 fig. 2 stores four bit color codes each representative of a color of a respective one of the display dots provided on the entire screen. In the case of the liquid crystal display device 11b being used, the video memory 40 stores data each representing gray scale of a respective one of the display dots in place of the color codes. In the illustrated embodiment, color codes corresponding to eight display dots are read from the video memory 40 by each reading operation. For example, the video memory 40 comprises four memory devices connected to one another in parallel, each of which stores 8 bit data in each address, so that 32 bit data is read out at once from the same addresses of the four memory devices. The color codes are read from and written into the video memory 40 by the display control circuit 18. The relationship between the color codes and the colors of the displayed dots is shown in Fig. 6. In Fig. 6, symbols RD, GD and BD respectively represent color data obtained by decoding the color codes and constitute luminance information of red, green and blue colors. The decoding is conducted by a color palette 41 shown in Fig. 2. The display control circuit 18 is arranged so as to recognize the current scanning position on the display screen, in accordance with the dot clock pulses Ø, count output H, count output V and the adder output data AV. The display control circuit 18 is also arranged so as to read the color codes corresponding to the current scanning position from the video memory 40. The reading processing effected by the circuit 18 when the CRT display device 11a is used is different from that effected when the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, as will be understood from the following description. When the CRT display device 11a is used, the scanning is performed from the upper end towards the lower end of the display screen. Therefore, color codes for eight dots are successively read as the scanning proceeds, and each of the thus read color codes are outputted on a one dot or four bit unit basis at a speed determined by the dot clock Ø. This processing is repeatedly carried out as the scanning proceeds. A processing different from that explained above is effected when the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, because in such a case the both display blocks A and B see Fig. 4 are scanned simultaneously or in parallel. In this case, the color codes corresponding to the 0th to 7th dots on the first horizontal scanning line in the display block A are read first, and then the color codes corresponding to 0th to 7th dots on the first horizontal scanning line in the display block B are read. Subsequently, the color codes corresponding to the 8th to 15th dots on the first scanning line of the display block A are read. In this manner, th color codes for the display blocks A and B are alternately read on an eight dot unit basis. The color codes thus read out are outputted from the display control circuit 18 dot by dot at a speed which is twice as high as that of the dot clock pulse Ø. Thus, color codes for eight consecutive dots in the display block A and color codes for eight consecutive dots in the display block B are outputted alternately. This reading operation will be more fully described later. When the CRT display device 11a is used, the display control circuit 18 outputs a horizontal synchronization signal HSYNC and a vertical synchronization signal VSYNC to the CRT display device 11a in accordance with the count outputs H and V. When the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, the display control circuit 18 outputs various timing signals to the liquid crystal display device 11b in accordance with the count outputs H and V. The display control circuit 18 is also arranged so as to rewrite the color codes in the video memory 40 in accordance with various commands delivered from the CPU Respective bits of each of the four bit color codes outputted from the display control circuit 18 are supplied to one input terminals of four AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃. This display controller 10 further comprises a 2 bit register 46, a 4 bit register 47 and a 4 bit register 48 whose contents are changed by the CPU 12. Bit data D₀ and D₁ outputted from the register 46 are supplied to the other or second input terminals of the NAND gate NAN₁ and the AND gate AN₂, respectively. Four bit data D₀ to D₃ outputted from the register 47 are supplied to one input terminals of four OR gates OR₀ to OR₃, respectively, and similarly, four bit data D₀ to D₃ outputted from the register 48 are supplied to one input terminals of four AND gates AN₂₀ to AN₂₃, respectively. An output terminal of the NAND gate NAN₁ is connected to all of the other input terminals of the OR gates OR₀ to OR₃, and an output terminal of the AND gate AN₂ is connected to all of the other input terminals of the AND gates AN₂ iO to AN₂₃. Each of the registers 47 and 48 are written with a color code by the CPU 12, which color code is used in a logical operation as later described. Output terminals of the OR gates OR₀ to OR₃ are connected respectively to the other input terminals of the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃, and output terminals of the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ are connected respectively to one input terminals of four exclusive OR gates EXOR₁₀ to EXOR₁₃. Further, output terminals of the AND gates AN₂₀ to AN₂₃ are connected respectively to the other input terminals of the exclusive OR gates EXOR₁₀ to EXOR₁₃, and output signals from the exclusive OR gates EXOR₁₀ to EXOR₁₃ are supplied as a color code to input terminals of the color palette 41, wherein the supplied color code is converted into the color data RD, GD and BD. The color data RD, GD and BD outputted from the color palette 41 are passed through digital to analog converters DAC₅₀ to DAC₅₂ so as to be outputted as analog color signals R, G and B, respectively. These digital to analog converters DAC₅₀ to DAC₅₂ are used only when the CRT display device 11a is used. The color data RD, GD and BD are also supplied to a luminance computing circuit 53. The luminance computing circuit 53 produces a luminance or an intensity data YD by effecting the following arithmetic operation on the color data RD, GD and BD Wherein R₀, R₁ and R₂ are the first, second and third bits of the color data RD, respectively, and this is true with G₀ to G₂ and B₀ to B₂. Only the second to fourth bits Y₁ to Y₃ of the computation result are outputted as the luminance data YD. The aforesaid arithmetic operation bases on the following well known equation for converting analog RGB signals into a luminance signal The gray scale display circuit 54 is provided for implementing a gray scale display on the screen of the liquid crystal display device 11b in accordance with the luminance data YD. In contrast to the case of a CRT display screen being used, a gray scale display of a dot on the liquid crystal display screen must be performed such that the greater the luminance data is, the darker the display dot becomes, and that the smaller the luminance data, the brighter the display dot. Consequently, the luminance data YD of 0 represents black, and the luminance data YD of 7 represents white. The gray scale display effected in this embodiment will now be described. In this embodiment, display of dots on the liquid crystal display screen is effected at a speed of 70 frames per second, wherein eight frames constitutes one display period. And within each display period, each display dot on the liquid crystal display screen is activated in the frames determined in accordance with the luminance data YD, the number of frames corresponding to the luminance data YD. When the luminance data YD for a given dot is 7 , the dot is activated in each of eight frames within each display period, that is to say, eight times per display period. When the luminace data YD is 6 , the dot is activated in six frames within each display period. And when the luminance data YD is 0 white , the dot is not activated in any one of the eight frames within each display period. The gray scale display circuit 54 generates serial display data LD which is rendered 1 when the corresponding dot is to be activated in the frame and is rendered 0 when the dot should not be activated in the frame. The serial display data LD is supplied to a distribution circuit 55. In this case, the display data LD is supplied on a sixteen bit unit basis, wherein each unit is composed of eight bit serial data LDa for eight display dots in the display block A followed by eight bit serial data LDb for eight display dots in the display block B, as will be seen from Fig. 8 b . Thus, during each frame, each unit of the display data LD causes eight dots in each of the display blocks A and B to be displayed. The distribution circuit 55 is adapted to separate the eight bit data LDa for the display block A and the eight bit data LDb for the display block B from the display data LD and supplies the data LDa and LDb in parallel to the liquid crystal display device 11b. As stated before, the data LD from the gray scale display circuit 54 contains the eight bit data LDa and eight bit data LDb, and the data LDa and LDb are outputted alternately. The distribution circuit 55 latches the data LD on a sixteen bit unit basis and divides the latched data into the data LDa and LDb. The distribution circuit 55 then delivers both the data LDa and LDb bit by bit but in parallel to the liquid crystal display device 11b at a speed corresponding to the dot clock Ø. As described above, the display control circuit 18 outputs the color codes at a speed which is twice as high as that of the clock pulse Ø, so that the speed of transfer of the data LD from the gray scale display circuit 54 is also twice as high as that of the dot clock pulse Ø. The distribution circuit 55 latches the data LD on a sixteen bit unit basis, divides the same into the two data LDa and LDb each composed of eight bits, and outputs the data LDa and LDb in parallel at a speed which is half of that of the input data LD, that is, at the speed corresponding to the dot clock pulse Ø. Thus, the input and output data of the distribution circuit 55 are synchronized with each other, so that the amount of data inputted to the distribution circuit 55 and the amount of data outputted therefrom coincide to each other see Figs. 8 b and 8 c . The operation of this embodiment will now be described. There are two kinds of operation, namely, the operation for the CRT display device 11a and that for the liquid crystal display device 11b. And description is first given as to the operation for the CRT display device 11a. When the CRT display device 11a is used, the signal UD is not generated, so that the gate 22 in Fig. 1 is kept closed. Therefore, the output AV of the adder 26 always coincides with the count output V. The operation of the adder 26 in this case is as follows The operation of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 and the shift register 30 will now be described. When the scanning of the screen reaches the point P₂₀ in Fig. 7, the output of the AND gate AN₁ outputs a 1 signal. This 1 signal is fed to the load terminals L of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 through the OR gate OR₅. In consequence, the parallel to serial converter 16 and 17 load eight bit data outputted from the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 thereon, respectively. The data loaded onto the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 will now be described. When the 20th scanning line reaches the point P₂₀ in Fig. 7, the output signal of the AND gate AN₁ is rendered 1 , so that the flip flop 27 is reset and the lower order four bits of the output of the adder 26 become 0000 . And therefore, the address input terminals AD₄ to AD₀ are supplied with data of 00000 at this time, so that the addresses 0 of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 are accessed. More specifically, when the scanning of the screen has reached the point P₂₀, eight bit data in the addresses 0 of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 see Fig. 5 are read and supplied to the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17, respectively. When the scanning goes beyond the point P₂₀, the output signal of the AND gate AN₁ is rendered 0 , so that the signal applied to the load terminals L of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are also rendered 0 . As a result, the data loaded on the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 begin to be shifted out. Since the signal EN is maintained in the 1 state during the time when the scanning proceeds from the 20th scanning line to the 35th scanning line, the data shifted out of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are supplied through the AND gates AN₄ and AN₆ to the NAND gate NAN₁ and the AND gate AN₂, respectively. On the other hand, when the scanning has reached the point P₂₀, the 1 signal outputted from the AND gate AN₁ is loaded on the shift register 30 through the OR gate OR₆. This 1 signal is outputted from the shift register 30 when each of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 has shifted the loaded data by eight bits. The 1 signal outputted from the shift register 30 is supplied through the AND gate AN₇ to the set terminal S of the flip flop 27 and to the load terminals L of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17. Consequently, the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are again loaded with the eight bit data read from the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29, respectively. In this case, the flip flop 27 has been set, while the output of the adder 26 has been kept unchanged, so that the address terminals AD₄ to AD₀ are supplied with binary data 00001 . As a result, the addresses 1 of the both cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 are accessed. When the data from the addresses 1 are loaded onto the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17, the signal applied to the load terminals L thereof falls to 0 , so that the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 again begin to shift out the loaded data. Thus, the data representative of the left hand eight dots of the uppermost rows of dots of the cursor patterns PT1 and PT2 Fig. 5 are first read from the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 and are converted into serial data. And immediately after the parallel to serial conversions are completed, the data representative of the right hand eight dots of the uppermost rows of dots of the cursor patterns PT1 and PT2 are read and begin to be converted into serial data. When the shifts out of the data representative of the right hand eight dots are completed, the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 output 0 signals and continue to output the 0 signals thereafter until the loadings of data are effected again. When the scanning of the 20th horizontal line is completed, scanning of 21st horizontal line is commenced. And, when the scanning of the 21st horizontal line reaches the point P₂₁ shown in Fig. 7, the output signal of the AND gate AN₁ is again rendered 1 , so that the loading of data onto the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 is effected. At this time, the flip flop 27 is reset, and the lower order four bits of the output of the adder 26 are 0001 , and therefore, the address input terminals AD₄ to AD₀ are supplied with binary data of 00010 . Consequently, the data in the addresses 2 are read out. Upon completion of the parallel to serial conversion of these data by the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17, the 1 signal stored into the shift register 30 at the time of display of the dot P₂₁ is delayed by eight bit times and outputted therefrom, so that the flip flop 27 is brought into a set state. As a result, address data of 00011 is fed to the address input terminals AD₄ to AD₀, whereupon the data in the addresses 3 are read out. At this time, the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 effect loading operations, so that the data read from the addresses 3 are loaded onto the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17. Thus, the data read from the addresses 3 begin to be converted into serial forms immediately after the conversions of the data read from the addresses 2 are completed. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 successively output the serial pattern data cursor pattern signals CPS₁ and CPS₂ of the cursor patterns PT1 and PT2 shown in Figs. 5 a and 5 b in synchronization with the display timing of the cursor 24. The operations of the registers 46, 47 and 48 will now be described. The serial pattern data thus outputted from the parallel to serial converter 16 is supplied to the one input terminal of the NAND gate NAN₁. When the bit D₀ in the register 46 is 0 , the signal outputted from the NAND gate NAN₁ is 1 regardless of the state of the signal outputted from the parallel to serial converter 16. In consequence, the output signals from the OR gates OR₀ to OR₃ are all 1 , and all the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ are enabled to open, so that a four bit color code outputted from the display control cicuit 18 is allowed to pass through the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃. Thus, the cursor pattern PT1 is neglected. On the other hand, when the bit D₀ in the register 46 is 1 , the NAND gate NAN₁ functions as an inverter with respect to the output signal from the parallel to serial converter 16. Therefore, when the output signal CPS₁ from the parallel to serial converter 16 is 0 , the output signal from the NAND gate NAN₁ is 1 , and the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ are consequently enabled to open. When the output signal CPS₁ from the parallel to serial converter 16 is 1 , the output signal from the NAND gate NAN₁ is 0 . In this case, the respective output signals from the OR gates OR₀ to OR₃ coincide with the color code held in the register 47. In other words, the color code held in register 47 is outputted from the OR gates OR₀ to OR₃ In consequence, the data outputted from the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ is a logical product of the color code outputted from the display control circuit 18 and the color code which has been written into,the register 47. Since the color code outputted from the display control circuit 18 at this time designates the color of the background of the cursor 24, the color code outputted from the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ is a logical product of the color code in the register 47 and the color code of the background color. As will be clearly understood from the above description, when the bit D₀ in the register 46 is 0 , the cursor pattern PT1 stored in the cursor pattern memory 28 is not displayed, while when the bit D₀ in the register 46 is 1 , the cursor pattern PT1 is displayed in a color determined by a logical product of the color code in the register 47 and the color code of the background color. The signal CPS₂ outputted from the parallel to serial converter 17 is supplied to the one input terminal of the AND gate AN₂. When the bit D₁ in the register 46 is 0 , the signal outputted from the AND gate AN₂ is 0 regardless of the state of the signal CPS₂ outputted from the parallel to serial converter 17, and consequently, all the signals outputted from the AND gates AN₂₀ to AN₂₃ are rendered 0 . Thus, the exclusive OR gates EXOR₁₀ to EXOR₁₃ function simply as buffers for the output signals from the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃. As a result, the color code outputted from the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ is allowed to pass through the exclusive OR gates EXOR₁₀ to EXOR₁₃ and is supplied to the input terminals of the color palette 41. Thus, the cursor pattern PT2 is neglected. On the other hand, when the bit D₁ in the register 46 is 1 , the AND gate AN₂ is enabled to open, so that the output signal CPS₂ from the parallel to serial converter 17 is allowed to pass through the AND gate AN₂ and is supplied to the one input terminals of the AND gates AN₂₀ to AN₂₃. In consequence, when the output signal CPS₂ from the parallel to serial converter 17 is 1 , the color code held in the register 48 is supplied to the exclusive OR gates EXOR₁₀ to EXOR₁₃. Thus, the color code supplied to the color palette 41 is an exclusive OR sum of the color code outputted from the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ and the color code in the register 48. When the output signal CPS₂ from the parallel to serial converter 17 is 0 , all the signals outputted from the AND gates AN₂₀ to AN₂₃ are 0 . Therefore, the color code outputted from the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ is supplied through the exclusive OR gates EXOR₁₀ to EXOR₁₃ to the color palette 41. As will be understood from the above description, when the bit D₁ in the register 46 is 0 , the cursor pattern PT2 stored in the cursor pattern memory 29 is not displayed, while when the bit D₁ of the register 46 is 1 , the cursor pattern PT2 is displayed in a color determined by the exclusive OR sum of the color code outputted from the AND gates AN₁₀ to AN₁₃ and the color code held in the register 48. The foregoing is the operation of the display controller 10 carried out when the CRT display device 11a is used. The operation of the display controller 10 effected when the liquid crystal display device 11b is used will now be described. As mentioned before, in the case where the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, the display is performed in the form of gray scale display instead of the color display. To this end, the luminance computing circuit 53, gray scale display circuit 54 and distribution circuit 55 are used in place of the digital to analog converters DAC₅₀ to DAC₅₂. On the other hand, when the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, the vertical counter 20 repeats the counting operation within the range of between 0 and 99 in decimal, because each of the display blocks A and B comprises a hundred horizontal lines. Description will be first given as to the display operation of the background of the image on the screen. When the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, the display control circuit 18 produces the signal UD. As mentioned before, the signal UD is in a 0 state when the display control circuit 18 reads data concerning the display block A, and is in a 1 state when it reads data concerning the display block B. Therefore, the gate 22 outputs the data of 0 when the data concerning the display block A are read from the video memory 40 and outputs the data of 100 in decimal when the data concerning the display block B are read from the video memory 40. Consequently, when the data concerning the display block A are read, the output data AV of the adder 21 coincides with the count output V of the vertical counter 20, while when the data concerning the display block B are read, the output data AV of the adder 21 becomes equal to the sum of the count output V and the data representative of 100 . The signal level of the signal UD is changed each time a time period corresponding to eight display dots lapses. The display control circuit 18 reads the color codes from the video memory 40 in accordance with the data AV in the following manner. When the scanning of the screen is commenced, the count output V of the vertical counter 20 is 0 . The signal UD is also 0 because the color codes for the display block A are read first. And therefore, the data AV is also 0 , so that the display control circuit 18 reads the color codes corresponding to the 0th to 7th dots of the display block A from the video memory 40. When the reading of the color codes for the display block A is completed, the state of the signal UD is changed from 0 to 1 , so that the value of the data AV becomes equal to 100 in decimal. Consequently, the display control circuit 18 reads the color codes corresponding to the 0th to 7th dots of the display block B. Thereafter, the display control circuit 18 automatically increments the addresses, without references to the data AV, to thereby successively and alternately read the color codes for the display blocks A and B on an eight bit unit basis. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 8 a , the color codes corresponding to the 8th to 15th dots of the display block A are read and then the color codes corresponding to the 8th to 15th dots of the display block B are read. And thereafter, reading operation similar to the above is repeatedly carried out. When the scanning of the first horizontal lines of the display blocks A and B is commenced in response to the increment of the vertical counter 20, the data AV alternately takes values 1 and 101 . Therefore, the display controller 18 reads the color codes for the 640th to 647th dots of the display block A when the data AV first becomes 1 , and reads the color codes for the 640th to 647th dots of the display block B when the data AV first becomes 101 . Thereafter, the display control circuit 18 automatically increments the addresses, without references to the data AV, to thereby successively and alternately read the color codes for the display blocks A and B on an eight bit unit basis. The foregoing is the operation of the display control circuit 18 for reading the color codes. The thus read color codes are converted into the aforesaid display data LDa and LDb through the color palette 41, luminance computing circuit 53, gray scale display circuit 54 and distribution circuit 55. The display data LDa and LDb are then fed to the liquid crystal display device 11b, thereby the background is displayed on the display blocks A and B. Description will now be given as to the display of the cursor 24. The function of the registers 46, 47 and 48 in this case is the same as that in the operation for the display of the cursor on the CRT display screen, and the description thereof will be omitted. In this embodiment, as mentioned before, the display data for eight dots of the display blocks A and B are formed alternately. Therefore, the area of the display screen of the liquid crystal display device 11b is divided, in accordance with the forming of the display data, into sections separated by imaginary vertical lines spaced from each other by eight dots, as shown in Fig. 9. Since the cursor 24 is composed of a 16 X 16 dot matrix, the left hand edge of the cursor 24 may or may not align with the imaginary vertical lines separating the aforesaid sections, depending upon the display position of the cursor 24. For example, the left hand edge of the cursor 24 displayed at a position P₀₁ in Fig. 9 aligns with one of the imaginary vertical lines, while that of the cursor 24 displayed at the position P₀₂ does not align with any one of the imaginary vertical lines. The processing for reading the cursor pattern whose left hand edge coincides with one of the imaginary vertical lines differs from that for reading the cursor pattern whose left hand edge does not coincide with any one of the imaginary vertical lines. The processing for reading the cursor pattern whose left hand edge coincides with one of the imaginary vertical lines will first be described. When the cursor 24 is displayed at the position P₀₁ shown in Fig. 9, the reading of the cursor patterns is commenced at time t₁ when the count outputs H and V coincide respectively to the contents of the registers 23 and 25, and data corresponding to eight dots is read from the address 0 of each of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29. After the reading and shifting of the data corresponding to the eight dots from each of the memories 28 and 29, the signal UD is rendered 1 at time t₂ whereupon the data AV is increased by 100 in decimal. This causes the result of the calculation effected by the adder 26 to exceed 16 , so that the signal EN outputted from the NOR gate NOR₁ is rendered 0 . As a result, the AND gates AN₇ closes and the AND gate AN₈ opens, so that the 1 signal inputted to the shift register 30 eight bit times before, that is, at the time t₁, is fed through the AND gate AN₈ and the OR gate OR₆ back to the input terminal thereof. At this time, the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are not supplied with the loading signals. On the other hand, when the signal UD is rendered 1 , the display control circuit 18 reads eight color codes for the display block B. More specifically, the display control circuit 18 reads the color codes for the portion of the background to be displayed on the display block B, which portion is 100 horizontal lines below the portion displayed on the display block A, as shown in Fig. 9. When the processing of the data corresponding to the eight dots on the display block B is completed at time t₃, the signal UD is again rendered 0 , so that the result of the calculation effected by the adder 26 again becomes equal to 0 . In consequence, the signal EN is rendered 1 , so that the AND gate AN₇ opens while the AND gate AN₈ closes. The 1 signal inputted to the shift register 30 at the time t₁ is outputted therefrom through the AND gate AN₇ after a lapse of a period corresponding to eight cycles of the dot clock pulses Ø, that is, at the time t₃. Consequently, the loading signal is supplied to the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 and the flip flop 27 is brought into a set state, so that the eight bit data in the addresses 1 of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 are read and loaded onto the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17. As will be readily understood from the foregoing, the reading of the eight bit data from the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 and the reading of the color codes for the dots on the display block B are effected alternately in this case. And the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 serially output the loaded cursor pattern data on an eight bit unit basis. In the above described operation, the data loaded on the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are outputted at a speed which is twice as high as that of the dot clock pulse Ø. The reason for this is that when the liquid crystal display device 11b is used, the display control circuit 18 delivers the color codes at a speed which is twice as high as that of the dot clock pulse Ø. When the Y coordinate written in the register 25 exceeds 100 in decimal, the result of the calculation effected by the adder 26 is within the range of between 0 and 15 only when the data AV exceeds 100 and when the signal UD is in the state of 1 , so that the cursor 24 is displayed in the designated position on the display block B. Thus, the designation of the Y coordinate of the cursor 24 can be made in the same manner as that for the CRT display device 11a, wherein the display screen is constituted by the upper display block A and the lower display block B, and the uppermost and lowermost horizontal lines of the display screen are 0th and 199th horizontal scanning lines, respectively. The above operation can also be applied to the case where a part of the cursor 24 is disposed in the display block A and the remaining part thereof is disposed in the display block B, that is, when the cursor 24 is displayed, for example, at a position P₀₃ shown in Fig. 9. The process for reading the cursor pattern 24 whose left hand edge does not coincide with any one of the imaginary vertical lines will now be described. It is assumed that the cursor 24 should now be displayed at the position P₀₂ shown in Fig. 9. In this case, when the count outputs H and V coincide with the contents of the registers 23 and 25 at time t₅, the eight bit data in the addresses 0 of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 are read and loaded onto the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 in a manner described for the above case. The data thus loaded on the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are serially outputted therefrom at a speed twice as high as the speed of the clock pulse Ø. At time t₆ when the serial output of the three higher order bits of each of the data loaded on the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 is completed, the signal UD is rendered 1 , so that the data AV is increased by 100 . And therefore, the result of the calcula ion effected by the adder 26 exceeds 16 . In consequence, the signal EN is rendered 0 , so that both of the AND gates AN₄₆ are closed, whereas both of the AND gate AN₃ and AN₅ are opened. As a result, the remaining five bits of the data loaded on the parallel to serial converter 16 and the remaining five bits of the data loaded on the parallel to serial conver er 17 are fed back to the input terminals Si thereof through the AND gates AN₃ and AN₅, respectively. On the other hand, the display control circuit 18 starts to read the color codes for the display block B at the time t₆ when the signal UD rises to 1 . Thus, the display control circuit 18 reads the color codes corresponding to eight dots on the display block B from the video memory 40. At time t₇ when the reading of the eight color codes is completed, the signal UD is again rendered 0 , so that the result of the calculation effected by the adder 26 is again rendered 0 , whereby the signal EN is rendered 1 . Consequently, the AND gates AN₄ and AN₆ open and the AND gates AN₃ and AN₅ close. Since the contents of the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 are shifted at a speed twice as high as the dot clock pulse Ø, the remaining five bits of each of the data loaded on the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 begins to be shifted out from the output terminal So thereof at this time. As a result, from the time t₇, the remaining five bits of the data loaded on the parallel to serial converter 16 and the remaining five bits of the data loaded on the parallel to serial converter 17 are serially outputted through the AND gates AN₄ and AN₆, respectively. The state of the signal EN and the data contained in the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 during the period from the time t₅ to the time t₇ are shown in Fig. 10. At time t₈ when the serial output of the remaining five bits of each of the data loaded on the parallel to serial conver ers 16 and 17 is completed, the 1 signal, which was inputted to the shift register 30 a time interval corresponding to eight cycles of the dot clock pulse Ø before, i. e., at the time t₅, is outputted therefrom through the AND gate AN₇. As a result, the loading signal is supplied to the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17, and the flip flop 27 is brought into a set state. Therefore, the data in the addresses 1 of the cursor pattern memories 28 and 29 are read therefrom and loaded onto the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17, respectively. At time t₉ when the higher order three bits of each of the loaded eight bit data are outputted, the scanning point reaches the boundary of the sections on the display screen. At this time t₉, the same processing as that performed at the time t₆ is carried out. Thus, when the cursor 24 is displayed at such a position that the left hand edge thereof does not coincide with any one of the boundaries of the display sections, the data remaining in the parallel to serial converters 16 and 17 at the time when the scanning point reaches one of the boundaries are held therein until the time when the remaining data should begin to be outputted. Thus, designation of the coordinates of the cursor 24 can be made in the same manner as that for the CRT display device 11a, wherein the display blocks A and B are deemed as constituting one display screen. This is true with the case where the cursor 24 is displayed on the display block B and with the case where a part and the remaining part of the cursor 24 are displayed respectively on the display blocks A and B. Although in the above embodiment the display screen of the liquid crystal display device 11b is composed of two display blocks A and B, this is not exclusive and a liquid crystal display device can have three or more display blocks. In such a case, the number of bits of the signal UD is increased so that each of the display blocks for which display data must be formed can be designated. Also the display controller is modified so that a certain value determined in accordance with the display block currently used is added to the count output V. The present invention is advantageous in the following respects
