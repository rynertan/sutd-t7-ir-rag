# Electromagnetic transducer.

## Abstract
A variable reluctance transducer includes a C shaped assembly 10 defining a magnetic circuit, one limb of the C being longer than the other. The assembly 10 is arranged with its limbs on opposite of a movable member 16 . A winding 14 linked to the magnetic circuit is connected to a discriminating circuit including an integrator A, R, C having a variable bias circuit D1, D2, R3, R2, C2, C2, A2, R4 which ensures that the peaks of the integrator output are in a predetermined relationship to a reference voltage. A compa rator A3 compares the integrator output with the reference voltage.
