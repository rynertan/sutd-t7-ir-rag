When row address strobe signal RAS Fig. 2A is at a high level precharge period , one of bit lines BL andBL, for example, line BL is at Vcc potential and the other bit line BL is at Vss potential. Assume now that row address strobe signal RAS is changed to L or low level. Then, precharge signal fpc is changed to H or high level, thus turning transistor N3 on. Therefore, bit lines BL and BL are short circuited and precharged to 1 2 Vcc potential. After precharge signal fpc Fig. 2B has been changed to L or a low level, a word line Wi i l, 2, 3, ... Fig. 2C , for example, W1, is selected by input address signal and rendered high.The data stored in memory cell MCl connected to word line W1 is, therefore, read out on bit line BL.

With the conventional precharge circuit, however, a relatively long period elpases from the time precharge signal fpc becomes a high level to the time bit linesBL, BL becomes a 1 2 Vcc potential.

N channel MOS transistor N3 is connected between bit lines BL and BL. Transistor N3 is provided for precharging bit lines BL and BL to a potential intermediate between the reference potential Vss and a power source potential Vcc higher than Vss. The gate of transistor N3 is supplied with a precharge signal fpc Fig. 4B . Intermediate applying circuit 10 is provided between bit lines BL and BL. Applying circuit 10 comprisesN channel type MOS transistors N4 and N5 serially connected between bit lines BL and BL. The gate of transistors N4 and N5 are supplied with precharge signal fpc Fig. 4B . The node of transistors N4 and N5 is supplied with an intermediate potential of a power source potential Vcc, i.e., 1 2 Vcc potential, through line 11. 1 2 Vcc potential is supplied from a 1 2 Vcc potential generator not shown for generating 1 2 Vcc potential. Transistors N4 and N5 are rendered on when precharge pulse fpc is at high and rendered off when precharge pulse fpc is at low. When row address strobe signal RAS Fig. 4A is at a high level, one of bit lines BL and BL, for example, line BL is at Vcc potential and the other bit line BL is at Vss potential. When row address strobe signal RAS is at H or a high level, precharge signal fpc is also at a high level. Assume now that row address strobe signal RAS is changed to L or a low level. Then, precharge signal fpc is also changed to L or a low level, thus turning transistor N3 off. Thereafter, a word line Wi i l, 2, 3, ... Fig. 4C , for example,W1, is selected by input address signal and rendered high. The data stored in memory cell MC1 connected to word line W1 is, therefore, read out on bit line BL.At the same time, dummy word line not shown is selected and rendered high, and the data stored in memory dummy cell not shown connected to dummy word line not shown is read out on bit line BL. The potential on bit line BL is at this time 1 2 Vcc potential. While, the potential on bit line BL is at this time several tens mV higher or lower than reference potential according whether data read out of selected cell MC1 Vcc is 1 or 0. Therefore, a little difference of voltage appear between bit lines BL and BL. Thereafter, enable signal fsen is rendered low enable signal fsen is rendered high , amplifying the voltage difference between bit lines BL and BL. As a result, the potential on bit lineBL is Vcc potential, and the potential on bit line BL is Vss potential.Thereafter, RAS signal is changed to a high level. At the same time precharge signal fpc is also changed to a high level, thereby turning transistors N3, N4 and N5 on. Since transistor N3 is turned on so that bit lines BL and BL are short circuited. Also since transistors N4 and N5 are turned on so that bit lines BL and BL are connected to 1 2 Vcc potential through transistors N4 and NS, respectively, and precharged to 1 2 Vcc potential. As described above, with the precharge circuit of this embodiment, when RAS signal is changed to a high level, precharge signal fpc is also changed to a high level, thereby turning transistors N3, N4 and N5 on, so that bit lines BL and BL are short circuited and connected to 1 2 Vcc potential. Therefore, no leak current through a memory cell will occur and a potential on bit lines BL and BL is not lowered, even when the precharge period is long. This makes the sense operation stable. Furthermore, since bit lines BL and BL are precharged when an active period starts, the access time is shorted. This invention is not limited to the embodiment mentioned above. N channel MOS transistors Q1 to Q4 may be replaced by P channel MOS transistors. Precharging N channel MOS transistors N3 to N5 may also be replaced byP channel MOS transistors. As clearly understood from the above, with a precharge circuit of the invention, the access time can be shortened, and the sense operation can be stable even when a precharge period is long.
