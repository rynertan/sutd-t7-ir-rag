# Tunnel boring machine.

## Abstract
A tunnel boring machine for controlled boring of an elon gated curvilinear tunnel in earthen strata. The tunnel boring machine comprises cutting means for engaging the tunnel face and removing material therefrom to elongate the tunnel during a cutting strocke elongated body means for supporting various machine components elongate thrust arm means for urging the cutting means against the tunnel face during a cut ting stroke and for advancing the elongated body means along the tunnel between cutting strokes, the thrust arm means being extendable and retractable from the body means along a thrust arm axis coaxial a machine longitudinal axis forward lateral positioning means operably mounted on a forward por tion of the body means for selectively controlling the lateral po sitioning of a forward portion of the body means within the tun nel rear lateral positioning means operably mounted on a rear portion of the body means for selectively controlling the lateral positioning of the rear portion of the body means within the tunnel forward transverse positioning means operably mounted on a forward portion of the body means for selectively controlling the transverse positioning of a forward portion of the body means within the tunnel rear transverse positioning means operably mounted on a rear portion of the body means for selectively controlling the transverse positioning of the body means within the tunnel whereby the machine longitudi nal axis is selectively transversely and or laterally positionable relative the longitudinal axis of the tunnel through the use of the forward and rear lateral positioning means and the forward and rear transverse positioning means and tunnel gripping means operably mounted on the body means for selectively grippingly engaging the peripheral sidewall of the tunnel to pre vent rearward movement of the body means during a cutting stroke. Various methods of operation of the machine are de scribed.
