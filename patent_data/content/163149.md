# Membrane keyboard switch mounting.

## Abstract
A multilayer membrane switch keyboard structure is disclosed wherein the flexible membrane 8 is fixedly attached to a support frame member 40 by a pattern of adhesive regions 26 , the region positioned in locations corresponding to the switch locations 18 of the structure. The adhesive engagement of the bottom surface of the membrane structure 8 stabilizes the bottom electrical contact and, at the same time, leaves open regions between the adhesive regions which will accommodate air which is exhausted from the switch cavity through a hole 30 formed in the bottom layer 16 of the multilayered switch structure 8 into communication with the open regions between the adhesive regions. Thus, the open regions act to exhaust the air in a switch cavity, when the switch is activated.
