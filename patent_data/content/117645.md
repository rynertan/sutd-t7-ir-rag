## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device, more particularly to a semiconductor memory device provided with two separate circuits used during write and read operations, respectively, as a data transfer means between bit lines and data buses. In a semiconductor memory device, for example, a dynamic random access memory DRAM comprising matrix arranged memory cells, the memory cells are connected at the cross points of word lines and bit lines. Row selection of the memory cells is performed by selection of a word line. Column selection of the memory cells is performed by selection of a pair of bit lines in response to the output of a column decoder. Each bit line pair is connected to a sense amplifier. To each side of each sense amplifier to which the pairs of bit lines are connected, a dummy cell is connected. In reading the memorized data, when one of the right side memory cells is selected, the left side dumb cell is selected. When any one of the left side memory cells is selected, the right side dummy cell is selected. The dummy cell provides a reference potential during the read operation from the memory cell. Between each bit line and one of a pair of data buses, a transfer gate is connected as a data transfer means. The signal read out from the memory cell connected to the selected word line is transferred to the pair of bit lines, amplified by the sense amplifier, and supplied to the data buses through the transfer gates. In write operations, the writing data signals supplied from the data buses, which are usually in the form of complementary signals, are transferred to the bit lines through the transfer gates and one of the selected data signals is written into the selected memory cell. In the last part of the read operation period in most practical DRAM s, the bit lines are driven by a buffer circuit which is connected to the data buses to provide amplified output signals. That is, a rewrite operation is performed via the transfer gates to retrieve the necessary bit line potential which has been lost during the preceding part of the read operation period for driving the data buses. However, it is desirable to prevent the data memorized in the memory cells from destruction, even if the read operation is stopped halfway. Such an interruption of the read operation should be permitted, to facilitate the timing design of a system using the memory device. In the case where the semiconductor memory device enters a precharge mode before completing the rewrite operation, the potential on the bit line, which has been changed due to redistribution of electric charges via the transfer gate between the bit lines and the data buses, is memorized in the selected memory cell. This results in possible destruction of the memorized data in the memory cell. A static semiconductor memory employing separate transfer means between bit lines and data lines for reading and writing, respectively, is disclosed in THE SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY BOOK , published by Intel Marketing communications in 1978, on pages 22 to 25. In this memory, the transfer means for reading has a high input impedance and a low output impedance. According to the present invention, there is provided a dynamic semiconductor memory device comprising a word line, a pair of bit lines, a memory cell connected to said word line and one of said bit lines, a pair of data buses, a sense amplifier connected to said pair of bit lines, a first transfer means connected between said pair of bit lines and said pair of data buses for transferring data from the data buses to the bit lines in a write operation, and a second transfer means having a high impedance input and a low impedance output connected between said pair of bit lines and said pair of data buses for transferring data from the bit lines to the data buses in a read operation whilst minimising a change in the potential of the bit lines. An embodiment of the present invention can provide a semiconductor memory device, wherein data memorized in a memory cell is not destroyed even if the data read operation stops midway due to a system reset or the like. Use of the device prevents redistribution of electric charges from causing fluctuation of the potential of the bit line to a middle level during a read operation. Therefore, even if a system reset occurs at any time in the read operation, the data in the memory cell is not destroyed. As a result, the semiconductor memory device facilitates the timing design of the system because it does not impose any restriction upon the system as to the timing of the termination of the read access. Reference is made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Prior to describing an embodiment of the present invention, an explanation of a conventional DRAM will be given with reference to Fig. 1 for comparative purposes. The DRAM of Fig. 1 comprises a sense amplifier SA, a pair of bit lines BL and The operation of the DRAM in Fig. 1 will now be explained with reference to Fig. 2. The reset clock ø Next, the row address strobe signal Concurrently, a dummy cell not shown connected to the other bit line BL is selected to provide a potential change on the bit line BL which forms a reference level with respect to the potential of the opposite bit line Then, when a sense amplifier enable clock ø Then, a clock ø Now, when writing data into a memory cell MC, write signals are supplied to the data buses DB and In the conventional DRAM of Fig. 1, if, during a data read operation, the DRAM enters a precharge mode in which the In the last part of the normal read cycle, the potential difference is enlarged again by the data buffer BUF, which is basically comprised of a cross coupled transistor pair for forming a latch circuit. If, however, a processor or the like connected to the DRAM of Fig. 1 commands the DRAM to enter the precharge mode prior to the activation of the data buffer BUF by resetting the row address strobe signal Namely, in the conventional DRAM of Fig. 1, there is a disadvantage that resetting of the processor or the like connected to the DRAM may destroy the memorized data in the case where the period of the read cycle defined by the row address strobe signal Hereinafter, a semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be explained. Figure 3 shows a partial constitution of a DRAM of the semiconductor memory device. In Fig. 3, elements identical with the elements of Fig. 1 bear identical reference marks. One of the important differences between the DRAM of Fig. 3 and that of Fig. 1 is that the former transfers data between the bit lines BL and The transistors Q6 and Q8 are series connected between the data bus DB and a power source Vss, for example, the ground, and the transistors Q7 and Q9 are series connected between the data bus The signal CL The operation of the DRAM of Fig. 3 is explained with reference to Fig. 4. In reading data from a selected memory cell MC, during the preceding reset or precharge period in which the row address strobe signal As a result, the potential difference between the bit lines BL and As a result, the transistors Q6 and Q7 are turned on, and, since the bit line BL is a high level and the bit line In performing such a read operation, in the DRAM of Fig. 3, the potentials of the data buses DB and Namely, as shown in Fig. 4, for example, the potential on the bit lines BL remains at a high level, and the potential on the bit line When writing data into the memory cell MC using the DRAM of Fig. 3, write data supplied to the data buses DB and In the above embodiment each column comprising a pair of bit lines is provided with a set of a column decoder DEC and gate circuits GW and GR. However, it is possible to modify this constitution so that only one set of circuits DEC, GW and GR is provided for a plurality of columns by adding a column selection means. For example, if two data bus pairs are provided along the sense amplifiers which are alternately connected thereto, only one set of the column control circuits DEC, GW and GR need be provided for two columns to control the two columns in common. The number of necessary column decoders can be further decreased by using different column selection means, for example, column selection lines and selection gates, so that plural pairs of gate circuits GW and GR are driven by a common decoder output through the selection gates. In these modifications, however, still one set of write transfer gates Q1 and Q2 and read transfer gate circuits Q6 to Q9 should be provided per each bit line pair.
