## Description
This invention relates to pyridine derivatives which are useful as anti ulcer agents, their production and use. As pyridine derivatives having anti ulcer action, those described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Laid open No. 141783 1979, and those described in Japanese Unexamined Laid open No. 135881 1983 are known. However, the known compounds described above are not necessarily considered desirable anti ulcer agents because of their poor gastric mucosa protecting action though they inhibit secretion of gastric juice. Moreover they have a physical defect in that they are unstable and easily decomposed. Thus those agents that not only inhibit secretion of gastric juice but also protect the gastric mucosa more effectively have been desired. As prior art, reference is also made to EP A 0 074 341 and WO 86 02646. As the result of the inventors research to obtain anti ulcer agents which are able to inhibit effectively secretion of gastric juice, to protect the gastric mucosa, to exert excellent anti ulcer action, etc., the inventors found that some pyridine derivatives are suitable for the purpose and completed this invention after their research.

Pharmacological actions of the compounds of the present invention are described as follows. While the role of acid in causing gastric and duodenal ulcerations has been well known, importance of the protecting ability of gastric mucosa has been attracting the attention in recent years. Miller T. A., Am. J. Physiol., Male Sprague Dawley rats 7 weeks old were fasted for 24 hours. These animals were administered test compounds into the stomach by using a gastric tube. After 30 minutes, 1 ml of 100 ethanol was administered orally. The animals were killed by carbon dioxide gas 60 minutes after ethanol administration. The stomach was removed together with the lower part of esophagus and the duodenum. The esophagus was clipped, 10 ml of 1 formalin solution was instilled into the stomach from the duodenum, and then the duodenum was clipped. The whole stomach was immersed in 1 formalin solution. About 15 minutes later, the stomachs were opened along the greater curvature. Length of the lesions which occurred in the gastric corpus mucosa was measured under a dissecting microscope with a square grid eye piece x10 . The sum total length of the individual lesions in each animal was measured, and the average value per group was calculated. Based on the difference between the average value of each group and that of the control group, the inhibition rate was determined. The test compound was suspended in a 5 gum arabic solution, and administered in a volume of 2 ml kg. As shown by the above data, the compounds of this invention have an evidently superior action in protecting the gastric mucosa as compared with known compounds. Besides, the compound I of this invention shows excellent actions of inhibiting gastric juice secretion, protecting gastric mucosa and preventing ulceration. Regarding the toxicity of the compound I of this invention, oral administration of the compound employed for the experiment of an action protecting gastic mucosa the compounds of R¹ H, R² CH₃, R³ CH₃, and of R¹ H, R² CH₃, R³ CH₂CF₃ to mice even in a dose of 500 mg kg caused no fatal effect, thus the compound I generally is low in toxicity. As described in the foregoing, the compounds I of this invention have excellent gastric juice secretion inhibiting activity, gastric mucosa protecting activity, and anti ulcer activity, and can be used for the prevention and treatment of digestive ulcers e.g. gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer and gastritis in mammals e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat, man because of the low toxicity. For the treatment of digestive ulcer in mammals, the compounds I of this invention can be orally given in the dosage form such as capsules, tablets and granules obtained by mixing with pharmacologically acceptable carriers, such as excipients e.g. lactose, starch, sucrose, etc. , disintegrators e.g. starch, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, etc. , lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, etc. , binders e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, macrogol, etc. , and so on. The dose ranges from about 0.01 to 30 mg kg day, more preferably from about 0.1 to 3 mg kg day. The compounds with n 0 among the compounds I of this invention are useful starting compounds for the production of the compounds with n 1. The compounds I of this invention have not only gastric juice secretion inhibiting activity but also gastric mucosa protecting activity, and therefore they exert remarkable anti ulcer action. Thus the compounds I of this invention are useful for prevention and treatment of gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, etc. The production of the starting compounds used for this invention and the compounds I of this invention are illustrated in detail in the following Reference Examples and Examples. 3 Methoxy 2 methyl 4 1H pyridone 1.39 g and propyl iodide 2.0 ml were dissolved in dimethylformamide 20 ml , to which silver oxide 2.31 g was added in small portions and stirred vigorously at room temperature for 5 hours.
