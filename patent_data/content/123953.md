# Flat laminate part consisting of a substrate layer, a cover layer and an auxiliary pull off means for the cover layer.

## Abstract
The present invention is related to a flat laminate part con sisting of a substrate layer and a cover layer the adhesive com pounding between said substrate layer and said cover layer be ing such that both layers are securely held together, but a pull off of said cover layer from said substrate layer is readily possi ble by hand or mechanically, said flat laminate part having addi tionally an auxiliary pull off means to so pull off said cover layer or parts of said cover layer by hand or mechanically along pre set cuts or, respectively, preset breaking lines 4 in said cover layer, wherein said preset cuts or preset breaking lines in said cover layer are positioned and formed such that there is at least one part 6, 7 of the cover layer which can be grasped per each part of said cover layer to be pulled off, said grasp part is, getting exposed by bending the flat laminate part get ting exposed by bending the flat laminate part to form a con cave curvature of the surface of said cover layer opposite to the surface of said cover layer adhearing to said substrate lay er and that the two points of attack 5 of the force producing such bending of the flat laminate part are distributed over the surface of the flat laminate part such that the hand produced or mechanical pull off forces acting substantially vertically to the laminate result in a peeling off of said grasp part of said cover layer.
