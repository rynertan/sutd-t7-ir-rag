# Numerical control screw tightening machine.

## Abstract
By utilizing a movable table 19 , an electrical driver 21 attached to the table 19 , a hole position detecting means 26 for detecting a hole position of the work roughly disposed beforehand, with using an ultra sonic element 53 , the hole position can be detected precisely and a screw tightening can be executed exactly and automatically even when the hole position is so discrepant within predetermined area.
