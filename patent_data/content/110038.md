## Description
POLYMER INTERDISPERSIONS, RELATED COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF IAKING SkdE The present invention relates to polymer inter aispersions, related compositions, and to the methods of making same. CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application relates to application SerialNo. 427,386 of Edward Wilkus and Alexander Wu, entitled Cables Formed With Interdispersed Polymer Insulation Compositions and Method of Making Docket 4lWC 2175 to application Serial No. 427,213 of Edward Wilkus andAlexander Wu, entitled Crosslinked Polymer Interdispersions Containing Polyolefin amd Method of Making Docket 41WC 2176 and to application Serial No. 426,395 of Edward Wilkus andAlexander Wu, entitled Cables Formed With Crosslinked Interdispersed Polymer Insulation Compositions Containing Polyethylene and Method of Making Docket 41WC 2177 , all assigned to the same assignee as this application and filed concurrently herewith. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Homopolymers have properties which are characteristic for each type of polymer. Low density polyethylene generally has good film forming properties and is generally competitive with other polymeric materials in this application, but it does not have high transparency or clarity in molded applications. By contrast, polystyrene does nothave good film forming properties, but it does have good transparency and clarify in molded applications. There are numerous other illustrations of distinct tive sets of physical, electrical, chemical and mechanical properties which are manifested by types of polymers including polyvinyl chloride, polyacetal, polyamides, polyethers, polyolefins, etc., and which are manifested by different species of a polymer type as, for example, nylon 6, nylon 11, nylon 66, etc. It is sometimes possible to combine properties of different types of polymers or species members by forming blends. Blends may be formed where it is found that the polymers are naturally compatible, i.e., where it is found that one polymer can be mixed with or dissolved in another polymer without the involvement of permanent chemical reaction, but with a resultant intimate uniform intermixing of the two polymers to give an apparent homogeneous composition which does not separate into its ingredient components or segregate during ordinary processing such as heating and conventional forming as by extrusion, molding, etc., and which does not segregate after processing with ordinary use or aging.Naturally occurring blends may exhibit combinations of properties which are greater than the average of the blend ingredients for the proportions of the ingredients in the blends. As used herein, the term alloy blends or solution blends is meant to indicate the types of blends which exhibit the unique set of apparent thermodynamic behaviors. By contrast, the term polymer blends or blends is meant to refer to compositions which, even when in very intimate state of intermixing at or near a molecular level, are not known to exhibit such distinct and unique apparent thermo dynamic behavior as that exhibited by alloy blends or true blends such as NORYL polymer available from General ElectricCompany. However, the term blends as used for combined or mixed polymers is not intended to mean that a molecular level of intermixing is achieved or even achievable for a combination of polymers which are mixed. The degree of mixing which is achieved for a given level of mixing effort or energy expended is largely dependent on the affinity of one polymer of a mixture for the other polymer or polymers of the mixture.For most polymer combinations, the affinity or compatibility factor prevents a very intimate or molecular level of mixing to be achieved with the level of mixing attainable by conventional industrial polymer processing and mixing equipment. As used herein, the term polymer or resin is intended to include both naturally occurring and synthetic polymers and, accordingly, to include natural and synthetic rubbers, and polymers such as polyolefins, polyamides and other synthetic resins. Polymer affinity factcrs may be classified according to a number of different groupings. For example, some polymers such as polyethylenes are more highly crystalline and are in a class of more highly crystalline polymers generally having a sharper softening or melting point. Low density polyethyleene is about 55 to 60 crystalline and high density polyethylene is over 90 crystalline. Others are classified as glassy polymers and these soften over a wider temperature range. There are essentially no naturally compatible or easily formed binary blends of highly crystalline polymers such as polyethylene with the more glassy polymers such as polyvinyl chloride. By naturally occurring blends as used herein is meant blends which are formed readily with ordinary and conventional heating and mixing and which persist due to the inherent compatibilities of the components of the blend. Such compatibility may be due to similar molecular and chemical structure. For example, chlorinated polyethylene blends to a degree with natural rubber or with styrene butadiene rubber as pointed out in U.S. Patent 4,262,098. As a general rule, a polymer material has a useful life expectancy which is related to the thermal and other energy history which it has experienced in the processing and fabrication stage. Accordingly, it is desirable generally to process a polymer and fabricate an article from a polymer at a lower set of energy input conditions and particularly at lower temperatures and lower time at temperature in order to preserve as much as possible of the inherent useful life expectancy of the polymer. Generally, a different set of polymer properties are obtained in the copolymers formed by copolymerization of the distinct monomers in combination than are obtained by separately polymerizing the individual monomers to their respective homopolymers. For example, while neither polyethylene nor higher molecular weight polypropylene has distinctly rubbery properties some ethylene propylene copolymers have distinctly rubbery properties. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is accordingly one object of the present invention to provide broad spectrun interdispersing agents for dispersing normally incompatible and poorly compatible polymer materials, including organic and inorganic polymers. BRIEF SUEEARY OF THE INVENTION In one of its broader aspects, objects of the invention may be achieved by dispersing polytetrafluoroethylene, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene or high molecular weight polyethylene in fine filamentary form into a multinarv set of poorly compatible and or incompatible polymers to form an interdispersion of the polymers to a desired degree of intimacy of contact of the interdispersed set of polymers. DETAILED DESCRIPTION It has been discovered that normally incompatible and, accordingly, normally unblendable polymers may be interdispersed with the aid of conventional polymer processing apparatus and methods which generate internal shearing action in the polymers where a relatively small concentration of polytetrafluoroethylene is incorporated in fibrous form in the polymer materials being processed. It has now been discovered that two polymers which are not normally blended when heated and mixed in conventional equipment used for this purpose at a given set of conditions can be made to interdisperse to a desired degree of intimacy of contact by the addition of a small amount of polytetrafluoroethylene to the material and by the same conventional heating and mixing equipment under the same set of conditions. The powdered polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE material used in connection with this invention is a fine powdered polytetrafluoroethylene which is currently commercially available from the E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company of Wilmington, Delaware, hereafter referred to as Du PontCompany, under the trade designation Teflon 6, also sometimes abbreviated as T 6. It has further been observed that the fibrous nature of the polytetrafluoroethylene interdispersing agent causes a binding together of the interdispersed polymers when they are in the early stages of interdispersion. For example, it has been observed that when two incompatible polymers are interdispersed with the aid of the polytetrafluoroethylene and the material is stretched into a sheet or film when the degree of dispersion is of a lower order, there is a tendency of the material to display a network of fibers and quasi particles. The particles are not clearly identifiable as such, but appear to be closely linked and somewhat conforming to adjacent particles.However, at an early stage of the interdispersing, the polymers being interdispersed may display a much lower resiseance to being stretched in a direction generally perpendicular to the machine direction, that is, the direction in which the material is initially being worked and stretched into film, as on a plastic mill.Further, the stretching normal to the machine direction can result in opening up of seams in the sheet material and very close observation of such seams will reveal an extensive array of fine fibers which are stretched as the seam is opened. A subsequent pull on the sheet in the machine direction while in readily workable or plastic state can result in an apparent closing up of the seams and restoration of the appearance of a sheet material. However, it is deemed evident from this behavior of certain samples of incompatible polymers which are partially interdispersed that the fibers perform an interlocking or binding function in binding together with fibers of the polytetrafluoroethylene the discrete material s of the incompatible polymers. While such phenomena is observable on a macro scale at an early stage of interdispersion, it is deemed to persist in the micro scale so that the incompatible polymers are not only dispersed into each other, but are effectively interlocked by the fibrous interdispersing and interlocking agent. Evidence of such interlocking is found when an effort is made to separate the elements of the interdispersion by solvent action. In fact, it is the concept of the applicants herein that similar binding together of distinct polymers into a bound or interlocked interdispersion can be accomplished by the other fibromorphous material which have a morphology similar to that of polytetrafluoroethylene and which can be distributed in fine fibrous form into polymer media by the internal shearing action of the polymer strata as the polymer is worked or masticated as it is in milling equipment, high intensity mixing equipment and similar conventional polymer masticating and shearing equipment. Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene and very high molecular weight polyethylene are deemed to be such interdispersing agents for forming interdispersions of polymers. Accordingly, one feature of this invention is to provide a primary intimate admixture and interdispersion of normally incompatible or poorly compatible polymer materials with the aid of fibrous PTFE as described in the samples below and to then subject the interdispersion to a secondary treatment, such as the co grafting or partial cross linking secondary treatment also described in the Example 36 below to alter and modify the properties of the interdispersed ingredients and of the interdispersed composition. One feature of the present invention which must be appreciated to recognize the extraordinary breadth of primary and secondary processing is that the PTFE interdispersing agent used in forming many primary blends of this invention is one of the most chemically inert materials known to polymer science. For a great number of combination of polymers, t has simply not been feasible heretofore to attempt secondary processing to improve the properties and permanence of a primary blend because without the present invention, the formation of the primary blend under a favorable set of conditions as a very intimate and persistent admixture of diverse polymers, which primary blend can undergo very extensive processing while retaining its primary blend integrity, has not been feasible by any other known manner or means. However, such secondary treatment of combinations of extremely diverse polymers is made possible pursuant to the present invention because it is possible to form such very intimate and persistent admixtures as interdispersions by use of the interdispersing agents of the present invention. Concentrations of interdispersing agent from a very low fractional percentage of 0.001 or less to percentages which can be accepted by a composition, without loss of desirable properties of a composition and ranging up to 20 and higher, can be employed Where concentrates are employed higher percentages up to about 35 of PTFE dispersed within an interdispersion of polymers is contemplated as an operable upper range. there the ratio of polymers interdispersed is lower, i.e., 20 80 10 it, 30 70, etc., and the interdispersing agent can be effectively included in the polymer present in the lower concentration, an overall concentration of interdispersing agent well below the 2 level can be employed and still achieve sufficient interdispersion. For example, if a 5 concentration of PTFE is first included into a polymer ingredient such as silicone rubber and the silicone rubber is to be interdispersed into a polyolefin containing no PTFE dispersed therein in a ratio of 10 parts of silicone rubber to 90 parts of polyolefin, then the concentration of the PTFE in the final composition will be at approximately 0.5 level. In the processing of polymers, it is preferred to process at as low a temperature as is consistent with obtaining the results which are desired. Generally speaking, there is an advantage in processing polymers at lower temperatures partly because exposure of plastic or polymer material to higher temperatures can initiate the degradation processes to which most polymers are subject and, accordingly, shorten their useful lives. Accordingly, by use of the interdispersing agent of the present invention as taught in the examples below, the advantage of being able to process and combine such polymeric materials at lower temperatures is made available. As described below in Example 1, a composition having an interdispersed set of polymers as a base was prepared first by high intensity mixing in batch form and then by extruding the composition as a wire insulation onto a conductor to form a cable product. The composition was prepared first as a composition containing no crosslinking agent at a higher temperature and then prepared to include the crosslinking agent at a lower temperature as part of the conventional wire insulation forming process of Example 1. As a separate test of the tendency of the composition of Example 1 to remain interdispersed and to have the normally incompatible ingredients stay together during processing, the interdispersed uncrosslinked composition containing no peroxide crosslinking agent was subjected to an injection molding test to form an injection molded part about three square inches in size. This injection molding was carried out in a Stokes Machine Model 702 1 manufactured byF.J. Stokes Corporation of Philadelphia, PA. For this particular run made with an interdispersed composition of Example 1 without any peroxide present, the machine barrel temperature was 204.50C the mold temperature was 65.50C the mold filling time was 5 seconds and part cooling time before ejection was 50 seconds.It was observed, as pointed out below in Example ,that the composition did retain its homogeneous composition after injection molding and that the normally incompatible ingredients, namely high density polyethylene and ethylene propylene rubber, did remain intimately interdispersed in the injection molded product and were not segregated or laminated sometimes referred to as wdelaminated as a result of the injection molding. The preparation of the composition of Example 1 without a crosslinking agent was carried out with very extensive care to carefully interdisperse the ingredients. Another injection molding test was done on two interdispersed compositions which were not at all optimized as to the degree of interdispersion before being subjected to the injection molding test. The first composition was prepared with 20 parts of polystyrene, 10 parts of low density polyethylene and 1.8 parts of fibrous polytetrafluoroethylene It was milled on a large mill to give a quantity sufficient to form several injection mold samples. The milled composition was removed from the rolls in sheet form and cooled. When cooled, the composition was fairly smoothsurfaced and was removed from the roll with relative ease and with a minor tendency to stick to the roll. The total milling time was about 20 minutes. No attempt was made to optimi ibe degree of inter ispersior.by by time, temperature, agree of PTFE dispersion, concentration of PTFE, secondary treatments, additives of any type other than the conventional antioxidant or by any other proced we, manner or means. The cooled sheet resisted fracture with hand force and a white area developed in an area of the surface before a crack appeared in the area, possibly suggesting fibrous architecture. After the sheeted product was broken with hand for9, it exhibited a high degree of fibrous structure at the break. The fracture surface showed laminar or layerlike structure. The sheeted material was granulated in a conventional granulating machine. The granulated composition was introduced into an injection molding machine and injection molded to form a part corresponding to the injection molded part of Example 1. The product formed had a smooth shiny surface and conformed well to the shape of the mold. The product formed broke with roughly the same degree of hand force as the sheet material. The type of laming found in the broken edge of the sheet material prior to injection molding were also observed in the broken edge of the injection molded material were quite tough in their resistance to fracture and in the evidence of fibrous content and character of the material exposed at a broken edge. In fact, the sheet had a tendency to undergo considerable folding before a break occurred. The evidence that fibers were present was very clear, but it was not determined whether these fibers were solely PTFE or were PTFE associated with the host polymer material. The strong evidence of fibers and the known tendency of PTFE to fillibrate under shear in a polymer medium strongly suggested at least some PTFE fiber presence. This demonstration is deemed to evidence that polytetrafluoroethylene fibers and fiber bundles can go through the high shear of injection molding. It is also possible that the fillibration of the PTFE is enhanced by the high shear which accompanies the injection molding inasmuch as the fillibration is generally enhanced by shear in the host polymer. Accordingly, the present invention provides injection molded articles which have fibrous polytetrafluoroethylene distributed therein. Another interdispersion of. low density polyethylene and polystyrene, specifically one prepared in the lower end of the temperature range for forming such interdispersion using 1.8 parts of PTFE, was made to have 20 parts of low density polyethylene in 80 parts of ptlystyrene. Also, this 20 polyethylene 80 polystyrene interdispersion was repeated using 5 parts of PTFE. These compositions were also prepared for the first time in larger quantity on a larger plastic mill. They were also taken off the mill in sheet form and showed evidence of lamina at the surfaces formed as the sheet was broken. The sheets were granulated and each granulated composition introduced into an injection molding apparatus.The injection molded products formed each had a smooth shiny surface closely conforming to the mold shape. Breaking of the injection molded pieces revealed lamina similar to those of the unmolded sheet material and also strong evidence that the fibrous form of the composition had survived the high shear of the injection molding to form the molded product. The material representing parts PTFE was much more resistant to breakage in both the unmolded mill sheet and the injection molded part. Where the PTFE is initially well distributed in a wholly homogenized interdispersion such as that produced according to Example 1, the applicants have found that for such a wholly homogenized interdispersion provided pursurant to this invention, the injection molding of a relatively small part of the order of a feg scuare inches in size does not result in such a disruption of the homogeneous interdispersion or segregation of the normally incompatible ingredients of the interdispersion so as to cause observable lamina to form in the injection molded part. None of the samples involved in these injection molding experiments had been subjected to any secondary processing. It is contemplated that interdispersion compositions prepared for injection molding should preferably have a degree of dispersion of the fibrous PTFE which is slightly less than optimum so that the additional dispersion of the fibrous PTFE which occurs during the very intense shear of injection molding will bring the dispersion of the fibrousPTFE to an optimum level. It is known that some natural blends based on natural compatibility and alloying of ingredients do form laminar products when subjected to injection molding in the formation of larger parts of more complex shape. However, it is within the scope of this invention to include small amounts of fibrous PTFE in such naturally compatible compositions to aid and assist in the injection molding of such materials to form larger and more complex parts and to reduce the degree of lamination or delmination which can result from such injection molding of larger parts of complex shape. Accordingly, pursuant to this invention and with the aid of the interdispersing agents of this invention, it is feasible to combine distinct polymer materials into a combined form, herein referred to as an interdispersion, which interdispersion exhibits properties which are not exhibited by the individual polymer ingredients of the combination and also which are distinct from the properties exhibited by a mixture formed by processing the same polymer ingredients in essentially the same proportions in the same apparatus and under the same conditions. Uniquely, surprisingly and unexpectedly, the compositions of the present invention can be employed to form an interdispersion of polymers which have different ranges of temperatures at which the materials exhibit plastic or plastic like properties. According to one concept of the present invention, the range in which the material can be deformed and processed and interdispersed under high shear mechanisms, is due to the presence of an extremely high molecular weight polymer, essentially linear1 which in the case of Teflon 6, concommitantly manifests macroscopic and microscopic fibrosity, and which material uniquely disperses in the medium of the plastic host material to exhibit pseudo liquid or pseudo plastic properties and to exhibit these properties through a very broad temperature range up to the temperature at which the unique material itself undergoes decomposition. One of the key points in the operability of this invention employing PTFE at higher temperatures is the npn fusability in the plastic polymer media of the fibrous PTFE on which the process apparently depends. This material, that is, the fibrous PTFZ, can induce an interdispersed polymer material in which it is dispersed to continue to exhibit a plastic behavior at temperatures at which such plastic behavior might not otherwise be exhibited.POLYMER ADDITIVES There are a number of compositions which are polymer materials, which materials may give beneficial properties to other polymer base materials although present only to a relatively low concentrations as a polymer additive to the base material. Pursuant to the present invention, concentrates of such polymeric additives are prepared by incorporating relatively high percentages of the PTFE at least partially in fibrous form in the relatively low concentration of the additive in the base polymer. By relatively low concentration as used herein is meant a concentration of less than 10 . Additives may be included in base polymers to possibly improve a number of different properties. For example, a basis host material may be subject to stress cracking and a relatively low level polymer additive may possibly improve the stress cracking of the basis host material. Similarly, improvement in a property such as mpact resistance may possibly be achievable by inclusion of a polymer additive. Among the polymers which can be interdispersed in each other in multinary combinations and which are deemed to be useful in forming useful insulating compositions are the following Low density polyethylene Polyphenylene oxidesLinear low density polyethy leneEthylene ethyl acrylate rubbersHigh density polyethyleneLow molecular weight poly ethyleneFluorocarbonsEthylene propylene rubbers Silicone polymers, including silicone gums and silicone fluidsPolyvinyl chlorideEthylene vinyl acetate copolymersStyrene butadiene rubber PolystyrenesThermoplastic elastomers Sioplas polymersChlorinated polyethylene Natural rubberPolypropylene ChloroprenePolyetherimide PolycarbonatePolyesters PolymethylmethacrylatePolyamides Polyacetal By inconpatible polymers as used herein is meant polymers which, under G given set cf conditions such as are attainable in conventional polymer processing, do not enter an intimate blend although there may be other conditions usually involving higher energy input at which they may be apparently blended and to some degree which conditions may, for some polymer systems, be attainable in the same conventional polymer processing equipment. While the invention has been described principally with reference to the improvement in the interdispersing to a desired degree of intimacy of contact of poorly compatible materials and also the interdispersing of incompatible materials or of materials which are incompatible under the set of conditions at which blending is attempted, the teaching of this invention extends to the improvement in the combined properties of materials which are blendable or which are naturally compatible. For example, stryrene and polyethylene, when heated to a sufficiently high temperature and mixed together, form what is to the unaided eye an apparent blend of the two materials. For example where 50 parts of polystyrene are milled at 154.5ECwith 50 parts of low density polyethylene, a composition is formed which has the appearance of a blend. However, the same two ingredients when milled in the same proportions at about 115.50C roll tsuperature, do not blend at all, even apparently, but forms flakes of polyethylene. However, the formation of an interdispersion of the same ingredients in the same proportions can be effected by means of the present invention at the much lower temperature of 115.5 1210C. and can further be improved by the addition of the fibrous polytetrafluoroethylene interdispersing agent as part of the interdispersing process. PTFE inrerdispersable as used herein means that the distribution of fibrous PTFE in a set of polymeric materials permits the binding of the polymers into an intimate interlocked interdispersion and or the preservation of such interdispersion under conditions under which a blend or apparent blend would not otherwise form or to persist under conditions under which it would not otherwise persist. In preparing the interdispersed compositions of the present invention, it is sometimes advantageous to have the PTFE well dispersed in a first polymer before the second polymer is added. The level of concentration at which thePTFE affects the properties of the first polymer and permits the interdispersion of a second distinct polymer is quite low.MOLECULAR WEIGHTS The present invention is adapted to the multinary interdispersing of distinct polymers with the aid of fibrousPTFE. The polymers may be organic or inorganic and the interdispersions formed may be interdispersions of organic polymers with other organic polymers, they may be inorganic polymers with other inorganic polymers, or they may be interdispersions of organic polymers with inorganic polymers. As a lower limit, the molecular weight of polymers which are beneficially interdispersable and otherwise processable with the aid of fibrous interdispersing agents of this invention is deemed by the applicants herein to be of the order of 600 to 1000. As used herein, the term copolymer includes terpolymers and other polymers made with more than two monomers.CONCENTRATES The concentrates are compositions in which the percentage of fibrous polytetrafluoroethylene dispersed in a polymeric medium is relatively high. The concentrates are not materials which are necessarily intended for end use application themselves, but rather may be compositions which contain higher levels of the fibrous PTFE and which permit the dispersion of thePTFE in fibrous form into polymeric medium with relative ease of processing. THERMAL HISTORY It is well accepted in the plastics industry that there is an advantage in the processing of polymeric materials through a thermal history which may be referred to for convenience of reference as one having a low profile .What is meant is that if the polymer from the time of its inception in the polymeric state is exposed to and subjected to a thermal history, which is of a low profile type rather than a high profile type i.e., with temperature plotted as ordinate and time as abcissa , that the polymer will have a better chance of retaining its properties and a better chance of avoiding the initiation of the degradative processes to which essentially all polymeric materials are subject. In general terms, the performance of a polymeric product may be inferred to be reciprocably related to the cumulative excessive thermal history that the material has experienced.EXAMPLE 1 A novel cable insulation composition was prepared and a cable and an injection molded part were prepared according to the following example. In all of the examples below, the term parts is used to designate a quantity cf an ingredient by weight based on the weight of the polymer base ingredient of the composition taken as 100. As an example, if the composition contains 500 grams of base polymer and 50 grams of an additive, the content of the composition is stated as 100 parts of polymer and 50 parts of additive. Where the polymer base itself contains more than one polymer, the parts of each polymer ingredient of the base is recited in parts in the proportions they are present in a composition. For example, in this Example, high density polyethylene is present to a 20 percentage level and ethylene propylene diene monomer, EPDM, is present at an 80 percentage level. This is recited as 20 parts of high density polyethylene and 80 parts of EPDM. Accordingly, in the above illustration, if the 500 grams of polymer were 100 grams of high density polyethylene and 400 grams of EPDM, the composition would have a polymer base of 20 parts HDPE and 80 parts EPDM.If the additive were 500 grams of clay particles, the additive would be reported in the examples below as 5 parts of clay particles. Also, if the composition were made up of 400 pounds of EPDM, 100 pounds of HDPE and 50 pounds of clay particles, it would be reported as 20 parts of HDPE, 80 parts of EPDM and 5 parts of clay particles. Accordingly, all quantities of ingredients recited in the examples below in parts may be readily converted to grams or other weight units. In fact, most examples were made on a small laboratory plastic mill and the parts were directly determined from an equivalent number of grams actually weighed out. A set of ingredients and proportions of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed in a high intensity mixing apparatus, such as a Banbury mixer. The ingredients are introduced into the high intensity mixer which is in motion and which has an initial temperature of about 65.50c. The mixing action of the high intensity mixer generates heat in the composition and the composition temperature is measured during the mixing by a thermocouple sensor which is built into the high intensity mixer so that a record of the temperature of the sensor can be observed and recorded as on a chart. When the chart temperature of the composition reaches about 160 c., the composition is dropped from the high intensity mixer through a mechanism built into and normally used for this purpose. The heat which the composition has received during this temperature rise is a heat of mixing and no high temperature external heat need be applied in order to attain this temperature increase. The dropped batch of material, which has a probe temperature measured by an inserted thermocouple of about 71 1820C., is then milled on a plastic mill after removal from the high intensity mixer. The material on the plastic mill is banded on the mill and then taken off as sheets. The sheet product is allowed to cool to lower its general temperature and also the high intensity mixing apparatus is allowed to cool. The sheet material is reintroduced into the high intensity mixer when the mixer temperature is about 150OF. in order that a peroxide cross linking agent may be dispersed into the composition of the sheet material at a temperature lower than the drop temperature of the previously interdispersed material as removed from the high intensity mixer.The dispersing of the crosslinking agent, specifically, a peroxide, is at a lower temperature, below the decomposition temperature of the peroxide crosslinking agent in order to forestall premature crosslinking of the interdispersion of ingredients. The composition with all of the ingredients is mixed in the high intensity mixer at a temperature of approximately 121 1320c. maximum until an apparently homogeneous composition is formed. One unique property of the interdispersed composition, as it is dropped from the high intensity mixer, is its very homogeneous, smooth surface. The composition is observed to have no apparent inclusions of non homogeneous structure and, in this sense, the composition is quite novel and unique, particularly inasmuch as there is no compatibility normally of the high density, highly crystalline polyethylene and the semi crystalline ethylene propylene rubber.Quite unexpectedly and surprisingly, it has been discovered that it is possible to interdisperse together into a homogeneous interdispersion the two incompatible base polymers,namely high density polyethylene and semi crystalline ethylene propylene copolymer, and to do so without any evidence of segregation, delamination, or insufficient mixing, nor of the basic incompatibilities of the base polymer materials, namely high density polyethylene and semi crystalline ethylene propylene rubber. It has been known for many years that by their nature, these materials are incompatible and cannot be mixed to form a homogeneous blend. It has accordingly been discovered that the fibrous fluorocarbon component of the composition is responsible for making it possible to interdisperse the otherwise unblendable high density polyethylene and the ethylene propylene rubber. Following the introduction of tS peroxide cross linking agent into the previously interdispersed compound, it is again rolled on a plastic mill into sheet form from which it can be cut into strips for pelletizing for later use in an extruder. The composition prepared as described above was formed into strips and these strips were cut into pellets in a conventional pelletizing apparatus. The pelleted material was later introduced into an extruder having a 8.9 cm screw with a 15 1 length to diameter ratio. The compression ratio based on the screw design of the extruder was three to one. The pelleted material of this example was introduced into the extruder and the composition was extruded onto a conductor. The composition was extruded onto a t12 AWG 19 strand conductor to form an insulating layer havlng approximately a 0.030 inch 0.76 mm wall thickness. The test specimen identification was ID 92 99 3. Test data was obtained on the sample by conducting a number of tests. The tests were standard tests employed in the industry in this technology. A tensile test which was done on the insulation at 5b.8 cm per minute according to standard industry practice gave an original tensile value of 17.Azg mmi 2488 pounds per square inch . The elongation test performed on the same sample at the 20 inch per minute testing rate gave an elongation value of 414 . The hot modulus of the material was measured according to established industry practice by which the 0 testing sample is subjected to a hot environment of 150 C. for 5 minutes. Then, the force required to stretch the test sample to 100 elongation is measured and the force is computed in psi units as a measure of tensile strength.The hot modulus value found for this product of Example I was 1.72 N mm2 This value of hot modulus is quite surprising, unique and unexpected. To illustrate the novelty of this result, if the hot modulus of a composition containing essentially the same ingredients as that of Example 1 but excluding the PTFE were measured, but the base polymer were entirely the ethylene propylene rubber, it is estimated tht the hot modulus obtained would be approximately 0.689 NySm2. This value is estimated because it has not been possible heretofore to produce a wire insulated with chemically crosslinked hihg density polyethylene without the aid of PTFE.Accordingly, it is very unique and distinctive and surprising to find, when the two materials are used in combination with a minor amount of polytetrafluoroethylene, that a hot modulus of 1.72 N mm2 is found. It is believed that the distinctive hot modulus value is due in part to the fact that the unique interdispersing of the high density polyethylene and the ethylene propylene rubber can be and is accomplished as a novel composition of this invention, but in addition, that there is an influence on the hot modulus which is the result of the presence of the novel and unique interdispersing agent which is employed and, specifically, the polytetrafluoroethylene. Another measurement made on the insulation layer formed on the wire of this example is the heat distortion at 1500C. The heat distortion is a measurement of the distortion of the insulation on the wire when a 500 gram weight is rested on the wire so that an area of the weight according to the established industry standard is bearing on the insulation. This heat distortion test is measured in terms of the percent change in the diameter of the wire with the 500 gram weight bearing on the wire. It was observed for the insulated wire as prepared in Example 1 that the heat distortion was 1.64 , or, the insulation deformed to the extent of 1.64 of the original dimension of the insulated wire.In other words, the wire with the 500 gram weight on it retained 98.36 of its original diameter. Again, it is a reflection of a very unique and novel combination of properties to be found in a single cable insulation to have the high values of tensile and elongation as are found for the cable of Example 1, and at the same time, to have such a low value of heat distortion at the elevated temperature of 1500 C. at which the heat distortion measurement is carried out and made.As an illustration of the significance of this relatively small value of 1.64 distortion at 1500C., it is a fact that the industry standard for an insulated wire of the construction of that provided by Example 1 is a full 20 and, accordingly, a value as provided here of only 1.64 is unusually excellent for a wire construction. Additional tests were conducted concerning the suitability of the wire insulation formed in accordance with the present invention using standard industry tests and it was found that the composition served satisfactorily as a wire insulation.

It is applied to elastomers based on an ethylenepropylene hexadiene terpolymer. A composition containing the same ingredients as set out in Table I above, but excluding the peroxide component, was prepared for injection molding by the compounding procedure using the high intensity mixer as described above The composition was first mixed in a high intensity mixer followed by banding on a mill roll. The material was taken off the mill as strip and diced in a conventional dicing machine. The diced material was fed to an injection molding machine and injection molded as described above to form an injection molded part of about three squre inches area and one eighth inch thickness. The product formed was highly pliable and had substantial integrity.EXAMPLE 2 The composition as described in Example 1 was prepared but the PTFE was omitted. The composition was placed in a high intensity mixer, specifically a Banbury mixer, and an effort was made to blend the ingredients as listed inExample 1 with the exception of the PTFE ingredient. After an extended period of mixing at essentially the same temperature conditions and time as described inExample 1, the material was dropped from the Banbury in bulk form and appeared in bulk to be adequately mixed. After the first Banbury mixing, the composition was put on the mill in order to form sheet of the product and it was there observed that the material was obviously not homogeneously mixed as evident from the roughness of the texture of the material and the surface dryness of the material and also the aspersities observed in the material. Nevertheless, the material was formed into a sheet and the sheet was taken off the mill having a rough texture, very different from that observed in the similar step of Example 1.The sheeted material was then placed back in the Banbury mixer at a lower temperature and the peroxide additive as well as the silicone fluid additive were included in the high intensity mixer for blending into the composition. After further high intensity mixing at the lower temperature, the composition was dropped from theBanbury and again appeared in bulk to have the ingredients mixed together satisfactorily. The dropped composition was placed on a mill and milled to sheet form. The sheet material on the mill again appeared to have quite a rough texture and a dry surface and was far inferior in its appearance to the composition at the same stage as recited in Example 1. The composition was taken off the mill as strip and the strip was diced in a conventional dicing apparatus.The diced composition was introduced into an extruder and the composition was extruded onto wire to form an insulation. It was observed that the insulation layer formed by the extruder was quite uneven and lumpy and had an irregular surface which made it quite unsatisfactory for use as a cable insulation layer. The tensile strength of the layer of material was tested after a sample was removed from the wire surface. The tensile measurement indicated that the tensile strength was less than 8.27 N mm2 and, accordingly, only about one half of what was required in the way of tensile strength for a cable to be applied to the uses for which this cable was intended. The very poor results obtained in the tensile test and the very poor appearance and the surface roughness, lumpiness and unevenness of the cable insulation indicated that it was not worth running further tests on this cable insulation based on prior experience in dealing with the insulations of many different cables.EXAMPLE 3A A set of ingredients, given in proportions of parts by weight, are set forth in Table II. The ingredients, other than the peroxide, are introduced into a high intensity mixer which has been preheated to a temperature 65.5 C. and are mixed in the apparatus for a period of time sufficient to achieve a good blend and to raise the temperature of the blend due to the imparting of a heat of mixing to the composition as the high intensity mixer operates. When the chart temperature of the composition reaches about 160 c., the composition is dropped from the high intensity mixer through a mechanism built into and normally used for this purpose. The heat which the composition has received during this temperature rise is the heat of mixing as in Example I, and no high temperature external heat need be applied in order to attain this temperature increase. The dropped batch of material which has a probe temperature measured by an inserted thermocouple of about 171 1820C., is then milled on a plastic mill after removal from the high intensity mixer. The material on the plastic mill is banded and taken off as sheets. The sheet product is allowed to cool and the blending apparatus is also allowed to cool. The sheet material is reintroduced into the high intensity mixing apparatus when the apparatus has a temperature of about 65.50C.,and a composition containing 3 parts per hundred of dicumyl peroxide is added to the composition in the mixer. The contents of the high intensity mixer are mixed and the composition temperature rises due to the heat of mixing which is imparted thereto.The peroxide containing composition ingredients are mixed into the composition and the temperature is allowed to rise to approximately 115,50C., but not to higher temperatures in order to avoid premature decomposition of the dicumyl peroxide. The composition is mixed in the high intensity mixer to form an interdispersion of the low density polyethylene and the ethylene propylene diene monomer, EPDM. Accordingly, this example provides another demonstration of the unique capability of the interdispersing process of this invention to bring together what are otherwise and what are normally incompatible polymer materials in proportions which are incompatible, to yield interdispersions and to generate unique materials which have a high degree of homogeniety. Following the introduction of the peroxide containing material and the removal of the compound from the high intensity mixer, it is again rolled on a plastic mill into sheet form and cut into strips for pelletizing for later use in an extruder. The pelletized material which was prepared from the composition of this example was later introduced into the extruder which was described and used in Example I above.The peileted material was run through the extruder and extruded onto a num 12 AWG conductor formed of 19 strands. The insulation layer deposited on this conductor had a thickness of approximately 0.76 mm 0.030 inches . The test specification identification number was ID 92 89 6. Tests were run on the wire thus prepared and test data was obtained and the test results are set forth in the accompanying Table II.EXAMPLE 3B The composition prepared as described in Example 3A was employed to extrude an insulation layer on a 12 AWG stranded conductor having 19 single strands. The thickness of the insulation layer was 1.14 mm 45 mils . The insulation thus formed was tested and the tensile and elongation values obtained were 12.9 N mm2 and 294 percent, respectively. The sample was tested for crush and abrasion resistance and values of crush of 1569.5 kg and abrasion resistance of 1171 cycles were found.EXAMPLE 3C The composition prepared as described in Example 3A was also used to extrude an insulation coating of 1.9 mm onto a conductor designated as an MCM 313 7950 circular mm conductor. An insulation layer of 1.9 mm was deposited on the conductor. This layer successfully insulated the conductor.EXAMPLE 3D The composition prepared as described in Example 3A was extruded onto a conductor of 646 MCM 16408.4 circular mm . The insulation layer deposited was 2.28 mm. A successful insulation of the larger conductor was accomplished. As used herein, a circular mil is a unit of measurement for the thickness of wires. It is equal to an area of a circle with a diameter of 1 mil 0.0254 irk . A wire or conductor can be described in terms of the number of circular mils circular mm which it contains. The designation MCM as used herein means thousand circular mils. In other words, it is a measure of a conductor having a cross sectional area of one thousand circular mils as the definition of circular mil is given above. If a conductor is 313 MCM, that means that it has 313,000 circular mils 7950 circular rtra in its cross section. This is the cross sectional area of actual conductor and does not en compass the overall outer dimensions of the conductor nor the space between individual strands of the conductor, but rather is a measure of the total cross section of conductor in the cable independently of the stranding or strand size or conductor size of the cable.

The composition was placed in a high intensity mixer, specifically a Banbury mixer, and an effort was made to blend the ingredients as lneted in Example 3A with the exception of the PTFE ingredient. After an extended period of mixing at essentially the same temperature conditions and time as described inExample 3A, the material was dropped from the Banbury and appeared in bulk to be adequately mixed. After the firstBanbury mixing, the composition was put on the mill in order to form sheet of the product and it was there observed that the material was obviously not well or homogeneously mixed as evident from the roughness of the texture of the material and also the aspersities observed in the material. Nevertheless, the material was formed into a sheet and the sheet was taken off the mill having a rough texture, very different from that observed in the similar step of Example 3A. The sheeted material was then placed back in the Banbury mixer at a lower temperature and the peroxide additive material was included in the high intensity mixer for blending into the composition. After further high intensity mixing at the lower temperature, the composition was dropped from the Banbury and again appeared in bulk to have the ingredients mixed together satisfactorily The dropped composition was placed on a mill and milled to strip form. The material on the mill again appeared to have quite a rough texture and a dry surface and was far inferior in its appearance to the composition at the same stage as recited in Example 3A. The composition was taken off the mill as strip and the strip was diced in a conventional dicing apparatus.The diced composition was introduced into an extruder and the composition was extruded onto wire to form an insulation. It was observed that the insulation layer formed by the extruder was quite uneven and lumpy and had an irregular surface which made it quite unsatisfactory for use as a cable insulation layer. The tensile strength of the layer of material was tested after a sample was removed from the wire surface. The tensile measurement indicated that the tensile strength was less than 800 psi and, accordingly, only about one third of what was required in the way of tensile strength for a cable to be applied to the uses for which this cable was intended. The very poor results obtained in the tensile test and the very poor appearance and the surface roughness, lumpiness and unevenness of the cable insulation indicated that it was not worth running further tests on this cable insulation based on prior experience in dealing with the insulations of many different cables.EXAMPLE 5A EPR LDPE EPR HDPE 90 10 The ingredients other than the peroxide containing material were introduced into a high intensity mixer preheated to a temperature of about 1500C. essentially as described in Example 3. No PTFE was included in this specific composition.After thorough mixing, the composition was dropped from the mixer at a temperature of about 143.3.0C. The composition was observed to be relatively coarse and rough in its surface characteristics, indicating that the complete and intimate intermixing of the ingredients, which had apparently occurred in Example 3, had not occurred in the material of this Example SA. There was, however, a low degree of apparent blending, evidently due to the fact that the percentage of the low density polyethylene was relatively low in this composition and that the EPDM, i.e., the Nordels 2722 ingredient, has an ability to accept and blend with a relatively small amount of the low density polyethylene without the aid of any agent.The presence of the fillers and additives in the composition apparently does aid in establishing an apparent blend. In the absence of these fillers and additives, the degree of blending is not nearly as high and a certain amount of delmination or separation of the polymer components is expected for the unfiled composition. The dropped compound was put on a mill and taken off in sheet form for later reintroduction into the high intensity mixer. The high intensity mixer was allowed to cool to about 65.50and the sheets of compound were introduced into the mixer together with peroxide as shown in the TableIII. The composition formed from this high intensity mixing had a final temperature of below approximately 115.50C. to avoid the premature decomposition of the peroxide. The composition was placed on a mill and taken off in sheets and the sheets were processed through a conventional dicing machine t form pellets of the peroxide containing compound. The compound pellets were introduced into an extruder and the compound was extruded onto a 12 AWG 19 strand conductor to form an insulating wall on the conductor having dimensions of approximately 0.76 mn. This wire and its insulation were immediately passed into a conventional high temperature, high pressure curing chamber and were exposed to the saturated steam of the chamber for a time sufficient to cause decomposition of the peroxide and the crosslinking of the polymer components of the composition. The crosslinked wire product was removed from the chamber through a water seal in the conventional manner.EXAMPLE 53 The procedure as carried out above was repeated for sample 5B with the exception that although all of the other ingredients and ingredient concentrations were essentially the same as used in Example 5A, 1.5 parts of Teflon 6 were added to the composition to form composition SB. The blending procedure was carried out as described with reference to Example 5A and it was observed that a very smooth, creamy, apparently homogeneous interdispersion of ingredients was formed from the initial mixing and was further formed from the additional mixing with the peroxide containing ingredient. There was a very noticeable difference in the appearance of the composition prepared by this Example SB, particularly in the surface appearance of the compound as the compound was much more uniform and smooth in its surface appearance, and in its internal appearance when subjected to a cutting than the composition of Example SA. The smoother surface appearance and smoother working of the compound was also observable on the mill as the compound was being sheeted preparatory to dicing. Following the preparation of the composition, it was extruded on a wire as described in Example 5A, and tests were conducted on the wire insulation. The abrasion test resulted in a finding of a value of 399 cycles as compared to the 235 cycles found for Example 5A. This resulted in an increase of approximately 70 in the abrasion resistance of the wire. This increase in the abrasion resistance was attributed to the addition of 1.5 parts of the Teflon 6 and to the increased homogeneity of the composition which resulted from the addition of the 1.5 parts of the Teflon 6.EXAMPLE SC The procedures recited with regard to Examples SA and 5B were repeated but, in this case, with the addition of 3 parts of Teflon 6 to the composition as compared to the 1.5 parts in Example 5B and 0 parts in Example 5A. Again, a much more homogeneous and smooth surface composition was found in Example 5C as compared to that from Example SA. The composition was extruded onto a wire to form a 0.76 rrm wall thickness. An abrasion resistance value of 577 was found on testing and represents an increase over that found for Sample 58 of about 45 and represents an increase in abrasion resistance over Sample 5A of approximately 145 . Accordingly, this provides a very dramatic illustration of the extraordinary and remarkable influence of the addition of very small amounts of the Teflon 6 agent to compositions which are used in specific end use applications illustratively in this case in wire insulation. The applicants believe that these improvements could be imparted to other products and other polymer systems used in other end use applications as, for example, in tires. This conclusion is presented on the basis of these examples and on the awareness of the inventors that the abrasion resistance is associated with wear resistance and that by the addition of relatively small percentages of polyethylene, such as the low density polyethylene of Examples 5A, 5B and 5C, or the high density polyethylene of Example 5D below, dramatic increases in the wear resistance 8 rubber articles such as tires may be achieved where the relatively low percentage addition of the polyolefin is accompanied by the addition of a very small amount of the uniquely fibrous fluorocarbon blending agent taught in this invention. In addition to the observation of the improvement in the abrasion resistance, there is also observation of an increase in the tensile and an increase in the elongation properties of the material with the addition of small quantities of the uniquely fibrous fluorocarbon agent to form an interdispersion of a smaller portion of polyethylene in a larger portion of the ethylene propylene rubber base polymerEXAMPLE 5D The composition as described in Example 5A, 5B andSC was prepared, but with a modification in its polymer content.In fact, the composition is identical with that inExample 5B except that the 10 parts of low density polyethylene of Example SB was replaced with 10 parts of high density polyethylene and, specifically, 10 parts of high density polyethylene identified commercially as TR 955 of thePhillips Company. This high density polyethylene had a density of 0. 955 and a melt index of 8. The composition of this Example 5D also contained the 1.5 parts of euorocarbon. After a wire was coated with the composition as described in the Example 5D, the wire insulation was tested for abrasion resistance and a value of abrasion resistance obtained is shown in Table III. It is evident that the abrasion resistance with the high density polyethylene is substantially higher than that with the low density polyethylene for the same percentage of polyethylene intermixed in the EPR and for the same quantity of PTFE interdispersing agent. Specifically, the value of 928 for the composition 5D containing 10 HDPE is approximately 132 greater than the abrasion resistance for the composition of Example 5B containing 108 LDPE.In addition, it is approximately 300 greater specifically, 295 than the value found for the composition of Example 5A and, accordingly, the abrasion resistance value measured by the same test for the composition 5D shows a remarkable increase in abrasion resistance from the addition of the relatively small percentage of approximately 10 parts of high density polyethylene and the relatively small quantity of approximately 1.5 parts of Teflon 6 to the rubber base polymer, i.e., to the EPDM. It should be pointed out that although there is some tolerance of the rubber for low density polyethylene, and a certain small percentage of low density polyethylene can be incorporated in the rubber, although without achieving the total homogeniety, nevertheless, the rubber, particularly the EPDM, is essentially incompatible in the higher ratios both with the low density polyethylene of, Examples 5B and 5C, and with high density polyethylene of the character employed in this Example SD.It would not be possible to combine 10 parts of high density polyethylene with 90 parts of EPDM using conventional processing equipment and procedures even with all of the ingredients thecther additives of the Examples 5A 5D because of the basic incompatibility of these materials in this higher ratio. Accordingly, it is very significant and unique that this homogeneous interdispersion of the combination of materials has been achieved with the aid of the PTFE interdispersing agent.

The compositions were prepared essentially as2escribed in Example 5 and each contained 1.5 parts of Teflon 6. The compositions were, in fact, quite similar to the composition of Example SD in that the combination of high density polyethylene and an EPDM copolymer were interdispersed according to Example SD and according to this example. In Example 5D, 10 parts of the high density polyethylene were employed whereas in this example 20 and 30 parts of the EPDM were employed. The testing of the peroxide crosslinked composition, which had been extruded onto wire as described in Example SD, gave abrasion test values of 1135 strokes and 1471 strokes, respectively, for the interdispersed composition containing 1.5 parts of PTFE and 20 parts of high density polyethylene and 1.5.parts of PTFE and 30 parts of high density polyethylene. Accordingly, it is seen that the most rapid increase in the abrasion resistance of the interdispersed composition which results from the interdispersion of the high density polyethylene occurs with the first 10 addition of high density polyethylene into the interdispersed composition aided by the 1.5 parts of PTFE interdispersing agent. It is to be understood from the foregoing, however, that the insulation can comprise a coating on any portion of a conductive element and that the insulation need not completely enclose the element where such is not necessary for a desired insulative effect.
