## Abstract
It comprises a rotatable and retractable storage lug 50 equipped with a rotatable and slidable weight cylinder as sembly 76 and 64 in coaxial relationship with a pivoted sup port beam 60 . The weight cylinder assembly 76 and 64 and support beam 60 are connected together by a lockable channel 70 and 70A , groove 68 and 68A and pin 62 and 62A arrangement. By rotating the cylinder 64 , the support beam 60 will assume either a horizontal or working position or a vertical or stored position. A plurality of the lugs 50 may be affixed, for example, to an indexing fixture 40 to enable the fixture to be stored on a plenum assembly 16 of a nuc lear reactor to reduce floor storage space requirements and downtime when the reactor is disassembled for refuelling, in ternal inspection and or maintenance.
