# Modular electrical heater.

## Abstract
A self regulating heater comprising a pair of flexible elon gate parallel conductors 40 which are connectable to a power supply, and a plurality of rigid heating modules connected in parallel with each other between the conductors. Preferably, each of the heating modules comprises a PTC resistive heating component which has been deposited on the substrate 32 and which generates heat when the conductors are connected to a suitable power supply.
