# Attachment construction for the attachment of a woven filter to a press plate of a cocoa press.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the attachment of a filter mat 10 , woven from stainless steel wire, to a press plate 8 of a cocoa press. It is known to insert the bent over edge of part of the mat 10 into a groove 15 in the press plate 8 and fix it by means of a pressed in cord 19 . In order to avoid the mat being broken at the place of bending, it is proposed according to the invention that the opposite walls 16, 17 of the groove against which the peripheral edge of the filter mat 10 and the cord 19 are pressed should form an angle between 25 and 55 with the surface of the press plate.
