Svnthesis As shown in Equation 1, the compounds of Formula I can be prepared by reacting an appropriately substituted carbamimidothioic acid salt of Formula II with an alkylating agent of Formula III Equation I EMI4.1 EMI4.2 add the isothiocyanate to a stirred suspension of the aminoheterocycle. Since such isothiocyanates usually are liquids, their addition is more easily controlled.Catalysts, such as 1,4 diazabicyclo 2.2.2 octane or dibutyltindilaurate, may be used. In some cases, sulfonylthioureas ofFormula IV are more conveniently prepared, as shown in Equation 3, by reacting an appropriately substituted sulfonamide of Formula VII with the appropriate 2 isothiocyanatoheterocycle of Formula VIII R1, X,Y and Z being as previously defined EMI5.1 The preparation of 2 isothiocyanatobetero cycles VIII is taught in Japanese patent Kokai 51 143686. The preparation of the sulfonyl thioureas IV and reactants therefor is described in said United Patent Specification No. 4,127,4n5, the contents of which in that connection are incorporated herein by reference. The compounds of Formula I may also be prepared as shown in Equation 4. This is the preferred procedure for Z N.Equation 4EMI5.2 reaction mixture was refluxed for 0,5 hour, whereupon 5,5 g of Methyl iodide in 10 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added. After refluxing for an additional 4 hours the reaction mixture was cooled, solvent was removed under vacuum, and the residue recrystallized from acetonitrile to afford 6.5 g of methyl N 2 chlorophenylsulfonyl N 4,6 dimethoxypyrimidin 2 yl carbamimidothioate, m.p. 169 171 C. EXAMPLE 3 Methyl N 2 chlorophenylsulfonyl N 4 methoxy 6methylpyrimidin 2 yl carbamimidothioate To a suspension of 11.2 g of N 14 methoxy methylpyrimidin 2 yl arninothioxomethyl 2 chloro benzenesulfonamide in 150 ml of anhydrous tetrahydro furan was added 13.0 ml of 3M NaOCH3 MeOH solution.The reaction mixture was refluxed for 0.5 hour, whereupon 5.5 g of methyl iodide in 10 ml of an hydros tetrahydrofuran was added. After refluxing for an addltional 4 hours, the reaction mixture was cooled, solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue was recrystallized from acetonitrile to afford 8.6 g of methyl N 2 chlorophenylsulfonyl N 4 methoxy 6methylpyrimidin 2 yl carbamimidothioate, m.p. 160 1620C. EXAMPLE 4 Methyl N 2,5 dimethoxyphenylsulfonyl N 4 methoxy 6 methyl 1,3,5 triazine 2 yl carbomimidothioate 1.4 grams of 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methyltriazine was dissolved in a mixture of 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 60 ml of dimethylformamide. 0.48 grams of sodium hydride 50Z mineral oil dispersion was added. The reaction was stirred until hydrogen evolution ceased. 2.75 grams of N 2,5 dirnethoxyphenylsulfonyl carbonimidodithoic acid, S,S dimethyl ester was added all at once.The reaction mixture was stirred 24 hours at ambient temperature.The mixture was poured into 300 ml of water and acidified to a pH of 5 with 20 hydrochloric acid. The mixture was filtered.The crude solid obtained was crystallized from ethyl acetate to yield 1.1 grams of product with m.p. 168 1690.
