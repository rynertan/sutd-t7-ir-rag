# Improved process for preparing polyarylates, polymers obtained by this process and blends of these polymers with thermoplastic polymers.

## Abstract
Described herein is an improved process for preparing a polyarylate having a reduced viscosity of from about 0.5 to greater than 1.0 dl gm which process comprises the follow ing steps a reacting an acid anhydride derived from an acid contain ing from 2 to 8 carbon atoms with at least one dihydric phenol to form the corresponding diester and b reacting said diester with at least one aromatic dicar boxylic acid at a temperature sufficient to form the polyary late, wherein the improvement comprises removing residual acid anhydride, after formation of the dihydric phenol diester, so that its concentration is less than about 1500 parts per million. Thenovel polyarylates produced by the im proved process of this invention are melt stable and low in color.
