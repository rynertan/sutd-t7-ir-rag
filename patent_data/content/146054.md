# Method of and apparatus for forming element free spaces in continuous slide fastener chain with fly strips.

## Abstract
In a method of and apparatus 20 for forming element free spaces 11 in a continuous slide fastener chain 10 at ends 12a, 12b of successive fly strips 12 sewn to the slide fastener chain having interengaged rows of coupling elements 13 , portions of the rows of coupling elements 13 to be re moved are detected by a sensor assembly 31 before each of the portion arrives at a gap forming device 22 . The sensor assembly 31 first determines whether the longi tudinal extent of a space 17, 18 provided between the con fronting ends 12b, 12a of an adjacent pair of the fly strips 12 is larger than a predetermined distance, and then on the bases of the determination, controls the feeding of the chain 10 and the operation of the gap forming device 22 so that the ele ment fre spaces 12 can be provided accurately at the ends 12a, 1 2b of the respective fly strips 12 regardless of the spacing between adjacent fly strips.
