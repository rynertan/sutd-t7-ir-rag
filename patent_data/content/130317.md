## Abstract
A power assist apparatus 18 having a first shell 32 connected to a second shell 34 by a twist lock arrangement 41 . The shells 32 and 34 are made of a light weight and flexible material such that when subjected to temperatures above 49 C the pressure differential created by vacuum on the inside of the shells 32 34 and atmospheric pressure on the outside of the shells 32 34 a crushing force is produced that urges the end 33 of the shell 32 toward shell 34 . A plurality of struts 98 located between the shells 32 34 resists this crushing force to maintain the minimum spacial relationship between shells 32 34 .
