# Postal matter sorting method and system.

## Abstract
A letter sorting machine LSM system of the invention has a plurality of LSMs, each having a feeder 1 , a reader 4 , horizontal convey paths 8a, 8b, 8c , bins 10 with a push out mechanism 7 , an elevator mechanism 17 , a separating mechanism 26 for separating the postal matter from the trays, a destination label printer 28 , and a bundling machine 73 . These LSMs are connected to a centralized system controller 77 . The centralized system controller 77 has a computer 91 and a magnetic disk 97 for storing a schedule for determining the mode of each LSM. The computer 91 reads out the schedule table from the magnetic disk 97 and controls the modes of the LSMs for performing the primary or secondary sortation according to the kinds and amount of the postal matter to be sorted.
