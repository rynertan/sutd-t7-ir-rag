# Pneumatic tire.

## Abstract
A pneumatic tire 10 having better aerodynamic charac teristics than conventionally shaped tires is disclosed. A radial cross section of the tire has an external contour on each side of its mid circumferential plane, exclusive of indicia on the sidewalls 20 or traction elements of the tread portion 18 , that extends continuously axially outwardly and radially inwardly to the point e,e¹ where the external surface of each sidewall intersects a radially extending line A,A¹ , that is tangent to the axially outer edge of a retaining flange 16 of a rim 12 that the tire is mountable upon, with a portion of the external contour on each side of the mid circumferential plane at least approximating an ellipse. The external surfaces of the sidewalls do not extend more than 2.54 millimeters 0.1 inch axially outwardly of the axially outer edge of the retaining flange of the rim at any location.
