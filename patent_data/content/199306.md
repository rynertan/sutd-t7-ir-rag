## Description
This invention relates to silver halide wash off films. More particularly this invention relates to silver halide wash off films containing synthetic amphoteric polymers. The use of synthetic amphoteric polymers in photographic silver halide emulsions is known. Hollister et al. U.S. Patent 3,749,577 discloses a photographic silver halide emulsion containing polymers prepared by direct polymerization of monomers having a carboxyl functionality, e.g., acrylic acid, and monomers having a quaternary ammonium functionality. Hollister et al. U.S. Patent 3,813,251 discloses such a use for similar polymers having a tertiary ammonium functionality. Smith et al U.S. Patent 3,692,753 discloses a silver halide emulsion containing amphoteric polymers of, e.g., N,N dimethyl and N,N diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, and acrylamides or acrylates having thioalkyl groups in the alkyl chain. U.K. Patent Specification 889,760 discloses light sensitive emulsions to which are added synthetic amphoteric polymers prepared by hydrolysis of polymers containing groups capable of producing acidic and basic groups on hydrolysis. Assignee s patent application Serial No. 377,373, US A 474 97 62 filed May 12, 1982, discloses specified synthetic amphoteric polymers which can be added during the precipitation of silver halide emulsions and serve as a partial or complete replacement for gelatin. In the above United States patents the presence of a synthetic amphoteric polymer acts as a peptizing agent in the precipitation and ripening step during the preparation of a photographic silver halide emulsion. In the United Kingdom patent the addition of amphoteric polymers during silver halide emulsion preparation is said to improve the emulsion, e.g. high silver concentration and the silver halide from such emulsions can be rapidly washed and finally redispersed. Assignees application Serial No. 377,373, filed May 12, 1983 discloses the preparation of specified synthetic amphoteric polymers which can serve as a partial or complete replacement for the gelatin binder of a silver halide emulsion. It is desirable to provide a wash off film for tanning development having one or more gelatin layers, including a silver halide emulsion layer, wherein a portion of the gelatin is replaced by a water soluble synthetic amphoteric polymer wherein upon imagewise exposure and development a sharper wash off image is obtained. In accordance with this invention there is provided a wash off film for tanning development comprising at least one gelatin containing layer of which at least one gelatin containing layer is a silver halide emulsion with a gelatin binder, the improvement wherein 5 to 60 by weight of the gelatin in at least one of the gelatin containing layers is replaced with a water soluble synthetic acrylic amphoteric polymer containing at least one of each of three constituents a carboxylic acid, b primary amine, and c secondary and or tertiary amine, whereby a sharper wash off image is obtained by incorporation of the amphoteric polymer. In accordance with another aspect of this invention there is provided a process for preparing a wash off film for tanning development which comprises The preparation of wash off films is known from disclosures such as United States Patents 2,596,576 3,353,958 3,364,024 3,440,049 3,453,111 3,615,529 3,856,524 4,076,531 4,233,392 4,427,757 and 4,456,676, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. In common, these references disclose the use of unhardened gelatin as the binder for wash off films in which tanning development takes place to harden the gelatin in proximity with developing silver. Unhardened gelatin is then washed away to produce the wash off image. It has been discovered that sharper wash off images can be produced when from 5 to 60 by weight, preferably 10 to 20 by weight of gelatin binder is replaced with a water soluble synthetic acrylic amphoteric polymer containing at least one each of three constituents a carboxylic acid, b primary amine, and c secondary and or tertiary amine. The amphoteric polymers have an isoelectric point of 4 to 8, preferably 5 to 7 and have a number average molecular weight in the range of 18,000 to 150,000. Number average molecular weights One or more constituents can be present in the amphoteric polymer as nonfunctional groups, e.g., methyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, etc. The term consisting essentially of does not preclude the presence of the nonfunctional groups as long as they do not affect the operability of the invention. Throughout the specification, including the examples below, the letter designations for the constituents of the amphoteric polymers are as follows By way of illustration a method for producing the first amphoteric polymer listed above is as follows The acrylic prepolymers represented by reaction 1 above, may be made using a continuous flow reactor or by a batch process. Two or more monomers may be used in the polymerization using initial or staged addition. Preferably, the polymerization step is carried out by emulsion techniques because the reaction proceeds more rapidly in this manner than by solution techniques. Emulsion polymerization can be carried out by known procedures, preferably using potassium persulfate as the polymerization initiator. Polymerization temperature is preferably about 50 to 70 C although with a redox initiator system, e.g, potassium persulfate N,N dimethylaminoethanol, temperatures as low as about 0 C can be used. The polymerization can be accomplished by batch or continuous processes. An expanding batch process with specific, gradual, controlled addition of monomer, initiator and emulsifier solution, and a continuous overflow process are preferred. Such procedures are more fully described in the Examples below. Useful monomers containing secondary or tertiary amine groups may be prepared by a transesterification reaction between methyl methacrylate and a secondary or tertiary amine compound which contains an alcohol functionality, such as that represented by reaction 4 below Tertiary amine monomers may alternatively be prepared by reaction between isocyanatoethyl methacrylate and a tertiary amine compound which contains an alcohol functionality, such as that represented by reaction 5 below During the hydrolysis step, represented by reaction 2 above, acrylate ester groups are rapidly converted to carboxylate salt groups in the presence of a base. Since this hydrolysis reaction is several orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding hydrolysis of methacrylate ester groups, selective hydrolysis of the acrylate ester groups can be achieved. If a limiting quantity of base is used, hydrolysis will proceed only until the base is consumed. Hence the degree of prepolymer hydrolysis and therefore the ratio of carboxyl to N substituted aminoalkyl groups in the amphoteric polymer can be regulated by the relative quantity of base used. Basic hydrolysis of the acrylic prepolymer is preferably carried out with aqueous potassium hydroxide, preferably in about a 10 to 20 percent solution of the base and preferably at a temperature of about 65 to 90 C. Neutralization of the hydrolyzed polymer can be accomplished with a strong acid, e.g., nitric acid, and the polymer can be separated from solution by isoelectric precipitation in excess water. The resulting amphoteric prepolymer can be redissolved, after purification, at a pH other than the isoelectric point. Alternatively, prepolymer neutralization can be accomplished with an acidic ion exchange resin. Slightly less than the calculated amount of resin is usually employed to facilitate separation of the amphoteric prepolymer solution which can be used directly, if desired. Pendant primary amine groups are inserted into the amphoteric polymer by reacting carboxylic acid groups derived from the above hydrolysis step with ethyleneimine or propyleneimine as represented by reaction 3 above. The polymer can be purified by coagulation in acetone and redissolving in water. Ion exchange can be used for still further purification. The synthetic amphoteric polymers useful in the present invention are water soluble and are used as a cobinder with gelatin to produce wash off films with improved image sharpness. Such gelatin and amphoteric polymer cobinders can be used in one or more layers of a wash off film containing a silver halide emulsion, carbon black or other pigment and an incorporated developer. A preferred wash off film contains in addition to an amphoteric acrylic polymer as part of the binder a stabilized carbon black dispersion. With such a film the advantage of the present invention is observed after tanning development and wash off of the untanned areas of the film. With from 5 to 60 by weight, preferably 10 to 20 by weight, of the gelatin replaced by the polymer, a sharper image of higher resolution is observed in which the sidewalls of the wash off image are more uniform than the more ragged sidewalls of control films containing only gelatin as the binder. It has been found that when other constituents are kept constant that better image sharpness is observed when the amphoteric polymer contains acrylic acid rather than methacrylic acid and APA instead of AEMA. Without limiting the invention it is postulated that the improvement is due to the nongelling characteristics of the polymers which could provide for cleaner breakage of the cobinder combination than would be possible with gelatin alone, and that the primary amine groups of the amphoteric polymer provide increased crosslinking in the tanned areas. A preferred embodiment is described in Example 1. The following are illustrative procedures and examples of the invention in which all parts and percentages are by weight and all degrees are Celsius unless otherwise noted. Polymer isoelectric points pI were determined by titration of a dilute polymer solution from the acidic and basic sides of the pI until cloudiness was observed. The pI was taken as the halfway point between the two cloud points. At the isoelectric point, the polymers are least water soluble and precipitation of the polymers occurs. All reactors and reservoirs were flushed with nitrogen, and solutions were maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere. An emulsifier solution was prepared with 500 ml water, 5 g Triton QS 30 surfactant, and 0.5 g K‚ÇÇS‚ÇÇO‚Çà. The solution pH was adjusted to 7 and the solution was placed in the reactor and heated to 60 C in a constant temperature bath. Methyl acrylate and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate monomers were slowly added over a period of one hour to the reaction mixture from an addition funnel during the reaction cycle. The prepolymer so formed was coagulated with acetone, washed and dissolved overnight in ethanol to produce a cloudy solution. The prepolymer was hydrolyzed with KOH and then acidified to pH 5.5 with nitric acid. The final product was prepared by reacting with propyleneimine. The polymer showed a pI 4.0 by precipitation but remained cloudy throughout the entire pH range. A jacketed resin kettle was fitted with a stirrer, nitrogen bubbler, condenser and addition funnel. Kettle temperature was regulated by circulating water from a constant temperature water bath through the kettle jacket. To the kettle was added 200 milliliters of ethanol and 3.6 milliliters of nitric acid, 10.0 grams acrylic acid, 6.85 g methyl acrylate, 5.18 g 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 7.93 g morpholinoethyl methacrylate, and 0.5 ml mercaptoethanol as chain transfer agent . After heating the reaction mixture to 65 degrees with stirring, a 50 milliliter aqueous solution containing 2. 5 grams of potassium persulfate was added dropwise over a one hour period. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated for about four hours, then allowed to cool to room temperature. To the cooled reaction mixture was added, in order, 4.84 grams potassium hydroxide and 2.52 milliliters propyleneimine. The reaction mixture was heated to 60 degrees for 2 hours, then cooled. The polymeric product was isolated from the reaction mixture by coagulating in acetone. The coagulated polymer solution was dissolved in water and purified further by passing through a mixed bed ion exchange resin. Using both batch and continuous reaction methods a variety of other acrylic amphoteric polymers were prepared. Table 1 details the polymeric compositions prepared and measured pI values of some of the amphoteric polymers. A 3 liter jacketted reaction kettle was fitted with an overflow tube and heated with water circulated from a 4 liter kettle thermostatically controlled at 55 60 C. The reaction kettle was also equipped with a stirrer and stainless steel nitrogen, emulsifier, monomer and initiator feed lines. Stock solutions and associated pump rates were To start the synthesis, 2500 ml emulsifier solution was heated, with stirring, in the reactor kettle to 55 60 C. After the temperature stabilized, the emulsifier and initiator feeds were started and allowed to run for ten minutes. The monomer precharge was then injected with a syringe and the monomer feed started. The reactant solution flowing out of the reaction kettle was coagulated in a 4 liter bucket containing ice. The polymer was separated from the emulsifier monomer solution by decanting and washed several times with water. The polymer portion collected while the system equilibrated during the first 20 minutes was discarded. Further portions were collected and washed at 20 30 minute intervals, then combined. Feed solutions were replenished as needed throughout the run to provide a theoretical polymer yield of 13 kg. The swollen, coagulated polymer was dissolved in ethanol to make roughly a 20 solution. The solids content and solution density were determined before proceeding to the hydrolysis and amination steps. In the hydrolysis step, 2500 ml polymer solution of known solids content and density was heated, with stirring, in a 4 liter kettle to 60 C. Enough 50 KOH solution was added slowly with a dropping funnel to theoretically hydrolyze all methyl acrylate to acrylic acid. After addition, the solution was heated to 80 C for 1 hour, then cooled with ice water. When the temperature of the polymer solution had dropped below 35 C, the solution was adjusted to pH 5 with concentrated nitric acid for the amination reaction. Enough propyleneimine to theoretically react with one equivalent of the pendant acid groups was added slowly with a dropping funnel over a 1 hour period, then heated to 60 C for 1 hour. The heating period, besides driving the reaction between the polymeric pendant acid groups and the propyleneimine, also acted to hydrolyze excess propyleneimine. The solution was allowed to cool overnight and then filtered to remove precipitated salts. The polymer was finally coagulated in acetone ethanol could also be used . By varying the composition of the feed monomer solution as to monomer ratio and type and by adjusting the feed rates of monomer to the reactor, it was possible to use the procedure of procedure 4 to prepare the polymers in Table 1. Ethyleneimine could be substituted equally for propyleneimine as desired. A 1000 ml resin kettle was equipped with a still head, air bubbler, and thermometer. The kettle was placed in a regulated water bath, set at 80 . 750 ml methyl methacrylate was added to the kettle followed by a solution containing 250 g morpholinoethanol, 5.0 g sodium methoxide and 0.5 g p methoxyphenol. During the 120 minute reaction time, air was bubbled slowly through the vigorously stirred solution. After 30 and 60 minutes, 5.0 g sodium methoxide was added. At the end of the reaction time, the mixture was cooled and neutralized with 17.0 g glacial acetic acid. The contents of the reactor were transferred to a 2 liter separatory funnel. The solution was extracted once with a liter of 9.5 sulfuric acid, then again with 0.5 liter of 3 sulfuric acid. The aqueous extracts were combined and extracted with petroleum ether to remove additional methyl methacrylate. The aqueous solution was made basic with 500 ml of 30 KOH and extracted twice with petroleum ether. The petroleum ether solutions, containing product, were dried over magnesium sulfate then stripped with a rotovac. The product was checked for purity by NMR. A 1 liter resin kettle was fitted with an air bubbler, temperature probe and still head. To the kettle was added, in order 233 grams piperidinoethanol, 5.0 grams sodium methoxide, 0.5 grams p methoxy phenol to inhibit polymerization , and 750 milliliters methyl methacrylate. With a slow stream of air bubbling through the reaction mixture, the mixture was stirred vigorously and heated to 80 degrees with a constant temperature water bath. 5.0 grams sodium methoxide were added 30 and 60 minutes after the start of the reaction. After 120 minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled and neutralized with 17.0 grams acetic acid. The reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel. The product was extracted from the reaction mixture into one liter of aqueous solution containing 95 grams concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture was treated with 500 milliliters of aqueous solution containing 15 grams concentrated sulfuric acid to extract remaining product. The two aqueous portions were combined and extracted with petroleum ether boiling point 30 60 degrees to remove residual methyl methacrylate, then rendered basic with 500 milliliters of aqueous solution containing 150 grams potassium hydroxide. The product was extracted from the aqueous solution with petroleum ether. The petroleum ether solution was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The petroleum ether was removed from the product with a rotary film evaporator under reduced pressure. A silver iodobromide wash off film control was prepared with A second wash off film was prepared as above except that 17 of the gelatin binder was replaced with a synthetic amphoteric polymer comprising AA DMAEMA MorphEMA APA 4 2 1 1 prepared as described in Procedure 4. The control and film of the invention were exposed through a resolution target. Incorporated developer was activated with a potassium hydroxide carbonate solution to initiate tanning development. Wash off images of the resolution target were produced by spraying with warm water. Higher resolution was observed for the present invention compared to the gelatin binder control. A microscopic examination of the sidewalls of the images revealed that the incorporation of the synthetic amphoteric polymer produced quite even and regular sidewalls compared to the ragged appearance of the control. A control wash off film was prepared with the following composition Wash off films of the invention were prepared in which 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 of the gelatin binder was replaced by the amphoteric polymer prepared as described in Procedure 4. Upon examination of samples after exposure, tanning development and warm water wash off, better line edge sharpness was observed in all cases for the amphoteric polymer containing films. Preferred performance was observed for the films in which 10 and 20 of the gelatin was replaced by the synthetic amphoteric polymer. A control film was prepared as in Example 2 except the carbon black was omitted. A wash off film of the invention was prepared which contained 30 of the gelatin replaced by amphoteric polymer. After wash off development, line edge sharpness was improved for the film prepared according to this invention in comparison to the gelatin binder control. This shows that the improved edge sharpness is not connected solely with carbon black being incorporated in one or more layers of the wash off film. Two layer silver iodobromide wash off films were made with the following compositions One film contained only gelatin as the binder in both layers control . A second film replaced 10 of the gelatin with AA DMAEMA MorphEMA APA polymer prepared as described in Procedure 4 in the bottom layer. A third film replaced 10 of the gelatin with the same polymer in the top layer, and a fourth film replaced 10 of the gelatin in both layers. Rating the film for edge sharpness after wash off, film four was best, film three next best and the film two was just slightly improved over the control. Improved edge sharpness was observed in wash off films containing from 5 to 30 of the gelatin binder replaced by one of the following synthetic amphoteric polymers A wash off drafting film was prepared as taught in U.S. Patent 3,353,958 and a wash off film of the invention was prepared in which 10 of the gelatin in the silver chloride emulsion was replaced with the amphoteric polymer described in Procedure 4. Improved image sharpness was observed by microscopic examination. A control wash off film was made with tabular silver bromide crystals of 0.16 cubic micron average volume, 0.13 micron average thickness and 9.7 average aspect ratio. The film composition was
