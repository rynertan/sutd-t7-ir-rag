# Data receiver including means for forming line samples and method of operating such a data receiver.

## Abstract
In a multipoint data communication system a master modem and a plurality of tributary modems are intercon nected via respective transmission channels. Adaptive equal izer circuitry 55,56 in the master modem equalizes the chan nel from a particular tributary by multiplying samples of sign als received from the tributary by an appropriate ensemble of tap coefficients stored in a memory 91 . Timing acquisition circuitry 29 adjusts the phase of the master s sampling cir cuitry 23,27 at the start of transmission from a given tribut ary so that the received signals are sampled at the correct time points. In order to do this, a timing acquisition signal having spectral components only within the non rolloff region of the equalized baseband equivalent transfer function is transmit ted by the tributary. The master samples and equalizes the received timing acquisition signal to form a succession of timing acquisition equalizer outputs.
