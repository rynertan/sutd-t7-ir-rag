# AN ANTIBIOTIC COMPOUND AND ITS PRODUCTION

## Abstract
A purified isolate of an actinomycete identified as ATCC 39366 is capable of producing the antimicrobial compound CL 1957B which also exhibits antitumor properties. The antimicrobial compound CL 1957B is produced by cultivating isolate ATCC 39366 under aerobic conditions in a culture medium containing assimilable sources of carbon and nitrogen until a substantial quantity of the CL 1957B compound is produced, and subsequently isolating the compound. The antibiotic compound CL 1957B, its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and pharmaceutical compositions compris ing this substance together with a pharmaceutically accept able carrier is also disclosed, as are methods of treating microbial infections and tumors in mammals, employing these pharmaceutical compositions.
