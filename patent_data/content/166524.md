# Six port reflectometer.

## Abstract
A six port reflectometer 10 has first and second direc tional couplers 11, 12 , a first waveguide 16 and a third directional coupler 13 providing a series connection from a source 14 to a test device 15 . The first coupler 11 is con nected to two detectors 17, 18 . The second coupler 12 is connected to a third detector 19 and to a fourth waveguide 21 having two ports connected via a waveguide 21 and a further port connected to an absorber 25 . The third coupler 13 is connected to a detector 27 and a reflector 26 . The second waveguide 12 and the reflector 26 receive radiation coupled by the second and third coupler 12, 13 respectively. The third and fourth couplers 13, 21 provide equivalent trans mission paths. Equal path lengths are traversed by signals leav ing the second coupler 12 and returning to it from the reflec tor 26 and the fourth coupler 21 respectively. With broad band couplers 11, 12, 13, 21 and waveguides 16, 24 , this arrangement gives broad band performance.
