# Electromagnetic stirring method and device for double casting type continuous casting apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and a device for electromagnetic stirring in a double casting type continuous steel casting apparatus using a pair of linear motor type electromagnetic stirring units 3 opposing each other, which are arranged in front and in rear of a plurality of cast steel pieces 1 in such a way as to straddle them. The magnetic poles of these stir ring units are caused either to move in the same direction in a reciprocal motion, for example, from the left to the right and vice versa, or to circulate in the same direction from one of the opposed units to the other.
