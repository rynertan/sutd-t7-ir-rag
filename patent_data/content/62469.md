# Method for producing fine grained, high strength aluminum alloy material.

## Abstract
An aluminum alloy material having a high strength, small grain size, good resistance to stress corrosion cracking and very high degree of workability is produced from an aluminum base alloy consisting essentially of 5.1 to 8.1 wt. Zn, 1.8 to 3.4 wt. Mg, 1.2 to 2.6 wt. Cu, up to 0.2 wt. Ti and at least one of 0.18 to 0.35 wt Cr and 0.05 to 0.25 wt. Zr, the balance be ing aluminum and impurities by an improved production meth od described in detail in the disclosure. The improved method is particularly characterized by special annealing step in a con tinuous annealing furnace under the application of a tension not exceeding 2 kg mmÂ² to a coiled alloy sheet to be annealed, the annealing including rapid heating the coiled alloy sheet to a temperature of 400 to 500 C at a heating rate exceeding 50 C min.
