# Vortex shedding flowmeter and method of measuring fluid flow.

## Abstract
A vortex shedding flowmeter comprising two stationary vortex shedding cross members 11,12 i.e., bluff bodies disposed transversely to a stream of fluid. Each cross member 11,12 has a bluff face 14,16 with sharp Karman vortex generating edges 15a, 15b 17a, 17b with indepen dently selected edge to edge widths d of from 10 to 40 of the sinside width of the conduit 10 through which the fluid flows and lengths L of from 0.3 to 2.0 d. The second cross member 12 is disposed downstream of the first cross member. Any sensor may be used in any location provided it or they sense the Karman vortices generated by co action of the two cross members 11, 12 . This flowmeter provides strong signals with a high signal to noise ratio and high Strouhal number.
