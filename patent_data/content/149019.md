# TRANSMISSION GEAR SHIFT AND CONTROL DEVICE, PARTICULARLY FOR INDUSTRIAL VEHICLES

## Abstract
A device 10 is described for the selection and control of the gears in a gearbox of a vehicle, of the type in which a lever 1 , actuable by the driver, acts, by means of a link 11 , on the gear selector forks. The link 11 is essentially constituted by a single fork actuating rod 3 such rod 3 is mounted rotatably and slidably in a longitudinal sense about its own axis of symmetry a and carries radially a coupling element 4 . This latter cooperates with an arm 17 of the lever 1 and from it is able to receive forces in two perpendicular directions which cause, in the said rod 1 , movements of translation or rotation about the said axis a .
