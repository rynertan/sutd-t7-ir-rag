# METHOD OF DETERMINING CURRENT POSITION OF A MACHINE.

## Abstract
A method of determining the current positional region of a machine comprises dividing the stroke of a movable part of a machine along one control axis into n equal regions each of a numerical value 1 assigning a current positional region number A to each of the regions incrementing or decrement ing the current positional region number A according to the direction of movement when a cumulative movement B of the movable part of the machine within each region exceeds the region distance value I or is smaller than zero, so that the current positional region of the movable part of the machine can be determined and delivering a current positional region signal, indicating the current positional region of the movable part of the machine, from the NC device to the machine.
