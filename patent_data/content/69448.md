CN IV or R7CH2.CN V is brominated to R6CHBr.CN or R7CHBr.CN VI , which is reacted with a compound R7H or R6 H respectively in the presence of a Lewis acid, to give a compound R6R7CH.CN VII . Compound VII may, if desired be hydrolysed to the corresponding amide R6R7CH.CONH2 VIII which may in turn be alkylated or arylated if desired to a substituted amide 67 89R R CH.C0NR R IX . Alternatively, substituted am ides IX may be obtained by reacting the corresponding acid, R6R7CH.COOH or a lower alkyl ester thereof, with the appropriate amine, NHR8R9.An amide VIII or substituted amide IX is then reacted with formaldehyde to give a hydroxymethyl compound, HOCH2 CR6R7 CO NR8R9 X , which is in turn halogenated, mesylated or tosylated to give the required starting material II. The starting material of the formula III used in process b is obtained in similar manner from a nitrile VII, by reaction with formaldehyde to give a hydroxymethyl compound, HOCH2. CR6R7 .CN, which is halogenated, mesylated or tosylated and then reacted with a compound XH to give the starting material III.

This antifungal activity against Candida albicans, a causative fungus of candidosis, andTrichophyton mentagrophytes, var. quinkeanum,a causative fungus of ringworm, was demonstrated as follows Female mice of around 30g. weight are injected sub cutaneously on a Friday with 0.5mg.of oestradiol benzoate. The following Monday day 0 they are clipped on the back and then dosed orally with test compounds. They are then inoculated with Candida albicans in the vagina and Trichophyton mentagrophytes var. quinkeanum on the back, and then given a second dose of the same compound. Dosing is repeated once daily on days 1 4. On day 7 skin lesions are scored visually and vaginal samples taken for culture on agar.Groups of 5 mice are used and compounds are dosed initially at a level of 250mg. kg. The dose is then reduced sequentially until a minimum effective dose MED is found. The MED for 2,2 bis 4 chloro phenyl 3 l,2,4 triazol 1 yl propionamide in this test was Smg. per kg.

Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler.Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powder, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetor alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol esters e.g. 2 ethoxyethanol and 2 butoxyethanol .

The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a microencapsulated form. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers e.g. nitrogen , potassium or phosphoruscontaining fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the compound, are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound.

The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparation for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants e.g. wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s . These agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butyl naphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohols, or with alkyl phenols such as octy1 or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , the concentrate to be diluted with water before use. The concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s .These concentrates suitably contain organic acids e.g. alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylenesulphonic acid or dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient s in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.01 to 10 by weight of active ingredient s may be used.

The technique employed was as follows The plants were grown in John Innes PottingCompost No. 1 or 2 in 4 cm diameter minipots. A layer of fine sand was placed at the bottom of the pots containing the dicotyledonous plants to facilitate uptake of test compound by the roots.The test compound was formulated either by bead milling with aqueous Dispersol T or as a solution of acetone or acetone ethanol which was diluted to the required concentration immediately before use.For the foliage diseases, suspensions 100 ppm active ingredient were sprayed on to the soil. Exceptions to this were the tests on Botrytis cinerea, Plasmopara viticola and Venturia inaequalls. The sprays were applied to maximum retention and the root drenches to a final concentration equivalent to approximately 40 ppm a.i. dry soil. Tween 20, to give a final concentration of 0.05 , was added when the sprays were applied to cereals. For most of the tests the compound was applied to the soil roots and the foliage by spraying one or two days before the plant was inoculated with the diseases. An exception was the test on Erysiphe graminis in which the plants were inoculated 24 hours before treatment. After inoculation, the plants were put into an appropriate environment to allow infection to take place and The disease control was recorded by the following grading 4 1 no disease 3 trace 5 of disease on untreated plants 2 6 25 of disease on untreated plants 1 26 59 of disease on untreated plants 0 60 100 of disease on untreated plants The results are shown in the followingTable.
