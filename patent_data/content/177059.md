# Modified polyisocyanates with biuret structure and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
Modified polyisocyanates with biuret structure contain ing terminal urethane groups and having general formula Process for the preparation of modified polyisocyanates having biuret structure containing terminal urethane groups having general formula I consisting in reacting an organic diisocyanate with water or with a compound splitting off water, in the presence of a compatibilizing agent having a hydrogen atom reactive towards the isocyanate group, as it can be determined by Zerewitinoff s method.
