# Diamond drill bit with varied cutting elements.

## Abstract
An earth boring bit utilizing thermally stable polycrys talline diamond material having a row of closely spaced sharp cutting elements 29 , followed by a row of widely spaced, blunt or rounded cutting elements 32 , each cutting element extending from a supporting matrix 19 a predeter mined amount to allow the sharp cutting elements 29 to form small relief kerfs in a geological formation, after which the blunt or rounded cutting elements 32 dislodge material between the kerfs. Additionally, cylindrical cutting ele ments 33 are positioned near the gage or outermost portion of the matrix to enhance gage bore cutting.
