An illumination system having a light source 12 disposed along a central axis of the system is provided with a conical reflector 20 coaxially disposed about the light source for forming an annular virtual image of an arc of the light source. A toroidal lens 22 is coaxially disposed about the central axis for forming a circular real image of the annular virtual image of the arc at the input port of a utilization device.
