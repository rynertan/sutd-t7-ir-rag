# Power supply arrangement for applying direct current to subscriber circuits.

## Abstract
A pulse supply for several subscriber lines to be supplied independently in a telephone system is disclosed. So as to limit the voltage ripple on the central power source due to the pulsating load the phases of the current pulse signals are shifted relative to each other.
