# Cyclic hexapeptide somatostatin analogs, process for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.

## Abstract
Somatostatin analogs are prepared wherein a cyclic hexa peptide contains a secondary amino acid which replaces sev en of the ring amino acids of somatostatin. The cyclic hexapep tides are easier to synthesize, have a longer duration of acti vity, and many have a greater level of activity than somatosta tin. The compounds have the properties of inhibiting the re lease of glucagon, growth hormone and insulin. Certain of the compounds also are capable of inhibiting the release of gastric acid secretions. The compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of acromegaly, diabetes, diabetic retinopathy and peptic ulcers. These cyclic hexapeptides are prepared by the solid phase method and or solution synthesis.
