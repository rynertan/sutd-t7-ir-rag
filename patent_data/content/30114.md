# Method for starting an operation of an internal combustion engine and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method of starting operation of an internal combus tion engine by utilizing a turning force transmitted from wheels 82 of a vehicle through a clutch 76 in addition to a driving force generated by a starting motor 75 . A computer 64 for controlling engine operations detects initiation of the engine starting operation on the basis of the rotating speed of the engine or intake air quantity and additionally detects the termination of the engine starting operation on the basis of the act that the engine rotating speed or intake air quantity exceeds an associated reference value. When the engine stops in the course of running of the vehicle, the engine can be re started under the influence of the inertial fource of the vehicle without resorting to the operation of the starting motor.
