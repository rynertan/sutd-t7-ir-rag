# Apparatus for projecting a light beam onto an optically readable record carrier.

## Abstract
An apparatus for playing optical discs is described, in which for a smoother locking in of the focus servo control the focusing error signal is initially derived from the amplitude of the h.f. signal, followed by a gradual change over to a difference signal derived by means of subdetectors. In this way the focus control point with the servo loop closed is shifted towards the desired in focus point.

## Claims
1. An apparatus for projecting a light beam onto an optically readable record carrier, which apparatus comprises an optical detector for detecting by means of at least two subdetectors the light beam which has been modulated by the record carrier, a focussing device for focusing the light beam on the record carrier, a circuit for generating a focusing error signal which comprises a first signal corresponding to the difference between the two signals supplied by the sub detectors, and a focusing correction device for adjusting the focusing device in response to the focusing error signal, characterized in that the circuit is adapted to initially generate as the focusing error signal a second signal corresponding to the sum of the signals supplied by the subdetectors minus a first threshold signal and subsequently to change over gradually from said second signal to the first signal.

## Description
The invention relates to an apparatus for projecting a light beam onto an optically readable record carrier, which apparatus comprises an optical detector for detecting by means of at least two subdetectors the light beam which has been modulated by the record carrier, a focussing device for focussing the light beam on the record carrier, a circuit for generating a focusing error signal which comprises a first signal corresponding to the difference between the two signals supplied by the sub detectors, and a focusing correction device for adjusting the focusing device in response to the focusing error signal. When such an apparatus is switched on it is com mon practice to disconnect the focusing error signal from the focusing device by means of a switch and to apply an increasing signal to the focusing correction device in order to move the focusing correction device towards the record carrier. In the meantime the focusing error signal is monitored to detect whether the desired control point is approached within specified range and subsequently apply the focusing error signal again, after which the control loop is closed and the focusing is controlled by means of the focusing error signal. In order to obtain a correct servo control the response of the focusing error signal near the in focus point should be high. However, this results in oscillations about the in focus point when the known lock in method is used. It is the object of the invention to provide an oscillation free lock in method and to this end the inven tion is characterized in that the circuit is adapted to initially generate as the focusing error signal a second signal corresponding to the sum of the signals supplied by the subdetectors minus a first threshold signal and subsequently to change over gradually from said second signal to the first signal. The invention is based on the recognition of the fact that in the apparatus in accordance with the present invention initially a lock in point with a low response is obtained and this lock in point is gradually shifted towards the desired in focus point with a high response, so that the desired in focus point is reached gradually in spite of the high response around this point. The invention may be characterized further in that the circuit is further adapted to generate prior to the generation of said signal sum minus said threshold signal a third signal, which third signal comprises said spiral sum and to cause said third signal to change over to the second signal prior to the change over from the second signal to the first signal. In this way it is achieved that the lock in point is shifted from the initial setting. A preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized further in that in comparison with said sum the third signal is incremented by a second threshold signal of the same polarity as the first threshold signal. This step ensures that prior to locking in the focusing device is actively controlled at the initial point. Embodiments of the invention will now be des cribed in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a known apparatus for reading an optical record carrier 1 insofar as it is relevant to the focusing. The record carrier 1 is rotated by means of a drive motor 2. An objective 4 projects the light from a laser 3 onto the record carrier 1. A semi transparent mir ror 5 projects the reflected light onto four diodes D₁, D₂, D₃ and D₄ in such a way that the diode signals S₁, S₂, S₃ and S₄ provide information on the location of the light spot formed by the beam relative to the track on the record carrier and information on the degree of focusing. The focusing information may be provided by the signal D Fig. 2 shows the signal D The known system has the disadvantage that in the range A F C a large steepness, and consequently a high gain, is required for an accurate control to the in focus point F B, which may lead to oscillations about point F B during locking in. In accordance with the invention this can be avoided by moving the objective 4 to the in focus point F B in a controlled manner by creating a lock in point F B, which is subsequently shifted gradually towards point B. This is achieved by taking the diode signal D Fig. 3 shows the diode sum signal D Subsequently, whilst the control loop is closed, the objective is moved towards point F B by causing the signal D By the use of the lock in method in accordance with the invention the device shown in Fig. 1 is modified to a device as shown in Fig. 5, in which the switch 8, the comparator 11 and the sawtooth generator 9 have been dispensed with and the circuit 6 which generates the signal D Fig. 6 shows an example of a circuit 60 for generating the control signal F When the switch 14 is closed the capacitor C is short circuited and the voltage V When the switch 14 is opened the voltage V It is to be noted that the system described here is a system comprising four subdetectors arranged in line. However, the invention also relates to other systems. For example, a known system is to arrange four detectors in the four quadrants of a rectangular array. The difference signal D
