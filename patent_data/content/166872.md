# Electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic copying apparatus comprising a hous ing 2 and a photosensitive member 12 disposed within the housing for free movement through an endless moving path. A paper jamming detector detects jamming of copying paper in its passage through the apparatus and produces a paper jamming signal. An emergency stopping means stops the copying process upon the occurrence of the paper jamming signal. A manually operable release switch 362 releases the stopping action of the emergency stopping means. A preparatory driving means 364 is included which, upon the releasing of the stopping action of the emergency stopping means by the operation of the release switch 362 , energizes by electric motor energizing circuit 366 a main electric motor drivingly connected to the photosensitive member 12 , thereby to move the photosensitive member 12 through at least one rotation in its endless moving path.
