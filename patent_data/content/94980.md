# Novel polymer composition including polyacrylonitrile polymers and process for preparing same.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for producing a novel polymer composition comprised of a polyacrylonitrile polymer and a block copolymer with acrylonitrile and non crystalline polymer sequences wherein the polymer composition is formed by the removal of a solvent from a solution of a polyacrylonitrile polymer and a block copolym er with acrylonitrile and non crystalline polymer sequences. There is also disclosed a process for preparing such novel polymer composition.
