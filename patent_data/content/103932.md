# Acoustic surface wave device.

## Abstract
In an acoustic surface wave device employing an input and an output transducer 2, 3 and a multistrip coupler 5 , the input and output tracks 11, 12 may have to be well separated to avoid unwanted acoustic energy transfer. As a result, a significant loss can occur from the launching of acoustic energy from the interconnecting conductors of the msc. In the improved device, the interconnecting conductors 22, 32 are given a spacing which is diffenent from the, or the equivalent, wide aperture beam spacing of conductors 16, 17 36 , 37 in either track of the msc, and which must not be such as to launch any acoustic surface or bulk waves within the frequency passband. In a forward transfer msc different spacings can alternate, and in a reflective msc the spacing can take the mean of the respective equivalent wide aperture beam spacings of the coupler electrodes. When a reflective msc is used there is a risk of acoustic reflection from one track to the other causing spurious response effects, especially when single guided mode transducers are employed. This is overcome by inclining the connecting strips 32 to the perpendicular to the propaga tion direction.
