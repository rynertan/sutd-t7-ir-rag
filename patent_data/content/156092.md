## Description
Process with relative machine for the automatic foldin in sequence of napkins, towels, pillow cases, tablecloths, and sheets after thev have been washed and ironed.This application for industrial patent relates to a process with relative machine for the automatic folding in sequence of napkins, towels, pillow cases, tablecloths and sheets after thev have been washed and ironed.The automatic machines currently in use are onlv able to fold one type or several similar tvpes of linen as, not onlv is there a great difference in size between one article of linen and another, but also, each article requires a particular fold.For the sake of illustration and clarification a towel, for example, is usual folded lengthwise in three more or less equal parts and crosswise in two exactl equal parts, whilst a napkin is usually folded in three parts both lengthwise and crosswise.As regards the folding processes commonlv used, thev are essentially based on the use of groups of conveyor belts along which are various stations where tknives or guillotines descend and press into the li nen, thus folding it.In the case of smaller sized linen, for example, pillow cases, napkins or hand towels, the folding processes conunonly used consist essentially of a table with moveable palettes or brackets along its edges, which are able, according to a preset sequence, to lift, turn over and fold articles of linen placed upon them. e ain of this invention is te invent a new aut itic folding process together with the relative machine able to be used for an , article of linen, whatever its measurements, and for anv desired tvpe of fold.A further aim of this invention is to invent a folding process which allows the machine to work at high speeds, thus giving a high hourly rate of production.All this has been made possible thanks to our invention which folds the article of linen twice in rapid succession and always at the same station, in contrast with traditional machines where for each fold a different station with knife or T 1jiiotinefl is necessary.Furthermore, this new folding process, according to the instant inven tion, means that it has been possible to realize a far less cumbersome machine, a machine which in am case is more compact than present day models.The fullv automatic folding of the aforementioned articles of linen ta kes place, according to this invention, at a station which essentially comprises a set of three straight rollers on a horizontal axis, adjacent to one another and positioned in such a wav as to have two rollers side by side and two placed one above the other.The ironed article of linen moves forward over the two adjacent rollers where a pressing mechanism is provided above and close to the two adjacent rollers in order to fold the article in the desired place.Said rollers grip and pull the fold which has been made downwards, thus folding the article for the first time.Another mechanism, situated immediately in front of the two rollers placed one above the other, and identical to the previous one, makes a second fold a wavs in the desired place. Said rollers grip and pull this second fold sideways, thus the article is folded a second time. It is then released onto a horizontal conveyor belt found immediatelv behind the two rollers placed one above the other Shollld for anv reason the second fold not be required the second itied anisn does not operate and the article of linen, on leaving the two adjacent rollers, autonatically passes between the rollers placed one above the other. Ahe accompanving drawings are for a clearer illustration of the machine which carries out the folding process according to the herein described invention, but thev exemplifv onlv one preferred embodiment in a schema tic form.Fig. 1 schematicall illustrates, in side view and in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the rollers, the members present in the station. Fig. 2 schematically illustrates, in side view, the supporto members of each roller found at the station, in accordance with the invention, as well as the drive svstem employed there.Figures 3 and 4 are e schematic illustration in prospective of the machine in accordance with the invention, which for obvious reasons of space has been divided and set out in two different tables.Figures 5 and 6 are a schematic top view of the machine, in accordance with the invention, which for obvious reasons of space have been divided and set out in two different tables.With reference to figure 1, the folding of the linen takes place at a station which comprises a main group of three staight rollers on a horizontal axis, equal in diameter and indicated bv the numbers 1 , 2 , and 3 . Said rollers are close together and arranged in such a wav that roller 1 and roller 2 are adjacent but slightly offset with respect to a horizontal plane, in that roller 2 in relation to the forward movement of the linen, comes after, and is slightly lower than roller 1 .On the other hand roller 2 and roller 3 are placed one above the other but slightly offset with respect to a vertical plane, in that rol ler 3 , which is below roller 2 , is laterallv offset towards roller 1 .Roller 1 lies immediately at the end of a conveyor N1 which moves forw ard horizontally and on which the ironed linen is placed for folding.Number 5 indicates the flat tooth of a fixed comb which holds the article of linen in place on its way from the end of the conveyor uni and the beginning of the roller 1 . Imiediately umstream from the roller 1 and immediately above the rol ler 2 begins a second conveyor N2 , which moves upwards.Under the roller 1 is an inclined plane S , the upper edge of which is close to the top and side of the roller 3 .The upper edge of this slide S is characterized b a plurality of U shaped notches, regularly spaced, into which fit the flat teeth of a rake R1 , which may be pushed forward bv a h draulic ram F fixed under the slide S .The station also comprises two thin tubular ducts on a horizontal axis, perforated along a generating line and from which, at the appropriate moment, jets of compressed air are released the first duct C1 is placed immediately above the beginning of the conveyor N2 , which is provided with its own driving mechanism M2 j the second tube C2 is placed inmlediatelr above the upper edge of the slide S , in front of the entfl point between roller 2 and roller 3 . With reference to figure 2 the drive motion present at the herein described station shall be examined.Number 7 indicates one of the two lateral support plates of the aforesaid rollers. PA indicates the driving pulley of the roller 4 which moves the convevor N1 , a pullev which is connected to the main motor by a toothed belt 1 . in dotted lines . P1 , P2 , pro and PO indicate the driving pulleys for rollers 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 .Pullev P4 drives, bv means of a toothed drive toelt T1 in continuous line roller 3 , roller 2 , and a roller 6 , on a horizontal axis, exactly above roller 1 . Said roller 1 is also driven bv the pulley 4 , independently of the others, by means of its own toothed drive belt T2 indicated by lines and dots .In the light of what has been described above and with reference to the illustrations, we shall now proceed to describe the operational phases in the folding process in accordance with the instant invention, presu ming that the linen is to be double folded and has already been placed on the conveyor uni . The main motor drives the pulley P4 and through the belts T1 and T2 respectively sets in motion the roller 1 and the rollers 2 , 3 and 6 all at the same times the conveyor N2 is, however, driven bv its own motor M2 .Along the convevor uni is provided a photoelectric cell E the signals from which activate an electronic memorv which controls each operational phase according to a preset programme for each article of linen as a manual push button selector has been provided for each article to be folded.Therefore, at preset intervals, depending on the type of linen preselected, the following operational phases occur presuming that a double fold is required a the article of linen moves along the conveyor not towards the rollers 6 and i which grip and push it over a flat toothed rake R2 which supports it, making a retractabele bridge between the beginning of the conveyor N2 and the point of exit from the aforesaid pair of rollers b the article of linen moves upwards along conveyor N2 a present interval from the floment when the photoelectric cell ntercepts, the motor fM2l of the conveyor N2 is stopped and simultaneously the rake R2 is moved backwards bv means of the hydraulic ram G and compressed air is released from the duct C1 into the area between rollers I and 2 d a first fold is made in the article of linen this fold tends automatically to push itself between the rollers I and 2 but it is also pushed bv the jets of compressed air.Said rollers grip and pull the article of linen downwards, e the fold is placed onto the teeth of the rake Rl which is in a forward position almost touching the roller 2 , the article then slides down the inclined plane S f the rake R1 after a preset time from when the photoelectric cell 1E intercepts, suddenlv moves backwards and at the same time compressed air is released from the duct C2 into the area between rollers 2 and 3 . g the second sold is made in the article of linen a fold which auto matically tends to push itself between rollers 2 and 3 but is also pushed by the iets of compressed air. These rollers grip and pull the article of linen sideways depositing it onto the horizontal conveyor N3 situated upstream from the aforesaid pair of rollers.Should the second fold not be required, the first fold on leaving the rollers l and 2 automatically passes between the rollers 2 and 3 as, in this case, the rake R1 is set back and therefore not able to pull the article of linen down between the rollers i and 2 .With regard to this it should be noted that the roller 3 is laterally offset with respect to the roller 2 found above it, precisel to al said roller , to independently catch hold of the article of li which hich is descending from the pair of rollers 1 and 2 whenever the rake razz R1 is set back.It should also be emphasized that the fold in the article of linen occllrs alltomatica11 as a part of the linen is on a fixed table whilst the other part continues to be moved foruard. The presence and the action of the jets of compressed air, therefore, are not really necessary but they are simplv extras to ensure a more reliable performance.Still referring to figure 2 , it should be noted that pulleys P2 and P6 are beld respectively on the ends of two support arms 9 which are both binged to plate 7 . Two threaded support rods 8a and 9a , which are cushioned, are provided in order to be able to regulate the distance between the centres of rollers 1 and 6 on the one side, and the pair of rollers 2 and 3 , on the other side, depending on the thickness of the article to be folded.Letter G indicates the jockey pulley supported bv a ball crank lever 10 which is hinged to the plate 7 and supported by a threaded rod 11 bearing a shock absorber spring l2 . With reference to figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 the fully automatic folding machine, in accordance with the herein described invention, comprises two stations as will now be described.The first one 101 is situated at the exit point of a wide conveyor N1 which moves forward horizontally and consists of numerous parallel bands of material placed close to one another. Immediately upstream from this station 101 a horizontal conveyor N3 is provided onto which the folded linen is deposited from the station 101 . Under the conveyor N3 another conveyor N 1 as wide as conveyor N1 is provided. Said conveyor N4 moves at right angles to convevors N1 and N3 and comprises a series of straight rollers supported by a mobile frame which means that these rollers may, at the appropriate moment, move up through the gaps existing between the bands of conveyor N3 , remove the article of linen and transport it in a direction perpendicular to that of the conveyor 3 . It is not considered necesan to go into the technical and structural details of the interaction of the conveyor N3 bands of material and the convevor N4 below it rollers since this procedure is commonlv used in order to briny about 900 changes in the direction of movement.The roller conveyor N4 deposits the article onto the conveyor consi sting of material belts 55 which, in turn, feeds a second station 102 where, obviously, the folds perpendicular to those already made, at the previous station 101 , are carried out.Upstream from the station 102 is a final conveyor N6 which moves hori ontallv, onto which is deposited the completely folded article of linen according to the ,r ograrme set by the electronic memoar belonging to the machine and preset bv the user with the push button selector for the article of linen to be folded.The machine, therefore, according to the instant invention allows for the following combination of folds to be had I a longitudinal fold and a transversal one, 2 a longitudinal fold and two transversal ones 3 two longitudinal folds and a transversal one 4 two longitudinal folds and two transversal ones.It should be noted that in the preferred embodiment of the machine ac cording to the herein described inventions illustrated in figures 3, 4, 5 and o, all the convevors N1 , N2 , N3 , N4 , s and not can have more than the two independently forward moving tracks shown in the example, which means that the number of compressed air ducts must be equal to the number of moving tracks and in the same way there must be a photoelectric cell for each track.This means that in the case of smaller sized linen for example, napkins or hand towels , it is possible to have several parallel folding lines, independent of one another, which gives a higher hourly rate of production. In this case when activated a corresponding nuniber of stop rods two in the example, indicated respectivelv with numbers 103 and 104 , descend onto the conveyor 534. Said rods act both as a guide and a barrier to the linen during their transfer from conveyor 63 to conveyor N4 and during the following phase of forward movement in the new directionIt should be clear that this specification refers to only one preferred embodiment of the machine according to the instant invention with the omission of the structural details regarding the pneumatic system, the electric system or the electronic memory in that these are common knowledge to experts in this field. Therefore, it is understood that the present invention is susceptible of numerous changes and modifications, above all concerning the struc ture, as knows to a person skilled in the art and still come within the scope of the invention herein described with reference to and as indicated by the accompanying drawings.
