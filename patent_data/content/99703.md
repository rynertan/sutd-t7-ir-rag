# AN ENVELOPE DETECTOR

## Abstract
In an envelope detector, signal divider means 9 divide an input signal into a pair of output signals of equal amplitude and equal phase. A reference oscillator 5, 6 provides a pair of reference signals of equal amplitude of phases differing by 90 . In modulating means 7, 7 each output signal is modulated by a respective reference signal to provide modulated signals which are filtered by respective low pass filters 11, 11 to provide base band signals. The base band signals are squared by squaring circuits 12, 12 and the resulting signals added by an adder circuit 13 . The square root of the sum may be provided by a square root circuit 14 . Alternatively, the base band signals are delivered to absoluting circuits 15, 15 to provide their absolute values which are added in an adder circuit 13 .
