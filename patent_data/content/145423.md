# Rotary drill bits and cutting elements for such bits.

## Abstract
A cutting element 20 for a rotary drill bit comprises a thin hard facing layer 21 , defining a front cutting face, bonded to a less hard backing layer 22 . The backing layer 22 is of non uniform thickness, for example is wedge shaped, and is thicker adjacent the cutting edge 25 of the facing layer than it is over the rest of the area of the facing layer. The rear surface 23 of the backing layer of the cutting element is bonded to a surface 26 on a carrier 27 which is mounted in the bit body 29 . The backing layer 22 of the cutting element may be formed in two portions a front portion which is bonded to the hard facing layer 21 and a second, wedge shaped portion which is bonded subse quently to the rear surface of the first portion.
