# An apparatus for slit radiography.

## Abstract
An apparatus for slit radiography comprising an X ray source 1 , an X ray detector 6 positioned behind a body L being irradiated, said detector collecting the radiation passed through the body, and a slit diaphragm 2 placed between the X ray source and the body being irradiated, through which diaphragm there is formed a planar X ray fan beam 4 , while for obtaining a complete X ray shadow image 9 of the desired part of the body at least the fan beam performs a scanning movement 3 . There are provided detection means 10 coacting with the X ray detector 6 and comprising a plurality of sections juxtaposed in the longitudinal direction of the strip like portion of the X ray detector irradiated through the slit diaphragm 2 , each section being adapted to produce an electric signal 11 depending upon the radiation impinging instantaneously on the associated section of the X ray detector. The slit diaphragm 2 , comprises a plurality of sections juxtaposed in the longitudinal direction of the slit, each coacting with at least one controllable attenuation element and corresponding with the number of sections of the detection means 10 , and is provided with control means 12 which during the scanning movement instantaneously and simultaneously adjust the quantity of X rays passed per section of the diaphragm, under the control of the electric signals generated by the detection means.
