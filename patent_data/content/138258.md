# Heat recoverable articles.

## Abstract
A marker sleeve assembly comprises a web of heat re coverable polymeric material bonded to itself or to at least one other polymeric web along a number of transverse seams 2, 6, 10a, 10b to define a plurality of open ended, radially inwardly heat recoverable marker sleeves 4, 7, 12 disposed in side by side relationship. The seams 2, 6, 10a, 10b provide lines of weakness to enable the marker sleeves 4, 7, 12 to be re moved. Also, the assembly includes a retaining spine that ex tends along an edge of the assembly and enables individual sleeves to be removed without disturbing the sequence of the remaining sleeves.
