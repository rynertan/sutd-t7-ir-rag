# Multiple computer system.

## Abstract
In a multiple computer system in which a plurality of computer stations are connected for mutual data transfer via a common data bus, at least one computer station is provided with a fail safe facility which prevents disrup tion of the entire system due to malfunction of the computer station. The comouter is preprogrammed to perform an input output circuit diagnosis routine after power up before control program execution which causes the input output circuit to output a coded pulse train signal. An abnormality detection circuit receives the coded pulse signal, converts it to a parallel bit word. and compares the derived word to a stored, predeter mined word. If the words match, the detection circuit causes a switching circuit to connect the computer to the common data bus otherwise, the computer remains disconnected from the rest of the multiple computer system.
