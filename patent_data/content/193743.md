# Magnetic refrigerant for magnetic refrigeration.

## Abstract
A magnetic refrigerant for magnetic refrigeration which comprises a sintered body containing at least one of rare earth elements selected from the group consisting of lantha num, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium and yttrium and a bal ance consisting essentially of at least one of aluminium, nickel and cobalt. This invention provides sintered magnetic bodies which are suited for use as magnetic refrigerants, and also provides significant contribution to the performance im provement of magnetic refrigerators and to the materi alization of regenerator type magnetic refrigerants.
