# Novel prostaglandin analogues and process for making same.

## Abstract
A novel process for the oxidation of olefins to the corresponding alpha epoxy alcohols which can be incorpo rated in the total synthesis of members of a novel class of prostaglandin analogues. Olefins are reacted with singlet oxygen in the presence of a group IVB, VB or VIB transition metal catalyst, excluding chromium. The reaction is fast and highly selective to the alpha epoxy alcohol. When cyclopentene is oxidized in the process of the invention, high yields of cis 2,3 epoxy cyclopentan 1 ol ar obtained. The latter compound is used as a starting material in the synthesis of prostaglandin ana logues. The prostanoids of the invention are characterized by an oxa group replacing the methylene group at the 7 position, and the absence of a hydroxyl or other substituent at the 11 position. Members of this class of prostanoids show important cytoprotective properties in animal tests.
