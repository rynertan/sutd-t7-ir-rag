## Description
Method for the manufacture of lens like articles The present invention realtes to a method for the manufacture of lens like articles and the like, and more particularly to a manufacturing method which permits fabrication of lens like articles or the like with various diameters ranging from a very small diameter to a large diameter and lens like articles and the like obtained by the manufacturing method. For the manufacture of lens like articles and the like, there has generally been employed such a method that after machining one side of a workpiece, it is reversed for machining the other side. With this method, however, it is difficult to obtain small diameter articles. As a solution to this problem, the applicant has proposed a method and apparatus for the manufacture of lens like articles and the like in his prior U.S. PatentApplication Serial No.170,450 filed July 2, 1980. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 is a front view of this previously proposed manufacturing apparatus, in which reference numeral 1 indicates a chassis 2 and 3 designate workpiece holders and 4 identifies a spindle. With this apparatus, a workpiece is machined in the following manner Prior to working, a grinding plate 43 and a polishing plate 44 are attached to the spindle 4, as shown in Figure 2, and a disc shaped workpiece 100 of a lensshaped article or the like is inserted into a chuck 25 of the holder 3 which is opened at a position spaced apart from the spindle 4.Moving a slide tube 23 in the direction B by activating a cylinder 35, the slide tube 23 is brought into engagement with respective chuck members 24 to resiliently deform them, thereby closing the chuck 25 to hold the outer periphery of the workpiece 100. Then, the spindle 4 is moved to bring the grinding plate 43 to the solid line position in Figure 2 and is then driven, and the work holder 3 is moved forward by a cylinder 32 or 34, while being driven, to press the work 100 against the grinding plate 43 as indicated by the chain line in Figure 2, by which one side of the workpiece is ground spherical. Then, the spindle 4 is retracted to bring the grinding plate 43 and the polishing plate 44 to the chain line positions inFigure 2, where the spherical surface of the workpiece 100 is subject to polish finish by the polishing plate 44.Next, the work holder 3 is moved back in the direction B and then stopped, and at the same time, the spindle 4 is also brought back to get out of the way of the work holder 3. After this, a machinable piece 101 of a material which has substantially the same machinability as the workpiece 100 is stuck, as by an adhesive binder, to the worked surface of the workpiece 100, as shown in Figure 3 a . It is desirable for the machinable surface of the machinable piece 101 to be of the same material as the workpiece 100.Then, the surface of the machinable piece 101 is ground spherical, as shown in Figure 3 b , and thereafter the work holder 3 is moved forward to position the worked surface of the machinable piece 101 adjacent to a suction pipe 5A of the work holder 2, as depicted in Figure 3 c .In this case, since the surface of the machinable piece 101 is ground spherical and since the center lines of the work holders 2 and 3 are in alignment with a common center axis line, the attraction of the worked surface of the machinable piece 101 to the suction pipe 5A is ensured.Next, the slide tube 23 is moved in the direction B to open the chuck members 23 and the work holder 3 is moved back, thus completing the transfer of the workpiece 100. In this case, the transfer of the work is carried out without changing the center axis for working. Next, the spindle 4 is moved forward to the solid line.position inFigure 2 and, at the same time, the suction pipe 5A is also moved forward, by a cylinder 15 or 17, in the direction A while being rotated, thereby working the other side of the workpiece 100 in the same manner as described previously. During an early stage of grinding, only the workpiece 100 is ground, but as the working proceeds, the machinable piece 101 is also ground , as shown in Figure 3 d . When the outer diameter of the workpiece 100 has reached a desired value d1, the grinding is stopped and the attraction by the suction pipe 5A is released and then the ground work 102 is disassembled from the machinable piece 101, finishing the grinding operation.In this way, a small diameter article is obtained by working a largediameter member which can easily be worked with high accuracy it is possible to easily fabricate high precision products of desired diameters. With such a prior method, after working one surface of a workpiece held by one work holder the workpiece is transferred, without changing the center of working , to another work holder for working the other surface of the workpiece, so that this method is effective for working both sides of a workpiece of a crystal material to obtain a crystal oscillator having directionality.Since this method involves the transfer of the workpiece, however, the apparatus embodying the method is complex in construction. In the case of producing a lens by working both sides of a workpiece of a glass material, directionality need not be taken into account during working, therefore, for such working, it is not necessary to employ such a complicated apparatus as shown in Figure 1. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a manufacturing method which permits working with simple structured apparatus. It is an object of the present invention to provide a manufacturing method which permits working of both sides of a workpiece without involving the transfer of the workpiece from one work holder to another on a common center axis line and which enables the fabrication of small diameter a rticles. According to the invention there is provided a method for the manufacture of a lens like article characterised by the steps of carrying out a first machining operation to machine one surface of a workpiece into a curved or spherical configuration attaching a machinable piece to the machined surface of the workpiece to form a composite article which facilitates handling and further machining of the workpiece carrying out a second machining operation to machine the other surface of the workpiece, including the machinable piece, into a curved or spherical configuration and disassembling the machined work from the machinable piece. The invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a front view showing a conventional manufacturing apparatus for working both sides of a workpiece Figure 2 is a schematic diagram showing how the workpiece is held during working in the apparatus ofFigure 1 Figures 3 a to 3 d are schematic diagrams showing the steps involved in the working of both sides of the workpiece in the prior art method Figure 4 is a front view illustrating apparatus for carrying out a method according to the present invention Figures 5 a to 5 c are schematic diagrams showing the steps involved in the working of both sides of a workpiece in the method according to the present invention Figure 6 is an enlarged diagram of one part ofFigure 5 c and Figures 7 a . to 7 c are schematic diagrams explanatory of how leads are attached to the work for testing its machining accuracy in the course of machining. The previously proposed method of manufacture of lens like articles has already been described with reference to Figures 1 to 3. A method according to the invention will now follow, with reference to Figures 4 to 7. Figure 4 is a front view of apparatus for carrying out the present invention, which is simple structured in that the work holder 2 and the associated parts in the apparatus of Figure 1 are removed i.e. a single holding device is provided to hold the workpiece during all of the machining operations. In Figure 4, reference numeral 201 indicates a chassis 202 designates a single work holder and 203 identifies a spindle. The working procedure of this apparatus is as follows A first machining operation is carried out in which one side of a workpiece 100 held by a chuck 204 of a work holder 202 is ground spherical by tools mounted on the spindle 203, such as a grinding plate and a polishing plate, in the same manner as in the prior proposal.Prior to the carrying out of a second machining operation on the other side of the workpiece 100, a machinable piece 101 is stuck, as by an adhesive binder , to the ground surface of the work 100 , as shown in Figure 5 a so as to form a composite article which facilitates handling and further machining of the workpiece. Then, the composite work assembly is removed from the chuck 204, reversed and mounted again on the work holder 202, with the machinable piece lOiheld by the chuck 204, as shown in Figure 5 b , for grinding the other side of the workpiece 100 into a spherical configuration. As the working proceeds, the machinable piece 101 is also ground, as shown in Figure 5 c .This is shown on an enlarged scale in Figure 6. When the outer diameter of the workpiece 100 has reached a desired value d2, the grinding is stopped and the work assembly is removed from the work holder 204 and then the ground work 102 is disassembled from the machinable piece 101, finishing the grinding operation. During the working, after grinding the other surface of the workpiece 100 is substantially completed, it may sometimes be necessary to measure the accuracy of the work for deciding whether further grinding is required or not. This is a problem which occurs especially when a high degree of accuracy is needed. For the measurement, leads must be attached to both surfaces of the work. In such a case, after grinding one surface of the workpiece 100, a lead 301 is attached to the ground surface and the machinable piece 101 is mounted on the ground surface with the lead 301 passing through a lead insertion hole 302 made beforehand in the machinable piece 101, as shown in Figure 7 a , and then after grinding the other surface of the work 100, a lead is attached to the ground surface prior to testing the work 100.It is also possible that after grinding one surface of the workpiece 100, the machinable piece 101 having made therein a lead insertion hole 303 is attached to the ground surface and that after grinding the other surface, leads 301 and 301 are attached to both surfaces as shownin Figure 7 b . In this instance, an adhesive binder for attaching the machinable piece 101 to the work 100 is a conductive one. Further, it is also possible that, after grinding one surface of the workpiece 100, a conductive machinable piece 101 is mounted on the ground surface by means of a conductive adhesive binder and that after grinding the other surface, leads are attached to the machinable piece 101 and the other surface as shown inFigure 7 c . As described above, according to the manufacturing method of the present invention, highly accurate working can be performed by a simple procedure without involving the transfer of a workpiece from one work holder to the other on the center axis line common to them which is required in the prior proposal, and in addition, the apparatus used is simple in construction. Though not described in detail, the work holding and releasing operations of the chuck 204 and the forward, backward rotational movements of the work holder 202 and the spindle 203 are the same as in the prior proposal. In Figure 4, reference numerals 205, 206 and 207 indicate cylinders 208 designates a slide tube and 209 identify chuck members. These elements have the same construction and operation as in the prior proposal. Further, in the case of planing the edge of the work after grinding both the surfaces thereof, a grinding tool 210 which is provided on the apparatus though not shown in detail is moved forward in the direction of the arrow as shown in Figure 6, performing the edge planing of the work. As has been described in the foregoing method according to the present invention, highly accurate lenslike articles can be obtained by a simple procedure without the necessity of transferring a workpiece from one work holder to the other on the common center axis line, and articles of various diameters ranging from a very small diameter to a very large diameter can be worked, and in addition, the apparatus therefor is simple in construction.Moreover, the foregoing description has been given of the case of working the surface of a work into a spherical configuration , but it is also possible to machine the work into other curved configurations e.g. a concave or aspherical lens like configuration such as a flat disc shaped one or the like.
