# Method and apparatus for measuring the rheological properties of an extrudable material.

## Abstract
The rheological properties of an extrudable material can be measured by extruding a strand of the material, measuring its diameter continuously, to give a series of diameter values, interpreting the variations in the strand diameter so as to characterize the surface of the strand, and deriving rheologi cal data from the surface characteristics of the strand. The variations in the strand diameter can be interpreted as to peak to peak amplitude, average diameter value, the fre quency of significant extreme values, standard deviations from a mean value, and the like. By means of these mathemat ical characterizations, the rheological behavior of the extrud able material can then be derived. The scorch behavior of a curable elastomer can be measured. The heterogeneity of a rubber compound can be described, or the macromolecular properties of a polymer can be measured such as gel , or degree of cross linking.
