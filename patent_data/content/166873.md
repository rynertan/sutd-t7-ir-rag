# Electrostatic copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A developing device for an electrostatic copying appar atus comprising a developer receptacle 94 , a developer applicator 96 for holding a part of a developer medium in the receptacle on its surface and applying toner particles to a latent electrostatic image to be developed, and a toner particle dispenser mechanism 100 . The toner particle dispenser mechanism 100 comprises a toner particle receptacle 124 having an open bottom end and a feed roller 126 disposed rotatably at the opening of the receptacle 124 and adapted to dispense toner particles 140 in the toner particle receptacle to the developer receptacle 94 . In order to prevent agglomeration of toner particles in the opening at the bottom of the toner particle receptacle 124 , a slide plate 146 capable of reciprocating movement in the widthwise direction along the inner surface of at least one side wall of the toner particle receptacle 124 is mounted over at least the lower portion of the inner surface of said side wall.
