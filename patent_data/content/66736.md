# JACKETED LAMP HAVING TRANSVERSE ARC TUBE

## Abstract
Transverse mounting of the arc tube within the lamp jacket is effected through a mount featuring a hinged self latching attachment of the arc tube to a support rod extending the length of the jacket and serving also as electrical connector to one electrode. A flexible connector makes connection to the other electrode. During manufac ture the hinges permit the arc tube to be folded in line with the support rod for passage through the neck and then to be transversely erected in the jacket, and the latch thereupon locks the arc tube in the transverse attitude.
