# Computer instruction prefetch circuit.

## Abstract
A digital computer system includes a computation unit 14 , a main store 12 , a virtual address translator 10 , a microinstruction control unit 170 and an instruction code prefetch circuit 212 . User instruction codes are stored sequentially in the main store 12 which is accessed for read and write operations by the virtual address translator 10 . The instruction code prefetch circuit 212 retrieves the user instruction codes from the main store 12 and holds the instruction codes in a register 16, 18 . The instruction codes are transferred from the register 16, 18 to the computation unit 14 in sequential order of use. The microinstruction con trol unit 170 produces selected microinstructions which are executed by the computation unit 14 to accomplish the operations specified by the user instructions. Designated mic roinstructions include commands which activate the instruc tion code prefetch circuit 212 to retrieve the succeeding user instruction codes from the main store 12 .
