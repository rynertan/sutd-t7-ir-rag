# High strength pigment binders for paper coatings containing carboxylated vinyl ester alkyl acrylate interpolymers.

## Abstract
High strength pigment binders for paper coating having increased water retention and stability are disclosed. The coating compositions comprise an aqueous synthetic poly mer latex and pigment and may contain other additives used in the art of pigmented paper coating. The latex comprises a dispersed interpolymer of a vinyl ester, a polyethylen ically unsaturated comonomer and a ethylenically un saturated mono or dicarboxylic acid and optionally an alkyl acrylate.
