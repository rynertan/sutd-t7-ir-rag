# Method of fabricating a self aligned metal semiconductor FET.

## Abstract
A method for the fabrication of self aligned MESFET structures 30 with a recessed refractory submicron gate. After channel formation 32 on a SI substrate 31 , which may consist of a III V compound semiconductor such as GaAs, with subsequent annealing the refractory gate 33G is deposited and patterned. This is followed by the overgrowth of a highly doped contact layer of e.g. GaAs using MOCVD or MBE processes resulting in poly cry stalline material over the gate mask and in mono cry stalline material 34S, 34D on exposed semiconductor surfaces. Next, the poly crystalline material is removed in a selective etch process, this step being followed by the deposition of source and drain electrodes 35S, 35D . In order to further improve process reliability, insulat ing sidewalls 43 43 can be provided at the vertical edges of the gate 33G to avoid source gate and drain gate shorts.

## Description
The invention concerns a method of fabricating a self aligned metal semiconductor field effect transistor MESFET , the transistor being formed on a semiconductor substrate and comprising a current channel and associated source, gate and drain electrodes. The process is particu larly suited for technologies using III V compound semi conductors such as GaAs. The FET has become an established element not only in microwave technology but also in switching and data processing system applications. Because of their superior device properties, GaAs structures have received increas ed attention and for high speed integrated circuit applications there is an increasing need for submicron FETs, i.e., transistors with gate lengths of below one micron. Many different FET structures have been proposed, most aimed at reducing the gate length and the parasitic resistances that substantially determine the maximum operational speed of the devices. Such processes have been described by N. Yokoyama et al. in IEEE Trans. Electron Devices, Ed 29, 1541 1982 . N. Yokoyama et al. in IEEE J. Solid State Circuits, Sc 18, 520 1983 . Y.Yamasaki et al. in IEEE Electron Devices ED 29, 1772 1982 . N. Kato et al. in IEEE Electron Devices ED 30, 663, 1983 . In essence, the proposed structures are of two types a Those having a refractory gate deposited as the first metallization that is then subjected to the post implant annealing step at 850 C or more, and b those using initially a dummy gate, consisting of oxide or photoresist, which is replaced by the final gate metallization in a final process step, and which there fore does not have to withstand the high anneal tempera tures. Technologically the first process a is simpler but the choices of gate metals is restricted. Process a furthermore provides for structures having self aligned contacts not requiring implantation with its associated problems, and permitting contact geometries that reduce charge injection into the substrate and capacitance coupling to the channel, i.e., the short channel effect. The process hereinafter described is directed to the fabrication of refractory gate FET devices with the associated advantages but since this novel process does not require an annealing heat treatment after gate deposition, the gate metal does not have to withstand the high annealing temperatures. The highest temperature to which the gate is subjected is that during a subsequent MOCVD or MBE process which is about 550 to 600 C. This permits the use of a wider range of gate materials. In the development of reliable and precise fabrica tion processes for high speed FETs specific techniques and device structures have been introduced, particularly the self aligned gate technology as well as recessed channel structures. These techniques are described in, e.g., R.S. Pengelly s book Microwave Field Effect Transistors Theory, Design and Applications Research Studies Press, 1982, Chapter 4, pp. 129ff. . The previously disclosed structures have a common drawback in that gate deposition occurs after recess etching, the latter being critical in that the threshold voltage of the device depends heavily on the depth of the recess and in that the etch process is difficult to control with sufficient precision. The herein proposed process provides for a structure offering the advantage that this sequence is, in essence, reversed in that the gate is deposited first whereas the recess structure is formed only afterwards in subsequent process steps. As a result, the new process permits full wafer cleaning and gate material deposition and avoids the need for critical precise recess etching steps. Basically, the inventive process proposed in the present specification takes advantage of the fact that the growth of at least some semiconductor materials such as GaAs and GaAlAs over metal or oxide masks becomes locally poly crystalline. The process also makes use of the fact that the etch rate of poly crystalline material is considerably higher than that of mono crystalline material, i.e., the poly crystalline regions, grown over metal or oxide masks, can be selectively removed in a simple wet etching step since the mono crystalline material grown on semiconductor surfaces will hardly be effected. The fact that overgrowth over oxide masks is poly crystalline and that the etch rates for poly and mono crystalline semiconductor materials are largely different are known and some limited applications that differ however substantially from the process of the present invention have been described in the following publica tions US Patent 4 426 767 Selective Epitaxial Etch Planar Processing For Gallium Arsenide Semiconductors notes, in the background section, the formation of poly crystalline material on masks as undesirable feature since it may interfere with further processing steps and hinder device performance.

Subsequent etching causes the dielectric mask to dissolve and the poly material to lift off. Article GaAlAs GaAs Integrated Optoelectronic Trans mitter Using Selective MOCVD Epitaxy And Planar Ion Implantation by M. E. Kim et al. GaAs IC Symposium 1983 IEEE, pp. 44 47 describes a process for fabricating optical device structures. It involves the use of dielec tric masks on which poly crystalline material is grown and subsequently removed by chemical etching. None of these references show or suggest the use of a FET metal gate as a mask on which poly crystalline material is grown when depositing a III V group compound layer whereby, in a subsequent process step, the poly crystalline can be selectively etched in the transistor gate region. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for fabricating a self aligned metal semicon ductor field effect transistor MESFET structure with a recessed refractory submicron gate involving less criti cal process steps than hitherto required. Another object is to devise a MESFET fabrication process that provides for very effective self alignment between the gate contact and the highly doped source and drain contact regions and for a channel recess structure not requiring precise recess etching steps. The invention as claimed is intended to remedy the drawbacks encountered with hitherto known FET fabrication processes. The main advantages offered by the invention are the simplicity and reliability of the process since a number of critical process steps can be avoided. Also, because the process provides for self alignment of the most critical structural features the process permits gate length of well below 1 µ and provides for very low source gate resistances thus permitting the fabrication of high speed integrated circuit technology FETs. Parti cularly when using insulating sidewalls on the vertical edges of the gate electrode to avoid source gate and drain gate shorts process reliability and reproducibility are further advanced. Various ways of carrying out the invention are described in detail below with reference to drawings in which Referring now to the drawings and first to Fig. 1 thereof, there is shown a first embodiment of a MESFET produced in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The MESFET 10 is formed on a semi insulating SI GaAs substrate 11. The self aligned device 10 comprises a relatively shallow n type channel 12 with a thickness of approximately 50 nm and a dopant concentra tion in the order of 4 10¹⁷ atoms cm³. Arranged on the channel 12 is a submicron metal gate 13G consisting of a refractory material such as W₃Si. Positioned on either side of the gate electrode 13G but separated therefrom are heavily n doped GaAs contact layers 14S and 14D forming source and drain regions, respectively. Regions 14S and 14D are deposited on the surface of the SI substrate 11 partly overlapping the channel region 12 as illustrated in the drawing. Their dopant concentration is about 1 10¹⁸ atoms cm³ but can be higher. Device 10 further includes ohmic source and drain electrodes 15S and 15D, respectively, connecting to the underlying heavily doped GaAs contact layers 14S and 14D. In Figs. 2A 2H the successive steps of the process to fabricate the MESFET of Fig. 1 in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in detail. These successive steps are listed in Table I indicating the correspondence between the steps and the drawings. While the following description is primarely direct ed to the fabrication of the MESFET shown in Fig. 1, this description is exemplary of the fabrication of a class of devices which embody the principles of the present inven tion. It should be noted that the thickness and other dimensions, materials used as well as process parameters shown herein are selected for clarity of illustration and not to be interpreted in a limiting sense. Most individu al process steps used to evaporate, to etch, to clean, to pattern are well known and can be performed by employing conventional equipment and techniques. They are, there fore not explained in greater detail below. Referring now to Fig. 2A, the fabrication process is initiated starting from a semi insulating undoped or chromium doped GaAs substrate 11 in which the FET channel of n type conductivity is formed Step 1 . This step consists of exposing openings in an applied photoresist layer in the area of the substrate where the channel is to be formed and implanting n type ions such as silicon directly into the exposed substrate. The energy and dose of ions implanted are chosen such that the semiconducting n GaAs layer 12 resulting therefrom is shallow, having a depth of approximately 50 nm and a dopant concentration of a about 4 10¹⁷ atoms cm³. Typically, the dose used is 2 10¹² atoms cm² at 50 keV. The ion implant step is followed by an annealing heat treatment Step 2 at about 850 C serving to acti vate the channel implant. In order to prevent the As from escaping this is done in a protective gas atmosphere or after covering the wafer surface with a protective cap such as a Si₃N₄ layer. The n channel 12 may also be formed by other techni ques. If an epitaxy process is used, this can consist of growing an initial epitaxial layer of about 30 nm thick ness and a dopant concentration of about 4 10¹⁷ atoms cm³ onto the substrate surface, this being followed by lithographic processes resulting in a mesa forming a n channel of about the same properties as the channel 12 otherwise obtained by ion implantation. Next, referring to Fig. 2B, layer 13 of a heat resistive refractory metal such as tungsten silicide W₃Si of about 0.25 µm thickness is deposited Step 3 on the wafer surface using any suitable conventional method. Subsequently, as illustrated in Fig. 2C, the MESFET gate 13G is patterned Step 4 using lithographic techniques to cover the gate region with an etch resist ant mask and to subsequently etch the exposed region of layer 13. An anisotropic etch process such as RIE in CF₄ O₂ can advantageously be used for this purpose. In the succeeding step 5 of the process, which is illustrated in Fig. 2D, a highly doped n GaAs contact layer 14 covering the whole structure is grown using MOCVD or MBE processes. Process conditions are chosen that regions 14S and 14D of this layer, i.e. those that are grown on semiconductor surfaces substrate 11 and the channel 12 are mono crystalline whereas region 14P over lying the metal gate 13G is poly crystalline. Layer 14 has a thickness of approximately 400 nm, the dopant con centration is atypically in the order of 1 10¹⁸ atoms cm³. In the following step 6, the result of which being shown in Fig. 2E, the poly crystalline material of region 14P is removed employing any selective wet etch process, e.g. using HCl. The mono crystalline regions 14S and 14D remain virtually uneffected by this etch process since the etch rate of poly GaAs is substantially higher than that of mono crystalline material. The next three figures, Figs. 2F through 2H, illus trate the deposition of the source and gate electrodes 15S and 15D. First Step 7 , a lift off mask 22 is deposited Fig. 2F . Thereafter Step 8 , a layer of metal providing for good electrical contact with the underlying contact layers 14S, 14D is applied, this metal layer comprising regions 15S and 15D over contact layers 14S and 14D, respectively and of region 15G deposited on mask 22 located on top of the gate 13G. In a subsequent conventional lift off step 9 mask 22 and section 15G of the metal layer are removed leaving source and drain electrodes 15S and 15D, respectively. The contact layer may consist of Au Ge Ni Au with a thickness of approxi mately 100 nm. In a final step 10 the contacts are alloyed for 30 seconds at a temperature of 450 C. The resulting structure which is shown in Fig. 2H corresponds to that of Fig. 1. In integrated circuits a large number of individual MESFET devices are formed on a wafer that need to be separated from each other. For such applications addition al process steps are required to provide for device separation. An example is the n GaAs layer 14 that, after the above described process step 5 illustrated in Fig. 2D covers the whole wafer structure thereby provid ing for intolerable inter device connections. This can be avoided by subsequently applying masks covering the n GaAs regions 14S, 14P and 14D of the MESFET devices and by then etching the uncovered n GaAs thereby providing for device isolation. A second embodiment of a MESFET produced in accord ance with the principles of the present invention is shown in Fig. 3. The MESFET 30 is formed on a semi insu lating GaAs substrate 31. The self aligned device 30 comprises a n type channel 32 with dimensions and pro perties similar to those of layer 12 of the MESFET in accordance with Fig. 1. Arranged on the channel 32 is a refractory gate 33G, its vertical edges being covered with sidewall spacers 43 43 in order to prevent any shorts between the gate 33G and the adjacent heavily n doped GaAs contact layers 34S and 34D that form source and drain regions, respectively. The latter regions are deposited on the surface of the SI substrate 31 partly overlapping the channel region 32 as illustrated in the drawing. Their dopant concentration is at least 1 10¹⁸ atoms cm³. Device 30 further includes ohmic source and drain electrodes 35S and 35D, respectively, connecting to the contact layers 34S and 34D but separated from the substrate 31 by dielectric layers 41S and 41D. In Figs. 4A 4H the successive steps of the process to fabricate the MESFET of Fig. 3 in accordance with the present invention are described in detail. These success ive steps are listed in Table II indicating the corres pondence between the steps and the drawings. Since a number of process steps listed in Table II parallel the steps listed in Table I, the following detailed descrip tion will be limited to those steps which are significant ly different from those already discussed above. The fabrication process of the MESFET shown in Fig. 3 starts, as illustrated in Fig. 4A, with the definition and implant of the n channel 32 in the SI GaAs substrate 31 Step 1 followed by an annealing process to activate the implant Step 2 . As shown in Figs. 4B and 4C, this is followed by the deposition of an refractory gate layer 33 Step 3 with subsequent patterning of the gate electrode 33G Step 4 . These process steps are accomplished along the lines of the corresponding steps of Table I which were described previously in connection with Figs. 2A, 2B and 2C. The next process step, illustrated in Fig. 4D, is the deposition of a dielectric layer 41 consisting of e.g. Si₃N₄ in a Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition PCVD process Step 5 . The thickness of the layer is in the range from 50 to 100 nm. Fig. 4E shows the next step in which, using conventional lithographic techniques, an etch mask comprising regions 42S and 42D is applied Step 6 in preparation for the subsequent anisotropic RIE etching step by which the exposed Si₃N₄ of layer 41 is removed Step 7 . After the removal of the mask portions 42S and 42D the structure shown in Fig. 4F is obtained. Si₃N₄ is still present in regions 41S and 41S where it serves as a mask for contact regions to be formed in a later process step and, in addition, due to the aniso tropic etching, at the vertical edges of the gate elec trode 33G where it forms insulating sidewalls 43 43. Fig. 4G illustrates step 8, i.e., the overgrowth of an highly doped n GaAs contact layer in a process very similar to that described in connection with Fig. 2D and the fabrication of the MESFET in accordance with Fig. 1. However, due to the presence of dielectric layers 41S and 41D not only the n GaAs material grown over the metal gate 33G is poly crystalline but also the material grown over the dielectric layers 41S and 41D at both sides of the gate, i.e., all three regions 44P are poly crystal line. Regions 44S and 44D, on the other hand, are grown on semiconductor material and are mono crystalline. In the succeeding step 9, the result being shown in Fig. 4H, the poly crystalline material of regions 44P is removed in very much the same way as in the step illus trated in Fig. 2E, i.e., the mono crystalline regions 44S and 44D remain virtually uneffected by the etch process since the etch rate of poly GaAs is substantially higher than that of mono crystalline material. It is, however, to be noted that the contact layer sections 44S and 44D are clearly separated from the gate electrode 33G by sidewall spacers 43 43. They are, furthermore, limited in their outword extension by the dielectric layers 41S and 41D thereby providing for device separation on the SI substrate that forms the integrated circuit wafer on which a large number of devices can be formed. Not shown in Figs. 4 are steps 10, 11 and 12 re quired to deposit and define the source and gate elec trodes 35S and 35D, the process being virtually identical to that described with the aid of Figs. 2F 2H for the MESFET structure of Fig. 1. It should however be noted that the electrode layer regions 35S and 35D are not entirely deposited on the n GaAs layer as regions 14S and 14D in Fig. 2G are but that they are partly covering the dielectric layers 41S and 41D as illustrated in Fig. 3. This figure showing the resulting MESFET structure. Further alternative processes that are based on the concepts described above have been designed, one example being a process for fabricating a MESFET structure similar to that shown in Fig. 1 or 3 but in which the heavily doped n semiconductor contact layers 14S and 14D, grown on the structure after gate deposition, consist of a semiconductor different from that of the substrate 11 and in which hot electrons injected from the contact layer 14S into the channel 12 are advantageously used to improve device characteristics. For such a MESFET structure, having an epitaxially grown mesa type n channel 12 the substrate 11 can consist of SI GaAs whereas GaAlAs is used for the n contact layers 12S, 12D, e.g., Ga For specific applications and structures it may also be desirable to use, for both, the substrate and for the n contact layer, materials other than those employed in the above described examples. Instead of using GaAs, the basic system material used could be e.g. InP or Si. In addition, it can be advantageous to use tapered contact layers by e.g. starting with n InGaAs at a GaAs substrate surface and changing to n InAs towards the top of the contact layer to improve the growth on the sub strate and, on the other hand, to provide for good contacts with the subsequently deposited electrode material. From the above it will be evident that many other alternatives, modifications and variations still falling within the scope and spirit of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In summary, the inventive process makes use of the fact that growth of GaAs, or GaAlAs or other suitable semiconductors, over metal or oxide masks becomes locally poly crystalline thereby permitting selective etching of masked regions because the etch rate of poly GaAs is substantially lower than that of mono crystalline material. This permits a very simple process suitable for integrated circuit technology fabrication of submicron recessed gate MESFET structures in that gate deposition is done prior to forming the recess structure. Deep channel recesses can be obtained without a need for critical precise recess etching processes and without degrading gate length resolution and gate quality. Also, due to the reversed process, full wafer processes for gate deposition and cleaning is possible. The use of insulating sidewalls on the edges of the refractory metal gate avoids potential problems with gate source or gate drain shorts that may occur due to imperfect removal of the poly crystalline n GaAs above the gate mask . This leads to further improved reliabi lity of the process and thus to higher yield. The MESFET structure obtained by the described fabrication process has the advantage of having a very low source resistance because the source drain contact plane can be raised considerably over the n channel plane resulting in good current spreading and also in low substrate current injection. The low series resistance makes the device particularly suitable for high speed logic applications.
