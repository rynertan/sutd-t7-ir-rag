# A surface cleaning machine.

## Abstract
A surface cleaning machine of the kind in which abrasive grit 6 is projected at high velocity by a blast wheel 3 against a surface 1 to be cleaned. The machine has a hopper 11 to receive grit 6 carried by rebound and air flow from the zone 4 being cleaned. The angle of the blast wheel 3 can be varied, to vary the angle of impact of the projected grit 6 on the surface 1 in the cleaning zone 4 . The blast wheel 3 and driving motor 3B are carried by a housing 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D which is mounted in the machine by a hinge 17 . The rear wall 8C of the reclaim channel 6 is movable with respect to the front wall 8A .
