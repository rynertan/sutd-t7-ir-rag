# Ultraviolet light resistant composition of transparent and translucent vinyl polymers.

## Abstract
The invention relates to obtaining weatherability or U.V. light stability in vinyl polymeric translucent and transparent materials, which are designed for use in corrugated roofing, films for greenhouses, and the like. It has been found that by making a composite vinyl polymeric material where the main material or substrate is a transparent or translucent vinyl polymer and capping or coating it with a very thin film of a plasticized vinyl polymer containing a high level of a clear U.V. light absorber or stabilizer, such as, for example 1 cyano 2,2 diphenyl ethylacrylate, excellent weatherability is obtained. The important feature is the concentration of the clear U.V. stabilizer at the surface of the composite material which also results in the use of less U.V. stabilizer.
