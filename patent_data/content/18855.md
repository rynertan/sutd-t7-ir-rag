# Variable pressure and displacement reciprocating pump.

## Abstract
A recriprocating pump in which a plunger 10 is reciprocated by means of a crankshaft 2 a connecting rod 3 and a crosshead 4 includes cushioning means 9 disposed between the crosshead 4 and the plunger 10 . The cushioning means 9 is adapted to allow adjustment of its cushioning force and is capable of absorbing the plunger stroke whereby the delivery pressure is readily adjustable by adjustment of the cushioning force and the delivery volume or rate is also readily adjustable by absorption of the plunger stroke by the cushioning means 9 . In one embodiment the cushioning means 9 comprises a fluid pressure cylinder 11 connected to an adjustable fluid pressure generator 14 and an accumulator 15 .
