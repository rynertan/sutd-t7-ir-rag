# Extruder barrel construction.

## Abstract
An extruder 2 comprising an extruder barrel compris ing a plurality of barrel modules 4 , each provided with an inner lining material 16 , and at least one plate 6 is described and claimed. Such an arrangement facilitates assembly and dismantling of the barrel for replacement of inner parts. In a preferred embodiment, a plate 6 having an opening 26 passing therethrough and comprising projec tions 30 extending into said opening, is interposed between each two adjacent barrel modules 4 , the openings of the plates 6 and internal surfaces of the barrel modules forming a substantially continuous passageway which provides an extrusion chamber 3 . The plates 6 are provided with a pluralty of bore holes around the circumference thereof arranged to correspond with bore holes located in external flanges 12 extending around end portions of the barrel modules, so that said plates and barrel modules may be sealingly secured together by the insertion of fastening means 28 into aligned bore holes of the plates and barrel modules.
