# A hand held machine tool.

## Abstract
A hand held machine tool intended for grinding and like operations, having an outer housing 10 lodging a pneumatic vane motor 11 by which a tool carrying spindle is rotated. At its forward end, the motor is supported in the housing by a resilient O ring 29 for absorbing radial vibrations arising in the spindle during work and a conical thrust ball bearing 30 for transferring axial load to the housing without restraining the radial resiliency provided by the O ring. At its rear end, the motor is supported in the housing by a substantially non resilient O ring 38 , which means that the motor is apt to perform a pendular movement about its rear end when exposed to vibrations from the spindle.
