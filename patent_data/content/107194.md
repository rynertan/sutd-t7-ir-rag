# Hydraulic control system for continuously variable V belt transmission.

## Abstract
A hydraulic control system comprises a line pressure re gulator valve 1102 which uses a spring 1152 1154 with a non uniform spring rate. A spring 1152 1154 is compressed between a pressure regulating element 1148 and a member movable 1150 responsive to a reduction ratio between drive and driven pulleys. A length of the spring 1152 1154 is varied by the member 1150 with variation in the reduction ratio. The line pressure regulator valve 1102 generates a line pressure having non linear characteristic with respect to the variation in the reduction ratio.
