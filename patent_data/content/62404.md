# Friction open end spinning apparatus.

## Abstract
A friction spinning apparatus comprises two rollers 1, 2 in closely spaced parallel arrangement which define between them a yarn formation zone at an elon gate gap along the rollers and a feed duct 41 which extends into the gap so as to feed fibres directly into the gap in such a manner that they can fall directly onto the yarn. The feed duct 41 is biassed slightly toward the roller 1 which turns into the gap so as to increase the proportion of fibres joining the yarn 419 at the junction with that roller.
