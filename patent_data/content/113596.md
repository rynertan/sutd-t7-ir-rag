## Description
Traffic Signalling System This invention relates to apparatus for use as a traffic signalling system.Hitherto, the warning devices used as a signalling system at road work and other road hazards were in the form of coloured plastic cones. These were placed on the road surfaces to separate lanes of traffic, or mark the edges of roadworks. These cones, however, have several disadvantages. For safety reasons it is necessary that the cones are light enough to be easily knocked over and also that they are easily deformable on impact. However, when a cone is knocked over its shape is such that it can be easily moved by the wind. Thus, it may be moved away from its proper position and is liable to be run over by a passing vehicle.Moreover, its shape and one piece construction mean that it can be so seriously damaged as to be subsequently unusable after being run over.It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate these disadvantages. According to one aspect of the traffic signalling system of the present invention there is provided apparatus for use as a traffic warning device comprising a central tube, an upper hinge block, a lower hinge block, a number of support legs, said legs being pivotally attached to said upper hinge block and a number of link arms, said link arms being pivotally attached at one end to the lower hinge block and at the other end each to a respective leg.Preferably, said top hinge block is slidably mounted on the central tube in such a way that the legs may be folded in flat against the tube to allow easy storage and transportation.Preferably also, a number of support brackets and the like are provided, said support brackets allowing barriers, signs and the like to be attached to the warning device.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a side view of one embodiment of a traffic warning device in accordance with the present invention Fig. 2 is a side view ofthe traffic warning device of Fig. 1 showing the legs in their folded closed position Fig. 3 is a side view of the upper hinge block of the device of Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is a bottom plan view of the hinge block of Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a bottom view of the lower hinge block of the device of Fig. 1 Fig. 6 is a side view of the hinge block of Fig. 5 Fig. 7 is a front view of one of the legs of the device of Fig. 1 Fig. 8 is a side view of the leg of Fig. 7 Fig. 9 is a plan view of one of the link arms of the device of Fig. 1 Fig. 10 is a side view of the link arm ofFig. 9.Fig. 11 is a perspective view of a traffic warning device similar to that of Fig. 1 Figs. 12a and 12b are top and side views respectively of one embodiment of a clip for use as an alternative means of fixing the legs of the device of Fig. 1 to the hinge blocks Figs. 13a and 13b are top and side views respectively of an alternative clip to that of Fig. 12 Figs. 14a and 14b are top and side views respectively of a single lug tube coupling for use with the device of Fig. 1 Figs. 15a and 15b are top and side views respectively of a four lug tube coupling for use with the device of Fig. 1 Figs. 16a and 16b are side and top views respectively of a straight coupling for use with the device of Fig. 1 Figs. 17a and 17b are front and side views respectively of an end portion of the central tube of the device of Fig. 1 showing a catch which in use engages a slot in the coupling of Fig. 16 Figs. 18a, 18b and 18c are top, side and bottom views respectively of an end tube coupling for use with the device of Fig. 1 or with the tensioner of Fig. 23 Fig. 19 is a side view of a bolt for use in the tensioner assembly of Fig. 23 Figs. 20a and 20b are side and front views respectively of a nut for use with the bolt of Fig. 19 in the tensioner assembly of Fig. 23 Fig. 21 is a front view of a tensioner spring for use in the tensioner assembly of Fig. 23 Figs. 22a, 22b and 22c are top, side and bottom views respectively of an end coupling for use with the tensioner assembly of Fig 23 Fig. 23 is a side view of a tensioner assembly for use with the barrier clamp of Fig. 30 Figs. 24a and 24b are front and side views respectively of a warning light for use with the warning device of Fig. 1 Figs. 25a and 25b are part cut away side and top views respectively of a sign support bracket for use with warning device of Fig. 1 Fig. 25c is an end view of the sign support bracket of Figs. 25a and 25b Figs. 26a and 26b are side and front views respectively of a ground pin for use in stabilising the legs of the warning device of Fig. 1 on the ground plate ofFigs. 27a, 27b and 27c Figs. 27a, 27b and 27c are side, top and end views respectively of a ground plate for use with the warning device ofFig. 1 Fig. 28 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of a barrier clamp Fig. 29 is a perspective view showing two of the clamps of Fig. 28 fixed to a barrier Fig. 30 is a side view of a second embodiment of a barrier clamp with a tensioner assembly fitted Fig. 31 is a front view of the tensioner assembly of Fig. 30 and Fig. 32 is a perspective view of the warning device of Fig. 1 showing examples of the tube couplings of Figs. 14 and 15 in use.Referring to the drawings, a traffic warning device comprises a central plastics tube 1 having slidably mounted on it an upper hinge block 2 and mounted at its base a lower.hinge block 3. Four C section plastic legs 4 and four C section link arms 5 each have one of their ends pivotally mounted by way of pivot shafts 6 pivoting in mounting holes 7 in the hinge blocks 2, 3. The other end of each of the link arms 5 is pivotally mounted by way of pivot shafts 6 each to a respective leg 4. The legs 4 and links 5 have slots 8 at their ends to allow them to bend easily for attachment of the pivot shafts 6 to the mounting holes 7 in the hinge blocks 2, 3. Further, slots 9 in the legs 4 serve to reduce to the wind resistance of the legs hence reduce the incidence of the device being blown over by the wind.In use, the device is removed from storage with the legs in the folded position as shown in Fig. 2. The legs 4 are then moved into the position shown in Fig. 1 by sliding the upper hinge block 2 down the central tube 1 causing the lower end of the legs 4 to move out from the base of the device as the link arms 5 pivot on the lower hinge block 3. When the arms are in their fully open position the upper hinge pivot 2 is prevented from sliding up the central tube 1, and hence refolding the legs 4, by a catch 10.As an alternative to joining the parts with the pivot shafts 6 and mounting holes 7 the shafts 6 can be replaced with extra mounting holes and the parts joined with clips such as those shown in Figs. 12 and 13.For particular applications it is possible to manufacture a device having a number of legs other than four. In particular a device with three legs requries triangular hinge blocks, etc.Various accessories can be used with the warning device and it can be used as a base for signs and barriers. It is possible to make a fence or barrier by joining up a number of devices with battens mounted on the top part of the tube. Similarly, road signs and warning lamps may be easily attached and the slots in the legs make it easy to run lengths of reflective tape between a number of warning devices. The warning devices may be manufactured in a number of different colours for use in different situations.The shape of the device is such that it may be mechanically laid. Should a device be run over by a vehicle its construction is such that in most cases it will be possible to repair it by simply replacing those parts which have been damaged.Examples of the various accessories will now be described with reference to Figs. 14 to 32 of the accompanying drawings.Figs. 14a and 14b show a single lug tube coupling. This can be used as the end for a flat barrier, as shown in Fig. 32, or as the end for a round barrier when used in combination with the end tube coupling of Fig. 18. It can also be used to fix signs onto tubes or onto the warning device of Fig.1.Figs. 15a and 15b show a four lug tube coupling. This can be used for sign fixing or for sign frame stabilising. It can also be used to extend barriers in all directions from the device bf Fig. 1 as shown in Fig. 32.Figs. 16a and 16b show a straight coupling for use in extending tubes or for fixing high signs onto the device ofFig. 1. The tubes may be provided with a catch 11, as shown in Fig. 17, which co operates with a slot 12 on the straight coupling. Alternatively the coupling may be fixed to the tubes with the clips shown in Figs. 12 and 13.Fig. 18 shows an end tube coupling. This can be used in combination with the single lug tube coupling of Fig. 14 and 14b or the four lug tube coupling of Figs. 15a and 15b to affix tubular barriers to the warning device of Fig. 1. It can be used as a sign support in combination with the sign support bracket of Figs. 25a, 25b and 25c or the ground plate of Figs. 27a, 27b and 27c. It can also be used in combination with the components of Figs. 19, 20, 21 and 22 to form the tensioner assembly shown in Fig. 23. This tensioner assembly can be used to tension the barrier clip of Fig. 30.Figs. 24a and 24b show a warning light for fixing to the top of the central tube of the warning device of Fig. 1. The batteries for the lamp fit inside the device at 13 and the lamp is operated by a locating and earthing screw 14. Figs. 25a, 25b and 25c show a sign support bracket. This bracket can be fitted to signs and removes the necessity for metal framing. The ground pin shown in Figs. 26a and 26b can be used to stabilise the legs of the device of Fig. 1 or the ground plate of Fig. 27.The ground plate of Figs. 27a, 27b and 27c allows barriers and signs to be fixed to the ground, using the ground pins of Figs. 26a and 26b, or to walls and rock faces using rails or bolts.The barrier clamps shown in Figs. 28 and 29 can be fitted in pairs to motorway barriers to support signs on the central reservation. The signs fit between the two clamps and thus hold the clamps in position.Alternatively, the barrier clamp shown in Fig. 30 can be used. This has a built in tensionery device and is thus self supporting when fitted to a barrier. An example of a suitable tensioner is shown in Fig. 31.Modifications and improvements may be incorporated without departing from the scope of the invention.
