# IMPROVEMENT IN STEPPER MOTORS

## Abstract
The rotor of a stepper motor comprises a toothed cup or plate 1 2 of soft iron surrounding a freely rotatable permanent magnet 1 7 .

## Claims
1. A stepper motor having a rotor system comprising a pair of toothed rotors 1 2 of soft magnetic material fixed to the rotor shaft 1 1 and a permanent magnet 1 7 freely rotatable on the rotor shaft, the rotors and permanent magnet being so arranged that the rotor act as pole pieces for the magnet, being separated from it by an air gap 1 8 sufficient to allow free rotation.

## Description
The present invention relates to stepper motors, and provides an improved stepper motor in low inertia. This application is divided out of European patent application EP 83305856.3, publication number 0106595. The invention is defined in the claims appended hereto, and will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which A cup shaped rotor stepper motor with low inertia and high frequency response is shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 2 shows a front view of the cup shaped magnetic conductor. A motor according to this invention may be used in a machine tool as described in the parent specification, or other mechanical device, and in general industrial servo drive means. It comprises a conventional stepper motor stator, a cup shaped rotor 1 2 , and the related mechanical parts the novel feature of the cup shaped rotor system 1 2 is that it comprises two or more than sets of cup shaped rotors having a selected size and number of teeth around its outer circumference, and an output shaft to form a rotor assembly, in which the angle relation between the salient teeth is determined by the corresponding structure of the stator. Said cup shaped rotor assembly is to be excited with a permanent magnet 1 7 that is mounted on the output shaft by bearings, and between said permanent magnet 1 7 and the cup shaped rotor assembly, a suitable play is furnished therefore, when said cup shaped rotor assembly is driven by the stator to rotate the output shaft, the permanent magnet 1 7 will only be subject to friction damping mechanical force, so that the mechanical inertia of the rotor assembly is lowered and high frequency response improved. Fig. 3 to 6 shows other embodiments of this design, in which the rotor may be flat or conical, but the operation and functions are the same as those shown in Fig. 1 and 2.
