# Axial clearance adjustment mechanism for scroll type fluid displacement apparatus.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus 10 is dis closed having an adjustment mechanism for adjusting the axial clearance between the spiral elements 252, 262 and end plates 251, 261 of the fixed 25 and orbiting scrolls 26 . The axial position of the fixed scroll 25 within the casing of the apparatus and, therefore, the axial clearance between scrolls 25, 26 is adjustable by means of the locating mechanism, such as an adjusting screw 50 threadably engaged with the end plate 121 of the casing 12 and in contact with the end plate 251 of the fixed scroll 25 . The fixed scroll 25 is stabilized within the casing 12 to maintain parallelism of the scroll end plates 251, 261 by mating, rela tively axially slidable guide projections on the end plate 251 of the fixed scroll 25 and the end plate 121 of the casing 12 .
