## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HIGH PURITY ALUMINA FROM BAUXITE This invention relates to a process for treating bauxite to make high purity alumina. Bauxites are reacted with caustic soda solution at elevated temperatures to dissolve the alumina and, after cooling, the resultant slurry is separated into insoluble matter and a pregnant liquor from which alumina hydrate can be precipitated. The alumina hydrate will contain some iron oxide and, if this is above 0.017 Fe203, its value is decreased, as it is difficult to make high purity aluminum from the alumina hydrate. The pregnant liquor, resulting from the reaction of bauxite and caustic soda, contains iron oxide in the form of ferric and ferrous iron, which will both co precipitate with the alumina hydrate. The higher the digestion temperature, the greater is the amount of ferrous iron solubilized from the bauxite. The ferric iron is easily removed, using simple filtrating techniques, such as filtering the pregnant liquor through paper, sand or a synthetic cloth, whereas the ferrous iron, being in a colloidal or soluble state, is difficult to filter out unless sophisticated techniques are used, such as filtering the pregnant liquor through a bed of sand, iron grit see U. S. Patent 3,792,542 or bauxite see U. S. Patent 3,728,432 where the ferrous iron adheres to those particles due to van Der Waals forces.The disadvantages of these methods using beds of iron grit or bauxite are the high capital cost of this type of filter, difficulty in operating and increased operating cost attributable to purchasing and installing the bed. Filtration techniques, using membranes of synthetic cloth, are simpler to operate and arse used widely in the industry. In the laboratory, membranes of caustic resistant paper are used and can duplicate industrial filtration, using synthetic cloths. Bauxites, which originate from such areas as theDarling Ranges and the Gove Peninsula in Australia or the Trombetas area of Brazil, need only be reacted with caustic soda solutions at temperatures from 113 C to 2050C so little ferrous iron is formed and the alumina hydrate generally contains less than 0.017 Fe203. Bauxites, which originate from such areas as Weipa in Australia or Boke in West Africa, are reacted with spent caustic soda solutions, generally at more elevated temperatures ranging from 206 C to 35boy, so a greater amount of ferrous iron is formed and the alumina hydrate can contain more than 0.017 Fe203 unless sophisticated techniques are used to remove all or part of the ferrous iron. In another method see U. S. Patent 3,607,140 , the iron impurities in the liquor are co precipitated with a small amount of alumina hydrate. However, this is a sophisticated techique and consumes additional energy to redigest the alumina hydrate precipitated with the iron impurities. In U. S. Patent 4,324,769, a double digestion process is shown which lowered the iron oxide in alumina to less than 0.03 if in the second digest the mud was mixed with bauxite in the ratio of 0.1 to 2.5 times the weight of bauxite. It has now been found that this patent can be improved and is the subject of this application. To produce alumina hydrate economically and to be able to sell it, an alumina process must meet all the following constraints low energy usage, minimum capital cost, high extraction efficiency and low iron oxide in the alumina hydrate. Other prior art either does not meet these constraints or are unlike applicant s process of this invention. A process described in the publication entitled Extraction of Alumina from Ferruginous Bauxite by aDouble Leech Process by W. F. Holbrook and L. A.Yerkes and published by the U. S. Department ofInterior is designed primarily for bauxites containing more than ten percent silica and entails calcining the bauxite, removing the reactive silica by leeching with ten percent caustic soda at 90 C, separating the solids from the liquor, regenerating the caustic in this liquor with lime and recirculating the liquor back to the leeching zone. Another prior art process is discussed in U. S.Scondrett Patent 2,852,343. Two different bauxites are digested in two parallel digestive units. One bauxite is predominately trihydrate the other is a mixture of trihydrate and monohydrate alumina. This process is unlike applicant s process of this invention. Another prior art process is discussed in U. S.Porter Patent 2,701,751, entitled Process for Production of Alumina and issued February 8, 1955. The process disclosed requires the liquor obtained from the second digester unit at an A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.42 to 0.54 be recycled to the first digester unit in order to raise its A1203 to NaOH weight ratio to 0.8 before it can be routed to precipitation. This recycling of the hot monohydrate alumina extraction liquor from separatory unit 2 back to the first or trihydrate digester unit upsets the heat balance on this first digester unit. That is, the temperature of the first digester effluent after the flash tank will exceed 112 C because not enough steam can be flashed to the liquor heater and condensed by the hot recycled liquor so excessive heat losses will occur.The process described by Porter may have been acceptable when oil was 3.00 per barrel, but causes excessive heat loss for it to be used today. Porter s patent can be improved and the heat losses reduced by thirty percent by setting the conditions in the second digester unit so that the A1203 to NaOH weight ratio can be increased above 0.75 and the monohydrate extraction liquor then routed directly to precipitation. This, however, would not then be Porter s patent but the subject of one improvement made in this application by applicant. Another prior art process is discussed in AustraliaSeimiya, et al Patent 269,395 entitled Process forExtracting Alumina from Bauxite Containing Both AluminaMonohydrate and Trihydrate . This patent discloses an unground bauxite in lump or granular form which is placed in a packed column and contacted with caustic soda at 100 C to 140 C to dissolve the trihydrate and leave the monohydrate undissolved. The effluent from this column is separated into sodium aluminate solution, granular residue and muddy substance. The muddy substance is discarded, the lump or granular form residue of generally plus 20 mesh containing some alumina monohydrate is digested in an autoclave digester with fresh alkali solution at a temperature greater than 160 C. The digester effluent is separated into sodium aluminate solution and a red mud which is discarded. The alumina in the sodium aluminate solution is recovered in precipitation. This process has two serious disadvantages which can be improved as 1 it is impractical to pack a large enough column for industrial use with lumpy or unground bauxite and 2 the muddy substance discarded from the first digest can contain significant amounts of monohydrate alumina and make the process uneconomical and this is indicated in the two examples quoted by the low extraction rate of 89.5 and 90.1 , respectively. Seimiya s patent can be improved by grinding the bauxite in caustic liquor so it can be pumped in slurry form into digesters to be reacted with caustic soda.The grinding of the bauxite makes a majority of the monohydrate alumina report to the muddy substance and not to the granular residue and the alumina monohydrate can then be extracted from the muddy substance and this is one improvement considered in this application byMcDaniels. Therefore. one object of this invention is to grind the bauxite with spent caustic soda solution and pump the bauxite slurry into autoclave digesters so that packed columns of lumpy bauxite do not have to be used. Another object of this invention is to extract the monohydrate alumina from the muddy substance and extract greater than ninety two percent of the total available alumina in the bauxite Another object of this invention is to discard a granular residue so that this material does not erode tubular slurry heat exchangers. Another object of this invention is to provide a process to minimize solubilizing the ferrous iron from bauxites which have to be reacted with spent caustic soda solution at temperatures ranging from 206 C to 350 C so that the pregnant liquor produced can be filtered using simple techniques, such as filtering through paper. sand or a synthetic cloth and the alumina hydrate precipitated will contain less than 0 017 iron oxide by weight Another object of this invention is to filter pregnant liquor through a synthetic cloth with a lime filter aid so that the filtrate contains less than 0 013 grams per litre Foe03 Another object of this invention is to improve the double digestion process and reduce the energy consumption thirty percent by having an A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.75 1.05 in the pregnant slurry leaving the digester unit operating at 206 C to 3500C so that the second pregnant liquor stream from the separatory unit can be routed directly to precipitation at an A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0 75 to 1.05 and, therefore, not have to be routed back to the digester unit operating at 113 C to 205 C to have its A1203 to NaOH weight ratio increased to a level of 0.75 to 1.05, that which is the ratio required for precipitation to be carried out. Another object of this invention is to design a double digestion process so that the heat added to digestion will be less than 2.3 million British ThermalUnits per ton of alumina hydrate precipitated. Another object of this invention is to recover the heat in the digester effluent so its temperature is below 112 C for maximum steam and heat recovery. These and other objects and advantages of this invention shall become apparent from the ensuing descriptions of the invention. Accordingly, a bauxite is ground with a spent caustic soda solution and pumped as a slurry into digesters and reacted at a temperature ranging from 113 C to 205 C with additional spent caustic soda solution, the effluent is cooled in flash tanks to 88 C to 1120 C, a granular residue is classified out and discarded, a pregnant slurry is separated into a muddy substance and a first pregnant liquor which is filtered, cooled to 500C to 87 C and routed to precipitation with an A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.75 to 1.05, the muddy substance is reacted in a digester with or without a small amount of bauxite but with a spent caustic soda stream at 2060C to 350 C, the pregnant slurry or digester effluent is cooled in flash tanks to 880C to 112 C and then separated into a second pregnant liquor and a red mud which is discarded, the second pregnant liquor with an A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.75 to 1.05 is filtered, cooled to 50 C to 87 C and routed to precipitation, alumina hydrate seed is added to the combined filtered pregnant liquor in precipitation to precipitate alumina hydrate which is then separated from a spent caustic soda solution.The spent caustic soda solution is then recirculated to the bauxite grinding vessel and the two digestion units. A portion of the separated alumina hydrate is recycled as seed, the remainder is washed with hot water and will contain less than 0.017 Fe203. Reference is now made to the accompany drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a flowsheet illustrating one preferred embodiment of this invention. Referring now to Figure 1, bauxite is ground to less than 0.2 inches but preferably to less than 0.1 inches with a spent caustic soda stream in vessel 1 to form a bauxite slurry. The bauxite slurry is pumped into reaction vessel 2 and reacted at 113 C to 205 C for 2 200 minutes with more spent caustic soda solution to form a stream of pregnant liquor granular residue and muddy substance. Heat is added to reaction vessel 2 but can also be added as hot flux or boiler steam to heat exchange vessel 17. The bauxite is kept in suspension in reaction vessel 2 and this vessel does not contain a packed column of lumpy bauxite. The effluent from reaction vessel 2 is cooled, preferably in vessel 3 to 88 C to 1120C, with steam flashing to heat exchanger 16. The effluent from vessel 3 is classified or screened at a 10 to 100 mesh cut but preferably at 20 mesh to separate a granular residue stream from a first pregnant slurry stream. The granular residue stream is sent to disposal as it causes erosion problems in tubular heat exchangers. The first pregnant slurry stream from vessel 4 is introduced into separatory unit 5 and separated into a muddy substance stream and a first pregnant liquor stream with an A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.75 to 1.05. The first pregnant liquor stream is filtered in vessel 6 comprising a synthetic cloth or sand bed to give a first filtrate stream which is introduced into cooling vessel 7 and cooled to 50 C to 87 C with steam flashing to heat exchanger 14. The muddy substance stream is introduced into second reaction vessel 8 either directly or via heat exchanger 15. Spent caustic soda solution is heated in heat exchanger 15, 18 and then introduced into vessel 8. Heat, either as boiler steam or a hot salt, is added either to vessel 8 or heat exchanger 18.Reaction vessel 8 provides 2 200 minutes holding time at 206 C to 250 C to extract the monohydrate alumina from the muddy substance and a second pregnant slurry is formed comprising a second pregnant liquor stream and a red mud stream. The second pregnant slurry stream is cooled to 880C to 112 C in vessel 9 with steam flashing to heat exchanger 15, then introduced into separatory unit 10 and separated into the red mud stream and second pregnant liquor stream. The red mud stream is discarded and the second pregnant liquor stream having a A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.75 to 1.05 is filtered in vessel 11 having either a synthetic cloth or sand bed to produce a second filtrate stream. In a preferred embodiment, a lime filter aid can be used in filter vessel 11. The second filtrate stream is introduced into vessel 79 and cooled to 50 to 87 C with steam flashing to heater 14. The first and second filtrate streams of A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.75 to 1.05 are combined, cooled and introduced to vessel 12 with alumina hydrate seed added to vessel 12 to produce as a precipitant the desired alumina hydrate having less than 0.017 by weight Fe203. The precipitant stream is introduced to hydrate separatory unit 13 and separated into a spent caustic soda stream and an alumina hydrate stream. A portion of the alumina hydrate stream is recirculated to vessel 12 as seed, the remainder is washed with hot water for product. The spent caustic soda stream is recirculated back to vessel 1, 2, 8 and new caustic soda is added to make up for losses. Heat added to digestion is the total British ThermalUnits added to vessels 2, 8 and heat exchangers 17, 18 and can be in the form of boiler house steam, hot salt or hot oil. The heat used in the digestion process is shown in British Thermal Units per hour or per ton of alumina hydrate precipitated. In an alternate preferred embodiment, it has been found that alumina hydrate containing less than 0.017 Fe203 by weight can still be precipitated if a proportion of bauxite is mixed with the muddy substance stream before reacting with spent caustic soda streams at temperatures ranging from 206 C to 350 C, however, the proportion of bauxite added should not exceed 0.4 times the weight of muddy substance. Conversely, the ratio of muddy substance to bauxite must be greater than 2.5, i.e, Bauxite Less than 0.4, Mud conversely, Mud Greater 1 Greater 2.5 Bauxite 0.4If the bauxite is between 0.4 to 2.5 times the weight of muddy substance, the alumina hydrate can contain 0.0178 to 0.02 Fe203 but generally less than 0.02 Fe203 by weight of alumina hydrate. Caustic soda solutions can be used ranging in concentration from 100 to 425 grams per litre NaOH but more preferably in the range of 120 to 200 grams per litreNaOH. Caustic soda solutions can be used which contain residual amounts of alumina and are then called spent caustic soda solutions or spent liquor but the weight ratio of A1203 to NaOH should not exceed 0.55. The pregnant liquor resulting from the reaction of bauxite and caustic soda solutions or bauxite mixed with muddy substance or muddy substance only should have A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.75 to 1.05 to satisfy precipitation requirements. The concentration of caustic soda in grams per litre NaOH can be expressed in equivalent terms ofNa2CO3 by multiplying by 1.325 or in equivalent terms of Na2O by multiplying by 0.775. It has been found that if pregnant liquor when filtered contains less than 0.013 grams per litreFe203 in the filtrate, the alumina hydrate precipitated should contain less than 0.017 Fe203 by weight. The total available alumina in a bauxite can be defined as that alumina which can be extracted at most favorable digest conditions, such as high caustic concentration, high temperature and low A1203 toNaOH weight ratio in the resulting sodium aluminate liquor. One such condition for determining total available alumina would be caustic concentration 200 grams per litre NaOH, 250 C, A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.45. Such a low A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of liquor gives very high alumina extraction but does not contain enough dissolved alumina to be routed to precipitation and as such, an economic balance must be achieved between alumina extraction and precipitation for alumina processes. The double digestion process has been improved to 1 minimize solubilizing ferrous iron when monohydrate has to be extracted from bauxite so that simple filtration techniques can be used to produce alumina hydrate containing less than 0.017 Fe203, 2 extract the monohydrate from the muddy substance, 3 use less than 2.3 millionBritish Thermal Units in digestion per ton of alumina hydrate precipitated, and 4 recover heat from the digest ter effluent as its temperature is reduced to below 112 C to feed the separatory units. Example 1 is exemplary of a procedure not utilizing the preferred embodiments of this invention.

The flash tank effluent was separated in a settler into pregnant liquor and red mud. 853 tons per day of red mud containing 108 total available alumina was washed with hot water and discarded.The pregnant liquor was pumped to a filter and filtered through a synthetic cloth with a lime filter aid. The filtrate of A1203 to NaOH weight ratio of 0.8 was cooled in a flash tank to 700C with steam flashing to a heater. The combined filtrate analyzed 0.010 grams per litre Fe203 and was pumped to a precipitator where seed was added from the settler. Precipitation was carried out for 30 hours and 2654 tons per day of alumina hydrate was precipitated. The alumina hydrate was separated from the spent liquor in the settler, seed was recirculated to a precitator and 2654 tons per day of alumina hydrate was washed with hot water for product and analyzed 0.013 Fe203. 94.6 of the total available alumina was extracted from the bauxite and 1090 million British Thermal Units was added to the digesters per ton of alumina hydrate precipitated containing 0.013 Fe203. There are, of course, other modifications of this invention not specifically described, but which are intended to be included within the scope of this invention as defined by the following claims.
