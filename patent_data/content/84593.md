# Phosphate conversion coatings for metals with reduced weights and crystal sizes.

## Abstract
A method and material for forming phosphate conver sion coatings on ferrous metals such as iron and steel or non ferrous metals such as zinc and aluminium employes aqueous acidic solutions containing a metal phosphates such as zinc phosphate, an accelerator such as sodium nitrite, and a crystal refining material which is an acidic organic phosphate or pnosphonate having at least one free alcohol ic hydroxyl group and where the phosphate is derived from a cyclic or branched chain organic alcohol.
