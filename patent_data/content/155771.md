# Improvements relating to hydraulic fluid supply systems.

## Abstract
A pump 1 supplies hydraulic fluid from a reservoir 2 to hydraulically operated equipment 4 through a main flow line 3, the fluid being returned to the reservoir 2 through a return supply line 5. If the pump 1 should fail the equipment 4 may be supplied from an independent pump unit which can be connected to flow and return lines 6, 7. Because the pump 1 has failed it will be incapable of operating a dump valve 15 so the fluid will not be fed to the reservoir 2. Should there be a blockage in the equipment 4 pressure will build up in a relief valve 13 which will therefore open to allow the fluid to pass directly to the return line 5 or 7 . If the system is to be used as a source of pressurised hydraulic fluid for another unit then a change over valve 12 will be operated to de couple the unit 4 and allow the fluid to pass to the other unit through the auxiliary supply lines 6, 7.
