## Description
This invention relates to apparatus for use in playing a game. There have been a number of earlier proposals of target devices for use for amusement and for practicing ball games. One such example is described in US A 4 199 141 which describes a target device having on an outer face a number of target areas. These target areas are provided with detection elements and are connected to indicator menas so that an audio and visual display is provided when the ball strikes the target. A drawback with such apparatus is that it cannot easily be used to simulate team games such as soccer where, in the full size game, two separate goal areas are required. The previous apparatus while capable of indicating a hit, or goal is not capable of allocating the credit for such a goal to one of a pair of teams. According to the present invention there is provided game apparatus comprising a target having objective areas provided with detection means actuable when the objective area is struck and indicator means adapted for actuation by said detection means when the area is struck the target comprising an upstanding target having a front face presented in a first direction and a rear face presented in a direction opposite to the front face, first pressure sensitive switch means associated with the front face which actuates upon application of pressure to the front face, second pressure sensitive switch means, electrical circuit means including said first and second switch means and electrical indicator means connected with the electrical circuit means, the indicator means being actuated on actuation of said first or second switch means characterised in that the second pressure sensitive means is associated with the rear face and actuates upon application of pressure to the rear face. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Referring to Figs. 1 to 4 of the drawings, a first embodiment of a target comprises a base 1 having a central section 1A and side sections 1B which are hinged at 2 to the central section 1A. The base 1 has an upward stub projection 3 which fits within a corresponding recess in a lower portion of an upright post 4. The post is of generally elliptical cross section, and can be removed from the stub projection 3 and stored within a recess 5 in the underside of the base 1, and enclosed therein by hingeing the sections 1B of the base so as to lie below the central section 1A. The opposed faces of the post 4 are formed by pressure sensitive pads 6A, 6B which are differently coloured, the pads 6A, 6B each providing a switch which completes a respective electrical circuit to actuate a buzzer and light disposed in an upper area 7 of the post. The lights 7A, 7B are differently coloured, and the circuitry is powered by batteries. The post 4 is 1.35m in height and the base is 1.05m in overall width and 1.25m in overall length. A lightweight ball which actuates the pressure sensitive pads 4 on striking them is also provided, and the game is played as follows The game can be played by 2, 4, 6 or 8 people split into opposing sides. The game commences at the beginning and after each goal by bouncing the ball off at a point approximately 10 metres from the post 4 along the midline of the post 4. Opposing teams then play as in football with the object being to score goals by kicking the ball against an appropriate one of the pressure sensitive pads 6A, 6B to score a goal for one side or the other. The ball may not be handled by any player. An agreed time limit is set before each game and the team with most goals at the end of the period wins. Referring to Figs. 7 and 8 of the drawings a second embodiment of a target is illustrated. This is similar to the embodiment described above but has smaller overall dimensions for ease of portability. In addition instead of a solid base the post 4 is supported by poles, not shown, which are inserted into sockets 10 on the base 1 of the target. A series of discs 11 mounted on runners 12 can be used as score indicators. The layout of batteries 13 and electronic circuits 14 is illustrated in Fig. 8. The overall height of the target is 0.95m with the height to the top of the pressure sensitive pads 0.85m and the width 0.64m. The base is 0.20m deep and the post 0.17m deep. The base support poles are formed from 30mm box section metal and are 0.85m long. The faces of the post forming the objective or target areas are each formed by 22 guage sheet metal each covered with a pair of security alarm pads. These pads comprise a foam layer with 10mm diameter holes cut out at approximately 20mm from each other. The foam layer is enclosed between two aluminium foil backed sheets attached to wires. This composite structure is enclosed in a sealed plastic envelope which leaves two wires extending. The pads are fixed to the post by double sided adhesive tape. The two sides are distinguished using coloured adhesive carpet backing tape. Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the basic electronic circuitry of the target. When one side of the post is hit by the ball there is a reduction in resistance between the controls of the pad A or B Fig. 6 on that side. The reduction in resistance is detected by circuit 15 or 16 and the appropriate light A or B is illuminated and the siren operated. The light A or B is illuminated in each case for a period longer than that during which the siren sounds. While either light is on the circuit will not respond to either pressure pad. As a function check both lights are illuminated and the siren sounds when the power supply is switched on. Figs. 9 20 illustrate a third embodiment of a target. In this embodiment the base support poles consist of a pair of U shaped metal poles which are resiliently biased into sockets on the base of the target. The U shaped poles act as base supports and also define no go areas during play. The poles are also designed to fold up around the sides and over the top of the post for transport and storage. This embodiment is similar to that shown in Figs. 7 and 8 but the post 4 has a modified upper area 7 which provides a neater construction. Fig. 21 illustrates a fourth embodiment of a target. This embodiment is similar to that shown in Figs. 9 20 but is of smaller overall dimensions. This embodiment is thus more easily portable than the previous embodiments. The base support poles also fold around the sides of the post 4 to form handles for ease of transportation. Fig. 22 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a basic framework for a target. As can be seen the base 1, sides and upper area 7 are formed from steel channel sections to form a rigid framework for the target. The batteries 13 and electronic circuits 14 are also mounted on a similar steel channel section. Figs. 23 28 illustrate details of a further embodiment of a target. This target is identical in function to the earlier embodiments but differs in constructional details. The basic construction of this embodiment is similar to that illustrated in Fig. 22 with the base 1, sides and upper area 7 being formed from steel channel sections. The pressure sensitive pads 6A and 6B extend between the side sections. The embodiments illustrated are only by way of example. Various modifications and additional features are also envisaged. A number of alternative detecting means are possible. Examples of these are The basic audible warning device may be supplemented or replaced by a bell, a whistle noise or a crowd cheering noise and the length of time for which the sound operates may be varied. In addition to the embodiments described the target may be produced in a variety of different sizes for different applications. Such different applications may require the use of different materials. For example various different plastics or combinations of metal and plastics may be used. The base may also be of plastics, metal or concrete as appropriate.
