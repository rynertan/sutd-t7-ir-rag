## Description
ALPHA ALOGENATED AROMATIC COMPOUNDS AS PHOTOINITIATORS Field of the Invention The present invention relates to processes and compositions for photopolymerization using alphahalogenated aromatic compounds as photoinitiators.Background of the Invention Photopolymerization of unsaturated compositions in which a photoinitiating compound is included in the polymerizable mass is well known in the art.The process has many advantages over thermal polymerization and is particularly useful where long shelf life combined with rapid hardening at low temperature is desirable. Photoinitiating compounds must absorb light and utilize the energy so acquired to initiate polymerization. A large number of compounds have been found useful as photoinitiators for the polymerization of unsaturated compounds. Among those heretofore in most common usage in industry are the benzoin ethers of primary and secondary alcohols such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol. Also, compounds such as phenyl glyoxal and l phenyl butane 1,2 dione are disclosed as photosensitizers in U.S. Patent No.2,413,973. Additionally, various acetophenone compounds such as 2,2 diethoxyacetophenone are claimed to have photoinitiating capability in U.S. Patent No. 3,715,293. U.S. Patent No. 4,360,540 to J. A. Chong indicates at Col. 5, line 9 that polychlorinated aromatic compounds are suitable photoinitiators but does not further define the structure of such compounds. In U.S. PatentNo. 4,239,609 to H. Barzynski et al. it is proposed to use a photoinitiator system of a major amount of at least one aromatic carbonyl compound, as the photoinitiator, and, a lesser amount of a benzene compound having at least two dichloromethyl groups CHC12 bound to the benzene nucleus e.g., the bis dichloromethyl benzenes . The benzene compound is characterized as an activator for aromatic carbonyl photoinitiators, rather than as photoinitiators themselves.Summary of the Present Invention It has now been found that certain alpha halogenated compounds are indeed effective as photoinitiators in monomeric and polymeric compositions of photopolymerizable substances. The photopolymerizable compositions consist essentially of compounds of the formula EMI2.1 where X is halogen, e.g., chlorine, R is X or hydrogen,R, is hydrogen or C, C6 alkyl, and n is 1 to 4. Detailed Description of the Present Invention The compositions curable by actinic radiation according to the invention can contain a photopolymerizable polymer in a reactive ethylenically unsaturated monomeric medium, a reactive polymer alone, a reactive monomer alone, or any of these combined with an inert solvent. Additionally, the polymerizable composition can contain any of the pigments commonly used in photopolymerization techniques. The process can be carried out by mixing a quantity of photoinitiating compound of the present invention with a photopolymerizable composition and exposing the resultant mixture to actinic radiation. Alternatively, a one component system comprising the photopolymerizable composition, the photoinitiator of the invention and, if desired, pigmentation, can be formed. The photoinitiating compounds of the invention are suitable in the actinic light curing of unsaturated monomeric compounds either alone or as copolymerizable constituents of unsaturated polymer monomer systems.Such systems are composed of mixtures of conventional unsaturated polymers and unsaturated monomers. Monomers which are useful in practicing the invention are acrylic, alkacrylic and r C chloro acrylic acid compounds such as esters, amides and nitriles. Examples of such compounds are acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, methacrylamide and methyl chloroacrylate. Also useful, although not preferred due to their slower rates of reactivity, are vinyl and vinylidene esters, ethers and ketones. Additionally, compounds having more than one terminal unsaturation can be used.Examples of these include diallyl phthalate, diallyl maleate, diallyl fumarate, triallyl cyanurate, triallyl phosphate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, glycerol trimethacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, methacrylic anhydride, and allyl ethers of monohydroxy or polyhydroxy compounds such as ethylene glycol diallyl ether, pentaerythritol tetraallyl ether, and the like, Nonterminally unsaturated compounds such as diethyl fumarate can similarly be used. The acrylic acid derivatives are particularly well suited to the practice of the invention and are consequently preferred components as monomers in monomer containing polymerizable systems and as reactive centers in polymerizable polymers. While monomeric styrene can be used in the practice of the invention, it is not a preferred constituent of systems polymerizable thereby due to its slow rate of reaction. A preferred manner of practicing the invention is by the use of photopolymerizable molding and coating compositions which comprise mixtures of unsaturated polymeric compounds and monomeric compounds copolymerizable therewith. The polymeric compounds can be conventional polyesters prepared from unsaturated polycarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, glutaconic acid, itaconic acid, citraconic acid, mesaconic acid and the like, and polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, propylene glycol, 1,2 butanediol, 4 butanediol, pentaerythritol, trimethylolpropane and the like. The carboxylic acid content can also contain saturated components.The inclusion of a monobasic fatty acid content, either as such or in the form of a triglyceride or oil, in the photopolmerizable polyester composition to comprise an alkyd resin is also acceptable. These resins can, in turn, be modified by silicones, epoxides, isocyanates, etc., by known techniques. Additionally, the photopolymerizable composition can contain a sensitizer capable of enhancing the photoinitiating reactivity of the photoinitiating compound of the invention. Examples of sensitizers useful in the practice of the invention are such compounds as xanthone, thioxanthone, acetophenone and the like. These are typically added in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 6 weight percent. The techniques whereby such sensitizers are selected for use in conjunction with particular photoinitiators are well known in the art. See for example, Murov, Handbook of Photochemistry, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York 1973 . Thus it is seen that the constitution of photopolymerizable compositions which can be used in the practice of the invention is widely variable. However, the compounds enumerated above are purely illustrative.Materials subject to polymerization by actinic radiation as well as permissible variations and substitutions of equivalent components within particular types of compositions are well known to those skilled in the art. The compounds which function as photoinitiators in accordance with the present invention are known for other uses and are easily synthesized by known means. The photoinitiators of the invention can be utilized in amounts ranging from 0.01 to about 30 by weight based on the photopolymerizable composition.However, preferable amounts of the compounds are from about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent with optimal results being achieved with amounts in the range of from about 1.0 to about 16 weight percent. An acceptable source of actinic light radiation is any apparatus which emits light radiation in the approximate region of about 2000 Angstroms to about 8000 Angstroms and preferably between about 2400Angstroms and 54000 Angstroms. One such apparatus is PPG Model QC 1202, a W processor manufactured byPPG Industries, Inc. The present invention is illustrated by theExample which follows. TEST PROCEDURE USED IN THE EXAMPLES The induced rate of photopolymerization of a standard test solution of acrylate alkyd resin was measured for each of the compounds which were tested.This standard test solution consisted of 42 , by weight, trimethylolpropane triacrylate TMPTA , 17 , by weight, of ethylhexyl acrylate EHA , and 41 , by weight, of an unsaturated long chain linseed oil alkyd resin ACTOMER X 80 brand from Union Carbide . The test solution was exposed to light radiation from a light source PPG Model OC 1202 which contained two high intensity, medium pressure quartz mercury lamps, 12 inches in length, with each operating at a linear power density of about 200 watts per inch or 2400 watts per lamp. The lamps were housed in an elliptical reflector above a variable speed conveyor belt so that each lamp provided a 2 inch band of high flux actinic radiation on the conveyor. This 2 inch exposure area was bordered on both sides by an additional 2 inch area of medium flux energy for a total radiation area of 6 inches for each lamp. In the curing data presented herein, the cure rate of the polymerizable compositions is presented in feet per minute per lamp ft. min. lamp .Thus, a conveyor belt speed of one foot min. will, with a 12 inch exposure area for the two lamps, provide 60 seconds of exposure or a cure rate of 0.5 ft. min. lamp. Similarly, a belt speed of 10 ft. min. will provide 6 seconds of exposure or a rate of 5.0 ft. min. lamp, while a speed of 20.0 ft. min. will give 3 seconds exposure or a rate of 10 ft. min. lamp. The extent of curing was determined by a standard pencil hardness test with all samples being coated on aluminum plate to a thickness of 2 mils and polymerized to achieve a standard pencil hardness of from 4H to 6H where this was attainable. EXAMPLE This Example illustrates the photoefficiency of various alpha chlorinated aromatic compounds in accordance with the present invention when used at 4 wt. loading in the standard test solution Cure Rate Compound feet min. lamp 2,3,5,6, alpha, alpha, alpha , alpha , octachloro E xylene 13 2,4,5,6, alpha, alpha, alpha , alpha , octachloro m xylene 13 In the formula X chlorine, n 4, R chlorine and R,thyarogen.
