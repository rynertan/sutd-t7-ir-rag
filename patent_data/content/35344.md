# METHOD AND SPRAY DRYING APPARATUS FOR ATOMIZING LIQUID MATERIAL

## Abstract
In a spray drying apparatus comprising a rotating atomiz er wheel 1 and an overlying stationary liquid distributor, the risk of deposition of dried liquid particles in the region between the edge of a central aperture 7 in a cover 5 for the atomizer wheel 1 and a part 7 of the liquid distributor projecting thereinto is removed or reduced to a considerable extent by supplying to said region an amount of liquid which is small rela tive to the supplied amount of liquid to be atomized. Adjacent to the liquid distributor, at least one passage 20 is provided for supplying said amount of liquid with its outlet opposite the atomizer wheel cover 5 . The passage outlet 20 may either be positioned at a greater radial distance from the wheel axis than the supply passages 17 in the liquid distributor for the li quid to be atomized, so that the supply of said amount of liquid possibly together with supply of compressed air takes place in atomized form, or said passage may be constituted by an an nular slit limited by a funnel enclosing said part of the liquid dis tributor, whereby the supply of said amount of liquid results in continuous rinsing of the parts exposed to deposit formation.
