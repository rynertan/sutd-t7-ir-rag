# Methods of producing images by NMR techniques.

## Abstract
A set of NMR free induction signals generated in nuclei in a sample are recorded in the presence of a magnetic field gradient to a static magnetic field in which the sample is positioned. Prior to recording a magnetic field gradient orthogonal to the said gradient is applied to phase encode the signals. The individual signals of a set are differentiated by being recorded after different time integrals of the phase encoding gradient. The magnitudes of successive time integrals have a non monotonic relationship with each other so that sufficient signal data is recorded to enable the Fourier transform operation to commence before half or less of the set of signals has been recorded. Preferably the relationship between the magnitudes of successive time integrals corres ponds to a numerical sequence represented by a monotonic sequence of binary numbers re arranged in bit reversed order.
