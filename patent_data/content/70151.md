# PACKS PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR DETERGENT POWDER

## Abstract
A pack intended to contain a solid substance such as a detergent powder from which liquid has a tendency to bleed is constructed to reduce the extent of such bleeding. The construction involves the provision on the inside of the pack of a surface having an open pored structure. The open pored structure has been found to reduce capillary attraction of liquid for the carton. Open pored structures can be formed using, for example, non woven fabrics, foamed board or sintered materials.
