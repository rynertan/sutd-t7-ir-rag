# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SUPPORTS FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC PAPER

## Abstract
A process for producing supports for a photographic paper which comprises applying a layer of a composition containing an unsaturated organic compound capable of being polymerized or hardened upon irradiation with electron beams and an inorganic white pigment to a support, irradiat ing the layer with a first irradiation with electron beams to incompletely harden the unsaturated organic compound, pressing the incompletely hardened layer against the surface of a roll to transfer the surface configuration of the roll to the layer, and then further irradiating the layer with a second irradiation with electron beams to more fully harden the unsa turated organic compound in the layer.
