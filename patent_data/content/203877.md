# Turbine module assembly device.

## Abstract
A first turbine rotor hub 32 and a second turbine rotor hub 42 each have respective internal splines 52, 62 which engage coaxial, non concentric external splines 54, 64 on a shaft 20 and are in thrust bearing relationship coopera ting, circumferentially disposed, radially inwardly extending lugs 35, 45 on each hub 32, 42 define radially inwardly extending projections 80 . A resilient split metal band 60 , having circumferentially disposed apertures 61 overlies the projections 80 which extend through the apertures 61 . The uninstalled diameter of the band is greater than the in stalled diameter such that the band is self retaining. The assembly requires no bolts between the rotor stages 30 and 40 to hold the two stages together.
