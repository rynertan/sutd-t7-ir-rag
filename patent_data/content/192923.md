# Apparatus for internally embossing trays formed from a foil of foamed plastics by a continuous hot molding machine.

## Abstract
The apparatus of the invention, which is particularly adapted for being applied to a continuous rotary hot molding machine for forming trays V or any other containers of a relatively limited depth from a foil 9 of foamed plastics, is provided for internally embossing the bottom walls of said trays. The apparatus comprises elements constructed in form of wheels, which are one for each single longitudinal row of cavities 104 of the multiple molds 4 , and which are keyed to a rotary shaft 11 arranged parallel to the shaft 2 of the mold carrying drum 1 in the hot molding machine, and per pendicularly to the forward direction of the foil. Each one of these wheel elements carries in its periphery any desired number of dies 4 or plug having a lateral profile that is curvilinear or is like a circle arc, or is differently shaped , and spaced apart according to the distance between the sin gle multiple mold cavities upon which they act, and having their outer surface provided with special embossing projec tions 15 or recesses. Of course, the size of each die 14 is not greater than the size of the bottom wall of a tray V to be embossed. The thus formed embossing devices are urged with a suitable pressure against the molds, and are rotated in the direction opposite to the mold carrying drum in the rotary hot molding machine, at such a speed that each die will act upon the bottom of one cavity of the multiple mold, 4 , and that the peripheral speed of the embossing die and the speed of the bottom wall of a tray to be embossed, con tained in the mold cavity, be the same or sensibly the same at the contact area, the whole in such a manner that the dies will rotate with no slippage in the mold cavities, to pressure emboss the bottom walls of the trays during the hot molding step.
