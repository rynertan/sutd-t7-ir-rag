# CIRCULAR BLADE STRUCTURE FOR OSSEOUS IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUES

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a circular blade structure for osseous implantation techniques, which comprises a redu ced thickness cylindrical hollow body 2 . That body 2 is opened at the bottom thereof and, at the top thereof, is closed by a top member 3 meeting with the side surface of the cylindrical body 2 . From the mentioned top member 3 a stub extends up wardly 6 , effective to allow for a dental prosthesis to be applied. Alternatively, in the same top member 3 a central through hole 31 may be formed, effective to receive a screw member 32 provided with a shaped head 33 . The side surface 4 of the cylindrical body 2 may be housed in a cylindrical crown seat, having such a shape mating that of the side surface 4 , and which is formed on the maxil lary bone, in such a way that a bone portion is located at the inner face of the top member, in order to prevent the blade from sinking in the sponge tissue.
