## Description
The invention relates to a novel telephone switching system and to a novel public telephone instrument by means of which it is possible to make lc g distance calls without cash and the charges for such calls can be determined at the exchange office. These telephone instruments are intended to be able to replace existing coin telephones. The proposed telephone switching system is intended to make iit possible to provide portable telephone instruments which can be plugged into telephone Junction boxes, and with which local or longdistance calls can be made under the control of the telephone company or post office. The proposed telephone switching system and telephone instruments are intended to expand the telephone network and make it less expensive, and to reduce personnel and maintenance.They are also intended to reduce, or even eliminate, unauthorized use of, abus of, and damage to, public telephone instruments, and to substantially increase the revenues from the telephone system. The proposed novel telephone switching system, and novel telephone instruments, are characterized in that the telephone exchange is provided with switching means, so that the access to one or more line connections to the exchange is barred, according to a certain code, with switching means, and one or more register devices are connected to the line connections, and the novel public telephone instruments are equipped with pulse generators, such that a subscriber may be called, without the use of coins and with out the aid of an Operator in the following manner, that, firstly, by setting in motion the pulse generator of the telephone instrument, a code known only to the caller gives access within the exchange to a certain line connection, after which the connection to the subscriber is made, as heretofore, by means of a pulse generator, and that the register device which is connected to the line connection registers the callers S code and the time or time unit of the call. It has hitherto been customary for a person wising to call someone from a public coin telephone to pay for the call immediately by inserting coins There are at present coin telephones which can be used only by inserting coins and coin telephones which can be used by inserting coins and with operator assistance. In the case of coin telephones which can be operated only by inserting coins, the disadvantage is that the caller must have a large supply of coins, and this is not usually the case. It is often impossible for the caller to complete his call because he has no more loose change. In the case of coin telephones which can be operated by inserting coins and with operator assistance, there are other disadvantages, since call are made as follows at the operator s request, the caller inserts enough money for the first three minutes insertion of the coins producing audio signals which enable the operator to check the amount paid.A line to the exchange is then made available by the operator, and the caller obtains the desired connection by dialling.The duration of the call is monitored by the operator. Unless additional coins are inserted after three minutes, the connections is broken. If a person has a telephone in his home or at the office, he may make a long distance call from a coin telephone, assist ted by the operator, and may have the call charged to his home or office number. The equipment outlined above, and the method of making calls, are cumbersome and have disadvantages. In order to accept the coins when a call is completed, or return them to the caller when a call is not completed, requires highly complex equipment, including coin checkers, coin ducts, contacts, relays and receptacles for the coins accepted, to be incorporated into the instrument. This make the instruments expensive and less reliable, and such coin telephone are susceptible to thieves, burglars and vagrants, all attracted by the money in the coin boxes. Counterfeithers are always attempting to use counterfeit coins, circular washers, or less valuable coins of other currencies, to operate coin telephones. A large staff is required for maintenance purposes and to empty the coin boxes. Operator assisted calls from coin telephones often lead to fraud, in that the caller charges the call to some other subscriber, since it is impossible to check his identity. In order to overcome these disadvantages, a novel telephone switching system, and novel public telephone instruments are proposed, whereby it will be possible to make local and longdistance calls without cash and without operator assistance with the call being charged automatically by the telephone exchange. The proposed system is based on the following principle one or more line connections are arranged in the exchange and the passage of one or more telephone lines which lead to the line connections, are barred, with switching means according to a certain code. The customer who has received a certain code from the telephone company or the post office can, with a pulse generator which is integrated into the novel public telephone instrument and with the aid of his code, pass through the code barrier within the exchange to reach the line connection. Then he can, as heretofore, make any local or long distance calls he desires. Because the line connections is be controlled by a register device, his code and call will be recorded automatically.If the customer has a line connection at his home or at his office which is connected to the exchange, one will be able to compose the code in such a manner that the customer with the novel public telephone instrument will be able to telephone by way of his own line connection. In this case, the register device is superfluous, because his line connection is controlled by a charge indicator. In the case of a customer who makes a telephone call by means of his line connection at home or at his office, each novel public telephone instrument within the environs of the exchange, is an extension of the customer s main line. If the customer wishes to telephone his home using the system, then he must additionnally pre program his code in the exchange, to lead to a line connection available to everybody instead of his own line. This enable him to reach his home line. Of course, this could not be done from an extension. The existing switching system in use 1n the telephone exchanges may be used, with appropriate switching, both for coding the access to a connection and for dialling a telephone number. With the proposed switching system, the coin devices become superfluous. The complete control system will be placed in the exchange where the general public has no access. Since it is impossible to obtain the connection without knowing the code, the proposed invention makes it possible to set up simple connecting points in the form of jack sockets and to provide portable telephone instruments which could be used only by persons having code programmed in the exchange. Such connecting points could be mounted on posts cemented into the ground, the sockets being connected to the lines running from the exchange. This would result in inexpensive telephone connecting points which could be used by persons having their own telephone instruments, through the line connection in the exchange. Such telephone connection posts could be set up in parking lots, comfort stations, on autoroutes and the like. It is also proposed that private factory produced telephone instruments could be incorporated into vehicles of all kinds. For example, this would allow a businessman to convert his car into an office with a telephone, when required, at any spot where a socket is located. The telephone cable could be wound on a drum. By inserting the jack into the telephone connecting socket, he could telephone comfortably from his seat in the car. Sockets could also be installed in walls. All of this would substantially expand the company or post office telephone system. Much frequented connection posts could be fitted with telephone instruments of simple design. Since such instruments would contain no coins, Seak ins would be unlikely. Attempts by persons having no line connection at the exchange to use their own instruments for making calls would fail, since they would not know the code leading to a line connection. The codes, according to the proposed invention, will be highly complicated and nobody would be likely to guess them. These codes could be transmitted by means of dials or keyboards using numbers or letters. They might also be composed with the dials or keyboards carrying the digits 1 to 9 and zero already existing on telephone instruments. In this case it would be necesarry to use more than ten digit numbers and these could provide billions of combinations. It would be advantageous to provide a new type of identity card using geometrical figures and other symbols which could be used as codes. Such cards could be introduced into an additional cassette, made for that purpose, into the telephone instrument, and could be scanned, line by line, with a photoelectric cell or electron beam. The pulses transmitted by the novel telephone instrument to the memory in the computer installed within the exchange would release the path to line connection. The code on identity card would, of course, first be pre programmed into the computer memory. It would also be possible to use identity cards fitted with magnetic tapes or small records carrying the code1 in which case the line connection would be reached by electromagnetic oscillations, through the preprogrammed code in the exchange, the said oscillations being transmitted through appropriate devices incorporated into the telephone instrument. Instead of geometrical figures or other symbol, the fingerprint from a specific finger could be used as the code, since it is known that no two persons have identical fingerprints. It would also be possible to use the tip of a specific finger directly as the code, in which case an optical device would be incorporated into the telephone instrument.The fingertip would be inserted into the device and projected onto a small screen. As described hereinbefore, the projected image of the fingertip would be scanned by a photoeletric cell or an electron beam and the pulses transmitted to the exchange would release the customer s line cennec tion. An image of the fingertip would be already preprogrammed in the computer. It would be advantageous to provide a telephone instrument with which calls could be made by means of the proposed code, but also with coin insertion. An instrument of this kind would be of great value to anyone who has not his coded identity card with him for example, one has left his coded identity card at home, or has momentarily forgotten the code word, or for persons having no coded line connection in the exchange. In this case, the telephone instrument would have to be connected to the exchange with two pairs of lines and be provided with a switch. In one position, the said switch would connect the lines leading to the code switching system in the exchange in the other position it would free the lines running through the coin device to the exchange.It is also proposed that there be provided a stationary telephone instrument which is provided with aX board having the digits through 9 and 0 and a socket for receiving another impulse generator. It is further proposed that an impulse generator in a seperate housing, having a jack designed to fit in the socket, would be carried by customer s, and when they desire to make a call, they would merely insert the jack in the socket. Thus, only authorized customer s would be able to dial the telephone instrument so that tampering, or trying to find Åa code, by unauthorized persons would be prevented. The proposed novel telephone switching system, and the proposed novel connecting points and telephone instru ments, would provide considerable advantages for the users and the telephone company or post office. Workmen, employees, or representatives, who frequently have occasion to communicate with their office, would be better able to do so. Travellers wishing to communicate with their families or acquaintances would be able to call the person in question from widely distributed connecting points. It would be easy to summon help in the event of car breakdowns and Great advantages are foreseen for the telephone company or the post office from the proposed invention The proposed public telephone instrument will be of simple construction and, therefore, it will be much less expensive than the present coin telephone. Because there are no coin devices, breakdowns due to coins or coin devices will be eliminated and the maintenance, in general, will be greatly reduced. Because the posts will be of simple construction and will not be equipped with a telephone apparatus, it will be possible to extend the telephone network at minimal cost. Becauseof many advantages to the customer from the new invention, many people will purchase the portable telephone, thus increasing the telephone company or post office revenues. Because the telephone network will be extended and broadened and the customers will be able to place telephone calls without the aid of coins or an operator, people will be encouraged to make many more calls, and the telephone company or post office revenues will, therefore, be correspondingly increased. The objekt of the invention is illustrated in the drawings attached hereto, wherein Fig. 1 is a wiring diagram showing the principle of the novel telephone switching system Fig. 2 is a simplified flow chart of a program to control the computer of figure 1 Fig. 3 shows a wiring diagram of another example of and 3a the novel switching system Fig. 4 shows a telephone instrument having, in addition to the usual numbers, a dial com prising the 26 letters of the alphabet Fig. 5 shows a telephone instrument having two dials, Fig. 6 shows a telephone instrument having a keyboard bearing the usual numbers and a second key board with 24 letters of the alphabet arranged in four rows Fig. 7 shows the same telephone instrument as in Fig. 6 but with. the 24 letters arranged in three rows Fig. 8 shows a telephone instrument having g keyboard for the numbers from 1 to 9 and zero, and a socket for a keyboard with letters, or some other pulse generator Fig. 9 shows a keyboard in a seperate housing, with 24 letters Fi . 10 shows a table telephone of known design con nected to a keyboard to dial a code Fig. 11 shows a telephone instrument in which the code is controlled by means of an identity card Fig. 12 is a section along the line A A in Fig. 11 Fig. 13 is a section along the line B S in Fig. 11 Fig. 14 shows an identity card with a code in the form of a star Fig. 15 shows an identity card with a code in the form of a fingerprint Fig. 16 shows an identity card with a code in the form of a finrint Fig. 17 shows an identity cazdwith a small record Fig. 18 shows an electronic device by means of which the code is controlled through the finger print Fig. 19 shows a portable telephone instrument Fig. 20 shows a telephone instrument with which calls may be made by inserting coins or by using a code Fig. 21 shows g telephone post with a jack socket Fig. 22 shows a vehicle having a telephone instru ment Fig. 23 shows the instrument panel with telephone instrument Fig. 1 illustrates that between the novel telephone instruments A B C D is a part of the switching system arranged in the form of a computer c . In the memory of this computer is preprogrammed the code of each customer who can make telephone calls with the novel telephone instrument. Attached to this computer is a register device 2 that records the customer s code and the calls made. The computer may even have the register device integrated into it. The computer serves as the screen or barrier to block the calls from persons who have not been authorized to use a private code by the telephone company or the post office, from reaching line connection 1 . Only owners of a private code or authorized persons are able, with the aid of a pulse generator integrated into the novel telephone instrument, to arrive at line connection 1 .After the connection to the line connection 1 , the caller can, with the illustrated novel telephone instruments A B C BR D , reach the desired subscriber in the heretofore usual manner. Other callers can also with other codes, make calls, using the same line connection 1 . The register device records the customers code and the call. After a certain time, the customer receives a bill for these calls. When a customer desires to place a call from area I, for example, whose exchange is not connected to his residence or office telephone, he must approach the telephone company or post office in area X to ask that his code be preprogrammed into the exchange of area X. When thg is done, the customer can then telephone anywhere he desires to from area X. The bill for these calls made in area X will be sent to his address from area X or one could also have calls in various areas sent or recorded to the customer 8 exchange, and then he would receive one bill for all such calls. As well known in the art, the memory of the computer would store all authorized codes. When a code is inserted in the computer, the computer will compare the code with authorized codes tored in memory. A simplified flow chart of a program to control the computer is shown in Figure 2.A more elegant program would first determine if the inserted code is in the realm of possible codes. Fig. 3 illustrates a diagram of another example of the novel switching system. Here is shown a step by step switching system acting as a screen or barrier to block unauthorized persons from arriving at line connection 1 . The difference between this step by step switching system and the known switching system lies in that it does not operate on a decimal system, but operates on the alphabet system with 24 letters. The letters Q and Z are omitted.In this case, the customer possesses a line connection in the exchange. This line connection 1 can be identical with the line connection at the customer s home or office.Because it is controlled by a charge indicator, the customer s code will not be registered. The switching system function as follows When the telephone instrument A is plugged in to socket a , the linefinder seeks a free line. If the code word which initially connects the customer to his connection I in the exchange is, for example, SESAM, he begins by selecting the letter S with the dial or keyboard equipped with the letters of the alphabet. When the letter S is dialled, the first selector seeks the level S when the letter E is dialled, the second selector seeks the level E when the letter S is selected, the third selector Seeks the level S. Then, when the letter A is dialled, connector A is brought to its corresponding position and finally, when the letter M is dialled, the connector M is brought to its corresponding position.The customer thus reachs his line connection 1 . He then selects the desired telephone number in the usual way, using the dial or keyboard equipped with digits. The customer may also carry out the same procedure from telephone instruments or connecting points B and C . Fig. 4 illustrates a telephone instrument having a dial 3 equipped with the usual digits 1 to 9 and zero pu s the 26 letters of the alphabet. When letter A is dialled, 11 pulses are produced when letter B is dialled 12 pulses are produced, and so on. With 26 letters, therefore, billions of combinations can be composed. It would scarcely be possible to break a code consisting of a plurality of letters. Fig. 5 illustrates a telephone instrument having two dials, one dial 4 carrying the usual digits 1 to 9 and zero, and the other dial 5 carrying the 26 letters of the alphabet. The letter dial is used to compose the code and the number dial to compose the subscriber number to be called. Fig. 6 illustrates a telephone instrument having a keyboard 6 carrying the usual digits 1 to 9 and zero and a keyboard 7 carrying 24 letters of the alphabet in four rows. The letter keyboard, is used to compose the code and the digit keyboard, to compose the subscriber number. Fig. 7 illustrates a telephone instrument as in Fig. 6 and having two keyboards, the difference being that in this case the letter keyboard is arranged in three rows. Fig. 8 illustrates a telephone instrument having a keyboard with the usual digits 1 to 9 and zero and a socket 8 for a keyboard with letters, or some other pulse generator. The customer may carry the second keyboard on his person and, in case of necessity, he may plug it into the telephone instrument and compose first of all, the code and then the telephone number to be called. Fig. 9 illustrates a keyboard 9 accommodated in a housing and equipped with a jack 10 . This keyboard may be connected to the telephone instrument illustrated inFig. 8. Fig. 10 illustrates a table telephone 11 of known design which is connected to a keyboard 12 carrying 26 letters. The letter keyboard is used first of all to compose the code, after which the telephone number is selected. Fig. 11 to 13 illustrate a telephone instrument in which the code is controlled by means of an identity card 14 which is inserted into a slot 13 , thus actuating a microswitch 15 . The identity card which carries a code 17 , is scanned line by line by an optical or electronic device 16 , and the resulting pulses are fed to the exchange. If the code agrees with a preprogrammed code, the lines to the customer s line connection are freed. Fig. 14 shows an identity card with a code in the form of a fingerprint 18 Fig. 15 shows an identity card in the form of a star 17 with a letter in the middle Fig. 16 shows an identity card with a magnetic tape 19 Fig. 17 shows an identity card with a small record 20 . Fig. 18 illustrates an electronic device which controls the code by means of the fingerprint. This device consists of a housing 21 having a finger guide 22 , an episcope projector 23 , and a mechanism 24 , equipped with a photoelectric cell or electron beam, by means of which the projected fingerprint can be scanned. The finger 25 is inserted into the guide 22 . Located at the top of the guide is a window 26 through which the fingertip 27 may be projected onto the screen 28 . The episcope projector consists of an optical system 29 , a mirror 30 and light sources 31 , and the device is equipped with a microswitch 32 . When the finger is inserted into the guide lever 33 switches on sources of light 31 and sets the device in operation. After the fingerprint is verified and a line opened, a subscriber is dialled in the usual manner. Fig. 19 illustrates a portable telephone instrument equipped with two keyboards which may be plugged in with a jack 34 into connecting points connected to the exchange. The letter keyboard 35 is used to compose the code first of all, after which the digit keyboard 36 is used to compose the telephone number to be called. Fig. 20 illustrates a telephone instrument with which calls can be made not only by inserting coins, buth also by using a code. This instrument is connected to the exchange by two pairs of lines, one pair of lines being for the cQin telephone and one pair for the code. Switch 37 enables the customer to select the desired line, If he selects theCOIN position, he can insert coins into the slot 38 and can then dial the subscriber in the usual manner with the keyboard 39 . If he poccesses a line connection at the exchange, he can set the switch to CODE, dial his code with the first keyboard 40 , and then dial the subscriber with the second keyboard 39 . Fig. 21 illustrates a connection box 42 fitted to a post 41 , which is held in the ground by means of a cement cylinder 43 . The line 44 from the exchange is connected to the socket which is protected from the elements by a small housing. A plate 46 is mounted on the housing, upon which a portable telephone instrument may be placed. Fig. 22 illustrates diagrammatically a vehicle in which a telephone instrument 47 is arranged, preferably incorporated into the dashboard. A line 48 runs from the telephone instrument to a drum 49 , p y ferably accomodated in the trunk, upon which the telephone line is wound. When the vehicle. has been parked in the vicinity of a telephone post 50 , the end of this line, which is fitted with a jack, may be inserted into the socket in the connection box. The said vehicle is thus converted into a telephone box in which the caller may be seated comfortably while making his calls. Fig. 23 illustrates the dashboard of a vehicle with telephone instrument 51 incorporated. The receiver 52 i s pressed into a clamp 53 and is thus securely held while the vehicle is in motion. The switching system according to the inv Z ion can also be used with coin operated machines in general. Instead of the coin device which enables the machine to be set in motion, one can provide a switching system and a pulse generator, which release a code to produce the same effect. A register device can also record the entering code, as well as the transaction involving the service, wares, accomodations or similar. This can lead to cashless service thus replacing coin operated machines.
