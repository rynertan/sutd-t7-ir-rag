# MEMORY BASED DIGITAL WORD SEQUENCE RECOGNIZER

## Abstract
A circuit for detecting the presence of a digital information word sequence within a stream of digital information words comprises a memory 34, 36 which is subdivided into memory levels A₆ A₉ , each memory level having a plurality of memory locations A₀ A₅ . In a preferred embodiment, each memory level corresponds to the position of a word in the word sequence and the memory locations store a recognition status word corres ponding to the bit pattern or patterns sought to be detected. The memory architecture of the present invention facilitates the detection of long sequences of digital words with the use of relatively few memory devices.
