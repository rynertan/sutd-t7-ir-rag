# Timer drive mechanism.

## Abstract
The timing cam 10 is advanced for switching pur poses by a first reciprocating pawl 28 acting on ratchet teeth 30 molded on the timing cam 10 . When the program requires a timed period during which conditions remain the same, the ratchet teeth 30 are spaced so that the pawl 28 cannot pick up the next tooth until the cam is advanced by a second smaller pawl 54 acting on a separate ratchet 56 provided with small, closely spaced teeth. This separate ratchet 58 has a pinion gear 62 driving a ring gear 64 molded inside the timing cam. The steps imparted to the timing cam by the small pawl and ratchet are very small and consume appreciable time the lenght of time taken to position the next tooth for engagement by the large pawl being determined by the space between the large teeth.
