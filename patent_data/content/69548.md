# Data record with pre recorded transducer positioning signals, and system for utilizing same.

## Abstract
A recording member for digital data, particularly a recording tape 10 , has a plurality of generally parallel, closely spaced recording tracks I VII which each contain pre recorded track identifying and transducer positioning servo information, as well as defined data recording areas 18 . The pre recorded track identifying information 32, 34 preferably comprises a digitally encoded individual track address, and the servo information 36, 38 comprises separate bursts used in centring the transducer upon a particular track. Preferably, each such track has a dedicated area 14, 16 at its beginning, end, or both, which contains continuous repetitions of such positioning information, there being no data areas in such dedicated portions. Digital encoding of track addresses utilizes binary type code format, accomplished by defining a binary zero as a recorded burst present at a first number of sampling points, and defining a binary one as a burst present at a second number of sampling points of a second duration. The pre recorded positioning information includes certain non recorded gaps x which serve as initializing signals, and the preferred system for utilizing the pre recorded, servo controlled record member utilizes peak detection and mini mum threshold techniques to accurately distinguish un recorded gaps from noise, or the like, on the one hand, and to distinguish coded signal bursts from other possible recorded signals, or noise, on the other hand. The preferred system is entirely self clocking, i.e., the record member does not carry a recorded clock track, and thus does not require the additional transducer required where recorded clock tracks are used at the same time, the area on the record member otherwise occupied by the clock track is available for data recording usage.
