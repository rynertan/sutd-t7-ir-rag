# SPIN DRYER WITH PLASTIC DRUM

## Abstract
The invention relates to a rotary washing drying or tumbling machine and particularly to a spin dryer of the type in which an electric motor drives a spinning drum. The spinning drum 22 is in two cup shaped portions 39 and 40 joined at flanges 44 and 42 by spin friction welding. The upper portion 39 of the drum has apertures 43 through which water can flow to the ouiside of the drum. Portion 49 has at its upper end a balance ring 47 of dense metal or very dense plastic which is attached to the upper drum portion 39 by plastic rivets. The lower portion 40 of the drum is attached to a mounting 21 which is then directly attached to a motor shaft. The two flanges 44 and 42 have cooperating projecting ring and groove features to enable the two drum portions to be brought together and held in precise location during the spin friction welding operation. The preferred material for the drum is polypropylene.
