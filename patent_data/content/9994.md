# Roller assembly.

## Abstract
A roller assembly includes a body 10 with a cylindri cal bore 12 and rollers 14 extending lengthwise inside the bore. The rollers abut one another to form a closed cir cle of rollers. A folded spring 18 extends diametrically across the circle of rollers with diametrically opposite ends 20,22 pressing between two adjoining rollers to wedge these rol lers apart circumferentially and thus to press all the rollers against the surface 16 of the bore 12 in a keystoning effect with sufficient force to prevent axial movement of the rollers and to radially retain the rollers in the body. The spring is arranged to be subsequently pushed axially from the body.
