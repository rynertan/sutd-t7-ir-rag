## Description
This invention relates to a semiconductor laser which has diffraction gratings therein allowing the selection of a wavelength. More particularly, it relates to a GaInAsP InP distributed feedback semiconductor laser which is useful as a light source in optical communication systems. Since GaInAsP InP double heterostructure semiconductor lasers having an InP substrate attain laser oscillation at a wavelength ranging from 1.0 to 1.6 µm, they are useful as a light source in optical communication systems incorporating optical fibers. Especially, distributed feedback semiconductor lasers DFB lasers which have a diffraction grating with a periodic corrugation on or near the active region attain laser oscillation operation at a single wavelength even when the oscillation wavelength is being modulated, and accordingly they are optimal as a light source for future optical communication systems. DFB lasers are fabricated as follows As shown in Figure 2 A , on the surface of an n InP substrate 1 , a diffraction grating 2 is formed, first. Then, on the side of the diffraction grating 2 of the InP substrate 1, an n GaInAsP optical guiding layer 3, a GaInAsP active layer 4, a p InP cladding layer 5 and a p GaInAsP cap layer 6 are successively grown by liquid phase epitaxy, resulting in the DFB semiconductor laser having a double heterostructure multi layered crystal for laser oscillation as shown in Figure 2 B . The bandgap energy of the optical guiding layer 3 is greater than that of the active layer 4, so that light can be propagated into a region extending from the active layer 4 to the optical guiding layer 3. On the other hand, carriers injected into the semiconductor laser are confined within the active layer 4. That is, the above mentioned DFB semiconductor laser has a so called SCH separate confinement heterostructure structure. This DFB semiconductor laser is disadvantageous in that the Fabry Pérot resonator which is constituted by both facets resulting from the cleavage of the wafer produced by the above mentioned process, achieves laser oscillation not only in the DFB mode but also in the F P mode so that the laser oscillation becomes unstable. In order to prevent laser oscillation in the F P mode, one of the facets is slanted in the resonance direction by means of a slanting means. Moreover, the above mentioned DFB semiconductor laser is disadvantageous in that even though the sloped facet is formed to prevent the reflection of light therefrom to thereby suppress the laser oscillation in the F P mode, there is a possibility of laser oscillation in two DFB modes depending upon the reflectivity of the other facet and the phase of laser light therefrom since the other facet has an influence on the DFB mode. The threshold gain α of laser oscillation in the DFB mode with the reflection of light from the other facet of the resonator is represented as follows Figure 3 shows the dependence of αL on βL which are obtainable from the above mentioned equations. Given that K is 40 cm ¹ and L is 500 µm, KL is 2.0 and these two modes have the same threshold gain on both sides of the Bragg wavelength, resulting in laser oscillation in the two modes, the spectra of which is shown in Figure 4, indicating that when laser oscillation is achieved in the two modes, laser oscillation in a single longitudinal mode cannot be attained notwithstanding that the purpose of use of such a DFB laser is to obtain laser oscillation in a single longitudinal mode. As mentioned above, depending upon the combination of the reflectivity of a facet of DFB lasers, the phase of laser light therefrom and the coupling coefficient thereof, DFB lasers do not oscillate in a single longitudinal mode. It is known from DE A 2537093 that the two diffraction gratings of a semiconductor laser can have different pitches for producing two output laser beams having different wavelengths. The semiconductor laser of this invention which overcomes the above discussed and numerous other disadvantages and deficiencies of the prior art, comprises a triple layered structure composed of an active layer for laser oscillation and a pair of optical guiding layers sandwiching said active layer therebetween, wherein the refractive index of each of said optical guiding layers is smaller than that of said active layer, and the bandgap of each of said optical guiding layers is greater than that of said active layer, and moreover diffraction gratings with different pitches are positioned on the outer side of each of said optical guiding layers. The pitches of said diffraction gratings are set such that the oscillation wavelength, which is in a longer wavelength region than the Bragg wavelength corresponding to the pitch of one of said diffraction gratings and at which the minimum threshold gain of laser oscillation can be achieved, is the same as the oscillation wavelength which is in a shorter wavelength region than the Bragg wavelength corresponding to the pitch of the other of said diffraction gratings and at which the minimum threshold gain of laser oscillation can be achieved. Thus, the invention described herein makes possible the object of 1 providing a DFB laser which attains stabilized laser oscillation in a single mode despite the reflectivity of the facets thereof, the phase of laser light therefrom and the coupling coefficient thereof and 2 providing a DFB laser which attains laser oscillation at a well regulated oscillation wavelength. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 A is a cross sectional view showing a DFB laser of this invention Figure 1 B is a graph showing the dependence of αL wherein α is the gain for the beginning of laser oscillation in the DFB mode, and L is the length of the laser device on the wavelength of the DFB laser shown in Figure 1 A , Figures 2 A and 2 B are schematic diagrams showing the fabrication process of a conventional DFB laser, Figure 3 is a graph showing the dependence of αL on βL wherein β is the deviation of a propagation constant from the Bragg wavelength of a conventional DFB laser fabricated by the process shown in Figures 2 A and 2 B and Figure 4 is a graph showing the spectrum characteristics of a conventional DFB laser which oscillates in two modes. The DFB laser of this invention comprises a pair of optical guiding layers sandwiching the active layer for laser oscillation therebetween. On both optical guiding layers, diffraction gratings which are different in the pitch from each other are formed, respectively, resulting in a single oscillation mode in the minimum threshold gain of laser oscillation despite the reflectivity of the facets thereof, the phase of laser light therefrom and the coupling coefficient thereof, so that the resulting DFB laser can attain stabilized laser oscillation in a single mode. Figure 1 A shows a DFB laser of this invention and Figure 1 B shows the dependence of αL on the wavelength of the DFB laser shown in Figure 1 A . The DFB laser is produced as follows On the 011 face of an n InP substrate 11, a diffraction grating 12 with the pitch Λ₁ is formed, first. Then, on the side of the diffraction grating 12 of the substrate 11, an n GaInAsP optical guiding layer 13, a non doped GaInAsP active layer 14 and a p GaInAsP optical guiding layer 15 are successively grown by an epitaxial growth technique, resulting in a triple layered structure in which the active layer 14 for laser oscillation is sandwiched between the n optical guiding layer 13 and the p optical guiding layer 15. Then, a diffraction grating 18 with the pitch Λ₂ wherein Λ₂ Λ₁ is formed on the surface of the p optical guiding layer 15, followed by successively growing a p InP cladding layer 16 and a p GaInAsP cap layer 17 by an epitaxial growth technique, resulting in a wafer having a double heterostructure multi layered crystal for laser oscillation. The composition ratio of the mixed crystal is set in such a manner that the refractive index of each of the optical guiding layers 13 and 15 which sandwich the active layer 14 therebetween becomes smaller than that of the active layer 14, but the bandgap of each of them becomes greater than that of the active layer 14. The reason why the diffraction gratings with different pitches Λ₁ and Λ₂ are formed is as follows Suppose that a DFB laser having only one diffraction grating with the pitch Λ₁ instead of the DFB laser shown in Figure 1 A is produced with a coupling coefficient κ of 40 cm ¹ and a resonance length L of 500 µm, and moreover that the pitch Λ₁ of the diffraction grating is represented by the following equation under the Bragg reflection conditions Moreover, suppose that the quaternary alloy crystal of the active layer 14 is In₀.₆₅Ga₀.₃₅As₀.₇₉P₀.₂₁ so as to allow correspondence to the oscillation wavelength λ When β₁ L 4, λ Therefore, this DFB laser will oscillate at two different wavelengths which are at a distance of 13 Å i.e., λ₁ λ₁ 13 Å from each other. Alternatively, suppose that a DFB laser having only one diffraction grating with the pitch Λ₂ is produced. The values λ₂ and λ₂ which correspond to the above mentioned values λ₁ and λ₁ , respectively are presented as follows On the other hand, the pitches Λ₁ and Λ₂ of the two diffraction gratings of the DFB laser shown in Figure 1 A are set in such a manner that the wavelength λ₁ at the pitch Λ₁ is equal to the wavelength λ₂ at the pitch Λ₂, resulting in the following equation Since Λ₁ and Λ₂ are represented by the following equations, if the values λ When Λ₁ and Λ₂ are obtained in the above mentioned manner, the relationships between β₁L and α L and between β₂L and α L are represented such as those shown in Figure 1 B , wherein the wavelengths corresponding to β₁L and β₂L, respectively, are indicated. The values of β₁L, β₂L and α L are set depending upon each of the diffraction gratings with the pitches Λ₁ and Λ₂. The dependence of α L on the wavelength of the DFB laser shown in Figure 1 A can be assumed to be approximately the average dependence of α L on the wavelength with respect to Λ₁ and Λ₂ shown in Figure 1 B . Thus, in the DFB laser shown in Figure 1 A , it can be seen from Figure 1 B that when λ 1.5509 µm, the minimum threshold gain of laser oscillation is attained and moreover the minimum gain is sufficiently smaller than those of laser oscillation at other wavelengths, resulting in a stabilized single oscillation spectrum. Although the above mentioned example discloses the case in which the reflection of light arises from one of the two facets and the phase of light is π, it is not limited thereto. According to detailed calculations by the inventors, when Λ₁ and Λ₂ are varied to the same extent, the wavelength which provides the minimum gain is unequivocally determined despite the reflectivity of the facets and the phase of the light, so that laser oscillation in a single longitudinal mode can be attained. Moreover, semiconductor laser materials used in this invention are not limited to the GaInAsP InP system, but other materials can be employed. This invention is, of course, applicable to distributed Bragg reflection lasers DBR lasers other than distributed feedback lasers DFB lasers .
