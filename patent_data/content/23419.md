# A method and a device for testing a logic circuit.

## Abstract
In a system for testing a logic circuit 1 which includes a plurality of flip flops associated with a scanning path bet ween scanning in SI and scanning out SO terminals thereof and a combination circuit including logic gates a parallel to series conversion is performed to reduce the time required to perform a test and to reduce the storage capacity of a memory 4 associated with the testing device. In the system, parallel input data is transformed to serial data by a shift register 51 and the serial data is then set into the flip flops of the circuit 1 . Serial output data from the circuit 1 is transformed into parallel data by the shift register 51 so that the data is output in parallel.
