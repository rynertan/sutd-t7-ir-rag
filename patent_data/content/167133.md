# Circumferentially oriented flexure suspension.

## Abstract
A two axis, monolithic, flexure hinge suspension system for an accelerometer or gyroscope has first 14 , second 12 and third 18 cylindrical portions which are slightly axially spaced from each other along a common axis 16 and are connected by pairs of flexible hinges 26, 28, 36, 38 therebetween. Each pair of flexible hinges 26, 28, 36, 38 is mutually perpendicular to another pair of flexible hinges and is also perpendicular to the common axis 16 . Each flexural hinge comprises a pair of flexure leaves 46, 48, 52, 54, 62, 64, 68, 70 extending between adjacent cylindrical portions and joined together at the crossing portions 56, 72 thereof. One of the leaves 52, 46 in the flexure 26 extends downwardly from an arcuate wall 50 of one of the cylindrical portions 18 to an arcuate wall 44 of another cylindrical portion 12 at about a 55 angle to a vertically oriented common axis. The other leaf 48, 54 in the flexure 26 extends upwardly from an arcuate wall portion 50 in the one cylindrical portion 18 to an arcuate wall 44 in the other cylindrical portion 12 at about a 55 angle to the vertically oriented common axis. The leaves 46, 48, 52, 54, 62, 64, 68, 70 are cylindrically mounted to the cylindrical portions such that one of the leaves 48, 54, 64, 68 is in tension and one of the leaves 52, 46, 70, 62 is in compression. The cylindrical mounting eliminates frequency sensitive changes in the flexure leaves which affect G sensitivity drift of the inertially sensitive device.
