## Description
NOVEL COMPOUNDS This invention relates to novel compounds having pharmacological activity, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and to a process for their preparation. Captopril is a known compound having anti hypertensive activity and the formula A EMI1.1 European Patent Publication No. 12 401 describes a class of compounds which also have anti hypertensive activity and which differ from captopril by the replacement of the HSCH2 moiety by a group of formula B EMI1.2 wherein Ra is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted arloweraikyl, arloweralkenyl, heteroarloweralkyl or heteroarloweralkenyl, or arloweralkyl or heteroarloweralkyl substituted on the alkyl position, and Rb is hydrogen or lower alkyl, and R is hydroxy or alkenoxy or alkoxy, aryloxy, or amino c each of which may be optionally substituted. A representative compound disclosed in the EuropeanPatent Publication has formula C EMI2.1 and is referred to as N l S ethoxycarbonyl 3 phenylpropyl L alanyl L proline. It has now been found that certain novel armethyleneoxysubstituted compounds also have anti hypertensive activity. Accordingly, the present invention provides a compound ofEMI2.2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R1 is C15 alkyl optionally substituted by NHR6, wherein R6 is hydrogen or C1 5 alkylcarbonyl or by phenyl or naphthyl optionally substituted by halogen, C1 5 alkyl or C1 5 alkoxy or by dihydrobenzofuran 2 yl, optionally substituted in the benzo moiety by C1 5 alkyl, C1 5 alkoxy, halogen or trifluoromethyl R2 and R5 are the same or different and each is hydroxy, C1 5 alkoxy, C26 alkylcarbonyl or amino optionally substituted by C1 5 alkyl R3 is C1 5 alkyl optionally substituted by the group 1 5 NHR7, wherein R7 is hydrogen, C15 alkyl or C26 alkylcarbonyl andR4 is phenyl optionally substituted by halogen, C1 5 alkoxy, trifluoromethyl or C15 alkyl. Favourably, R1 is C1 5 alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, and iso propyl or C1 5 alkyl such as ethyl, substituted by phenyl or methyl,or propyl, substituted by dihydrobenzofuran 2 yI. Preferably R1 is ethyl, npropyl, phenethyl or n propyl substituted by dihydrobenzofuran 2 yl. Preferred examples of R2 and R5 include hydroxy, methoxy, ethoxy, and n and iso propoxy. Often R5 is hydroxy and R2 is hydroxy or ethoxy. Preferred examples of R3 are unsubstituted C15 alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, n and iso propyl and the amino substituted alkyl groups, CH2 nNH2, wherein n is from 1 to 4 for example 1, 2 or 4. A preferred example for R4 is unsubstituted phenyl. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I include those with bases, such as alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts for example sodium and potassium salts and ammonium salts and those with acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulphate, phosphate, maleate and like salts. There is a group of compounds within formula I wherein R1 is C1 5 alkyl optionally substituted by NHR6 wherein R6 is hydrogen or C26 alkylcarbonyl. From the aforesaid it will be appreciated that a group of compounds of formula I of interest is that of formula II EMI4.1 wherein. R11 is C15 alkyl optionally substituted by phenyl or dihydrobenzofuran 2 yl R2 is C15 alkoxy or 1 1 hydroxy R3 is C1 5 alkyl and R5 is hydroxy. A preferred sub group of compounds within formula 11 is of formula III EMI4.2 wherein R12 is a C15 alkyl group and the remaining variables are as defined in formula it . Favourable values for R12 are as described for relevant R1 under formula I . Preferred values forR12 are ethyl, iso propyl and sec butyl, most preferably ethyl and n propyl. Another preferred sub group of compounds within formula II is of formula IV EMI5.1 wherein R13 is C13 alkyl substituted by phenyl and the remaining variables are as defined in formula II . R13 is preferably phenethyl. Another sub group within formula II is of formula V EMI5.2 wherein R14 is C1 3 alkyl substituted by dihydrobenzofuran 2 yl and the remaining variables are as defined in formula II . Preferred values for R14 are dihydrobenzofuran 2yl methyl and dihydrobenzofuran 2 yl propyl. The compounds of formula I are inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, and thus have antihypertensive activity. They may accordingly be used in the therapy of hypertension in mammals, such as humans. Accordingly, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound of formula I or, in particular of formula II , and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of this invention are most suitably adapted for oral administration although adaption for other modes of administration for example by injection, are also possible. In order to obtain consistency of administration it is preferred that the compositions of this invention are in the form of a unit dose. Suitable unit dose forms include tabiets, capsules, ampoules and powders in sachets.Such unit dose forms aptly contain from 1 to 100 mg of the compound of the invention and more usually from 2 to 75 mg, for example 5 to 50 mg. Such compositions may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day, more usually from 2 to 4 times a day, in a regimen such that the daily dose is from 5 to 200 mg for a 70 kg human adult and preferably from 10 to 100 mg. The compositions of this invention may be formulated in conventional manner, for example in a manner similar to that used for known anti hypertensive agents such as hydrallazine. In addition such compositions may contain further active agents such as other anti hypertensive agents especially ss blocking agents, and diuretics. The invention also provides a method of treatment of hypertension in mammals including humans which method comprises the administration of a compound of formula I or a pharmceutically acceptable salt thereof. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I which process comprises the reduction of a compound of formula VI EMI7.1 wherein R1 to R5 are as defined in formula I . The reduction is carried out in any suitable manner known generally for such reductions. For example sodium cyanoborohydride may be used in a suitable dry solvent, such as ethanol. Alternatively the reaction may be carried out by hydrogenation over one of the conventional catalysts, such as palladium or carbon or platinum or rhodium in a suitable dry solvent for example ethanol. The compounds of formula III which are novel intermediates and represent part of the invention, may in turn be prepared by reactziag a compound of formula VII EMI8.1 with a compound of formula VII I EMI8.2 wherein R1 to R5 are as defined in formula I . The coupling reaction between the compounds of formulae VII and VIII may be carried out by mixing together the reactants in a dry solvent. The two step conversion of the compounds of formulae VII and VIII into the desired compound of formula I or II may preferably be carried out in one operation by producing the imine of formula VI in situ. In such case , a means for removing the water formed as a by product of imine formation should be present, such as molecular sieves.The reduction of the imine and the removel of the water will drive the reaction forward to give the desired product of formula I the actual amount of imine formed at any time being very small. The compounds of formulae VII and VIII are either known compounds of may be prepared by processes analogous to those used for known structurally similar compounds. A modification of the literature method provided by R. Adams and R. E. Rindfusz in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 41, 648 1919 and H. Normant, Ann. Chim. 17, 335 1942 is suitable for the preparation of those compounds of formula VII wherein the dihydrobenzofuran moiety is bonded to the rest of the structure at the 2 position, and Y is bromo and m is 0 and n is 1. This synthesis is shown below schemetically EMI9.1 After the preparation of a compound of formula I as herein described certain variable groups in the compound may then be optionally converted to other groups. By way of example, a compound of formula I , wherein R2 and R5 are both hydroxy, may be esterified in conventional manner to give the corresponding compound of formulla I , wherein R2 and R5 are both alkoxy. The salts of the compounds of formula I and II may be prepared in conventional manner, for example by reacting the compound of formulae I and II with acid or base as appropriate. The compounds of formula I and II have asymmetric centres and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms. This invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates . The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by conventional techniques or any given isomer may be obtained by a stereospecific synthesis. The asymmetric centres indicated by in the part structures EMI10.1 are preferably in the S configuration. The asymmetric centre indicated by I in the pyrrolidino ring above may have an an or ss configuration. However, the configuration is preferred. The asymmetric centre indicated by in the amino acid part structure EMI11.1 may be in the R and or S configuration, preferably in the S configuration or in both configurations together as in a racemic mixture. In addition, when R1 is alkyl substituted by optionally substituted dihydrobenzofuran 2 yl, then there is a fifth asymmetric centre indicated by 11 in the part structure.EMI11.2 The structure may be in the R and or S configuration, preferably in both configurations together as in a racemic mixture.
