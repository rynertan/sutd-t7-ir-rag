# Lamp dimming apparatus.

## Abstract
Dimming control apparatus for a lamp circuit is described. The apparatus comprises diode routing means 10 connect able to an alternating current distribution line and to a lamp cir cuit. An electronic switch 20 for interrupting voltage supply through the diode routing means is controlled by a photocon troller receiver 22 of a photocontroller. An adjustable pulse timer 26 is arranged to operate a photocontroller driver 24 . A delay timer 28 determines a delay between the beginning of each half cycle of the AC source and the onset of operation of the pulse timer 26 , the pulse width of an output of the photocontroller driver being determined by the said delay.
