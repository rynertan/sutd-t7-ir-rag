# FLUID FLOW CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system which is especially useful in controlling fuel gas flow in a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer includes a master fluid flow path and a slave fluid flow path connected to receive fluid from a common source connection. A first valve is connected in the master path for controlling the rate of fluid flow therein. A first orifice device is connected in the master path between the common source connection and the first valve. The slave path includes a pressure responsive fluid flow modulating valve having a control connection to the master path between the first orifice device and the first valve. A sec ond orifice device is connected in the slave path between the common source connection and the flow modulating valve. The flow modulating valve is operable in response to the fluid pressure in the master path as reduced by the first orifice de vice and in response to the fluid pressure in the slave path as reduced by the second orifice device to control the fluid flow through the slave path.
