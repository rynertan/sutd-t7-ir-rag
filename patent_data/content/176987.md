# Method for controlling a yarn storing, feeding and measuring device.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for controlling a yarn storing, feeding and measuring device, having a stationary storage drum, a yarn sensor and at least one yarn stopping device, wherein the method includes the determin ing of the number of pulses which are to be generated by the sensor before actuating the stopping device. The reliability and speed of the device is enhanced by actuating the stopping device with a pre determined delay time after receipt of the pulse, the number of which corresponds to said pre determined number.
