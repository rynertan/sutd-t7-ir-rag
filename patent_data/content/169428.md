# CUTTING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for cutting elongated material into short lengths is provided. The method features the steps of compressing the elongated material at discrete intervals transversely slightly tensioning the elongated material along its length between intervals pressing the slightly tensioned elongated material between intervals against a cutting edge and cutting the elongated material with the cutting edge. The apparatus features a pair of cooperating rolls rotating in opposite directions and between which the elongated material passes. The cutting roll has a plurality of radially extending cutting blades as well as a plurality of radially extending projections, at least one of the projections being located on each side of a cutting blade and extending further radially from the cutting roll than the blades. The second roll is formed of an elastic material and is engaged by the projections in succession to compress the elongated material therebetween.
