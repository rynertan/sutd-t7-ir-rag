# Safety belt guide structure.

## Abstract
A root portion 21 is secured on a base plate 6 and an arm portion 23 extending from the root portion 21 to form a guide space 25 between the arm portion 23 and the base plate 6 for receiving a safety belt 3 . The arm portion 23 has at its free end an inturned tongue 24 turning toward the root portion 21 . The inturned tongue 24 is maintained in contact with the base plate 6 . The belt guide 20 permits entrance of the safety belt 3 into the guide space 25 under a force to cause the inturned tongue 24 to lift off the base plate 6 but prevents the safety belt 3 from lifting the inturned tongue 24 off the base plate 6 to escape from the guide space 25 .
