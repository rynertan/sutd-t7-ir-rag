# Method and Apparatus for Magnetic Recording and Reproducing.

## Abstract
A magnetic recorder reproducer using two rotary heads distributes two channel digital signals A, B into odd sample groups b and even sample groups a for each channel. The odd and the even sample groups of the same channel are written in alternate scanning intervals separated from each other along the direction of scanning S . Thus the effect of burst errors can be reduced.
