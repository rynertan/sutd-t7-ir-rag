## Description
Physiblogically absorbable anastomosis of vessels and canals on human and animals DescriptionThe present invention relates a surgical prosthesis for anastomosis of blood vessels, and canals in general, in humans and animals, which is absorbed physiologically the organism after healing of the connected vessels or canals.Although the present invention has been developed for and is particularly directed toward the field of vascular microsurgery, it may be applied in a more general way to extend to the anastomosis of any canal structure in the organism. Microsurgery has recently developed ever more rapidly, due in part to the progress achieved by the technical aids, such as dioptical enlargement devices, instruments, and bipolar coagulation. Although progress has also been made with regard to the suture materials, sutures ard still performed using traditional methods of applying the stitches, even for blood vessels very small in diameter , on the order of I mm or less.The traditional suture methods are very difficult in the area of microsurgery they are laborious, timeconsuming and moreover do not provide the necessary certainty of achieving the desired aim, that is, the perfect healing of the connection of the blood vessels which were resected, as well as the corrett flow of fluid through the vessel.One aim of the present inyention is to provide a prosthesis for the anastomosis of canals tn general and or microvascular anastomosis in particular, which eliminates the need for suturing the vessels with stitches and uses a prosthesis easy to apply and highly affordable.Another aim of the present invention, in addition to the former is to provide a prosthesis whhii absorbed by the orhanism within a sufficient period of time to allow healing of the connection of the canals, so as to leave no extraneous bodies in the organism. By means of the prosthesis according to the present invention, an end to end prosthesis may be performed, while with a slightly modified prosthesis, an end toside prosthesis may be done.The prosthesis for end to end anastomosis comprises three members a central hollow cylindrical member, and two end members, into edshof which are inserted the two ends of the vessel or canal to be connected, said vessel being turned over the outside of the end members, which are then inserted in the central member until they touch, the central member maintaining the connection and ensuring that the blood or other fluid is sealed inside the vessel.In sum, the prosthesis comprises . a central member cylindrical in shape with a first open longitudinal passage of circular section, as well as longitudinal slits which extend from the end of said central member toward its mid line, so as to form end lips, the inner surface of which has a roughened shape two end members with a second open longitudinal passage of circular section with a diameter which allows the canal to benanastom√èsed to he inserted in said second oassane, where the outer surface of said end members has, starting from one end to the other, a roughened portion which can be fixed with the wall of said first passage of the central member, aPtruncated conical portion which can be fixed with the inner surface of said end lips of the central member, and an enlarged diameter portion which can provide a grip for the operator said anastomosis is performed by inserting the ends of the canals to be connected in the passage of said end members, turning over said ends on the roughened portion and inserting the end nembers from opposite direction in the passage of the central member until they touch.The central member and the end members ard made of a physiologically absorbable copolymer of L lactit acfd and glycolic acid, of formulaEMI4.1 glycolic acid L lactic acid in which X is between I00 and I000, and the ratio m n is between 80 20 and IOO I0 Another object of the present invention is a modification of the prosthesis described above, in which a transverse opening is provided in the central member, to effect a side to end anastomosis.The tnvention will be illustrated with reference to the attached drawinqs, in which figure I is a side view, partially sectioned, of the central memeber figure 2 Is a front view of the central member figure 3 is a side view of an end member figure 4 Is a front view of an end member figure 5 is a variant of the central member for a side to end anastomosis figure 6 is a front view of the member in figure 5 figures 7 and 8 show respectively the side and front of an end member to be used in combination with the central member of figure 5 figure 9 shows the phases in executing end to end anastomosis figute IO shows the prosthesis members prepared for a side to end anastomosis.With reference to figures I and 2, the central member of the prosthesis indicated with I has a hollow cylindrcal shape with a longitudinal passage 2 At the ends of central member I are sZits. 3 between which are formed lips 4 which extend a certain distance from the end. The inner surface of the lips 4 has a roughened shape shown in figure I with circumferential ribbing 5.With reference to figures 3 and 4, the end members of the prosthesis indicated with 6 have a longitudinal passage 7. The outer surface of the end member 6 has a first roughened portion 8, for example saw toothed, a second truncated conical portion 9 and a third portion IO with a wider diameter. With reference to figures I to 4 and to figure 9, where a indicates the relative position which the central member I and end members 6 must assume, the vessel or canal to be connected, indicated with II, is inserted in the passage 7 of the end member 6 starting from portion 10 until it extends a certain distance in frontnof portion 8. The extending section is turned over and placed over the roughened portion 8, as shown in figure 9 b . The end member 6 is then inserted in passage 2 of the central member I until it holds the truncated portion 9 against the inner roughened surface of the lips 4.The roughened portions 8 of the end members 6 are fixed against the surface of the longitudinal passage 2 of the central member, thus fixing in position the two ends of the vessel to be anastomised inside the central member I. Said ends are then placed in contact with one another, in correspondence with the mid line of the central member I, to allow their healing and connection, as shown in figure 9 c .In this way, it is clear how inside the central member I the blood vessel forms a continuum, ensuring the flow of the biological fluid inside it.The above description shows how the anastomosis operation is extremely rapid and reliable with res pect to the previous techniaue of suturing the ends of the vessel with stitches. The advantage of the present invention is particularly striking in microsurgery, since the prosthesis allows and end to end anostomosis only a few millimeters in diameter to be performed In a few minutes by taking advantage of the physiologicaT healing, which with usual techiques even in expert hands requires much longer times and does not always allow secure canalization of the treated vessels. In fact, usual techniques can give rinse to complications like stenosis, thrombosis, etc., which are completely absent with application of the prosthesis according to the invention.The healing process occurs thanks to the particular geometry of the prosthesis which allows the two ends of the vessel to be held intimately together.The central member allows the ends to be held in place thanks to the anchoring effect arising from the particular working of the inner surface coupled with the considerable elasticity of the copolymer.Thanks to their particular desigh, the end parts allow the immediate turning over of the vessel, which at the same time is held by the notches formed by the saw tooth shape on portion 8.The size proportions were devised above all as a function of the absorption by the organism in a period of time ranging from 60 to 90 days after the operation.Figures 5 to 8 and 10 show a variant for side to end microvascular prosthesis.As shown in figure 5, the central member of the prosthesis indicated with I2, has in correspondence with its mid line an opening I3 going into a transverse cylindrical conduit I4 with substantially the same characteristics of slits and lips I5 described above for the central member I of figure 1. The conduit 14 is designed to receive a side member I6 with the same characteristics as terminal member 6 illustrated in figures 3 and 4 and which has the same functions, except that its diameter is smaller.The terminal members I7 figures 7 and 8 for the side to end prosthesis have the same characteristics as the end members 6 previously illustrated in figures 3 and 4, with the difference that in correspndence with the front end of the inner passage I8 there is a bevelling 19 so that, once the end members I7 are inserted in the central member I2, a hollow space may be created between the ends of the vessels held by the end members I7 and the end of the vessels held by the side member I6. In this way, the connection is made by healing the vessels in an end to end position with that in a lateral position.Since the geometry of the members of the prosthesis in this case require precise orientation of the end members I7 with respect to the central member I2, an alignment notch 20 is provided the central member I2 in a position opposite opening I3, as well as alignment notches 21 on the end members IJ, in a position opposite bevelling I9.Figure 10 shows the members of the side to end prosthesis in position for the connection to be made.The side to end microvascular prosthesis thus serves to connect vessels of various di ameter.To appreciate the import of the present invention, it must be considered that its. utility is directed particularly to microsurgery. As an example for end to end prosthesis, the central member may have a length of approximately 5.5 mm and a diameter of 3.0 mm, while the terminal members have a length of 4 mm and a diameter of 3 mm in the widened portion which serves as the surgeon s grip, with a diameter of only 1 for the inner passage. As an example, the prosthesis for side to end anastomosis may have a side member with the above mentioned dimensions for a I mm vessel, end members with a 3 mm inner passage , and conseguent proportions of the central member.However the prosthesis according to the invention is not limited to microsurgery, even if this is the field where it is most advantageous, but may be used in all types of vascular surgery, transplants and organ surgery.The end to end prosthesis has already been applied experimentally in the following types of operation kidney transplants, testes transplant, porto renal anastomosis, liver transplant, arterial and venal transplant, microsurgery of the sedimentary branches of the renal artery, etc.The side to end prosthesis has already been applied experimentally in the side to end homolateral spermatic large saphena anastomosis for the correction of varicocele, and may be applied in all vascular situations requiring side to end anastomosis when the vessels to be sutured are of different diameters , thus greatly reducing execution times or allowinn a stable connection of the treated vesselsWith regard to the material of which the prosthesis is made, as mentioned above, it consists of a L lactic and glycolic acid in the proportions indicated. This is a non toxic material which is biodegraded in the organism within 60 90 days. The purity of the material must be very high, and is determined by differential calorimetric scanning. The chemical composition of the preparation is checked by IR and PMR spectral analysis. The copolymer is prepared by known methods.
