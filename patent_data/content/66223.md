# Fuel control method for gas turbine.

## Abstract
A fuel control method for a gas turbine 3 based on a digital computer. A control system for fuel control, an acceleration control system 11 , an exhaust gas temperature control system 12 , a speed governor control system 10 , and a start up control system 9 are graded in the preference order of fuel control. When a negative feedback signal exceeds a target value in the respective control systems, the fuel control signal is selected in accordance with the grading of the preference order. Of the four control systems, the acceleration and exhaust gas temperature control systems are set to be of the first grade of the preference order and are subjected to an override fuel control preferentially to the other control systems. The acceleration preset value during the acceleration control is determined by values limiting the difference between the speed preset value and the actual speed, the acceleration preset value begins to decrease when the actual speed reaches a value predetermined relative to a target speed, and the acceleration preset value is decreased to zero when the actual speed reaches the target speed, thus performing fuel control.
