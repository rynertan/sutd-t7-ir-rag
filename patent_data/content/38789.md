# Method and arrangement on extracting, reeling up, pulling in, ect., of a heavy cable or similar.

## Abstract
On extracting, reeling up, pulling in etc., of a heavy cable 7 a main frame 10 that can be set up or that may already be present on a vehicle 1,2 may be used, the said main frame comprising a base unit 10a made up of a number of beams, and two bearing brackets 10b projecting upwards from its long sides. A drum for the said cable is supported free to rotate on the bearing brackets. The drum 11 is provided with drive gear 13 which comprises a motor unit and a transmis sion component 14 . Pulling device 17 is connected to a core of the cable and to a pull free mechanism 16 secured to the main frame. By means of the pull free mechanism the cable 7 can be given a small longitudinal displacement which enables the cable to be pulled free of its duct 6 . After pulling free the pulling device is disconnected and the said core is pulled up towards and anchored on the drum, after which the motor unit is operated to turn the drum. The major part of the longitudinal displacement of the cable is then achieved by reeling the cable directly up on to the drum 11 .
