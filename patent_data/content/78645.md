# Peristaltic pump tube assembly.

## Abstract
A tube assembly 24 for a peristaltic pumping system is described. The assembly 24 includes resilient inner and outer tubes 42 and 44 of which the inner tube 42 has a lumen 46 along which liquid can be pumped by occluding the tube 42 and causing the point of occlusion to progress along a length of the tube defining a pumping zone 48 . The outer tube 44 fits closely around the inner tube 42 and extends over said zone 48 . The tubes 42 and 44 are free of attachment to one another over at least a substantial part of said zone 48 so that the contacting surfaces of the respective tubes 42 and 44 define an interface along which relative movement between the tubes 42 and 44 can occur during pumping. The tubes 42 and 44 are secured together at at least one point 50 or 52 along their lengths. It has been found that abrasion of the innermost surfaces of the inner tube 42 is minimized and that reduced contamination of the liquid being pumped and increased pump tube life can be expected as compared with conventional peristaltic pump tubes.
