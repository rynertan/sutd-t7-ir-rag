# Method for drilling deviated wellbores.

## Abstract
Directional drilling of a high angle wellbore is carried out by the drilling of a vertical first portion 3 to a kick off point 7 at which a high angle, deviated second portion 9 is initiated. The wellbore is cased to at least below the kick off point. A casing liner 31 is lowered through the wellbore so that it extends coexten sively with the casing 13 . The liner is spaced from the casing by a casing hanger 32 positioned above the kick off point. The liner is sealed in the casing and prevented from rotating during drilling by a packer bore receptacle 35 positioned between the lower end of the liner and the casing. During the drilling of the deviated second portion of the wellbore, the casing liner protects the casing from wear due to the rotation of the drill string 17 as it lies on the lower side of the high angle wellbore.
