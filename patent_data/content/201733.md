# BIT LINE DRIVER

## Abstract
In a bit line driver for MOS memory, units of a microcomputer, which is connected between a pair of complementary bit lines 22, 23 and provided with an equalizing MOS transistor 55 , a pair of active load MOS transistors 53, 54 and a pair of clamping MOS transistors 51, 52 are connected separately to the complementary bit lines 22, 23 , and further the area of the clamping MOS transistors 51, 52 is determined to be about three times greater than that of the active load transistors 53, 54 . An increase in the area of the clamping MOS transistors 51, 52 serves to decrease the internal resistance thereof, so that the clamping operation can be improved. A decrease in area of the active load MOS transistor 53, 54 serves to increase the internal resistance, so that the access time can be improved. In addition, the driver can operate stably in response to a low power clock pulse.
