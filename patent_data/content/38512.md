## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION a Field of the Invention This invention relates to complexes useful as carriers for pharmaceutical and cosmetic active materials. The compositions permit continued constant rate transdermal penetration of active materials, that is, through the cell membranes of skin and the gastrointestinal nucosa. b State of the Art Permeation of pharmaceutical and cosmetic active substances through body tissues when administered topically or orally is essential for effective treatment. Carrier materials for the active subst ces optimally should effect or permit penetration at a steady rate. Moreover, the carrier materials should not alter the cell membrane systems of the tissues or the proteins therein responsible for biochemical functions, such as substance transport. Many surfactants or other strongly ionic materials which are used as penetration adjuvants, emulsifiers, wetting agents or the like in pharmaceuti cal or cosmetic compositions, as well as some strongly ionic active materials, alter the cell membrane, as by denaturing the membrane proteins, dissolving the lipid layer of the membrane or otherwise adversely affecting the membrane transport system. As a result, substance penetration is impeded or stopped and effective treatment is no longer achieved or excessively high doses are required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. It has now been discovered that these problems can be overcome and relatively steady and unhindered permeation of active materials through body tissues can be achieved by inclusion of the active material in a complex amphoteric compound. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to amphoteric dissociating complexes which are useful as transder mal carriers or pharmaceutical active ingredients0 The complexes have a cationic group having the structure orEMI3.1 wherein R1 is an aliphatic alkyl group having 6 to 22 carbons, R2 is a member of the group consisting ofR4 CH2 CH2 COOH, R4 CH CH COOH and OPO3H2, wherein R4 is NH , NH CO , or 0 CO , and R3 is hydrogen, CH2 COOH or CH2 CH2 COOH and an anionic group which is either a carboxylate having the formula OOC CH2 O CH2 CH2 x OCnH2n 1 or a phosphate having the formula OEPO CH2 CH2 OCH2 CH2 x OCnH2n 1 wherein n is 8 to 22 and x is 1 to 10 and z is 1 when the anionic radical is a carboxylate and z is 2 when the anionic radical is a phosphat. The complexes enhance permeation through skin membranes of active pharmaceutical or cosmetic ingredients incorporated therein. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides carriers for active pharmadeutical and cosmetic ingredients. The carriers are amphoteric dissociating complexes which are metabolized in a manner whereby substantially unhindered permeation through cell membranes is achieved. The amphoteric dissociating complexes of the invention have a cationic group of the formula orEMI5.1 wherein R1 is an aliphatic alkyl group having 6 to 22 carbons, R2 is a member of the group consisting of R4 CH2 CH2 COOH, R4 CH CH COOH and OPO3H2 wherein R4 is NH , NH CO , or O CO , and R3 is hydrogen, CH2 COOH or CH2 CH2 COOH and an anionic group which is either a carboxylate having the formula OOC CH2 O CH2 CH2 x OCnH2n 1 or a phosphate having the formula O3PO CH2 CH2 OCH2 CH2 x OCnH2n 1 wherein n is 8 to 22 and x is 1 to 10 and z is 1 when the anionic radical is a carboxylate and z is 2 when the anionic radical is a phosphate.Also included within the scope of the invention are the alkali metal salts, such as potassium and sodium salt formed with the carboxylate or phosphate groups of the cationic group. Preferred complexes of the invention are those having the above cationic imidazoline group, wherein R1 is C12H25 or, less preferably, the alkyl residues of capryl, cocoyl, oleyl, palmitoyl, stearyl or behenyl fatty acids, R2 is NH CH2 CH2COOH or, less preferably, one of the above other groups and R3 is CH2 CH2 COOH or, less preferably, one of the other defined groups, complexed with the above carboxylate anionic groups wherein x is 5 and n is 12. The complexes of the invention may be prepared by treating alkali metal salts of an imidazoline with a carboxylic or phosphoric acid in aqueous solution, said reactants having structures corresponding to those defined above for the cationic and anionic radicals. Stoichiometric amounts of the reactants may simply be stirred at 20 80 C, preferably 400 C for about 15 minutes, to form the complex. Complex formation has been verified by high voltage electrophoresis and column chromatography. Ring closure of imidazoline reactants necessary to form of the complexes of the invention may be effected by reacting an appropriate carboxylic acid with an appropriate di or triamine according to the following exemplary reaction sequence EMI7.1 wherein R5 is an hydroxyl, chloride or amino group and R1 is as defined above. The resulting ring compound may then be reacted with CH2 CH2 COOH or chloracetic acid at 1200 C for 4 hours to provide the corresponding R3 substituent. The R2 substituents may be incorporated into the compounds 1 by dissolving the ring material in a solvent, such as chloroform or methylene chloride, and adding with stirring at room temperature acrylic acid or a suitable anhydride 2 by dissolving the ring material in aqueous solution and reacting with an appropriate amino acid at 50 80 C for one hour, or 3 by stirring the ring material into polyphosphoric acid at 600 C for 1 hour. Where R3 is hydrogen, the open ring reactants used to form the cationic group of the complexes of the invention can be formed by hydrolysis of the imidazoline compounds in, aqueous solution at pH 9 for two hours at 66fO C. Where R3 is not hydrogen the ring is hydrolyzed prior to substitution at the R3 posy done The anion reactants are available commercially or may be formed by conventional techniques. Active cosmetic or pharmaceutical ingredients can be incorporated into the complexes of the invention to thereby facilitate transport of the active through tissue membranes Where the active material itself can exist as an ionic radical of the type which can react to form a salt with the complex of the invention, incorporation can be achieved by simply reacting the active material with the complex. For example, a carboxylate active ingredient could be reacted with a complex having a cationic group in sodium salt form. Active materials which do not contain ionic groups suitable for salt formation can be incorporated into the complexes of the invention by covalent bonding to one or the other complex substituent. Active materials can also be incorporated into the complexes of the invention by micellar inclusion or secondary bonding, i.e., Van der Walls forces and electrostatic interaction. The substituents of the cationic portion of the complexes of the invention are those which are metabolized into physiologically acceptable materials.This is believed to account, in part, for the suitability of these materials for skin transport vehicles. It is further postulated that the complexes of the invention are effective cell membrane transport vehicles due to their amphoteric resemblance to lipids and membrane proteins responsible for substance transport.Moreover the complexes appear to have relatively little or at least delayed denaturing effects on the membrane proteins and do not appear to change the protein configuration or solubilize the lipid layer of the cell membranes. It is believed that the complexes of the invention have minimal adverse effects on cell metabo lism and, more specifically, the membrane transport system necessary therefor, due to these characteristics Where an active ingredient is strongly ionic or itself contains substituents which produce adverse effects on cell membranes, it may be rendered physiologically more compatible and transport thereof can be further enhanced by reacting the active with glutamic acid, aspartic acid, lysine or arginine to form a salt in addition to combining the active with a complex of the invention. Such salts mask the physiologically adverse effects of the active ingredient.Further, where high levels of active must be administered, nicotinic acid or acetylsalicylate may be reacted to form salts or complexes with the imidazoline or active material. Such salts produce hyperaemia in ducing salts may also be employed0 The complexes along with effective amounts of the active ingredients are formulated as a bath, cream or other composition for topical application or into a composition for oral administration. Such formulations generally are aqueous based.In addition to the water base, carrier complex and active ingredient, other materials commonly employed in topical or oral pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions may be included in the formulations O For example, presehr vatives, antimicrobials, foaming agents or the like can be employed. Surfactants, particularly sulfate surfactants, which inhibit membrane transport, should be avoided. The following examples are illustrative of the invention.EXAMPLE 1 A preferred formulation for use in application of active ingredients in a bath contains a complex having the structureEMI10.1 This complex is preferably applied in a composition containing Complex 15 parts Cocofattyacid diglycolamide 3 parts Stearyl alcohol decaoxethylate 9 parts Isopropanol 5 parts 4 Hydroxybenzoicacidmethylester 0.2 parts 4 Hydroxybenzoicacidpropylester 0.1 part and sufficient active ingredient and water to bring the total composition to 1 00 parts.EXAMPLE 2 A preferred complex for use in a cream formulation has the structure EMI11.1 In addition, the cream preferably contains a salt of nicotinic acid and the imidazene group of the complex employed in Example 1 to induce hypanemia in the skin to which the cream is applied.
