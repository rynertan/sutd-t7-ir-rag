## Description
A NOVEL TUMOUR ASSOCIATED ANTIGEN The present invention relates to the characterization of antigens, particularly tumor associated antigens. In another aspect, it relates to antibodies having specific reactivity with such antigens. In yet another aspect, it relates to methods for producing such antibodies as well as diagnostic and therapeutic uses therefor. The potential role of monoclonal antibodies in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in humans has been the focus of much recent investigation and speculation. Of particular interest are their use in immunoassays to monitor the course of disease, e.g., during therapy. Also, of particular interest are the potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for tumor imaging and therapy due to their capacity to bind to tumor associated antigens in vivo. Developments in monoclonal antibody technology have also made it possible to investigate the antigenic complexity of human tumors. Specifically, the precise immunoreactivity of monoclonal antibodies permits the identification and differentiation of cell surface antigens expressed by human tumors. The characterization, therefore, of such distinct tumor associated antigens provides a means to more fully exploit the use of monoclonal antibodies for cancer diagnosis and therapy and to maximize the advances of monoclonal antibody technology. To date, only a limited number of tumor associated antigens are well characterized. Additionally, certain tumor associated antigens useful as diagnostic or prognostic markers may not be present in all patients or during all stages and manifestations of the disease. Accordingly, there exists a need for further identification and characterization of unique tumor associated antigens. The present invention is predicated upon the discovery and characterization of a novel antigen present in human tissue, particularly normal colon and colon carcinoma.Accordingly, the invention is directed to a distinct tumorassociated antigen, characterized by its reactivity with monoclonal antibody YCRO10. In accordance with the present invention, antibodies having specificity for the antigen defined herein and methods for the production of such antibodies are provided.Additionally, the invention is directed to the use of such antibodies for the in vitro detection and diagnosis of cancer by immunohistochemical and immunoassay methods. The invention is further directed to the use of such antibodies for the in vivo diagnosis and treatment of cancer in humans. As indicated above, the present invention provides a novel tumor associated antigen. In accordance with the invention, monoclonal antibody YCRO10, generated by hybrid cell line ATCC Deposit XHB8787, is utilized for characterization of this previously undescribed antigen. The physiochemical and immunological properties of the antigen of the present invention, and particularly, its reactivity with monoclonal antibody YCRO10, permit its characterization and differentiation from other antigens present in normal tissue and tumor tissue. Accordingly, the identifying characteristics and properties of the antigen provided by the present invention are as follows a The antigen is a membrane component of normal co lon tissue and the mucosa of colon carcinoma. Standard ELISA procedures enzyme linked immunoab sorbent binding assay using monoclonal antibody YCR0l0 indicate the presence of the antigen in plasma membranes purified from human colon tissue and the mucosa of colon carcinoma. By comparison, YCRO10 exhibits no appreciable reactivity with mem branes purified from such other benign tissues as liver, kidney, prostate, bladder, brain and pan creas.b Standard immunohistochemical procedures demonstrate the presence of the antigen in benign colon and colon carcinoma as a strong reactivity with YCRO10 is shown by immunoperoxidase staining of such tissue. A weak reactivity or no reactivity is shown with other benign tissues, including pro state, lung, liver, kidney, pituitary, skin and breast.c SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis reveal that the an tigen has a molecular weight in the range of about 36,000 to about 39,000. Modification of the an tigen by treatment with proteinase K and by treat ment with sodium periodate prior to SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis destroys the anti gen s reactivity with YCR0l0, indicating the anti gen is glycoprotein in nature.d The antigen is an O linked glycoprotein. Mild alkali treatment of the antigen and treatment of the antigen with N glycanase confirms the glyco protein nature of the antigen and demonstrates that the antigen is an O linked glycoprotein.e Isoelectric focusing of the antigen using a stan dard flat bed isoelectric focusing technique indi cates an isoelectric point within the range of about 5.1 to about 5.4. Summarizing the foregoing, the antigen of the present invention, which may be derived from a source selected from normal human tissue or human tumor tissue, is characterized as an O linked glycoprotein having a molecular weight within the range of about 36,000 to about 39,000 and having an isoelectric point within the range of about 5.1 to about 5.4.Further, the tumor associated glycoprotein of the present invention is expressed by normal colon and colon carcinoma. Of particular importance in distinguishing the antigen of the present invention from other antigens, including other tumor associated antigens, is the specificity of monoclonal antibody YCROl0 for at least one determinant of the antigen characterized herein. Additionally, the specific reactivity of YCR0l0 for the antigen defined by the invention provides a means for isolation and purification of the antigen from other material of human origin, and ultimately characterization of antigenic determinants. Such a purified antigen and determinants thereof are useful in the production of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic application using techniques well known in the art. For example, murine hybridomas producing monoclonal antibodies may be obtained.In other cases, tne antigen may be used to stimulate an immune response in a rabbit, goat, or other animal from whose serum polyclonal antibodies may be obtained. In addition, the antigen may be used for the characterization of antibodies of interest, e.g., monoclonal antibodies, or antibodies present in human tissue, blood, or other body fluids. In accordance with the present invention, monoclonal antibodies having specificity for the antigen characterized herein, and methods for their production, are provided.Preferably, such monoclonal antibodies are of the IgG class and possess an immunoreactivity with the tumour acociated glycoprotein of the present invention substantially similar to that of monoclonal antibody YCR0l0. Such monoclonal antibodies are useful in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer in humans, particularly colorectal carcinoma. Further, such antibodies have application in the further isolation and purification of the antigen provided by the invention and the characterization of precise determinants. Monoclonal antibodies as described above may be produced generally following the method of Kohler and Milstein,Nature, 256, 495 497 1975 . In accordance with the present invention, a mouse or other suitable host is immunized with the purified antigen of the invention or a m3irane fraction of huEn tumour tissue derived from a colon carcino. Following immunization, tne spleen cells of tne immunized mouse are fused with the cells from a suitable mouse myeloma line to obtain a mixture of hybrid cell lines.The hybrid cell lines are cultured in a suitable medium, and thereafter, those hybrid cell lines producing an antibody having specific reactivity with the antigen characterized herein are selected and cloned, and the antibody produced is recovered. The present invention suggests methods for the in vitro detection and diagnosis of cancer in humans, especially colorectal carcinoma. Characterization of the unique tumor associated glyprotein of the invention as set forth herein permits its detection in patient tissue samples by immunohistochemical methods and or in patient fluid samples by in vitro immunoassay methods. A determination of the presence and or quantity of the tumor associated antigen of the present invention in patient specimens by immunohistochemical and or immunoassay procedures is of diagnostic utility and may be indicative of, or correlate with, the progression of the disease state. Immunohistochemical methods for the detection of antigens in patient tissue specimens are well known to the art and need not be described in detail. Briefly, in the context of the present invention, a tissue specimen obtained from a suspected cancer patient is contacted with an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, having specificity for the tumor associated glycoprotein characterized herein. Particularly preferred for use is monoclonal antibody YCRO10.The sites at which the antibody is bound is thereafter determined by selective staining of the tissue specimen by immunohistochemical procedures. Similarly, methods for the in vitro detection of antigenic substances in patient fluid samples by immunoassay procedures are well known to the art and require no repetition. For purposes of the present invention, a patient fluid sample is contacted with at least one antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, having specific reactivity with the tumor associated glycoprotein of the invention and the antibody bound to sample components is determined.Qualitative and or quantitative dotereninations of the presence of the antigen defined by the invention may be accomplished by competitive or non competitive immunoassay procedures. Monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies may be suitably utilized provided such antibodies possess the requisite specificity for the antigen provided by the present invention. Preferably, onoclonal antibody YCRO10 is utilized. Additionally, the immunoassays preferred for use are two site immunometric assays employing monoclonal antibodies which are selected to bind to non interfering determinants of the antigen characterized herein. The present invention further suggests methods for the in vivo diagnosis and therapy of cancer, particularly colorectal carcinoma. Methods for tumor localization and detection may be performed, in accordance with the present invention, by administering to a suspected cancer patient a predetermined effective amount of an antibody having specific reactivity with the tumor associated glycoprotein of the present invention and detecting the sites of localization of the antibody by standard imaging techniques. The antibody, preferably YCROl9, is administered to the patient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and labeled preferably with a radionuclide emitting gamma radiation, so as to permit detection. In accordance with methods permitted by the present invention for cancer therapy, a predetermined effective amount of an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, having specificity for the tumor associated antigen characterized by the invention is administered to a cancer patient. The antibody, preferably YCRO10, is administered to the cancer patient in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and conjugated with a suitable therapeutic agent, e.g., radioisotopes, preferably emitters of beta particles, drugs, toxins or biological proteins, selected for delivery to the tumor site. Additionally, in the context of in vivo cancer diagnosis and therapy, those skilled in the art will appreciate that antibody preparations comprising mixtures of antibodies or fragments thereof having specificity for the tumor associated antigen of the invention may be used in certain instances to enhance the detection, localization and treatment of tumors. The present invention may be better understood by reference to the following non limiting example. EXAMPLE I Production of Monoclonal Antibody YCROlO Lymph node lymphocytes obtained from a patient with colon carcinoma were thawed and cultured overnight inRPMl 1640 Flow Laboratories, Alexandria, VA containing 10 fetal bovine serum PBS . 30 x 106 lymphocytes and 30 x 106 of P3 HT, a subline of P3x63Ag8.653 were fused with 358 polyethylene glycol 1000 in serum free RPMI 7.5 dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells were plated out at densities of 105 total cells per well in 96 well plates Costar, Cambridge, MA in EPMI lOZ FBS HAT 104M hypoxanthine, 4 x 10 7m ami ç srin w and 1.6 x l05M thymidine . Cultures were maintained for 2 weeks in 58 C02 and thereafter supernatant was replaced with fresh HAT media once per week.Supernatant from wells with growing cultures were sampled at day 40 and tested for the presence of Ig by enzyme linked irmnunoabsorbent binding assay ELISA . Ig producing clones were then screened by ELISA for specific reactivity with membranes and cytosols from colon tumors. The monoclonal antibody designated as YCROlO was characterized further and selected for use in the characterization of the antigen as provided herein. EXAMPLE II Antigen Characterization Monoclonal antibody YCROlO was used to characterize the antigen of the present invention by the procedures set forth herein. Membrane and cytosol fractions of human tissue were utilized for antigen characterization, as well as for screening the reactivity of monoclonal antibody YCROlO and prepared as follows Surgical and autopsy specimens collected within ten hours after death were cut into blocks and stored at SO0C. Tissue was homogenized in four volumes of lOmM tris HCl pH7.5, 2mM calcium chloride, 2mM phenylmethylsulfonate homogenization buffer at 40C in a Dounce homogenizer. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 . The homogenate was centrifuged at lOOxg for 5 minutes to remove nuclei and intact cells. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 130,000xg for one hour. The supernatant from this high speed centrifugation was removed and designated as the cytosol fraction. The pellet was resuspended in one volume of homogenization buffer and layered on a 408 208 discontinuous sucrose gradient in l0mM tris HCl pH7.2. The gradient was centrifuged at 130,000xg for 17 hours.Material at the 40 20 interphase was pipetted off, and diluted 5 fold in homogenization buffer and centrifuged for 60 minutes at 2S,000xg. The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer, aliquoted and stored at 800C. Membrane Cytosol ELISA The presence of antigen reactive with monoclonal antibody YCRl0l in purified membrane and cytosol fractions of normal human tissue and human tumor tissue was determined by an enzyme linked immunoabsorbent binding assay ELISA as measured by absorbance at 490 nm. To perform the membrane cytosol ELISA, 10pg well of cytosol or 2ug well of membrane, prepared as described above, was dried onto flat bottom microtiter plates Dynatech,Alexandria, VA at 370C overnight. The plates were washed three times with cold tap water. 50ul of 20t horse serum inPBS phosphate buffered saline, 0.15M Nail, 20mM sodium phosphate pH7.2 was added followed by 50ul of hybridoma supernatant and incubated for one hour at room temperature.After washing, the wells were incubated with 100ul of a monoclonal mouse anti human IgM HRP conjugate 2All, conjugated by the method of Wilson L Nakane, 1978 diluted 1 1000 in 5t horse serum PBS for one hour. Bound enzyme was detected by incubation with l00ul of lug ml o phenylenediamine, 0.03 H202 in 0.lM citrate phosphate buffer pHS.0, for 30 minutes in the dark. Wells were quenched by the addition of SOul per well of NH4 504. Absorbance at 490nm was read in a Dynatech ELISA plate reader. As shown by Table I below, YCR0l0 was reactive with membrane fractions of mucin colon carcinoma and normal colon, indicating the presence of the antigen of the invention in mucin colon carcinoma and normal colon membranes. YCR0l0 was unreactive with membrane fractions of other tissues including normal lung, liver, prostate, bladder, brain and pancreas.Immunohistochemical Determination The presence of antigen reactive with YCR0l0 in normal human tissue and human tumor tissue was determined by immunoperoxidase staining of human tissue. Sections of frozen tissue blocks, obtained from surgical and autopsy specimens collected within ten hours after death and stored at 60C were cut 4 6 micron sections on the microtome cryostat. The sections, mounted on glass slides, were briefly air dried and then dipped in acetone.An indirect immunoperoxidase assay, essentially as described by Taylor, Arch. Pathos. Lab. Med., 102, 13 1978 , was used to stain these slides. Sections were rehydrated by incubating in phosphate buffered saline PBS for 5 minutes. YCROl0 antibody was overlayed onto the sections and incubated in a humid chamber for one hour. Antibody was washed off the sections with PBS and the sections were then immersed in PBS for 5 minutes. The sections were overlayed with a 1 50 dilution of peroxidase conjugated goat anti human IgM antibody Tago Chemicals, Burlingame, CA and incubated for 30 minutes in a humid chamber. Antibody was washed off withPBS. The color reaction was developed with lmg ml of diaminobenzidine and 0.038 H2O2. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin easin. Table II below indicates that YCRO10 had a positive reactivity with normal colon and colon carcinoma, as measured by the intensity of the staining of tissue, and a weak or no reactivity with other tissues, including normal prostate, lung, liver, kidney, pituitary, skin and breast.Biochemical Analysis of Antigen The protein nature and molecular weight of the antigen characterized by YCR0l0 were determined by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS PAGE , Western immunoblot analysis, and immunostaining. 259 of colon membrane proteins were dissolved in gel sample buffer 0.125M Tris pH6.8, 4 SDS, 20 glycerol, 0.0028 bromophenol blue, 5 2 mercaptoethanol and separated by discontinuous SDS PAGE Laemmli, 1970 on a 7,58 or 10 gel with a 3 stacking gel. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose 0.1um, Schleicher Schuellt At 200mA for 3 hours according to the method of Towdin et al 76 4350 1979 . The nitrocellulose replicas were then incubated with 3 bovine serum albumin BSA PBS for 30 minutes, after which they were incubated with hybridoma supernatant diluted 1 1 with 5 skim milk 0.00 thimerosal 0.lt anti foam A emulsion SigmaChemical Co., St. Louis, MO overnight, in sealed pouches.The nitrocellulose strips were washed with PBS 0.1 Tween for 30 minutes with 5 changes of buffer, and incubated with l251 labeled goat anti human IgM Tago, Burlingame, CA , 500,000cpm ml skim milk reagent, for 2 hours. After washing with PBS 0.l Tween, the nitrocellulose strips were air dried and exposed on X ray film Kodak XAR 5 for 18 72 hours with intensifying screen Cronex DuPont Lightning Plus at 700. To further determine the nature of the antigen, membranes prepared as described above were subjected to the following treatments prior to SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis. a Methanol the membrane suspension was incubated with 5 volumes of methanol for one hour at 40, microfuged, and the precipitate washed twice with ethanol. The preci pitate was dissovled in gel sample buffer for SDS PAGE.b Sodium periodate membranes were incubated in 2OmM sodium periodate for one hour at 40. c Neuraminidase the membrane suspension was adjusted to pH5 6 with acetic acid and incubated for one hour at 370 with l0mU of neuraminidase 160 un units mg., ts mg . Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO . d Proteinase K the membrane suspension was incubated with l.25mg ml of proteinase K 20 units mg., Boehringer Mannheim for one hour at 370. All reactions were stopped by adding gel sample buffer. By SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis the molecular weight of the antigen was determined to be within the range of about 36,000 to about 39,000. Chemical and enzyme modification of the antigen followed by SDS PAGE and and Western immunoblot analysis demonstrated the glycoprotein nature of the antigen. Specifically, reactivity of the antigen with YCR0l0 was shown to be destructible by treatment of the antigen with proteinase K as well as sodium periodate as described above. The loss of reactivity of the antigen withYCR0l0 did not result from the alternative modifications described above. Determination of O Linked Glycoprotein The nature of the antigen was further characterized to be an O linked glycoprotein by mild alkali and N glycanase treatment.Mild Alkali Treatment Membranes were treated with 0.lN NaOH overnight at room temperature, dialyzed with PBS and airfuged at 100,000xg for 30 minutes. The pellet was dissolved in gel sample buffer for SDS PAGE and western immunoblot. The supernatant was spotted and dried on nitrocellulose and immunostained as inWestern blot analysis.N Glycanase treatment 25ag membrane proteins was boiled in the presence of 0.5t SDS 0.lM B mercaptoethanol, diluted with an equal volume of O.2M sodium phosphate pH8.6 l0mM EDTA lZ NP40 and incubated with l unit of N glycanase 260 units ml., Genzyme Corporation, Boston, MA overnight at 30 . The sample was dissolved in gel sample buffer for SDS PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis. Isoelectric Focusing Isoelectric focusing of the antigen characterized by YCRO10 was determined using a standard flat bed isoelic tric focusing technique on polyacrylamide gel as described below. Membranes were extracted in 6M urea O.St N40 O.05 SDS by sonication Heat Systems, Ultrasonics, Inc, model W 375 and subjected to horizontal isoelectric focusing Multiphor II, LKB on PAGplates pH3.5 9.5 LKB for 1 1 4 hours at 5 , at the suggested power settings of 30W, 50mA and 1500V.After focusing the separated proteins were passively transferred to nitrocellulose in Tris buffered saline TBS, 0.02MTris O.1SM NaCl pH8.0 overnight, immunostained and visualized as in Western blot analysis. Isoelectric focusing of the antigen by this technique revealed its isoelectric point to be within the range of about 5.1 to about 5.4.
