The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of the Z isomer, the E isomer or a mixture of the E and Z isomer. It will be appreciated that oxidation of compounds of formula I wherein Z is S may lead to a number of optically active isomers, and accordingly the present invention includes such isomers and mixtures thereof. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of the invention include those in a form adapted for oral, topical or parenteral use and may be used for the treatment of the infection in mammals including humans. Suitable forms of the compositions of this invention include tablets, capsules, creams, syrups, suspensions, solutions, reconstitutable powders and sterile forms suitable for injection or infusion.Such compositions may contain conventional pharmaceutically acceptable materials such as diluents, binders, colours, flavours, preservatives, disintegrant and the like in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice in the manner well understood by those skilled in the art of formulating antibiotics. Injectable or infusable compositions of a compound of the invention are particularly suitable as high blood levels of the compound can occur after administration by injection or infusion. Thus, one preferred composition aspect of this invention comprises a compound of the invention in sterile form and most suitably in sterile crystalline form. The injectable solution of the compound of this invention may be made up in a sterile pyrogen free liquid such as water, aqueous ethanol or the like. An alternative approach to administering the compounds of this invention is to utilise an injectable suspension. Such suspensions may be made up in sterile water sterile saline or the like and may also contain suspending agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, lecithin or the like Alternatively such compositions may be prepared in an acceptable oil suspending agent such as arachis oil or its equivalent. For use in such suspensions the compounds of this invention should be in the form of fine particles. Unit dose compositions comprising a compound of this invention adapted for oral administration form a further suitable composition aspect of this invention. Unit dose compositions comprising a compound of this invention adapted for topical administration are also presented by this invention. In this instance topical administration also includes local administration to internal surfaces of mammary glands of cattle, for example during the treatment of mastitis by intra mammary administration. The compound of the formula may be present in the composition as sole therapeutic agent or it may be present together with other therapeutic agents such as a penicillin or cephalosporin.Considerable advantages accrue from the inclusion of a penicillin or cephalosporin which shows Instability to ss lactamases since the resulting composition shows enhanced effectiveness synergy . Suitable penicillins cephalosporins or other lactam antibiotic for inclusion in such synergistic compositions include not only those knownto be highly susceptible to ss lactàmases but also those which have a degree of intrinsic resistance to P lactamases. Suitable penicillins for inclusion in the compositions of this invention include benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, carbenicillin, azidocillin, propicillin, ampicillin, amoxycillin, epicillin, ticarcillin, cyclacillin, pirbenicillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, celbenicillin, pipericillin, and other known peni cillins including pro drugs thereof such as their in vivo hydrolysable esters such as the acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxyethyl or phthalidyl esters of ampicillin, benzylpenicillin or amoxycillin, and aldehyde or ketone adducts of penicillins containing a 6 a aminoacetamide side chain such as hetacillin, metampicillin and analogous derivatives of amoxycillin or esters of carbenicillin or ticarcillin such as their phenyl or indanyl esters.

Such compounds are frequently used in the form of a salt or hydrate of the like. Naturally if the penicillin or cephalosporin present in the composition is not suitable for oral administration then the composition will be adapted for parenteral administration. Highly favoured penicillins for use in the compositions of this invention include ampicillin, amoxycillin, carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Such penicillins may be used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt such as the sodium salt. Alternatively the ampicillin or amoxycillin may be used in the form of fine particles of the zwitterionic form generally as ampicillin trihydrate or amoxycillin trihydrate for use in an injectable suspension, for example, in the manner hereinbefore described for a compound of this invention. The preferred penicillin for use in the synergistic composition is amoxycillin, for example as its sodium salt or trihydrate. Particularly suitable cephalosporins for use in the compositions of this invention include cephaloridine and cefazolin which may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt for example the sodium salt. When present together with a cephalosporin or penicillin, the ratio of a compound of the invention to the penicillin or cephal osporin agent may vary over a wide range of ratios, such as from 10 1 to 1 10 for example about 3 1, 2 1, 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 1 5 or 1 6, wt wt, based on pure free antibiotic equivalent . Orally adminstrable compositions containing a compound of the invention will normally contain relatively more synergist than corresponding injectable compositions. The total quantity of a compound of the invention in any unit dosage form will normally be between 25 and 1000 mg and will usually be between 50 and 500 mg, for example about 62.5, 100, 125, 150, 200 or 250 mg. Compositions of this invention may be used for the treatment of infections of inter alia, the respiratory tract, the urinary tract and soft tissues in humans and mastitis in cattle. Normally between 50 and 3000 mg of the compounds of the invention will be administered each day of treatment but more usually between 100 and 1000 mg of the compounds of the invention will be adminstered per day, for example at 1 6 doses, more usually as 2, 3 or 4 doses. However for the treatment of more severe systemic infections or infections of particularly intransigent organisms higher doses may be used in accordance with clinical practice. The penicillin or cephalosporin in the synergistic composition of this invention will normally be present at approximately the amount at which it is conventionally used which will usually be expected to be from about 62.5 to 3000 mg per dose, more usually about 125, 250, 500 or 1000 mg per dose. One particularly favoured composition of this invention will contain from 150 to 1000 mg of amoxycillin as the trihydrate or sodium salt and from 25 to 500 mg of a compound of this invention. A further particularly favoured composition of this invention will contain from 150 to 1000 mg of ampicillin or a pro drug thereof and from 25 to 500 mg of a compound of this invention. Most suitably this form of composition will contain ampicillin trihydrate, ampicillin anhydrate, sodium ampicillin, hetacillin, pivampicillinhydrochloride, bacampicillin hydrochloride, or talampicillin hydrochloride. Most suitably this form of the composition will contain a compound of the formula I when in crystalline form. Most suitably the preceding composition will contain from 200 to 700 mg of the penicillin component. Most suitably the preceding composition will comprise from 50 to 250 mg of a compound of the formula I preferably in crystalline form. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parenteral use except when containing an in vivo hydrolysable ester of ampicillin or amoxycillin in which case the compositions will not be adapted for parenteral administration. Another particularly favoured composition of this invention will contain from 200 to 2000 mg of carbenicillin, ticarcillin or a pro drug thereof and from 50 to 500 mg of a compound of the invention. Suitably this form of composition will contain di sodium carbenicillin. Suitably this form of the composition will contain di sodium ticarcillin. More suitably this form of the composition will contain from 75 to 250 mg of a compound of the formula I preferably in crystalline form. Such compositions containing di salts of carbenicillin and ticarcillin will be adapted for parenteral administration. The present invention also provides a method of treating bacterial infections in humans or domestic mammals which comprises the administration of a composition of this invention. Commonly the infection treated will be due to a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Bacteroides fragilis or the like. The organism believed to be most readily treated by an antibacterially effective amount of a compound of this invention is Staphylococcus aureus. The other organisms named are more readily treated by using a synergistically effective amount of the compound of the invention and a penicillin or cephalosporin. The administration of the two components may take place separately but in general we prefer to use a composition containing both the synergist and the penicillin or cephalosporin. The indications for treatment include respiratory tract and urinary tract infections in humans and mastitis in cattle. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof which process comprises reacting a compound of formula V EMI13.1 wherein Rx is a carboxyl blocking group 1 with compounds R2SH and R3SH wherein R and R3 are as defined with respect to formula I and wherein any reactive groups may be protected or 2 with a compound of formula HS Y SH wherein Y is as defined with respect to formula I and wherein any reactive groups may be protected in the presence of aLewis acid catalyst and thereafter where necessary carrying out one or more of the following steps a oxidising a sulphide to a sulphoxide or sulphone derivative b removing the carboxy blocking group R c removing any protecting groups on Rê or R , or Y and d converting the compound to a free carboxylic acid, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester. It will be appreciated that when R2 and R3 are the same in formula I then compounds R2SH and R3SH will also be the same, and when Rê and R are different in formula I then a mixture of compounds RêSH and and R SH will be used. The starting material of formula V is disclosed in UK Patent No 1 504 426. Suitable carboxyl blocking derivatives for the group CO2Rx in formula V include ester derivatives of the carboxylic acid. The derivative is preferably one which may readily be cleaved at a later stage of the reaction. Suitable ester forming carboxyl blocking groups are those which may be removed under conventional conditions. Such groups for R include benzyl, pmethoxybenzyl, 2,4, 6 trimethylbenzyl, 3,5 di t butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl, benzoylmethyl, p nitrobenzyl, 4pyridylmethyl, 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, 2,2,2 tribromoethyl, allyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl, 2 benzyloxyphenyl, 4 methylthiophenyl, methoxymethyl, a silyl, stannyl or phosphorus containing group, or an in vivo hydrolysable ester radical such as defined above. The carboxylic group or a salt thereof may be regenerated from any of the above esters by usual methods appropriate to the particular R group, for example, base catalysed hydrolysis, or by enzymicallycatalysed hydrolysis, or by hydrogenation. Suitable Lewis acid catalysts include boron trifluoride or its equivalent such as a boron trifluoride etherate, for example BF3.O C2H5 2. The preceding reaction normally takes place in a solvent inert under the reaction conditions such as chloroform, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane or may be carried out using the thiol or dithiol reagent as solvent. The reaction is generally carried out at a depressed or non elevated temperature, for example 800C to 300C, and preferably at a depressed temperature, for example 200C to OOC, and conveniently at about OOC. Those compounds of formula I wherein Z is SO or SO2 can be prepared from the corresponding compound wherein Z is S by mild oxidation. Such reactions may take place at an ambient or depressed temperature, for example at 200C to 0 0 0 20 C, more suitably at 12 C to 5 C, for example at about OOC. The oxidation is best brought about using an organic per acid as the oxidizing agent. Suitable acids include m chloroperbenzoic acid and equivalent reagents. Use of two equivalents of the oxidizing agent leads to a compound of the formula I whereinZ is SO whereas the use of an excess of the oxidising agent leads to a compound of the formula I whereinZ is S02 The use of one equivalent of the oxidising agent leads to compounds wherein only one sulphur has been oxidised to the sulphoxide. It is normal to carry out the oxidation in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride or the like. Acids within formula I may be prepared by the careful acidification of a corresponding salt such as the sodium salt. Salts within formula I may also be prepared by salt exchange in conventional manner, for example a solution of the lithium salt in water may be passed through a bed of ion exchange resin in the sodium form eg Amberlite 120 a sodium salt of a sulphonated polystyrene divinyl benzene co polymer in about ten fold excess until elution is complete the resulting sodium salt may be obtained by freeze drying or the like. Similarly a sodium salt may be converted to a lithium salt or to a potassium salt in similar manner. The following Examples illustrate the invention.
