# Support material for immobilisation of ligands.

## Abstract
It has been a problem to find alternatives to agarose as a support material for affinity chromatography. It has now been found that a polysaccharide having pendant or terminal D galactose residues can, on the one hand, be immobilised and on the other hand activated enzymically by D galactose oxidase to form aldehyde groups, which are then reacted with a primary or secondary amino group of a ligand, for example an immunoglobulin. Immobilisation is by cross linking or by a preceding, partial oxidation of the D galactose residues to link the polysaccharide to a matrix through an amino group, whereby the D galactose residues are used to perform two different functions. The invention includes the support material per se, the polysaccharide, preferably a D galacto D mannan, having pendant or terminal groups of formula G CHâ‚‚ LIG G a D galactose residue, LIG a ligand residue, R H or R and LIG together represent a residue of the same ligand molecule , its preparation and its use in the affinity chroma tography of a binding partner for the ligand.
