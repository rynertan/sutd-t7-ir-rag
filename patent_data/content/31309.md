# Device for rigidly coupling a handle to its corresponding manual implement, and an implement provided with the said device.

## Abstract
The invention comprises a first element 1 that can be connected to a handle 7 , or else be made in one piece therewith, and has a terminal stem 2 , the area of which is less, provided with projections 3 whose surfaces 3b , turned towards the rim 4 defined by it with respect to the body of the first element 1 , slope both with respect to the axis of the first element and to a plane perpendicular to the said axis a second element 8 provided internally with an axial hole 8a , which allows the passage of the first element 1 , and a number of projections 9 equal in number or a multiple of those of the said stem 2 , with lower surfaces 9b shaped to accept flush therewith the sloping surfaces 3b of the projections 3 with which the said stem 2 is provided. The coupling is ensured by a ring nut 6 that can be screwed to the first element 1 and be carried flush up against the upper surface of the body of the instrument to which the second element is secured, and by a locator member 11 11a positioned at the side of at least one of the projections 9 on the second element 8 .
