## Description
This invention relates to a transversal type equalizing method applicable in communication systems or lines and using a control circuit for setting an optimum tap coefficient. Generally, in communication systems, such transmission distortions as an amplitude distortion, a delay distortion or the like are caused owing to imperfectness of devices utilized for communication. For this reason, in order to maintain a stable communication system, a certain type of distortion equalization is necessary. Especially, in a satellite communication system, a high power amplifier is mounted on a satellite. However, since the amplifier is a non linear amplifier, equalization of transmission distortion carried out in either the transmitting apparatus or receiving apparatus is insufficient to maintain a stable communication state, as well known in the art. For this reason, in a communication system including a non linear amplifier, independent equalizers are provided for the transmitting and receiving apparatus to perform independent transmission path equalization before and after the non linear amplifier. As one example of the distortion equalizer may be mentioned a transversal type equalizer. To have better understanding, one example of the construction of a transversal type equalizer, to which the present invention is applicable, will be described with reference to Fig. 1. It comprises a signal input terminal 1, 2N delay circuits 2 each having a predetermined delay time T₀, 2N 1 complex multipliers 3, a signal synthesizer 4 in the form of an adder circuit and an output terminal 5. Complex signals C With this equalizer, it is possible to vary the frequency characteristic without interrupting the signal by varying the tap coefficients C One of the serious problems in the operation of the transversed type equalizer is encountered in selecting respective tap coefficients C Taking a TDMA time division multiple access satellite communication system, for instance, the equalizing characteristic will be as follows In this system, the transmission path bandwidth is about 40Mz so that it is necessary to sufficiently equalize in this range. However, the range of equalization in 30Mz, is 0 to 22.5 ns for the parabolic group delay, 7.5ns for the linear group delay, 1.5dB for the linear amplitude and 1.8dB for the parabolic amplitude. It is not always necessary to provide continous correction within this range, and it is known that even when the residual distortion after equalization is considered, the code error rate of the demodulated signal after the correction by means of the transversal type equalizer can be maintained in a sufficient expected value range if the correction could be made by 0.1dB for the amplitude characteristic, and every 0.5ns or 1ns for the group delay characteristic. In this case, for each tap, 46 words are necessary for the parabolic group delay, 31 words for the linear group delay, 31 words for the linear amplitude, and 37 words for the parabolic amplitude. Where all combinations of respective characteristics are to be equalized, at least 45x30x30x36 1458000 words are necessary, but the limit of the number of memory words now being used is 8K words where a 64K ROM is used. For this reason, the aforementioned system or a so called memory table reference system, in which all of the previously calculated tap coefficients are stored in the memory device and are read out when necessary, is difficult to realize through currently available technique. EP A 0048475 describes a transversal equalizer according to the preamble of claim 1 and updating the tap weight in accordance with the correlation of the unequalized signal and the error signal. The transversal filter of GB A 2034146 comprises A D converters, their conversion period being equal to the tap length of the transversal filter. On the other hand, a further measure may be considered wherein a necessary number of optimum tap coefficients are calculated when desired, but such a measure is also difficult to realize from the standpoint of calculation time and memory size. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a novel transversal type equalizing method capable of quickly setting optimum tap coefficients by making use of the presently available technical level. This object is solved with the features of the claims. This method provides for a fast, highly reliable and inexpensive transversal type equalizer apparatus. In the accompany drawings Fig. 2 shows, in block form, a preferred embodiment of transversal type equalizer apparatus according to this invention. Referring to Fig. 2, the apparatus comprises a control circuit 101, a memory circuit 102, a transversal type equalizer 103a shown in Fig. 1 or 103b shown in Fig. 4 and terminals 104 to 107 for designating equalizing characteristics of which terminal 104 is used to designate a parabolic group delay characteristic, terminal 105 a linear group delay characteristic, terminal 106 a linear amplitude characteristic, and terminal 107 a parabolic amplitude characteristic. With the apparatus shown in Fig. 2, when terminals 104 to 107 are supplied with designations for the desired equalizing characteristics, the control circuit 101 sequentially reads out tap coefficients commensurate with the given equalizing characteristics from the memory circuits 102 and supplies the read out tap coefficients to the transversal type equalizer 103a or 103b. As a consequence, the transversal type equalizer 103a or 103b is controlled in accordance with the supplied tap coefficients to set desired equalizing characteristics. In this case, the tap coefficients to be stored in the memory circuit 102 are determined in a manner as will be described with reference to Fig. 3 which shows one example of a measuring system for determining optimum tap coefficients. The measuring system shown in Fig. 3 is constituted by an equalizing characteristic signal generator 201, the transversal type equalizer 103a or 103b and a transmission path characteristic measuring circuit 202. In this measuring system, the tap coefficients C When two types of characteristics are designated, the control circuit 101 executes the convolution operation of tap coefficients corresponding to respective characteristics read out of the memory circuit 102 to obtain a new tap coefficient. Let us explain this by taking the parabolic group delay and the linear group delay, for instance. The overall transmission characteristic T ω is given by the product of T₁ ω and T₂ ω where T₁ ω represents the transmission characteristic of the parabolic group delay, and T₂ ω that of the linear group delay. It is well known that, along a time axis, an overall impulse response can be obtained from a convolution integration of respective impulse responses. This is indicated by the following equation where h t , h₁ t , h₂ t are inverse Fourier transforms of T ω , T₁ ω and T₂ ω . Equation 2 can be reduced to, where N, M and L are positive intergers. By substituting equation 5 into equation 2 , we obtain By substituting equation 4 into equation 6 , we obtain By substituting equation 3 into equation 7 , we obtain When comparing the coefficients of both sides, we obtain Then, by putting i n m, we obtain provided that C Where three or more types of characteristics are designated, a new tap coefficient is first determined for two types of characteristics and the final tap coefficient is determined in accordance with the new tap coefficient and remaining characteristics. Fig. 4 shows another equalizer to which teachings of this invention is applicable. The equalizer shown comprises n delay circuits 2 each causing a definite time delay, in phase signal synthesizers 11 and 12, a 90 phase shifted signal synthesizer 13, variable attenuators 21 to 20 n and 31 to 30 n , the amounts of attenuation thereof being controlled by tap coefficients C I l to C I n, C R l to C R n respectively, an input terminal 1 and an output terminal 5. With this equalizer, the calculation of equation 1 can be operated by the variable attenuators so as to control the transmission path characteristics. The control circuit 101 which reads out designated tap coefficients from the memory circuit 102 and feeds back the read out tap coefficients to the control elements of the transversal type equalizer 103a or 103b can readily be realized by using a microprocessor CPU or the like utilizing a program. Where such a microprocessor is used, it is possible not only to execute the operation described above, but also to control an alarm display when a designated distortion characteristic exceeds a predetermined range or pass loss and pass delay with programs, thus increasing additional performances. It should be understood that it is not always necessary to determine the tap coefficient by using a measuring system that gives a quasi equalizing characteristic and the tap coefficient can also be determined by a computer simulation equivalent to the measuring system described above. As described above, in the transversal type equalizer apparatus according to this invention, optimum tap coefficients commensurate with the equalizing characteristics are stored in a memory circuit and the tap coefficients are read out of the memory circuit when an equalizing characteristic is given so that the setting can be made readily in a short time. Moreover, as its construction is simple, its reliability is high and it can be manufactured economically. Specifically, when tap coefficients of a plurality of characteristics are read out, the convolution operation of the read out tap coefficient are executed to determine a new tap coefficient. Accordingly, it is possible to effect an optimum equalization in a short time with a memory device having a small capacity, hence simple construction.
