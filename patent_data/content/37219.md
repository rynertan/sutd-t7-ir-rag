# Apparatus for melting and dispensing thermoplastic material.

## Abstract
A fail safe thermostatically controlled circuit is disclosed for use in high throughput thermoplastic material melting and dispensing apparatus including a hopper into which solid thermoplastic material is deposited for feeding the thermoplastic material to a grid melter which melts the thermoplastic material whereupon the molten thermoplastic material flows from the grid meter to a reservoir from which the molten thermoplastic material is pumped to an applica tor or dispenser. Both the grid melter and the reservoir are preferably heated by electrical resistance heaters 33, 41 energized by separate fail safe thermostatically controlled circuits. Each fail safe thermostatically controlled circuit includes a manually adjustable thermostat 35, 43 for sensing the temperature of the molten thermoplastic mate rial in order to connect a high voltage and current power source through a fusible element 64, 64 included in fail safe circuitry to the electrical resistance heaters for energizing the electrical resistance heaters when the temper ature of the molten thermoplastic material is below a preselected thermostat temperature setting. The fail safe circuitry also includes a shut off temperature detector 48, 49 for sensing the temperature of the molten thermoplastic material in order to energize a heat generating element 67, 67 for melting the fusible element if the temperature of the molten thermoplastic material reaches a predetermined shut off temperature which is above the preselected thermo stat temperature setting, thereby disconnecting the power source from the electrical resistance heaters.
