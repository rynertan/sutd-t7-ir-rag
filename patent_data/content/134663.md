# Apparatus for rapid switch conical scan feed.

## Abstract
Apparatus for rapidly starting and stopping a conical scan antenna beam in which a feed 11 rotating about a centerline 29 provides a non conical scan antenna beam during a search mode. When a target is detected, a solenoid 23 moves an actuator pin 19 which displaces one end 13 of the feed from the centerline, thus providing a conical scan antenna beam for target tracking.
