## Abstract
There is an abrupt change in band gap in each of the interface regions 9, 10, 11 and 12 between a series of light absorbing regions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of a monocrystalline semi conductor body. The band gap decreases progressively with distance from the light incident surface of the body and the major part of the change in band gap within each of the interface regions is in the band favouring a particular type of carrier. The interface regions are narrower than the carrier mean free path so as to provide kinetic energy for efficient carrier multiplication with reduced noise as the carriers pass through the semiconductor body.
