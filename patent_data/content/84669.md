# A method for cleaning gas mixtures which might contain dust from a urea plant.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for cleaning gas mixtures which might contain dust from a urea plant, especially off gases from prilling towers or granulation units. In order to prevent precipitation and accretion in the cleaning unit, it is applied an aqueous washing solution to which formaldehyde is added before it is brought in contact with the gas mixture. Formaldehyde is preferably added in the form of formaline and the addition of formaline is re gulated by means of pH measurements in the washing solu tion and its pH is kept at pH 6 8,5. The pH of the washing solution is preferably kept at pH ca. 7, especially in order to obtain optimal removal of ammonia. The method is car ried out during application of standard scrubbers in which aqueous washing solutions can be used.
