# Apparatus for applying a printing or cutting force to a laminated tape.

## Abstract
An apparatus for applying a printing or cutting force to an elongated strip of tape comprises a base 14 for supporting the strip 30 and a printing or cutting chip 29 in an aligned manner. A wedge shaped force exerting element 15 has a curved force exerting surface 25 for engagement with the printing or cutting chip 29 . The element 25 is supported in a pair of parallel, upwardly extending side walls 11 and 12 of the base 14 . Rollers 35 pivoted to the force exerting element 15 to rotate about the axis of curvature of the force exerting surface 25 engage guide slots 18 provided in each of the side walls 11 and 12 and extending parallel to the plane of the base 14 which supports the strip 30 and the chip 29 . Guide pins 34 also provided on the force exerting element 15 engage further slots in the side walls 11 and 12 , each of these further slots having a first section 19 extending parallel to the slot 18 , and a second section 20 extending at an angle downwardly towards the base 14 . When the force exerting element 15 is operated by its handle 22 , it will move from a rest position, in which the force exerting surface 25 is spaced from the chip 29 , to an operating position in which the surface 25 exerts a force on the chip 29 to carry out the cutting or printing. During this movement the pins 34 will travel along the first section 19 of the further slot and then along the inclined second section 20 thereof, and during this latter travel, the force exerting element 15 will be tilted about the axis of the rollers 35 so that the surface 25 will perform a rolling, force exerting movement to transfer a printing or cutting force from the chip 29 to the strip of tape 30 .
