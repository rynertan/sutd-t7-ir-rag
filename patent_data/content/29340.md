# Interlocking truncated triangular insulator and insulated pipe.

## Abstract
A two piece interlocking insulator 4 suitable for cover ing a truncated triangular pipe 6 , the conforming insulator 4 having a base unit 18 , a pair of side walls 20 convergingly extending from the ends of the base unit and terminating with an apex unit 22 . The insulator 4 can closely conform to the perimeter of the truncated triangular pipe 6 or, as in another embodiment, to a ceramic fibre blanket 10 located around the perimeter of the pipe 6 . Each segment of the insulator has a body 24 and a pair of spaced apart arms 26, 26 . When the two segments are longitudinally and conformingly aligned around the pipe, they can be urged together to form an inter locking, insulator which remains around the pipe without any other means of support. When two truncated triangular pipes are aligned so that their base members are contiguous, an additional embodiment of the insulator includes a pair of segments each having a dou ble angle side wall 44 , a pair of arms 62 partially integral with and partially spaced apart from the double side wall by corresponding recesses and a void corresponding to the re maining double side wall so that as the two segments are con formingly aligned around the pair of pipes, they can be urged together to form an insulator covering. The insulator can further be used with a truncated triangu lar pipe having a pair of shoulders 36 extending outwardly from each side of the apex member 16 and having a ceramic fibre blanket 38 located around both side members and the base member of the pipe.
