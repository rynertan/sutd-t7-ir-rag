# Memory system comprising dynamic memory cells.

## Abstract
Memory system comprising dynamic memory cells, wherein each cell comprises a switchable cell device 10 and a capacitive node 12 , wherein said switchable cell device 10 is connected to a bit line 14 to read the charge stored at said 12 node and to a first word line 16 to selectively switch said cell device 10 responsive to a first signal in said word line 16 . Means are provided for rewriting the cell after reading without discharging the bit line to thereby improve cycle time. The cell includes an independently operated device 24 to access the capacitive storage node 12 to discharge the node of any charge thereon after the reading of a low or no charge bit on the capacitive storage node.
