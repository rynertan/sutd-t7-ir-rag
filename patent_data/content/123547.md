# Product storage bank and merge system.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method are provided for receiving pro ducts, such as stacks of sliced luncheon meat, in an intermit tent flow pattern, for conveying the products in two generally parallel paths at two different flow rates, and for merging the two generally parallel paths into a single path through which the products flow on a non intermittent basis. The two gener ally parallel paths have a fill mode during which an intermit tent grouping of products are received onto the conveyor path, as well as a feed mode during which the intermittent grouping of products are fed in a continuous flow to a merg ing device. When one of the conveyor paths is in its fill mode, the other conveyor path is in its feed mode, and vice versa. The speed of each conveyor path during its fill mode is greater than that during its feed mode.
