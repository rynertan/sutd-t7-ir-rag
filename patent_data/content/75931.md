# Fail safe system in a power regulation circuit for an automotive electronic circuit.

## Abstract
A fail safe system in a power regulation circuit for an automotive electronic circuit such as electronic anti skid brake control system, which fail safe system can perform the fail safe operation even when the power regulation circuit 10 is damaged and thereby the supply voltage from the power regulation circuit 10 varies significantly. The fail safe system in a power regulation circuit includes a monitor power supply circuit 12 independently of the power regulation circuit. The monitor power supply circuit 12 is adapted to produce a reference signal Eâ‚‡ to be compared with the output of the power regulation circuit in a fail safe circuit. The fail safe circuit 13 produces an error signal when the output signal value drops below a given threshold defined by the reference signal value to activate an alarm signal generator 20,Tr1,18 and disconnect an actuator controlled by the control system in order to prevent the actuator from malfunctioning due to errors in the control system.
