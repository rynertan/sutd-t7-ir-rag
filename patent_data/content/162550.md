# Halogen containing lens material.

## Abstract
A lens material having a refractive index n 20 D of at least 1.57 and an Abbé s number ν of at least 30, comprising a copolymer comprising I 10 to 85 by weight of a halogen containing monomer represented by the following formula 1 , II 15 to 90 by weight of a halogen containing monomer represented by the following formula 2 , and III 0 to 20 by weight of a monomer copolymerizable with the above mentioned monomers, the composition of the copolymer being based on the total quantity of the monomers I , II , and III An example of the copolymer is 1 methacryloxy 2,2 di bromomethyl 3 bromopropane methacryloxypolyethyoxy 2,4,6 tribromobenzene styrene divinylbenzene having a n 20 D of 1.596 and a ν of 35.3
