# Permanent magnet field type starting motor provided with an auxiliary pole.

## Abstract
A permanent field type starting motor provided with a permanent magnet 1 , and an auxiliary pole 2 which has higher reversible permeability than that of the per manent magnet 1 . The auxiliary pole 2 is disposed in the circumferential direction of the inner circumfer ence of a yoke 3 and on the magnetizing side of ar mature reaction relative to the center of the pole. The pole arc ratio ϑ₃ ϑ₂ of the auxiliary pole 2 with respect to the center angle of the field is selected in a range from 0.07 to 0.4.
