# A water absorbing rubber composition.

## Abstract
A water absorbing rubber composition comprising A a 1,3 diene rubber with a crystal or glass region content as measured at an ordinary temperature of 5 50 and B a highly water absorbing resin dispersed in the said rubber, the said highly water absorbing resin being a product of crosslinking of a polymer which contains as monomer component thereof at least 40 mole percent of an α,β unsaturated compound containing 1 or 2 groups each selected from the class consisting of a carboxyl group and a group convertible to a carboxyl group with at least one crosslinking agent selected from the class consisting of a polyfunctional epoxy compound and a polyamine, the resin being in the form of a powder capable of passing through a 20 mesh Tyler screen and absorbing 20 500 times its own weight of distilled water. The composition can absorb water rapidly and produce a high swelling pressure, and has good durability in the swollen state.
