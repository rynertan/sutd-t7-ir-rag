# OVERVOLTAGE PROTECTION CIRCUIT FOR SLIC

## Abstract
A high impedance open circuit type of overvoltage protection circuit useful in conjunction with a SLIC 1 is provided. Diodes 7,8 are used to prevent current flow back into the SLIC. In addition, voltage sensitive clamps are provided to clamp the SLIC current source 9,10 and SLIC current sink 11,12 into nonconductive states in the presence of an overvoltage condition.
