# Apparatus for supporting and or conveying a plate with fluid without physical contact.

## Abstract
The method comprises providing a flat surface 11 extending at opening 5 of a delivery pipe 3 to the substantially perpendicular direction to the flow direction of fluid 7 in pipe 3 and providing a ring shaped or annular inhaling opening 4 of a suction pipe 1 around flat surface 11 , the lower periphery of the outer wall of the outer pipe extending lower than flat surface 11 to form a stopper 12 , moving the openings 4 and 5 near the plate 8 , delivering fluid 7 from delivery pipe 3 , inhaling fluid in inhaling opening 4 , to support the plate 8 , such as a semicondcutor wafer or a magnetic disc, near and at a constant distance from flat surface 11 without physical contact therewith, and to prevent disturbance of the surrounding atmosphere by the fluid and attachment of dust on the plate 8 , or providing a flat surface 11 extending at opening 4 of an inhaling pipe 1 to the substantially perpendicular direction to the flow direction of fluid 6 in pipe 1 and providing a ring shaped or annular opening 5 of a delivery pipe 3 around flat surface 11 , or delivering said fluid 7 from said delivery opening 5 .
