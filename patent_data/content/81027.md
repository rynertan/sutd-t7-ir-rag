# Apparatus for intraoperative diagnosis.

## Abstract
An apparatus is described which comprises a refrigerat ing device adapted to sprinkle a cryogenic liquid 2 on the surface of a slide 9 whereby the surface of the slide is cooled fan 7,8 which increases the evaporation of the cryogenic liquid 2 and permits to achieve the necessary hypothermia on the slide 9 an automatic appositor 12 which permits to exert a measurable and graduated pressure onto the slide 9 of the organ which has been interposed between the appositor 12 and the slide 9 at the time in which the section has reached a predetermined temperature. The appositor 12 is provided with means for varying automatically the pressure during the advance of the slide. The refrigerating device comprises a cylinder 1 containing a cyrogenic liquid 2 .
