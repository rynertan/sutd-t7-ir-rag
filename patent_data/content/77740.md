# Magnetic disc device.

## Abstract
In a magnetic disc device, track bytes are added to a record which is to be stored in a cylinder of a magnetic disc in order to utilize an additional magnetic disc device of a different type in the same manner as the first mentioned magnetic disc device. The magnetic device provides a means which checks track bytes read from the record for errors, which stores the track bytes in a track byte register 15 when they are correct, and which, when the stored track bytes are to be read out a later time, utilizes the contents stored in the track byte register 15 as track bytes of the record.
