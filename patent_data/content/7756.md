# Xerographic method and apparatus for producing a composite image.

## Abstract
Positive form overlays are used to make composite images with a positive mode xerographic printer 1 having a laser scan exposure mechanism 3 . The laser scan or elec tronic exposure mechanism 3 uses an oscillating gal vanometer mirror 19 to sweep a scanning spot over a cylin drical shape photoconductor 7 . The xerographic processor includes a transfer drum 12 able to recycle a sheet relative to the photoconductor to transfer at least two sequentially gen erated xerographic toner images to the same side of the same support in registration. One image is made in response to electronic signals and the other from the positive overlay thereby yielding a composite toner image.
