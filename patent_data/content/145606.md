# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device, such as a MOS dynamic RAM device, having memory cells each comprising a transfer gate transistor 10 and a capacitor 11 . The capacitor 11 is a so called groove type capacitor and has a conductive layer 18 formed on an insulation film 17 attached to the inside surface of a groove 16 formed on a semiconductor substrate 12 . The conductive layer 18 is electrically coupled to the source 14 of the transfer gate transistor 10 . The capaci tance of the capacitor 11 is formed between the conductive layer 18 and a second conductive layer 20 formed on the conductive layer 18 via an insulation film 19 , and or be tween the conductive layer 18 and the semiconductor sub strate 12 .
