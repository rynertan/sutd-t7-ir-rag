In process a the groups D4, D5 and D6 may, for example, be carboxylic amide, nitrile or preferably ester, e.g. lower alkyl ester, groups, which may be hydrolysed to a COOH or ACOOH group. The hydrolysis may be carried out using conventional techniques, for example, under mildly basic conditions, e.g. using sodium bicarbonate. The reaction is preferably carried ollt at a temperature of 200 to 120 0C. In process b when L or Z is a reactive metal the metal may, for example, be an alkali metal, e.g. sodium, or another reactive metal, e.g. thallium. When L or Z represents a hydrocarbon chain carrying an anion forming group the anion forming group may be, for example, a halogen atom, e.g. bromine, or a sulphonate group, e.g. a methyl sulphonate or a toluenesulphonate group. When L or Z represents a hydrocarbon chain carrying a halogen atom the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, e.g. acetone and in the presence of an acid acceptor, e.g.potassium carbonate.

In process g , the techniques involved are conventional, including treatment of a compound of formula I which contains an acidic group or a salt thereof with an appropriate base, e.g. a sodium base, or with an appropriate salt by a metathetical process. The starting materials for the above processes are either known or may be made from known starting materials in a manner known for the production of similar known compounds. The processes as described above may produce the compound of formula I or a derivative thereof It is also within the scope of this invention to treat any derivative so produced to liberate the free compound of formula I, or to convert one derivative into another. The compounds of formula I and the intermediates therefore may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques. Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of the compounds of formula I include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and amides of any COOH group present.Suitable salts include ammonium, alkali metal e.g.sodium, potassium and lithium and alkaline earth metal e.g. calcium or magnesium salts, and salts with suitable organic bases, e.g. salts with hydroxylamine, lower alkylamines such as methylamine or ethylamine, with substituted lower alkylamines, e.g. hydroxy substituted alkylamines suc as tris hydroxymethyl methylamine, with simple monocylcic nitrogen heterocyclic compounds. e.g.piperidine or morpholine, with an amino acid, e.g. lysine, ornithine, arginine, or an N alkyl, especially an N methyl derivative of any one thereof, or with an aminosugar, e.g.glucamine, N methylglucamine or glucosamine. Suitable esters include simple lower alkyl esters, e.g. the ethyl ester, esters derived from alcohols containing basic groups, e.g. di lower alkyl amino substituted alkanols such as the 2 diethylamino ethyl ester, and acyloxy alkyl esters, e.g. a lower acyloxy lower alkyl ester such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the basic esters, e.g.the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide, the maleate or the fumarate salts, may also be used. The esters may be made by conventional techniques, e.g. esterification or transesterification. The amides may be, for example, unsubstituted or mono or di C 1 to 6 alkyl or phenyl amides and may be made by conventional techniques, e.g.reaction of an ester of the corresponding acid with ammonia or an appropriate amine. Other pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are compounds which will be suitable bioprecursors prodrugs of the compounds of formula I and will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made from the compounds of formula I using conventional processes known per se or by processes analogous to those described above. The compounds of formula I may, under certain circumstances, be metabolised within the body to form new compounds. These new metabolites are included within the ambit of the invention. The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives possess pharmacological properties. In particular, they are antagonists of the slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A or its pathological effects, as indicated by their activity in the test described by Augstein et al, Nature New Biology, 1973, 245, 215. The compounds are thus indicated for use in the treatment of disorders in which SRS A is a factor, for example skin afflictions, hay fever and obstructive airways diseases, e.g. asthma, bronchitis and bronchorrhea. For the above mentioned uses, the dosage administered will, of course, vary depending upon the compound employed, mode of administration and treatment desired.However, in general satisfactory results are obtained when administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.05 milligrams to about 10 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day or in substained release form. For the larger mammals, the total daily dosage is in the range of from about 1 milligram to about 700 milligrams and dosage forms suitable for administration comprise from about 12 milligrams to about 350 milligrams of the compound admixed with a solid or liquid pharmaceutical carrier or diluent.The compounds may be administered during or before the attack of the disorder to be treated. The compounds of formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, are more active, more stable, more selective, less toxic or possess less side effects when tested in certain pharmacological models, are more potent, have a different e.g. longer duration of action, have a different absorption profile e.g. are better absorbed , are more easily formulated or possess other advantageous properties when compared to similar known compounds. According to our invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising preferably a minor proportion of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Examples of suitable adjuvants, diluents or carriers are for tablets and dragees lactose, starch, talc or stearic acid for capsules, tartaric acid or lactose for suppositories, natural or hardened oils or waxes for inhalation a coarse carrier, e.g. lactose or a compressed gas propellant, e.g. a chlorofluorohydrocarbon, and optionally a surfactant and for topical application, wool fat, soft paraffin or a cream BP.For use in such compositions, the compound of formula I, or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, preferably has a mass median diameter of from 0.01 to 10 microns. The compositions may also contain suitable preserving, stabilising and wetting agents, solubilizers, sweetening and colouring agents and flavourings. The compositions may, if desired, be formulated in sustained release form. We prefer compositions which are designed to be administered by inhalation. The groups R1 to R6, when they contain carbon, preferably contain less than 7 carbon atoms.
