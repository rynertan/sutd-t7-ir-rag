# Data encryption decryption system and method for generating a key word for such a system.

## Abstract
In data encryption decryption system providing for security of data communications channels, a sub system for generating, transporting encryption decryption keys and for introducing those keys into the system while at the same time providing a high level of security for the keys and, hence, the encyption decryption system. Secure data is transferred between at least two security modules and the system includes generating means 32 for generating at least one key word in response to the times of an operator s switch 54 , key loading means 34 being provided for storing and transporting the said at least one key word, and the key loading means 34 and the generating means 32 having interfaces for transferring said at least one key word from the generating means to the key loading means 34 in a form readable only by the system.
