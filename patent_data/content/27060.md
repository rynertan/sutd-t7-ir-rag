# Coordinate measuring machine.

## Abstract
A coordinate measuring machine for measuring parts using cylindrical coordinates includes a base 100 , an articulated arm 210, 220 mounted to the base 100 at its proximate end for movement within a plane, and a vertically movable probe assembly 300 mounted near the distal end of the articulated arm. A horizontal measuring rod 400 extends between the distal end of the articulated arm and the base 100 to provide a measurement of the location of the probe 300 with respect to the base, in terms of a radius and an angular displacement. The probe assembly includes means for measuring perpendicular displacement of the probe from the plane of the articulated arm.
