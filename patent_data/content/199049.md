# Brake slack adjuster.

## Abstract
A brake slack adjuster 10 includes a housing 30 defining a pair of intersecting bores 36,38 therein. A gear 32 is rotatably mounted in one of the bores 36 , and is splined to a cam shaft 24 which mounts a cam brake actuator 22 . A worm shaft 46 is mounted in the other bore 38 and a worm 52 is rotatable with the worm shaft 46 to turn the gear 32 . The worm shaft 46 is supported in the bore 38 by a surface 54 tapering toward the open end 56 of the bore 38 that cooperates with a retaining ring 62 which is received in a circumferentially extending groove 64 circumscribing the bore 38 to retain the worm gear 32 in the bore 38 . The retaining ring 62 terminates in an arm 66 which tapers toward the open end 56 of the bore 38 and engages flats 50 provided on the worm shaft 46 which are adapted to receive a conventional mechanic s socket to turn the shaft when the brake is to be adjusted. The arm 66 yieldably locks the shaft 46 against rotation, to prevent the adjustment from backing off after it is made.
