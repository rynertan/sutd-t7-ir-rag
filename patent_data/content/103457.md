# AN IMPROVED OPTICAL PARTS RECOGNITION TECHNIQUE

## Abstract
Apparatus for optically recognizing the size and configu ration of predetermined workpieces uses a technique of super imposition and comparison of a reference two dimensional image with an image of a workpiece object formed by a lens. A negative transparency 42 processed from photographic film is employed in combination with an optical lens to provide recognition of the orientation and configuration of an object within the field of view of the lens. The lens superimposes an image of an object onto the negative transparency to check the degree of correspondence. A light responsive photocell de velops an output signal proportional to the degree of corres pondence and indicative of the light level transmitted through the negative transparency. The absence of transmitted light indicates correspondence between the object having a known configuration and orientation and the transparent portion image of the negative transparency.
