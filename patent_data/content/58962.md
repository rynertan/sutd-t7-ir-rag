## Description
METHOD OF PREPARING POLYETHYLENE POLYAMINES HAVING IM PROVED COLOR The present invention relates to a process for decolorizing polyethylene polyamines and, more particularly, to a process for producing polyethylene polyamines having improved color characteristics by treatment with hydrochloric acid which may be run continuously. It is well known that polyethylene polyamines, and particularly the higher polyamines, become discolored during their preparation which generally reduces their commercial value. Heretofore, various procedures have been used commercially or suggested for decolorizing or otherwise improving the color of these compounds including, for example, treating with hydrogen chloride or amine hydrochlorides as disclosed in U.K. Patent No 1,351,050 treatment with activated carbon at elevated temperatures about 2000C treatment with potassium hydroxide and treatment with zinc metal, zinc metal and water, or zinc metal and an alkali. In each of these procedures, distillation is generally a final step needed to achieve the desired color, and neutralization of residues, handling and separation of metal powders, or reactivation of the treatment medium require special apparatus which complicate the process. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge none of these procedures are completely suitable for the continuous preparation of decolorized polyamines. It would, thus, be highly desirable if a process was developed which was generally simple but could be employed to decolorize various polyamines, and particularly the higher polyamines, to obtain color levels of 100 Platinum Cobalt or less, that did not require special or complicated apparatus and or procedures, and did not involve the handling or disposal of treating materials. A process that could be used to continuously prepare decolorized polyamines would be particularly advantageous. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for producing polyethylene polyamines having a low color of.the general formula NH2 CH2CH2NH nH where n is an integer of 1 to 5 from discolored polyethylene polyamines which comprises treating discolored polyethylene polyamines with polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride in the presence of water at elevated temperatures for the time necessary to reduce the color of said polyethylene polyamines and then flash evaporating the decolorized polyethylene polyamines from the treating mixture. Preferably the decolorization step digestion step is carried out under pressures high enough to maintain water in the liquid phase. The decolorized polyethylene polyamines that are separated from the treatment mixture during the flash evaporation step of the process contains up to 80 85 percent of the discolored polyamines that were treated along with substantially all the water from the mixture, but the decolorized polyamine product can be readily separated from the water by means well known in the art without the need for neutralization or similar procedures. It has also been discovered that the residue mixture in the evaporator contains polyamine hydrochlorides which may be used for decolorizing of discolored, crude polyethylene polyamineswhen a small amount of water is added to the treatment mixture prior to carrying out the decolorization step.Thus, the need for discarding the polyamine hydrochloride containing residue composition or even the need for any neutralization step is eliminated. In accordance with the present invention there is also provided a continuous process for producing polyethylene polyamines having improved color properties as hereinabove described which comprises treating a discolored polyethylene polyamine with polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride in the presence of water at elevated temperatures for the time necessary to prepare decolorized polyethylene polyamines, flash evaporating the decolorized polyethylene polyamine from said treatment mixture as hereinabove disclosed and then employing the polyamine hydrochloride residue from said flash evaporation step in treating further amounts of discolored polyethylene polyamines in the presence of water at elevated temperatures. The process of the invention may be used to readily treat discolored, crude polyethylene polyamines with colors up to a Gardner Scale No. 14 or even higher to obtain polyethylene polyamines with a low color of 100 Platinum Cobalt or even less. According to the present invention there is provided a process for producing decolorized polyethylene polyamines of the general formula NH2 CH2CH2NH nH wherein n is an integer of 1 to 5 from discolored polyethylene polyamines of the same general formula which comprises treating said discolored polyethylene polyamines with polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride in the presence of water at pressures and temperatures to be more fully described hereinafter for the time necessary to reduce the color of said discolored polyethylene polyamine. The decolorized polyethylene polyamine treatment solution is then subjected to flash evaporation conditions which readily separates substantial amounts of the decolorized polyethylene polyamine and water from the treatment mixture. Polyethylene polyamines to which the present invention relates are compounds of the general formula NH2 CH2CH2NH nH wherein n is an integer from 1 to 5. Suitable polyethylene polyamines are predominately linear chain compounds having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms such as diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine and the like. The discolored polyamines to which the present invention relates can be prepared by any of the processes well known in the art such as where a crude mixture of polyamines is produced and then subjected to refining procedures where desired individual polyamines or mixtures thereof are separated and recovered. The polyamine products recovered from the various refining or separation processes are, in general, discolored, having Gardner Color No s from about 1 to 14 or even higher. The polyethylene polyamine hydrochlorides which may be used as a decolorizing agent in accordance with the present invention are prepared by reacting a polyethylene polyamine and hydrochloric acid. Suitable polyethylene polyamine hydrochlorides may be prepared in situ by adding hydrochloric acid, usually as an aqueous solution to the discolored polyethylene polyamine and then allowing a suitable time for reaction during which the solution is stirred. Also suitable for use is the polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride residue obtained from a prior decolorizing treatment of polyethylene polyamines which hydrochloride containing residue is effective when suitable amounts of water are also present in the treating mixture. The amount of polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride that should be employed is not narrowly critical and only a small amount may be needed. Usually the amount of polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride used is from 0.1 to 10 percent, and preferably 0.5 to 5, percent by weight of the HCl component based on the weight of polyethylene polyamine to be decolorized. It is very important that water is present during the decolorizing treatment step digestion step to obtain the desired decolorization, though the amount of water required to be present is not narrowly critical. In general, from about 1 to about 12 percent by weight of water based on the weight of the decolorizing treatment mixture, and preferably from about 2 to 5 times the calculated weight of contained HC1, would be suitable though greater amounts of water may be present. The water may be added to the treatment mixture by itself, as a component of a hydrochloric acid solution, in combination with the polyamine hydrochloride residue, or in any other convenient manner. After hydrochloric acid or polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride and water are added to the discolored polyethylene polyamines in a reaction vessel digestion tank the mixture is agitated and heated to a temperature within the range from about 2000C to about 2300C. The mixture is maintained at a temperature within the range of at least about 1800C up to a temperature at which the polyethylene polyamines will be discolored or decomposed generally to about 240 C , and preferably from about 2000C to about 2300C at pressures from around atmospheric to 100 psig, for the time necessary to obtain polyamines having the desired color values, generally from less than about 1 hour to about four hours.While the pressure that should be maintained in the digestion tank is not narrowly critical, it is preferred that the pressure used is high enough to maintain a substantial amount of the water in a liquid state, and pressures in the range from about 25 to 60 psig have been advantageously employed. After completion of the decolorization reaction digestion step , the decolorized polyethylene polyamines treatment mixture is subjected to a flash evaporation procedure by heating the mixture to a temperature in the range from about 1700C up to 2000C at reduced pressures, generally from about 25 mm Hg to 60 mm Hg absolute and the flash evaporated components are collected. Substantially colorless polylethylene polyamines and water are obtained as the flash evaporated products. The polyethylene polyamine hydrochlorides remain as a residue in the evaporator after completion of the flash evaporation step. It has been found that the temperature in the evaporator has a direct relation to the color of the refined polyamines and temperatures below 200GC are especially preferred.The polyethylene polyamine hydrochloride containing residue which remains in the evaporator may be advantageously used for the decolorization treatment of further amounts of discolored polyamines as herein described or may be neutralized with an aqueous caustic solution to liberate the polyethylene polyamines which can be recovered by well known distillation procedures. In an alternate procedure which may be run on a continuous basis, crude, discolored polyethylene polyamines are initially mixed with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or with recycled polyethylene polyamine hydrochlorides in a circulated tank digestion tank maintained at a temperature in the range of from about 1800C to about 2400C and a pressure in the range of from atmospheric to 100 psig and preferably from about 25 psig to about 60 psig. Water is added to the mixture to maintain the amount thereof in the digestion tank at a level of about 2 to 5 times the calculated weight of hydrogen chloride contained in the polyamine hydrochlorides.During the continuous operation of the process, small amounts of an aqeuous solution of hydrochloric acid are added to maintain the acid concentration in the digestion tank consistent with the desired color of the decolorized polyethylene polyamines and to replace acid which is periodically purged from the flash evaporator. The average residence time in the digestion tank may be from less than about 1 hour to about 4 hours depending on the color of the crude discolored polyethylene polyamine and amount of acid in the tank. After an initial start up period in the digestion tank during which the initial charge of discolored polyamines have been treated for the desired length of time, portions of the treatment mixture can be fed continuously to a flash evaporator while additional amounts of discolored polyamines can be fed to the digestion tank. Refined, decolorized polyethylene polyamines are produced by flash evaporation in the evaporator at reduced pressures of less than 100mm Hg absolute and preferably less than about 60mm Hg absolute. The flash evaporator is maintained at a temperature up to 2000C, and preferably not exceeding about 1800C. In general, approximately 80 85 percent of the mixture fed to the evaporator is flash evaporated consisting of the refined polyethylene polyamines and substantially all of the water in the mixture.The water which is evaporated is separated from the refined polyethylene polyamines prior to condensation of the refined, decolorized polyamines. The residue in the evaporator which comprises primarily polyethylene polyamine hydrochlorides is continuously recycled to the digestion tank and used to provide the hydrochloride decolorization agent for the treatment of further amounts of discolored, crude polyamines. Small amounts of the recycle polyamine hydrochloride residue from the evaporator may be periodically purged to prevent an excessive accumulation therein of heavy polyamines and to maintain a consistently low temperature in the flash evaporator since the temperature in the flash evaporator has a direct relation to the color of the refined polyamine products. The purged polyamine hydrochloride is generally neutralized and the heavier polyamines are recovered by distillation. The invention will become ,ore clear when considered with the following examples which are set forth as being merely illustrative of the invention and which are not intended in any manner, to be limitative thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. Further, comparison of the hue of the decolorized polyamine products was carried out with reference to a platinum cobalt Pt Co hue standard.The Pt CO hue standard was measured in accordance withASTMD 1209 54. The hue standard is prepared in such a manner that 1.23 grams K2PtC16 and 1,000 grams of CoC11. 6H2O are dissolved in water and 100 ml. of hydrochloric acid having a specific gravity of 1.18 is added to the above solution and the resulting solution is diluted with water to obtain one liter and the resulting diluted solution is defined as hue standard no. 500. Further, by diluting it to 1 10 or 1 100, the hue standard No. 50 or No. 5 is obtained. EXAMPLE 1 A charge of 1152 grams of crude triethylenetetramine TETA which contains small amounts of other heavy polyamines having a Gardner Scale Number of 12 13 is fed to a laboratory stirred kettle fitted with a short distillation column packed with stainless steel sponge, a goose neck head, and a condenser, and 91 grams of a 37 percent aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid is added with stirring. The mixture is heated with stirring at 2000C for 2.5 hours while sufficient water is refluxed to maintain the temperature at about 2000 C. The pressure on the kettle is then reduced to 50 mm Hg absolute and at a temperature of 1860C, 800 grams of refined triethylenetetramine is flash evaporated from the kettle and condensed. The distillate has a color hue of 30 platinum cobalt. A 25 gram sample of the residue in the kettle is removed and analysis shows it to contain 8.77 percent HC1. An additional charge of 1152 grams of crude triethylenetetramine having a Gardner Number of 12 13 is fed to the kettle which contains the residue from the previous run of this example along with 47 grams of water and 36 grams of a 37 percent aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. The mixture is heated at 2000C with stirring for 2.5 hours and then allowed to stand for an additional 16 hours at 2000C. The pressure on the kettle is then reduced to 50 mm Hg absolute and the mixture is subjected to flash evaporation at 1860C. 956 grams of refined triethylenetetramine is flash evaporated and then condensed. The refined TETA is determined to have a color hue of 15 Pt Co. A 25 gram sample of the residue in the tank is removed and determined to contain 8.99 percent of HCl. A third portion of 1152 grams of the same crudeTETA as used in the first two runs of this example is charged along with 100 grams of water to the kettle which contains the residue from the previous two runs of this example. The mixture is heated at 2000C with stirring for four hours after which the pressure is reduced in the kettle to 50 mm Hg absolute. At a flash evaporation temperature of 1960C, 950 grams of refinedTETA is evaporated and then condensed. The refined TETA is determined to have a color hue of 25 Pt Co. EXAMPLE 2 Using the apparatus of Example 1, 746 grams of crude triethylenetetramine TETA having a Gardner Scale color of 14 which contains small amounts of other polyamines is mixed with 58 grams of 37 percent hydrochloric acid with stirring The mixture is heated at 2000C with stirring for 1.5 hours. The pressure in the reactor is then reduced to 50mm Hg absolute and at temperatures in the range of 1950C to 2050C, 652 grams of TETA is evaporated and then condensed. The color hue of the refined TETA is determined to be 70 Pt Co but it is noted that during evaporation of the TETA, the color of the last portion evaporated at 2050F increased significantly. A sample of 33 grams of the residue remaining after the evaporation step is removed from the tank.A series of 7 additional runs are made by adding additional charges of crude TETA to the residue in the reactor along with make up amounts of hydrochloric acid and water. The proportion of ingredients employed in each of the runs of this example, and the color of refined TETA obtained from each run is summarized inTable 1. Each of the charges of crude TETA employed have a Gardner Scale color of 14. TABLE I TETA Crude Makeup c Makeup Final Evap.

The contents of the autoclave are then charged to a single stage distillation apparatus where 75 percent of the organic materials are evaporated over a temperature range of 1400C to 1680C at 1 mm Hg absolute pressure. The distillate is determined to contain 88 percent of tetraethylenepentamine having a color hue of 100 Pt Co. The organic residue in the evaporator distillation apparatus is determined to contain 15 percent HC1. EXAMPLE 4 A stirred 500 ml kettle with a short column section packed with stainless steel sponge, a goose neck head, and condenser are employed in this Example to carry out a series of runs. While each of the runs of this example are performed in a batch operation, they are carried out in a cyclic manner to simulate a continuous system with a procedure including recycle and purge of evaporator residues from previous runs being used. A charge of 200 grams of crude, discolored polyamines containing about 95 triethylenetetramine, small amounts of other polyamines and about 0.25 weight percent of HC1 is used in each run. The digestion temperature is held at 2000C for 3 hours except where noted otherwise in each of the runs of the example.The operating conditions, proportion of ingredients used, and color properties for products produced for each of the runs are summarized in Table II. The results reported in Table II show that the increasingly higher flash evaporation temperatures employed in Run Nos. 1 4 result in progressively higher product color, Run No. 5 shows that the use of a lower digestion temperature results in higher color, Run Nos.9 12 show that the color of refined TETA becomes progressively higher when HC1 is not added to make up for HC1 removed from the system by purging the evaporator residue.
