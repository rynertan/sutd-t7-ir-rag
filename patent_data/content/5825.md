# Energy conversion method and system.

## Abstract
A mechanical energy conversion method and system for the restoration of dissipated heat energy, contained in natural or artificial water bodies at or near ambient temperatures, to industrial process heat, mainly in the form of steam up to 200 400 C. In at least one evaporation chamber 15,22,29,36 the sensible heat contained in a water body is concentrated as latent heat in low pressure water vapor which is thermo compressed by steam ejection 52,58,59,60 to an intermediate pressure level 85 , wherefrom mechanical compression 88 takes over, generating highly superheated output steam 95 . The ejection steam is not generated in a boiler, but is continously regenerated by the compressor 88 and routed back for repeated ejection. The compressor 88 is driven by a heat engine 90 whose reject heat is collected and upgraded as well. The output of heat energy is essentially equal to the sum of the heating value of the fuel consumed and the intake of latent heat and amounts thus to substantially more than the heating value of the fuel alone.
