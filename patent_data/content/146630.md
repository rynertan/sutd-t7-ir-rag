# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING QUANTITY OF MILK OBTAINED BY MILKING MACHINE.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring the quantity of milk obtained by a milking machine. Unlike a conventional measuring apparatus in which a measuring means alternate ly rotates two storage tanks, this measuring apparatus is provided with only one storage tank 5 on a pivoting member 2 acting as a measuring means. The storage tank 5 , when being filled with milk, is retained by a weighted balance type of means using a weight, instead of a conven tional means which employs the magnetic force of a magnet, so that it is possible to effect an accurate measurement and reduce the size of the apparatus. Also disclosed is a method of measuring the total quantity of milk using this measuring apparatus, in which the quantity of milk filling the storage tank 5 and the quantity of milk which fails to flow into the storage tank 5 when discharged thereinto are both mea sured by measuring the oscillation period of the pivoting member 2 . This method enables a more accurate measure ment than that obtained by the conventional measuring method.
