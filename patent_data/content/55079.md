# HYDRAULIC DRIVE SYSTEM FOR PNEUMATIC CUSHIONS USED IN SEAT TO PROVIDE MOTION SIMULATION

## Abstract
A seat 3 for use in a vehicle simulator which seat includes at least one pneumatic cushion 5 and a bellows arrangement 9 for controlling the pressure in the cushion, and thus the level of the top surface of the cushion. The bellows arrangement 9 and the cushion 5 together define a closed volume system. A pis ton and cylinder 15 is connected to a rod 17 which serves to expand or contract the bellows in accordance with signals generated by a controller 21 supplied to a servovalve 19 for the piston and cylinder 15. Typically, the seat 3 has four seat cush ions 5 and four back rest cushions 5, each of which cushions 5 has its own respective bellows pressure control arrangement, whereby the top surface of any selected cushion may be caused to rise or fall, thereby feeding motion cues to a person sitting in the seat.
