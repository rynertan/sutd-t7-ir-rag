# COMBINED STOP COCK CHAMBER AND SURFACE BOX

## Abstract
A combined stop cock chamber and surface box com prises a plastic tube in two parts 10,11. The upper part 11 forms a surface box and is telescopically attached to the lower part 10 which houses the stop cock. The two parts can be resiliently supported on a plastic plate to allow the surface box to be depressed resiliently by a load such as a vehicle wheel. A ball valve housing 20 is moulded in the lower part 10 to prevent back siphonage.
