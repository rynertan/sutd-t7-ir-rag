# Shear frame mounting and positioning mechanism.

## Abstract
A shear frame mounting and positioning mechanism for linearly reciprocal shear blades in which the shear frame 10 can be adjusted in a horizontal plane in a direction parallel to and perpendicular to the direction of travel of the shear blades 12, 14 . Additionally, the shear frame 10 is tiltable in a vertical plane which is parallel to the direction of move ment of the shear blades 12, 14 . A mechanism 142 is provided for locking the shear frame under the feeder spout, the mechanism including means for adjusting the shear frame in a direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the shear blades. The shear frame 10 can be swung between a position under the feeder spout 6 to a position out from underneath the feeder spout 6 and also raised and lowered in a vertical direction.
