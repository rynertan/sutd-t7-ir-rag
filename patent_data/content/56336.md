# Pig rearing unit.

## Abstract
A rearing unit, suitable for piglets, has a heated nest box 4 with openable roof 8 , a pen 5 in communication with the nest box 4 having a perforated floor, a liquid feeding device 20 in the pen having one or more artificial nipples and a solids feed device. The nest box temperature may be thermostatically con trolled by a sensor 19 below a perforated floor of the nest box. The unit may be constructed from a slotted framework and boards, the boards being sealed in the slots by an adhesive or inert water repellant sealant. The unit may house very young piglets up to a weight of from 5 to 8 kg. At that weight, they may then be transferred to a similar unit with a larger nest box until they weigh from 10 to 15 kg.
