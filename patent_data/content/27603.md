# Process for applying a photoresist, and photoresist solution.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to processes for using a light sensitive photoresist material in the manufacture of an article having a surface permanently modified in an image pattern. The process comprises applying the photoresist to a substrate through a screen, preferably as a continuous, incompletely imaged layer and thereafter, imaging and developing to pro vide a relief image in the photoresist layer and treating the substrate to provide a permanent image in the finished article. The process is particularly useful in the manufacture of printed circuits. The process is believed to be a departure from conventional processes in the step of screening a light sensi tive photoresist material over a substrate.
