# CMOS power on detection circuit.

## Abstract
A CMOS power on detection circuit is described which includes pairs of complementary MOS transistors being connected in series between two supply lines. Each pair of transistors includes a long and a short channel transistor. Biasing the transistors by the rising supply voltage and by the voltages on the nodes formed by the pairs respectively allows to reduce or to cut current consumption once the detection is performed.
