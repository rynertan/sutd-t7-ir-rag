# Crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, synthesis and use thereof.

## Abstract
A new crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite, designated ZSM 43, possessing a silica alumina ratio in the range 5 to 20, and a unique X ray diffraction pattern. The zeolite can be synthesised from a reaction mixture containing sodium, cesium and organic nitrogen cations and is useful in catalysis of various organic conversion reactions.
