# Microwave electromagnetic borehole dipmeter.

## Abstract
A dipmeter for use in the determination of the dip of subsurface earth formations comprising a logging tool including a continuous source of microwave energy, three microwave antennas spaced from and arranged generally symmetrically around the longitudinal axis of the logging tool, and a device for measuring the loading effect on the three antennas as the three antennas continuously transmit microwave energy into the formations during movement of the logging tool through the borehole.
