# DIAGNOSTIC ELECTRODE MEMBRANES UTILIZING SPECIFIC ENZYME IONOPHORE PAIRS

## Abstract
A hydrophobic, chemically inert, dielectric polymer mem brane for the potentiometric detection of analytes is disclosed. The membrane has bonded to one surface an enzyme capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of the analyte to yield an ion. The in terior of the membrane contains an ionophore which is cap able of complexing with the ion.
