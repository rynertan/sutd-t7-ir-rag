# Flow control valve.

## Abstract
A flow control valve 14 comprises a slidable valve member 18 and a variable orifice structure 20 . The valve member slides in response to a pressure differential, created by fluid flow through the variable orifice structure, to bypass fluid in a positive displacement pump 10 . The variable orifice structure is a self contained unit including a longitudinally movable pin 36 which has a variable cross section and is disposed in an orifice aperture 30 . The longitudinal position of the pin in the aperture controls the size of the orifice and therefore imposes a variable flow restriction which creates the pressure differential. The flow control valve is useful with power steering hydraulic pumps and systems where it is desirable to reduce the amount of hydraulic fluid which is delivered to the steering mechanism when the pump input speed exceeds a predetermined value.
