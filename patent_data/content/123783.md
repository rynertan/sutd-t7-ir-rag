# Apparatus for compressing and buffering data.

## Abstract
Apparatus for compressing and buffering large amounts of data, transferring the buffered data to a slower speed storage device and controlling the stopping and start ing of the central processing unit CPU 10 is provided for a virtual storage computer system where the data is collect ed in real time the data being collected are all storage addresses to facilitate address tracing. Each real main storage address is collected at the external interface be tween the CPU 10 and main storage 50 and converted to a virtual address. The virtual address is compressed and entered into a large buffer 500 via buffer control logic 400 . The buffer control logic sends a signal 441 to stop the CPU when the buffer becomes full and a signal 442 to restart it at the exact point it had stopped after the buffer 500 has been emptied by the transfer of data from it to a slower speed storage device.
