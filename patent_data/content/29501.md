# Heat sink member and aircooling system for semiconductor modules.

## Abstract
An air cooled high density integrated circuit system wherein heat sink structures are located on one of the surfaces of the modules 10 in the system. The structure includes a plurality of hollow round or flat heat conductive members 12 having an opening or openings 22 extending from the module surface toward, but not reaching, the top of the member. Air flow is directed substantially perpendicular to the upper end of the members 12 . The air flow will be from the top of the members 12 and out of the opening or openings 22, 32 to cool the heat sink members and the module.
