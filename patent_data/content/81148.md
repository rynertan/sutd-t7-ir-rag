# Snap fastener for use on garments.

## Abstract
A snap fastener for use on garment pieces 12, 15 comprises a male member 10 attached by a first rivet 11 to one of the garment pieces 12 and a female member 10 attached by a second rivet 14 to the other garment piece 15 . The male member 10 includes a first cylindrical wall 16 having an annular rim 18 snapped in an annular groove 29 defined in a second cylindrical wall 24 of the female member 13 . The male member 10 and the first rivet 11 have reinforcing ribs 23,35 biting in the garment piece 12 sandwiched therebetween, and similarly the female member 13 and the second rivet 14 have reinforcing ribs 31,35 held in biting engagement with the garment 15 sandwiched therebetween. The male and female members 10,13 and the first and second rivets 11,14 are prevented by these reinforcing ribs 35 from rotating with respect to the garment pieces 12,15 , an advantage which manifests itself especially where the first and second rivets 11,15 have directional ornamental patterns on their heads 32 . The first and second cylindrical walls 16,24 of the male and female members 10,13 have slots 20 and cavities 28 to allow the annular rim 18 to resiliently fit snappingly into the annular groove 29 without cracking or deforming the male and female members 10,13 . The first and second rivets 11,14 have pointed shanks 33,33 piercing the garment pieces 12,15 and fitted in the male and female members 10,13 , respectively. The pointed shanks 33 have angularly spaced ridges 36 held in frictional engagement with the male and female members 10,13 to prevent backlashes between the first and second rivets 11,14 and the male and female members 10,13 .
