## Abstract
In an elastic suspension system provided with a shock absorber 6, 106 for the rear wheel 5 of a motor cycle, in which the shock absorber 6, 106 is pivotally connected by its lower end to a shock absorber supporting lever 11 being in its turn fulcrumed onto the fork 3 , a guide arm is provided, which by one end is hinged to the shock absorber supporting lever 11 and by its opposite end is hinged to the motor cycle frame 1 at a point 15 located at a higher level than the pivot point 2 of the fork 3 , and in such a manner as to obtain an articulated quadrilateral 2, 15, 13, 12 with no intersecting sides, wherby the excursion of the shock absorber 6, 106 is increased and it becomes possible to provide only one shock absorber 6, 106 arranged in the same vertical plane as the rear wheel 5 .
