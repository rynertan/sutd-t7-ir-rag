# Tamper resistant capsules.

## Abstract
A hard shell tamper resistant capsule having cylindri cal, telescopically joinable, coaxial cap and body parts 2, 1 is disclosed. Each part has a side wall 8, 7 , an open end and a closed end, the cap and body parts being adapted to be telescopically joined. The body closed end has an exter nal surface configuration which is resistant to being gripped, for example hemispheroidal, pyramidal, conical or flat and the body side wall 8 is totally enclosed within the cap side wall 7 when the cap and body parts 2, 1 are joined. Thus, only the outside surface of the body closed end is exposed for gripping whereby separation of and tam pering with the joined capsule is impeded. For additional security the tamper resistant capsule may be provided with locking means of circumferentially extending ridges or grooves 6 . For further security the tamper resistant capsule may be sealed by the application of hot water, steam, hot solu tions or emulsions.
