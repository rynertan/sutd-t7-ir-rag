# Electromagnetic acoustic measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic acoustic measuring apparatus is disclosed in which an exciting coil 11, 12 is wound around a body 1 to be inspected in order to generate a magnetic field within the body 1 in the direction parallel to a surface of the body 1 , a transmitting coil 13 is used to generate mechanical strain in the surface of the body 1 by utilizing the magnetic field, a receiving coil 13 detects the mechani cal strain at the surface of the body 1 after the mechanical strain has been propagated in the body 1 , the exciting coil 11, 12 is enclosed with a separable core 14 , the transmit ting and receiving coils are supported by respective head portions of pole pieces fixed to the core 14 , and the transmitting and receiving coils and pole pieces are water cooled by means of cooling pipes.
