## Description
IMPACT RESISTANT BLEND AND .METHOD FOR MATING IT This invention relates to a resin blend having high impact strength. Various blends based on polyester resin, polycarbonate resin, or graft copolymer rubber resin materials have heretofore been proposed e.g., U.S. patents 3,591,659 3,919,353 4,022,748 4,034,013 4,034,016 4,044,073 4,096,202 4,257,937 4,260,690 and 4,280,949 . The present invention is based on a blend of a polyester resin, b polycarbonate resin and c graft copolymer composition comprising EPDM type rubber grafted with at least one polar monomer. The blend of the invention has unexpected properties, particularly high impact strength in combination with heat resistance. The polyester resin component a of the blend of the invention is ordinarily poly l,4 butylene terephthalate and is described for example in U.S. patents 2,465,319 3,047,539 4,257,937 and 4,280,949. The polycarbonate resin component b of the blend of the invention is ordinarily an aromatic polycarbonate resin and is described for example in U.S. patents 4,034,016 4,257,937 and 4,280,949. The graft copolymer material c constituting the third component of the invention is ordinarily based on a graft copolymer of resin forming monomeric material on a rubbery unsaturated spine polymer of the ethylenepropylene non conjugated diene type EPDM , although saturated rubber spine of the ethylene propylene copolymer type EPM may also be used.The grafted monomeric material is ordinarily at least one polar monomer such as an alkenoic nitrile, ester, amide or acid, or a vinyl aromatic monomer such as styrene mixtures of such alkenoic monomer and vinyl aromatic monomer are particularly useful in preparing the graft copolymer. Useful monomers include such acids as acrylic and methacrylic acid, and esters of such acids including methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, 2 ethylhexyl and cyclohexyl esters acrylamide and methyacrylamide may be used, as well as vinyl acetate, styrene also substituted styrenes , maleic acid anhydride, acrylonitrile, and the like. Such monomers usually comprise 5 75 by weight of the graft copolymer. It will be understood that in practice the product of the graft copolymerization process is actually a mixture of true graft of resin on rubber along with a certain amount of separate, ungrafted resin that is, the grafting efficiency is not 100 see U.S. patent 4,202,948, Peascoe. In preparing the graft copolymer either saturated EPM ethylene propylene copolymer or unsaturated EPDM ethylene propylene non conjugated diene e.g., ethyli dene norbornene, dicyclopentadiene, hexadiene terpoly mer may be used. The proportion of the three polymeric ingredi ents may vary, as indicated in the following table, wherein the amounts are expressed in parts by weight per 100 parts of blend Parts by Weight Broad Preferred More Preferred a polyester resin 20 90 40 80 60 80 b polycarbonate resin 5 60 10 30 10 20 c graft copolymer 5 50 10 50 10 20 Preferred compositions include a major proportion of the polyester resin component a which retains good prop erties at elevated temperature, along with sufficient polycarbonate resin b and graft copolymer c to provide high notched impact strength. Although it is possible to use modifier c levels above 20 the driving force for a commercial modifier is to be able to use as little as possible such an increase would tend to improve low temperature impact strength at the expense of hardness, tensile strength and stiffness. There is no specific upper limit for the level of polycarbonate b . Blends containing 40 or more of b are capable of providing satisfactory results. To prepare the blends of the invention, the polyester resin component a , the polycarbonate resin component b , and the graft copolymer composition c are mixed together at elevated temperature in conventional plastics mixing equipment, such as a twin screw extruder mixer. If desired, any two of the components may be mixed together first, followed by mixing in of the third component. One desirable mixing procedure is a two step compounding process involving first working the graft copolymer composition c without the other ingredients a and b , under shearing and fluxing conditions, for example in a twin screw extruder mixer. This disperses the EPDM within the resin contained in the graft copolymer composition, to form an inverted composition in which the EPDM rubber is the discontinuous phase. The second step involves fluxing the inverted graft component c with the polyester component a and the polycarbonate component b under lower shear conditions, for example in a single screw extruder.In commercial practice these two steps can be combined in one extrusion operation, using an extruder having a first and second feedport a section of the extruder downstream of the first feedport can be used to shear invert the graft copolymer c and a section downstream of the second feedport can be used to mix the graft with the other ingredients a and b . The inverted graft composition a may also be pelletized and tumble blended with polyester a and polycarbonate b pellets to form a physical mixture which can be fed into an injection molding machine or an extruder. In this case the plasticizing screw of the injection or extrusion machine can perform the second stage of mixing during fabrication. As indicated, in one aspect the invention is based on the discovery that three component blends of polybutylene terephthalate resin PBT with polycarbonate resin and EPDM grafted with at least one polar monomer have high impact strength. Particularly desirable products are those in which the grafting monomers are styrene acrylonitrile, styrene methyl methacrylate, and methyl methacrylate.The presence of polycarbonate resin is required for high notched Izod impact strength. The following example will serve to illustrate the practice of the invention in more detail. Example Three graft copolymers, designated A, B and C inTable I below, are prepared by the slurry technique described in U.S. Patent 4,202,948 Peascoe using an ethylene propylene ethylidene norbornene EPDM terpolymer rubber E P ratio 60 40 Mooney viscosity 68 ML 4 at 2570F, iodine number 20 as the spine rubber. The resin forming monomers in each graft are indicated in Table I, which gives the composition of the resin portion of the graft copolymers. The overally resin EPDM ratio in the graft copolymer is 50 50 in each case. Table 1 Resin Ratio A styrene acrylonitrile 72 28 B styrene methyl methacrylate 50 50 C methyl methacrylate 100 The blends listed in Table 2 are prepared by first fluxing the graft copolymers A, B or C in a 53 mmWerner and Pfleiderer twin screw extruder equipped with a strand die and pelletizer. The pelletized grafts are then fluxed with PBT VALOX 310 trademark and polycarbonate resin reaction product of bis phenol A with phosgene LEXAN 103 trademark in a one inch single screw extruder to make the blend shown in Table 2. Specimens for mechanical property testing are cut from 1 8 inch injection molded plaques. Blends 5, 8 11, 13, 15 and 16 in Table 2 illustrate the practice of the invention although blends 9 11 indicate that the optimum levels for polycarbonate resin and for the graft copolymer are each over 10 by weight.The other materials in Table 2 are controls prepared from unmodified PBT 1 or two component PBT blends containing polycarbonate 2 or the graft copolymer 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12 . In Table 2 the amounts of each component are expressed in parts by weight PBT stands for polybutylene terephthalate resin, PC stands for polycarbonate resin, NIRT stands for notched Izod impact strength at room temperature reported in foot pounds per inch of notch and NI 200F stands for notched Izod impact strength at 200F Rockwell R indicates the hardness.
