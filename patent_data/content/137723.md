# Preparation of polymer polyols.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a fluid polymer polyol containing a greater than 30 by weight polymer and or b a poly acrylonitrile styrene copolymer comprising between 65 and 90 by weight polystyrene is provided. By using a peroxydicarbonate catalyst during the process products of improved viscosity and filtrability are produced.
