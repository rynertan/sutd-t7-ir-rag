# Procedure for chemical, automatic dissolution of molybdenum core wire in tungsten filament coil and a device for implementing the procedure.

## Abstract
This procedure means that molybdenum core wire in tungsten filament coils for light sources can be dissolved chemically without releasing nitrous gases to the atmos phere. Since the solution reaction takes place under vacuum and with a metered supply of oxygen, while retaining the vacuum, the nitrous gases which have been formed can be converted in the process. The process acid also contains sulphuric acid and water. The reaction vessel can be cooled by means of tempering in the introductory stage of the dissolution reaction, since this stage is markedly exothermic. The reaction vessel can be heated in the final stage so that the dissolution of core wire becomes complete. The device for implementing the procedure consists of a reaction vessel 1 with a tempering jacket 2 and fitted with an inlet and outlet 6 for process acid. An oxygen pipe 7 containing a metering valve 8 runs to the vessel 1 . This valve is controlled by pressure sensing devices 12, 13 on a liquid trap 10 fitted on a pipeline 9 running from the reaction vessel. The liquid trap can suitably contain an alkali solution. The pipeline 9 can be fitted with a cooler 11 for condensate acid vapour from the reaction vessel 1 .
