# Condition sensing arrangement for A.C. machines.

## Abstract
An arrangement for sensing the operating condition of an alternating current machine 10 employs a Hall switch 32 on the stator 12 which is subjected to the alternating magnetic field established during operation. The Hall switch 32 has a magnetic field strength threshold below which it will not be ac tuated. During normal operation of the machine, the alternating field strength will cyclically exceed the switch threshold, there by generating a series of pulses at the frequency of alternation of the field. Should the field strength decrease as a result of overload of the machine, or a decrease in line voltage, to a level below the threshold level of the switch 32 , the pulse output of the switch will cease. Circuitry 34, 36, Q‚ÇÅ responsive to the absence of periodic pulses actuates an indicator circuit 38 to warn of the faulty operation.
