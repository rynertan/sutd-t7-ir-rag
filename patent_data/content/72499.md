# Process for producing foamed and molded article of polypropylene resin.

## Abstract
A process for producing a foamed and molded article of a polypropylene resin, which comprises pressurizing prelimi narily foamed particles of an ethylene propylene copolymer having a melt index value of from 0.1 to 25, a latent heat of crystallization of not more than 28 cal g and an ethylene content of from 1 to 30 by weight as a base resin with an inorganic gas or a gaseous mixture of the inorganic gas and a volatile blowing agent thereby to impart an elevated pressure to the inside of said particles, thereafter filling said particles in a mold capable of enclosing the particles but allowing escape of gases therefrom, and then heating said particles to expand them to the configuration of the mole.
