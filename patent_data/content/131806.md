# Improved ribbon feed cartridge.

## Abstract
The feeding of typewriter ribbons 20 is improved by utilizing a cartridge carried driving element 46 engaging the periphery of a translatable take up spool 22 where the driv ing element 46 is driven by an interface connection with a driving member connected either directly or through a gear reduction train to a stepper motor. The take up spool 22 is rotatably mounted on a carrier 26 which translates along a guiding channel 30 as the used ribbon is accumulated on the take up spool 22 .
