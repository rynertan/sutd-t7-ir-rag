TITLE OF THE INVENTION Word processorBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to a word processor, and more particularly to a word processor with function of spelling verification for the words entered by keyboard.Description of the Prior Art In recent years, word processors have become available in compacter form and are attaining wider popularity. Particularly so called electronic typewriters have shown remarkable progress with new functions supported by electronic technology, while maintaining the traditional functions of typewriter.One of such new functions is spelling verification which provides the advantage of correcting the text at the entry, as each entered word is verified by a dictionary in the typewriter and any misspelling is immediately informed to the operator. However this function has required a very large memory for the dictionary, thus leading to a higher cost and a larger dimension of the typewriter, and has also required certain time for processing. Also a dictionary containing only ordinary words is unable to handle proper nouns such as human names, and special technical texts, and the verification errors caused in these cases have been rather inconvenient for the operator.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In consideration of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to avoid such drawbacks and to provide a compact and inexpensive word processor with improved performance, in which the capacity of the text memory can be significantly reduced by effective utilization of a dictionary containing ordinary words only. Another object of the present invention is to provide a word processor provided with a control unit for spelling verification and another control unit for word processing. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a word processor with improved operability through effective utilization of a dictionary of ordinary words and through anticipation of entry of proper nouns such as human names. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a word processor in which the capacity of text memory is significantly reduced and operability is improved through effective utilization of a dictionary of ordinary words. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a word processor capable of various operating modes, such as a spelling verify mode for each entered word and a text compression mode by conversion of each word into an identification code, according to the purpose of use, through effective utilization of a dictionary of ordinary words. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a word processor capable of efficiently handling a large amount of text information with a limited memory capacity.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is an external perspective view of an electronic typewriter embodying the present invention Fig. 2 is a front view of an operation panel of said electronic typewriter Fig. 3 is a block diagram of said electronic typewriter Fig. 4 is a functional block diagram of a spelling verify unit SVCU 15 shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 5 a is a conceptional view showing conversion of key entered words into identification codes Fig. 5 b is a conceptional view showing automatic identification of proper nouns such as human names Fig. 5 c is a conceptional view showing a process in case of an error in the key entry Fig. 5 d is a conceptional view showing conversion of text data of identification codes ID in a text buffer Ti into character code data for printing Fig. 6 is a flow chart showing a process when a slide switch on a keyboard 10 is positioned at manual mode MN Fig. 7 is a flow chart showing a process in case the slide switch of the keyboard 10 is positioned at an automatic verify mode AV Fig. 8 is a flow chart showing a process in case the slide switch of the keyboard 10 is positioned at an automatic verify and conversion mode AVC and Fig. 9 is a flow chart showing a process for printing text data stored in the text buffer TB.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Now the present invention will be clarified in detail by embodiments thereof shown in the attached drawings. Fig. 1 is an external perspective view of an electronic typewriter embodying the present invention, wherein a platen knob 1 is used for manual loading of a typewriting sheet or for fine adjustment of the printing position in the vertical direction. When pushed inwards, the platen knob 1 is disengaged from internal coupling with a stepping motor and can be manually rotated. A paper support 2 guides the typewriting sheet and directs the printed texts toward the operator even when a thin paper is used.A page end indicator 3 is a scale indicating the length of paper to the last line of printing, and is vertically adjusted in advance, as indicated by arrows, by the operator according to the length of typewriting sheet, so that the operator can know the length of sheet to the last printing line when the upper end of said sheet reaches the marks on said indicator 3. A elease lever 4 releases pinch rollers, positioned tinder the platen, from said platen and is manipulated .n case the position of the typewriting sheet has to be manually corrected. A noise cover 5, for shielding ibises of impact printing, is composed of a transparent resin so that the printed characters can be seen hrough said cover.Said cover 6 can be opened by rotation to the back, for replacing a ribbon cartridge of changing a type font wheel, mounted on a carriage, a o another font. The present electronic typewriter Provides four printing pitches 10, 12 and 15 ,rharacters per inch, and a proportional spacing in hich the printing pitch is variable according to the wize of each character. A scale 8 has three gradations in 10, 12 and 15 characters per inch. A carriage indicator 7 is composed for example of three lightemitting diodes or lamps, which are mounted on said carriage, and one of the lamps corresponding to the printing pitch selected by the keyboard 10 is light to indicate the position of the carriage on the scale 8.The keyboard 10 is composed of a group of character keys 10a for entering and printing characters, and groups of control keys lob, 10c placed on both sides. Fig. 2 is a front view of an operation panel of the electronic typewriter. A PITCH key is used for selecting the number of characters printed per inch, and in response to actuations of said key, lamps such as light emitting diodes, constituting a display unit L1 are cyclically lighted in the order of 10 , 12 , 15 and PS , wherein the first three represent the number of characters per inch, while PS stands for proportional spacing in which the number of characters per inch is variable according to the characters to be printed. A LINE SPACE key selects the amount of line feed, of which basic unit is 1 6 inches, and lamps of a display unit L2 are cyclically lighted as explained above, in response to the actuations of said key. A KB SELECT key selects a third character on a key which represent three characters, such as a key K III, that cannot be selected by SHIFT key alone. A R.M CONTROL key selects the function of the typewriter at the right end margin, and a display unit L4 cyclically shows JUST,AUTO or OFF in response to the actuations of said key.JUST indicates a mode of right end justification or alignment, while AUTO indicates a mode of automatic line feed, and OFF indicates absence of instruction.An OP CONTROL key selects the printing mode of the electronic typewriter. A mode indicator lamp C,W, L or STORE is lighted in response to the actuation of said key. C indicates printing for every character W indicates printing for every word L indicates printing for every line and STORE indicates storage into a text buffer TB, in which case the printing is effected in the line printing mode L. A MEMORY key is used for processing a text and initiates the function of memory. A margin release key MARREL releases a margin stop state in which the key entry is prohibited, and is also used for releasing in case of a spelling verification error in a word entry to be explained later. A relocation key RELOC is used for repeated spelling verification for a corrected word. A lever switch SSW selects one of three operating modes of the present embodiment.When it is positioned at a manual mode MN, the spelling of a word entered immediately before is verified in response to the actuation of a verify key VER. When it is positioned at an automatic verification mode AV, the spelling of a word is atuomatically verified after it is entered, when the operator actuates the SPACE key. In these two modes, if storage into the internal text buffer is selected in the STORE mode, the character codes of the entered word are stored in the text buffer TB without change. On the other hand, when said lever switch is positioned at an automatic conversion mode AVC, the spelling of a word is automatically verified at the entry of each word, and, at the same time, the character codes of said word is converted into a word identification code ID.In this mode, if the STORE mode is selected, the converted identification code ID is stored in the text buffer TB. Fig. 3 is a block diagram of the electronic typewriter, in which same components as those inFig. 1 are represented by same numbers and will be omitted from the following explanation. In Fig. 3 there are provided a central processing unit CPU 11 performing the main control of the electronic typewriter a read only memory ROM 12 storing the programs, shown in Figs. 6 to 9, to be executed by the CPU 11 a random access memory RAM 12 for temporarily storing text data entered by the keys and other data required for controlling the typewriter a printer unit 14 for printing the text data a spelling verification unit SVCU 15 for verifying the spelling of the key entered words and performing conversion between the character codes and the word identification code and an internal bus line 16 for connecting the above mentioned various units to the CPU 11. It is also possible to communicate data with another electronic typewriter or the like by connecting an unrepresented serial interface to the internal bus line 16. The spelling verification unit SVCU 15 is provided, for achieving complex functions with a simple structure, with a central processing unit CPU 152 for main control a read only memory ROM 153 storing control programs, shown in a part of Figs. 6 to 9, of said CPU 152 a random access memory RAM 154 a dictionary ROM 155 storing the spellings of a very large number of words as a table an internal bus line 156 for connecting the above mentioned units with the CPU 152 and an interface 151 for connecting the entire SVCU 15 to the internal bus line 16 of the typewriter. Fig. 4 is a functional block diagram showing the functions of the spelling verification unit SVCU 15 shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4 there is shown a spelling verification and conversion control unit SVCC 157 which is composed of the CPU 152 and ROM 153 shown in Fig. 3, and which performs control for the spelling verification on the key entered words according to key entered data and other various instruction data supplied from the electronic typewriter through the interface 151, control for conversion from entered words into word identification codesID for forming text data with such identification codes in the text buffer TB, and control for inverse conversion from the identification codes ID read from the text buffer TB into the character codes for printing.For achieving such control functions, theRAM 154 is provided with a character counter CC for counting the number of key entered character data supplied from the electronic typewriter, a word buffer WB for storing the spelling, or the character code data, of a word, a code buffer IDB for storing the word identification codes ID, and a flag bufferIDFB for storing the category of the word. Fig. 4 also shows an example of the dictionary memory 155.As shown in Fig. 4, data for each word consists of the combination of a spelling part SP, a word identification code ID, and an identification flag IDF representing a category code attached to each word, and such data for plural words are stored as a table.Consequently the SVCC 157 can search said dictionary memory 155 by the spelling part SP or by the word identification code ID. In this manner high speed control can be achieved by the use of two control units for spelling verification and for word processing of the entire apparatus. Though the present embodiment is explained with the spelling verification in English language, the same principle can be applied to Japanese, German,French or any other language. The apparatus of this kind is principally used for verifying the spelling of the key entered data, and the apparatus of the present embodiment is for this purpose provided with the above mentioned dictionary memory 155. However, one of the features of the present embodiment is to enable efficient word processing, fully utilizing such dictionary memory. This feature will be further explained in the following explanation. Figs. 5 a d illustrate the function of the present embodiment. Fig. 5 a shows the conversion of a key entered word into a word identification codeID. In response to entries of the character keys of the keyboard 10, corresponding data are supplied, according to the respective purpose of processing, to a line buffer LB of the RAM 13, a display buffer DB of the display unit 9, and a word buffer WB of theSVCU 15. The line buffer LB is used for assembling the data Qf one line, while the display buffer DB is used for displaying 20 characters, and the word bufferWB is used for extracting a word for search in the dictionary or for spelling verification. The use of such word buffer WB for spelling verification independent from the line buffer LB and test buffer TB allows high speed and independent word processing and spelling verification.In a mode of the present embodiment, a word is detected by the actuation of the SPACE key. Thus, in case a word wAn followed by the SPACE key is entered, the character counter CC counts the number of characters 2 1 of said word, and the word buffer WB stores the spelling, or character codes, of said word. The SVCC 157 makes a search with said character code data in the dictionary memory 155, and a coinciding word An is found in the spelling part SP shown in Fig. 4. Thus a corresponding word identification code ID 0023H H stands for hexadecimal is stored in the buffer IDB while the category code IDF A is stored in the flag bufferIDFB. The code A indicates the presence of the searched word in the dictionary, meaning that the identification code 0023H in the buffer IDB is effective.The CPU 11 of the electronic typewriter transfers the content of said buffer IDB to the text buffer TB, and, the entered character data can therefore be stored into shorter word identification codes.Similar procedures are conducted for the ensuing words electronic SPACE and thermometer SPACE It is to be noted that the original key entered data of 26 characters or 26 bytes are reduced to 12 digits or 6 bytes when stored in the text buffer TB. Fig. 5 b shows automatic identification of proper nouns such as human names or symbols and marks. In general, human names cannot be adapted to search in dictionary. In the present embodiment, therefore, useless spelling verification is omitted for the entry of human names or the like. For this purpose it is required to anticipate the entry of a human name, since, otherwise, the human name may be identified after unnecessary search in the dictionary.In the present embodiment, therefore, it is rendered possible to identify certain abbreviations which usual precede human names. For example, if a word Mr. is identified in the dictionary memory 155 shown in Fi . 4, the succeeding word should be a human name.Thus, in order to achieve the above explained control, a category code C is given to the identification flagIDF oi said word Mr. in the present embodiment. A similar process can be conveniently applied by giving the same category code C to similar words such as Mrs. , Dr. etc. Also this concept can be easily applied to other word than proper nouns. Now referring to Fif. 5 b , after the search of the word Mr. in the dictionary memory, the CPU 11 of the electronic typewriter identifies the identification flag C in the flag buffer IDFB to automatically exclude the following wqr from verification or code conversion.In such operating mode, it becomes necessary to store text data already converted into the word identification codes and unconverted text data, mixedly in the text buffer TB. Thus, in case of storing unconverted text data such as the above explained proper nouns, in the text buffer TB, the CPU 11 attaches a particular mark 1 , then inserts the content of the character counter CC in order to indicate the number of characters, and finally stores the character codes of the spelling without through the buffer IDB. Fig. 5 c shows the procedure in case of an erroneous key entry. In the illustraged example, the first search in the dictionary provides a negative result since the word stabirization is misspelled and letter r should be 1 . This result is indicated by IDF F, wherein category F is given by the SVCC 157 which has detected the absence of the subject word in the dictionary. In response the CPU 11 of the electronic typewriter inverts the display of said word in the display buffer DB, and applies a temporary margin stop to the keyboard 10, thus forbidding the further movement of the cursor to the right, thus drawing attention of the operator. For this purpose there may also be employed flashing of the display or other suitable method.In this state the operator can return the cursor to the left, and is therefore capable of returning the cursor to the position of Hr and correcting it to 1 . After the correction the operator actuates the RELOC key, whereby the search in the dictionary is effected again and a word identification code ID a 435 and a category code IDF A are respectively transferred to the buffers IDB, IDFB. At this point the CPU 11 transfers the content of IDB to the text buffer TB. Fig. 5 d shows a state of converting text data consisting of the word identification codes ID in the text buffer TB into character code data for printing. At first the word identification codes ID of the text buffer TB are transferred to the code buffer IDB in the RAM 154 of the SVCC. Then the CPU 11 supplies the SVCC 157 with an instruction for reverse conversion, whereby the SVCC 157 searches the dictionary memory 155 with a code ID 4C35 and stores a corresponding word stabilization in the word buffer WB. Subsequently the CPU 11 transfers these character codes to the print buffer PB for printing the characters in succession. Manual mode As explained above, the apparatus of the present embodiment is provided with converting means from character data to identification code data and converting means from identification code data into character data, and is thus capable of storing text data in the text buffer TB in the form of shorter word identification codes ID. It is therefore rendered possible to significantly reduce the size of the text buffer, or to store a larger amount of text data in the text buffer of a given capacity. Also communication with another electronic typewriter or the like can be made very efficiently, since the text of a page can be transmitted very quickly because of the shorter length of data. Figs. 6 to 8 are flow charts showing the control procedure of the CPU 11 in three operating modes of the present embodiment, wherein Fig. 6 shows the control procedure in case the lever switch on the keyboard 10 is positioned at the manual mode MN. A manual verify MV program is selected and activated in the ROM 12 by a mode selection signal from the keyboard 10 shown in Fig. 3. In this operating mode, the spelling verification is not conducted by the actuation of the SPACE key, but is conducted, in response to the actuation of the VER key, for an immediately preceding word. This operating mode allows key entries at high speed and is practically convenient since the verification can be selected only when needed, for example when the operator cannot be confident with the key entry operation. The VER key also has a function of forcedly dividing a word, and can therefore be utilized for cutting a word at an arbitrary position. Referring to Fig. 6, a step M1 awaits a key entry. A subsequent step M2 identifies if the VER key has been actuated. If not, the program proceeds to a step M3 for key input process, for example transferring the entered character code to the line buffer LB, display buffer DB and word buffer WB, or executing insertion, deletion, cursor movement etc. in response to a word processing key input. In case the VER key is actuated, the program proceeds to a step M4 to supply the SVCC157 with a start SVC 1 instruction, and a step M5 awaits the completion of process in theSVCC 157. The process executed by the CPU 152 of theSVCC is represented by steps S1 and S2.The step S1 performs a search of the content of the word buffer WB in the dictionary memory 155, and the step S2 transfers a corresponding identification flag IDF to the flag buffer IDFB. When a step M5 identifies that theSVCC is no longer busy, a step M6 inspects whether the flag buffer IDFB contains a flag F. If the content is not F, indicating the presence of the searched word, the program proceeds to a step M7 for releasing an instruction of SVC resetting, whereby the CPU 152 of the SVCC executes steps S3 and S4 to resets the character counter CC and the word bufferWB. Subsequently, in a step M8, the CPU 11 of the electronic typewriter executes a margin release to enable the movement of the cursor, and the program returns to the step M1 for awaiting the key entry. On the other hand, if the step M6 identifies the content of the flag buffer IDFB as F, indicating the absence of the searched word, the program proceeds to a step M9 to apply a margin step, thus preventing the cursor from further advancement.However the cursor can be reversed for certain process. A succeeding step M10 identifies if there has been actuated the margin release key MAR REL.The actuation of said margin release key indicates that the program should proceed to the entry of a next word, without being bothered with the spelling of said searched word. Thus the cursor movement is enabled and the program proceeds to the step M7.On the other hand, if said margin release key MAR REL has not been actuated, a step Mll identifies whether the relocation key RELOC has been actuated. If said relocation key has been actuated, the dictionary memory is searched again. This procedure corresponds to the case of re verification after a correction in the spelling. If the relocation key RELOC has not been actuated either, a step M12 executes a key input process, such as a cursor movement, a character insertion or deletion or conversion for correcting the erroneous spelling. As explained in the foregoing, this operating mode allows the operator to verify the spelling at an arbitrary timing.Automatic verification model Fig. 7 is a flow chart showing the process when the lever switch of the keyboard 10 is positioned at an automatic verify mode AV. An automatic verify program AV is selected in the ROM 12 by a mode selection signal from the keyboard 10 shown in Fig. 3.In this operating mode, the spelling verification is automatically executed for each word, identified by the actuation of the SPACE key. Also in this operating mode, the spelling verification is conducted, in response to the actuation of the verification keyVER by the operator, for a word entered immediately before. In this case said VER key has a function of forcedly dividing a word independently from the SPACE key, and can be conveniently used for dividing a word at an arbitrary position. Reference is now made to Fig. 7, in which same steps as those in Fig. 6 are represented by same symbols and will be omitted from the following explanation. As explained before, the spelling verification in the automatic verify mode AV is conducted for every word, which is identified by detecting the actuation of the SPACE key. Thus, a step Al identifies if the SPACE key has been actuated, and, if not, the program returns to the step M1 for awaiting next key entry. On the other hand, if the SPACE key has been actuated, the program proceeds to a step A2 for identifying whether the flag buffer IDFB contains a flag C.If a flag C is present, indicating that the SVCC 157 has identified the immediately preceding word as a determined abbreviation preceding for example a human name, the program proceeds to a step A3 which returns the content of the flag bufferIDFB to A without any spelling verification, since the human name immediately following said abbreviation is not suitable for search in the dictionary. However certain proper nouns, for example names of places such as Tokyo, can be processed in the same manner as ordinary words. If the flag C is absent in the stepA2, indicating that the entered word is an ordinary word, the program proceeds to a step M4 to thereafter follow the same flow as explained in relation toFig. 6. The data transfer to the text buffer TB in the present operating mode is effected by accumulating character code data of a line in the line buffer LB. Though not illustrated, it is also possible to dispense with the spelling verification for any word with a certain number of characters or less, since the errors in spelling are quite few in the shorter words such as an , I , he etc. Such control can be realized with a criterion that the number of characters does not exceed a certain value. Automatic verification and conversion mode Fig. 8 is a flow chart showing the process when the lever switch of the keyboard 10 is positioned at the automatic verification and conversion mode AVC.In this mode, an AVC program is selected in the ROM 12 and activated by a mode selection signal from the keyboard 10 shown in Fig. 3. Referring to Fig. 8, same steps as those in Figs. 6 and 7 are represented by same symbols and will be omitted from the following description. In this operating mode, the spelling verification is automatically effected for any word, which is identified by the actuation of the SPACE key, and the word confirmed by verification is converted into a corresponding identification code ID and stored in the text buffer TB. Also as in the foregoing modes, in response to the actuation of the VER key by the operator, characters entered immediately before are considered as a word and the spelling verification is effected for said word. One of the features of this operating mode is that, in case a step A2 identifies an immediately preceding word as a certain abbreviation which preceds a human name, the program proceeds to a step C1 to transfer a symbol , the content of the character counter CC and the content of the word buffer WB to the text buffer TB. Since human name cannot be converted into an identification code, it is stored in the text buffer in the form of character codes. The mark , and the number of characters are attached in order to facilitate later recognition by the CPU 11. As explained before, popular names of places or the like can be incorporated in the dictionary memory 155 since they can be searched in the dictionary.Also the dictionary memory 155 may partly contain a random access memory for registering suitable data by the operator. Another feature of this operating mode is that, when a step ME identifies that the flag buffer does not contain F, meaning that the searched word has been found in the dictionary, the program proceeds to a step C2 to transfer the word identification codeID in the buffer IDB to the text buffer TB. For this purpose, a step T1 executed by the CPU 152 of the SVCC transfers the identification code ID of the word, confirmed by verification in the dictionary, to the buffer IDB. With the progress of the key entry process in this manner, the text buffer TB will contain text data consisting assembled character codes and identification codes ID obtained by code conversion. Print mode Fig. 9 is a flow chart showing the process of printing the text data stored in the text bufferTB. A step P1 reads data of 1 byte from the text buffer TB. Then a step P2 identifies whether said data consist of a particular code . If so, the text buffer TB contains data on the number of characters and data on the word. Thus a step P3 reads the data on the number of characters, then a step P4 reads character codes of said number and a step P5 transfers the data of thus read word to the print buffer PB. The data thus transferred into the print buffer PB are printed according to another unrepresented program of the electronic typewriter.A step Pll inspects an end code to identify whether the entire text data are processed, and, if not, the program returns to the step P1. On the other hand, if the entire text data have been processed, the printing routine is terminated. In case the particular code is not found in the step P2, a step P6 reads a succeeding identification code of 1 byte, and a step P7 transfers it to the buffer IDB of the SVCU 15. Then a step P8 releases an instruction start SVCC 3 , and a stepP9 awaits the completion of execution by the SVCC 157.On the other hand, a step U1 executed by the CPU 152 of the SVCC 157 performs a search of the identification code ID in the dictionary, and, upon finding a coinciding code, reads the spelling SP of a corresponding word, and a step U2 transfers said spelling to the word buffer WB. When a step P9 identifies that the SVCC is no longer busy, the CPU 152 of the electronic typewriter transfers, in a stepP10, the content of the word buffer WB to the print buffer PB. The content of the word buffer WB can also be transferred to the display buffer for display on the display unit 9. As explained in the foregoing, the present invention not only allows to significantly reduce the capacity of text memory but also is easily adaptable to the word processing of specific or technical fields through the use of a dictionary of ordinary words, since the words present in said dictionary are stored after conversion into word identification codes of shorter length while the words not present in said dictionary are stored in the form of characters. Also the present invention provides a word processor an improved cost performance, since a dictionary memory can be used in various modes by switch means according to the purpose of use, such as a spelling verification mode for every entered word, or a compression mode for text information by conversion into word identification codes. Furthermore the present invention allows to significantly reduce the capacity of the text memory by converting each key entered word into a shorter identification code of a determined length for storage in the text memory, and it is therefore rendered possible to realize a smaller dimension and a lower cost for example in case of providing a conventional electronic typewriter with a spelling verification function. Furthermore the present invention allows to store text information of a large amount into the memory of a limited capacity, and such storage is advantageous for data storage in an external memory medium and realizes data communication with another equipment within a shorter time. Furthermore the present invention enables to dramatically improve the operability of the apparatus, since words not present in the dictionary, particularly proper nouns such as human names are automatically distinguished and excluded from the spelling verification. Furthermore the present invention allows to significantly reduce the capacity of text memory and to improve the operability, even through the use of a dictionary containing ordinary words only, since the words present in said dictionary are converted into identification codes of a determined length and stored, while the words not present in said dictionary, particularly proper nouns such as human names are automatically distinguished and stored in the form of character codes It is further rendered possible to provide an apparatus with improved operability, through the use of separate control units for the word processing and for the spelling verification, thus exploiting maximum functions thereof at a high speed.
