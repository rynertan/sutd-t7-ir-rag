# Tube extractor drill jig.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a drill jig assembly for use in the removing a tube from a wall structure. The device fits within the tube and defines drill guide grooves along its length such that, a rotating drill inserted into the guide grooves will cut away a portion of the wall thickness of the tube. When portions of the tubing wall thickness have been reduced, the tube may be readily inwardly collapsed so as to easily remove it from the wall structure.
