# MULTI LAYER HEAT BARRIER

## Abstract
A heat barrier comprises a plurality of layers 2 each of which is formed by a substrate of expanded metal mesh foil 3 which is coated with a heat actuated and resistive intumescent coating. In order to enable rapid and simultaneous intumes cence of the coatings on the substrate layers in the event of a fire the layers on the outer side of the barrier comprise sub strate meshes which have an aperture size greater than the ap erture size of the substrate meshes on the other side or in the centre of the barrier.
