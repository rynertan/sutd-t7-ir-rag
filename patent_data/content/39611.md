# Vacuum interrupter.

## Abstract
A vacuum circuit interrupter for electric power having a vacuum vessel 12 into which a pair of electrode holders 15, 16 each having an electrode contact 18, 19 brazed to the end thereof are in contact with each other when the circuit is closed and are separated from each other when the circuit is open, the vacuum vessel comprising a an insulating envelope 12 made of a ceramic or crystallized glass having a metallized layer 12a at each end thereof b a first metallic end plate 13 made of copper to the periphery of which one metallized layer of the insulating envelope is brazed c a second metallic end plate 14 made of copper to the periphery of which the other metal lized layer of the insulating envelope is brazed d an arc shielding member 20 located within the insulating envelope so as to surround the pair of electrode contacts 18, 19 and be brazed to the second metallic end plate 14 at one end thereof and e a bellows 17 located within the arc shielding member 20 brazed to the electrode holder 16 at one end thereof and to the second metallic end plate 14 , at the other end thereof, whereby both first and second metallic end plates 13, 14 are made of copper, and are annealed during the brazing operation so that they are easily deformed plastically, whereby thermal stress gener ated between the end plates and the insulating envelope is absorbed into these plastically deformable end plates and the insulating envelope and brazed joints are not destroyed.
