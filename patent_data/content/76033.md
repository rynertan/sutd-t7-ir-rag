## Description
DESCRIPTION PUt S this invention relates to oil pUIips for internal combustion engines. The output requirenent fror an oil pump is maximum when the engine is at raxijtur speed load.It is customary to design an oil pump to deliver the required lubricant flow under such conditions, and then when the engine is idling, the pump output is probably too great, and the surplus lubricant is returned to the oil sump by weans of son,e vent, presure relief valve or th like. Inevitably this means that the pump wastes energy. In the past, there was a low awareness of energy absorbtion with internal combustion engine arrangements, and small losses were considered to be unimportant. with increasing fuel costs and exhaustion of fossil fuel resources, there is a much greater awareness, and it is or may now be economical to produce special designs of oil pups which at least reduce power wastage. The object of the present invention is to provide such an oil purp. In accordance with the present invention, a gerotor pump of the n and n l kind comprises a rotor common to at least a pair of axially juxtaposed annuli, and the annuli being located in individual and corresponding eccentric mounting rings, and means being provided for turning said rings in opposite directions whereby the effective size of the pursing chambers provided between the respective lobes of the rotor and annuli llaay be varied. In the situation where the annuli and rings are wholly aligned so that their axes are co axial, the pumping charters will be of a maximum effective size. Where one cf the rings is turned relative to the other, for exarple by taking it in the fashion of a knows reversing riny and turning it to the reversed position, a maximum size chamber between the one annulus and the rotor will tMe aligned with G r inilr,ur size chanber between the other annulus and the rotor.This not only reduces the volume of this charber, tut because the reverse situation will apply at a different points around the gyratory path, it will tean that the punping effect will be substantially reduced. However, it has been found if one annuli is in fixed and invariable position relative to the inlet and outlet ports and the other annuli is turned, e.g. towards the reverse position, that whilst the charter volumes are varied and the theoretical pupping output is reduced, there are undesirable side effects. These are in the nature of noise during running of the pump, and it is anticipated that the noise is indicative of unsatisfactory pressure conditions within the pup which are likely to cause wear er darage if allowed to continue. In a sirple gerotor pump with a single annulus, a series of chanbers exist between the respective lobes, and these chambers increase in volume fro a rinirum to a maximum and then return to that minimum as the parts turn. The inlet and outlet ports are located so that cil is drawn in by the increasing volume of. the chanbers and expelled by the decreasing volume of the chambers.If the ports were not apprepriately situated, reducing volume of the chambers will nct be associated with an outlet port and because the oil is effcctivcly incompressible, the trappeci cil in the chamber causes the nowise referre l tc. It will be seen that hy turning one ring relative to the ether, so that half the axial length of each chanber is as described but the other half follows a different pattern because of the turning, there is the possibility that some oil entrapment ray occur.It is for this reason that the invention is restricted t the requirement that the annuli are to be turned in opposite directions with the intention of effectively cancelling out such an undesirable effect. However, it is not considered essential that the annuli are to be turned to equal distances in opposite directions, and some variation can be obtained by appropriate length of inlet and outlet ports, and some degree of entrapment is acceptable. In experimental conditions, it has been fcund that by turning the two annuli thrcugh equal angle to a maxillur, substantial reductions in flow rate and in torque and hence energy absorbtion are possible. In a preferred arrangement a variable volume oil pump for an i.c. engine has the two rings coupled together for noverrent in opposite directions.This may be done automatically and proportionally within limits to engine speed and load, and one way cf achieving this, for example, is by the use of governor devices, in a manner analogous to that employed with autcFatic advance retard rechanisr.s for i.c. ignition systems. The invention is now more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings z7herein Figure 1 is a part sectional perspective view of a variable displacement pump according to the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged sectional elevation of the same in a raximun volume position and Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 2 but showing the same in a reduced volurle delivery position. Turning now to Figure 1, the gerotor pump is there illustrated with a cover, normally held in place by screws engaged in holes 10, removed to reveal the rotors and punting charibers. The inner rotor 12 has n lobes and is fast with drive shaft 14. The rotor 12 extends cver the full width of two annuli 16 18 which are like, and each has n l lobes. Each of the rotors 16 18 is eccentric to the shaft 14 axis, and lies in a corresponding eccentric ring 20 22. then the eccentric rings are aligned then annuli 16 18 are aligned and an end elevation will appear as in Figure 2. The eccentric rings 20 22 are provided with gear teeth and both sets cf teeth are meshed with a common pinion 24, and when that pinicn is rotated about its axis, the two eccentric rings are turned in opposite directions and hence shift the respective positions of the annuli 16 18. Figure 3 shows the parts in a shifted position. The position of the inlet and outlet ports is shown in Figures 2 and 3 with the reference numerals 26 28. Effectively, it is the progression past the inlet port of a series of interlobe chambers which increase in volume as they pass the port which induces puin flow from the inlet port into those chambers, and likewise it is the progression of ttosc charbers past the outlet port whilst the charbers are decreasing in volure which causes the pumping flew through the outlet t crt. The total volume of the chambers as well as the rate of change of volure affects thc pumping rate.It will be seen by comparison of figures 2 and 3 that in Figure 3 the chambers are effectively of smaller volute because of the relative displacement of the annuli and hence the volure purped is reduced. The pinion 24 is arranged to be rctated, in this embodiment, by a rack 30 which flay be driven by pressure derived fro any of a nurber of different places in the pump or in the engine for example to which the pump is fitted. The pinion is preferably urged by a torsion spring so that when pressure falls the pinion automatically reverses its direction and returns the annuli towards the aligned position. Figure 1 illustrates an arrangement in which pressure in the outlet port of the pump itself is connected via passage 32 and by way of a filter to act on piston 34 for displacing the rack 30. If a corparatively external pressure source is to be utilised, the passage 32 may be blocked.
