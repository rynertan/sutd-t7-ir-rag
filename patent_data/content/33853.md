# Manganese dioxide light metal cell with organic electrolyte.

## Abstract
A cell composed of an anode with a light metal as an active material, a cathode with manganese dioxide as an active material, and an organic electrolyte. The cathode contains an alkaline earth metal oxide. The cell is superior in storage with the swelling of the cell and the increase of the cell impedance is little during the preservation.
