# Adhesion of polyurethane elastomer to metal.

## Abstract
Problems with conventional techniques of adhering a polyurethane elastomer to metal, for example insufficient strength of adhesion between the elastomer and metal in the resulting article, are overcome by coating the metal surface with a first composition comprising a polyepoxy compound and a polyamine compound, drying the coating of the first composition, coating the dried coating of the first composi tion with a second composition comprising an isocyanate compound having a concentrate of isocyanate groups of 15 50 by weight, drying the coating of the second composi tion, casting the precursor components for the polyurethane elastomer onto the dried coating of the second composition and hardening the cast precursor components to form the polyurethane elastomer.
