# Printed circuit edge connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connection of the kind arranged to receive an edge of a printed circuit board or the like to make a plurality of electrical connections thereto. The connector includes a body 11 having an end face, and within the body are a plurality of parallel passages 12 which extend from the end face for receiving respective electrical terminals. The partition walls 19 which separate the passages from one another, each have therein a slot 21 for accommodating the edge of the printed circuit board or the like in use. At least one of the slots 21a is so positioned in relation to the other slots 21 and the shape of the board to be received, that in order for the edge of the board to be received in each of the slots 21 , 21a the board and or the body must be flexed from its rest configuration whereby after insertion of the board the inherent resilience of the flexed board and or body 11 causes the edges of the slot or slots 21, 21a to grip the board.

## Description
DESCRIPTION ELECTRICAL CO NECTOR This invention relates to an electrical connector of the kind arranged to receive an edge of a printed circuit board or the like and to make a plurality of electrical connections thereto. A problem which is found with electrical connectors of the kind specified is that the printed circuit board is a loose fit in the connector and can be disturbed by vibration in use to the detriment of the electrical connections.It is an object of the present invention to provide an electrical connector wherein this problem is minimized. According to the invention an electrical connector of the kind specified includes a body hav.ing an end face, and a plurality of passages extending into said body from said end face for receiving respective electrical terminals the partition walls defining the passages each having therein a slot for accommodating the edge of the printed circuit board in use, so that the board can engage the terminals received in the passages in use, ad at least one oi said slots being so positioned in relation to the other slots and the shape of the board to be received, that in order for the edge of the board to be reeved by each of the slots, the board and or the body must be flexed from its rest con figuration whereby after insertion of the board, the inherent resilience of the flexed board and or body causes the edges of said slot or slots to grip the board. It is to be understood that the term printed circuit board or the like includes a flexible printed circuit supported on a plate like carrier, arid is also intended to include non printed arrangements of a similar nature for example, a board or p ate having conductive leads thereon the ends of which are bored and bznd around the edges of the plate or board, and a plate or board carrying str.p like terminals at its edges. Preferably the connector is intended for use with a planar board and the passages are thus co planar, the slots being co planar with the exception of ths two outermost slots which are displaced in position to the same side of the plane of the other slots. One example of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is an end elevational view of an electrical connector Figure 2 is a plan view of the connector shorn inFigure 1 Figure 3 is a diagrammatic end elevational view to an eiilarged scale of a part of the connector shown in Figure 1 and Figure 4 is an enlarged view of a terminal utilised in the connector of Figure 1. Referring to the drawing, the electrical connector includes a moulded synthetic resin body 11 having therein a plurality of passages 12 of rectangular cross section. The passages 12 are parallel and co pla Iar, and each open at an end face 13 of the body 11, the passages 12 extending at right angles to the end face 13. Each of the passages receives an electrical terminal 14 having deformable tags 15, 16 whereby the terminal is erectrically and physically connected to a conductive lead in use. Each of the terminals 14 includes a pair of resilient arms 17 between which a planar component can be gripped, the torminal making electrical connection to the planar compolzent. Each of the terminals 14 is received in a respective passage 12 with its arms 17 extending towards the end face 13 of the body.Each terminal includes a latch 18 which in use co operates with a shoulder within the respective passage to resist movement of the terminal 14 relative to the body in a direction away from the end face 13. The electrical connector is intended to make elec irical connection to an edge region of a printed circuit board. The printed circuit board is planar, and has a plurality of exposed contact regions adjacent one edge theThe contat regions are equal in number to the passages and therefore terminals 14 of tile body 11. Ill order that the printed circuit board may be inser ted into the body 11 sufficiently far to engage the edge region of tlie printed circuit board between the arms 17 of the terminals 14 the partition walls 19 of the body which define between them the passages 12 are formed with slots 21 of width sufficient to accommodate the thickness of the printed circuit board. The positioning of the slots 21 is such that the board when accommodated by the slots 21 is engaged between the limbs 17 of the terminals 14. In order that the body 11 firmly grips the printed circuit board the slots 21a of tlie two end partition walls 1ga are offset from the plane of the remaining slot 21. The two slots.21a are offset in the same direction from the plant of the remaining slots 21 and thus in order for the printed circuit bcard to be engaged in the body it is necessary for the printed circuit board to be flexed froiii its norlnal planar configuration so as to engage simultaneously in the slots 21 and 21a. Upon release of the printed circuit board after insertion into the slots 21, 21a the inherent resilience of the printed circuit tending to restore the printed circuit board to its planar configuration, causes the printed circuit board to bear tightly against the walls of the slots 21 21a so that the printed circuit board is gripped in tile body. It will te understood that in some constructions the flexure necessary to introduce the printed circuit board into the slots of the partition walls could be flexure of the body or flexure of both the body and the printed circuit board. Furthermore, while in tRie construction described the two outcrnlost slots 21a are displaced it is to be understood other slots could be displaced in addition to, or instead of the outermost slots. The displacement of the chose, is in excess of the clearance between the width of th slo and the thickness of the board. It is to be understood that while a printed circui board has been referred to above, the connect can be use with a flexible printed circuit supported on a panel or tht like, and with arrangements of a similar nature such as boards having the bared ends of conductive leads bent around an edge thereof and boards having strip like terminals clip ped or otherwise secured at an edge thereof. In all of the arrangements envisaged above, some means will be provided for locating the printed circuit board laterally relative to the body so that the terminals received within the passages engage the appropriate conductive regious of the printed circuit board or the L.ike. For example the body can be provided vith a wall or walls which engage an edge or edges of the pinted circuit beard to ensure correct lateral location.
