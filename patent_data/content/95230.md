# Apparatus for facilitating the operation of a view finder.

## Abstract
The trunnion bearing assemblies of a view finder 18 for a television camera 11 are provided with brake assemblies 42, 63 to hold the view finder in any chosen inclination or position, while yet permitting easy manual change of inclination and position. A pair of such brake assemblies may be arranged at the ends of an intermediate linking element 23 to define with the camera and the view finder a Z type configuration for extending the position and inclination ranges of the view finder.
