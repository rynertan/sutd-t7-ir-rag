# Fixing of tetra hydrocarbyl borate salt imaging systems.

## Abstract
Imaging systems comprising a tetra hydrocarbyl bo rate and a bleachable dye may be rendered desensitizable by the inclusion of a second bleachable dye which absorbs radiation in a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum than the first bleachable dye.
