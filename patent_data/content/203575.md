# Control of ignition timing upon occurence of abnormality in a reference crank angle position sensing system.

## Abstract
A method of controlling ignition timing of an internal combustion engine when an abnormality develops in a sys tem for sensing a reference crank angle position of a crankshaft of the engine, in which the timing at which an ignition coil starts and stops conducting is controlled on the basis of a first pulse signal generated once per at least two revolutions of the crankshaft at a predetermined crank angle position associated with a particular cylinder of the engine, a second pulse signal indicative of a predetermined reference crank angle position of the crankshaft for each cy linder, and a third pulse signal indicative of a predeter mined angular position of the crankshaft. The method com prises the steps of sensing an abnormality in the reference crank angle position sensing system for sensing the prede termined reference crank angle position, generating a pseudo signal pulse having a predetermined pulse width in place of the second pulse signal on the basis of the first and third pulse signals when the second pulse signal fails to be generated because of the abnormality in the reference crank angle position sensing system, starting conduction of the ignition coil at a leading edge of the pseudo signal pulse, and stopping conduction of the ignition coil at a trail ing edge of the pseudo signal pulse.
