# Solar cell device.

## Abstract
A solar cell device comprises first and second photoac tive materials 1, 2 deposited on opposite sides of a transparent insulating substrate 3 . The first photoactive material 1 has a larger energy bandgap than that of the second photoactive material 2 and the first photoactive material is responsive to light of different wavelengths to those of the light to which the second photoactive material is responsive. A metal layer 4 formed on the second photoac tive material reflects light back through the structure and may extend around the edge of the substrate to electrically connect the solar cell on one side of the substrate to the solar cell on the other side of the substrate. A metallic grid 5 forms an ohmic contact to the first photoactive material. The solar cells may be of the P N junction or Schottky barrier types.
