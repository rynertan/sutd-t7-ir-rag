# Semiconductor device having a polycrystalline thin film.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes a polycrystalline semi conductor film body having at least one element selected from hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium included mainly around the grain boundaries of the polycrystalline semicon ductor film in a content of 100 ppm to 40 based on atomic ratio. The simultaneous inclusion of one of halogen elements and one of hydrogen and the monovalent metal elements is more effective to quench charges of the elements included. The inclusion of the elements improves the electronic characteristics of the polycrystalline semiconductor film which may form part, for example, of a field effect transistor, a solar cell or a diode.
