No compounds which have 3 oxo 1,4 benzothiazine as the main skeletal structure have been practically used as medicines acting on the cardiovascular system. As compounds of this type having pharmacological actions on the cardiovascular system, those having a substituted phenyl group at the 2 position are disclosed in EuropeanPatent Application Laid Open No. 0116368A1 referring to their platelet aggregation inhibitory and calcium antagonistic action and those having a group represented RÚ by N at the 2 position wherein RÚ and Rê may form a Rê heterocyclic ring together with the adjacent nitrogen atom are disclosed in Japan Patent Application Laid OpenNo. 59 170081 170081 84 referring to their diuretic and hypotensive action respectively, and no further disclosure has yet been found. However, 3 oxo 1,4 benzothiazine derivatives have many fields to be explored, and as to a compound having, through analkylene group, a substituent, especially 4phenyl l piperazinyl group, at the 2 position and p.harm cological actions thereof, nothing has been known at all This invention relates to novel 1,4 benzothiazine derivatives having excellent pharmacological action among others, strong antihypertensive and vasodilating activities.More specifically, this invention relates to 1 1,4 Benzothiazine derivatives I of the formula EMI2.1 wherein RÚ and Rê independently stand for hydrogen, halogen, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group or trifluoromethyl group, or RÚ and Rê, taken together, form a 5 7 membered ring represented byEMI2.2 wherein n is an integer of 3 to 5 or a 5 6 membered ring represented byEMI2.3 wherein misl or 2, R3 and R4 independently stand for hydrogen, halogen, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group or trifluoromethyl group, R5 stands for hydrogen or a lower alkyl group, and A stands for an alkylene group as well as acid addition salts thereof, 2 A process for producing the 1,4 benzothiazine derivatives I and 3 A pharmaceutical composition characteristically featured by containing the 1,4 benzothiazine derivatives I In the above formula I , the substituents represented by RÚ, Rê, R and R4 may be the same or different and be present at any optional position of the benzene ring.The halogen as an example of such substituents may be fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine and is preferably 3 4 fluorine or chlorine. When R and R are halogen, especially fluorine, at least one of them is preferably present at the 4 position of the benzene ring. The lower alkyls are preferably those having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and are exemplified by methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec butyl and t butyl, and especially those having 1 3 carbon atoms are preferable, when RÚ and Rê are lower alkyls adjacent to each other, they may be combined to form a 5 7 membered ring represented byEMI3.1 wherein n is an integer of 3 to 5. The group CH2 n is exemplified by trimethylene, tetramethylene or pentamethylene. As the lower alkoxys are preferable those having 1 3 carbon atoms, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or isopropoxy.When R1 and R2 are adjacent to each other, they may be combined with each other to form a 5 6 membered ring represented byEMI3.2 wherein misl or 2. The groupEMI3.3 is exemplified by methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy. The lower alkyl shown by R5 is a group of C1 4 mentioned above, especially C1 3 ones are preferable. The alkylene designated by A is preferably a group of C14 which may be straight chain or branched, for example, methylene, methylmethylene, ethylene, propylene, trimethylene, l methyltrimethylene, 2 methyltrimethylene or tetramethylene. Especially, C2 3 ethylene and trimethylene are preferable. A compound of this invention representable by the formula I can be easily prepared by for example allowing a compound 11 of the formula EMI4.1 wherein X stands for a leaving group, and the other symbols are of the same meaning as defined above, to react with a compound III of the formula EMI4.2 wherein all the symbols are of the same meaning as defined above. In the formula II , the leaving group designated byX is exemplified by halogen e.g. chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc. , alkylsulfonyloxy e.g. methylsulfonyloxy, ethylsulfonyloxy, etc. or arylsulfonyloxy e.g. phenylsulfonyloxy, tolylsulfonyloxy, etc. . This reaction is conducted by allowing a compound II to react with a compound III . This reaction can be conducted in a solvent inert to the reaction under heating, or by heating a mixture of them in the absence of a solvent. In either case, the reaction temperature ranges from about 60 C to about 2000C, more preferably from about 800C to about 150 C. The solvent is exemplified by alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, 2 propanol, butanol and 2 methoxyethanol, ethers such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene. and xylene, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, pyridine, N,N dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, etc., and a mixture of these solvents.As an acid attributable to the leaving group X is produced in this reaction, the reaction can be conducted in the presence of a suitable acid acceptor such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or triethylamine, or the reaction is allowed to proceed smoothly by adding an excess amount of III which is allowed to act also as an acid acceptor. The amount of III is usually 1 3 mol. relative to 1 mole of II , and the amount of an acid acceptor is preferably 1 3 mol.relative to 1 mole of II . A compound I wherein R is a lower. alkyl can be produced by subjecting a compound I wherein R5is hydrogen to alkylation. This alkylation is conducted by reacting an alkylating agent in an organic solvent in the presence of a base. The solvent to be used varies with the kinds of bases employed, and is exemplified by alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane or diethyl ether, N,N dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, etc. The base to be used is exemplified by sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium t butoxide, sodium hydride, pottasium hydride, sodium amide, etc., and the alkylating agent to be used is exemplified by an alkyl halide e.g. chloride, bromide, iodide, etc. , dialkylsulfate, alkylsulfonate e.g. methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, etc. . For conducting this reaction, it is preferable to allow a compound I R5 is hydrogen to react with a base in a solvent to form an anion and then to allow the resultant anion to react with an alkylating agent. The reaction temperature ranges usually from lQ C to about 1000C, preferably from about OOC to about 400C. If required, 1,4 benzothiazine derivatives I can be led to acid addition salts thereof. These salts are exemplified by inorganic salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate or phosphate, organic acid salts such as acetate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, malate, fumarate, maleate or tartrate, and sulfonates such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate or toluenesulfonate. The 1,4 benzothiazine derivatives I as well as salts thereof are novel compounds and display strong vasodilating activity, noradrenaline receptor blocking activity, hypotensive activity due to intracellular calcium antagonism, activity of ameliorating cerebral circulation, etc. in mammals e.g. rat, rabbit, dog, cat and man .Especially, it is a great characteristic feature of the compounds of this invention that they display intracellular calcium antagonism. Contraction of smooth muscle requires the calcium ion Ca , and this Ca includes 1 that which flows in the cells through the so called Ca channel, 2 that which is liberated from the intracellular Ca store site, and 3 that which flows in the cells through the receptor dependent channel. A Ca channel blocker such as nifedipine hardly acts on 2 and 3 .As the compounds acting on 2 and showing antagonism against intracellularCa , there have been known e.g. trifluoperazine, TMB 8 and W 7, but the latter two compounds are weak in their action and do not display antihypertensive action in vivo.Trifluoperazine has not been practically used as an antihypertensive agent or an ameliorant of cerebral circulation, due to its side effects e.g. on the central nervous system. The compounds of this invention having a remarkable intracellular Ca antagonism are capable of inhibiting contraction caused in any of the cases 1 , 2 and 3 mentioned above, displaying pharmacological activities in a broader area than that where a Ca channel blocker is effective. Besides vasodilating action, they also show bronchodilating action, and are expected to be of use as an antiasthmatic drug. The compounds I of this invention also have protective action on the damages of ischemic heart, brain and kidney.The compounds I show low toxicity and less side effects including orthostatic hypotension often observed by administration of prazosin, one of the typical a adrenoceptor blockers, and thus are very useful for treatment and protection of hypertension and ischemic cardiovascular diseases such as cerebral infarction, transient ischemic attack,myocardial infarction, acute renal failure and nephritis. In the use of the compound I or its salt as the above mentioned pharmaceuticals, it can be administered orally or otherwise in such dosage forms as powders, granules, tablets, capsules, injections, etc. which may be prepared by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient or diluent. Although the dosage should vary with such factors as the route of administration, and the condition, body weight and age of the patient, etc., 0.05 10 mg kg body weight day, preferably 0.1 5 mg kg body weight day, for instance, is orally administered divided into 1 to several times a day, to an adult patient with hypertension. The starting compound II of this invention can be prepared, for example, by the following processes,Process AEMI7.1 Process BEMI8.1 Process C when A is shown by B CH2 EMI8.2 In the above formulae, Y stands for halogen, R6 and R7 each stands for hydrogen or lower alkyl, B stands for a bond arm or alkylene, and other symbols are of the same meaning as defined above. The lower alkyl groups shown by R6 and R7 in the above formulae V , VI and VIII are exemplified by those having 1 4 carbon atoms like those representable by R1 R5. The halogen shown by the formulae V and VI is exemplified by chlorine, bromine or iodine.When B in the formula VIII stands for a bond arm, the 2 position of 1,4 benzothiazine is necessarily combined directly to COOR87 and when B stands for alkylene, the carbon number of the alkylene is always less than that of A by one, and B CH2is necessarily equal to A . The following are brief explanations of the respective processes.Process A According to this process, a compound II can be prepared in one step by allowing a compound IV to react with a compound V . This reaction is usually conducted in a suitable solvent at temperatures ranging from about 0 C to about 100 C. The solvent is exemplified by alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol or 2 propanol ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or dimethoxyethane acetonitrile and N, N dimethylformamide.Process B A compound IV is allowed to react with a compound VI to give a compound VII , which is then subjected to halogenation or sulfonylation to produce a compound 11 The reaction between IV and VI can be conducted eaact ly in the same manner as that between IV and V mentioned ed above. The halogenating agent to be used for the halogenation of a compound VII is exemplified by thion chloride, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus tribrid, etc., and the sulfonylating agent is exemplified by methanesulfonyl chloride, benzenesulfonyl chloride, toluenesulfonyl chloride, etc.The halogenation of VII is usually conducted at about 1SOC to about 1000C, in an appropriate solvent exemplified by dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, toluene, etc. The reaction between VII and the sulfonylating agent can be conducted under conditions similar to those used in the halogenation, and, if necessary, it may be conducted more advantageously in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, pyridine, etc. Process C In this process, a compound VIII is first subjected to reduction to give a compound of VII , which is allowed, in a manner similar to that in Process B, to react with a halogenating agent or a sulfonylating agent to produce a compound II . The reduction of the compound VIII can be conducted by the use of e.g. sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, etc. or lithium aluminum hydroxide in a solvent such as ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, etc. at a temperature ranging from about OOC to about 1000C.The starting compound VIII can be synthesized, for example, by the reaction scheme shown below EMI10.1 In the above scheme, all the symbols are of the same meaning as defined above. The reaction between IV and IX is conducted in the same manner as that between IV and V mentioned above to give VIII . Alternatively, VIII can be obtained by allowing X to react with sodium cyanide to give XI , which is then subjected to hydrolysis, and, if necessary, further to esterification. The reaction between X and sodium cyanide can be conducted in a suitable solvent e.g. methanol, ethanol, N,N dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, etc. at about 00C 1000C.The hydrolysis of XI can be conducted by using a mineral acid e.g. hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, etc. or an alkali e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, etc. in a suitable solvent e.g. methanol, ethanol, 2 methoxyethanol, etc. at about 60 C to about 120 C. The resultant carboxylic acid can be converted to a desired ester by a per se known esterification process. Alternatively, XI is processed with hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide in an appropriate alcohol in the presence of a small volume of water to give VIII in one step.
