## Description
The present invention relates to certain compounds with virus binding properties for the diagnosis, prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections, as well as to the use of certain compounds with virus binding properties for the preparation of a composition for the diagnosis, prophylasis or treatment of viral infections. Despite the extensive damage to animals, including human beings, and plants caused by viruses, no general rational therapy has yet been devised against viral infections comparable to, e.g., antibiotic treatment in the case of bacterial infections. Although, in certain cases, a prophylactic approach in the form of a vaccine causing immunization and, in most instances, producing resistance to reinfection for life has successfully been employed, it has not always been possible to develop a vaccine of a sufficiently broad applicability to be effective against a wide variety of strains of the same viral species this, for instance, has been a problem with the influenza vaccines which have hitherto been devised, so that immunization has occurred against the specific strain on which the vaccine has been based, but not against other, closely related strains with slightly different antigenic properties. In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the importance, for a variety of biological interactions, of so called receptors. Receptors, which are often glycolipids or glycoproteins, that is, consist of a carbohydrate portion linked to a lipid or a protein, form integral parts of the plasma membrane of animal and plant cells, being located on the surface of the cell membrane of a wide variety of cells. Their function as specific receptors for a wide range of biological entities is extremely diverse. Due to their carbohydrate portion being exposed on the surface of the cell membrane, they may have antigenic properties or function as cell surface markers they may confer structural rigidity to the outer monolayer of the membrane lipid bilayer they may form part of a system for cell cell interaction and recognition or they may play a part in the interaction of the cell with bioactive factors such as bacterial toxins, glycoprotein hormones or microorganisms, anchoring these to the cell surface. For instance, it is known that there is a connection between such receptors and bacterial infections in that receptor analogues may be used to inhibit the bacterial adhesion necessary to effect an infection. For a viral infection to become established, the viral genome has to penetrate into the host cell. For some membrane enveloped having a membrane around the nucleocapside viruses, this process is known to involve a two step mechanism, namely the sequential attachment to and penetration into the host cell see reference 1 the list of references is given below in the section entitled Bibliography . It is known that the attachment is due to a receptor located on the surface of target cells for viral infection see reference 3 . It has commonly been assumed that the penetration step is a logical consequence of the attachment, producing spontaneous fusion at the surface membrane or penetration after receptor mediated endocytosis. In some cases, a second interaction has been considered, but this is of a less specific kind than the attachment, mainly a hydrophobic interaction with the membrane interior see reference 2 . In the course of the research leading to the present invention, however, it has surprisingly been found that, on the contrary, where certain viruses are concerned, the second binding is specific, being ascribable to a specific substance with definable chemical characteristics. This binding substance is therefore comparable to the known first step receptors see reference 3 which mediate attachment of the virus to the host cell, and is analogously termed the second step receptor. It seems likely that both the first step and the second step receptors are required on a cell for infection to occur. The principal difference between the two receptors is that the first step receptor is present on the specific cell type which is prone to infection with a particular species of virus, while the second step receptor is present on all cells which are the ports of entry of viral infections in general i.e. this receptor is not specific to a particular viral species . Thus, a virus selects its host cell or tissue by means of the first step receptor, but uses a generally available receptor for penetration. It is further assumed that the second step receptor is required for viral survival. Without membrane penetration into the cytoplasm, the attached viral particle would ultimately be degraded in the lysosomes through the efficient cleaning machinery of the cell. The second step receptor binding property is therefore assumed to be a highly conserved genetically stable so that it does not change, conversely to the antigenic properties of the virus property of the virus, regardless of the nature of the first step receptor. A supporting argument in favour of the presence of the second step receptor is the fact that a hydrophobic part of the virus, for instance a hydrophobic peptide sequence such as the peptide sequence constituting the binding site on the virus, cannot spontaneously penetrate into the host cell membrane because of the natural resistance of the membrane. The natural surface membrane is constructed to avoid non regulated uptake of hydrophobic and other substances. This would otherwise seriously interfere negatively with the membrane functions. Many regulatory substances in the organism such as hormones are hydrophobic, and their uptake is mediated by specific receptors and not by mere solubility in the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Therefore, analogously, a virus particle in need of hydrophobic penetration must utilize a bilayer close receptor which means that an attachment to the first step receptor is not sufficient in itself. The seemingly paradoxical phenomenon that a virus receptor common to many cells allows an infection of certain cells only may be explained by the complex nature of the host cell surface which has a layer of glycoconjugates extending 10 The purpose of the present invention is to utilize this basic research concerning first step and second step binding to employ the natural second step receptors as such to compete with the second step receptors present on potential host or target cells for the binding sites on the virus, and by blocking these sites prevent viral penetration into the cells so that viral infection may be prevented or controlled, as well as develop compounds which, because they mimic the binding characteristics of the natural receptor, fulfil the same function of binding to and blocking the binding sites on the virus. It is preferred for the present purpose to employ the second step receptors or similar compounds rather than the first step receptors, as the former are less specific and therefore have a broader more general applicability. Accordingly, the invention concerns the use of a carbohydrate compound which is selected from sphingosine 2 D hydroxy fatty acids of the general formula I phytosphingosine 2 D hydroxy fatty acids of the general formula II dihydrosphingosine 2 D hydroxy fatty acids of the general formula III in which formulae I, II and III R is a monosaccharide moiety which is optionally substituted in position 4 with a mono , di , tri or tetrasaccharide moiety or a derivative thereof, R₁ and R₂ each independently represent a methyl group or a CHO, NO₂, NH₂, OH, SH, CONHNH₂, CON₃ or COOH group, and R₃ represents a hydrocarbon moiety comprising a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon with a chain length of at least 5 carbon atoms D galactopyranosyl D galactopyranosyl and carbohydrate compounds of the general formulae IV or VII wherein R is as defined above, R₄ and R₅ each independently represents a methyl group or a CHO, NO₂, NH₂, OH, SH, CONHNH₂, CON₃ or COOH group, and R₆ represents a hydrocarbon moiety comprising a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon with a chain length of at least 5 carbon atoms which compound is capable of binding to a site on the virus recognizing the binding epitope of a second step virus binding receptor, for the preparation of a composition for the diagnosis, prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections. Furthermore, the invention concerns a carbohydrate compound of the general formulae IV or VII wherein R represents a monosaccharide moiety which is optionally substituted in position 4, R₄ and R₅ each independently represents a methyl group, or a CHO, NO₂, NH₂, OH, SH, CONHNH₂, CON₃ or COOH group, and R₆ represents a hydrocarbon moiety comprising a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon with a chain length of at least 5 carbon atoms, for use for the diagnosis, prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections. Such a compound will, with respect to its conformation and properties, correspond to or be analogous to the binding epitope of a second step virus binding receptor on an animal or plant cell in that it is capable of binding to a site on the virus recognizing the binding epitope of the second step binding receptor in that the compound comprises In the present context, the term binding epitope is intended to mean the smallest possible part of the receptor to interact with the virus. In nature, this binding epitope is carried on the second step receptor of cells which are targets of viral infections, which receptors are generally glycolipids. US 3,622,666 47 and EP 146 810 48 disclose compounds which are included in some of the general formulae given above, namely phrenosin and cerebrosides, respectively. However, these compounds are stated to be useful for other indications than viral infections. Thus, phrenosin mentioned in US 3,622,666 is indicated for use as an antibacterial agent, not an antiviral agent. Consequently, it is surprising that a compound with a known antibacterial effect is also useful for the diagnosis prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections since it is known that other antibacterial agents, e.g. antibiotics of the penicillin type or sulfonamides, have no antiviral effect whatsoever. The cerebrosides disclosed in EP 146 810 are stated to have a wound healing or a cell or tissue regenerating activity. There is no mention or indication in EP 146 810 that these compounds may also be useful for the diagnosis prophylaxis or treatment of viral infections. The existence of the second step receptor comprising such a binding epitope has been demonstrated by the present inventors by means of an assay in which potential receptors in glycolipid form extracted from target cells for infection are separated on a surface chromatogram which by a suitable treatment is made to resemble the biological cell membrane. This means that the potential receptor substances are likely to be exposed in the assay in a similar way to the presentation on the living cell. The results from this assay therefore compare well with binding results from intact cells or tissues. The assay has revealed the presence of first step and second step receptors, and has furthermore revealed those receptor candidates which actually do effect binding. The findings from this assay contradict previously published results which are based on assays in which extracted substances in solubilized micellar form are used to inhibit virus attachment to host cells to provide information on activity. These assays often produce unspecific binding and therefore do not adequately reflect the actual binding mechanisms present on the cell surface. For instance, reference 6 describes the inhibition of hemolysis leakage of red blood cells induced by Sendai virus by means of several long chain fatty acids, that is, an apparent effect on virus penetration. Free fatty acids, however, are not components of the surface membrane. It seems that, in this case, the hydrophobic paraffin chains interact unspecifically with the hydrophobic peptide sequence of the F glycoprotein defined below . Two papers see reference 7 report the inhibition of rhabdovirus by phosphatidylserine and other phospholipids. Finally, two papers by Huang see reference 8 show inhibition of hemolysis caused by Sendai virus and Fowl plague virus using phospholipids and some natural and synthetic glycolipids. Thus, it was possible to inhibit Sendai virus induced hemolysis using fatty acids, or phospholipids, or glycolipids, presented in micellar form. As noted, no binding of Sendai virus by free fatty acids, phospholipids or the natural or synthetic glycolipids used by Huang was found when using the assay developed by the present inventors as described above. The three groups of substances are active at comparable levels, but the polar head groups of the two latter are structurally too different to explain a specific interaction of the virus with this part. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the common part of these substances, the lipid chains, interacts hydrophobically in an unspecific way with the hydrophobic parts of the virus, most likely the N terminal peptide of the F glycoprotein. This means that the substances used by previous researchers cannot be genuine receptors on the host cells. In case of the phospholipids, this conclusion is supported by the number of receptor sites, 10⁶, found on target cells, which is several orders of magnitude too low to correspond to phospholipid, a very common cell surface component. In brief, the data presented in the literature published to date may be explained by an unspecific hydrophobic interaction of the tested substances with a limited number of viruses. Although this interaction may theoretically occur with a part of the same peptide inferred below to bind specifically to the second step receptor with a structurally defined binding epitope, there is no evidence presented in these references for genuine receptor specificity. Furthermore, the hydrophobic interaction recognized is common in many systems. One example is fatty acids of different structures associated with albumin, the major protein in blood plasma of mammals. Therefore, the referred findings cannot be employed for the purposes of the present invention due to the generality of simple hydrophobic interactions. By means of the assay developed by the present inventors, it has therefore become possible, for the first time, to define specific substances which are useful as second step receptors. Thus, as mentioned above, in the assay there is an absence of binding to other membrane components which have been claimed by other researchers cf. the references indicated above to bind the viruses analyzed. For instance, there is no binding to free fatty acids lipids or free carbohydrates, both of which are components of the natural second step receptor, nor to phospholipids like phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylserine, using relevant levels of receptor material. Furthermore, the virus specific binding activity of gangliosides, e.g. as disclosed in C.A. Vol. 98 1983 , abstract No. 32380p 49 C.A. Vol. 98 1983 , abstract No. 104858a 50 EP 136 438 51 , has been shown to be a first step receptor binding by means of the assay described above developed by the present inventors cf. Example 1 below gangliosides have also been shown to act as specific receptors for isolation of Tetanus toxin EP 36 372 52 however, no virus binding activity is mentioned or indicated . Therefore, the specificity of the assay employed by the present inventors has made it possible to define the structure of the second step receptor by avoiding the misleading results obtained by other assay techniques, principally the unspecific interaction between the components employed in the traditional assays. As indicated above, the structure or conformation of the compound to be employed as the receptor substance or receptor substitute has been found to be critical for its efficiency in this respect. It has been found that the compound should have a bent or curved conformation with a polar hydrophobic head group bending towards the plane of the monolayer formed by the hydrophobic part such as the hydrocarbon moiety. Thus, the natural binding epitope carried by 1 O of the approximate steric atomic relations described according to crystallographic conventions with a crystal unit cell of a 11.2 Å, b 9.3 Å, c 46.5 Å, Å 10 From what is outlined above, it appears that the natural receptor has a spoon like or shovel like conformation apparent from the conformation formula shown above with a hexose A bending towards the plane of the monolayer formed by the paraffin chains C . This means that the A second factor which is important for receptor epitope designation is the nature of the protein on the virus which most probably binds this receptor. For instance Sendai virus belonging to the paramyxo virus group and used extensively for experimentation has two proteins on its surface see reference 2 and 3 . The HN hemagglutininneuraminidase protein carries the binding site for the first step receptor containing neuraminic acid. The second protein, the F fusion protein, has been shown to be essential for the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell plasma membrane penetration , which fusion is necessary for delivery of the viral nucleocapside to the cytoplasm see reference 2 and 3 . The involvement of the highly conserved N terminal hydrophobic peptide sequence of the F protein in this process has recently been substantiated by inhibition with a series of synthetic peptides similar to the natural sequence see reference 35 . Analogous N terminal peptides exist on the surface of other viruses see reference 2, White et al. . The material presented in reference 35 shows that the site of action of these synthetic peptides is on the target cell and that the effect is saturable, indicating receptor sites of about 10⁶ per cell. The second step receptor as defined herein should be identical with these sites since there are only two proteins on the Sendai virus surface and two binding properties. The most potent inhibitory synthetic peptide is the N carbobenzoxy peptide Z D Phe L Phe Gly Z denotes carbobenzoxy . The N terminal sequence of the virus surface protein is L Phe L Phe Gly. The unnatural carbobenzoxy group increases the effect about 10³ times compared to the peptide without this group. The unnatural D isomer is 500 times more potent than the corresponding L isomer. These two sets of information, the crystal conformation of the receptor glycolipid and the structure of the inhibitory peptides most likely interacting with this receptor, have been used for molecular modelling of probable associations of peptide and receptor. Based on the logical assumption that the N terminal part of the peptide should be closest to the bilayer, the optimal fit of the synthetic peptide mentioned above and the receptor conformation may be defined as follows. It should be noted that the nomenclature used to denote the position of atoms or functional groups in the molecule is according to reference 38. The curves from quantitative binding assays see below indicate a low affinity binding of the natural receptor to individual sites on the virus, needing multivalency for efficient binding. This explains why the synthetic soluble univalent peptide with the natural sequence is of low potency for inhibition. The role of the unnatural N carbobenzoxy group is to improve the binding by additional hydrophobic interaction with the receptor compared to the natural structure. This group and the better steric fit with the unnatural D Phe than L Phe are not needed in case of a multivalent binding through the natural peptide of the intact virus particle, providing a sufficiently strong total interaction. This may indicate that the hydrophobic receptor part interacting with the carbobenzoxy group is not functional for the virus. However, it is anticipated that an established interaction between virus and a host cell membrane may include a further hydrophobic area than defined by the epitope as outlined above, after a primary interaction and breaking of the membrane resistance has been effected. Viruses known to carry hydrophobic N terminal peptides show a slight variation in the sequence although hydrophobicity is required. Also, there are different effects of inhibition for separate viruses using various synthetic N carbobenzoxy peptides, with a relative reversal of potency in some cases see reference 35 . Extended molecular modelling shows that this wobbling in peptide structure is tolerated and produces a good interaction with the receptor. It should be realized that the binding to the receptor, according to this concept, is mediated by a linear peptide and not by a pocket formed by several peptide loops, often producing both a higher specificity and less tolerance to amino acid substitutions. On the other hand, a linear peptide is probably more efficient in gaining access to this partially buried epitope. As indicated above, the monosaccharide forming the polar hydrophobic part of the epitope may be a pentose, hexose or heptose such as naturally occurring monosaccharides, e.g. xylose, arabinose, glucose, galactose, fucose, ribose, tallose and mannose, or derivatives thereof such as deoxy sugars, acetylated or alkylated sugars, branched sugars, amino sugars and uronic acids. In order to possess the desired characteristics with respect to conformation in particular, the monosaccharide should preferably be in ring such as furanose or pyranose form. Suitable examples of such a monosaccharide are xylopyranose, arabinopyranose, glucopyranose, galactopyranose, mannopyranose, etc. As further indicated above, this monosaccharide may be substituted at position 4 carbon atom 4 of the heterocyclic ring . Preferred mono , di , tri or tetrasaccharides are Gal, Glc, Xyl, Ara, Fuc, Rib, Man, Man D Galactopyranosyl When the receptor or receptor analogue is to be used as such, i.e. is efficient enough to effect binding in itself, R₁ and R₂ are preferably methyl, but when the natural epitope or the synthetic epitope analogue are to be presented in a multivalent form see below , it is preferred that R₁ and or R₂ represents one of the above mentioned reactive groups.R₃ represents a hydrocarbon moiety which may comprise a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon with a chain length of at least 5 carbon atoms. However, the hydrocarbon chains are most usually linear and saturated or monounsaturated. R may be a monosaccharide as specified above, optionally substituted in position 4 by one or more other saccharides as mentioned above thus, the total saccharide comprising the polar hydrophobic part may for instance be It has been experimentally established that glycolipids with up to five saccharides are able to bind the viruses a larger oligosaccharide is likely to constitute a steric hindrance in the access of the virus to the epitope. The best natural binders, as established by quantitative binding studies see below , have been found to be Glc Particularly interesting compounds of the general formula IV are which have been found to show an avidity of binding which is on the same order of magnitude as that of the natural receptor substances cf. Example 5 . As these receptor analogues have been found to be comparable to the natural substances with respect to properties and conformation dimensions , they are fully valid as substitutes for the natural receptor. The advantage of using these or similar synthetic receptor analogues lies in the method of their preparation which may be effected by simpler means than if the natural receptor were to be produced either synthetically or by the more cumbersome method of harvesting them from cell surface membranes. The synthetic receptor analogues of the general formula IV may be prepared by a process comprising reacting a glycoside of the general formula V wherein X represents a leaving group and R is as defined above, with a thiol of the general formula VI wherein R₃ and R₁ are as defined above and reacting the product with an oxidising agent. The reaction may be carried out in water or a suitable organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, ether and dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction may suitably be carried out at room temperature. The reaction time may be from 24 to 48 hours. The reaction is generally carried out with slightly more than 2 equivalents of the thiol of the general formula VI to one equivalent of the glycoside of the general formula V. The reaction may be carried out under slightly alkaline conditions, and the saccharide may be suitably protected. The oxidation of the resulting thio compounds to the corresponding sulphones of the general formula IV may take place using four equivalents or more of the oxidizing agent. Examples of useful oxidizing agents are peracids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, peroxides such as tert.butyl hydroperoxide, aminooxides, gaseous oxygen or inorganic oxidizing agents such as potassium permanganate and chromium trioxide. The reaction is usually carried out at room temperature. The compounds of the formula VII may be prepared from the corresponding sulfides by oxidation as described above. In order to be useful as a diagnostic, prophylactic or therapeutic agent in connection with viral infections, it is important that the compound used for these purposes is provided in such a form or in such a way that a sufficient affinity for the virus is obtained. Thus, the compound, if sufficiently active, may be provided as such in water soluble form, i.e. in univalent form that is, appearing as discrete units of the compound each carrying substantially only one binding epitope . This form is expected to be particularly relevant where synthetic receptors are concerned as these may have a far greater affinity for the viruses than the natural receptors which have been found to show a low affinity binding. Where the natural and, supposedly, several of the synthetic receptors are concerned, the compound may therefore usually preferably be provided in such a form that it presents multiple binding sites for the virus in the following termed multivalent binding in order to produce an efficient binding. In nature, multivalent binding is effected by a large number of protein molecules on the virus surface and a corresponding number of glycolipid receptors on the host cell. When used for the present purpose, the compound should therefore be provided in a form that mimics this multivalent binding. This may be achieved by the use of the natural glycolipid receptors or synthetic receptor analogues of a similar size which may be presented as micelles or on hydrophobic surfaces to resemble the target cell surface . However, the less stable micelles may give rise to unspecific binding to any surface, and therefore the presentation of the receptor or receptor analogue on a solid phase is preferred. Alternatively, the compound may be multivalently coupled to a macromolecular carrier which may be either of two types one in which the carrier has a hydrophobic surface to which a hydrophobic part of the compound is associated by hydrophobic non covalent interaction, the hydrophobic surface for instance being a polymer such as a plastic or any other polymer to which hydrophobic groups have been linked, such as polystyrene, polyethylene and polyvinyl, or it may be a macromolecular carrier to which the compound is covalently bound. In this latter instance, a suitable carrier may be a natural or synthetic polymer. Thus, the carrier may be an oligo or polysaccharide, e.g., cellulose, starch, glycogen, chitosane or aminated sepharose, to which the receptor or receptor analogue may be bonded through a reactive group on the hydrophobic part, such as a hydroxy or amino group present on the receptor active substance, an oligo or polypeptide such as a globulin, albumin and fibrin, the bond being provided through, for instance, a hydroxy or amino group on the hydrophobic part of the receptor or receptor analogue, a combination thereof or a similar suitably substituted conjugate. The carrier may also be an inorganic carrier such as a silicon oxide material, e.g. silica gel, zeolite, diatomaceous earth, or the surface of various glass types such as aminated glass to which the receptor or receptor analogue may be bonded through a hydroxy, carboxy or amino group on the hydrocarbon moiety of the receptor active substance. When the compound is to be used for prophylaxis or therapy, it is vital that the carrier is a physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as a non toxic and or non allergenic carrier. Carriers of this type which are at present contemplated to be useful for this purpose are, for instance, poly L lysine and poly D,L alanine. The present invention is based on the finding that viruses in general appear to need the second step receptor for the essential penetration into the host cell cytoplasm so that the natural binding epitope or a synthetic epitope analogue in uni or multivalent form may be employed to prevent viral infection by blocking the available binding sites on the virus so as to inhibit invasion of the virus into epithelial cells at the port of entry of viral infections. Examples of such ports of entry are the mucous membranes of the eye, nose, oral cavity, throat, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and reproductive organs. The general applicability of the present invention is based on the fact that compounds corresponding to or analogous to the second step binding receptor found on target cells have been shown to bind a wide variety of viruses belonging to the families Adenoviridae, Herpetoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Reoviridae. Other virus families of interest in this connection are the Picornaviridae and Retroviridae. Thus, the viruses of interest include both DNA and RNA viruses and particles with and without a bilayer membrane envelope, which viruses are the cause of a wide range of diseases affecting many different organ systems, examples of which are various influenzas and common colds, diarrhoeas, herpes I and II, mumps, measles, rabies, AIDS and leukaemia. Prophylaxis in the animal, including human, system may be obtained by direct application on the mucous membrane of interest of the virus inhibiting compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable form such as a suspension, aerosol, ointment, suppository, spray, lotion or solution containing the receptor or receptor analogue in univalent or multivalent form as described above. There, the active substance binds the virus and blocks the binding site for the second step receptor. Prophylaxis may also be effected by exposing the virus particles secreted from infected patients or animals to a compound of the invention applied on the surface of apparatus, objects or surfaces which may be or have been brought in contact with such secretions, i.e. the compounds may be used as disinfectants. Exposure of the virus to a multivalent receptor may not only prevent the viruses from penetrating into the target cell, but may also agglutinate the virus particles through multivalent attachments. This means that most virus particles will also be prevented from attachment to the first step receptor. Prophylaxis in the plant system may for instance be effected by spraying seeds, seedlings or adult plants with an effective dosage of a receptor or receptor analogue formulated in a manner to facilitate application such as a solution, suspension or emulsion of a receptor or receptor analogue in multivalent or univalent form as described above. The compounds used according to the invention may also be used therapeutically in cases where infection has already taken place, i.e. when the virus has already passed the mucous membrane at the port of entry and settled within the organism. Therapeutic administration of the receptor is at present contemplated to be achievable by injection or through intestinal absorption or direct absorption from other mucous membranes of a soluble low molecular weight univalent receptor analogue with increased virus binding potency as outlined above. Thus, the injected or absorbed substance is expected to bind virus particles that are budding being expelled after multiplication in infected cells and prevent them from entering new cells spread of infection . A similar prevention of spread is also useful in, for instance, the small intestine after virus infection by oral presentation on a multivalent carrier, e.g. as tablets or capsules in acid resistant form. As an example of application after absorption may be mentioned rabies infection where, after a bite wound , the virus travels through the nerve pathways to finally reach the central nervous system after a period of several months or even years to produce the lethal effect. A compound as described above made to penetrate the blood brain barrier or injected directly into the cerebro spinal fluid is expected to prevent the brain damage caused by viral multiplication within nerve cells. The dosages in which the receptors or receptor analogues are administered may vary widely depending on the intended use, whether for prophylaxis, including disinfection, or therapy, the type of infection to be combated and the age and condition of the patient, but is expected to be at a milligram level. For rotavirus infection diarrhoea , a daily dose of 1 For diagnostic purposes, virus particles present in secretions from infected patients or other samples to be tested may be exposed to the receptor substance which may be presented on the surface of an appropriate carrier material in the form of, for instance, dip sticks, immunological test cards or polymeric beads. After binding, the surface is carefully washed, and the presence of the virus may be shown in several ways already established within clinical virology. For instance, the virus may first be adsorbed in microtiter wells followed by detection by ELISA methods see reference 1, Materials and Methods and Example 6 . Also, the other assays developed by the present inventors may be adapted for a simplified diagnostic use. It is also contemplated that the compounds described above may be used for various biotechnological purposes such as the preparation and isolation of virus particles or virus surface components through the use of established affinity chromatographic methods. For this purpose, the receptor substance may be coupled to a solid support such as multivalently coupled to a macromolecular carrier as described above for binding the ligand in chromatographic columns, for electrophoresis, filtration, sedimentation or centrifugation. The properties of the receptor binding constant, etc. may be optimized for elution, by the design of the synthesis of the compound so as to avoid irreversible binding of the virus to the receptor. In this way, it may be possible to isolate or purify virus particles or virus substances and or detect viruses in various samples by their binding to receptor or receptor analogues coupled to these solid supports. Another suggested use of the receptors or receptor analogues may be to isolate the substance on the virus membrane which is responsible for virus binding. It is contemplated that this substance may be used for vaccination purposes, i.e. to immunize the human being or animal in question not only against the viral disease imparted by the viral species from which the substance has been derived, but also against other viral diseases imparted by viruses having the same substance on their surface. Thus, it is at present assumed that a broad spectered vaccine against a variety of viral diseases may be produced in this manner. Compared to the usual methods of vaccination using attenuated virus preparations, such a vaccine would have the decided advantage that non infectous virus components may stimulate the production of antibodies which are able to neutralize the virus in question by blocking the essential molecule for virus entry into the host cell for infection. Finally, it is contemplated that it may be possible to select binding proteins or glycoproteins from the viruses in the manner described above which may be used for targeting drugs to specific cells within an organism. For instance, a liposome lipid vesicle may be equipped with, e.g., a monoclonal antibody with specificity for a certain target cell for instance a tumor cell or a cell carrying intracellular parasites . To avoid being eventually inactivated through endocytotic uptake to the lysosomes, the liposome may also be tagged with the viral component recognizing the second step receptor. In this way, the established virus mechanism for penetration may be employed as part of a vehicle for carrying a toxic drug. The liposome may be exchanged with a direct chemical coupling of antibody first step and viral component second step with the active subunit of a bacterial toxin exerting its actions only inside the cell see reference 12 . The compounds described above may also function as an antiviral agent. It is to be understood that the compound should be used in isolated form, that is, should not be carried by the cells which, in nature, carry the compound. In the use according to the present invention, a compound with the characteristics and properties described above is formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or excipient. The composition prepared may be formulated for administration by any suitable route such as by oral ingestion, injection or topical application. Thus, the composition may be in the form of, for instance, a suspension, solution, aerosol, ointment, lotion, cream, spray, suppository, implant, tablet, capsule or lozenge containing the receptor or receptor analogue in univalent or multivalent form as explained above. It is contemplated that for prophylactic use, the composition may be in a form suitable for topical application on the mucous membrane of, e.g., the eye, nose, oral cavity and throat, such as an aerosol, spray, lozenge, lotion or cream, and for the purposes of disinfection, the receptor or receptor analogue in question may be provided as, e.g., paper tissues or a liquid which is suited for rinsing apparatus, objects or surfaces which may be or has been brought into contact with secretions from infected patients. For therapeutic applications, it is contemplated that compositions adapted for injection, such as solutions or suspensions of the receptor or receptor analogue in a suitable vehicle such as water or isotonic saline, as well as adapted for oral ingestion and absorption through the intestinal mucosa such as tablets or capsules will be convenient. In order to protect the receptor or receptor analogue from possible impairment or degradation in gastric juices, the tablets or capsules may be provided with an acid resistant coating. Compositions adapted for absorption of the receptor substance through mucous membranes may also be in the form of suppositories such as vaginal or rectal suppositories. The pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or excipients and optionally other pharmaceutically acceptable materials present in the composition such as diluents, binders, colorants, flavouring agents, preservatives and disintegrants are all selected in accordance with conventional pharmaceutical practice in a manner understood by persons skilled in the art of formulating pharmaceuticals. The invention is further described with reference to the drawing in which Fig. 1 shows an assay of Sendai virus S variant binding to the first step receptor, analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. The two lanes to the left have been detected chemically and are total gangliosides neuraminic acid containing glycolipids of human erythrocytes lane 1 and human brain lane 2 . The same two lanes are shown to the right after binding of Sendai virus and autoradiography. As shown, there is no virus binding to the major brain bands of lane 2. In contrast, there is an apparently strong binding to several erythrocyte bands of lane 1, especially slow moving ones. Fig. 2 shows an assay of Sendai virus S variant binding to the second step receptor, analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. This illustrates the possible analysis of a large number of receptor candidates as mixtures of glycolipids of various origins screening for receptors possible with this assay. To the left is the chromatogram after chemical detection with anisaldehyde and to the right the autoradiogram after an overlay of virus over the same lanes. The following are the total non acid glycolipids shown human erythrocytes lane 1 , human meconium lane 2 , intestine from Fig. 3 shows an assay of Sendai virus S variant binding to the second step receptor substances, analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. This illustrates the binding to substances which are synthetic or have been isolated from natural sources and identified chemically. To save space, several pure substances were added to the same lane, starting with the most rapid moving substance as shown in the chromatogram to the left, detected by anisaldehyde.

These have been summarized elsewhere Karlsson, in Chapman, ed., Fig. 6 shows the conformation of the second step receptor as obtained by single crystal X ray crystallography of synthetic substance 1 of Table 3 with dihydrosphingosine and 2D hydroxy stearic acid cf. Pascher et al., Fig. 7 shows a thin layer chromatogram detected with anisaldehyde to illustrate the existence of second step receptor glycolipids in epithelial cells of the human small intestine. Epithelial cells and total non acid glycolipids were prepared and identified as described in Materials and Methods. The double bands which are common to the four lanes have been identified as a mixture of 1 and 2 of Table 3, the two most optimal natural virus binders Example 2 and Fig. 4 . The more slow moving glycolipids are blood group fucolipids and vary among the four individuals analyzed which were of the following blood group phenotypes.

The composition of these samples has been described by Björk et al., in Cartron et al., eds., Fig. 8 shows the structural concept of the outer monolayer of the animal cell surface membrane as described in detail elsewhere Karlsson, in Chapman, ed., The human and animal glycolipid samples used for binding studies, either pure glycolipid species or total or partial glycolipid mixtures, were prepared substantially as described in reference 13 from lyophilized tissue through repeated chloroform methanol extractions, mild alkaline treatment to degrade non sphingolipids and dialysis for 4 days against water to remove water soluble products. Remaining lipid material is first separated on a silica gel column to elute the dominating fatty acid esters before the totally alkali stable sphingolipids. These are then separated on DEAE cellulose or DEAE Sepharose columns in a non acid and acid glycolipid fraction. The acid fraction is then usually separated by gradient elution from DEAE Sepharose . The non acid fraction is acetylated in acetic anhydride and pyridine and repeatedly fractionated on silica gel with stepwise or continuous gradient elution with methanol in chloroform or other solvents. Fractions are deacetylated in mild alkali and further fractionated until pure if necessary. Purity is tested by thin layer chromatography and further checked by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy as described below. To prepare glycolipids completely free from non glycolipid contaminants, 250 ml of methanol are added to about 250 ml of human blood plasma of one transfusion unit, and the mixture is heated to 70 C for 30 minutes with constant stirring in a one liter evaporation bottle. The extract is filtered and the residue transferred back to the extraction bottle. The procedure is repeated twice with 250 ml of chloroform methanol 2 1 by volume and once with 250 ml of methanol. The combined extracts are evaporated to dryness with the addition of small volumes of toluene. Small amounts of wet cells may be extracted in a similar way. On a larger scale, the tissue is first lyophilized in pieces and subjected to extraction in two steps in a Soxhlet apparatus. In the case of human small intestine e.g. 130 g dry weight , the first extraction is with chloroform methanol 2 1 by volume for 24 hours 1000 ml of solvent in a 2000 ml round bottle placed in an asbestos insulated electrical heating device . The second extraction is carried out with 1500 ml of chloroform methanol 1 9 by volume for 24 hours. The combined extracts are evaporated to dryness without filtration. The dried plasma extract residue is treated with 50 ml of 0.2 M KOH in methanol for 3 hours in a bottle containing five glass beads for fine dispersion during occasional shaking. The KOH is neutralized with 1 ml of acetic acid. The mixture is dialyzed against water in a dialysis bag after the addition of 100 ml of chloroform and 40 ml of water to produce a two phase system. After dialysis for 4 days against running tap water, the content of the bag is evaporated at 70 C with repeated additions of toluene. The sample is finally filtrated and eluted with chloroform methanol 2 1 by volume and methanol. In case of the intestinal total extract, 500 ml of KOH in methanol are used. The plasma sample about 1.4 g is loaded on a 10 g column of silica gel packed in chloroform. The silica gel used is principally obtained from Mallinckrodt Chem. Works, St. Louis, USA, sieved to a particle size of more than 45 µm and dried. However, LiChroprep Si 60 E. Merck, Darmstadt, West Germany with comparable specifications has similar properties although some of the silica gel may elute. Three fractions are eluted 100 ml of chloroform elute the main bulk about 1 g of the extract cholesterol and methyl esters of fatty acids 100 ml of chloroform methanol 98 2 by volume may contain free ceramide 100 ml of chloroform methanol 1 3 by volume and 100 ml of methanol elute all glycolipids and alkali stable phospholipids about 60 mg . In case of the dialyzed small intestinal sample about 40 g , 50 g of silica gel and 500 ml of solvent are used in each step. The third fraction from the silica gel chromatography of the plasma sample is loaded on a column of 5 g of DEAE cellulose DE 23, Whatman in acetate form packed in chloroform methanol 2 1 by volume . The loaded sample is allowed to equilibrate on the column for 1 or 2 days. Two fractions are eluted, one with 100 ml of chloroform methanol 2 1 by volume and 100 ml of methanol eluting non acid glycolipids and alkali stable phospholipids, mainly sphingomyelin, and one with 50 ml of 5 w v LiCl in methanol eluting acid glycolipids sulphatides and gangliosides and alkali stable phospholipids. The latter fraction is dialyzed with 30 ml of chloroform and 20 ml of water against running tap water for 4 days. It may be used as a total acid glycolipid fraction or be further processed as described to separate sulphatides and gangliosides Breimer et al., Acetylation of the dry non acid plasma sample is performed in the dark overnight in 2 ml of chloroform, 2 ml of pyridine and 2 ml of acetic anhydride. The chloroform is added to improve solubility and ensure complete reaction. 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of toluene are added, and the sample is evaporated in a stream of nitrogen on a heated water bath and finally subjected to vacuum suction. The acetylated plasma sample is loaded on a 10 g column of silica gel packed in chloroform methanol 98 2 by volume . For this purpose, particles smaller than 45 µm treated with methanol and dried are used. Three fractions are eluted 100 ml of chloroform methanol 95 5 by volume , 100 ml of chloroform methanol 90 10 by volume , and 100 ml of chloroform methanol 1 3 by volume plus 100 ml of methanol. The third fraction contains mainly acetylated sphingomyelin. The first two fractions which contain acetylated glycolipids and some contaminants are evaporated together and deacetylated. For the intestinal fraction, 50 g of silica gel are used. Deacetylation of acetylated glycolipids may be performed in two ways, one with and one without a dialysis step. The deacetylated plasma sample is filtered through a column of 2 g of DEAE cellulose packed in chloroform methanol 2 1 by volume . The loaded sample is allowed to equilibrate for 1 2 days before elution with 50 ml of chloroform methanol 2 1 by volume and 50 ml of methanol. The purpose of this step is to remove alkali stable amino group containing phospholipids which have been transferred into N acetylated derivatives during the acetylation procedure. This makes them acid. A final silica gel chromatography step removes non polar contaminants eluted in the first two fractions. The plasma sample is loaded on a column of 5 g of silica gel particles smaller than 45 µm packed in chloroform methanol 98 2 by volume . After elution of two fractions with each 50 ml of chloroform methanol 98 2 by volume , the pure glycolipids are eluted with 50 ml of chloroform methanol 1 3 by volume and 50 ml of methanol. The final yield of total non acid glycolipids in plasma from one transfusion unit of human blood is 6 8 mg. The preparative steps are controlled by thin layer chromatography silica gel 60 nanoplates E. Merck, Darmstadt, West Germany , preferably using chloroform methanol water 65 25 4 by volume for non derivatized and chloroform methanol 95 5 by volume for acetylated samples. Anisaldehyde is preferred as a detection reagent because it forms characteristic colours glycolipids usually become green or blue green, glycerophospholipids grey or violet, and sphingomyelin and ceramide blue cf. reference 21 . The procedure outlined above results in a total non acid glycolipid mixture one to about 20 sugars completely free from non glycolipid contaminants. This fraction is important for testing the presence of the second step receptor in various cell sources see Figs. 2 and 7 . To isolate the second step receptor in pure form from such glycolipid mixtures, the final silica gel chromatographic step described above may be slightly modified as follows. After elution with chloroform methanol 98 2 by volume , the one sugar second step receptor is easily eluted with chloroform methanol 95 5 90 10 by volume . For large scale preparation from selected sources, the procedure described above may, however, be simplified a great deal as outlined below. Accessible second step receptor sources may be mammalian intestine see Fig. 7 , yeast or fungi, and some invertebrates. For example, it has been shown that the starfish, Structural analysis of isolated fractions is done on non degraded samples by mass spectrometry see reference 14 and NMR spectroscopy see reference 15 and a combined use of permethylated, permethylated LiAIH₄ reduced, and in case of acid glycolipids permethylated LiAIH₄ reduced trimethylsilylated derivatives. In this way, the sequence and anomerity of the oligosaccharide and the composition of the ceramide is obtained. Degradation is also performed to receive the information on the type of sugars and positions of linkage, through combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry as described in reference 16. Several synthetic ceramides were used, including the combinations sphingosine non hydroxy fatty acid, sphingosine hydroxy fatty acid, phytosphingosine non hydroxy fatty acid and phytosphingosine hydroxy fatty acid see reference 17 . Similar natural combinations of long chain base and fatty acid were also prepared using the method referred to above. Sphingomyelin was obtained by the procedure described above. Various phosphoglycerides were prepared without alkaline degradation and separated on DEAE cellulose into acid phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and non acid phospholipids. The non acid phospholipids were then separated on silica gel columns into phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. The substances were tested for purity by thin layer chromatography and identified by analysis of components see reference 18 . Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine were also purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Two glycoglycerolipids of plant origin, galactosyldiglyceride and digalactosyldiglyceride, were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Several synthetic monoglycosylceramides were received from Dr. Irmin Pascher, and their preparation has been described in Pascher, Chemical synthesis of the second step receptor GalßCer or GlcßCer may be performed in various ways as referred to above and reviewed in detail in reference 13. For example, dihydrosphingosine base of formula A in Fig. 5 may be prepared according to Carter et al. or Jenny and Grob see reference 13 . Hydroxy fatty acid may be coupled to this using the p nitrophenylester Pascher, Mono or oligosaccharides coupled to a lipid part or multivalently to bovine serum albumin substances 1 5 and 10 14 of Table 1 were purchased from The Sugar Company, Arlöv, Sweden. Novel receptor analogues of relevance for the present invention substances 6 9 and 15 18 of Table 1 were prepared by and received from Dr. Göran Magnusson, Department of Organic Chemistry 2, University of Lund, Sweden Dahmen et al., Epithelial cells from fresh tissues were prepared in two ways by washing and by scraping. Washing was performed with EDTA containing phosphate buffer in intestinal loops as described in reference 19. A loop was filled with buffer and incubated in a water bath at 37 C with gentle moving stirring for a few minutes, after which the intestinal content was decanted off. This was repeated 5 10 times and each fraction was centrifuged and cells examined by microscopy and marker enzyme alkaline phosphatase, thymidine kinase analyses. Fractions containing pure epithelial cells were pooled and used for the preparation of glycolipids as outlined above. In this way, epithelial cells from the small and large intestine of several human individuals and of rat strains were analyzed. Human small intestine was also gently scraped with a spoon to obtain epithelial cells somewhat contaminated with non epithelial residue. In a similar way, human urinary tract urether epithelial cells were obtained as well as epithelial cells from dog and mouse intestines. The small intestine of several other animals was analyzed, including cat, cod fish, guinea pig, hamster, hen and rabbit see reference 20 . In addition to mass spectrometry etc. for information on ceramide components, the samples were run on a borate impregnated silica gel plate where monoglycosylceramides separate both according to Gal and Glc and the major ceramide combinations of sphingosine, phytosphingosine, non hydroxy and 2 hydroxy fatty acid see reference 21 . In the receptor assays used, bound virus was detected by anti virus antibody. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were prepared according to standard methods Rose et al., eds., Adenovirus 2 and 7 were propagated in A 549 cells and hyperimmune sera were obtained by established immunization of rabbits Wadell, The antibodies were tested for the absence of unspecific binding in the binding assay system using all ingredients except virus. In this way, it was excluded that the antibodies bound directly to specific glycolipid bands, which phenomenon otherwise may produce falsely positive results. The assay for the detection of virus binding to glycolipids and for testing of detailed specificity of binding has been developed by the present inventors and is of decisive importance for the invention cf. Hansson et al., Mixtures of total lipids up to 100 µg in each lane or total glycolipids 20 40 µg in each lane or pure glycolipids 0.01 1 µg were separated on aluminum sheets, about 5 5 cm, coated with silica gel 60 Merck , usually with chloroform methanol water 60 35 8, by volume as the solvent for non acid glycolipids, and with chloroform methanol 2.5 M ammonia 60 40 9, by volume as the solvent for acid glycolipids. For purposes of comparison, a parallel plate is detected chemically by spraying and heating with anisaldehyde solution. For virus binding, the dried chromatogram with separated substances is dipped for 1 minute in 200 ml of diethylether containing 0.5 w v of polyisobutylmethacrylate Plexigum P28, Röhm GmbH, Darmstadt and dried for 2 minutes. The plate is then sprayed with phosphate buffered saline PBS of pH 7.3 containing 2 bovine serum albumin BSA and 0.1 NaN₃ solution A and then immersed in solution A and placed in a Petri dish for 2 hours. After tipping off solution A, the virus suspension is added about 25 µg per ml with about 2 ml for a plate of the dimensions given above to the chromatogram placed horizontally in the humidified atmosphere of a Petri dish. After incubation for 2 hours, the virus suspension is tipped off and the plate is washed six times with PBS, 1 minute each time. In a typical case of antibody, monoclonal antibody 817 directed against Sendai virus produced in ascitic fluid is diluted 1 100 with solution A, using about 2 ml per plate, with incubation for 2 hours. After washing five times with PBS, about 2 ml of rabbit anti mouse Fab is incubated for 2 hours 4 10⁵ cpm ml of ¹²⁵I labelled F ab ₂, the Radiochemical Centre, Amersham . After six washings in PBS, the plate is dried and exposed to XAR 5 X ray film Eastman , usually for 2 3 days, using an intensifying screen. The treatment with plastic produces a hydrophobic surface. Separated glycolipid or other bands are thus induced to be exposed on the hydrophobic solid surface similar to the way lipids are exposed in the biological membrane. This means that the test substance is densely anchored with its paraffin chains in the plastic surface with the polar head groups exposed and accessible to the environment. This mimics the surface monolayer of the living cell. This plastic treatment is highly critical for specificity and reproducibility and explains the advantage of this solid phase method over traditional inhibition assays based on solubilized aggregates or micelles see reference 22 . The detection limit varies with the avidity of the ligand but is in the range of 5 50 ng of receptor, or in about the same picomole range. For a receptor candidate to be considered negative in the tabulated results, there should be no darkening at a one or more microgram level. Good binders give saturating black bands at 100 ng. An obvious advantage of this assay is that mixtures of substances are first separated into substance species, avoiding the risk of shielding of minor components, or false negative binding due to contaminating substances. Also, the coating with albumin blocks unspecific hydrophobic sites, which otherwise may cause false positive results. Finally, the extensive washings remove more loose unspecific associations. By comparison, traditional inhibition assays usually incubate virus with target cells in suspension in the absence or presence of sonicated micelles. In case of the hemolysis assay, simple photometry is done on the mixture after centrifugation cf. Huang, For quantification of virus binding, a technique was adopted from the analogous solid phase binding or antibodies to microtiter wells Brockhaus et al., Attempts to inhibit the binding of virus by means of the two assays described above were done by a preincubation of the virus for one or two hours with up to 2 mg per ml of free saccharide or BSA conjugated saccharide in PBS or BSA PBS. This mixture is then added in toto to the plate or well. Inhibition studies were also performed by means of an ELISA technique enzyme linked immunosorbent assay as follows see reference 1 and Rose et al., eds, Inhibition of virus binding by substance 9 of Table 1 was performed as follows. About 2 µg of virus were preincubated in a siliconized test tube with about 200 µg of substance 9 for 2 hours at 37 C and then transferred in 50 µl portions to the wells and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, followed by four washings with the buffer containing 1 BSA. The subsequent steps were carried out as described above. Substance 9 was diluted 1 4 in 7 separate preincubation steps. Preliminary experiments were also performed on the inhibition of virus binding in the two assays described by preincubating the virus as above with sonicated micelles of amphipathic glycolipids and other substances. This was done for Sendai virus. Plaque inhibition test Lycke et al., eds., Phosphatidylcholine 200 µg , cholesterol 100 µg and Galß1 4GlcßCer with 2 hydroxy fatty acid 230 µg or the first two lipids and phosphatidylserine 200 µg were dissolved in chloroform methanol and the solvent evaporated in a tube. 4 ml of PBS were added and the mixture sonicated in a Vetrasonics model W 370 for 1 2 hour at room temperature. The virus was diluted with PBS to give approximately 4 10³ plaque forming units per ml. 0.5 ml virus and 0.5 ml sonicated micelles or PBS as control were incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. Dilutions and titration of remaining infectious virus on CER cell monolayers are carried out under standard conditions Lennette, ed., Sendai virus was used as the model virus for analysis cf. the overlay assay method described in Materials and Methods because it is relatively well studied with respect to its binding to neuraminic acid containing receptors the first step receptor see reference 26 Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the binding of the virus to the conceptual first step and second step receptors, respectively . Preparations of the virus prepared as described in Materials and Methods were analyzed, and two previously unknown receptor binding variants of the Z strain were shown to carry separate specificities in the case of binding to neuraminic acid containing glycolipids gangliosides . The S variant bound to gangliosides of human erythrocytes only but not to gangliosides of the human brain Fig. 1 . The G variant, on the other hand, bound to gangliosides of both sources not shown . It is known that the gangliosides of the two sources are structurally related but differ in their core sequences. Thus, cleavage of neuraminic acid by the enzyme neuraminidase from the gangliosides completely abolishes binding of the two virus preparations. This shows that the binding to gangliosides is completely dependent on the presence of neuraminic acid but that the binding epitope of the glycolipids also includes the non neuraminic acid parts, which differ between brain and erythrocyte. Therefore, the first step receptor specificity in these two cases differ and should correspond to separate, chemically different sites on the two viruses recognizing the receptors. That several bands in the assay may bind is explained by the presence of the receptor epitope on core substances of various sizes which differ in chromatographic mobility. The fact that the G variant of the virus binds to gangliosides of both origins may be explained by a less strict specificity in the binding compared to the S variant. In contrast to the different binding to gangliosides first step receptors , the two variants bind the second step receptors in an identical way. This is shown for the S variant in Fig. 2. As will be explained in further detail in Example 2, this binding is to glycolipids lacking neuraminic acid and is thus chemically distinct from the first step binding. This shows that a virus may have two chemically distinct and separate receptors. Furthermore, the results obtained from the assay illustrate the specificity of the method as explained in the specification and in Materials and Methods. The selective binding is evident when comparing the patterns obtained by autoradiography virus binding with chemical spraying all substances visualized . Some major bands appearing from spraying and being structurally closely related to receptor substances are completely negative for virus binding cf. Example 2 . A large number of receptor candidates Table 3 was analyzed for binding activity using the overlay assay described in Materials and Methods. Mixtures of extracts from target cells or tissues for viral infections extracted by means of organic solvents as described in Materials and Methods were pre separated on the chromatogram surface allowing the detection of active substances after overlayering with the virus preparation in question. A binding substance was isolated and structurally characterized and used in pure form for more detailed binding studies. Sendai virus was first used in these analyses. As one single overlay assay may contain more than 100 substances of a diverse structure, a very efficient selection of actual receptors was obtained. Using human and animal tissues of various kinds like nerve tissue, blood, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and including both adult and fetal tissues, only the glycolipids marked with a in Table 3 and further defined in Table 4 were shown to be receptors. There was no binding at relevant levels of other surface membrane or other substances like cholesterol or various glycerophospholipids that were coextracted in the procedures employed. On the other hand, several of the viruses analysed cf. Table 2 , including Sendai virus cf. Example 1 , showed a glycolipid binding different from that of Tables 3 and 4 which was chemically distinct and corresponded to the first step receptor. An important finding was that the binding to the natural receptors depends on the composition of the lipophilic part of the glycolipid, the ceramide, as defined in Table 4 and illustrated for some species in Fig. 3. Only species with 2 D hydroxy fatty acid in the ceramide are active. Therefore, all natural glycolipids used for detailed testing concerning the importance of variation in the carbohydrate part Table 3 were chosen for the presence of 2 hydroxy fatty acid. Species referred to in Table 3 as being positive are active when containing 2 hydroxy fatty acid but inactive when containing non hydroxy fatty acid. The virus is able to bind glycolipids with up to five sugars Table 3 . However, quantitative binding studies cf. Materials and Methods reveal that the one sugar substances GalßCer and GlcßCer are the best binders. In Fig. 4, curve A represents these two glycolipids. Curve C represents the two sugar glycolipid 3 of Table 3 and curve D represent the three sugar glycolipid 5. It is important to note that the avidity strength of binding for this second step receptor is on the same order of magnitude as that of the established first step receptor curve B . The binding to larger glycolipids is therefore explained by a recognition of an internal part of the molecules. Such an unconventional binding is not unexpected in view of the inventors results from carbohydrate receptor binding for several bacteria and bacterial toxins see reference 23, 25 and 46 . The fact that some the major part of the glycolipids tested do not bind although they contain the binding epitope, e.g. 4GlcßCer, is rationalized by a steric hindrance in the access of the large virus particle to this one sugar epitope. It is also further evidence for a stereospecificity at the molecular level, allowing the use of the concept of receptor specificity, and strongly arguing against an unspecific interaction. Of interest to wider applications, plants are known to contain receptor glycosphingolipids see reference 41 . Substance 2 of Table 3 with 2 hydroxy fatty acid is a dominating glycolipid in plant leaves. Also, substances 26 and 27 shown to bind Sendai virus are relatively abundant in plants and may serve as receptors for plant viruses. The finding that there is no binding to free ceramide lacking carbohydrate is important for the interpretation of the binding epitope of the receptor substances. Furthermore, in the assay, there is no inhibition of binding of virus to receptors when adding various free oligosaccharides or oligosaccharides, e.g. Galß, Glcß or Galß1 4Glcß, coupled multivalently to albumin cf. Example 6 . From this it may be concluded that there is binding to the glycolipid only neither ceramide alone nor saccharide alone or coupled to a protein is able to interact with the virus. The curves obtained from the quantitative binding studies Fig. 4 indicate that the avidity of the binding is very similar for the first step and second step receptors curve B and A, respectively . As the first step receptor has already been studied for biological relevance see reference 3 , this means that the binding avidity for the second step receptor is at a biologically adequate level. Also, the best second step binder is that with one sugar compare curves A, C and D , and some binders with several sugars do not raise up curve E although the binding is clearly detectable in the overlay assay Table 3 . A second conclusion from quantitative analyses by means of this assay is that the binding is of the low affinity type needing multivalency to be efficient. This is based on a comparison, in the same assay, of virus binding with the binding of several bacteria and bacterial toxins to their respective receptor glycolipids. Several bacteria see reference 23 and 46 and the Shiga toxin see reference 25 and 46 bind similarly to the virus the curves raise at similar levels of receptor dilution . On the other hand, in case of cholera toxin similar size as Shiga toxin , the raise of the curve is shifted to the left at a 10² 10³ greater receptor dilution. These different locations of the curves coincide with the possibility to inhibit ligand binding to the receptor glycolipids using soluble, univalent oligosaccharide receptor analogues. Cholera toxin is easily inhibited but for Shiga toxin, there is no detectable inhibition at the level of 5 mg ml of the receptor disaccharide. However, the Shiga toxin is easily inhibited using the disaccharide coupled multivalently to albumin. The conclusion is a high affinity binding in case of cholera toxin and a low affinity binding in case of the Shiga toxin, the latter needing multivalency to be efficient. A similar situation as for Shiga toxin exists for several bacteria. As the curves for virus binding coincide with those of Shiga toxin and several bacteria but not with that of cholera toxin, the virus binding is of the low affinity type. Therefore, application of the natural binding epitope for virus binding would seem to need a multivalent presentation. This is present in the binding assays and in the biological membrane Example 4 and corresponds to a multiplicity of binding proteins on the virus surface. The approach described above for Sendai virus was extended to a series of other viruses, representing most of the known virus families Table 2 . All viruses shown in Table 2 were shown to bind in a way which was very similar to Sendai virus in the case of the second step receptor, although several of them also showed a separate first step receptor analogous to that of Sendai virus Example 1 . The analyses of these viruses was performed using the virus preparations and antibodies for detection as described in Materials and Methods. To cover as many receptor candidates as possible, the glycolipid mixtures employed for the assay shown in Fig. 2 were used. Additionally, several isolated substances of Table 3 were used in dilutions on the thin layer plate to test the avidity of binding compared to Sendai virus. The results showed that all viruses tested had a binding pattern identical with or very similar to that of Fig. 2, with similar binding avidity. This means that the viruses tested have a specific binding property in common which should correspond to a common binding protein on the virus surface. This property does not depend on the different envelopes of the viruses or the character of the genome Table 2 . Therefore, morphologically and genetically different viruses causing a wide variety of human and animal diseases affecting separate organ systems possess a common binding property, namely a second step receptor which is probably used for penetration. As described in Materials and Methods, individual receptor active substances were isolated in pure form and chemically characterized. This gave information both on the structure of the polar hydrophobic part i.e. the saccharide structure including type of sugars, sequence, position of binding, anomerity and ring size and the non polar part i.e. the ceramide, including fatty acid chain structure as regards their length, branching and degree of unsaturation and the position and configuration of the hydroxyl groups, and the long chain base structure as regards the length of the paraffin chain, unsaturation, and the position and configuration of functional groups . The methods used were high technology mass spectrometry see reference 14 and NMR spectroscopy see reference 15 in addition to conventional degradation methods. To get a wide range of structures for testing, tissues from different animals were used as preparative sources see reference 13a and 33 . Some of the epithelial tissues used have been described concerning glycolipid structures sucti as human intestine see reference 42 and 43 , rat intestine see reference 13a , mouse intestine see reference 20 and 44 , dog intestine see reference 45 , and intestines from cat, cod fish, guinea pig, hamster and rabbit see reference 20 . Several other tissues were also analyzed as described in Example 2. Many of these structures have recently been reviewed see reference 13 . This means that a very large number of glycolipids and other substances not included in Table 3 were analyzed but found negative for binding to Sendai virus. A very important feature is the dependence of binding on the ceramide structure, as summarized in Table 4 for one particular glycolipid, No. 3 of Table 3, isolated from the indicated natural sources and carefully analyzed for its detailed structure. The experiments were performed as described in Materials and Methods using the overlay binding assay. Criteria for positive binding were also defined. The glycolipids tested were defined by the structural methods described in Materials and Methods. The detailed structures of various molecular species of ceramides are shown in Fig. 5. The letters in Table 4 also refer to this Figure. Thus, although the oligosaccharide structure is identical for the four variants, only those having a 2 D hydroxy fatty acid in the ceramide bind the virus. This was repeatedly reproduced for other glycolipids of Table 3 as well. This, at first sight, appears to mean that the 2 hydroxy group is specifically involved in the binding. However, binding studies of various synthetic glycolipids rule this out Example 5 . Instead, the interpretation is that glycosphingolipids with a 2 hydroxy fatty acid differ in conformation from glycosphingolipids having a non hydroxy fatty acid. This has been documented by X ray crystallographic analysis of the former see reference 31 and NMR analysis of the latter see reference 32 . In these cases, synthetic one sugar glycosphingolipids were used. The 2 hydroxy glycosphingolipid has a spoon like or shovel like conformation cf. Fig. 6 with the saccharide ring positioned at an angle of about 110 in relation to the ceramide. In the non hydroxy isomer, this angle is about 180 . Going through all other structural parameters of the substances analyzed, this is the only common denominator of interpretation. Therefore, as discussed above, the importance of the 2 hydroxy group of the glycosphingolipid is to present the first saccharide in the proper bent preferred conformation. This makes the α side of this sugar accessible for binding, which has therefore been interpreted as part of the binding epitope. In the presentation of the sugar more or less at right angles to the membrane like surface of the assay in the case of the non hydroxy glycosphingolipids, this binding epitope is not likely to be accessible for virus binding. As described in Examples 2 and 3, a large number of epithelial tissues of different animals have been used by the present inventors as sources for the preparation of glycolipids. To test more precisely the location of receptor glycolipids to the epithelial cells which are the direct targets of viral infections, such cells were isolated as described in Materials and Methods. The technique was worked out for rat intestinal cells see reference 19 including both small and large intestine, and was applied also on human small and large intestine. Also, a mucosa scraping was performed on human intestine see reference 42 and human urether. A common denominator of all epithelial samples analyzed cf. Materials and Methods , regardless of tissue or animal source, is the existence of GlcßCer substance 2 of Table 3 with 2 hydroxy fatty acid and in many cases also GalßCer with 2 hydroxy fatty acid. Therefore, the most optimal natural Sendai virus binders curve A of Fig. 4 exist generally in epithelial cells. As an illustration, Fig. 7 shows the result from an analysis of epithelial cells of small intestine of four human individuals of different blood group phenotypes. While, as expected, the slow moving blood group fucolipids vary between the samples, they have the receptor type glycolipids in common. Therefore, all cells which the virus invades when infecting an organism contain the second step receptor. Non epithelial cells have much lower amounts or may practically lack these receptor glycolipid species. Contrary to what has previously been held to be the case, erythrocytes used for hemolysis penetration assay contain the receptors in that small but definite amounts of GalßCer and GlcßCer with 2 hydroxy acid have been found on human, bovine and porcine erythrocytes. The general structural characteristics of the epithelial surface membrane of which the receptor glycolipids are an important part are relevant in the the present context. A specific feature of the sphingolipid with its varying number of hydroxyl groups of the ceramide is the combined hydrogen bond donor and acceptor capacity Fig. 8 making up one of three defined zones of the membrane see reference 33 . This is probably of decisive importance to membrane stability which depends on a laterally oriented network of hydrogen bonds. The data on the cell surface membrane available at present make it seem likely that the virus has developed a binding property which interferes with this stability through specific interaction with all three parts of an essential component of this network. A number of synthetic substances shown in Table 1 were analyzed for virus binding in the two assays described in Materials and Methods. Table 5 summarizes the semiquantitative binding results from over layering of Sendai virus to dilutions of the substance in question. The signs do not correspond to those of Table 3 or 4 but are only for relative comparison with in Table 5. As shown, there is weak binding to No. 12, but not to Nos. 11, 13 or 14, indicating some preference for Glcß. The two chain compounds are better binders compare 15 with 13 . However, most importantly, the sulphono analogues, Nos. 16 18, bind most strongly, the two chain compounds being preferred. A more precise quantification by means of the quantitative binding assay described above shows that No. 18 has the same avidity as the corresponding natural receptor, No. 3 of Table 3, both represented by curve C in Fig. 4. These substances were designed on the basis of the research done on the natural receptors, and it is interesting to note that the properties and dimensions of the natural epitope Example 3 and the specifications of receptor analogues are completely satisfied with these substances. Thus, the requirements to parts A, B and C as explained above and their relative dimensions are met although part B is non chiral and carries one or two sulphono groups instead of a chiral part with an amide linkage and two hydroxyls. Evidently, the α side of the sugar is available for binding, which is the requirement outlined in Example 3. For these analogues, this is explained by the sulphono groups giving four onyl sites which by repulsion and possibly hydrogen bonding to water produce a much less dense packing of the molecules in the monolayer of the assays. It further appears from Table 5 that several other synthetic substances do not bind the virus. This is due either to incomplete fulfilment of the requirements for B substances Nos. 11, 13 and 14 which may be compared with substances Nos. 1, 3 and 4, respectively, of Table 3, which are good binders , or to close chain packing making the presentation of the α side of A impossible in the absence of a conformation determining factor like the 2 hydroxy fatty acid of the natural receptor. Gal, Glc and Galß1 4Glc in free form or derivatized or coupled to BSA substances 1 6 and 10 of Table 5 were used in attempts to inhibit Sendai virus binding to receptors using mixtures of glycolipids as shown in Fig. 2, but also pure substances Nos. 1, 2 and 3 of Table 3 on thin layer plates by preincubating the virus with the sugars before layering on the plate. There was no tendency of weakening of the autoradiographic spots, indicating that these substances were incapable of competing with the receptors for binding. The conclusion is that the carbohydrate part of the natural receptor substances in univalent or multivalent form is not in itself able to bind to the virus. Similarly, there was no inhibition in the microtiter assay using substance 3 of Table 3 as the receptor. Preincubating Sendai virus with sonicated micelles of various membrane lipids gave a clear inhibition of virus binding on thin layer plates for several glycolipids of Table 3. Also, in the plaque inhibition test, a rabies virus strain was shown to be completely inhibited by carefully sonicated liposomes containing substance 3 of Table 3. At similar dilution in the titration, liposomes containing phosphatidylserine gave no reduction of plaques. Preincubation of Sendai virus with soluble receptor analogues substances 7 9 of Table 5 before overlayering of virus on a thin layer plate, or incubation in wells, gave the following results. Sendai virus 60 µg and substance 9 1 mg in 2 ml of PBS were preincubated for 1 hour at room temperature before overlayering on a thin layer plate and incubation and working up as described in Materials and Methods, followed by autoradiography to detect bound virus. The glycolipid samples applied to the plate were total gangliosides of human erythrocytes first step receptor, see Example 1 , and glycolipids 1, 2, 3 and 5 of Table 3, in addition to several suitable negative controls. Compared to the control plate binding of virus without preincubation with substance 9 of Table 5 , there was a significant reduction of virus binding after preincubation with substance 9, evaluated on the basis of the dark areas on the autoradiogram becoming lighter. Thus, binding to the glycolipids 1, 2 and 3 was reduced several times and the band for glycolipid 5 disappeared altogether. On the contrary, there was no effect on the binding to the first step receptor erythrocyte gangliosides, compare Fig. 1 . Similar preincubations with 1 mg ml of substances 7 and 8 gave no visible inhibition of virus binding. The conclusion from these experiments with the overlay assay is that the synthetic receptor analogue in multivalent form substance 9 of Table 5 , but not in univalent form substances 7, and 8 of Table 5 , is able to produce a selective inhibition of binding to the second step receptor without having any effect on binding to the first step receptor. Preincubations of Sendai virus with these soluble receptor analogues using microtIter wells and an ELISA assay see Materials and Methods gave the following results. Preincubation with substance 9 of Table 5 gave a reduction of virus binding to the second step receptor GalßCer A₄₉₂ 0.350 as a typical value at the highest concentration with a return to the maximum level after three 1 4 dilutions, see Materials and Methods . There was no inhibitory effect on the binding of virus to coated antiserum and there was no inhibition by preincubation with univalent analogue substances 7 and 8 . The results therefore coincide with those from the overlay assay above with a selective inhibition of binding to the second step receptor, but not to the antibody, and a need for multivalency in order for the analogue to be effective.
