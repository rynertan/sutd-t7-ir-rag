# Radiographic intensifying screen and process for the preparation of the same.

## Abstract
A radiographic intensifying screen comprising a support and a phosphor containing resin layer provided thereon, in which the void ratio of said phosphor containing resin layer is reduced in comparison with an ordinarily prepared phosphor containing resin layer having the same binder phosphor ratio and formed by a coating procedure con ducted under an atmospheric pressure. The void ratio is not more than 85 of the void ratio of the ordinarily prepared phosphor containing resin layer for a phosphor containing resin layer in which contains a resinous binder and a phosphor in a weight ratio of 1 1 to 1 25, the ratio of 1 25 being exclusive, and the void ratio is not more than 90 for a phosphor containing resin layer in which contains a resinous binder and a phosphor in a weight ratio of 1 25 to 1 100.
