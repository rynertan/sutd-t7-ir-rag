## Description
DESCRIPTION PYRAZOLE DERIVATIVES AND PISWUMACEUTICAI, CONPOS IT IONS CONTAINING THEM The px eserlt invention relates to novel pyrazole derivatives having excellent antilipemic activity and suitable for use in the treatment of lipemia. Although several antilipemic pharmaceutical agents have been proposed for use in the treatment of lipemia, they suffer the common defect of exhibiting side effects upon long term administration. For instance, clofibrate which has been widely administered as an antilipemic agent causes diseases in the biliary duct and there is the possibility that clofibrate may cause cancers. Further, pharmaceutical compositions comprising nicotinic acid are only rarely used because of the large dosages required and the side effect of causing flushing and eruptions on the face and skin of the patient being treated. After synthesizing and testing various compounds we have found that pyrazole derivatives of the general formula I shown below have excellent antilipemic activity. Pyrazole derivatives of the general formula 11 EMI1.1 wherein R7 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group and R8 represents an alkyl group of 3 to 11 carbon atoms, are known, and their synthesis and their physical and chemical properties have been reported by Keshin, H et al. Istanbul Univ. Fen. Fak. Mecum.Seric., 34, 95 108, 1969 , but without mention of any pharmacological properties. Although Kupiecki F. et al reported that 5 methylpyrazol e 3 carboxylic acid can reduce the level of lipid in human blood refer toJ. Pharmacol. Expt. Therap., 160, 166, 1968 , Lang P.D.et al subsequently reported that its clinical effectiveness was not decisive and its use caused side effects such as hypolycemia, rendering it unsuitable for use in treating lipemia refer to Arzneim. Forsch., 25 1 , 117, 1975 . Accordingly, the fact that the pyrazole derivatives of the present invention have excellent antilipemic activity and that they could safely be used in the treatment of lipemia was not to be expected from the prior art. The pyrazole derivatives of the present invention are represented by the general formula I EMI2.1 wherein RÚ represents an alkyl group of 7 to 17 carbon atoms, Rê represents a hydrogen atom, a lower preferably C1 C, alkyl group or a phenyl group, R3 representsEMI2.2 or CH2 OH whereinR4 represents a hydrogen atom or a lower preferably C1 C4 alkyl group, R5 represents CH2CH2OH orEMI3.1 wherein R6 represents a hydroxyl group or a lower preferably C1 C4 alkoxy group, with the proviso that when R represents an alkyl group of 7 to 11 carbon atoms and R2 represents a hydrogen atom, R3 does not representEMI3.2 Examples of pyrazole derivatives of formula I hereinafter referred to as the present pyrazole derivatives are 5 n tridecylpyrazole 3carboxylic acid, 5 n pentadecylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, 5 n heptadecylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, ethyl 5 n tridecylpyrazole 3 carboxylate, ethyl 5 n pentadecylpyrazole 3 carboxylate, ethyl 5 n heptadecylpyrazole 3 carboxylate, 3 N 2 1 hydroxyethylcarbamoyl 5 n nonylpyrazole, 3 N 2ff hydroxyethylcarbamoyl 5 n undecylpyrazole, 3 N 2 hydroxyethylcarbamoyl 5 ntridecylpyrazole, 3 N hydroxycarbonylmethylcarbamoyl5 n nonylpyrazole, 3 N hydroxycarbonylmethylcarbamoyl5 n undecylpyrazole, 3 N hydroxycarbonylmethyl 5 ntridecylpyrazole, 3 N ethoxycarbonylmethylcarbamoyl 5n nonylpyrazole, 3 N ethoxycarbonylmethylcarbamoyl 5n undecylpyrazole, 3 N ethoxycarbon,ylmethylcarbamoyl 5 n tridecylpyrazole, 3 hydroxymethyl 5 n tridecylpyrazole, 3 hydroxymethyl 5 n heptylpyrazole, 3 hydroxymethyl 5 n nonylpyrazole, 3 hydroxymethyl 5 nundecylpyrazole, l methyl 5 n tridecylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, l methyl 5 n heptapyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, l methyl 5 n nonylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, l methyl n undecylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, 1 phenyl5 n nonylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, l phenyl 5 nheptylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid, l phenyl 5 n undecyl pyrazole 3 carboxylic acid and l phenyl 5 n tridecy1 pyrazole 3 carboxylic acid.

The total dosage of each compound was such that each animal received 300 mg kg of each compound as free carboxylic acid.The rats of the control group were given the aqueous 1 solution of CMC only, in three doses at the same intervals as the test groups. All the groups were fed with the same diet during the test period. After 48 hours of the commencement of the test, a blood sample was collected from each animal by amputation of the carotid artery, and serum was separated from the blood sample and frozen to be kept until lipid analysisLipid analysis Serum triglyceride was determined by Acetyl acetone Method, and the reduction percentage of lipid was calculated on the basis of the following formula 1 amount of triqlyceride in serum of test animal x 100 amount of triglyceride in serum of control the reduction percentage of lipid wherein the reduction percentage is the average for the test animals in each group.Analysis for serum cholesterol The content of serum cholesterol was determined by an enzymatic method using cholesteroloxidase, and the reduction percentage of cholesterol was calculated according to the following formula 1 amount of cholesterol in serum of test animal amount of cholesterol in serum of control , v the reduction percentage of cholesterol The results of the analyses are shown in Table 1.

The administered amount of each compound was 2.5 g kg body weight or 5.0 g kg, and from the triortalities at both levels, LD 50 was roughly calculated and compared with LD50 of nicotinic acid. The following description is an explanation of formulating the present pyrazole derivatives into pharmaceutical compositions. In general1 the present pyrazole derivative can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition of dose unit form by known techniques.

After drying, the particles were sifted by screening machine provided with a sieve having a sieve opening of 500 microns 32 mesh Tyler standard . The particles passing through the sieve were mixed with 3 g of talc and 2 g of magnesium stearate and the mixture was pressed in a rotary tabletting machine into tablets each 9 mm in diameter and 300 mg in weight. EXAMPLE 27 Particles were prepared by the same procedure as in Example 26, but using ethyl 5 n tridecylpyrazole3 carboxylate instead of the acid itself used in Example 26, and the particles were capsulated in No. 1 hard capsules by using a capsulating machine at a rate of 300 mg capsule. The pyrazole derivatives of general formula I can in general be prepared by reacting a sodium enolate of the formulaEMI38.1 wherein R7 represents a lower alkyl group with hydrazine hydrate or a hydrazine sulfate of the formula R NH2.1128O4 to form a 5 alkylpyrazole 3 carboxylic acid or an alkyl ester thereof of the formulaEMI38.2 wherein R4 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group, and if desired, when R4 is lower alkyl converting the alkyl ester to the corresponding acid wherein R4 is hydrogen by hydrolysis or to a pyrazole derivative in which R3 is CH2OH by reduction, or when R4 is hydrogen. converting the carboxylic acid to a pyrazole derivati,yeftn which R3 is EMI38.3 by forming the acid chloride from the carboxylic acid and reacting the acid chloride with an amine derivative of the 5 formula NH2R or a hydrochloride thereof or to the alkyl ester wherein R4 is lower alkyl by esterification.
