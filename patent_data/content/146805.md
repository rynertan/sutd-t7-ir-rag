# Electric circuit breaker with improved contact structure.

## Abstract
This invention relates generally to electric circuit breakers and, more particularly, to an improved contact structure especially for use in molded case circuit breakers having small dimensions but relatively high interrupting capacities and current limiting capability. The contact structure of the currently preferred embodiment comprises an elongate stationary conductor 62 and an electrically conductive contact arm 66 which together, form a pivotal connection 62F G and 78 designed to facilitate the assembly of the structure in a small space and to provide good current transfer between the stationary conductor and the contact arm. The contact structure further includes springs 68 which maintain both pivotal engagement and contact pressure between the parts 62F G, 78 forming the pivotal connection. The stationary conductor has a terminal portion 38B formed integral therewith, and has a stop surface 62J coacting with a stop portion 68 of the contact arm 66 to prevent movement of the latter beyond a position of initial contact engagement with respect to a movable companion contact 308 forming part of the complete contact means of the circuit breaker.
