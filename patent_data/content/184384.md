The present invention also relates to antibacterial compositions comprising an antibacterially acceptable carrier and a compound of formula I. Preferred compositions are those wherein the compound of formula I is a preferred compound as described above. The term polyhaloalkyl when used in the definition of R3 means an alkyl having more than one halogen. Examples of such polyhaloalkyl groups are dichioromethyl, aibromoethyl, perfluoropropyl. The term halo or halogen whenever used in the claims and the description, e.g. in the definition ofR3, means fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. The compounds of formula I may be prepared by transition metal catalyst coupling of an appropriate arylmetallic compound containing group R3 as defined above with the appropriate 7 R quinolinone ester of the formula II EMI6.1 wherein R2 and Y are as defined above, R is alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms and R5 is bromo or iodo. The coupling reaction is carried out in a reaction inert solvent, i.e. a solvent which does not interfere with the coupling reaction of the arylmetallic compound with the compound of formula II.Suitable reaction inert solvents are ethers, e.g.dialkylethers such as diethylether and dipropylether, dimethoxyethane, and cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran THF . Cosolvents may be used with the ethers, if desired, e.g. to enhance the solubility therein of the reaction materials. Examples of suitable cosolvents are aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons of 5 to 10 carbon atoms such as benzene and toluene. Other suitable cosolvents are cosolvent complexing agents such as tetramethylethylenediamine TMEDA and hexamethylphosphonictriamide HMPA as known to those skilled in the art. The arylmetallic compounds containing group R3 may be prepared by known methods. For instance, they may be prepared from the corresponding halide of formula R3R5 nn which R3 and R5 are as defined above by direct lithium halogen exchange using n butyl, sec butyl or t butyl lithium followed by transmetallation by a wide variety of salts by known methods such as described byE. Negishi, Organometallics in Organic Synthesis, Vol.1, page 104. The salts used in the transmetallation may be selected from the salts of zinc, cadmium, magnesium, mercury, tin, silver, copper, boron and aluminum, preferably zinc. The most commonly used salts are the halides, particularly chlorides, bromides, and odides, and cyanides such as copper cyanide. The most advantageous salt is zinc chloride. The above treatment with a butyl lithium compound is generally carried out at 78 to 50 C, in a suitable solvent such as ethçrfs alone or in admixture with an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvent having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms. Suitable ethers are for instance dialkylethers such as diethylether, cyclic ethers such as THF, and dimethoxyethane. Suitable hydrocarbon solvents are for instance toluene and benzene. The treatment with the butyl lithium is best carried out inTHF at 780C. The arylmetallic compounds may also be prepared by direct reaction of the corresponding arylhalide with a metal in the zerovalent state. These metals are alkali metals such as lithium, sodium and potassium, alkaline earth metals such as magnesium, and transition metals such as zinc. The reaction temperatures may range from 1000C for very active metals to 100 C. Again, solvents of use in this process are ethers alone or in admixture with hydrocarbons having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms such that at least one equivalent of the ether is present. Alternatively, the arylmetallic compounds may be formed by hydrogen metal exchange between a corre sponding aryl compound and a strong base such as t butoxide butyl lithium, TMEDA butyllithium, or lithium or potassium hexamethyldisilizane. The arylmetallic compound is generally not isolated before reaction by coupling with compound II . The coupling of the arylmetallic compound with the 7 haloquinolinone ester of formula II is in the presence of a transition metal catalyst usually in an amount of 0.5 10 mole . The transition metal catalyst may be of the 0 or II oxidation state and contains a transition metal, that is a metal selected from Groups Ib through Vilib and VIII of the PeriodicTable as set out in Lange s Handbook of Chemistry, 11thEdition. Suitable metals are for instance platinum, cobalt, iron, zirconium, molybdenum, ruthenium, manganese and rhodium, and preferred metals are palladium, platinum and nickel. The transition metal is combined with a ligand to form the catalyst. Suitable known ligands are phosphorus containing ligands such as PPh3, P CH3 3, P C2H5 3 P o tolyl 3, P o xylyl 3, Ph2P CH2 n PPh2 wherein n is an integer from 1 to 4, and C113 2 P CH2 2P CH3 2 or cis Ph2CH CHPh2, acetonylacetonate, 2,2 bipyridyl pyridine and others as described in Tamao et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 49 7 , 1959 1976 . Other transition metal catalysts are disclosed in A. Sekiya et al., J. Organometal. Chem., 118, 349 354 1976 andE. Negishi, Acc. Chem. Res., 15, 340 348 1982 and references cited therein. Ph is phenyl. The preferred transition metal catalysts are 3 2 NiHal2, PPh3 4 Ni, PPh3 PdHal2, and PPh3 4 Pd wherein Hal is chloro, bromo or iodo and Dh is phenyl. The most preferred catalyst is tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium. For the preparation of compounds wherein R2 and Y are taken together, the preferred catalyst is PPh3 2NiCl2. The reaction temperature of the coupling process generally ranges from room temperature to 50 CC. Methods for the preparation of the compounds of formula II are analogous to those described in the art. The overall reactions of two methods analgous to those in the prior art are set out in reaction Schemes A andB hereafter. In Scheme A, an aniline of formula IV wherein R2 and R5 are as defined above is reacted with a dialkyl alkoxymethylene malonate of formula V wherein R is an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or benzyl. The reaction is generally carried out without solvent at about 100 to 2000C, preferably 150 to 1750C, for about 0.5 to 24 hours, usually for 0.5 to 2 hours. The resulting intermediates of formula VI are crystallized from a hydrocarbon or ethereal solvent such as light petroleum or diethyl ether and cyclized by heating at about 150 to 2500C in high boiling solvents such as dichlorobenzene, tetralin, diphenylether or diethyleneglycol dimethylether, preferably Dowtherm A which is a commercially available high boiling solvent mixture of diphenylether and dibenzofuran. The reaction time ranges from about 0.5 to 12 hours. The intermediates of formula VII formed above areN substituted with a halide Y Hal wherein Y is as defined above and Hal is halogen. Examples of suitable halides are ethyliodide, 2 fluoro l iodoethane, allylbromide and 2 bromoethanol. The adduct formed on reaction with 2 bromoethanol may be converted to a compound of formula I wherein Y is vinyl by hydroxyl activation with e.g. thionyl chloride followed by elimination with a suitable base such as triethylamine, diazabicycloundecene and diazabicyclononane.Generally, the substitution is carried out in DMF with an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate temperatures ranging from room temperature to 1100C. This reaction similarly proceeds when R5 in formula VII is replaced by R3 as defined before to produce the compounds of formula I provided that R in compounds VII is R1 as defined above except R1 is hydrogen requiring an additional hydrolysis step. The mono or did For anilines of formula IV, also used in the reaction of Scheme B hereafter, may be prepared by conventional nitration and reduction methods from the corresponding fluorobenzenes which are commerically available. Scheme AEMI11.1 In Scheme B, an aniline of formula X wherein R2 R5 and Y are as defined above is reacted with a dialkyl alkoxymethylene malonate of formula V wherein each 2 is alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or benzyl. The reaction conditions are as described above with reference to the conversion of compounds IV into V in Scheme A. The cyclization of compound XI fo rmed above is by heating in an acidic medium such as polyphosphoric acid at about 100 to 2500C for about 0.5 to 24 hours, preferably at 100 to 1500C for 0.5 to 2 hours. This procedure is described by Albrecht, R., Prog. DrugRes., Vol. 21, 35 49 1977 . The resulting ester of formula II is usually purified by recrystallization or chromatography. The compounds of formula X may be prepared from those of formula IV by conventional methods. For instance, in Scheme B, an aniline of formula IV may be reacted with acetic anhydride in ethanol at about 25 to 100 C. The formed compound of formula VIII is reacted with a suitable base such as sodium hydride and N substituted with an appropriate halide, tosylate or mesylate containing group Y. The acetyl group in the formed compound of formula IX is removed by refluxing in aqueous medium such as 6N hydrochloric acid to form the compound of formula X. Alternatively, N substituted anilines of formula X may be formed by reductive amination with an appropriate aldehyde and a suitable reducing agent such as diborane, palladium on carbon with hydrogen, sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride Scheme BEMI13.1 or by acylation of said aniline of formula IV by reaction with the appropriate anhydride or acid chloride and direct reduction to anilines X with diborane in THF. The initial N substitution of formula IV in SchemeB, rather than the later one of compounds of formulaVII in Scheme A, is particularly useful when Y is polyfluoroalkyl since substitution with polyfluoroalkyl halides is not a viable route. The intermediates of formula II wherein R2 and Y are taken together to form tricyclic compounds are prepared by the methods of Schemes C to H hereafter. The initial compound used in these methods is 2,4 difluoro 3 bromo l nitrobenzene formed from 1,3difluoro 2 bromobenzene by conventional nitration. Scheme C shows the preparation of tricyclic intermediates of formula XVII having a five membered third ring in which R4 is as defined above. SCHEME CEMI15.1 2 4 Difluoro 3 bromonitrobenzene is reacted with a reagent of the formulaEMI16.1 wherein Z is sulfur, oxygen, NH or NCH3, in a polar organic solvent such as THF. When Z is sulfur, the reaction requires the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine. When Z is oxygen, a base such as sodium hydride is required for the reaction.Triethylamine, pyridine or another base is required when Z is NF or NCH3 when only one equivalent of the above reagent is used. The compound of formula XII is selectively reduced to the corresponding aniline by catalytic hydrogenation or by chemical reduction such as with stannous chloride in ethanol. After condensation of XIII with diethylethoxymethylene malonate at about 1500C, the compound of formula XIV is formed. Ring cyclization of XIV is by heating with e.g. Dowtherm A as the solvent. The substituted benzyl group is removed under acidic conditions e.g. with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid and anisole.
