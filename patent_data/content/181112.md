# CONTROLLER FOR BATTERY CHARGER

## Abstract
A controller for a battery charger 21 for terminating charging of a battery 22 as a function of a time derivative of measured battery voltage. There are analog and ditigal embodiments of the controller. Means 23,24 determine a time derivative of the measured battery voltage and a change in slope of the time derivative, and means 27,28 use said change in slope as a control function for the battery charger.
