# Light sensitive compositions using rhodopsin and light activatable enzymes.

## Abstract
A light sensitive composition comprising 1 a plurality of vesicles comprising lipid membranes containing rhodopsin 2 a mixture of enzymes comprising phosphodiesterase and GTPase 3 a first nucleotide capable of interacting with GTPase to form a cofactor for the activation of phosphodi esterase 4 at least one metal cation selected from Mg ² and Mn ² 5 a second nucleotide capable of being hydrolyzed to produce a proton, said hydrolysis reaction being ca talyzed by activated phosphodiesterase, said phos phodiesterase also being activated by rhodopsin ex posed by light in the presence of said cofactor and said metal cation and 6 means for detecting protons is useful in preparing photographic elements.
