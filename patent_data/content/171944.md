# Improvements relating to bulk containers.

## Abstract
A flexible bulk container has a side wall structure 1 formed from a length of tubular woven fabric comprising a base fabric and a plurality of parallel reinforcing bands such as 2 to 5 integrally woven with the base fabric and extending parallel to the tube axis. A bottom 26 is stitched to the side wall structure at one end of the fabric length and a top wall structure 24 may be secured at the other end of the fabric length. The container has a plurality of lifting loops 20 to 23 at the top end of the fabric length, each lifting loop being formed by cutting back a portion of the base fabric alongside each of two adjacent reinforcing bands e.g. 3 and 4 to leave parts of the bands projecting from the base fabric, and securing together the free ends of the projecting parts to form the loop e.g. 20 . One of the projecting parts may be twisted through 180 before the free ends are joined together.
