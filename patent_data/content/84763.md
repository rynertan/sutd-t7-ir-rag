## Description
Apparatus for conveying biscuits, and confectionery products in general, towards a wrapping machine The present invention relates to apparatus for conveying biscuits, and confectionery products in general, towards a wrapping machine. These biscuits may be of various types, both with regard to the consistency of the mixture, which may be quite crumbly, and to the possible presence of a filling and or a coating, for example a chocolate coating. In some cases, they may also have granular coatings of, for example,almonds sprinkled on a coating of caramel or jam. Now, there is a need to feed such biscuits to a wrapping machine where the biscuits are individually wrapped in cellophane. Such packages can then be handled easily in the further stages of the production cycle up to consumption. The feeding of the biscuits to a wrapping machine has, until now, encountered the contrasting needs of achieving a high rate of conveyance of the biscuits, as is clearly required in the large scale production of widely consumed products, and at the same time minimising the percentage of biscuits damaged in conveyance this is not only to avoid obvious wastage but also because damaged biscuits result in laborious operations for their removal. These disadvantages are clearly greater the more the biscuits are valued for the preparation of the mixture, the filling, and or the coating. The problem behind the present invention is that of devising apparatus of the type specified which has such structural and functional characteristics as to satisfy the requirement explained in the preamble while overcoming the disadvantages mentioned. This proble m is solved by apparatus of the type specified which is characterised in that it includes a conveyor belt with equally spaced .partitions defining cells, one for each biscuit a plurality of continuous conveyor belts extending above the cellular belt at right angles thereto, and a corresponding plurality of continuous bladed chain conveyors having respective active passes of their blades extending above the continuous belts in the direction of the cellular belt for displacing the biscuits from the continuous belts into respective cells of the cellular belt. To advantage, the apparatus according to the invention includes a plurality of eccentric strikers each located in correspondence with the active pass of the blades of a respective continuous conveyor to strike from above a respective biscuit moved by each blade. Advantageously, the cellular conveyor belt is formed from three belts located side by side, the central belt having a pass which is prolonged relative to the lateral belts and extends into the wrapping machine. One embodiment of the invention is described below, by way of example, with reference to the single appended drawing which is a schematic perspective view of apparatus according to the invention. With reference to the appended drawing, there is generally indicated 1 apparatus for conveying biscuits each indicated 2, towards an entirely conventional type of wrapping machine, schematically indicated 3, in which the biscuits are individualiy wrapped in cellophane. The machine 1 includes a conveyor belt 4 formed by a succession of metal links 5 carrying partitions, each indicated 6, which are equally spaced along the belt 4 to form cells, each indicated 7, defined by adjacent partitions and intended to receive a respective biscuit 2. The distance between the partitions is fixed in relation to the length of the biscuit to be wrapped in cellophane, and to the spacing between the biscuits which is necessary for the heat sealing of the cellophane between the biscuits in the wrapping machine 3. The belt 4 is formed by three belts located sideby side and, in particular, by a central belt 4a and two lateral belts 4b, 4c, the central belt 4a having a longer pass than the lateral belts 4b, 4c and extending into the wrapping machine 3. The apparatus 1 according to the invention includes two continuous conveyor belts, both indicated 8, which are supplied with biscuits 2, each extending above the belt 4 at right angles thereto. The belt 4 and the two belts 8 are supported by a support frame of an entirely conventional type which is not shown in order not to overburden the drawing. A stop 9 is fixed to the frame and is located above each belt 8 in correspondence with the belt 4 to stop the biscuits 2 on the belt 8. On a section between the stop 9 and a photocell 10 supported by the frame , the biscuits 2 are arranged in a continuous line on each belt 8, that is, touching each other, while on the remaining section the biscuits are generally spaced from each other. Each belt 8 is provided with a respective continuous conveyor belt 11 located upstream thereof. Each belt 11 is supplied with biscuits from a respective production unit, such as a baking oven or a unit in which the biscuits are, for example, coated with chocolate , and in its turn supplies the respective belt 8. Each photocell 10 controls the speed of the respective belt 11 in an entirely conventional manner so that the section between the stop 9 and the photocell 10 is always filled with a continuous line of biscuits 2. All the belts 8, 11 are provided with guide strips for the biscuits along the belts themselves. The apparatus 1 according to the present invention includes two bladed chain conveyors 12 with blades 13, each with the active pass of its blades extending above a respective continuous belt 8 in the direction of the belt 4. Two eccentric strikers 14 are each located in correspondence with the end of an active pass of the blades 13 of a respective conveyor 12, each striker 14 having a circular trajectory so as to strike from above each biscuit conveyed by the blades 13. The operation of the apparatus 1 according to the invention is described below. As the biscuits on each belt 8, which advances in the direction of the arrow F, come to bear against the stop 9, they are displaced transversely one at a time by a blade 13, which advances in the direction of the arrow G, until they leave the belt B laterally.From the belts 8, the biscuits fall onto the belt 4 which advances in the direction of the arrow H at substantially the same speed as the blades 13.The two continuous bladed chain conveyors 12 with the blades 13 are driven in phase with the advance of the belt 4, so that the biscuits fall from the belts 8 exactly into respective alternate cells 7 of the belt 4. The fall and, in particular, the detachment of each biscuit 2 from the blade 13 which has displaced it are facilitated by the presence of the eccentric strikers 14 which,driven in phase with the blades 13, strike each biscuit 2 from above at the moment the blade 13 reaches the end of its active pass. Each biscuit 2 is thus conveyed by the belt 4 towards the machine 3 and finally, from the central belt 4a, into the machine 3 there it is wrapped in cellophane. It sibuld be noted that,in the example illustrated, the apparatus 1 includes two continuous belts 8 with their respective chain conveyors 12 and associated members,but any apparatus in which there is any number of belts 8 withtheirrespective conveyors 12 and associated members, for example three or more, falls within the scope of the invention. In the apparatus according to the invention, each biscuit is subjected individually to the force necessary for its conveyance and, from the belt 8 to the machine 3,is transported positively,first by the blades 13 and then in the cells 7. This results in a minimum of damage to the biscuits and avoids the accumulation of crumbs and particles which may become detached from the biscuits andmay be sticky. From what has been described above,it is clear that, in the apparatus according to the invention,the cellular belt 4 may even have quite a high speed since it is fed by a plurality of continuous belts 8 and that consequently the blades 13may have an equally high speed without any faltering of the biscuits 2 at this stage during their fall onto the belt 4.By virtue of this high speed of the blades 13 the time for which the biscuits 2 remain in contact with the stops 9 is rendered as short as possible, which is of advantage to their integrity. By virtue of the apparatus according to the invention, there is thus achieved the important advantage of conveying biscuits towards a wrapping machine at a high rate, without damage to the biscuits.
