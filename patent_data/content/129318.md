# Neutralization of alkali metal catalysts in organopolysiloxanes.

## Abstract
A process for the neutralization of the alkali metal catalyst in a polymerized organopolysiloxane, where the alkali metal content of the resuting organopolysiloxane is significantly reduced, is described. The process consists of neutralizing the alkali metal salt with a straight chain carboxylic acid of gen eral formula ZCOOH, where Z is a hydrocarbon group contain ing at least two carbon atoms, and thereafter filtering the organopolysiloxane. The same ZCOOH carboxylic acids may be added to organopolysiloxanes which have previously been neutralized with either carbon dioxide or acetic acid in order to significantly reduce the alkali metal content of the organopolysiloxane after filtration. Organopolysiloxanes containing less than 0.5 ppm K can be easily obtained.
