# Method of preparing asymmetric membranes.

## Abstract
Asymmetric integral polymer membranes comprising a skin and a porous support having a reticulated structure are prepared by casting a polymer dope while said dope is in a turbid metastable liquid dispersion condition, the concentra tion of polymer in said polymer dope being high enough to produce a coherent membrane yet low enough to form said reticulated structure.
