# Method for production of a thallium carrying target material.

## Abstract
A method for production of a thallium carrying target material comprising a thermo conductive support and metallic thallium electro plated thereon, which comprises applying a DC AC overlapped electric current between an anode made of a metal or its alloy having lower ionization tendency than hydrogen and the electro conductive support as a cathod, both electrodes being immersed in a bath of an electro plating solution comprising monovalent thallium ions in the presence of at least one of aromatic amines and phenols, so as to deposit the thallium metal on the surface of the thermo conductive support.
