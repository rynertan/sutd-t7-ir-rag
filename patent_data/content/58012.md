# Chain saw chain sharpening device.

## Abstract
A saw chain sharpening device is provided which is releasably attachable to a portable chain saw to enable routing type saw chain cutters 43 to be sharpened in situ on the chain saw guide bar 2 . The sharpening device compris es a support bridge 4 clampable to the saw guide bar 2 in a position straddling one pass of the chain 3 . This bridge 4 supports a grinding wheel mounting arrangement 11 15 which can be set up to orientate a grinding wheel 16 carried thereby into the plane of the routing edge face of a cutter 43 to be sharpened. Once correctly orientated, the grinding wheel 16 is driven in rotation by external means such as a conventional electric drill 19 and approached towards the cutter 43 along a path lying in said plane. This path is defined by a linear guide 13 of the mounting arrangement, the guide 13 being slanted at the undercut angle of the cutter face.
