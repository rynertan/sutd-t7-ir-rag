## Description
This invention relates to a resin composition comprising a polyphenylene oxide resin or a resin composition containing a polyphenylene oxide and a copolymer of an olefin and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate. Polyphenylene oxides are well known polymers with excellent thermal, mechanical and electrical properties, but on the other hand, poor in workability and low in impact strength. For these reasons these polymers usually are not used singly but offered to the market in the form of a composite with other resins. The resins used for forming a composite with polyphenylene oxide need be those having good compatibility with this substance, but such resins are limited. Presently known as such resins in the art are only polystyrene resins which are commercially available from the General Electric Co. under the name of Noryl resins. Therefore, development of novel substances usable as a composite material with polyphenylene oxides will open up a new market and will have a great commercial significance. DE A 2119371 discloses a thermoplastic resin composition comprising The present inventors have found that a copolymer of an olefin and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate has good compatibility with polyphenylene oxide, and this invention was attained on the basis of such finding. An object of this invention is to provide a novel resin composition containing a polyphenylene oxide, which has been improved in its processability, impact resistance and oil resistance. Another object of this invention is to provide a novel resin composition containing a polyphenylene oxide, which has been improved in its adhesiveness towards inorganic fillers such as glass fibers, calcium carbonate, silica or titanium oxide without lowering the physical properties of the composition containing such fillers. Other objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following description. According to the present invention, there is provided a novel resin composition comprising A a polyphenylene oxide resin or a resin composition containing a polyphenylene oxide and B a copolymer of an olefin and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate. The polyphenylene oxide resin referred to in this invention is a polymer obtainable by subjecting at least one of the phenol compounds represented by the general formula wherein R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ are each selected from hydrogen, halogen atoms, hydrocarbon groups and substituted hydrocarbon groups, and at least one of them is always hydrogen atom to an oxidative polymerization with oxygen or a free oxygen containing gas by using an oxidative coupling catalyst. Specific examples of R¹, R², R³, R⁴ and R⁵ in the above shown general formula, are the following hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, fluorine, iodine, methyl, ethyl, n or iso propyl, pri , sec. or t butyl, chloroethyl, hydroxyethyl, phenylethyl, benzyl, hydroxymethyl, carboxyethyl, methoxycarbonylethyl, cyanoethyl, phenyl, chlorophenyl, methylphenyl, dimethylphenyl, ethylphenyl and aryl.

It is also possible to use mixtures with other phenol compounds than those represented by the above shown general formula, for example, polyvalent hydroxy aromatic compounds such as bisphenol A, tetrabromobisphenol A, resorcin, hydroquinone or Novalac resins. Most preferred among the polyphenylene oxides are homopolymers of 2,6 dimethylphenol or 2,6 diphenylphenol and copolymers consisting of a major proportion of 2,6 xylenol and a minor proportion of 3 methyl 6 t butylphenol or 2,3,6 trimethylphenol. The oxidative coupling catalyst used for effecting oxidative polymerization of a phenol compound is not limited to a specific type it is possible to use all types of catalysts having the required polymerizing ability.

The polyphenylene oxide resins usable in this invention also include those comprising said polyphenylene oxide grafted with a styrene polymer or other type of polymer. As for the preparation of these polyphenylene oxide resins, there may be employed, for example, a method in which a styrene polymer and or other polymerizable monomer are subjected to an organic peroxide graft polymerization in the presence of polyphenylene oxide, as for example shown in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 47826 72, 12197 73, 5623 74, 38596 77 and 30991 77, and a method in which said polyphenylene oxide, a polystyrene polymer and a radical forming agent are mixed and melted together as for instance taught in Japanese Patent Application Kokai Laid Open No. 142799 77. The term resin compositions containing a polyphenylene oxide means compositions consisting of said polyphenylene oxide and another high molecular compound. Examples of said other high molecular compounds include polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene propylene block copolymers, polymethylpentene, and ethylene α olefin copolymers the homopolymers and copolymers of various vinyl compounds such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylpyridine, polyvinylcarbazole, polyacrylamide, polyacrylonitrile, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers and alkenyl aromatic resins such compounds as polycarbonates, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyarylene esters for example, U polymers available from Unitika Ltd. and polyphenylene sulfide polyamides such as 6 nylon, 6,6 nylon and 12 nylon condensation high molecular compounds such as polyacetals, and rubbery polymers. It is also possible to use various kinds of thermosetting resins such as silicone resins, phenolic resins, alkyd resins, unsaturated polyester resins, epoxy resins and Dapon resins. The mixing ratio of polyphenylene oxide to the other high molecular compound may be selected from a wide range in which the amount of polyphenylene oxide and the other high molecular compound are variable from 1 to 99 and 99 to 1 by weight, respectively. The optimum ratio is decided according to the type of the product to be obtained and the intended purpose of use. It is easy for those skilled in the art to determine such optimum ratio. Among said other high molecular compounds, the following are preferred polyolefins, polyamides, alkenyl aromatic resins, rubber modified alkenyl aromatic resins and rubbery polymers. Most preferred are alkenyl aromatic resins, rubber modified alkenyl aromatic resins and rubbery polymers. The alkenyl aromatic resins used in this invention are selected from those containing at least 25 by weight of the polymer units derived from the monomers of the general formula wherein R is hydrogen, a lower alkyl group for example, an alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms or a halogen, Z is hydrogen, a vinyl group, a halogen or a hydroxyl group, and P is 0 or an integer of 1 to 5 . Examples of such alkenyl aromatic resins are homopolymers such as polystyrene, polychlorostyrene, poly α methylstyrene, or copolymers thereof, and styrene containing copolymers such as styrene acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene divinylbenzene copolymer and styrene acrylonitrile α methylstyrene copolymer. Among them, homopolystyrene, styrene α methylstyrene copolymer, styrene acrylonitrile copolymer and styrene methyl methacrylate copolymer are preferred, and homopolystyrene is most preferred. The rubber modified alkenyl aromatic resin referred to in this invention is a two phase resin in which the rubber particles stay dispersed in an alkenyl aromatic resin matrix. Such rubber modified alkenyl aromatic resin may be prepared by mechanically mixing a rubber material such as enumerated below and an alkenyl aromatic resin, or by dissolving said rubber material in an alkenyl aromatic monomer and then polymerizing said monomer. The latter method is employed industrially for the production of so called impact resistant polystyrene. The preparations obtained by mixing rubber and or an alkenyl aromatic resin in the product obtained from the latter method are also included in the rubber modified alkenyl aromatic resins in this invention. The rubbery polymers referred to herein means the natural and synthetic polymers which are elastic at room temperatures, such as 20 25 C. Examples thereof are natural rubber, diene rubber such as polybutadiene, polyisoprene and polychloroprene and copolymers of a diene and a vinyl monomer such as styrene butadiene random copolymers, styrene butadiene block copolymers, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, polybutadiene styrene graft copolymers, butadiene acrylonitrile copolymers , polyisobutylene and copolymers of isobutylene and butadiene or isoprene, ethylene propylene copolymers, Thiokol rubber, polysulfide rubber, acrylic rubber, polyurethane rubber, polyether rubber and epichlorohydrin rubber. Various modified versions of these rubbers such as hydroxy or carboxy terminated polybutadiene and partially hydrogenated styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers are also included in the rubbery materials usable in this invention. Also, in the cases of a diene rubber and diene and vinyl compound copolymers, those having various types of microstructure of their double bonds such as vinyl groups, cis 1,4 bonds, trans 1,4 bonds, etc. are also usable in this invention. Preferred rubbery polymers among them are copolymers composed of 40 100 by weight of butadiene and 60 0 by weight of styrene, copolymers composed of 65 82 by weight of butadiene and 35 18 by weight of acrylonitrile, styrene butadiene copolymers, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers including linear, radial and other all types of block copolymers , styrene grafted polybutadiene prepared by adding styrene in polybutadiene or butadiene styrene copolymer latex and emulsion polymerizing the mixture with a radical initiator , ethylene propylene copolymers and ethylene propylene diene copolymers. The polyphenylene oxide and an alkenyl aromatic resin and or a rubber modified alkenyl aromatic resin may be mixed in any proportions, but preferably the polyphenylene oxide is used in an amount of 5 by weight or above, more preferably 20 by weight or above. The polyphenylene oxide and a rubbery polymer may be also mixed in any possible proportion, but in case of forming a plastic, the polyphenylene oxide is usually used in an amount of about 50 by weight or above, preferably 70 by weight or above. However, even when the amount of polyphenylene oxide is less than about 50 , there can be obtained a rubbery elastic product, and this product is also one of the useful preparations. Regarding the copolymers of olefins and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate used as component B in this invention, the olefins usable in such copolymers include ethylene, propylene, butene 1, isobutylene, pentene 1, hexene 1, heptene 1, octene 1, dodecene 1 and these olefins may be used either singly or in combination. Among these olefins, most preferred for use in this invention are ethylene and propylene. The copolymers used as component B may be those prepared by any of the copolymerization methods such as random copolymerization, block copolymerization and graft copolymerization. The olefin content in the copolymers of olefins and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate may be within the range of 1 to 99 by weight, but when it is desired to elevate the impact value of the composition of this invention, the preferred range the olefin content in the copolymer is from about 55 to 90 by weight. The mixing proportions of the components A and B in the composition of this invention may be freely selected in accordance with the object of use. For example, the proportion of the components A and B in the composition may be varied within the range of 99.5 0.5 and 0.5 99.5 by weight, respectively. Some preferred examples of such mixing proportions, as determined according to the type of the product to be obtained, are given below. For example, in a composition comprising A a polyphenylene oxide resin or a polyphenylene oxide and an alkenyl aromatic resin and B an olefin and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate, when it is desired to obtain an impact resistant engineering plastic, the preferred content of the component B is from 3 to 30 by weight, more preferably from 5 to 20 by weight. This composition can provide a peerlessly high impact value and suffers no decrease of its impact value after high temperature molding. In the case of a composition consisting of A a polyphenylene oxide resin, an alkenyl aromatic resin and a rubbery polymer and B an olefin and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate, when an impact resistant engineering plastic is to be obtained, the content of the component B is preferably selected from within the range of 0.5 20 by weight, more preferably the range of 1 10 by weight, although this range is variable depending on the amount of the rubbery polymer in the component A . This composition shows a marked improvement of impact strength even though the component B is present in a small proportion in the composition. In a composition comprising, as component A , a polyphenylene oxide resin, or a composition consisting of polyphenylene oxide and an alkenyl aromatic resin or consisting of polyphenylene oxide, an alkenyl aromatic resin and a rubbery polymer, and as component B , a copolymer of an olefin and glycidyl methacrylate and or glycidyl acrylate as well as an inorganic filler such as glass fibers, calcium carbonate, silica, zinc oxide and TiO₂, the content of the component B should preferably be within the range of 1 40 by weight to the sum of the components A and B , more preferably 5 30 by weight. This composition is liable to deterioration of the mechanical properties such as impact strength if it is devoid of the component B , but such problem can be evaded by the presence of the component B . These examples are but exemplification of only a few preferred embodiments of this invention, and needless to say, the mixing proportions of the components A and B can be varied in other various ways in accordance with the type of the product to be obtained and the purpose of use. Further, the copolymer in the component B in the composition of this invention may contain other copolymerizable vinyl compound or compounds such as styrene, vinyl acetate, methyl methacrylate, vinyl chloride, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, α methylstyrene, divinylbenzene, tetrafluoroethylene, difluoroethylene, vinylidene chloride, acylonitrile and acrylic amide. The method for preparing the composition of this invention is not limited to any specific way but conventional processes may be employed. From the industrial standpoint, however, it is desirable to use a method in which the respective components are first dry blended by a suitable means such as a Henschel mixer and then the mixture is melted, further mixed up and extruded. Both temperature and time for the melting and mixing operations are not subject to any specific limitations, but as for the temperature, although it depends on the mixing proportions of the respective components, it is usually within the range of 150 350 C. As regards the mixing means, there may be employed any method which is capable of treating the molten viscous material in a desired way, and such operation may be performed according to either a batch system or a continuous system. Examples of the mixing devices usable for this purpose include Banbury mixers, rolls, extruders and kneaders. In practicing the present invention, it is optional to add a reinforcing material such as glass fibers, carbon fibers, an inorganic or organic filler such as carbon black, silica, TiO₂, and other additives such as plasticizers, stabilizers, fire retardants, dyes and pigments. The reinforcing material used in this invention is a material which, when blended in the composition, helps to increase bending strength, bending modules of elasticity, tensile strength, modulus in tension, heat deformation temperature. Specific examples of such reinforcing material are alumina fibers, carbon fibers, glass fibers, high elasticity polyamide fibers, high elasticity polyester fibers, silicon carbide fibers and titanate whiskers. Such reinforcing material may be blended in any amount capable of deriving the desired reinforcement, but usually it is preferably blended in an amount within the range of about 5 to 100 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of the composition. The most preferred reinforcing filler is glass, particularly glass fiber filaments composed of lime aluminum borosilicate glass which has a relatively small sodium content. Such glass is generally known as E glass . However, for uses where the electrical properties are not of imperative requirement, there may be used other types of glass with low sodium content, such as one generally known as C glass . The filaments may be produced by any suitable known method such as steam or air blowing, flame blowing or mechanical drawing. Mechanical drawing is best suited for obtaining the preferred filaments for plastics reinforcement. The filaments used in this invention are preferably those having a diameter within the range of about 2 20 µ, but such is not critical in this invention. It is also optional in this invention to select any length of the glass filaments or to bundle such filaments and further assemble the bundled fibers into threads, ropes or roving or weave them into a mat or the like. However, for the preparation of the composition according to this invention, it is convenient to use the glass fibers which have been cut into the form of strands having a length of about 0.3 3 cm, preferably less than about 0.6 cm. As for the flame retardant used in this invention, a group of compounds well known in the art as flame retarding material may be employed. Generally, there are used compounds containing flame retardancy imparting elements such as bromine, chlorine, antimony, phosphorus or nitrogen. Examples of such compounds are halogenated organic compounds, antimony oxide, combinations of antimony oxide and halogenated organic compounds, combinations of antimony oxide and phosphorus compounds, phosphorus compounds used singly or in combinations and compounds having phosphorus nitrogen bonds, or mixtures thereof. The amount of such flame retardant added in the composition is not critical, it may be added in any amount sufficient to impart the required flame retardancy. However, too much addition of such flame retardant should be avoided as it impairs the physical properties of the composition such as lowering the softening point. It is easy for those skilled in the art to determine the proper amount of such flame retardant to be added in the composition. Generally, it is suggested to blend said flame retardant in an amount of 0.5 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 25 parts, more preferably 3 15 parts by weight to 100 parts by weight of the mixture of a polyphenylene oxide resin and a rubber modified alkenyl aromatic resin. The halogen containing compounds useful as flame retardants in the composition of this invention are those of the following general formula wherein n is a number of 1 to 10, and R is selected from the group consisting of the radicals such as alkylene, alkylidene or alicyclic bonds such as methylene, ethylene, propylene, isopropylene, isopropylidene, butylene, isobutylene, amylene, cyclohexylene, cyclopentylidene, etc. , ether, carbonyl, amine or sulfur containing bonds such as sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone , carbonate or phosphorus containing bonds. R may also represent a group comprising two or more alkylene or alkylidene bonds combined by a group such as amino, ether, ester, carbonyl, sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone or phosphorus containing bond. Ar and Ar are each a mono or polycarbocyclic aromatic group such as phenylene, biphenylene, terphenylene or naphthylene. Ar and Ar may be same or different from each other.

X is a monovalent hydrocarbon group, for example, an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, or decyl, an aryl group such as phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, xylyl or tolyl, an aralkyl group such as benzyl or ethylphenyl, a cyclic aliphatic group such as cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl, or a monovalent hydrocarbon group containing an inert substituent therein. When two or more X s are included, they may be same or different from each other. d ls an integer ranging from 1 to a maximal value equal to the greatest possible number of the substitutable hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring comprising Ar or Ar , and e is an integer ranging from 0 to a maximal value which is decided by the number of the substitutable hydrogen atoms on R. a, b and c are each an integer including 0. When b is not 0, neither a nor c is 0, or otherwise one of a and c may be 0. When b is 0, the aromatic groups are bonded to each other by a direct carbon carbon bond. The hydroxyl groups or substituents Y on the aromatic groups Ar and Ar may freely take their ortho , meta or para position on the aromatic ring. Listed below are examples of the halogen containing compounds represented by the above shown formula Typical of the preferred phosphorus compounds for use in this invention are those having the following general formula. wherein Q s may be same or different and each represents a hydrocarbon group such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkyl substituted aryl or aryl substituted alkyl, a halogen, hydrogen or a combination thereof.

Among them, triphenyl phosphate is most preferred. It is also desirable to use triphenyl phosphate in combination with hexabromobenzene or antimony oxide. Among other flame retardant additives usable in this invention are the compounds having phosphorus nitrogen bonds such as phosphorus nitride chloride, phosphoric ester amide, phosphoric acid amide, phosphonic acid amide, tris aziridinyl phosphine oxide and tetrakis oxymethyl phosphonium chloride. The present invention is further described below by way of Examples. Poly 2,6 dimethyl 1,4 phenylene oxide η 0.55 as measured at 25 C in CHCl₃ obtained from oxidative polycondensation of 2,6 xylenol and an ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer BONDFAST E by Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd. were mixed in the ratios shown in Table 1 by using an extruder double screw extruder Model PCM 30 by Toshiba Machinery . Mixing temperature approx. 280 C . The obtained pellets were compression molded to form the Izod impact test pieces and their impact value was measured. By way of comparison, there were similarly formed the Izod impact test pieces by using a low density polyethylene SUMIKATHENE F 101 1 produced by Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd. instead of the ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer, and their impact value was similarly measured. As is apparent from Table 1, the compositions of the Comparative Example comprising polyphenylene oxide and polyethylene are low in impact strength whereas the compositions of this invention comprising polyphenylene oxide and an ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer show a strikingly high impact strength, indicating good compatibility of polyphenylene oxide with the ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer. Polyphenylene oxide used in Example 1, an impact resistant polystyrene IESBRITE 500 A produced by Nippon Polystyrene Co., Ltd. and the ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer used in Example 1 were melted and mixed by an extruder. Test pieces were formed in the same way as in Example 1, and their impact strength was measured. The mixing ratios of the respective resin materials and the results of measurement of impact strength are shown in Table 2. As a comparative example, the same composition as above without the ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer was used. The result obtained is shown in Table 2. As is seen from Table 2, blending of only a small quantity of an ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer in the compositions consisting of polyphenylene oxide and rubber modified polystyrene results in a significant improvement of the impact strength. 40 Parts by weight of polyphenylene oxide used in Example 1, 50 parts by weight of impact resistant polystyrene COSDEN 945 produced by Cosden Oil Co. and 10 parts by weight of ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymers with different ethylene glycidyl methacrylate ratios were melt blended and formed into test pieces in the same manner as in Example 1, and their impact strength was measured. The results are shown in Table 3. 26 Parts by weight of EPDM rubber ESPRENE 301 produced by Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd. and 520 parts by weight of 2,6 xylenol were dissolved in 3,350 parts by weight of xylene, and then 12.6 parts by weight of manganese chloride, 838 parts by weight of methanol and 91.7 parts by weight of ethanolamine were fed thereinto and the mixed materials were polymerized at 30 C for 5 hours by blowing oxygen into the mixture to obtain an EPDM modified polyphenylene oxide. By using the thus obtained EPDM modified polyphenylene oxide, a composition was prepared according to the following recipe. Test pieces obtained by injection molding of the above composition had an Izod impact strength of 31.3 kg cm cm². A test specimen was prepared in the same manner as in Example 3, using however an ethylene glycidyl methacrylate vinyl acetate copolymer the mixing ratio by weight of the components being approx. 82 12 6 instead of the ethylene glycidyl methacrylate copolymer. The impact strength of this specimen was 28.3 kg cm cm².
