## Description
Composition for Reinforcing Asphaltic Roads and Reinforced Roads Using the Same Background of the Invention 1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to reinforcing roadways with a prefabricated reinforcing composite, and primarily to reinforcing asphaltic conrete overlays on Portland concrete or other underlying pavements to prevent cracks and other defects, which had previously appeared in the underlying pavement, from reappearing in the overlay.Thermal expansion or contraction is the primary cause of such cracks in the underlayment reappearing in the overlay. This phenomena is generally referred to as reflective cracks. The prefabricated reinforcing composite is a resin impregnated, semi rigia, open grid of continuous fiberglass filaments. The crosswise and lengthwise intersections of the grid are stitched together or otherwise fixedly connected. In use, the underlying pavement is coated with an asphaltic tack coat the semi rigid, open grid of this invention is then unrolled over the tack coat and an asphaltic mixture overlay is applied. Composites of asphaltic materials and fiberglass have shown superior resistance to reflective cracking and other defects.2. Description of the Prior ArtVarious methods and composites for reinforcing asphaltic roads and overlays have been proposed. U.S. Patent No 2,115,667 of Ellis 1937 refers to the use of flexible, woven, tape like strips or ribbons of fiberglass, 1 2 to 1 wide, which are interwoven at right angles to produce a netting with openings ranging from one to three inches square. These interwoven, flexible tapes are laid on a bed of asphalt and tied together at their intersections by means of wire staples. Another layer of molten asphalt is laid on top of the tapes, followed by crushed stone and a top coat of asphalt. The art has also used narrow strips 4 to 44 inches wide of a loosely woven fabric made of flexible fiberglass roving weighing 24 ounces per square yard in the repair of cracks in pavement.These are not impregnated with resin, and do not have grid like openings. They are laid down on top of a tack coat, followed by application of asphaltic concrete, but they are too expensive and too flexible to be practical t lay over substantial portions of a roadway and, because of their flexibility, like the unimpregnated structures ofEllis, would be difficult to handle if installed over substantial portions of a road where they could be subjected to traffic from paving vehicles and personnel as the overlayment is put down. Also the lack of adhesion between underlayment and overlying layers is a problem because of the essentially closed nature of the fabric.Also in the prior art are rigid plastic grids, such as shown in U.S. Patent flo. 4,168,924. These have the disadvantage that they cannot be continuously unrolled and are therefore difficult to install, and while they may use fiberglass as a filler for the plastic, they do not have the strength and other desirable characteristics of continuous filament fiberglass strands. Summary of the Present InventionIn making, maintaining and repairing paved roads and surfaces, particularly when placing an asphaltic concrete overlayment on top of an older pavement which has cracked, a tack coat of emulsified asphalt, liquid asphalt, or hot asphalt may be applied to bind the underlying layer of pavement, which may or may not be asphalt based, to a layer of asphalt mixture pavement. An asphaltic mixture, typically consisting of hot mix, or hot laid asphaltic concrete may then be laid down continuously using paving equipment designed fcr the purpose.In this invention a prefabricated resin impregnated, semi rigid, open grid of continuous filament fiberglass strands is placed on top of the tack coat and thereafter buried and imbedded in the roadway under the asphaltic concrete overlayment. Incidentally, the words roads and surfaces are used here in a broad sense to include sidewalls, driveways, parking lots and other such paved surfaces.The grid is formed of continuous filament rovings of fiberglass. We prefer ECR or z glass rovings of 2200 tex, though one could easily use weights ranging from about 1000 to about 5000 tex. These rovings are formed into grids with rectangular or square openings, preferably ranging in size from 3 4 to 1 on a side, though grids ranging from 1 8 to six inches on a side may be used.The grids are preferably stitched at the intersections of the crosswise and lengthwise strands to hold the grid shape, prevent the rovings from spreading out unduly, and to preserve the openings, which are believed to be important in permitting the overlayment to bind to the underlying layer and thereby increase the strength of the composite. At the same time, it makes possible the use of less glass per square yard and therefore a more econonical product for example, we prefer to use a grid of about 8 ounces per square yard, though 4 to 18 ounces per square may be used, but sone prior art fabrics had fabric contents of about 24 ounces of glass per square yard.While we prefer stitching these intersections together on warp knit, weft insertion knitting equipment using 70 to 150 denier polyester, other methods of forming grids with fixedly connected intersections may be utilized. For example, a non woven grid nade with thermosetting or therno plastic adhesive may provide a suitable grid.Once the grid is formed, an asphaltic coating or resin is applied to impart a semi rigid nature to it. This coating also makes the grid conpatible with asphalt and protects the glass from corrosion by water and other elements in the roadway environment. In drying, the rovings may be flattened, but the grid like openings are maintained. For example, in a preferred embodiment using 2200 tex rovings, a rectangular grid was formed, with openings of about 3 4 inch by one inch, and the rovings flattened to about 1 16 inch to 1 8 across. The thickness of the rovings after coating and drying was about 1 32 or less. thany resins can be used for this purpose, such as asphalt, rubber nodified asphalt, unsaturated polyesters, vinyl ester, epoxy, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, polyolefines, and phenolics which give the required rigidity, conpatibility, and corrosion resistance. They may be applied using hot melt, emulsion, solvent, or radiation cure systems. One curing system used for a coating and found satisfactory was thermally cured.For example, a 508 solution of 120 195eC boiling point asphalt was dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent using a series of padding rollers. The material was thermally cured at 1750C and a throughput speed of 30 yds. min. The pick up of asphalt material was 10 15E based on original glass weight.The grid wllen coated is semi rigid and can be rolled up on a core for easy transport as a prefabricated continuous component to the place of installation, where it is rolled out continuously for rapid, economical, and simple incorporation into the roadway. For example, it can be placed on rolls 15 feet wide containing a single piece 100 yards or more long, which makes it practical to use this grid on all or substantially all of the pavement surface, which is cost effective because it reduces labor costs. Where cracks occur in random fashion, mechanized laying of narrow strips of fabric is impossible, and it is costly to place narrow strips over each crack by hand. The above described reinforcement invention can be rolled out on a roadway which has previously been coated with tack coat. Once laid down it is sufficiently stable, prior to placing the overlayment on it, for vehicles and personnel to drive or walk on it without displacing it. The large grid openings permit the asphalt mixture to encapsulate each strand of yarn or roving completely and permit conplete and substantial contact between underlying and overlaid layers. The product has a high modulus and a high strength to cost ratio, its coefficient of expansion approximates that of road construction materials, and it resists corrosion by materials used in road construction and found in the road environment, such as road salt.
