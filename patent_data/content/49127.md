# Patterning process and process for production of electronic devices utilizing said patterning process.

## Abstract
A patterning process is provided wherein a material to be etched is coated with a ladder type organosiloxane resin, the coated resin is irradiated with energy rays according to a desi red pattern, the irradiated resin is subjected to a development treatment, and then, the material is etched by using the resin left after the development as a mask. The ladder type organosi loxane resin used is represented by the formula I
