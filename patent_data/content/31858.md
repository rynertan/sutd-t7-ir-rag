# An automatic trap for catching cockroach.

## Abstract
An automatic trap for catching cockroach mainly includes an automatic control mechanism. As cockroaches enter into the trap, they will inevitably touch a switch 28 of said auto matic control mechanism 10 to drive a slipping plate 24 forward and further to automatically sweep these cock roaches into a confinement cell 36 . After that, the slipping plate 24 will be also automatically back to its original posi tion, restoring the control function of the automatic control mechanism, which is the particularly advantageous feature of the invention.

## Description
AN AUTOMATIC TRAP FOR CATCHING COCKROACH The invention relates to an autornatic trap for catching cockroach and, more particularly, to an automatic trap for catching cockroach witty novel and simple construction, having an automatic control mechanism.Heretofore, with reference to the method of killing or catching cockroaches, people are almost by spreading aerosol insecticide directly on the body of cockroaches or over the places at where cockroaches usually appear. Consequently, carcasses of cockroaches a ways spread over the floor making our living circumstance so dirty. Especially, most of cockroaches like to live o hide in place of crack or darkness, so make us ore uneasy to clean out the carcasses.Therefore, the primary object of the invention is to overcome those inconveniences to people and to provide an automatic trap for catching cockroach having novel and simple construction which certainly has an improved effect.Another object of the invention is to disclose an automatic trap for catching cockroach which includes an automatic control mechanism. As cockroaches enter into the trap, they will inevitably touch a switch of said automatic control mechanism to drive a slipping plate forward and further to automatically sweep these cockroaches into a confinement cell. After that, the slipping plate will be also automa tically back to its original position, restoring the control function of the automatic control mechanism, which is the particularly advantageous feature of the invention.A further object of the invei0iion is to provide an automatic trap for catching cockroach, which has the advantage of automatic control operation with completeness.One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate only one specific embodiment, in which Figure 1 is a partia ly perspective view of an automa tic trap for catching cockroach according to the inven zion. Figure 2 is a view of the invention, including a perspective view while the slipping plate is moving on the rail and a view showing relative position between the slipping plates and the electric current reversing switch. Figure 3 is a partial plane view of the inner side of the trapping house. Figure 4 is a plane view of the transmission mechanism on the upper part of the invention. Figure 5 is a view showing relative position between the first clutching pully and the second clutching pully. Figure 6 is a view showing the closing and opening of the turning plate.Referring Figure 1, the automatic trap for catching cockroach according to the present invention is mainly divided into two parts, including the upper part, as trapping mechanism 10, and the lower part, as transmission mechanism 12.The trapping mechanism 12 is comprised of a trapping house 14 which is designed as a centrally spaced casing opened at its rear side and provided respectively with an entrance 16 at two lateral sides of its front end, so cockroaches may enter into the trapping house from an one of two sloped passage 18 also provided on both sides of the front end of the trapping house 14. The sloped passage 18 is provided with a lot of holes 18a within which tasted materials, such as suger, may be put for luring cockroaches.Specially now referring Figure 3, in the central part of the trapping house 14, a sectional U siiaped rail 20 is transversely set on, both sides of which are respectively provided with a slender slot 22 for the horizontal shift of the connector 26 which connects to and between two slipping plates 24 and inlays into said two slots 22 of the rail 20.Furthermore, the inner wall of the trapping house 14 near said entrance 16 is equipped with a pedal switch 28 constituted by multiple small metal plates, which is used for switching on the motor 30 ofthe transmission mechanism 12 have the slipping plate 24 moved forward. with referrence to the transmission mechanism 12 and the mechanism of the slipping plate 24, there will have more detailed description hereinafter. The rear opening of said trapping house 14 is provided with a closed room 32, like a tiirough, which is partitioned, and connectable, with the trapping house 14 by a turning plate 34 capable of opening or closing respectively in one direction.As shown in Figure 4, the transmission mechanism 12 performs by means of a motor 30 trough a transmission gear set 38 to drive the first clutching pully 40 and the second clutching pully 42 rotating in counter direction to each other. The driveii pully 40a of tile first clutching pully 40 is winded round by a steel wire 44 connected its another end to the front end of said connector 26 which is provided between two slipping plates 24.Further to refer Figure 4 5, the driven pully 42a of the second clutching pully 42 is also winded round by a steel wire 46 connected its another end to a ring 48 set on the driven pully 40a of the first clutching pully 140. Therefore, when the motor 30 runs in clock directioll, the driving pully 40b of the first clutching pully 40 will engage with its counterpart, the driven pully 40a, to rotate along arrow A direction and the steel wire 44 be rolled up to retract the slipping plate 214 along arrow C direction slipping back to its original position as appeared in Figure 2.However, due to the fa t that the driven pulles 42a doesn t engage with the driven pully 42b in face to face, the driven pully 42a will run idle without any bad influence 011 the normal operation of the first clutching pully 40. And when the mortor 30 runs in counterclockwise direction, the driving pully 42b of the second clutching pully 42 will engage with its counterpart, the driveii pul ly 42a, to rotate along arrow 73 direction, the result of which will roll up the steel wire 46 to retract tlie driven pully 40a of the first clutching pully 40 from the engaging position with the driving pully 40b so as to have tiie driven pully 40a run idle At this moment, because tlie tensive force resulted from the steel wire 44 on the front end of the slipping plate 24 disappears, the slipping plates will quickly move forward under the function of the tension spring 48 provided on the rear end of the connector 26. As soon as the extenden portion 50 which is also provided on the rear end of the connector 26 touches the turning button 54 of the electric current revensing switch 52 provided on the upper side of rear end of the trapping house 14, the turning button 54 will be turned to position 1 of its scale to change the electric current direction of coil of the motor 30.Upon changing direction of said electric current to have the motor 30 run in clock direction, the driven pully 42a of the second clutching pully 42 will become running idle as above described, and the driven pully 40a of the first clutching pully will again engage with the driving pully under the function of restitutive force of a spring 56 and rotate together to roll up the steel wire 44 to retract the slipping plate 214 back to its original position.Also, said tuning button 54 of the electric current reversing switch 52 is provided with a connecting wire 60 which is connected to the connector 26 provided between two slipping plates 24, so while the slipping plates 24 back to its original position, the turning button 54 will be turned to position 2 of its scale, due to the connecting wire 60 being pull straight. At this time, the electric current of motor s coil will change its direction again. Therefore1 if any clockroaches enter into the trapping house 14 and touch the pedal switch 28, the motor 30 will be switched on to run in counterclockwise direction and the slipping plate 24 will immediately slip forward to send these clockroaches to the rear end of the trapping house 14. the slipping plates 24 will further bump away the turning plate 314, capable of opening or closing in one direction, provided at the rear end of the trapping house 14, under the impulsive force of the slipping plate 24 to sweep these clockroaches into a confinement cell 36.In such a performing, the trap will again restore its function for trapping cockroaches. Therefore, the trap may repeat its operating cycle all over again and catch lots of cockroaches by automatic operation in continuty.
