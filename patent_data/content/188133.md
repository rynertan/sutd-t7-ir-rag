# A leaf spring clamp assembly.

## Abstract
An improved axle clamp is provided, particularly for use with composite material leaf springs, to securely fix the position of the leaf spring relative to a wheel axle or other suspension system member, such as in the suspension system of a motor vehicle. The axle clamp comprises a rigid clamp base 10 , a resilient wedge insert 12 , a rigid clamp plate 22 , and a resilient cover pad 23 . The clamp base 10 provides a bottom wall 11 and substantially parallel side walls 12A,12B extending from the bottom wall 11 to form a channel adapted to receive the wedge insert. The inner surface of at least one side wall of the clamp base 10 flairs from both ends into a channel widening convacity 14A,14B , preferably at the longitudinal mid point of the channel. The wedge insert 13 has a bottom wall 16 and substantially parallel side walls 17A,17B , extending from the bottom wall 16 and forming therewith an inner channel adapted to laterally jacket a leaf spring. The outer surface of the wedge insert 13 substantially fills the clamp base channel and, so, provides a convexity 18A,18B adapted to register with the channel widening concavity 14A,14B of the clamp base 10 . The clamp plate 22 attaches to the clamp base 10 to clamp the leaf spring 9 between them. The resilient cover pad 23 lies between the clamp plate 22 and the leaf spring. The cover pad 23 and the wedge insert 13 each provides a vertically raised support pad extending laterally across the channel at each end to contact and support the leaf spring 9 . The resilient material is recessed betwen the support pads to form a cavity adapted to receive vertical displace ment of the leaf spring 9 within the axle clamp upon flexure of the leaf spring.
