# Device for detecting the level of a liquid contained in a tank.

## Abstract
A container 12 with openings 17, 18 in the bottom is inserted in a fuel tank 13 and houses a flat, vertical bar 20 , up and down which a float 30 moves in accordance with the level of liquid 14 in the tank. One surface of the flat bar carries a vertical printed circuit track 27 . The opposite face of the bar carries an elongated resistive track. The tracks are bridged by a metal element 32 on the float 30 with wipers contacting the tracks. The resistance between the top of the resistive track and the conductive track 27 is inversely proportional to the liquid level. A third wiper contacts an off set portion 29 of another conductive track 28 to indicate when the fuel has reached a low level.
