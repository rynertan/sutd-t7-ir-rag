# Apparatus and method for spreading wires in a cable and connecting the wires to terminals.

## Abstract
Wire insertion apparatus 64, 142, 144 for inserting wires in a flat cable 4, 133 into cavities 34, 136 of an electrical connector 18, 20, 134 comprises a connector jig 64, 146 and a wire locating jig adjacent to the connector jig. The wire locating jig 72, 72 , 152 comprises a stack of side by side cable spreading and wire locating fingers 72, 72 , 152 . The cable 4, 133 , having its wires on closely spaced centers, is located adjacent to the connector and the stack of fingers 72, 72 , 153 is moved relatively towards the cable 4, 133 . The free ends 84 of the fingers move relatively between the wires of the cable and spread the wires until they are in alignment with the cavities 34, 136 in the connector 18, 20, 134 . Thereafter, the wires can be pushed into the cavities and inserted into slots 38 in the terminals 36 in the connector.
