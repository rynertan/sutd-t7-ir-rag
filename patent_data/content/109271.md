# HIGH VOLTAGE SWITCH HAVING INTERCHANGEABLE CONTACT SUPPORTS AND CONTACT BLADES FOR USE THEREIN

## Abstract
A high voltage multi position type three phase electrical switch having stationary and movable contacts which are sup ported, respectively, on relatively fixed and movable contact supports internally of a switch casing. The contact supports are interchangeable and are made of a nonconductive molded plastic. The contact supports are adapted to selectively sup port either conductive contact support bars on which relatively stationary spring contacts are mounted, or contact blades which, in association with movement of a movable contact support, may be closed into spring contacts carried on an as sociated relatively fixed contact support. The movable contact blades comprise flexible braided electrical conductors having conductive contact sleeves swaged on their opposite ends so that the contact end portions define contact bars which are substantially solid in transverse cross section. In a two posi tion embodiment, the contact bar ends of each contact blade are adapted, respectively,for fixed connection to the bushing connectors of service entrance terminals and for movement into closed circuit with corresponding spring contacts moun ted on the fixed contact support. In a three position embodi ment, a third molded contact support is fixed within the casing and has similar contacts associated therewith to enable closed circuit connection of alternative service entrance terminals.
