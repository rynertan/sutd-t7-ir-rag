## Description
SHUTTLE VECTORThe present invention relates to novel plasmids capable of autonomous replication in microorganisms belonging to different genera. Such multiply replicable plasmids are known as shuttle vectors.Recombinant DNA techniques allow the controlled introduction of genes in to a microbial system and their expression, which may result in useful overproduction of some metabolites. More specifically, a vector for example, a plasmid or a bacteriophage is an important requirement for introducing controlled genetic information in to a microorganism using genetic engineering.The present invention particularly relates to vectors for use in coryneform bacteria that is, bacteria of the genera Brevibaclerium and Corynebacterium . Coryneform bacteria are the main industrial producers of amino acids. The development of a vector able to replicate in the coryneform system allows the cloning of a gene capable of directing the synthesis of enzymes related to the biosynthesis of amino acids. GB2076853 is concerned with a coryneform bacterium for production of L glutamic acid. A DNA fragment from anL glutamic acid producing coryneform bacterium is used to generate a hybrid plnRmid for insertion in to a coryneform bacterium.FR2482622 describes production of L lysine using an engineered coryneform bacterium in which a DNA is inserted which controls resistance toS 2 aminoethyl cysteine and production of L lysine.EP63764 discloses transformation of microorganisms belonging to the genera Corvnebacterium andBrevibacterium by incubating protoplasts of a microbial strain belonging to one of the genera and a donor deoxyribonucleic acid in the presence polyethyleneglycol or polyvinylalcohol and at least one divalent metal cation to introduce said deoxyribonucleic acid into the protoplasts, regenerating the protoplasts by culturing in a hypertonic nutrient medium and thereafter recovering a transformed strain having a phenotype derived from the donor deoxyribonucleic acid.EP66129 is directed to the production of L threonine using an engineered Corynebacteria or Brevibacteria in which a fragment of chromosomal DNA derived from aDNA donor resistant to a amino ss hydroxyvaleric acid is inserted. EP71023 is similarly concerned with the production ofL isoleucine using an engineered coryneform organism in which has been inserted a fragment of chromosomal DNA derived from a DNA donor resistant to a amino t3 hydroxyvaleric acid.EP77548 is concerned with plasmids from Corynebacteria or Brevibacteria, particularly plasmid pAM330 obtained from ATCC 13869 and pAM286 from FERM P5485. Such plasmids are also disclosed in some of the earlier specifications mentioned above. EP77548 describes insertion of coryneform chromosomal DNA in to the plasmids to enhance production of L glutamic acid.EP82485 is principally concerned with recombinant DNA vector plasmids which express a product in Corynebacteria or Brevibacteria. The plasmid is a recombinant of a DNA fragment containing a gene expressible in a microorganism belonging to the genus Corynebacterium or Brevibacterium and a plasmid autonomously replicable in a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium or Brevibacterium. The recombinant is autonomously replicable in a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium or Brevibacterium and is detectable by the expression of the introduced gene. EP88166 is generally directed to cultivation methods based on insertion of a a gene in to the DNA ofCorynebacteria or Brevibacteria. A host microorganism selected from microorganisms belonging to the genusCorynebacterium or Brevibacterium is transformed with a recombinant DNA containing DNA foreign to the host microorganism.In general, the above patent literature suggests the possibility of genetically engineering coryneform bacteria to modify their industrially useful attributes. The DNA of these engineered bacteria is however principally obtained from Corynebacteria orBrevibacteria, and the resultant bacteria themselves are Corynebacteria or Brevibacteria. Hence development work is confined to these species.In accordance with this invention there is provided a plasmid capable of autonomous replication in microorganisms belonging to the genus Corynebacteriunt or the genus Brevibacterium and also in of the speciesBacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli.The provision of a plasmid vector which can autonomously replicate in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli allows study in these familiar species as well as use in coryneform bacteria. The plasmid can usefully contain a selectable marker such as antibiotic resistance, as well as an origin of replication for coryneform bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. The plasmids of this invention can also usefully. include at least one uniquely cleavable restriction site for introduction of foreignDNA sequences. Such sites then allow engineering of developed forms in which the vector further contains aDNA sequence relevant to the production of a metabolite such as an amino acid.The shuttle vectors of this invention can readily be constructed from available DNA sequences imparting the desired functions. Such available sequences can be plasmidal or chromosomal DNA. The typical plasmid of this invention, designated pFJl, has been constructed from three plasmid sources by conventional gene splicing techniques.The typical plasmid pFJl is able to replicate and express a marker, tetracycline resistance, in coryneform bacteria1 being a useful vector for them. It is also functional in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis which allows the study of the genes inserted in the vector in the two better known systems of gram negative and gram positive bacteria, respectively. This typical vector has been obtained by inserting a natural cryptic plasmid from Brevibacterium lactofermentum pBLl into a vector of Escherichia coli pBR325 to give a hybrid molecule in to which has been added a Bacillus subtilis vector pBCl6.l carrying a tetracycline resistance marker. The resulting molecule pFJl is able to transform and express tetracycline resistance in the three systems.The plasmid, pBLl 4.4 kilobases was found in the strain Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869, and is probably the same as plasmid pAM330 described in GB2076853. The plasmid pBLl has the disadvantage of not conferring any detectable phenotypic characteristic to the strain. Another larger plasmid pBL2 was also found in the ATCC 13869 strain. A restriction map for the plasmid pBLl is included in the accompanying drawing, in which The Figure is a scheme for construction of the plasmid pFJl.Plasmid pBR325 is an Escherichia coli vector described by F.Bolivar in Gene 4 121 1978 . It has tetracycline resistance. Like pBL1, the plasmid pBR325 has a single site for the restriction enzyme Hind III. Thus cleavage of both plasmids with Hind III and subsequent ligation readily gives a hybrid plasmid designated pPLl. insertion at the Hind III site of pBR325 inactivates its tetracycline resistance and hence clones containing hybrid molecules were easily detected. Plasmid pFrJl was found to be able to transform protoplasts of coryneform bacteria expressing chloramphenicol resistance.To make this plasmid pFLl functional in Bacillus subtilis, plasmid pBC16.1 Kreft, J. et al. Molec. Gen.Genet. 162 59 1978 and Tanaka, T. et al. J. Bacteriol.129 1487 197 can be employed. This plasmid is capable of conferring tetracycline resistance. Like plasmid pFLl, the plasmid pBC16.6 has a single site for the restriction enzyme EcoR I. Thus cleavage of both plasmids with EcoR I and subsequent ligation readily gives the plasmid designated pFJl. The resulting hybrid molecule was obtained by transformation of Escherichia coli competent cells, selecting for tetracycline resistance. This drug marker is expressed inEscherichia coli Kreft, J. et al. Molec. gen. Genet.162 59 1978 .The plasmid pFJl can then be introduced in to Bacillus subtilis and in Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium strains by conventional procedures, for example by treatment of protoplasts with polyethylene glycol PEG and selecting for transformants in regeneration media containing tetracycline. Plasmid pFJl is able to express ampicillin resistance inEscherichia coli and tetracycline resistance inEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium strains. Strains of Bacillus subtilis, Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869, andEscherichia coli K12 DHl carrying pFJ1 have been deposited at the National Collection of IndustrialBacteria under repective accession numbers NCIB 12020 3 october 1984 , 12021 3 october 1984 and 12023 19 october 1984 . The present invention is not however limited to the particular plasmid pF.31. Plasmids showing substantial homology preferably 70 , more preferably 80 homology with pFJl are easily constructed.More generally, alternative functionally equivalent DNA sequences can be substituted for those mentioned above.The present invention is illustrated by the following example when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing.EXAMPLE a Purification of plasmid pBLl from Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869.The publically available strain ATCC 13869 was used to inoculate a semisynthetic medium composition per liter glucose 20g, NH4 2S04 log, urea 3g, yeast extract lg, KH2 P04 ig, MgSO4 0.4mg. NaCl 50mg, FeS04 2pug, MnSO 2 vg, biotin 50 Bg and thiamine 200 ug, with medium pH adjusted to 7.3 , and grown at 30 C for 20 hours. 500 ml of the same medium were inoculated with 5 ml of the previous culture and incubated at 300C with shaking until the midlogaritmic phase of growth was reached.At this point Penicillin G was added at a final concentration of 0.3 U ml and incubation was continued at 300C for 90 minutes.Cells were recovered by centrifugation and washed withTE buffer Tris hydroxymethylaminomethane lOmM pH 8.0,EDTA lmM and frozen. Thawed cells were resuspended in 40ml of solution I glucose 50mM, Tris.HCl 25mM pH 8.0,EDTA lOmM pH 8.0, lysozyme lOmg ml and incubated at 370C for 60 minutes. Then 80 ml of solution II SDS 1 ,NaOH 0.2M were added and the mixture was incubated 5 minutes at 4 C cells lysed at this point. Then 40 ml of 3M potassium acetate pH 4.8 were added and the lysate was maintained at 4CC for 60 minutes. Centrifugation was carried out at 8000g for 30 minutes at 40C. To the supernatant 0.6 volumes of isopropanol were added, mixed and let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.Then the mixture was centrifuged at 8000g during 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet dried. The pellet was dissolved in 4.5 ml of TE buffer and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 with Tris base the final volume was adjusted to 8 ml. This solution was mixed with 8g of CsCl, 1 ml of 5 mg ml ethidium bromide and centrifuged at 40000 rpm for 40 hours at 250C in a Ti50 rotor.After density gradient centrifugation, bands of covalent closed circular DNA lower and linear DNA upper were distinguished by illumination with IV light. The lower band was collected from the side through a 21 gauge hypodermic needle with d syringe. Ethidium bromide was removed by extraction with isopropanol saturated with cesium chloride, and cesium chloride was eliminated by dialysis against TE buffer. In this way the plasmid DNA was obtained.The plasmid DNA was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. showing a plasmid designated pBL1 with a molecular weight of 4.4 Kb assessed by comparing its electrophoresis mobility with that of appropriate standard covalent closed circular DNA size markers.Another plasmid pEL2 of MW 60Kb was also found1 but it was not used in these studies. Plasmid pBLl was separated from pEL2 by low molecular weight agarose gel electrophoresis. b Cleavage sites of pBLl for several restriction endonucleases Plasmid pBLl was treated with various restriction endonucleases under suitable conditions. The samples were incubated and subjected to agarose 0.7 gel electrophoresis. After the electrophoresis the gel was strained with ethidium bromide and photographed under ultraviolet light. The restriction map of pBLl shown in figure 1 was constructed by double and or triple digestions. The restriction cleavage sites of pBL1 are also listed in the following table restriction enzyme cleavage sites BamH I o Bcl I 1 Bgl II 0 Hind III 1 Kpn I O Pvu II 0 Sph I 1 Xba I 1 c Construction of vector pFLlThe DNA of plasmids pBLl and pBR325 were digested with the restriction enzyme Hind III at their respective single restriction sites.The enzyme was inactivated by incubation at 650C for 15 minutes and the DNAs were ligated by T4 DNA ligase in the appropriate buffer for 18 hours at 120C.The mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli competent cells. Transformants were selected by plating on media containing chloramphenicol or ampicillin.Clones containing hybrid molecules were selected by their inability to grow on tetracycline replica plates, as the gene coding for this resistance in pBR325 was inactivated by insertion. Plasmid DNA was extracted from these clones. The molecular weight and restriction pattern were in agreement with the predicted parameters for a hybrid molecule. One of these clones was selected and the plasmid named pFLl. Digestion with several restriction enzymes showed that plasmid pFLl is a composite plasmid of pBR325 and pBLl combined at theirHind III sites, see the drawing.Plasmid pFrll was found to be able to transform protoplasts of coryneform bacteria expressing chloramphenicol resistance. d Construction of Vector pFJl To make this plasmid pFLl functional in Bacillus subtilis, plasmid pBC16.1 conferring tetracycline resistance Kreft, J. et al. Molec. gen. Genet. 162 59 1978 was isolated in a conventional manner Tanaka, T.et al. J. Backeriol. 129 1487 1977 , digested withEcoR I at its unique site and ligated by T4 DNA ligase in the appropriate buffer for 18 hours at 120C with pFLl linearized with the same EcoR I enzyme.The mixture was used to transform Escherichia coli competent cells. Transformants were selected on media containing ampicillin. Clones containing hybrid molecules were selected by their ability to grow on tetracyline and their inability to grow on chloroamphenicol replica plates it is known that the tetracycline resistance is expressed in Escherichia coli Kreft, J. et al. Molec. Gen. Genet. 162 59 1978 . One of these clones was selected and the plasmid named pFJl. Plasmid pFJl was purified. Digestion with several restriction enzymes showed that it is a composite plasmid of pFl and pBC16.1 with a molecular size of about 13 kilobases and the following cleavage sites for restriction endonucleases restriction enzyme cleavage sites BamH I 1 Bcl I 2 Bgl II o Eco RI 2 Hind III 2 Kpn I O Pst I 1 Pvu II 4 Sph I 2 Xba I 1The plasmid pFJl was shown to carry genes for resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin. e Shuttle characteristics of plasmid pFJlPlasmid pFJl was introduced by treatment of protoplasts with polyethylene glycol PEG in Bacillus subtilis and in Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium strains with selection of transformants in regeneration media containing tetracycline at 10 or 5 ug ml respectively. Plasmid pFJl is able to express ampicillin resistance inEscherichia coli and tetracycline resistance inEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Brevibacterium or Corynebacterium strains.
