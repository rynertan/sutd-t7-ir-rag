# PROGRAMMABLE BORDER COLOR FOR CRT OF COLOR TV

## Abstract
A central processing unit 10 loads a border register 36 with four color bits representing digital color signals to be used in determining the color of only the border area surrounding the video area of a cathode ray tube display screen 14 . A BORDER CONTROL TIME signal is generated at the appropriate times in the horizontal and vertical scan ning periods of the cathode ray tube to apply the digital color border signals R, G, B, I to a composite video signal generator 38 which generates the composite video signal for a TV set 14 or a TV monitor.
