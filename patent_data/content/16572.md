# Drive system of an ultracentrifuge operating in a vacuum environment.

## Abstract
A system of bypass passages 58, 60, 62 adjacent bearing means 20, 22, 24 in the drive system of an ultracentrifuge which operates in a vacuum environment. The bypass pas sages 58, 60, 62 or channels are designed to prevent the establishment of a pressure differential across the bearings 20, 22, 24 in the drive system when a vacuum is being pulled or exists around the drive system when it is operating. The unique bypass system prevents the loss of lubricating mater ial within the drive system during air evacuation of the drive system and the rotor chamber when a vacuum environment is being established within the rotor chamber. Also, the bypass system promotes a more uniform and constant flow of lub ricating medium in the bearings.
