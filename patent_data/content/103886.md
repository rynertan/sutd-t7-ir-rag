# Pipe laying apparatus.

## Abstract
A pipe laying apparatus having an excavator 4 for performing excavation in the earth 8 to form a substantially horizontal hole 10 , the excavator having connected to its trailing end a leading end of at least one underground pipe 14, 16 at least partially located in the horizontal hole, an injector 30 for injecting a viscosity imparting liquid into the earth in which excavation is being performed by the excavator to produce viscosity imparting liquid containing soil particles 32 , and a propelling device 20 positioned against a trailing end of the pipe and located in a starting pit 18 . The viscosity imparing liquid containiner soil particles produced by said excavator and injector are conveyed rearwardly of the excavator past an outer periphery thereof and filled in an annular gap 34 defined between the horizontal hole and the pipe while the excavator and pipe are advanced by the propelling device. A soil particles discharg ing device 52, 72 is located between the trailing end of the excavator and the leading end of the pipe and within the pipe for introducing into the pipe the viscosity imparting liquid containing soil particles conveyed rearwardly of the excava tor past the outer periphery thereof and discharging the soil particles into the starting pit through the pipe.
