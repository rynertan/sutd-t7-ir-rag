# Method of manufacturing a plug.

## Abstract
In accordance with the method, a supporting body 21 is formed by arranging contact members 3 so as to be adjacent and mutually parallel in a straight line and by moulding the contact members in a ribbon like, flexible plastics body 1 while leaving contact portions 5 free. Subsequently, the body is rolled up so as to form a cylinder which is mounted in a bush 19 in order to form the supporting body 21 . Prior to rolling up connection portions 7 of the contact member 3 are connected to conduc tors 9 of a cable 11 . Finally, the assembly thus formed is enclosed by a plug body 25 which leaves the contact portions 5 free.
