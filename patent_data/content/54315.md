# Pattern generator.

## Abstract
A pattern generator in which a workpiece 28 to be machined into a desired pattern shape is held in vacuum and is irradiated with a laser beam 24 condensed to be fine, whilst scanning the laser beam 24 so as to depict the desired pattern shape, whereby the workpiece 28 is directly machined in conformity with the desired pattern shape. As the workpiece 28 , one in which a shading film 29 for example, chromium film is deposited on a transparent glass substrate 30 is employed, and it is irradiated with the laser beam 24 in the vacuum, whereby the irradiated parts of the shading film 29 are vaporized to fabricate a shading mask pattern of good quality.
