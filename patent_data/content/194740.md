# Inflatable float assembly for aircraft.

## Abstract
Inflatable or pneumatic float assembly 10 has tough outer fabric tubular shell with an upper wall 18 having a first elongated sleeve 41 extending therealong to receive an elongated stiffening member 48 . A lower wall 19 of the float is stiffened by stiffenars to provide a step 35 having an essentially upright transversely extending step wall 61 . The float has a plurality of internal baffles which form inflatable compartments within the float, preferably to receive air filled bladders. The elongated stiffening member 48 extending through the first sleeve 41 has exposed portions to provide access 52 for attachment means 54 which cooperate with the exposed portions to permit the stiffening member to cooperate with an aircraft undercarriage. Wheels can be provided to permit the aircraft to be amphibious for landing on and as well as water, with various structures to permit changing relative positions of the wheels and the floats. Air pressure within the floats is such that the float provides a resilient suspension to provide a smoother ride when moving on choppy water or to resiliently mount the wheels in one wheeled embodiment.
