## Description
This invention provides an apparatus or installation for the manufacture of a compound panel comprising a metal framework with a lightweight core, suitable for use in building construction. The metal framework of the panel is a three dimensional wire grill or grating, normally in the form of two parallel meshes joined together by a series of wires welded to them, hereinafter referred to as connectors. The lightweight core may be a layer of foam resin or dense box material, fibre or plastics, with reinforcing walls which will allow a segment of wire easily to pass through it. These panels can be building elements used in the construction as walls or flooring and then coated with resistant mortar on both sides the panels can easily be joined to one another on the building site by conventional means. Known panels of this type are described in US A 3555131 and are made with very fine wire 2 mm gauge, and mesh opening of 50 mm and were manufactured according to the following process The panels were constructed in standard sizes 5 m 1.20 m, for example, making it necessary later to cut them on the job, with the consequential losses and expense. Production according to the method described in the U.S. patent is known to have taken place in large sheds or buildings of an area of more than 500 m² which demanded costly investment and full time personnel. In FR A 2177030 which corresponds to US A 3838241 a fundamentally different approach to panel making is disclosed from that of the present invention. In the French patent a wire matrix is formed first and then the core is formed within the matrix, whereas in the present invention the core is provided first and the wire matrix is then formed around it. The apparatus of the French patent therefore suffers from an inherent inflexibility of operation which does not afflict the apparatus of the present invention. According to the invention there is provided an apparatus for the manufacture by a continuous process of compound panels for building construction, said panels being of variable cross section and of any desired shape and comprising a metallic framework and a lightweight core, the metallic framework consisting of a three dimensional wire grille or grating generally presented in the form of two parallel meshes joined by a series of connector wires welded to them, said connector wires being inclined with respect to the wires of the meshes, the lightweight core consisting of a layer of foam resin or dense box material, paperboard laminate, fiber or plastics material, provided with reinforcing walls and unresistant to a wire segment passing through it, characterized in that it comprises In the first section of the installation, the manipulation of thousands of units of wire segments presents difficulties in the feeding of the machine, since any trouble or flaw could cause jamming. To avoid this, resort can be made to an alternative process somewhat similar to that used in stapling machines. First, a series of connector wires are joined back to back in the form of combs, and their teeth or prongs are gummed with a lacquer to hold them together on a plane. The machine is fed with packs of combs in a process much more orderly than handling loose wires. In addition, one load of wires can be sufficient for a full day s work by the machine so that there is no longer any need to continuously load the hoppers. The subsequent detachment of the wires from each comb, one by one for their insertion, is performed by a guillotine similar to that used in staplers, which places the wire in front of a gun fastener which thereupon drives it into the lightweight core. The connectors may also be joined to form a continuous and flexible comb roll, using an elastic bonding lacquer with an adhesive support backing. In such a case the connectors are fed from comb rolls suspended above the machine. The combs are made outside the machine in a continuous process employing a lacquer applicator, in infrared dryer and a cutter. In the second section of the installation, the welders grouped in columns advance and retract as the mesh passes, and it is fundamental that their electrodes always locate with a certain exactness, by pressure upon it, the cross formed by the end of the connector and the longitudinal wire of the mesh. To achieve this, in a development of the invention, a mechanism has been selected by means of which the mesh, during its advance inside the machine, is drawn over a smooth belt or idler rollers, propelled by a retractable hook which intermittently pulls against a vertical wire of the mesh. The system of fastening the meshes and the polystyrene sheet to a continuous conveyor belt or endless chain moved by constant impulses has been discarded. The advantage of the device adopted is that even though there are panels of imperfect size within a normal tolerance which differ slightly from the fixed advance rate of the machine adapted to a standard opening , there is no accumulation of defects or a maladjustment in the positioning of the said crosses facing the electrodes. Naturally, there is a hook on each side for each mesh, and two on each side make traction smoother and serve to overcome any possible snag of the mesh roll. A special embodiment of the installation is movable, and can be transported by truck to a job site. Another improvement is the provision of means for adhering, to one side of the lightweight core and prior to placement of the corresponding wire mesh, an aluminium or plastics sheet to serve as a vapour barrier. In the present invention the panels are made with larger mesh sections approximately 10 10 cms and with heavier wire from 2.5 mm and up than the known panels disclosed hereinbefore, thereby simplifying the process considerably, greatly reducing cost and introducing the innovation of manufacture of the panel in an endless sheet which can be cut to an exact size as it exits from the machine. Only one continuous machine is required for the entire process, and the installation can be carried easily by truck to the construction site as it occupies a space smaller than 25 m² . A basic factor in the feasibility of this new system of manufacture has been the renunciation of a great density of fine mesh, which was thought necessary to prevent the sprayed mortar from falling off however, experience has shown that there is fully satisfactory adherence with a 10 10 cms opening having one connector in each panel, with care in the spraying of the mortar which should be applied in two layers, one several hours after the other, and with scraping or scratching of the surface of the lightweight core to give it a rough surface. Another basic factor has been the extensive selection of any suitable lightweight foam or paperboard which can be used, provided it can hold the driven wires in the prior art system, it was first necessary to make the wire structure, then spray its interior with the foam resin core. It would be difficult to use the system described in this invention with the fine wire meshes previously used, since the great number of connectors and the reduced space for inserting the electrodes between the wires would greatly hinder the process. Increased wire gauge is a notable improvement offered by the system, since there is greater resistance to rust especially in storage at the building site , greater resistance to impacts during handling and greater rigidity of the panel during the process of assembly and concreting. Owing to their function, connectors must be protected against rust, for which reason their composition can be important inasmuch as in certain cases the process of manufacture of the panels requires preliminary preparation. If the connectors are of stainless steel, the process is the normal one previously explained, since stainless steel is weldable. But, if they are of galvanized iron, their ends must be denuded or pickled so that they can be welded. This is done by introducing the packs of connector combs by their teeth or prongs in an acid bath for several minutes at a depth of some 10 mm, following which they are washed in a neutral solution. If the surface of the connectors is plasticised or impregnated with already hardened resin, roll wire is used which is straightened and then cut into measured segments, some 10 mm of the ends being ground or sharpened in an automatic machine, thereby becoming weldable where they intersect the mesh wires. According to the process described, it is thus possible to manufacture panels of varying cross section or of many shapes, bending the two principal meshes as desired and adapting the length of the connectors to them, giving the lightweight core a foam conforming to the exterior surface of the meshes. Before describing the installation, the following should be noted which determines one aspect of the process. The panels are to be rectangular, the longer side coinciding with the perpendicular walls. The diameter of the connectors approximates that of the mesh wires, and said connectors are welded to the longitudinal wires of the panels. They are inclined with respect to said longitudinal wires of the panels, for the purpose of absorbing the shear stresses produced between the two hard layers of the concreted panel. In summary, the longitudinal wires of the panel those parallel to the major axis are welded obliquely to the connectors, and thus it is best that the panel be made lying on its side on a vertical plane, with its major axis horizontal . Another improved embodiment of the invention includes adjacent auxiliary machines for producing the mesh from plain wire and, in substitution of a roll of sheeting of lightweight material which could be used, provision is made for a likewise adjacent extruder of said lightweight material which automatically extrudes the sheeting from raw resin foam. The process of continuous feed of the lightweight core has been initially conceived on the basis of foam material such as polystyrene , continuously manufactured in an extension preceding the panel making machine. But it is possible that such material may not be profitable or usable for other reasons, making it necessary to consider continuous manufacture of the core from a paperboard base in an extension preceding the said machine. In one such extension, manufacture commences from three rolls of paperboard. The upper and lower outer surfaces of a continuous box like or walled rectangular tube paperboard material proceed from respective parallel rolls of paperboard. The heart or core between the two outer layers is a longitudinally crimped prismatic roll of crenellated or dentated cross section. Said crimped roll is obtained by means of a slitting mechanism and successive wheels which crease the paperboard to the eventual crenellated form, exerting pressure downward and laterally, which crimped roll is then glued or stapled to the upper and lower rolls to form said rigid boxlike material. The upper or lower outer layer of the boxlike material can have a slightly curved cross section, of special interest for manufacturing core as flooring. The paperboard must undergo previous or posterior treatment based on anti moisture resins, so that it is not affected by the mortar or concrete which will come in contact with it or by atmospheric humidity when the material is stacked on the job site, prior to use. To facilitate the fastening of the connector wires, their points are beveled or chamfered for easier passage through the paperboard. This is done by cutting packs of wires obliquely with the disk of a saw. Another improvement introduced is a panel feeding arrangement followed by a manual stapling or spot welding device, for joining the panels together to form the meshes. Also, an arrangement is provided for feeding panels of the said material, followed by a manual glueing or stapling device for joining the panels. Finally, the installation can be adapted to manufacture elements of varying core thickness, and to fasten connector wire segments of different lengths. To be able to introduce different thicknesses of lightweight core and thus vary the thickness of the panel, the structure of the installation must be slightly modified. The machine has a plane of symmetry coinciding with that of the panel during its manufacture. To make panels of different thickness the machine is divided along said plane, to either separate or bring together the two resulting halves. One of the halves remains fixed, while the other moves perpendicularly on wheels until blocked at the required distance. In the selection of the geometry of the panel, certain dimensions must be invariable so as not to excessively complicate the machine, within the required degrees of regulation. These fixed parameters can be Instead of these fixed parameters, others can be fixed without varying the essence of the machine. Of great important for regulating the width of the machine is a guide device which maintains the lightweight core and meshes at the proper distance during the manufacturing process. This is a double series of welded vertical and horizontal guide pins, which act as separators between mesh and core and which cover a zone from the column of welders to the entrance of the mesh, a distance of a minimum of three metres. Upon starting the machine, it is important to maintain the relative position of the connector fastening batteries and of the column of welders invariable with respect to the cited network of separator guide pins, which is on the same side. The connector magazines contain partitions which permit the housing of connectors of different lengths. The discharge needles are of maximum length and serve for all cases. As the points of incidence of the connectors in relation to the longitudinal wires of the meshes must always be repeat, must always be , the same distance from the neighbouring junction points so that the welders are always in front of an intersection of wires , it is necessary to vary the angle of insertion of the connectors with respect to the discharge needles , which will be of lesser inclination the greater the thickness of the panel. To widen the machine, first the movable half is unblocked and is moved parallel to itself to the desired width it is blocked once more, and immediately the angle of incidence of the connector fasteners is varied so that the connectors cross with the longitudinal wires of the meshes at the cited fixed points, and thus the electrodes of the welder tongs then perform their function without longitudinal movement, that is, they move only in perpendicular direction toward the surface of the meshes. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which The machine functions in the following manner The loader 3 2, represented particularly in Figs. 5 and 6, is fed from the hopper 3 4, the bottom of which contains two rollers 3 3 which turn in opposite directions and propel the connector wires one by one into the fastening device. From the fastening device 3, the unit of meshes In Figs. 16 and 17 only the welding column on one side of the machine has been represented, since the other column is identical. The upper electrodes 4 1 of the column are solid with a common vertical flange, and the lower electrodes 4 2 are solid with another parallel flange or are free and are operated pneumatically. In the open position, the column is made to advance pneumatically to the position shown in Fig. 17, where the electrodes approach and resistance weld, aided by compression, the pairs of wires, for example 2 1 and 2 2. If the installed power does not permit this for example, if the work is being done on the job site , the welding equipment could be modified by making cascade stippling, that is, simultaneously pressuring the wires in column but welding one after another. Following the welding operation, all that remains is the cutting of the panels to size. A saw The preceding description must be considered purely illustrative and in no way limitative, and any and all variations, substitutions of material, etc., may be included which fall within the scope of the following claims.
