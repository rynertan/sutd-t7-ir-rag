# Composite band for a footwear forming machine.

## Abstract
A composite band 1, 1A for use in a footwear forming machine. The composite band includes an elongated pad 6 formed to have a bight 6A portion and a pair of legs 6B, 6C extending outwardly from the bight portion 6A . A flexible elongated metal strip 7, 7A is secured at the outer surface of the elongated pad 6 . The composite band 1, 1A is sub jected to flexing forces whereby, in the footwear forming process, it is repeatedly bent to conform to the shape of the footwear and then relaxed to an unflexed condition. The metal strip 7, 7A contains three or more spaced loops 9A E , one at each leg 6B, 6C and one at the bight portion 6A to prevent undue stress during flexure. The loops 9A E serve also to permit inwardly directed forces to be applied to the composite band 1, 1A .
