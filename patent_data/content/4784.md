# Lead connector for a body implantable stimulator.

## Abstract
In a connector for interconnecting a furcated lead 10 and signal generator 16 to form a body implantable stimulator, the connector 17 is secured to the signal generator to form a signal generator assembly. Jacks 26, 30 are provided in the connector to receive the lead furculae while facilitating conformance of furculae to the configuration of the signal generator on wrapping of the furculae around the signal generator 16 . The jacks 26, 30 accept the furculae at different distances from the signal generator to allow a thinner signal generator assembly and at different depths to compensate for the difference in distance of the jacks 26, 30 from the signal generator 16 . In this way the hitherto encountered problem of fibrosis caused by the excess length of furculae is greatly reduced.
