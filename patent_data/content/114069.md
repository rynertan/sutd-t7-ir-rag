# Cryogenic refrigeration system with linear drive motors.

## Abstract
In a cryogenic split Stirling refrigerator, the compressor and displacer are driven by linear drive motors. Each compres sor linear drive motor has a plurality of radial permanent mag nets 44, 46 mounted to each compressor piston 22, 24. A tapered collet 56 expands an expanding sleeve 42 against the magnets and compresses a sleeve 38 against the piston. A housing 34 hermetically seals the gas about the armature and supports the coil assembly 76, 78. The displacer drive motor includes an axial permanent magnet 202 mounted to the dis placer drive piston 192. It is surrounded by a housing 210 which hermetically seals the spring volume surrounding the magnet. The drive coils 216, 218 are supported on that hous ing. The coils are surrounded by flux returns 222, 224 which can be adjusted to minimize radial forces on the drive piston.
