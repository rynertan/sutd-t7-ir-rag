# Metal diphthalocyanine electrochromic displays and electrolytes therefor.

## Abstract
The lifetime of a metal diphthalocyanine electrochrom ic display can be substantially extended by employing a predominantly non aqueous low hydroxyl ion electrolyte. A preferred electrolyte solvent is ethylene glycol and preferred conductivity salts are tetraethyl ammonium fluoride and sodium chloride. In the case of sodium chloride, conductivity is improved by the addition of up to 25 water to the electrolyte.
