# Improvements in or relating to pipework.

## Abstract
Apparatus is described for insertion into a branch pipe to cut an aperture in a liner provided within the main pipe for re pairing the latter. The apparatus has a body together with a cutting device and a clamping member e.g. an inflatable sleeve both supported by the body. Means are provided for actuating the clamping member so that it presses against the inside of the branch pipe and jams the body in a fixed position within the branch pipe. The cutting device may be advanced relative to the body, to cut an aperture in the liner. Also de scribed is an inflatable plug which may be used to provide a seal so that a grouting operation may be performed without grout being able to escape into the branch pipe or into the in terior of the liner.
