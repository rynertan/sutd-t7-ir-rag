# A MULTI MODE RADIO TRANSCEIVER

## Abstract
A multi mode radio transceiver comprising a sequence of bi directional circuit modules including a radio frequency in put output amplifier module 1 , a radio frequency baseband I and Q quadrature channel conversion module 2 an analogue digital conversion module 3 , a digital signal processor 4, 5 , and a digital signal input output interface 6 , with a control means 7 whereby for transmission a radio frequency signal is formed from analogue quadrature I and Q channel components of a digitised signal at baseband and translated to the radio tranmission frequency and for reception the radio frequency signals are transformed into I and Q quadrature analogue com ponents at baseband and subsequently digitised.
