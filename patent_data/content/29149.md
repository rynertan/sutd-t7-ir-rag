The storage bin may be cylindrical in shape, the feed delivery port being at the far end of a spiral or tangential chute 22 extending from the storage bin, the delivery mechanism comprising at least one rotat ably driven elongated thin flat flexible blade. The automatic feeding device may also provide a feed agitating means 50, 52 stirring the feed in the storage bin above the de livery mechanism.
