# Magnetic toner.

## Abstract
A magnetic toner employable as a developer for an electrophotographic duplication system, in which an elec trostatic latent image is developed on a carrier, a copying sheet is placed over said carrier of developed image, and the developed image is transferred to said sheet, contains magnetic fine particles of an electric resistivity from 10⁹ to 10¹⁶Ω.cm at 4000 V cm DC and a dielectric constant from 2.6 to 5.
