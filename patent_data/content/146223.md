# METAL POLISHING COMPOSITION AND PROCESS

## Abstract
Metal surfaces such as the working surfaces of nickel plated blanks for rigid memory discs are polished in a two stage process of rough and finish polishing by a combina tion of mechanial and chemical mechanisms. Each stage in volves a plurality of cycles in which the surface is polished using a rotating polishing pad with an aqueous suspension of aluminum oxide containing a lubricant surfactant and a chlorine containing oxidizing agent present at the surface pad interface followed by the addition of an aqueous colloi dal aluminum oxide sol to the oxidizng agent containing suspension at the intertace which frees the chlorine in the oxidizing agent to exert a chemical polishing action on the surface.
