# Electronic display apparatus.

## Abstract
Changeable visual electronic display apparatus comprises a liquid crystal display LCD which has a number of display electrode elements and which is connected to and controlled by a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS integrated circuit 1 . The CMOS circuit includes a programmable read only memory PROM 3 which contains a set of data instructions. In accordance with these instructions and under the direction of a controller 2, 6 14, 15 a selection of electrode elements receive data pulses, corresponding to stored instructions, and these elements change state to present a particular visual display. Subsequent sets of instructions are fed to different selections of electrodes and different, or the same, visual displays are produced. The frequency of change of the visual display is controlled by an osciliator 10 . A second PROM may be provided on the CMOS circuit with its output fed to a speech or a tone generator so that audio signals are produced in synchronism with the changing visual display. The integrated circuit and LCD are combined with a power source in one unit, which is preferably an article of jewellery.
