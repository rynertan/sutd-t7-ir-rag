# Method of and apparatus for continuously manufacturing slide fastener coupling elements.

## Abstract
In a method of and an apparatus for continuously manufacturing slide fastener coupling elements, a molded strip of coupling element blanks 20 is folded by a first folder unit 54 about its longitudinal axis while still hot into a U shaped cross section to provide a folded strip of coupling element blanks 60 each having a width W2 larger than a predetermined width W1 of each of the coupling elements 27 as ultimately shaped. After having been heated by a hot air blower 85 , the hot folded strip of blanks 60 is shaped by a second folder unit 67 into slide fastener coupling elements 27 of a finalized shape and dimensions through a plurality of bending stages in which the widths of the coupling element blanks 60 are constricted stepwise by the second folder unit 67 as the folded strip of blanks 60 is fed therethrough.
