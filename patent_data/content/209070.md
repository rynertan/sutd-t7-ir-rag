# HIGH FREQUENCY INTRA ARTERIAL CARDIAC SUPPORT SYSTEM

## Abstract
Disclosed is a high frequency intra arterial cardiac sup port system having a balloon pump 20 which may be posi tioned in a major artery downstream of a natural heart. The bal loon pump comprises a pumping balloon 14 , of small dis placement, mounted upon and cyclically inflatable and deflat able by fluid flow through catheter 16 having a lumen leading to the outside of the body. The balloon pump further com prises a valve 15 mounted downstream of said pumping bal loon. The system further comprises a control and drive mech anism 18 for providing cyclical fluid flow to said lumen of said catheter for inflation and deflation of said pumping balloon. The cyclical flow and the cyclical inflation and deflation occur at a frequency which is at least three times the normal beating fre quency of the natural heart. The small displacement of the pumping balloon is much smaller than the normal stroke vol ume of the natural heart.
