# Display method and apparatus employing cursor panning.

## Abstract
A graphics display device is provided with a graphical input device which cooperates with means for addressing the display device s bit map memory 58 so that a viewport 56 into the bit map memory 58 can be panned in conjunction with a cursor 70 controlled by the input device. In particular, if the input device is operated for moving the cursor within the viewport 56 displayed on a cathode ray tube screen until the edge of the viewport 56 is encountered, the addressing of the bit map memory 58 is changed whereby the whole viewport appears to be moved by the cursor 70 . Thus, if a transition is made in cursor movement from a location inside the viewport 56 to a location outside the viewport, the viewport is redefined such that the cursor 70 falls just within the viewport, as long as the dimensions of the virtual screen in the bit map memory are not exceeded.
