# Antenna arrangement.

## Abstract
An antenna arrangement is provided with a phase lock loop 13 so that the phase of microwave energy radiated by an antenna element 1 can be precisely controlled. The phase lock loop provides compensation for phase errors introduced in the feed to the antenna element and includes a controllable local oscillator 12 . In practice, a large number of individual antenna channels could be provided, each having its own phase lock loop, so that together a directional microwave beam would be radiated. Such a requirement can exist in connection with pulsed radars.
