## Description
PRODUCTION OF COATED RUBBER PLUG FOR CONTAINERS This invention relates to a rubber plug and a process for producing the same and, more particularly, an elastomeric rubber plug at least part of the surface of which has a coating of a polymer laminated thereon. A rubber plug for a container for medical user unlike rubber plugs for general use, must meet standard requirements specified by rules. Moreover, there is an exacting and growing demand for reliability of medical containers. To this demand, various kinds of rubber plugs having a fluoro polymer layer coated on their surface which is inserted into the container have been proposed and used. These coated plugs do not contaminate the medicament in the container since, in general, a fluoro polymer prevents rubber compounding ingredients from being dissolved out into the medicament, and the polymer is not itself dissolved out because of its extreme inertness and excellent chemical resistance. However, fluoro. polymers lack adhesion to and compatibility with a rubber, due to their inertness. Therefore, such coated rubber plugs have conventionally been produced by previously surface treating a fluoro polymer film or sheet prior to adhesion to a rubber plug. For example,Japanese Patent Publication No. 1355 77 discloses a process for producing a fluoro polymer laminated rubber plug for medical containers, which comprises molding a film of a fluoro polymer, one surface of which having been rendered adhesive by treatment with sodium naphthalene, into a plug shape, placing the plug in a mold of a prescribed shape in the manner such that its treated surface faces a piece of unvulcanized rubber, and heating the laminate under pressure.However, this process is not always industrially advantageous because such a surface treatment involves complicated procedures due to the use of metallic sodium. Further, there is a fear that some sodium may remain in the fluoro polymer film. It is well known to treat the surface of a Eluoro polymer film by corona discharge to render it adhesive.However, when thus treated film and an unvulcanized rubber sheet are laminated and shaped into a plug, the effect of the above adhesion treatment on the polymer is considerably reduced. In particular, adhesion in the stretched parts is substantially lost, and it is very difficult to adhere the film to a rubber even with an adhesive.Therefore, it is necessary to pre mpld the fluoro polymer film into a prescribed shape, which complicates the procedure and increases its cost. Japanese Patent Publication No. 53184 82 describes a process for producing a laminated elastomeric plug, which comprises laminating a film of a fluoro polymer and an unvulcanized rubber sheet in a mold and heating the laminate under pressure to shape it to a plug. By this process, however, adhesion between the fluoro polymer film and the rubber is not satisfactory because a fluoro polymer film is generally far inferior to rubber in moldability and also because the polymer film is stretched upon thus shaping into a plug. The published Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 5046 84 describes a process which comprises subjecting a fluoro copolymer film to a surface treatment such as corona discharge, glow discharge or arc discharge, to form a crosslinked thin film having a sputtering effect, laminating the treated resin film and an unvulcanized rubber sheet in a plug shaped mold, and heating the laminate under pressure to thereby shape the laminate to a plug simultaneously with vulcanization of the rubber.This process similarly involves partial stretching of the resin film upon shaping to a plug, and it is difficult, therefore, to obtain a laminated plug wherein there is excellent adhesion between the fluoro polymer film and the rubber. We have now found that a high quality plug can be produced easily and stably by heating a fluoro polymer film which has been previously subjected to sputter etching at a prescribed power together with an unvulcanized rubber in a mold under pressure to shape it into a plug. The resultant plug made of rubber with a surface coating of fluoro polymer exhibits excellent adhesion between the film of polymer and the rubber even in the stretched part of the film. The present invention thus provides a rubber plug, whereof at least the surface which is to be inserted in a container has laminated thereto a film of a fluoro polymer, the adhered film surface having been previously subjected to a sputter etching treatment under a discharge 2 power condition of from 0.1 to 20 Watt sec cm . Such a plug is prepared according to the invention by subjecting one surface of a film of a fluoro polymer to sputter etching under a discharge power condition of from 0.1 to 20 Watt sec cm2, laminating the film with an unvulcanized rubber sheet in the manner such that the treated surface of the film is in contact with the rubber sheet, heating the laminate in a mold under pressure to vulcanize the unvulcanized rubber and simultaneously shaping the laminate into a plug shape. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of an apparatus used for sputter etching Figure 2 is a cross sectional view of the laminate of a fluoro polymer film and an unvulcanized rubber sheet and a cavity for molding the laminate Figure 3 is a cross sectional view illustrating an example of a laminated rubber plug according to the present invention and Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of an other example of a plug according to the invention. The fluoro polymer film which can be used in the present invention can be a film of polytetrafluoroethylene, an ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, a tetrafluoroethylene perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer, a tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene copolymer, polyvinylidene fluoride, polychlorotrifluoroethylene. The polymer resin film generally has a thickness of from 15 to 500 urn, although varying depending on the purpose of use and the like. The rubber which can be used in the present invention includes natural rubber and various synthetic rubbers, such as butyl rubber, an ethylene propylene terpolymer, epichlorohydrin rubber, isoprene rubber, butadiene rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, urethane rubber, etc. In the process of the invention,. the fluoro polymer film is subjected to sputter etching so as to impart the adhesion to the surface thereof. Sputter etching is a treatment wherein high frequency voltage is applied between an anode and a cathode in a pressure chamber in a reduced pressure atmosphere, and a cation generated by discharge collides with the fluorine polymer film in a cathode dark space of high ion energy levels within the discharge zone. In the present invention, in order to obtain a uniformly treated surface at a practical speed of sputter etching, the sputter etching is usually carried out at room temperature under reduced pressure of from 10 to 10 Torr. 1.33 X 10 4 to 10 2 Pa . In the sputter etching used in the present invention, the product of the discharge power and the treating time, i.e., the amount of discharge power treatment, is set within a range of from 0.1 to 20 Watt. sec cmê. If the amount of discharge power treatment is less than O.1 Watt sec cm2, it is difficult to impart sufficient adhesiveness to the fluorine resin film, and if the amount thereof is more than 20 Wattsec cm2, the film tends to deform. The discharge power is usually from 0.01 to 5 Watt cm2, and preferably from 0.1 to 2 Watt cm2. The treating time should naturally be prolonged as the discharge power decreases. From the practical standpoint, it is desirable to increase the discharge power and shorten the treating time. In general, the treating time is from 1 to 10 seconds. High frequency voltage of from several hundred KHz to several ten MHz can be employed, but a frequency of 13.56 MHz available as commercially is used to practical advantage. Many kinds of gases may be used as the atmosphere for the sputter etching, but, in general, inert gases e.g., argon or nitrogen , air, steam or carbon dioxide ars employed. An example of the sputter etching apparatus which can preferably be used in the present invention is explained below by reference to Fig. 1. Reference numeral 11 represents a pressure reduction chamber, to which an exhaust pipe 12 and a gas introducing conduit 13 are connected. Gases in the chamber are exhaust ed through the exhaust pipe, and a gas is introduced in the chamber through the conduit to thereby maintain the atmosphere in the chamber under a prescribed reduced pressure. An electrode 15 for sputter etching of a fluoro polymer film 14 is held within the chamber and electrically insulated from the chamber. An airtight lead wire 16 connects the electrode 15 with a high frequency electric source 18 via a matching box 17 having an impedance matching circuit composed of a capacitor C and an inductor L. Further, a shielding electrode 19 for the electrode 15 and an opposing electrode 20 are connected to the ground side of the high frequency electric source 18. When the pressure reduction chamber 11 is made of an electrically conductive metal, the chamber is connected to the ground side of the high fre quency electric source. Referring to the above described apparatus, the mechanism of sputter etching is explained below. When the potential of the electrode 15 is positive with respect to the opposing electrode 20, the positive ions resulting from the discharge are accelerated and collide with the surface of the fluoro polymer film 14 to thereby perform sputter etching. The positive charge is stored on the surface of the polymer film to increase the surface potential.As a result, a difference in potential between the film surface and the opposing electrode 20 is reduced so that it becomes difficult to maintain discharging. However, in a next half cycle of the high frequency voltage, the potential of the electrode 15 with respect to the opposing electrode 20 becomes positive. Hence, an electron enterss the surface of the polymer film from the discharge space to neutralize the positive ions stored on the surface. As a result, in the next half cycle of the high frequency voltage, the potential of the electrode 15 with respect to the opposing electrode 20 again becomes negative, making a large enough difference to permit discharge.Thus, the collision of positive ions against the polymer film surface and the neutralization of the positive ion stored on the polymer film surface are alternately repeated in every cycle of the high frequency voltage, to thereby accomplish sputter etching of the polymer film surface. The process for producing an elastomeric rubber pl ug in accordance with this invention will be below by reference to Figs. 2, 3 and 4. Referring to Fig. 2, a fluoro polymer film 31 having its surface sputter etched as described above is placed in a lower mold 32 having a plug shaped cavity, and an unvulcanized rubber sheet 33 is laminated thereon. After an upper mold not shown is mounted thereon, the laminate is heated at a prescribed temperature under a prescribed pressure to shape it to a plug. A rubber plug 35 composed of shaped vulcanized rubber 34 on the surface of which is laminated the fluoro polymer film 31 can thus be obtained, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows another embodiment of the rubber plug according to the present invention, wherein the plug has a long leg portion 36 and the fluoro polymer film 31 is laminated on only the leg portion of the rubber plug 35. By the process of this invention, an excellent adhesion is obtained between the film of fluoro polymer and the rubber, easily and precisely, since the adhesive properties can be maintained even if the sputter etched surface of the polymer film is stretched in the shaping. This invention will now be illustrated in greater detail by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE I One surface of a 50 pm thick ethylene tetrafluoroethylene copolymer ETFE film EP520, produced by Daikin .Kogyo Co., LTd. was subjected to sputter etching in a vacuum chamber under a pressure of 10 2 Torr with the amount of discharge treatment discharge power x treating time of 0.05 Wattsec cmê Condition A , 0.1 Wattsec cmê ConditionB or 5 Watt.sec cmê Condition C . For comparison, the same ETFE film was subjected to corona discharge treatment at a frequency of 110 KHz, a discharge power of 150 Watt m2 and a film feed rate of 5 m min Condition D . Further, stretched film samples were prepared from films treated under Condition C or D at a stretch ratio shown in Table 1 below. Then, unvulcanized rubber of the following compounding formulation was kneaded using a two roll rubber mill or an internal mixer according to the method as described inGomu Shikenho Test Methods for Rubber , pp. 108 118, edited by The Japan Rubber Association to prepare a rubber sheet having a thickness of 8 mm.

A 10 mm wide strip was cut from each resulting sample sheet, and a 180C peeling test was conducted at a temperature of 20 C or 250C and at a peel rate of 200 mm min to evaluate the adhesive strength. In some runs, an adhesive CHEMLOK registered trademark , a product ofHughson Chemical, Lord Corp. was coated on the treated surface of the film and the unvulcanized rubber sheet was laminated thereon. The results obtained are shown in Table 1 below.

It is apparent from Table 1 that the fluoro polymer film which had been subjected to sputter etching according to the present invention exhibits markedly improved adhesion to rubber without exception, ipared o the cases of using stretched films. It can be seen that the adhesion imparted by the corona discharge treatment disappears by stretching of the fluoro polymer resin. EXAMPLE 2 Each of the film samples treated under Condition C or D and the non treated film as prepared in Example 1 was placed on the surface of a lower mold, and the unvulcanized rubber sheet as prepared in Example 1 was laminated on the film. An upper mold was mounted thereon, and the material was heated at 1600C under a pressure of 50 kg cm2 for 15 minutes to thereby cause vulcanization of the rubber simultaneously with adhesion between the rubber and the ETFE film. The adhesion between the rubber and the ETFE film of the resulting rubber plugs was visually evaluated to obtain a percentage of rejects. In the determination of the percentage of rejects, 1280 laminated rubber plugs were produced in each run by repeating a molding cycle 20 times, each producing 64 laminated rubber plugs. The results obtained are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Treating Percentage Run No. Condition Adhesive of Rejects Remark 1 C used 3 Invention 2 C not used 0 n 3 D used 12 Comparison 4 D not used 100 5 untreated used 100 6 untreated not used 100 It can be seen from Table 2 that the laminated rubber plugs according to the present invention are free from peeling of the polymer film due to poor adhesion during the molding as compared with the plugs wherein corona discharge treated films are used. Therefore, the present invention makes it possible to produce fluoro polymer laminated rubber plugs with a markedly decreased percentage of rejects. ExAMPLE 3 A surface of a 100 pm thick film each of a tetrafluoroethylene perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymer PFA Teflon 500PL, produced by Mitsui Fluoro Chemicals Inc. , a tetrafluoroethylene hexafluoropropylene copolymer FEP Neoflon FEP EF 0100, produced by Daikin Kogyo Co., Ltd. and polyvinylidene fluoride PVDF KF Polymer, rnr duc ed by Kureha Kagaku Kogyo KK was subjected to sputter etching in a vacuum chamber of 2 x 10 3 Torr under a discharge condi 2 tion of 10 Watt sec cm2. Fluoro polymer laminated rubber plugs were produced in the same manner as described in Example 2 but using each of the above treated films and also untreated films, and a percentage of rejects was determined in the same manner as in Example 2. The results obtained are shown in Table 3 below.
