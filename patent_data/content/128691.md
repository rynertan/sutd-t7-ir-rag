# REACTION INJECTION MOULDED POLYURETHANE ELASTOMERS

## Abstract
In the production of reaction injection moulded poly rethane elastomers from methylene bis phenylisocyanate MDI an active hydrogen containing polyether and an amine terminated chain extender, the use as polyether of a primary or secondary amine terminated polyether in which more than 50 of the active hydrogens are amino hydrogens, makes it possible to use MDI containing more than 10 of the 2,4 isomer, without jeopardizing the properties of the finished moulded part.
