## Description
STRUCTURAL MEMBERS OF COMPOSITE WOOD MATERIAL AND A PROCESS FOR THEIR MANUFACTURE This invention relates to structural members made from a composite wood material comprised of wood flakes bonded together with a binder. It is known to manufacturer flat particle board from comminuted wood by mixing the wood particles with a suitable binder such as a synth etic thermosetting resin, forming the mixture into a mat, and then compressing the mat between heated platens to set the binder and bond the wood particles together in a densified form. In this type of process, the wood particles are deposited so they are either randomly oriented relative to each other or oriented to cross each other. However, structural members of l inch thick ness or more produced by such processes generally have strength properties, particularly bending strength along the longitudinal axis, which are inferior to solid wood. According to the present invention there is provided a structural member made from a composite wood material containing a binder characterised in that the wood material comprises elongate wood flakes bonded together with said binder, said wood flakes having a grain direction extending generally parallel to the longitudinal axis thereof and at least a majority being oriented such that the longitudinal axis of the flakes is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of said structural member. The present invention, according to another aspect, provides a method for making a structural member of a composite wood material which comprises admixing wood flakes with a binder, forming a mat of said mixture and applying pressure to said mat to bond the flakes together, characterised by the preliminary steps of providing elongated wood flakes having a grain direction extending generally parallel to the longitudinal axis thereof and, after admixture with said binder, forming a layered mat of the resulting mixture with at least a majority of the wood flakes oriented such that the longitudinal axis thereof is generally parallel to the axis of the structural member to be formed from the mat. In a preferred method for making an elongated structural member, such as a building beam, a guard rail post or the like, wood flakes having an average length of about 0.5 inch to about 3.5 inches, an average length to average width ratio of about 4 1 to about 10 1 and an average thickness of about 0.01 to about 0.05 inch are used. A suitable binder, such as a resinous particle board binder is admixed with the wood flakes and the resulting mixture or furnish is formed into a loosely felted melt with at least a majority, preferably about 90 or more, of the wood flakes oriented such that their longitudinal axis is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the structural member to be formed from the mat.Sufficient pressure is applied on the mat, such as with platens either heated or at room temperature , to compress the mat to the desired thickness of the structural member and to bond the wood flakes together. The resultant structural member usually has a density of about 38 to about 50, preferably about 42 to about 45 lbs ft3. The resulting structural member preferably contains about 5 to 12 weight of the binder and, optionally, additives, such as wax, for waterproofing and preservat ves for protection against decay fungi and insects. Organic polyisocyanates are the preferred binder because of the higher strength properties provided thereby. In one embodiment, separate elongated structural components are formed and two or more are joined together in angular relationship with a suitable adhesive to form an elongated structural member having an I beam, angle bar, channel bar, etc. configuration. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accomanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a fragmentary, perspective view of a solid, one piece structural member made in accordance with the invent ion. Fig. 2 is a fragmentary perspective view of a three piece structural member, having an I beam configuration, made in accordance with the invent ion. Fig. 3 is a fragmentary perspective view of a two piece structural member, having an angle bar configuration, made in accordance with the invention. Fig. 4 is an enl lrged, top plan view of an exemplary wood flake used for making structural members in accordance with the invention. DESCRIPTION OF TITLE PPEFERRED EMBODIMENTS Illustrated in Fig. 1 is an elongated structural member 10 made from a composite wood material in accordance with the invention and having a cross sectional dimension corresponding to a standard lumber 2 X 4. The structural member 10 is molded or pressed as a solid one piece unit from a mixture of wood flakes 12 and a suitable t esinc.us particle board binder as described in more detail below. As shown in Fig. 4, the wood flakes 12 illustrated at about 2 times normal size are elongated and have a grain direction designated by reference numeral 14 extending generally parallel to the longitudinal axis 16 thereof.As shown inFig. 1, at least a majority of the wood flakes 12 making up the structural member 10 is oriented so that the planes thereof are coextensive or generally parallel to each other and their longitudinal axis 16 is generally parallel to the longitudinal axis 18 of the structural member 10. In other words, the grain direction of the thus oriented wood flakes extends generally parallel to the longitudinal axis 18 of the structural member 10 in a manner similar to a 2 X 4 of natural wood. Figs. 1 and 2 fragmentarily illustrate multi piece structural members 20 and 40 made from a composite wood material in accordance with the invent ion. The structural member 20 ilLustrated inFig. 2 has an l beam configuration and includes seprate elon. t ite , generally flat, structural components 22, 24 and 26. Each of the structural components 22, 24 and 26 is molded from a mixture of wood flakes 12 and a binder in the same general manner outlined above. That is, at least a majority of the wood flakes 12 makino up each of the structural components is oriented so that their planes are coextensive or generally parallel to each other and their longitudinal axis 16 is gene rally parallel to the longitudinal axis 28, 30 and 32 of the respective structural components 22, 24 and 26.The opposite longitudinal edges 34 and 36 of the intermediate component 24 are bonded to components 22 and 26 by a suitable high strength adhesive 38, such as resorcinol or isocyanate type adhesive or other adhesives suitable for bonding wood products. The structural member 40 illustrated inFig. 3 has an angle bar configuration and includes separate elongated, generally flat, structural components 42 and 44 which are molded from a wood flakes binder mixture and bonded together with an adhesive as described above in connection with the I bean structural member 30. As with the components for the I beam construction, at least a majority of the wood flakes 12 making up the structural compo nents 42 and 44 is oriented so that their planes are coextensive or generally parallel to each other and their longitudinal axis 16 is generally parallel to the longiyudinal axis 46 and 48 of the structural components 42 and 44. The process of the invention will now be described in more detnil. The process broadly includes the steps of comtnlnuting small logos, branches or rough pulp wood into flake like particles, drying the wood flakes to a predetermined moisture content, classifying the dried flakes to a predetermined size, blending predetermined quant i ties of a suitable binder, and optionally a liquid wax composition, preservatives and other additives with the dried and sized flakes, forming the resultant mixture or furnish into a loosely felted, layered mat single or multi layered and applying sufficient pressure with or without heat on the mat to compress it to the desired thickness for the structural member or components there for and to bond the wood flakes together. Wood flakes used can be prepared from various species of suitable hardwoods and softwoods.Representative examples of suitable woods include aspen, maple, elm, balsam fir, pine, cedar, spruce, locust, beech, birch, Douglas fir and mixtures thereof. Wood exhibits directional strength properties with the strength along the grain being far greater than across the grain. In order to maximize strength of the resulting structural member, the wood flakes are prepared so that the grain direction is generally parallel to the major Longitudina1 axis thereof and the flakes are oriented or aligned during mat formation so that their planes are coxcensive or generlLly para11eL to each other and at least a majority, preferably 90 or more, have their grain direction aligned with a predetermined axis of the structural member.For elongated structural members used for applications where a high loading strength along the longitudinal axis is required, such as the structural members 10, 20 and illustrated in Figs. 1 3, the grain direction of the flakes is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the structural members. The wood flakes can be prepared by various conventional techniques. For examples, pulpwood grade logs or so called roundwood, can be converted into flakes in one operation with a conventional roundwood flaker. Alternatively, logs, logging residue with a total tree can be cut into fingerlings in the order of 0.5 to 3.5 inches long with a conventiona.l device, such as the helical comminuting shear disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,0.53,004, and the finge rlings flaked in a conventional ring type flaker. The woods preferably are debarked prior to flaking. Roundwood flakes generally are preferred because the lengths and thickness can be more accurately controlled and the width and shape are more uniform.Also, roundwood flakes tend to be somewhat flatter which facilitates their alignment during mat formation. Roundwood flakes generally produce lesser amounts of undesirable fines. For best results, wood flakes should have an average length of about 0.5 inch to about 3. 5 inches, preferably about 1 inch to about 2 inches, and an average thickness of about 0.01 to about 0.05, preferably about 0.015 to about 0.025 inch and most preferably about 0.02 inch.Flakes longer than about 3.5 inches tend to curl which hinders proper alignment during mat formation and it is difficult to insure that flakes shorter than about 0.5 inch do not become aligned with their grain direction cross sise. Flakes thinner than about 0.01 inch tend to require excessive amounts oE binder to obtain adequate bonding and flakes thicker than about 0.05 inch are relatively stiff and tend to require excessive compression to obtain the desired intimate contact therebetween. In any given batch, some of the flakes can be shorter than 0.5 inch and some can be longer than 3.5 inches so long as the overall average length is within the above range. The same is true for the thickness. To facilitate proper alignment, the flakes should have a length which is several times the width, preferably about 4 to about 10 tines. Using this constraint as a guide, the average width of the flakes generally should be about 0.1 to about 0.5 inch. While the flake size can be controlled to a large degree during the flaking, operation, it is usually necessary to use some classification in order to remove undesired particles, both undersized and oversized, and thereby insure the average length, thickness and width of the flakes are within the desired ranges. Flakes from some green woods can contain up to 90 moisture. The moisture content of the mat must be substantially less for the pressing operation. Also, wood flakes tend to stick together and com.plicate classificati6n and handling prior to blending. Accordingly, the flakes preferably are dried prior to classification in a conventional dryer to the moisture content desired for the blending step. The moisture content to which the flakes are dried depends primarily on a particular binder used and usually is in the order of about 3 to about 20 weight or less, based on the dry weight of the flakes. If desired, the flakes can be partially dried prior to classification and then dried to the desired moisture content for blending after classification. This two step drying can reduce overall energy requirements for drying flakes prepared from green woods when substantial quantities of improperly sized flakes must be removed during classification and, thus, need not be as thoroughly dried. A known amount of the dried, classified flakes is introduced into a conventional blender wherein predetermined mounts of a binder, and optionally a wax, a preservative and other additives, is applied to the flakes as they are tumbled or agitated in the blender. Suitable binders include those used in the manufacture of particle board and similar pressed fibrous products and other chemical bonding systems.Resinous particle board binders presently are preferred Representative examples of suitable binders include thermosetting resins such as phenol formaldehyde, resorcinolformaldehyde, melamineformaldehyde, urea formaldehyde, urea furfural and condensed furfuryl alcohol resins, and organic polyisocyanates including those curable at room temperatures, either alone or combined with urea or melamine formaldehyde resins.Particularly suitable polyisocyan ates are those containing at least two active isocyanate groups per molecule, including diphenylmethane diisocyanates, rn and p phenylene diisocyanates, chlorophenylene diisocyanates, toluene di and triisocyanates, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, diphenyl ether 2,4,4 triisocyanate, polyphenolpolyisocyanates, particularly diphenyl methane 4,4 diisocyanate. The particular type binder used depends primarily upon the intended use for the structural member. For instance, structural members made with urea formald ehyde resins have sufficient moisture durability for many uses which involve minimal exposure to moisture, but generally cannot withstandextended o utdoor exposure. Phenol formaldehyde and melamine formaldehyde resins provide the structural member with durable properties required for longterm exterior applications. Polyisocyanates, even in lesser amounts, provide greater strengths and resistant to weathering which is comparable to phenol for and formaldehyde and me lamine formaldehyde resins Polyisocyanates can be cured in about the same or less time as urea formaldehyde resins.However, polyisocyanates are more expensive and may require the use of a mold release agent because oE their tendency to stick to metal parts. These factors are balanced against each other when selecting a specific binder to be used. The amount of binder added to the flakes during the blending step depends primarily upon the specific binder used, size, moisture content and type of wood flakes, and the desired properties of the resulting structural member. Generally, the amount of binder added to the flakes is about 5 to about 12 weight , preferably about 6 to about 10 weight , as solids based on the dry weight of the flakes. The binder can be admixed with the flakes in either dry or liquid form. To maximize coverage of the flakes, the binder preferably is applied by spraying droplets of the binder in liquid form onto the flakes as they are being tumbled or agitated in the blender. Moisture resistance of the structural member can be improved by spraying a liquid wax emulsion onto the flakes during the blending step.The amount of wax added generally is about 0.5 to about 5 eight , as solids based on the dry weight of the flakes. When the structural member is to be used for long term exterior applications, a preser vat ire for protecting the wood against attacks by decay fungi and insects is added to the wood flakes during or before the bending step. Any preservat ive which is compatible with the adhesive system be used. Typical for examp es, include pentachlorophenol, creosote, chromated copper arsenate, ammonical copper arsenate and the lie. It has been found that effective amounts of such preservatives, up to about 5 weight , can be added to the wood flakes without producing an appreciable reduction in the structural strength of the resulting structural member, i.e., the loss in strength is about the same as solid wood treated with the sanie preservatives. Other additives, such as coloring agents, fire retardants and the like may also be added to the flakes during or before the blending step. The binder, wax and other additives can be added separately or in any sequence or in combined form. The moistened mixture of flakes, binder, wax, preservative, etc. or furnish from the blending step is formed into a loosely felted, single or multi layered mat which is compressed into a solid, one piece structural member, such as structural member 10 illustrated in Fig. 1, or components for assernbly of multi piece structural mernbers, such as the components for structural members 20 and 40 illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Generally, the moisture content of the furnish after completion of blending, including the original moisture content oE the flakes and the moisture added during blending the binder, wax and other additives, siiould be about 5 to about 25 weight , preferably about 10 to about 20 weight General,, hither moisture contents within t11ese ranges can be used for polyisocyanate binders. The furnish is formed bv suitable apparatus into a generally flat, looseLy felted mat, either single on muLtiple layers, and the mat is placed in a suitable press wherein it is compressed to consolidate the wood flakes into a structural member of the desired size and cross sectional shape. For example, the furnish can be deposited on a plate like carriage carried on an endless belt or conveyor from one or more hoppers spaced above the belt in the direction of travel. When a multi layered mat is formed, a plurality of hoppers is used with each having a dispensing or forming head extending across the width of the carriage for successively depositing a separate layer of the furnish as the carriage is moved beneath the forming heads. In order to produce structural members having the desired strength characteristics, the mat should have a substantially uniform thickness and the flakes aligned during mat formation with the orientation discussed above. The mat thickness can be controlled primarily by appropriately metering the flow of furnish from type forming head. The Slakes can be aligned by using a lateraLly spaced bjffl ing system or other suitable means located between the former heads and the carriage and arranged to guide the elongated flakes into the desired orientation as they are deposited on the carriage or previously deposited layer s oE furnish. The mat thickness will vary depending upon such factors as the size and shape of the wood flakes, the particular technique used in forming the mat, the desired thickness and density of the structural member or component and the pressing pressure used. The mat thickness usually is about 5 to 6 times the final thickness of the structural member or component. For example, for a structural component having a 1 inch thickness and a density of about 40 lbs. ft. 3, the mat usually will be about 5 6 inches thick. If the mat is thicker than about 25 30 inches, it usually enust be partially pre compressed to a reduced thickness, with rollers or the like, prior to introduction into the press. Pressing temperatures, pressures and times, vary widely depending on the thickness and the desired density of the structural member or component, size and type of wood flakes, moisture content of the flakes and the type of binder. The pressing temperature used is sufEicierit to at least partially cure the binder and expel water from the mat within a reasonable time period and without charring the wood Generally, a pressing ten1pera ture ranging from ambient for room temperature curable binders up to about 450 F can be used.Temperatures above 450 F can cause charring of Lhe wood flakes. A pressing temperature of about 250 to about 375 F is generally preferred for polyisocyanate binders which does employ a catalyst and a temperature of about 350 to about 4250F is generally preferred or phenolformaldehyde resin binders. The pressure should be sufficient to press the wood f flakes into intimate contact with each other without crushing them to the point causing a breakdown of fibers with a resultant degradation in structural integrity. The pressure usually is about 325 to about 500 psi. The pressing time is sufficient to at least partially cure the binder to a point where the structural member or component has sufficient integrity for handling. The press cycle typically is about 2 to about 20 minutes however, longer times can be used when pressure curing binders are employed or when more complete curing of thermosetting binders is desired. While solid woods of different species typically exhibit vastly different strength properties, it has been found that the strength properties oE structural members made in accordance with the invention are substantially the same for a wide variety oE high strength and low strength species.Thus, species heretofore not considered useful for structural products can be used without sacrificing strcn proper ties. Also, the strength properties of the composite wood material are more uniform than solid wood because of the absence of knots or other grain inconsistencies normally present in solid woods.
