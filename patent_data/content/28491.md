# Electrical connector for mounting a flat transducer on a printed circuit board.

## Abstract
An electrical connector for mounting a flat piezo electric transducer on a printed circuit board comprising two resi lient metal strips 12, 12 having a plurality of coplanar, perimetrically spaced, hook forming portions 20, 21 and 20 , 21 adjacent respective ends and being adapted to be connected to the printed circuit board 10 with a plane containing all the hook forming portions 20, 21 and 20 , 21 parallel to the printed circuit board 10 , and, a resilient contact arm 25 or 53, 53 adapted to be connected to upstand from the printed circuit board 10 surrounded by the hook forming portions 20, 21 and 20 , 21 or 40, 41 and 40 , 41 . Resilient flexure of the ends of the strips 12 or 12 relatively apart in a plane parallel to the plane of the printed circuit board 10 , permits engagement of an edge portion 8 of the transducer 2 by all the hook forming portions 20, 21 and 20 21 with a central portion 6 of the transducer 2 depressing the contact arm 25 .
