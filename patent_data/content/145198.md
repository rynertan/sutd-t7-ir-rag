# Digital motor control method and means.

## Abstract
A method and system for controlling a digital motor to allow operation in a microstepping mode at low velocities where microstepping is advantageous and to allow opera tion in a non microstepping mode at high motor velocities to take advantage of the higher torque attainable. The transition from microstepping to non microstepping or from non microstepping to microstepping is accomplished free of velocity perturbations in the motor phases.
