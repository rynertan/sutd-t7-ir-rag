# Improvements in conveyor chains and conveyors.

## Abstract
A conveyor chain comprises a plurality of links 19 joined together with a plurality of pins 20 , and a plurality of spacers 21 . Each pin 20 penetrates end portions of two pairs of links 19 for chaining the links into first and second spaced apart side length portions and the links and pins cooperate for transmitting tensile stress imposed on the chain. Each of the plurality of spacers 21 is penetrated by at least one pin 20 and has a carrier portion projecting from the chain for engaging an object to be moved with the chain. The carrier portion may comprise clips 24 for receiving and gripping rod like axles 25 of conveyor rollers 28 or grip pers for partially encircling a pair of objects to be moved with the chain.
