# Apparatus for upsetting tube ends.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for upsetting a tube end using a one piece upset die 42 . The tube 30 is heated at the end to be upset and secured in a gripper clamp 32 so as to remain stationary during the upset operation. The upset die 42 is hydraulically forced over the tube end and a mandrel 36 is hydraulically positioned into the tube end. A longitudinal compressive force is then hydraulically applied to upset the tube end. The upset die 42 is hydraulically pulled off the upset tube 30 thereby accomplishing removal of the tube 30 from the one piece die 42 without damage to the tube 30 or the die 42 .
