# Sampled data fir filters with enhanced tap weight resolution.

## Abstract
A finite impulse response sampled data filter is provided with parallel tapped delay lines 37 41 32 36 to one of which scaled 31 input samples are applied and to the other of which non scaled samples are applied. The scaled and non scaled signal samples from the parallel tapped delay lines are both made available to weighting circuits 42 46 for utilization thereby in producing weighted samples which are added 47 to produce the filtered output samples.
