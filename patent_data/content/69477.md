## Abstract
Channel selection in a frequency hopping radio set is controlled by a pseudo random number generator, the pseudo random number being used to address an N bit memory 3 which is used to identify each of n available channels from N equipped channels. When a preselected number of the n channels have been identifed by the pseudo random number generator a latch 4 is enabled to store the channel number for selection purposes. Various scrambling methods are employed so that the channels on which one network of radio sets is operating is not readily identifiable from the channels on which another network of radio sets is operating.
