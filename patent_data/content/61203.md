# Machine gun and ejection system therefor.

## Abstract
An externally powered twin barrel machine gun includes a shuttle 42 having two firing chambers 64 , 66 . The shuttle linearly moves between two positions so that the firing chambers are alternately fed a round of ammunition and discharged. A feed system 21 has a pair of augers 23, 24 each with a helical groove 26 therein which receives a round of ammunition which obtains a dwell position on a zero pitched section 28 of the grooves. A ramming system 91 rams a round of ammunition to the firing chamber aligned therewith and simultaneously ejects any ,spent cartridge through a forward aperture 62 in the housing 16 . The spent cartridge is frictionally engaged by an axially aligned acceleration belt 76 which quickly withdraws the spent cartridge from the firing chamber and accelerates it onto a deflection cam 88 .
