## Description
The present invention relates to the preparation of sorbents, and more particularly to inorganic oxide sorbent compositions which are particularly useful for the removal of sulfur oxides from gas mixtures. Alumina containing compositions have been used for many years to remove sulfur oxide components from gas streams such as stack gas. U.S. 2,992,884 and 3,501,264 disclose the preparation and use of solid alkalized alumina adsorbents which are used to selectively remove sulfur components such as sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, and hydrogen sulfide from flue gas. U.S. 3,974,256 and 4,002,720 describe methods for removing hydrogen sulfide from gas mixtures wherein the sorbent capacity of a regenerable sorbent composition comprising alumina rare earths is increased by the addition of alkaline earth metal promoter. U.S. 4,259,176 describes the removal of sulfur oxides from cracking catalyst regeneration flue gas using a particulate solid alumina sorbent in the presence of a zeolite cracking catalyst which contains restricted quantities of silica. U.S. 4,206,039 describes a fluid catalytic cracking process wherein the emissions of sulfur oxides are reduced by including a metallic reactant typically alumina ceria that reacts to sulfur oxides in the regeneration zone. While it is generally recognized that alumina containing sorbents may be used to remove sulfur containing components from gas streams, it is frequently found that the cost of an effective sorbent is excessive, particularly when used in the large quantities required for maintaining commercial applications such as stack gas cleanup. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide effective low cost sorbent compositions. It is another object to provide alumina containingSOx sorbents that may be economically produced from low cost raw materials. It is yet a further object to provide a method by which clay kaolin may be economically converted to a highly effective sorbent. It is still another object to provide an improved method for removing SO components from stack gas streams generated during the combustion of sulfur containing hydrocarbons in processes such as power generation and cracking catalyst regeneration. These and still further objects of the present invention will become readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following detailed description and specific examples. Broadly, our invention contemplates alkali alkaline earth metal containing spinel alumina sorbent compositions which are largely derived from clay. More specifically, we have found that highly effective sorbents may be obtained by the following process. 1. Clay preferably kaolin and alumina sol preferably chlorhydrol are combined to obtain a formable mixture. 2. The mixture is formed into particles of desired shape and size, preferably by spray drying, to obtain particulate clay alumina sol composites. 3. The composites are calcined at a temperature of about 1700 22000F, preferably about 18000F, to convert the clay to spinel and amorphous silica, and the alumina sol component to a cohesive alumina binder. 4. The calcined composites are reacted with an alkali metal hydroxide solution, preferably sodium hydroxide solution to solubilize and remove leach amorphous silica produced during calcination as solubilized alkali metal silicate. 5. The leached composites are then washed to remove residual solubilized silicate. 6. The washed composites are combined with alkali and or alkaline earth metal components to convert the spinel alumina particles to the preferred alkali or alkaline earth metal exchanged, precipitated and or impregnated form. 7. Alkali metal and or alkaline earth metal containing spinel alumina composites may then be dried, and if desired, further processed, i.e. granulated, pilled, extruded or formed into spheres to obtain sorbent particles of desired shape, size and form. 8. The formed composites are finely activated at a temperature of from about 250 to 18000F, either prior to or during use. The finished alkali alkaline earth metal spinel alumina composites sorbent compositions have the following characteristics. a An alkali metal or alkaline earth metal content of from about 1 to 15 percent by weight, calculated as M2O or M O where M is an alkali metal such as sodium and potassium, and M1is an alkaline earth metal such as calcium and magnesium which are included in ion exchanged, precipitated and or impregnated form. b An alumina binder content of from about 5 to 25 percent by weight calculated as Al 203 c A spinel content of from about 95 to 75 percent by weight, wherein the spinel component has a 2.0 to 0.40 A12O3.SiO2 mole ratio. In addition, the sorbent composition has the following physical characteristics 2 a A surface area of from about 100 to 300 m g as measured by BET nitrogen absorbtion technique. b A pore volume distribution which is characterized as follows 1 A total pore volume of from about 0.30 to 0.60 cc g. 2 A maximum number of pores in pores between 30 and 55 AO in diameter. 3 Little or no pore volume in pores less than 200 AO in diameter. 4 A pore volume distribution as follows 0.15 to 0.40 cc g in pores of less than 100 AO in diameter, 0.05 to 0.20 cc g in pores ranging from 100 to 600 AO in diameter, and 0.05 to 0.20 cc g in pores above 600 AO in diameter. c Particle size 1 Ranging preferably from about 20 to 200 microns when the product is prepared in spray dried form. 2 Ranging from 0.2 to 4 mm when the sorbent composition is prepared in forms of pills, granules, extrudates and spheres. 3 A crush strength of from about 5 to 50 lbs as measured by two point crush on 32 mm extrudates. 4 An attrition resistance characteristic of from about 2 to 20 as measured by the Davison Index DI and 0.2 to 2.0 Jersey Index JI as determined by the methods set forth in U.S. 4,247,420. The compositions have a high capacity for the sorbtion of sulfur oxides. Typically the sorbent can sorb up to 25 percent of its initial weight as sulfur oxides measured as SO2 . More specifically, the sorbents are evaluated using the so called QSOx Test described below , the QSO Number or QSOIndex will typically range from 500 to 5,000 when tested at a level of 10 percent admixed with 90 percent of a commercial FCC catalyst which has a QSO Index of less than 200. QSOx test and QSO number is determined as follows 1. A catalyst sorbent sample is steam deactivated for 6 hours at 14000F in 100 steam atmosphere at 5 PSI pressure prior to evaluation. 2. 10 g of the sample was placed in a furnace and heat treated one half hour at 12500F in atmosphere comprising 2 H2 98 N2 to remove regenerable sulfur if any and residual moisture. 3. The sample is placed in an absorption device and a dynamic adsorption step is conducted at 12500F using SO2 900 PPM S02 in 4 02 with balanceN2 and a breakthrough profile is monitored. 4. A repeat of the dynamic adsorption step on the sulfur saturated sample obtained in 3 allows the S02 to SO3 equilibrium conversion and the system lag to be determined. 5. The difference between the integrated responses from steps 3 and 4 yields a result that is proportional to the sulfur gain by the test sample and this is the QSO number. The compositions are particularly effective for removing SO components of high temperature 500 to 18000F stack gas. The SO containing stack gases are typically generated by the burning of sulfur containing fossil fuels or during industrial processes such as employed in the high temperature regeneration, i.e. oxidation burning, of organic sulfur containing hydrotreating, cracking and hydrocracking catalysts. In one preferred embodiment of the invention the sorbent composition is prepared and spray dried in microspheroidal form having a particle size predominantly in the range of from about 20 to 200 microns. The microspheroidal sorbent composition is then blended with conventional fluid catalytic cracking catalysts FCC catalysts in amounts ranging from about 20 to 250 parts by weight sorbent per 1000 parts by weight FCC catalyst. The FCC catalysts utilized in this embodiment of the invention are commercially available and typically comprise crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites such as rare earth exchanged faujasite type Y zeolites and or the ZSM type zeolites. The FCC catalysts are prepared in accordance with the methods typically disclosed in U.S. patents 3,867,308 and 3,957,689. Having described the basic aspects of the present invention, the following examples are given to illustrate particular embodiments thereof. Example 1 Spray dried microspheres were prepared with 10 percent Al 203 sol binder and 90 percent kaolin clay dry basis by slowly combining 10,465 g kaolin clay, 4,255 g chlorhydrol and sufficient H20 to obtain a pumpable slurry. The slurry was spray dried at a temperature of 3250F outlet air the resulting microspheres were calcined for 1 hour at 18000F. 500 g of the calcined microspheres were added to 1.0 1 of water containing 225 g NaOH and boiled 1 hour under reflux with slow agitation. The slurry was filtered and washed with hot deionized water. The washed material was exchanged two times with 65 g NH4 2SO4 in 1.0 1 water for one half hour at 1500F pH adjusted to 5.0 with acid aluminum sulfate solution for the first exchange , washed with hot deionized water, and then oven dried. The sample was given a hydrothermal steam deactivation by heating for 6 hours at 14000F with 5 lbs. steam pressure, and then subjected to a QSO test which measures totalSOX pickup. The sorbent prepared in this example has QSO number of 3366 at 100 loading . The sorbent composition which is primarily in the H exchange form contained 73.9 weight percent A1203, 0.25 weight percent Na2O and the balance SiO2. Example 2 This example indicates that a calcium exchanged version of the sorbent prepared as in example 1 demonstrated improved SO pickup capability, i.e. a high QSOx number. A sample of the calcined, caustic leached microspheres obtained in example 1 was reslurried in water. The pH adjusted to 7.0 with 3 percent HC1 solution and 100 g Caul2 was added. The mixture was held one half hour at 1500F, filtered, and washed with hot deionized water. The Caul2 exchange was repeated without pH adjustment. The slurry was filtered, washed with hot deionized water, and oven dried. The resulting sorbent composition contained 69.66 percent Al203 and 0.42 percent Na2O, 2.84 weight percent CaO and the balance SiO2. This sample had a QSOx number of 6038 repeat 7716 at 100 percent loading after a 14000F, 6 hour, 100 steam at 5PSI pressure deactivation, indicating improved SOx pickup relative to the H form. Example 3 This example shows the improved SO sorbing capability of a sorbent which is in a predominently sodium exchanged form. The starting microspheres for this sample were prepared from a slurry which contained 12.5 weight percent A1203 as Al 203 sol chlorhydrol having the composition 68.5 K20, 23.5 A1203, 8.0 C1 , and 87.5 weight percent kaolin.The slurry was spray dried in a large commercial dryer operated at a gas inlet temperature of 6000F and outlet of 3250F. The microspheres were initially calcined at 12500F and then recalcined for one half hour at about 19000F. 250 g of the calcined microspheres were added to a solution of 125 g sodium hydroxide in 500 ml deionized water. The mixture was heated 1 hour under reflux, filtered, washed four times with 500 ml hot deionized water and oven dried. This sample which comprises 68.57 percent Al203, 2.72 percent Na2O, balance SiO2. The sorbent had a QSO number of 14,659 at 100 percent loading after a 14000F hydrothermal deactivation for 6 hours at 5 PSI in 100 steam. Example 4 This example shows that a calcium impregnated material is very effective when used in a FCC catalyst blend. 750 g of calcined microspheres, prepared as described in Example 1, were added to 1.5 1 of solution containing 300 g of NaOH and hot aged 1 hour at 1700F with slow mechanical agitation. The slurry was filtered and washed three times in 1.5 1 deionized water. This material was exchanged three times in 1.5 1 solution containing 150 g NH4 2S04 for one half hour at room temperature, with the pH adjusted to 7.0 with 10 weight percent H2SO4 on the first exchange only. After each exchange the sample was washed with deionized water. After oven drying overnight at 2500F, 38.8 g dry basis of the sample was impregnated with 21 ml solution containing 16.8 gCa NO3 2.4H2O, dried at 2500F and then calcined one hour at 12500F. The sorbent sample contained about 9.4 CaO. 5 g of the sample was blended with 45.0 g of a commercial FCC catalyst DA 300 , steam deactivated and tested for SO capability. The sorbent catalyst sample was determined to have a QSO number of 3,937, while the catalyst without sorbent had an average QSOx of about 200 for several tests. Example 5 This example shows that an alkaline earth oxide can be advantageously precipitated from solution onto a sorbent of this invention. 49.0 g as is of caustic leached microspheres prepared as in Example 1 were slurried in 100 ml of H20 containing 5.22 g Caul2, the pH adjusted to 10.0 with slow addition of 2M NaOH, filtered, washed three times with 200 ml deionized water, oven dried overnight at 2500F and then calcined 1 hour at 12500F. After a 14000F steam deactivation a 10 blend of the sorbent with a commercial FCC DA 300 gave a QSO of 927 versus 204 for the catalyst without sorbent. The above examples clearly indicate that valuable, highly efficient SO sorbent compositions may be obtained in using the present invention.
