# Ion implanted magnetic bubble memory device.

## Abstract
An ion implanted magnetic bubble memory device comprises a magnetic layer in which bubble propagation paths are formed by ion implantation. The bubble propaga tion path has an inside turn including a cusp 6 of which the summit deviates towards a direction P of bubble propagation with respect to a cusp center line CL . Such a bubble propogation path permits the ion implanted bubble device to adopt a folded minor loop organization to be realized.
