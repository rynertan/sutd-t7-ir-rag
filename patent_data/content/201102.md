## Description
TITLE ACRYLIC COPOLYMER COMPOSITION AND ADHESIVE COATINGS THEREFROMFIELD OF INVENTION The invention relates to acrylic latex copolymer compositions and to adhesive coatings made therefrom.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The flexible circuit industry requires adhesives for polyimide film and copper which can withstand elevated temperatures and a variety of harsh solvents and chemicals. During the many preparation and processing steps for circuit manufacture, these solvents and chemicals can cause an adhesive to swell. This swelling leads to blister formation and or delamination, which results in reduced circuit yields. The application of heat.such as in soldering, can similarly cause circuit failures. In preparing multilayer flexible circuits, manufacturers need adhesive coated polyimide films which can effectively encapsulate patterned metal circuits and also provide a planar surface for subsequent lamination.PRIOR ART Crosslinkable acrylic adhesive compositions which bond to caustic treated polyimide elements are known from U.S. 3,822,175 3.900.662 and 3,728,150.U.S. 3.336,149 and 3,418,392 disclose acrylic adhesive compositions which can be cured for bonding to textile fibers. Combinations of phenolic resins and acrylic copolymers for adhesive compositions are known from U.S. 4,435.543 and 3,376,279. A curable adhesive composition comprising 25 to 64.8 acrylate, 20 to 40 acrylonitrile and 0.2 to 5 glycidyl methacrylate is described in U.S. 4,404,324, whereas U.S. 4,098,952 describes 3 to 25 glycidyl methacrylate.

Latex Copolymer As noted above, the latex copolymer component of the invention is prepared by free radical initiated aqueous emulsion polymerization of a mixture of nonacidic monomers comprising 50 60 wt. lower alkyl acrylate, 30 40 wt. acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, or mixtures thereof, and 5 12 wt. glycidyl acrylate. glycidyl methacrylate or mixtures thereof. The resulting copolymer must have a Tg of O 550C and M of 300,000 2.000,000. As used herein, the term lower alkyl means C14 alkyl groups. When it is desired to have a low flow high viscosity composition. it is preferred that Mw of the w copolymer be 1.500,000 2.000,000. On the other hand.when it is desired to have a high flow low viscosity composition, it is preferred that Mw of the copolymer be 300.000 900.000. Such latex copolymers can be made by conventional latex polymerization techniques such as those disclosed by Sanderson in U.S. 3.032,521. which is incorporated herein by reference. A preferred low flow copolymer is a latex copolymer of 35 55 10 by weight acrylonitrile butyl acrylate glycidyl methacrylate having a Tg of 400C andMw of 1,600.000. A preferred high flow copolymer is one of the same monomer composition, the Mw of which is only 850.000.B. Crosslinking Agent The above described latex copolymers are used in conjunction with 1 10 wt. of a water soluble crosslinking agent such as melamine formaldehyde, phenol formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde and the like.These crosslinkers are present in an amount of about l lOS by weight of terpolymer. A polyvinyl alcohol thickener can be used to vary viscosity. The composition may contain surface tension and viscosity control agents as well as fillers, colorants and flame retardant additives. In particular, 95S latex copolymer is combined with 5a phenol formaldehyde resin to provide a preferred adhesive composition to which about 0.5 by weight polyvinyl alcohol of molecular weight above 100.000 is added as a thickener. Other compatible thickening agents can be employed to facilitate film formation prior to drying.C. Dispersing Medium In most instances. it will be preferred to use the aqueous phase of the copolymer latex as the dispersing medium for the adhesive composition of the invention. However. if desired, the acrylic adhesive can be contained as a dispersion or dissolved in a suitable organic liquid or mixtures of organic liquids. Examples of these are aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane and octane esters such as ethyl acetate ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone and methylisobutyl ketone and ethers such as monoalkylethers of ethylene glycol. Examples of suitable organic liquids are disclosed in U.S. 3.032.521. D. Formulation and Application The adhesive composition can be prepared in an unsupported form by application to a release substrate such as coated paper or application onto polyimide films and or metal sheets and the like.Polyimides suitable for use as substrates in this invention are disclosed in Edwards U.S. 3,179,634. the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The polyimide or other substrate may contain reinforcing and or filler material, for example natural or synthetic fibers such as fiberglass, boron. polyester, polyamide, acrylic, Nomexs and Kevlars, aromatic polyamides. nylon. etc. Woven or nonwoven fabrics made from natural or synthetic fibers such as those mentioned above can also be used. Particular filler materials include silica, silicates, carbon black, carbonates, metals and metal oxides, such as magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxides. etc. The composition may also contain flame retardant materials, such as antimony oxides and or brominated or chlorinated phosphates, for example, tris 2.3 dibromopropyl phosphate. The acrylic adhesive composition can be applied to the substrate film by conventional application procedures such as spraying, drying.printing, brushing. extrusion, dip coating, roll coating and the like. If desired the acrylic adhesive can contain reinforcing and or extender material such as those primarily enumerated as being suitable for the polyimide film. In particular the adhesive composition can be applied to Kaptons polyimide film or used as a bonding medium between Kaptone polyimide film and copper. The adhesive composition can be stored in roll form using coated paper or Molars film. The acrylic adhesive can be applied to the polyimide film or other substrate in varying thickness depending on the desired end use. The acrylic adhesive coated polyimide films can be adhered to suitable substrates to form laminates. Suitable substrates include metal and especially metal foils of copper, copper alloys.silver, silver alloys. gold, gold alloys woven and nonwoven fabrics made from natural or synthetic fibers such as glass, boron, polyester, polyamide, acrylic, etc. woven and nonwoven fabric impregnated with resin such as polyimide. polyamide, epoxy, acrylic paper of natural or synthetic fibers such as Nomexs nylon paper. etc. and film of polymer such as polyimide. polyamide. polyester, acrylic, epoxy, polyurethane, etc. Preferred substrates include metal and especially copper, polyimide film, polyamide paper, woven and nonwoven glass fabric. and polyimide or epoxy impregnated glass fabric. Various techniques can be used to join material surfaces using the adhesive films of the invention. For example when the film has been applied to a release support such as Molar polyester film or polymer coated paper, two materials can be joined by applying the exposed layer of the adhesive film to one of the materials, peeling off the substrate support from the adhesive film, thus exposing a second surface of the adhesive, and then laminating the second layer of material to the exposed surface of the adhesive film under pressure and heat sufficient to effect cross linking of the cross linking agent in the adhesive film. On the other hand when the adhesive film is applied to a nonrelease support, e.g.. a polyimide film the polyimide film can be joined to a second material such as a printed circuit board by laminating the polyimide coated adhesive film to the second material under heat and pressure sufficient to initiate and effect complete cross linking of the crosslinking agent. Standard lamination procedures can be used to make the laminates such as vacuum bag lamination.press lamination. roll lamination, etc. The laminates are useful as circuit boards. structural members and the like. In the examples, the method used for determining the weight average molecular weight Mw is gel permeation chromatography. The analytical procedure consisted of dissolving 0.1 0.3 wt. polymer in tetrahydrofuran THF and chromatographing a sample on a micro Styragele column versus a polymethylmethacrylate PMMA standard having a Mw of 100.000.ExamPle 1 Low Flow Terpolymer In a 2 liter flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. condenser. two addition funnels, a thermometer and nitrogen inlet were placed 380 g of deionized water, 16.4 g of acrylonitrile, 28.2 g of butyl acrylate, 2.3 g of glycidyl methacrylate and 0.01 g of ferric ammonium sulfate.
