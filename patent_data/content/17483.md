# Filter bag retaining system with removable thimble extension.

## Abstract
A removable extension for thimbles used in bag house installations. The extension 52 , which projects below the main body 46 of the thimble 42 , insures that gas entering a filter bag connected to the thimble will have a flow direction aligned with the bag axis such that particulate matter entrained within the gas stream will not impinge on the sides of the filter bag and cause excessive wear. The extension 52 , which need not be secured to the main body a of the thimble 42 , abuts the inner wall surface of the thimble and rests on an annular flange 54 formed in the upper portion of the thimble.
