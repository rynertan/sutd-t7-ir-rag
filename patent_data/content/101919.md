# Color picture tube and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A color picture tube comprises a shadow mask which is formed to, oppose at a small gap therefrom, a phosphor screen formed on the inner surface of a panel. The shadow mask comprises a sheet of a nickel containing iron alloy which contains 0.1 by weight or less of manganese and having an austenite grain number of 7 or less both within and at surfaces of the sheet, the austenite grain number being defined by JIS G 0551 of the Japanese Industrial Standards. The iron alloy sheet is annealed in a vacuum of 10 ยน Torr or less at a temperature of 1,000 C or higher prior to formation into the shadow mask.
