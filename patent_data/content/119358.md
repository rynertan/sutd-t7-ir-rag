## Description
A A FORCE MULTIPLIER The present invention relates to a mechanical force multiplier for multiplying a driving force applied on a driving lever and for transmitting the force multiplied to a driven lever to generate a high press force on a follower of the driven lever. As shown schematically in Figs. 1 and 2, a crank pin mechanism and a toggle joint mechanism are used conventionally as a drive mechanism for the auto drive press having a motor for generating a driving force. Moreover, a cam mechanism as shown in Fig 3 is also employed conventionally in a hand operated press. As is well known to those skilled in the art, the output force P of a slider cooperating with the driven lever is inversely proportional to the velocity V thereof P.V R wherein K is a constant proportional to an energy applied exteriorly . In this connection, the velocity of the slider 1 of the press with a crank pin mechanism varies in a manner generally depicting a sine curve as shown by a velocity distribution VI in Fig. 1 and, therefore, the velocity remains relatively high even during the press stroke of the slider. For this reason, only a relatively low output is obtained. Moreover, large noises and oscillations are generated as the tool mounted on the slider strikes a work at a relatively high velocity. These lower a working accuracy of the work and shorten the life of the tool. As is clear from the velocity distribution V11 of the slider 2 of the press with the toggle joint mechanism shown in Fig. 2, the velocity of the slider 2 at the time that the slider 2 is transferred to the press stroke thereof is low when compared with that of Fig. 1, but the ratio of reduction remains several tense at most. Also, in the hand operated press with a cam mechanism shown in Fig. 3, it is difficult to make an eccentric distance e smaller than a limit, since a radius of the fundamental circle of the cam 3 is limited to a value determined by the strength of the cam needed. For example, since e is limited to 40 to 50rim at least in the conventional hand operated press, the maximum leverage ratio are obtained is at most 20 even though the length of the driving lever 5 is set to 800mm wherein Q is the length of the driving lever . As is clear from the foregoing, the driving mechanism of the conventional hand operated press has a limit with respect to the leverage ratio obtained.Moreover, it is impossible to obtain a high capacity of the auto press without increasing an exterior energy to be supplied by an electric motor or the like and without increasing the size of the press. For example, in a conventional crank press having a capacity of 100 tons, the capacity of the main driving motor needed is 10 HP and the size of the press becomes as large as 3,300 X 2,200 X 1,700 mm3 . For these reasons, positions for the installation of the press are limited and it is difficult for every mechanic to be able to use the press when convenient according to his needs, An object of the present invention is to provide a force multiplier having an amazing leverage ratio, for instance, about ten times larger than that of the conventional mechanical driving mechanism. A further object of the present invention is to provide a force multiplier in which the follower can be moved at extremely low velocity during the press stroke thereof and can be moved at high velocity during the remaining part of the stroke i.e. other than the press stroke. The present invention also seeks to provide a force multiplier which can be employed on divers kind of machines for working on rigid materials with a multiplied force, such as press, shearing, holding machines, or the like. According to the present invention, there is provided a force multiplier comprising a driving lever having a pivot at one end thereof which is perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the driving lever and is mounted on a frame by the pivot pivotably in a plane parallel to the lengthwise direction thereof a guide means rotatable together with the pivot of the driving lever, said guide means extending outwardly in a radial direction perpendicular to the axis of the pivot of the driving lever and passing through the center of the pivot of the driving lever a follower adapted to be guided slidably along the guide means and a driven lever having one end pivotably mounted on the frame at a position different from the pivot of the driving lever and the other end connected to the follower, the swinging radius of the driven lever, defined as a distance between the center of the portion ot the driven lever connected to the follower and the center of pivot of the driven lever, being so determined as to be greater than the distance between the center of pivot of the driving lever and the center of pivot of the driven lever by a predetermined short distance such that, when the driving lever is driven to and fro through a predetermined angle, the follower is moved between the farthest position at which the follower is located farthest from the center of pivot of the driving lever and the nearest position at which the center of the connection between the follower and the driven lever approaches an extremely short distance toward the center of pivot of the driving lever and is decelerated rapidly as it approaches the nearest position. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the pivot of the driving lever has a portion elongated from the center thereof in at least one radial direction thereof by a distance larger than the stroke of the follower. In order to simplify mechanical structures, it is desirable to form said portion of the pivot of the driving lever as a circular disk having a larger radius than that of the pivot and being coaxial therewith and to support said circular disk rotatably on the frame as the pivot of the driving lever. Moreover, mechanical structures can be further simplified if the guide means is formed as a groove or slit extending in the radial direction thereof In this embodiment of the present invention, the follower may be a pin or a square metal engaged in the groove or the slot.The square metal is desirable in order to reduce wear of the guide means due to the slide movement thereof. According to the present invention, the center of the follower can approach the center of the pivot of the driving lever as near as possible and then, the leverage ratio can be increased to an extremely high value. This means, as is clearly understood from the relation P V K mentioned above, that the velocity of the follower is decelerated to a desirable low velocity as the center thereof approaches the center of pivot of the driving lever.Contrary to the above, when the follower moves away from the center of pivot of the driving lever by a suitable distance, the velocity of the. follower is increased corresponding to the distance from the center of pivot of the driving center.Accordingly, the follower can be moved at high velocity except during the press stroke thereof. Advantages which can be obtained when the force multiplier is applied to a press machine are as follows a The capacity of the press can readily be increased by ten times or more, as is obtained easily when compared with a conventional crank press having the same driving source. b Conversely, the press according to the present invention needs only a very small driving force input to obtain the same output as that of a conventional press. This means that the press according to the present invention can be reduced in its volume and or in its weight considerably, c Moreover, the follower has a very good velocity distribution. It can have a high velocity during the part of the up down stroke when it is not pressing the work and, contrary to the above, can have very low velocity during the press stroke against the work. Consequently noise and or oscillation upon the contact of the tool on the work can be reduced or avoided, more accurate working is possible and the life of the tool can be prolonged. d Further, it is possible to press, shear or squeeze a thick steel plate or the like, since it is possible to increase the press stroke with a very low velocity. The present invention will now be further explained, and an embodiment described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are schematic drawings showing driving mechanisms employed in the conventional presses, respectively Fig. 3 is a schematic elevational view showing a cam mechanism employed in the conventional handoperated press Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 are plan views of driving and driven levers used in a force multiplier embodying to the present invention, respectively Fig. 6 is a view showing an essential structure of a force multiplier embodying to the present invention Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 are graphs showing velocity distribution of the follower obtained respectively in the embodiment of the present invention and the conventional toggle joint mechanism Fig. 9 is a perspective view showing a handoperated press in which a force multiplier embodying to the present invention is used Fig. 10 is an enlarged side view of part of the hand operated press shown in Fig. 9 Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 are a right hand side view and a front view, respectively, for showing interior structures of an auto press in which a force multiplier embodying the present invention is used Fig. 13 is a graph showing a velocity distribu tion of the follower of the auto press and Fig. 14 is a side view showing a variation of the driving lever. As shown in Fig. 4, 5 and 6, a force multiplier according to an embodiment of the present invention is substantially composed of two levers, namely a driving lever 10 and a driven level 11. The driving lever 10 has a circular disk 12 having a relatively large radius. The circular disk 12 is connected to one end 10a of the driving lever 10, via a connection portion, to permit the lever 10 to extend outward therefrom in a radial direction thereof. This circular disk 12, as shown in Fig. 6, is rotatably received in an aperture 15 defined in a frame 14 to provide a pivot for pivotal movement of the driving lever 10 in a plane parallel to the lengthwise direction thereof.A groove 16 is provided on the front side of the circular disk 12 in a radial direction thereof. The groove 16 constitutes a guide means. The outer end 16a thereof is located near the outer periphery of the circular disk 12 and the inner end 16b extends a short distance in the lengthwise direction thereof through the center of pivot of the driving lever 10, namely, the center 0 of the circular disk 12. It is to be noted that the lengthwise direction of the groove 16 is not necessarily coincided with that of the driving lever 10 although the both are formed to coincide with each other in this embodiment. The driven lever 11 which constitutes the force multiplier together with the driving lever 10 has a pivot 17 at one end portion lla thereof which projects in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the driven lever 11 and has a pin 18 projecting at the other end portion llb thereof perpendicularly to the lengthwise direction of the driven lever 111 As shown in Fig. 6, the pivot 17 of the driven lever 11 is rotatably received in an aperture 19 in the frame 14 and the pin 18 is slidably engaged in the groove 16 of the circular disk 12. Namely, the pin 18 constitutes a follower defined in the claim. The swinging radius R of the driven lever 11 defined in terms of the distance between the center Ol of the pivot 17 and the center 0,2 of the pin 18 is so determined as to be greater than the distance r between the center Ol of the pivot 17 and the center 0 of pivot of the driving lever 10 by a predetermined short distance e, i.e.,R r e. And, the angle G through which the driving lever 10 should be driven repeatedly is so set to an angle determined by the farthest position A at which the pin 18 is located at the outer end 16a of the groove 16 and the nearest position B at which the center 0,2 of the pin 18 approaches the center 0 of the circular disk 12 by the predetermined short distance e. As clearly understood from the foregoing , it becomes possible to make the center O2 of the pin 18 as the follower approaches the center 0 of pivot of the driving lever 10 by an extremely short distance e. The leverage ratio obtained when the pin 18 attains the nearest positionB is equal to jle, wherein 2 is the length of the driving lever 10 and the force P generated as the output of the device on the pin 18 as the follower is given by the equation P Q e G, wherein G is a driving force applied to the other end lOb of the driving lever 10. Since it is possible to make the short distance e smaller to a degree almost equal to zero, the output P obtained becomes very large. For example, in the case where e is 3mm, the length ss of the driving lever 10 is 720mm andG is 50Kg, the output obtained is 12 tons and the leverage ratio at that time is 240. The reasons why such a large leverage ratio having been never considered in the prior art can be obtained will be hereinafter explained in a different point of view. Fig. 7 shows the velocity distribution V of the pin 18 as the follower obtained according to the present invention and Fig. 8 shows the velocity distribution VTJ of the slider of the press having the toggle joint mechanism shown in Fig. 2. These velocity distributions V and VTJ are obtained under the same conditions for the purpose of comparison, wherein the angle of the pivotal motion of the driving lever is equal to 1300, the stroke of the follower is set equal and each driving lever is driven at a uniform and equal velocity. It is to be noted that the velocity in the range of the press stroke obtained according to the present invention is extremely smaller than that of the slider of the conventional press as is clear from the comparison ofFig. 7 with Fig. 8. Since the output P and the velocity V are in inverse proportional relation to each other as mentioned above, it may be clearly understood that an amazingly large output is obtained according to the present invention as compared with that of the press of toggle joint type. Furthermore, it is to be noted that the follower can be moved at high velocity from the upper end of the whole stroke thereof to the press stroke thereof and can be decelerated rapidly as it approaches the press stroke.Accordingly, if the force multiplier according to the present invention is applied to the press, a favorable velocity distributions of the slider thereof can be obtained because the slider can be moved up and down through almost all the stroke thereof except the press stroke and the work can be pressed quietly at very low velocity with very high press force. A hand operated press employing the force multiplier according to the present invention will now be disclosed. As shown in Fig. 9, the hand operated press is provided with a body frame 24 having a bed 21 for the support of a lower die not shown and an upper block 23 for guiding the slider 22 for the support of an upper die not shown in a vertical direction, with a driving lever 28 connected via a connecting means 27, to a pair of circular disks 26 which are supported rotatably on a pair of side walls 25 as the pivot of the driving lever 28 and with a pair of driven lever 30 mounted pivotably on the side walls 25 by a pin shaft 29. As best shown in Fig. 10 more specifically, there is provided a slot 31 in a radial direction of the circular disk 26, in which a square metal 34 is engaged slidably.The square metal 34 is coupled at the center thereof to a pin shaft 33 by a key 32 for maintaining the both not rotatable with each other. The pin shaft 33 has a sufficient length to be connected to the other driven lever 30 and another square metal 35 is coupled to the middle portion of the pin shaft 33. This square metal 35 is engaged in a square hole 36 provided passing through the upper portion of the slider 22 in a direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction thereof. The width in the longitudinal direction of the square hole 36 is set equal to that of the square metal 35, but the width in the transversal direction thereof is set larger than that of the square metal 35 so as to allow the slide movement of the square metal 35 as the pin shaft 33 is moved along the circular arc locus thereof. Accordingly, the slider 22 can move up and down following only a longitudinal component of the circular arc movement of the pin shaft 33 as the follower. The slider 22 has a guide rod 38 being engaged in a guide hole 37 formed in a vertical direction in the upper block 23 of the body frame 24 and a pair of convex guide means 40 of a triangular section engaged in a pair of guide groove 39 formed inside of the lower portion of the side walls 25 in the vertical direction. With the aid of these upper and lower guide means, the slider 22 is guided smoothly in the vertical direction without causing any axial deviation. Upon operation of the hand operated press mentioned above, the slider 22 is moved downwardly at high velocity by a distance almost equal to 80 of the total stroke thereof when the driving lever 28 is operated to swing through an angle d almost equal to 40 of the total angle of the pivotal movement thereof and, then the slider 22 is decelerated rapidly to a low velocity and is moved downwardly the rest of the total stroke almost equal to 20 thereof during an angle p almost equal to 60 of the total angle. At that time, the upper die mounted on the slider 22 presses the work on the bed 21 with the multiplied force. As mentioned above, a very high capacity of the order of 10 to 20 tons can be obtained easily in the hand operated press of this type. Considering the slide resistivity of the square metal 34, it is desirable to maintain the angle , defined between the center line in the lengthwise direction of the driving lever 28 and the center line in the lengthwise direction of the driven lever equal to or larger than 1050 all over the pivotal movement of the driving lever 28. This assures a smooth slide movement of the square metal 34 along the slot 31 and therefore, a smooth up and down movement of the slider 22. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 show the interior structure of a press with driving motor equipped the force multiplier according to the present invention. Fig. 11 is a right hand side view thereof and Fig. 12 is a front view thereof. In this case, there is provided an electric motor 42 on a bottom portion of box like body frame 41. The electric motor 42 drives via belts 43 a crank disk 44 of a relatively large radius. A crank pin 45 fixed to the crank disk 44 at the outer peripheral portion thereof is connected to a connecting pin 48 by a connecting rod 46, which is fixed to a free end 47a of a driving lever 47. The driving lever 47 is driven to and fro once for each complete rotation of the crank disk 44. The force multiplier itself employed in this press is substantially the same as of mentioned above. Reference numeral 49 is a circular disk having a relatively large radius, reference numeral 50 is a driven lever supported pivotably on the body frame by a pivot 51, reference numeral 52 is a groove provided on the circular disk 49 in a radial direction thereof, reference numeral 53 is a pin shaft as the follower, reference numeral 54 is a square metal engaged slidably in the groove 52, reference numeral 55 is a slider and reference numeral 56 is a bed. The slider 55 is supported by a supporting rod 57 passing therethrough in a horizontal direction and each end of the supporting rod 57 is connected to an upper slide block 60a engaged slidably in a vertical direction between a pair of side walls 58 and 59. Therefore, when the upper slide block 60a slides in the vertical direction, the slider 55 is moved in the vertical direction together with the upper slide block 60a. Under the upper slide block 60a, there is provided a lower slide block 60b by a connecting shaft 61 having a head portion 61a supported between the supporting rod 57 and the bottom surface 60a of the upper slide block 60a and a male threaded portion at the lower part thereof which is engaged with a female threaded hole provided in the lower slide block 60b. The lower slide block 60b is supported by the pin shaft 53 and, therefore, the lower slide block 60b, the connecting shaft 61 and the upper slide block 60a constitute a connecting rod means which connects the pin shaft 53 with the supporting rod 57 for the adjustment of the distance therebetween. A worm wheel 63 is fixed coaxially to the upper side of the connecting shaft 61. The worm wheel 62 is meshed with a worm 64 fixed to one end of a common worm shaft 63. When the worm 64 is driven in one direction, the connecting shaft 61 is rotated around the axis thereof. As a result of the rotation of the connecting shaft 61, the distance between the pin shaft 53 and the supporting rod 57 varies and then the height of the slider 55 against the bed 56 is adjusted to a desirable height. As clearly shown in Fig. 12, it is desirable, for the purpose of increasing the intensity of the press, to use a pair of driving levers and a pair of driven levers at each side of the press. As shown in the velocity distribution V of the pin shaft as the follower in Fig. 13, velocities at the press stroke are reduced extremely when compared with that of the crank press shown in Fig. 1 or with that of the toggle joint press shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, when the force multiplier is applied to the auto driven press, according to a proto type of the press, the total volume of the press having a capacity of 100 tons is as small as 1600 X 700 X llSO mm3 which is about one tenth of the volume of the conventional crank press mentioned above and the area for the installation of the present press is reduced to about one fifth of that of the conventional press. In Fig. 13, the same reference numerals as in Fig.12 are used to designate like parts. Further, it is to be noted that the distance between the height to which an input is applied and the height from which an output is obtained can be reduced to almost zero, since it is possible to minimize the distance between the upper surface of the bed 56 and the axis of the circular disk 49. This assures a high rigidity of the press and also a high working accuracy. in a conventional crank press of capacity 100 tons, the distance between the upper surface of the bed and the axis of the crank shaft is very large, for example, about 1500mm, and therefore the rigidity of the frame is lowered and the working accuracy of the press is lowered. Although the circular disk 12, 26 or 49 itself is pivotably mounted on the frame as a pivot shaft in the embodiments mentioned above, other structures are possible. For instance, a driving lever 65 shown in Fig. i4 has a pivot shaft 66 supported rotatably on a frame 67 and the pivot shaft 66 has a projection 68 at one end thereof which is elongated outwardly in a radial direction of the pivot shaft 66. A groove 69 is provided on the projection 68 along the lengthwise direction thereof, in which a follower 70 is engaged slidably. Also, a variety of the guide means known to those skilled in the art are employable as the guide means according to the present invention other than the groove 16, 52 or slot 31 disclosed above. It should also be appreciated that the foregoing is a description of example embodiments of the present invention, and that various other changes and modifications may be made.
