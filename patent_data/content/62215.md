# Seat belt retractor with reduced spooling.

## Abstract
A seat belt retractor 10 including a web clamp 26 in the retractor housing to reduce the spooling effect when the retractor 10 is locked. The webbing 22 extends from the retractor spool 20 about a web clamp 26 and then outwards of the retractor housing. Extraction forces acting on the webbing 22 in an emergency result in forcing of the web clamp 26 against the roll 72 of webbing to thereby prevent further withdrawal of the webbing 26 from the spool 20 . The web clamp 26 is maintained in close proximity to the roll 72 of webbing regardless of the amount of webbing 20 left on the spool 20 .
