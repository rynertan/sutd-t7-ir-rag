# Machine tool with bore diameter measuring apparatus and tool position compensating apparatus.

## Abstract
A machine tool comprises a tool holder 13 supporting a boring tool 26 and receivable in a tool spindle 12 . A device is provided in the tool holder 13 for adjusting a radial position of the boring tool 26 by utilizing rotation of the tool spindle 12 . A contact detecting head 23 with a known diameter a is secured to the tool holder 12 in co axial relationship therewith. A contact detecting device detects the contact between a workpiece bore W1 and the contact detecting head 23 . A bore diameter measuring device measures a diameter of the workpiece bore W1 by causing relative movement between the contact detecting head 23 and the workpiece from one position to another position, at each of which the contact detecting head 23 contacts the workpiece, along a path passing through the center of the workpiece bore W1 . The tool spindle 12 is rotated in response to the measuring device to adjust the radial position of the boring tool 26 .
