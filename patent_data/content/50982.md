## Description
Polymer Compositions This invention relates to polymer compositions containing major amounts say at least one third of total polymer content of homopolymers and or copolymers of vinyl chloride, all hereinafter called PVC compounds for brevity. PVC compounds frequently contain a plasticiser and a stabiliser, and in most cases a filler, and when these are suitably chosen the compounds have excellent.physical, chemical and electrical properties and are widely used for the insulation and or sheathing of electric wires and cables also for example floor and wall coverings, upholstery fabrics, tapes, film, belting, extruded profiles, hose and as mouldings, coatings often applied in plastisol form etc. The significant chlorine content of PVC gives compositions based on it a degree of flame retardance, but the results achieved vary with the formulation and are particularly sensitive to the type and amount of plasticiser usually the most flammable major ingredient even compositions specially formulated for high oxygen index will burn, and or will decompose to liberate vapours that burn, if exposed to a sufficiently high temperature, for example by a fire breaking out in a building in which products containing the compositions are installed. en this happens dense smoke is liable to be generated and in a situation where the amount of the polymer composition present is large, this may significantly increase the danger of the fire by obscuring its location and or hampering both escape and fire fighting. In recent years, a number of additives that have a broad, if not universal, tendency to reduce smoke generation when added to such polymer compositions have been discovered, but further improvement is desirable.Such an additive is hereinafter called a smoke suppressant which expression, for the avoidance of uncertainty, is hereby defined as a substance which, when added in a small amount to the other ingredients of the specific polymer composition being ref erred to, reduces the amount of smoke generated on burning under at least some conditions. Some smoke suppressants can be regarded as constituting a filler also. We have now discovered that the effect of known smoke suppressants can be enhanced to a surprising extent by using a plasticiser or more than one plasticiser of a particular kind. In accordance with the invention, a polymer composition comprises polymeric material of which at least one third is constituted by a homopolymer or copolyme of vinyl chloride,10 100 parts per hundred parts of total polymeric material of plasticiser, being at least 30 of the total plasticiser present, selected from the organic esters of formula EMI3.1 in which R1 is selected from the lower meaning up to C20 alkylgroups R2is selected from H, the lower alkyl and lower acylgroups and R3 and R4are independently selected from OH, lower alkoxy groups, and lower acyloxy groups, provided that not more than one of R2, R3 and R4 is included among H, OH and lower alkyl, such groups in every case optionally having one or more than one substituent selected from lower alkyl groups, lower acyl groups and lower acyloxy groups and effective amounts of at least one stabiliser and at least one smoke suppressant. Parts herein are by Preferred copolymers of vinyl chloride are those including graft copolymers in which the copolymerisable monomer is ethylene, propylene, vinylidene chloride, acrylic and methacrylic acids and their esters, and vinyl acetate. The compositions need not contain any other polymer1 but when there is another polymer present it may be any that is compatible with the other ingredients in particular it may be a chlorine containing polymer or it may be a polymer not containing chlorine. An exampleis a copolymer of ethylene with 5 60 vinyl acetate EVA . More than one plasticiser may be used,though the total plasticiser content should not normally exceed 100 parts in the case of flexible PVC compounds at least one must be a primary plasticiser, but one or more may be a secondary plasticiser sometimes called an extender that would not be effective as a plasticiser in the absence of the other plasticiser or plasticisers the plasticiser defined above as a characteristic of the invention may be either primary or secondary .Preferably, however, a single plasticiser, or more than one plasticiser selected from the group defined, is used.One preferred group of plasticisers has the formulaEMI4.1 in which R5 and R6 are selected from the same groups asR3 and R4, and R7 fran the same groups as R1, all listed above, provided that no more than two of R3, R4 R5, and R6 is included among H, OH and lower alkyl.More specifically we prefer plasticisers of either of the formulae specified in which R1 and R7 if present are unsubstituted alkyl groups R2 if present is an unsubstituted acyl group, and R3, R4, R5 and R6 to the extent present are unsubstituted acyloxy groups.Preferably all the R groups have at least 3 carbon atoms. Most preferred are the fatty acid hexa esters of dipentaerythritoland in particular the mixed butyratecaprylate hexa esters commercially available under the trademarks Bisoflex OBC and Hercoflex707, and the corresponding esters of pentaerythritol. For most of the plasticisers, and most of the applications, contemplated, the total plasticiser content will bein the range 30 90 parts per hundred parts of total polymer. The stabiliser may be conventional and does not require description, naturally the amount required will depend upon the type selected and upon the end use. The benefits of the invention appear to be obtained with all known classes of smoke suppressant additives but more especially with those that affect pyrolytic mechanisms. in the condensed phase rather than combustion processes in the flame zone. At present we prefer to select from i Smoke suppressant molybdenum compounds especiall.y but not exclusively3 a of a kind described by F. W. Moore in a paper entitled Advances in the Use of Molybdenum Additives as SmokeSuppressants for PVC and Results of Mechanism Studies presented at the Polymer Conference in Detroit, Michigan,.USA on 24th May, 1977 see also US Patent 3870679 , for example molybdic oxide b the proprietary materials sold under the trade markKemgard as Kemgard 911A and Kemgard 911C, which are believed to be of the kind described and claimed in BritishPatent 1551472, and c ammonium dodecaphosphomolybdate. ii metal oxide solid solutions of the kinds described in British Patent 1521531 and British PatentApplication 2032908A, for example the product sold as Ongard II which is believed to be a solid solution of.the oxides of zinc, magnesium and calcium. iii metal salts of the kind described in BritishPatent 1490233, for example the commercial hydrated zinc borate sold under the designations ZB 2335 andFirebrakeZB. iv magnesium compounds, especially the hydroxide basic carbonate and carbonate and the proprietary compound sold under the designation Reomol DV243 . These smoke suppressants can be used at customary levels. Naturally these vary from material to material, but in most cases in the range 0.01 70 parts per hundred total polymer or more in the case of smoke suppressants that are also fillers . 0.1 20 Parts and more especially 2 10 can considered a preferred range. be In most cases the polymer compositions df the invention will include at least one filler a wide range may be used but setting aside the smoke suppressant fillers already discussed we prefer to use fillers that enhance flame retardance and or inhibit emission of hydrogen chloride on combustion.More particularly, we prefer to use one or more of alumina trihydrate calcium carbonate dolomite especially in grades of small particle size of the order of 0.1 micrometres and below for the carbonates when acidbinding properties are desired, and in other cases 10 micrometres or below . When a high degree of resistance to flame propagation is desired, preferably the compositions also include a flame retardant additive, preferably antimony trioxide. Among other ingredients that may be included if desired are lubricants, e.g. calcium stearate , crosslinking agents, crosslinking promoters, radiation sensitisers, colourants, antioxidants, U.V.stabilisers, blowing agents, and anti static agents, all in customary amounts. In appropriate cases the compositions can be cross linked by electron or gamma radiation, or by other known techniques. The invention is illustrated by the following tabulated examples including comparison examples, indicated by letters to distinguish them immediately from numbered examples of the invention . In all the examples, the polymer composition comprises 100 parts of the same suspension grade vinyl chloride homopolymer of K value 71 calculated from relative viscosity data obtained by the method in ISO R 174 , 50 parts of the filler specified, 8 parts of a proprietary stabiliser paste of which 2 parts is a conventional plasticiser , 50 parts total plasticiser excluding that in the stabiliser paste , 1 part calcium stearate lubricant and varying amounts or none of smoke suppressant. The various formulations were compounded on a 2 roll mill and pressed at 160 degrees C into sheets of appropriate thickness. Samples, cut from a sheet 1.0 0.1 mm thick were tested for smoke generation according to ASTM E662 79 in the flaming mode using anN.B.S.smoke chamber supplied by American Instrument Co. Aminco results quoted as Dmcorr, the maximum specific optical density measured and corrected for smoke deposition on the optical detection system and as percentage transmittance . Samples cut from a sheet 3 mm thick were tested for oxygen index according to BS2782 Part 1 1978,Method 141D results as oxygen .

Dmcorr was increased only to 230 transmittance 1.8 and an oxygen index of 29.3 was achieved.In a similar example Example S using DOP, the value of Dmcorr was 360 transmittance 0.18 , which is higher than in Example A with the same plasticiser and filler and no smoke suppressant nor antimony trioxide. Table 7 illustrates modifications to the formulation ofExample 1 by replacing part of the OBC with an equal weight of DOP, and shows that a worthwhile advantage can be obtained at reduced cost using the plasticisers defined in combination with a conventional plasticiser.
