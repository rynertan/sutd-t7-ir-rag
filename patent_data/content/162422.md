As shown in the above table, MG325 CF7 and Strepto myces zaomyceticus have practically the same properties, except for the utilization of li arabinose, showing that both are very similar species. Accordingly, MG325 CF7 was identified as Streptomyces zaomyceticus MG325 CF7. The process for producing foroxymithine according to the present invention will be described in detail below. The cultivation of foroxymithine producing microorganisms in the process of this invention is carried out using nutritional sources. They may be any known nutritional sources which can be utilized by ordinary microorganisms. For example, commercially available fats and oils and carbohydrates, such as glycerol, glucose, lactose, starch and molasses are useful as carbon sources.Examples of nitrogen sources are peptone, meat extract, corn steep liquor, cotton seed meal, peanut meal, soybean meal, corn gluten meal, fish meal, yeast extract, N Z amine, casein, sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulfate. Sodium chloride, photphates, calcium carbonate, and magnesium sulfate can be used as inorganic nutrients. Particularly preferred culture media contain carbon sources such as glycerol and nitrogen sources such as cotton and seed meal. It is preffered to use culture media containing 1.5 glycerol, 1.5 cation seed meal, 0.3 sodium chloride, and 0.2 li asparagine monohydrate. To mass produce foroxymithine, liquid culture is preferred. The cultivation temperature may be any temperature at which the foroxymithine producing microorganism is grown to produce foroxymithine. The preferred temperature is 25 to 35 C. The cultivation is continued usually until this substance is produced and accumulated in sufficient amounts in the culture broth. If the foroxymithine producing Streptomyces nitrosporeus MG329 CP56 FERM P No. 7244 was used as the starting organism, the production process was carried out as follows A 500 ml Sakaguchi flask was charged with 120 ml of culture medium adjusted to pH 7.4 containing 1.5 glycerol, 1.5 cotton seed meal, 0.3 sodium chloride and O.24 L asparagine monohydrate. The culture medium was sterilized, and inoculated with a loopful of a slant culture of the foroxymithine producing strain Streptomyces nitrosporeus MG329 CF56 PERM P No. 7244 .The inoculum was shake cultured aerobically at 27 C. The accumulation of foroxymithine was recognized after 48 to 192 hours of culture. Foroxymithine can be produced satisfactorily by Jar fermentation as in the case of shake culture. For example, 15 liters oi a culture medium was placed in a 30 liter fermenter, and sterilized. 0.5 liter of a precultured seed culture broth was inoculated to the culture medium, and the inoculated medium was stirred at 27 C at 200 rpm under aeration with 15 liters of sterile air per minute. Under these conditions, the production of foroxymithine peaked in 68 hours. Follow up of foroxymithine during the cultivation step and the purification step was performed in accordance with the determination of anti angiotensin I converting enzyme activity by the method to be described below. Anti angiotensin I converting enzyme activity was determined by a modification of the angiotensin I converting enzyme determination technique described in M. Hayakari et al., Analytical Biochemistry Vol. 84, pages 361 369 1978 . Hippuryl L histidyl L leucine as a substrate was dissolved at a concentration of 5 mg ml inTris hydrochloride buffer 0.5M, pH 8.0 containing 0.3M sodium chloride. 0.40 ml of a solution containing a test material was added to 0.05 ml of the resulting solution. The mixture was heated at 57 C for 3 minutes. Then, 0.05 ml of a solution containing angiotensin I converting enzyme that had been obtained from a bovine lung and partially purified was added, and the mixture was reacted for 30 minutes at 37C. 0.03 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide was added to the system to terminate the reaction, and 2 ml of 0.06M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.2 was added after 15 minutes. Then, 2 ml of a methyl cellosolve solution of 1 cyanuric chloride was added for color reaction.After the system was allowed to stand for 15 minutes at room temperature, its absorbance termed absorbance a at 382 nm was measure. Separately, a mixed solution containing no test material was prepared similarly, and reaction similarly. The reaction system as the control was measured for absorbance, which was termed absorbance b .The angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition rate was calculated from the equation b a b x 100. Pure foroxymithine dihydrate at a concentration of 7 pg ml inhibited angiotensin I converting enzyme by 50 IC50 7 Wg ml Next, foroxymithine present in the filtrate of the cultured broth of the foroxymithine producing organism ara in the bacterial cells is recovered from them. Adsorption of this substance from the culture filtrate onto an adsorbent, followed by elution, can give this substance in a good yield. Activated carbon, ion exchange resins, etc. can be used as adsorbents. For instance, foroxymithine is adsorbed to activated carbon, and eluted with a 50 aqueous solution of acetone.In detail, to the culture filtrate is added 2 by weight, based thereon, of activated carbon, and the mixture is stirred. After washing with water, the system is eluted with a aqueous solution of acetone in an amount of a quarter of the volume of the culture filtrate, thereby to obtain an active fraction. Concentration under reduced pressure gives a crude concentrate of foroxymithine. The crude concentrate is diluted with water, and adsorbed to a column of DEAE SephadexC A 25 0E type packed to 1 60 of the volume of the culture filtrate. After washing with water, the column is eluted with a 0.1M aqueous solution of sodium chloride. After neutralization with hydrochloric acid, the eluate is concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain a crude powder of foroxymithine. Reversed phase high performance liquid chromatogra phy is useful for its purification. Chromatography on Nucleo 5C18 a product of Macherey Nagel is parti cularly effective. The chromatographic column is eluted with methanol 0.4 acetic acid 10 90 to yield pure form of foroxymithins. The biological activities of foroxymithine in accordance with this invention were studied in terms of its pharmacological actions. The studies shoved this substance to have an antihypertensive effect. This effect will be described with reference to the following ExperimentalExample.Experimental Example This Example illustrates the effect of foroxymithine on blood pressure in spontaneous hypertensive rats SR rats . SR rats weighing 320 to 358 g were orally admintste red foroxymithine dihydrate as an aqueous solution at doses of t2.5, 25 and 50 mg kg. After the administration, blood pressure was measured at certain time intervals.Changes in blood pressure in the foroxymithineadministered group were compared with those in the control group orally administered distilled water only.

Poroxymithine obtained by this invention is thus useful a. an antihypertensive agent. Acute toxicity studies in mice showed foroxymithine dihydrate, 800 mg kg i.v., to cause no deaths. Foroxy mithine is therefore a low toxicity substance. Accordingly, a third gist of this invention lies in providing an antihypertensive agent containing as its active principle the substance foroxymithine. Antibypertensive agents in accordance with this invention can be prepared by blending foroxymithine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters with customarily used carriers. Various chemotherapeutic agents may be further incorporated into the resulting products. Examples of the salts of foroxymithine are salts formed between the hydroxam group of foroxymithine and pharmaceutically acceptable cations, such as alkali metal ions, alkaline earth metal ions and other suitable metal ions. The esters of foroxymithine include, for example esters formed between the hydroxyl group of foroxymithine and organic acids such as formic acid and acetic acid or other suitable acids. The compounds or pharmaceuticals in accordance with this invention may be administered as oral preparations, injections or rectal suppositories.
