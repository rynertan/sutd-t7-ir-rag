# Rock drill bit.

## Abstract
A rock drill bit of the impact type comprising a boring head 11 , a shaft 12 having ridges 18 , a front surface 13 and a number of peripherally spaced holes receiving inserts 14 , said holes extending forwardly and outwardly at an acute angle with respect to the center line CL‚ÇÅ of the drill bit 10 . The guiding surface 25 of the insert 14 mainly coincides with the jacket surface 16 of the bit body 10 when the insert 14 has been fixed in the hole which emerges into both the jacket surface 16 and the front surface 13 of the bit body 10 . This means that the guiding surface 25 partly extends on both sides of the plane of the front surface 13 .
