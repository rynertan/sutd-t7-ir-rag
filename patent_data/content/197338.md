# Quaternary compounds for delayed action enhanced curing catalysis in polyurethane systems.

## Abstract
A method for preparing polyurethane product by the reaction of an organic polyisocyanate with a polyester or polyether polyol in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of a catalyst system consisting essentially of a tertiary amine and 1 to 35 wt , based on the tertiary amine, of an N hydroxyalkyl quaternary ammonium carbonylate salt, particularly a quaternary triethylenediamine compound. The use of such catalyst system advantageously improves the cure time of the urethane reaction, when compared to a system containing solely a tertiary amine, while maintaining the same initiation of the reaction. This advantage can be transferred to a delay in the initiation time while maintaining or shortening the cure time by adjustments in the total amount of the catalyst system used.

## Description
This application is a continuation in part of application Serial No. 06 670,705 filed 13 November 1984 and assigned to the assignee of the present application. This invention relates to the tertiary amine catalysis of reactions involving organic polyisocyanates and polyols in the production of polyurethane products. In the polyurethane industry there is a need for a delayed action catalyst, i.e. a catalyst that will delay the onset of the isocyanate polyol reaction initiation time while not substantially affecting the time to the end of the reaction or final cure, or that will yield the same initiation time with a shorter cure time. The problem is manifested in the production of polyurethane shoe soles where it would be desirable if the polyurethane forming composition would not begin to react until it has essentially filled the mold form while also reaching a final cured state in substantially the same or shorter time period to maintain productivity. Past attempts to solve this problem have centered around taking the standard amine catalyst, i.e. triethylenediamine, also known as diazabicyclo octane, and blocking it with an acid to form the simple amine salt. In theory, this approach should work well but from experimentation it failed to delay the initiation time as desired without lengthening the cure time. U.S. 4,040,992 discloses the polymerization and condensation reactions of organic isocyanates are catalytically promoted by the use of N hydroxyalkyl quaternary ammonium carbonylate salts, for example, N hydroxypropyl trimethyl ammonium salts of carboxylic acids such as those of formic and acetic acids and of fatty acids such as hexanoic and octanoic acids and the like. U.S. 3,010,963 discloses quaternary hydroxylalkyl bases and salts of triethylenediamine and imidazole. U.S. 3,892,687 discloses certain acyclic quaternary hydroxyalkyl ammonium alkoxides and phenoxides useful as catalysts for making polyurethane and polyurethane polyisocyanurate foams. U.S. 3,993,652 discloses phenoxides of certain cyclic quaternary ammonium bases containing a hydroxyalkyl group attached to the hetero nitrogen as catalysts in reactions involving organic isocyanates. U.S. 4,116,879 discloses the preparation of cellular polyurethane resins using as a catalyst certain quaternary hydroxyalkyl tertiary amine bases. The present invention provides a method for the preparation of a polyurethane product by the reaction of an organic polyisocyanate with a polyester or polyether polyol in the presence of a tertiary amine catalyst, the improvement which comprises employing as the catalyst system, in addition to the tertiary amine, about 1 to 35 wt based on the tertiary amine of a N,N bis hydroxyalkyl quaternary ammonium salt of triethylenediamine TEDA prepared by reacting greater than one mole, preferably about 1.3 to 3 moles of an alkylene oxide per mole of triethylenediamine in the presence of an acid H A, including inorganic and organic acids. The quaternary compound produced by the use of an alkylene oxide in excess of equimolar amounts with triethylenediamine is believed to have the following formula I Such quaternary compounds are another embodiment of the invention and are useful by themselves as catalysts for the reaction of an organic isocyanate with an active hydrogen containing compound, particularly polyisocyanates and polyols. The tertiary amine compounds to which a minor amount of quaternary ammonium salt of TEDA is added according to the invention are those tertiary amines typically used in the art for the preparation of polyurethane products. As an advantage of the invention, the catalyst systems, when used in the reaction of organic polyisocyanate compounds with polyether or polyester polyols, provide a decrease in cure time while maintaining substantially the same initiation time when the catalyst system is used at about the same level as the tertiary amine by itself in the polyurethane reaction. A further advantage is an increase in the initiation time while maintaining substantially the same cure, or demold, time at total catalyst levels which are lower than that for the tertiary amine alone. The method for preparing polyurethane product according to the invention involves the use of a particular catalyst system which consists essentially of a tertiary amine which catalyzes the isocyanate polyol reaction and 1 to 35 wt , preferably 3 to 25 wt , based on tertiary amine, of a N,N bis hydroxyalkyl quaternary ammonium mono salt of triethylenediamine prepared by reacting triethylenediamine with excess alkylene oxide, especially about 30 to 200 excess alkylene oxide, on a molar basis, the reaction is performed in the presence, preferably of an equimolar amount, of an acid, preferably organic acid, or such acid may be added subsequently, to afford the carbonylate salt. Exemplary of the tertiary amines which can be used in the catalyst composition are those amines having the following general formula II In addition to the heterocyclic amines just mentioned, other suitable tertiary amines include trimethylamine, dimethylethylamine, N dimethyl N hydroxyethylamine, N benzyl N dimethylamine, N di hydroxyethyl N phenylamine, triethanolamine, N cyclohexyl N dimethylamine, and bis dimethylaminoethyl ether. The preferred tertiary amines are triethylenediamine TEDA , especially when the catalyst system is used in a polyurethane shoe sole formulation, and dimethylethanolamine DMEA combined with bis dimethylaminoethyl ether BDMAEE in a ratio of 5 8 parts DMEA per part of BDMAEE, especially a ratio of 6 7 1, when the catalyst system is used in a rigid appliance polyurethane foam system. The preferred route for the preparation of the N,N bis hydroxy alkyl quaternary triethylenediamine monocarbonylate salts used in the invention is by reaction of triethylenediamine with from about 30 to 200 molar excess of an alkylene oxide, desirably about 100 molar excess, in the presence of the chosen acid, especially an organic carboxylic acid. In other words one mole of triethylenediamine is reacted with about 1.3 to 3 moles, desirably about 2 moles, of alkylene oxide. If the corresponding quaternary compound is available as the hydroxide or alkoxide, formation of the desired carbonylate can be directly obtained by reaction of such quaternary ammonium base with the desired acid. Preparation of hydroxyalkyl quaternary ammonium carbonylates is more fully described in U.S. 4,040,992 which is incorporated by reference. Contemplated as the functional equivalent for triethylenediamine for purposes of this invention is methyl triethylenediamine. The alkylene oxides that can be reacted with triethylenediamine can be represented by general formula III Among the particular alkylene oxides that can be reacted with the triethylenediamine there are included ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, styrene oxide, glycidol and longer chain alkylene oxides. Ethylene oxide and especially propylene oxide are preferred. It is preferred that any one of a large variety of organic acids represented by general formula IV may be used to furnish the anion of the desired quaternary salt of triethylenediamine. The preferred quaternary ammonium carbonylate salts for use in the catalyst system are those in which the acid is an organic carboxylic acid corresponding to the following general formula R₈ CO₂H where R₈ is hydrogen, an alkyl group of 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group of 2 to 15 carbon atoms, benzyl or CH₂CN. Organic carboxylic acids of the above formula IV include short to long chain fatty acids substituted aliphatic acids and aromatic carboxylic acids. Representative acids include formic, acetic, hexanoic, straight and branched chain heptanoic, octanoic, decanoic and hexadecanoic acids neoacids such as 3,3 dimethyl butanoic acid unsaturated aliphatic acids such as oleic, acrylic, methacrylic, undecenoic aromatic acids such as benzoic, phenyl acetic and salicylic and cyanoacetic and chloroacetic acids. Hydroxypropylated triethylenediamine quaternary salts of formic acid and carboxylic acids having up to about 10 carbon atoms such as those of 2 ethylhexanoic and various decanoic acids are preferred. In the usual method of preparation triethylenediamine, a carboxylic acid and an alkylene oxide are mixed, preferably in the presence of a suitable solvent such as dipropylene glycol, ethylene glycol or 1,4 butanediol. The alkylene oxide is used in excess of equimolar amounts with triethylenediamine, desirably in amounts ranging from 30 to about 200 excess on a molar basis, especially about a 100 molar excess. The reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of 25 60 C and at about atmospheric pressure, although higher pressures may be employed, if desired. Such preparative method is believed to afford a novel quaternary compound of the following formula V The alkylene oxide and triethylenediamine should be reacted in the presence of no more than an equimolar amount of acid, based on triethylenediamine, preferably an equimolar amount. Greater amounts of acid form the disalt which is less active catalytically. Where about two moles 100 molar excess of alkylene oxide are reacted per mole of triethylenediamine the product should be substantially that depicted by formula V. Alkylene oxide above such amount most likely adds to the anionic alkyleneoxy group on the quaternary compound. Using less than 2 moles of alkylene oxide per mole triethylenediamine would yield the above quaternary compound of formula V in a mixture with a quaternary compound of the following formula VI A catalytically effective amount of the catalyst system of the invention is used in the polyurethane formulation comprising polyisocyanate, polyether or polyester polyol, water or other suitable blowing agent, and cell stabilizers such as silicone surfactants. More specifically, suitable amounts of the catalyst system may range from about 0.1 to 3 parts per 100 parts polyol in the polyurethane formulations. Examples of suitable polyisocyanates are hexamethylene, diisocyanate, phenylene diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate, and 4,4 diphenyl methane diisocyanate. Especially suitable are the 2,4 and 2,6 toluene diisocyanates individually or together as their commercially available mixtures. Other suitable mixtures of diisocyanates are those known commercially as crude MDI , also known as PAPI, which contain about 60 of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate along with other isomeric and analogous higher polyisocyanates. Also suitable are prepolymers of these polyisocyanates comprising a partially pre reacted mixture of polyisocyanates and polyether or polyester polyol. Illustrative of suitable polyols as a component of the polyurethane formulations catalyzed by the catalyst systems of the invention are the polyalkylene ether and polyester polyols. The polyalkylene ether polyols include the poly alkylene oxide polymers such as poly ethylene oxide and poly propylene oxide polymers and copolymers with terminal hydroxyl groups derived from polyhydric compounds including diols and triols for example, among others, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3 butane diol, 1,4 butane diol, 1,6 hexane diol, neopentyl glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, pentaerythritol, glycerol, diglycerol, trimethylol propane, cyclohexane diol and like low molecular weight polyols. Useful polyester polyols include those produced by reacting a dicarboxylic acid with an excess of a diol for example, adipic acid with ethylene glycol or butanediol, or reacting a lactone with an excess of a diol such as caprolactone and propylene glycol. Other typical agents found in the polyurethane formulations include blowing agents such as water, methylene chloride, trichlorofluoromethane and the like, and cell stabilizers such as silicones. A general polyurethane formulation containing the N,N bis hydroxalkyl triethylenediamine quarternary salt TEDA QUAT suitable for shoe soles would comprise one of the following The following general procedure for the preparation of the carboxylic acid salt of N,N bis 2 hydroxypropyl triethylenediamine quaternary amine was essentially as taught in U.S. 4,040,992 except that greater than an equimolar quantity of alkylene oxide was used. The other quaternary ammonium salts in the following examples were similarly prepared except that alkylene oxide was not added in excess of equimolar amounts. A suitable amount of glycol solvent is charged to a reaction vessel equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, condenser and heating mantle. One mole of the appropriate carboxylic acid 144g for 2 ethyl hexanoic acid is added. The reaction vessel is surrounded with a cooling bath about 15 C and one mole of the amine 112g triethylenediamine is added. The reaction temperature is allowed to reach 25 C whereupon greater than one mole of alkylene oxide 58g propylene oxide is added to the reaction mixture. The catalyst composition according to the invention requires from greater than 0 to about 200 molar excess of the alkylene oxide be added to the reaction medium. Although the reaction is exothermic, it may be controlled by the slow addition of the alkylene oxide. After all the alkylene oxide has been added, the reaction temperature is maintained at about 40 C for a period of time, preferably about 30 minutes. In Examples 2 6 the triethylenediamine quaternary compound was prepared using an equimolar amount of propylene oxide. Example 7 shows the surprisingly greater activity of the quaternary compound prepared using greater than equimolar amounts of propylene oxide, i.e. reaction product contains a N,N bishydroxypropylated quaternary compound. A polyester polyol urethane shoe sole composition was prepared of the following ingredients in which various catalyst systems were used The catalyst system was mixed with the other components and the mixture stirred rapidly with a laboratory stirrer for 5 seconds, and the initiation time and pinch time were recorded. All times commenced when mixing began. The initiation time was visually observed as the moment the mixture began to rise. The cure was measured by recording the pinch time. This was determined by pinching a small piece of the risen polyurethane and vigorously pulling. Until the system had developed sufficient cure, the pinched piece tore away. When the cure was sufficiently developed, the pinched piece did not tear away and the system maintained its structural integrity. This time, directly indicative of cure, was recorded as the pinch time. The data is summarized in Table 1. From Table 1 can be see that Run 1 using triethylenediamine TEDA as the sole amine catalyst in this control example showed an initiation time of 13 seconds and a pinch time of 68 seconds. Runs 2 and 3 which used the 2 ethyl hexanoate and formic acid salts of TEDA, respectively, showed no advantage in initiation time or pinch time in Run 2 and a delay in both initiation and pinch times in Run 3. In Runs 8 15 some of the TEDA was replaced by minor amounts of the cyanoacetic acid and 2 ethyl hexanoic acid salts of triethylenediamine N 2 hydroxypropyl quaternary amine and of dimethyl N hydroxyethyl N 2 hydroxypropyl quaternary amine. In each instance the initiation time was significantly delayed while the pinch time remained substantially the same as the control. In Runs 16 28 a polyether polyol urethane shoe sole composition containing various amine catalysts was prepared of the following ingredients The appropriate data is summarized in Table 2. Compared to the control Run 16 using TEDA as the sole amine catalyst Runs 17 and 21 23 using the oxalic acid salt of TEDA and blends of TEDA with other tertiary amines, respectively, showed a decrease in the initiation time and a delay in pinch time. This is the complete opposite of what is desired. Runs 24 26 according to the invention showed that a decreased amount of TEDA in combination with a minor amount of the indicated quaternary ammonium salt provided a significant delay in initiation time with no experimentally significant delay in pinch time in Runs 25 and 26. This example shows the advantage of a significant decrease in pinch time while maintaining initiation time when using a catalyst system according to the invention in another typical polyester shoe sole formulation. The data in Table 3 shows the effect of matching the initiation time of the control catalyst Run 29 and substantially reducing the cure time as measured by pinch time by the use of a minor amount of quaternary ammonium salt with the tertiary amine, about 10 20 wt based on tertiary amine, specifically about 16 wt in Run 30. This example demonstrates the ability to achieve both a substantially delayed initiation time and substantially faster cure time. The general formulation employed was the following From Table 4 it can be seen that the control system of Run 31 was substantially improved by the addition of small amounts of a quaternary ammonium salt in Runs 32 and 33 which employed a catalyst blend of TEDA and between 16 22 wt of the quaternary ammonium salt, based on TEDA. In both cases the initiation time was extended, by 44 and 67 respectively, while the pinch time was shortened by 26 and 43 , respectively. In Run 34 the pinch time was decreased by 68 while achieving a delay in initiation of 10 . In subsequent experiments involving other polyester and polyether shoe sole systems, it was determined that an amount of propylene oxide in excess of equimolar with the tertiary amine i.e., about 100 excess, in the manufacture of the TEDA quarternary salt yielded the best reactivity results. This example shows the application of the invention to a typical rigid appliance polyurethane foam formulation. The catalyst system was mixed with the other components and stirred for about 5 seconds, then discharged into a container of ample size. All times commenced with the beginning of the mixing. The initiation time was visually observed as the moment the mixture began to rise. The top of the rising foam was constantly tapped with the edge of a tongue depressor. The string gel time was recorded as the first time that strings formed between the foam and the tongue depressor. The tack free time was that time at which no foam stuck to a second tongue depressor. Runs 36 39 of Table 4 show the decrease in gel time of a rigid appliance urethane composition using as the catalyst trimethyl N 2 hydroxypropyl ammonium 2 ethylhexanoate and dimethyl N hydroxyethyl N 2 hydroxypropyl ammonium formate. Runs 40, 41 and 43 show shorter tack free time while Runs 40 42 show the same or slightly longer initiation time. This example shows the unexpected advantage in the use of a triethylenediamine quaternary 2 ethylhexanoate salt prepared using excess propylene oxide. Equimolar amounts of triethylenediamine and 2 ethylhexanoic acid were reacted with varying molar excess amounts of propylene oxide. The general formulation employed was the following It can be seen that Runs 47 50 which employed a catalyst system comprising triethylenediamine quaternary salt prepared using one or two molar excess propylene oxide in combination with free triethylenediamine afforded a significant delay in initiation while maintaining or decreasing the pinch time and significantly decreasing the bounce time when compared to triethylenediamine by itself or in combination with the quaternary salt prepared with 10 excess propylene oxide. The method of the invention provides delayed action enhanced cure catalyst systems for polyurethane compositions that can delay the initiation time of the urethane reaction while maintaining the cure time, or maintain the initiation time while decreasing the cure time, or both, by varying the amount of the catalyst system used.
