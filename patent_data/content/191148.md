# PURIFICATION OF MOLYBDENUM

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for removing potassium from relatively impure molybdenum trioxide. The process in volves contacting the impure molybdenum trioxide with a first acid leach consisting essentially of a first mineral acid and the ammonium salt of the first mineral acid at a suf ficient temperature, for a sufficient time and at a sufficient concentration of the first mineral acid in the first acid leach to solubilize the major portion of the potassium followed by separation of the resulting once leached molybdenum triox ide from the resulting potassium containing first acid leach. The once leached molybdenum trioxide is then contacted with a second acid leach which consists essentially of a second mineral acid and the ammonium salt of the second mineral acid at essentially the same conditions as in the first leach to remove the remaining portion of the potassium from the molybdenum trioxide. The resulting twice leached molybdenum trioxide is then separated from the potassium containing second acid leach. The resulting twice leached molybdenum trioxide is then water washed and separated from the resulting wash water. Alternately, the first leached molybdenum trioxide is water washed and the resulting once leached washed molybdenum trioxide is separated from the resulting wash water prior to contacting with the second acid leach.
