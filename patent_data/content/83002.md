# INTERRUPT SYSTEM FOR PERIPHERAL CONTROLLER

## Abstract
An interrupt network whereby, upon completion of a data transfer cycle between a host computer and peripheral controller or completion of a data transfer cycle between a peripheral terminal and peripheral controller, the peripheral controller is placed in an interrupt mode background mode and institutes an interrupt service routine. The normal mode data in the peripheral controller is stored for re use upon return to normal mode.
