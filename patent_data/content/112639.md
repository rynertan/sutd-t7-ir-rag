# High resilience polyurethane foams having improved resistance to shrinkage.

## Abstract
High resilience polyurethane foam having improved open pore structure can be obtained by reacting an organic polyisocyanate and a polyol component in the presence of a blowing agent and a polyurethaneformation catalyst, when the polyol component comprises an ethylene oxide capped alkoxylated alkylenediamine adduct, wherein the alkylene diamine has from two to twelve carbon atoms. The open pore structure provides enhanced breathability .
