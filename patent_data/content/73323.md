# Encrypted data transmission in a TDMA satellite communications network.

## Abstract
An encryption system is disclosed which is based on channel destination addresses for a timedivision multiple access TDMA satellite communications network. A super frame initialization vector is transmitted from a master sta tion to all other stations in the network. A plurality of frame initialization vectors is sequentially generated at each sta tion in an encryption engine, from the superframe initializa tion vector, using a key which is common only to authorized users within the network. Each data channel is initialized with encryption bits produced by exclusive ORing the chan nel destination address and the frame initialization vector for the frame in which that channel is to be transmitted, and then passing the output of the exclusive OR through the encryption engine 400 using either the same key or a second, different key. These encryption bits are combined with the channel data 54 in an exclusive OR circuit 404 for TDMA transmission via the satellite transponder to the receiving stations. The decryption process at the receiving stations parallels the encryption process at the transmitting stations, so that clear text data is output only at the destina tion addressed where the intended recipient has the same key as the transmitter. The system enables the synchroniza tion of encryption engines at separate, geographically re mote stations and permits the decryption of encrypted chan nels at any time within a TDMA frame.
