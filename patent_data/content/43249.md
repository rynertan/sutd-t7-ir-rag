# Improvements in or relating to Stirling cycle machines.

## Abstract
A Stirling cycle machine in which the compressor expander 2 is in driving connection with a first electro magnetic unit 13 , and in which a second electromagnetic unit 17, 18,19 is connected to the displacer 1 and can be operated as an externally variable control of the movements of the displacer. In one form of the invention the second unit 17,18,19,35 acts as an electromagnetic damper upon move ments which the displacer makes in natural response to those of the compressor. In another form of the invention the second unit positively drives the displacer and the two units are interconnected by means including a phase shifting device 28 whereby movements of compressor and displac er are kept of equal frequency but variable as to phase difference. Transducers 46,47 sensitive to position, velocity or acceleration may improve control of the movements of compressor and displacer, and a temperature sensor 48 associated with the cold finger 8 of the displacer may further improve control of the movements of the latter.
