# ACRYLIC OR METHACRYLIC ACID COPOLYMERS AND IMPROVED AQUEOUS AUTO DEPOSITION COATING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THE SAME

## Abstract
The present invention deals with acrylic or methacrylic acid copolymers and improved autodeposition coating com position containing the same. The new acrylic polymer contains 1 20 of methacrylic acid or 1 12 of acrylic acid, with 75 99 of at least one vinylenically monounsaturated monomer and optionally a hydroxy containing monomer and a cross linker and it has a gloss transition temperature of from 2 to 50 C. This acrylic polymer, used under the form of a latex with water and a source of hydrogen ion, provides an aqueous autodeposition coating composition having improved gloss and corrosion, rinse, heat aging and gasoline resistance.
