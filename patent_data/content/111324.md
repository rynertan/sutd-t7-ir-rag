## Abstract
A method for preparing weft supply to be picked upon start of operation of a weaving loom, the weaving loom comprising a main motor 11 for driving the weaving loom, a crank shaft 13 driven by the main motor 11 , a drum 28 for measuring weft to be picked by a main air jet nozzle 49 , a driving system 20, 27 of the weft measuring drum 28 , and an auxiliary motor 36 for driving the weft measuring drum 28 , the method comprises releasing connection between the driving system 20, 27 of the weft measuring drum 28 and the main motor 11 for driving the weaving loom so as to enable the auxiliary motor 36 to drive the driving system 20, 27 of the weft measuring drum 28 positioning the weft measuring drum 28 by means of the auxiliary motor 36 at a position suitable for being threaded with the weft threading the weft onto the weft measuring drum 28 and driving the weft measuring drum 28 by the auxiliary motor 36 so as to store a predetermined amount of weft thereon.
