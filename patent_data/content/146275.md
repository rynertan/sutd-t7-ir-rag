# DATA SIGNAL SWITCHING SYSTEMS

## Abstract
To effect transfer of messages between data units 1 4, 5 8 a switching network of binary distributors 21 24, 31 38 and concentrators 41 48, 51 54 is used. For each distributor in the network the message is preceded by a respective single data bit which is absorbed in the switching system. Thus at the message destination all addressing bits have been absorbed, only the required message being received. Concentrators have both input paths enabled to their respective output paths except when a message is passing through the concentrator when the non transmitting path is disabled. Any message arriving at a blocked concentrator is lost. Accordingly an acknowledging system uses a reverse path set up in parallel with the forward path to acknowledge receipt of the message. Alternatively the reverse path may be used to return a message fail indication from a blocked concentrator.
