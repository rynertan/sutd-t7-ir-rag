# Isotropic liquid detergent compositions containing multicomponent active system.

## Abstract
Isotropic liquid detergent compositions containing ethoxylated nonionics and amine oxide surfactants, water soluble sequestering builders and a further hydrophilic surface active agent are disclosed. These compositions provide superior detergency over a wide range of condi tions including cold water detergency.
