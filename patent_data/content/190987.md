## Description
The invention relates to a new process for the production of β carbolines from the corresponding 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydro β carbolines by dehydrogenation. Processes for the production of β carbolines from 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro β carbolines have been known for a long time e.g., see GB PS 975,835 . According to the latter, dehydrogenation is carried out at an elevated temperature in the 140 150 C range in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide in the presence of selenium, sulfur or chloranil. Sulfur dimethylsulfoxide can also be succesfully used Heterocycles, 1983 20 , 1295 on EP A 110814 . However, these methods have the disadvantage that the yields leave much to be desired due to a relatively drastic treatment of the starting material and the subsequent separation of by products. It is an object of this invention to provide a process overcoming or ameliorating these disadvantages. Upon further study of the specification and appended claims, further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art. These objects have been achieved according to the invention by performing the dehydrogenation at a reaction temperature below ambient temperature in an inert solvent with tert butyl hypochlorite in the presence of a tertiary base. Thus, this invention relates to a process for the production of β carbolines of formula I wherein wherein R Reactions of nitrogen compounds with electrophilic reagents such as tertbutyl hypochlorite, are known, e.g., N chlorination J.S. Chalsty and S.S. Israelstam, Chem. and Ind. Alkyl radicals R of up to 5 C atoms can be both straight chained and branched. Methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl and tert butyl are typical examples, along with other butyls and the pentyls. R All of the compounds that can be produced by the process according to the invention are either themselves biologically effective or are valuable intermediate products for the production of biologically effective β carbolines, such as, e.g., 5 benzyloxy 4 methoxymethyl β carboline 3 carboxylic acid ethyl ester G. Neef et al., Heterocycles 1983 20 , 1295 or of 4 methoxy 5 benzyloxy 3 5 3 ethyl 1,2,4 oxadiazol yl carboline by saponification to the free 3 carboxylic acid, reaction with thionyl diimidazole and propionamidoxime and condensation under heat to the oxadiazolyl ring system in 3 position. See EP 00 54 507 USP 4,435,403, USP 4,371,536 and EP 00 30 254, which references are incorporated by reference herein. Non limiting examples of suitable inert solvents include, e.g., aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2 dichloroethane and ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diisopropyl ether and tert butylmethyl ether. 2 15 liter solvents are added pro 1 mol tetrahydro β carboline. The tert butyl hypochlorite is generally added in a quantity of 2.0 to 3.5, preferably about 3.0 mole equivalents relative to the amount of tetrahydro β carboline used. Typically, the amount of tertiary amine is in a molar ratio tert. base tert.butyl hypochlorite 1.5 2.5 1. Triethylamine is preferred. The reaction temperature for the dehydrogenation according to the invention is below ambient temperature i.e., less than about 25 C about 70 C being a typical lower limit. The 15 to 5 C range is preferred. Working under a protective gas, such as under a nitrogen atmosphere, is advantageous. The course of the reaction can be conventionally tracked by thin layer chromatography and typically is ended after 2 to 6 hours conventionally depending on the starting material and the other conditions. The dehydrogenation of tetrahydro β carbolines according to the invention is a The reaction mixture is worked up in the usual manner by filtration, distillation, crystallization and or chromatography. The starting materials are all known and or readily preparable from known materials using conventional processes, e.g., as described in the examples. 10 mmol of 5 benzyloxy 4 methoxymethyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro β carboline 3 carboxylic acid ethyl ester is dissolved in 45 ml of methylene chloride. The solution is cooled to 15 C and 4.6 ml of triethylamine is added. Then a solution of 3.6 ml of tert butyl hypochlorite in 45 ml of methylene chloride is added within about 10 minutes and stirred for 5 minutes more. After further addition of 3.8 ml of triethylamine, heating to ambient temperature and stirring at this temperature for 4 hours takes place. The solvent is distilled off in vacuum bath temperature 30 C and condensed to dryness at 60 C bath temperature.
