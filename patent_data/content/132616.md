# System for automatically calibrating the space coordinates of a robot gripper in six degrees of freedom.

## Abstract
A system for automatically calibrating a robot in all degrees of freedom in one point to compensate for inac curacies in the different coordinate directions. The system includes moving a measuring body 32 held by the robot gripper in response to a command representative of a previ ously determined nominal position within a measuring fixture 31 known to the robot controller, determining by means of sensing means S1 S6 the actual position reached by said measuring body, calculating the errors in the different coordi nate directions based on the measured values and the nomi nal position values and compensating for the errors in respec tive coordinate directions.
