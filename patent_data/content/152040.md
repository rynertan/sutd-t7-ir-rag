# SLIDE ACTION INSIDE CORNER FORM

## Abstract
A concrete form unit for casting an inside corner structure has a pair of form panels disposed generally perpendicular to each other and an elongated corner mem ber disposed between spaced adjoining edges of such panels with an actuator having relatively movable parts including a first part connected to the midsection of a yoke and a second part connected to the corner member. The ends of the yoke are guidingly connected to the form panels, respectively, and the adjoining edges of the form panels are guidingly coupled to opposite sides of the corner member by slidingly interengaging surfaces, these surfaces defining a tapered wedge where the corner member mates with the adjoining edges of the form panels.
