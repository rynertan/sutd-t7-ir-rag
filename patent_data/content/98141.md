## Description
DESCRIPTION PROSTAGLANDIN D ANALOGUES, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to new prostaglandin D analogues, to processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Prostaglandins are derivatives of prostanoic acid having the following structure EMI1.1 Various types of prostaglandirsare known, and their types depend on the structure of the alicyclic ring and the substituents. For example, the alicyclic rings of prostaglandins F PGF , E PGE and D PGD have the following structures, respectively EMI1.2 In the above structural formulae or in the other structural formulae in this specification, according to the generally accepted nomenclature, the dotted line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is behind the ring plane, i.e. is of the a configuration, the bold line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is in frortof the ring plane, i.e. is of the ss configuration, and the wavy line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is of the a configuration or the ss configuration or a mixture thereof. These compounds are sub classified according to the positions of the double bonds in the side chains attached to the alicyclic ring at the 8 position and the 12position. The PG l compound has a trans double bond trans h13 between C13 C14 and the PG 2 compound has a cis double bond between C5 C6 and a trans double bond between C13 C14 cis 5, trans 13 . For example, prostaglandin D1 PGD1 and prostaglandin D2 PGD2 may be expressed by the following structural formulae, respectively EMI2.1 and EMI3.1 Further, when one or more methylene groups are removed from the aliphatic group attached at the 12position of the alicyclic ring of a prostaglandin, said compound is known as a nor prostaglandin according to the general rule of the organic nomenclature, and the number of the removed methylene groups is indicated by adding di , tri etc. before the prefix nor . The prostaglandins generally have pharmacological properties. For example, they exert various effects, including the stimulation of contraction of smooth muscles, a hypotensive effect, a diuretic effect, a bronchial dilation effect, the inhibition of lypolysis, the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, they are useful in treatments of hypertension, thrombosis, asthma and gastric and intestinal ulcers, in the induction of labour and abortion in pregnant mammals, in the prevention of arteriosclerosis and also as diuretics. They are liposoluble substances present in extremely small quantities in the tissues which secrete prostaglandins in vivo in animals. As a result of research and experimentation to discover novel compounds which have the pharmacological effects of the natural prostaglandins, or which have one or more of these properties to an enhanced degree, or which have properties which are not found in the natural prostaglandins, it has been discovered that a certain novel PGD analogues in which the carboxyl group attached at the l position of PGD and PGD analogues is replaced by a glycoloyl group i.e. COCH20R group or by certain substituted or unsubstituted amide groups defined hereinafter, b further novel compounds in which the hydroxyl group attached at the 9 position of the compounds wherein the carboxyl group is replaced by the glycoloyl group, by the amide group or by an alkylsulfonylamide group as hereinafter defined, has been removed to introduce a cis double bond between C9 C10, and c further novel compounds in which the hydroxyl group attached at the 15 position of the compounds b has been removed to introduce double bonds between C12 Cl3 and between C14 C15 have a surprisingly strong anti tumour effect whereas they have no or only very weak pharmacological properties possessed by the natural prostaglandins. Heretofore, there have been filed several patent applications relating to PGD analogues. For example, concerning compounds in which the carboxylic acid moiety attached at the 1 position of PGD1 and PGD2 has been converted to other groupings, there are methanesulfonyl amide forms see United States Patent No. 4346228 Derwent No. 43349 3, alcohol forms see United StatesPatent Nos. 4028419 Derwent No. 43349Y , 4055602 DerwentNo. 48794Y and 4032576 Derwent No. 48793 , amine forms see British Patent Nos. 1554041 and 1554042 DerwentNo. 46957 and ketone forms see United States PatentNo. 4123463 Derwent No. 81996A .However, neither PGD compounds in which the carboxyl group is replaced by the glycoloyl group or an amide group as encompossed by the present invention nor the novel effect of the compounds of the present invention, i.e. their anti tumour effect has been described heretofore. The above mentioned patent specifications describe only the pharmacological properties known with the natural prostaglandins and none of the applications refers to an anti tumour effect. There have also been several patent applications relating to the derivatives in which the hydroxyl group at the 9 position has been dehydrated, which is a further structural feature in the compounds of the present invention 9 deoxy t99 derivatives . For example, among the above mentioned patent specifications, the corresponding 9 deoxy A9 derivatives are described in all the specifications except United States Patent No. 4346228 Derwent No. 81216X . However, there is no disclosure of the 9 deoxy t9 derivatives as encompassed by the present invention nor, as already indicated, any disclosure of anti tumor activity. PGD compounds in which the hydroxyl groups at the 9 position and the 15 position have been removed to introduce double bonds Cg ClO, C12 C13 and C14 C151 a further structural feature in the compounds of the present invention, have not hitherto been published.
