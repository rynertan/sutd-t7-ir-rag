## Description
ELECTRET FIBER SHEET AND METHOD OF PRODUCING SAME The present invention relates to an electret fiber sheet and a method of producing it. Known electrets are described in US A 3998916 andUS A 4215682. The former discloses a web formed from a fiber prepared by cutting an electret film, while the latter discloses a web prepared by forming an electret fiber during spinning and collecting the same on a conveyer. Both of these known electrets have random orientation of polarized charges in the sheet, since they are formed into a web by dispersing electret fibers with random direction of polarization. Thus the charges are mutually weakened or offset disadvantageously.Therefore, the electric field strength of such an eiectret is low, and the charges therein disadvantageously are weakened with the lapse of time. The present invention aims at providing an electret having an excellent stability which cannot be expected from conventional electrets and an ability to retain high charges over a long period of time. Aspects of the present invention are 1. An electret fiber sheet having polarized charges on the surfaces thereof, the or the maximum activation energy of depolarization of the sheet being at least 0.2 eV. 2. An electret fiber sheet having polarized charges on the surfaces thereof, and preferably an ordered orientation of charges across the thickness of the sheet, the total charge per unit area of the sheet 11 2 being at least 7 x 10 cam 3. A process for producing an electret fiber sheet comprising placing a fiber sheet between a noncontact voltage application electrode and an earth electrode confronting each other and applying voltage of at least 3kV cm at an electric current density of at least 10 6 mA cm2, preferably from 10 6 to 10 2 2 mA cm2 inclusive between both of said electrodes, the fiber sheet having a weight no more than 80 g m2 and a covering factor of at least 60 . By a non contact electrode, we mean any electrode which can be used to charge a sheet while leaving a gap between the electrode and the fiber sheet, at least some of which gap is occupied by a fluid medium such as air. A process in accordance with the invention for producing electret fiber sheeting may be carried out continuously. In such a case, the applied voltage and current density should be as high as possible because their effects will differ in dependence upon the positions of the various parts of the continuous sheet relative to the voltage source, especially where a large earth electrode such as a metallic roller or metallic conveyor belt is used. A supplemental material, which may be a solid block or sheet, or which may be a liquid, may be placed between the fiber sheet and the earth electrode, in which case the supplemental material should have a volume resistivity higher than that of the earth electrode and lower than that of the fiber sheet, say greater than 10 fl cm, preferably 10 1 to 1010 Q cm, more 8 to 106 6 preferably 101 to 10 n cm, especially 102 to 10 cm. The process of the invention allows the formation of an electret fiber sheet in which the charges are present deep within the interior of the sheet, are disposed in an ordered orientation across the thickness of the sheet and are retained by the sheet over a particularly long period of time so that the sheet has a particularly long life span. Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figs. 1 and 5 show what owe believe are possible patterns of distribution of polarized charges in a cross section of an electret fiber sheet embodying this invention though we are uncertain as to the charge distribution between the fabric surfaces .

Fig. 19 is a graph showing respective surface charge density values of individual fiber sheets of a laminate in relation to their respective positions in the laminate and relative to the positions of noncontact and earth electrodes used to polarize the laminate this graph shows the poor results achieved when polarizing a laminate of too high a total weight. In this specification, the phrase having charges on the surfaces thereof means having positive or negative charges on each surface thereof , as is the case in a common electret. Though the amount of such charges in the electret of this invention is not specifically limited, too small an amount of such charges presents a problem of performance. Thus the amount of polarized charges 11 2 kept in the fiber sheet is preferably 7 x 10 11 C cm2 10 2 or larger, more preferably 2 x 10 10 C cm2 or larger. In an electret fiber sheet according to one aspect of this invention at least the maximum activation energy of depolarization is at least 0.2 eV. The activation energy can be determined from a graph examples of which are illustrated in Fig.7 showing the amount of depolarization current generated by a temperature rise. The amount of the depolarization current indicates the depth of charges trapped, and has a great influence on the life span and durability of the electret. Using the equipment shown in Fig. 6, the measurement of depolarization current versus temperature can be made by strongly nipping an electret fiber sheet 2 2 cm diameter placed in a heating oven 6 including a temperature controller 5, connected with a high sensitivity ammeter 7. More specifically, as the temperature of the heating oven is raised at a constant rate, for example, at a rate of 50C min from room temperature to a temperature close to the melting point of the sheet, the charges trapped cause electric current due to depolarization thereof. The electric current is recorded by a recorder 9 operated by a data processing unit 8 to obtain a curve of electric current against temperature in various temperature zones Fig. 7 .The polarized charge per unit area is the quotient of the area under the current curve divided by the area of the specimen subjected to the measurement. In the rising portion of each peak in the chart, the following equation is satisfied. Thus the activation energy for the depolarization can be calculated from the gradient of the straight line obtained by plottingLn J versus 1 T as to the rising portion of each peak. Ln J C tE kT wherein J is depolarization current Ampere , C is constant, AE is activation energy eV , k is Boltzmann constant and T is temperature K . Supposing the plot of depolarization current against temperature shows two peaks at 920C and 156 C respectively, activation energies associated with the respective peaks are obtained as follows Values of Ln J are plotted versus 1 T at 92, 87, 82, 770C and 156, 151, 146, 141 0C, respectively and the activation energies can be calculated from respective slopes and the Boltzmann constant, which 5 is 8.6 x 10 5 eV K. It is important that the activation energy be at least 0.2eV at least for one of the current peaks appearing at or above room temperature from the viewpoint of stability of the charges. In other words, the larger the activation energy, the longer the life span of the electret. For this reason, an electret fiber sheet in accordance with the invention preferably has an activation energy of at least 0.5 eV, particularly preferably at least 0.7 eV, and additionally shows excellent heat and chemical resistances. The higher the temperature region where a peak appears, the longer the life span of the electret.A sheet having the abovementioned temperature region at or above 500C, preferably at or above 800C, particularly above 1300C shows excellent durability and stability. Further, the electrical performance of an electret sheet is superior when the amount of polarized charges is larger. This amount corresponds to the area under the chart of depolarization current versus temperature.In a case where minus current appears, this area should be the summation of absolute values for the entire temperature range over which depolarization occurs. Thus, one aspect of the invention provides an electret fiber sheet having polarised charges on the surfaces thereof, the total charge per unit area of l0ll C cm2 the sheet being at least 7 x 10 11 C cm2, preferably at least 2 x 10 10 C cm2 , particularly at least 5x1010 C cm2 An especially preferred electret fiber sheet in accordance with the invention has polarized charges on the surfaces thereof, a total charge per unit area 11 2 of at least 7 x 10 11 C cm2 and at least a maximum activation energy of depolarization of at least 0.2 ev. Another preferred feature of the electret fiber sheet of this invention is the presence of an electric field distribution in the fiber sheet in which polarized charges 1 are oriented in one direction as shown inFigs. 1, 2 and 5. A conventional electret fiber sheet does not have such an electric field distribution, but has a distribution as shown in Fig. 3. The conventional sheet does not have the characteristic electrical properties of a sheet embodying the invention as mentioned above. Fig. 4 is a simplified illustration showing directions of respective electric power vectors represented by vector lines arrows generated by polarized charges 1 kept by electret fiber filaments constituting the conventional electret sheet of Fig.3. As is apparent from this Figure, the direction of polarization of each fiber is random and hence the vectors are offset relative to one another to provide an electric field which is weak and which rapidly dissipates with lapse of time. For this reason, this kind of electret does not have a durability for longterm use. This orientation in one direction of polarized charges is an electret fiber sheet embodying the invention, is a factor providing the abovementioned especially excellent durability and electrical properties. An electret sheet embodying this invention has excellent characteristics even as a single piece thereof.However, integration or lamination of a plurality of pieces of sheet provides a material having a longer life span and a better durability against external conditions. For example, Fig. 8 shows an illustration of lines of electric power vectors in a case where the directions of orientation of polarized charges 1 are the same in a laminate structure comprising three pieces each of an electret sheet embodying this invention. However, alternatively there may be provided a laminate structure in which the directions of vector lines are mutually reversed between respective sheets. An improvement in the durability as mentioned above of a material of the invention can be achieved by a structure having any one of these field distributions. Fig. 9 is a rough illustration of a typical apparatus for carrying out a process for producing an electret fiber sheet of this invention. A high voltage generator 10 is connected between a non contact type high voltage application electrode such as needle electrode 11 and an earth 14. Between the needle electrode 11 and earth 14 are disposed an earth electrode 12, a supplemental material 13 placed on the earth electrode 12 and a fiber sheet 15 having one surface in contact with the supplemental material 13 and its opposite surface facing needle electrode 11 and spaced from it. In order to enable the electret formation to be efficiently conducted, it is important to use a 2 fiber sheet having a weight of 80 g m2 or less. Less than 60 g m2is more preferred. When it exceeds 80 g m2, a sufficiently compensatory charge cannot be obtained from the earth electrode, leading to lowering of the surface charge density. Moreover, glow discharge tends to occur easily. Thus, too large a weight of the fiber sheet is not preferred. In addition, in order to obtain a electret fiber sheet having a large amount of polarized charges and a large surface charge density, it is important to use a fiber sheet having a covering factor of 60 or higher. 80 or higher is more preferred. When it is less than 60 , the amount of surface charge density cannot be large, because charges to be trapped pass through the openings between the fibers of the sheet. To make the weight of the fiber sheet small and to make the covering factor large, the thickness of the composed fibers is important. The fibers are preferably 3 denier 3.3 dtex or less, more preferably 1 denier 1.1 dtex or less, especially 0.5 denier about 0.6 dtex or less. Equipment for measurement of the surface charge density is shown in Fig. 14. An electret fiber sheet 19 is placed on an earth metallic plate 18, and another metallic plate 20 is brought into contact with the electret sheet 19 to generate a counter charge in the metallic plate 20 connected to a condenser 21. By reading the voltage of the condenser 21 on volt meter 22, the surface charge density can be calculated as follows. Surface charge density C x V A C Capacity of condenser F V Voltage V A Surface area of the electret sheet cm2 The surface charge density has a similar effect to the total charge density however it can be determined much more easily than the total charge density. Therefore it is often convenient to use the former in place of the latter. A graph of collection efficiency i.e. passing ratio , representing the proportional amount of aerosol particles passing through an electret fiber sheet versus surface charge density is shown in Fig. 15.A drastic increase in the collection efficiency with increasing surface charge density can be observed. The apparent density of the fiber sheet to be polarized is preferably at least 0.05 g cm3, especially 3 at least 0.1 g cm3 in order to enable it to be highly polarized. If it is small, the thickness of the sheet btYnss large and the applied charge cannot enter into the inner part of the fiber sheet because it is trapped only at the surface portion. Further, a sufficient compensatory charge cannot be obtained from the earth electrode, leading to lowering of the surface charge density. The voltage to be applied varies depending, for example, on the kind and molecular structure of material constituting the sheet, the thickness of the sheet, the shape of the non contact electrode and the distance between the electrodes, but should be greater than 3kV cm. For example, where the distance between the electrodes is 3 cm, the voltage is preferably at least 10 kV, more preferably 10 50kV, especially 25 to 40 kV. In any case, the absolute value of voltage application is preferably 3 kV cm or higher, more preferably 5 kV cm or higher. The distance between the voltage application electrode and the fiber sheet is preferably at least 5 mm and may be longer, say at least 10 mm. A field strength lower than 3 kV cm causes a difficulty in increasing the surface charge density.The effect of the applied voltage on the total charge is shown in Fig. 7, where the area under respective curves represents the total charge for each applied voltage indicated. A distance of shorter than 5 mm causes glow discharge, leading to no increase in the surface charge density. When a two stage treatment is adopted in which, say a negative high voltage is applied to one surface while a positive high voltage is then applied to the reverse surface, highly polarized charges are obtained.Either order of the two step high voltage application may be applied. The negative high voltage application is more effective than the positive high voltage application. The discharge current should be at least m mA cm2, preferably from 10 to 10 2 mA cm2 inclusive. A discharge current higher than 1 x 10 2 mA cm2 causes glow discharge, which brings about a lowering of surface charge density. Of course, a discharge current density lower than 10 mA cm2 also brings about a lowering of the surface charge density.A preferred range of discharge current density values is from 10 5 to 10 3 mA cm2 inclusive. To obtain high surface charge density, it is effective to dispose a special type of supplemental material between the fiber sheet and the earth electrode.Fig. 10 shows a graph of surface charge density versus specific resistance, i.e. volume resistivity, of the supplemental material. The respective curves correspond to surface charge densities of the front surface and the back surface, respectively the dashed sections representing estimated values not confirmed experimentally . From Fig. 10, it can be seen that a semiconductive or dielectric material having volume resistivity more than 10 1 n.cm, especially 10 1 to 109 Q.cm is effective as the supplemental material. As the semiconductive material, either a solid or liquid material may be used. For example, a film containing minute particles such as carbon particles or metallic particles dispersed therein, paint, water or alcohol containing a small amount of soluble electroconductive material may be used. As the dielectric material, an inorganic material or a polymer such as a polyolefin, fluororesin, polyester or polyamide may be used. Fig. 11 shows an alternative example of equipment to that shown in Fig. 9 for carrying out a process of this invention. A metal container 16 serving as an earth electrode and connected with ground 14 contains an electrode liquid 17 in contact with a fiber sheet 13 in a manner such that only one surface of the fiber sheet 13 is in contact with the liquid surface. In that state, the voltage generated by a high DC voltage generator 10 is applied through a non contact high voltage electrode 11 to the fiber sheet 13 to produce an electret fiber sheet. Examples of the electrode liquid are water which may contain a surface active agent and organic liquids such as acetone and alcohols. The liquid serves as a supplemental material. The liquid not only prevents glow discharge between the two electrodes but also makes the contacting area with the fiber sheet 13 very large as shown in Fig. 12.For that reason, a high voltage can be supplied without glow discharge and the electric charge can be easily and deeply accepted into the fiber through the large contacting area. In this case, it is desired to avoid infiltration of the electrode liquid up to the other surface of the fiber sheet, namely the upper surface of the fiber sheet, lest the liquid should cover the upper surface.If the upper surface of the fiber sheet is covered with the liquid, the effect of electret formation is adversely lowered. Also to avoid adverse lowering of the effect of electret formation, it is preferred to use a fiber sheet having a covering factor of 60 or higher. The temperature of the earth electrode at the high voltage application is desirably in a range of from the glass transition temperature to the melting point of the fiber sheet. When a high voltage is applied at such a temperature, an electret fiber sheet which has a high surface charge density and a deeply trapped charge and the charge on which scarcely changes with the lapse of time can be obtained. Fig. 16 shows a relation between surface charge density and temperature at the high voltage application. The period of voltage application is usually 5 seconds or longer, preferably 10 to 120 seconds. Of course, we can apply a voltage for a period of more than 120 seconds however, in most cases, the sheet becomes saturated with charge and the effect is complete in less than 10 second and too long a time causes slight decrease of the surface charge density. Examples of the non contact electrode employable in the process of the present invention are those providing essentially a point or line voltage source such as a needle electrode and a wire electrode. As an earth electrode, materials having volume resistivity lower than 10 4 Q.cm are preferable. As the fiber sheet, woven or knitted fabrics can be used as can non woven fabrics. As the woven or knitted fabrics, those made of filament yarn are more preferable than those made of spun yarn, because a large contact area with the earth electrode can be easily obtained. As the non woven fiber sheet, melt blown fiber sheets are preferable, because average fiber diameters less than 10 micrometers and large cover factors can be easily obtained. Moreover, melt blown fiber sheet is suitable for a filter for an industrial clean room because it has a high dust collection efficiency and low pressure drop. Any material may be applicable as the fiber sheet according to the present invention, but it should have 13 a volume resistivity of 10 Q.cm or higher. Examples of such a material include fibers made from any one of synthetic polymers such as polyolefins, polyesters, polycarbonate, polyfluororesins, polyacrylonitrile resins, polyamide resins and polyvinyl chloride resins and glass and other inorganic compounds. Among them polyolefin is preferred because it has high electric resistance and has no polarity. The abovementioned fibers may have any shape so long as they have a fibrous form. Further, the fibers which can be used in an electret sheet of this invention include those having a material covering thereon and containing an organic compound of 1013 Q.cm or higher in volume resistivity, for example, core sheath type fibers. The present invention aims at providing an electret fiber sheet having a capacity to remain stable and retain a high charge for a long period, and having high chemical and heat resistances, and excellent durability as compared with conventional electret sheets. Electret fiber sheets embodying this invention find utility in a wide variety of applications as filter materials adsorbing materials masks sensors such as radiation dosimeters, temperature sensors, microphones, and headphones and medical materials such as gauzes and bone growth promotors. Processes for producing electret fiber sheets embodying the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following Examples. In these Examples, the volume resistivity was determined according to the method of JIS JapaneseIndustrial Standard C 2318 or JIS C 2525. The covering factor was determined by counting light and shade sections 1 mm x 1 mm of a transparent or semi transparent graph paper placed on the enlarged magnification was x 20 shade of a specimen 2cm x 2cm made with enlarging projector. The covering factor was calculated according to the following equation, wherein B is the number of light sections formed by passage of light and C is the number of shade sections formed by shielding of light by the fiber Covering Factor 8 C B C x 100 The apparent density of the sheet was determined by the following equation 3 Apparent Density g cm3 D E x F 2 D weight per unit area g cm2 E thickness cm 2 F unit area 1 cm The thickness was measured under a load of 50g cm2.Example 1 A melt blown polypropylene fiber non woven fabric 2 having a weight of 20 g m , average fiber thickness of 0.2 denier about 0.2 dtex , covering factor of 99 , an apparent density of 0.129 g cm3, and a volume resistivity of 1016 Q.cm was used as the fiber sheet for formation of an electret with equipment as shown in Fig. 9. One iron needle electrode having a volume resistivity of 10 6R.cm was used as the voltageapplication electrode. A 20 cm square iron plate was used as the earth electrode. A 20 cm square semiconductive sheet composed of polyvinyl chloride and carbon particles uniformly dispersed therein and having 4 a thickness of 0.5 mm and a volume resistivity of 10 Q.cm was disposed as the supplemental material between the earth electrode and the melt blown fiber sheet.The distance between the needle electrode and the fiber sheet was set at about 30 mm. The fiber sheet was treated for 30 seconds in an atmosphere of 250C at an applied voltage of 30 kV, i.e., an electric field strength of 10 kV cm. The discharge current density was 3.5 x 10 4 mA cm2 during the treatment. The obtained electret fiber sheet had peaks of the depolarization chart at 900C and 1500C, and activation energies of the respective peaks of 0.45 eV and 0.71 eV. The total amount per unit area of depolarization charge i.e. polarized charge as determined from a depolarization chart was 7.2 x 10 10 C cm2, and the amount per unit area of the 10 2 depolarization charge above 1300C was 3.8 x 10 10 C cm2. 10 2The surface charge density was 7.5 x 10 10 C cm2 at the front surface and 8.5 x 10 10 C cm2 at the back surface. The sheet showed almost no change of the depolarization chart after standing in air at 200C, 60 RH for two months.Example 2 A melt blown polypropylene fiber sheet used in Example 1 was used. One surface of the sheet was contacted with an electrode of water having a volume resistivity of 5 x 105 Qcm and a voltage of 30 kV was applied with a needle electrode for 60 seconds. The depth of the water bath was 2 cm. During this treatment, the water temperature was kept at 200C and the distance between the needle electrode and the fiber sheet was kept to 5 cm. The electric field strength and the discharge current density were 6 kV cm and 2.8 x 10 4 mA cm2, respectively. In the obtained fiber sheet, the amount of electric current generated by depolarization of the polarized charges by a temperature rise was recorded. The temperatures of the peaks of the depolarization chart were 910C and 1520C, and the activation energies were 0.51 eV and 0.79 eV. The amount of polarized charge per unit area which appeared above 1300C was 4.5 x 10 10 C cm2. This sheet showed almost no change of the depolarization chart even after leaving at 200C, 95 RH for two months.Example 3 A polypropylene non woven fabric having a weight of 40 g m2, average fiber thickness of 0.9 denier about 1 dtex , 3 covering factor of 99 , an apparent density of 0.125 g cm 16 and a volume resistivity of 1016 Q.cm was used as the fiber sheet for formation of an electret with equipment as shown inFig. 9. One stainless steel needle electrode having a volume resistivity of 1 6 Qcm was used as the voltage application electrode. A 20 cm square stainless steel plate was used as the earth electrode. No supplemental material between the earth electrode and the fiber sheet was used. The distance between the needle electrode and the fiber sheet was set at about 30 mm. The fiber sheet was treated for 30 seconds in an atmosphere of 250C at an applied voltage of 20 kV, i.e., an electric field strength of 6.7 kV cm. The discharge current 4 2 was 2.5 x 10 4 mA cm2 at the treatment. The obtained electret fiber sheet had peaks of the depolarization chart at 870C and 1450C, and activation energies of the respective peaks of 0.25 eV and 0.45 eV. The total amount per unit area of the depolarization charge was 3.9 x 10 10 C cm2, and the amount per unit area of the depolarizatiqn 10 2 charge above 130 C was 1.7 x 10 10 C cm . The sheet showed almost no change in the depolarization chart after standing in air at 200C, 60 RH for one month. Example 4 The electret fiber sheet obtained in Example 1 was turned upside down and again subjected to a further voltage of 20 kV electric field strength of 6.6 kV cm, discharge current density of 5 x 10 5 mA cm2 applied to the reverse surface of the sheet for 30 seconds. Current peaks for the electret fiber sheet thus obtained were present at 920C and 1530C. The activation energies in the respective peaks were 0.55 and 0.81 eV. The total amount per unit area of polarized charge in this sheet was 1.8 x 10C cm2, and the amount per unit area of polarized charge appearing 10 2 above 1300C was 5.5 x 10 10 C cm2. After the sheet was allowed to stand at 300C and at 958 RH for two months, the measurement of polarized charge showed substantially no change in the amount.Example 5 Five pieces of the electret fiber sheet obtained inExample 1 were laminated in such a way that each charge polarization on those respective surfaces of every pair of pieces which were mutually adjacent were heteropolar with respect to one another the same direction of vector lines as shown in Fig.8 . The dust collection efficiency of this sheet was evaluated.The evaluation was made in such a way that an air stream having a polystyrene aerosol of 0.3 um polystyrene uniform latex particles supplied by Dow Chemical, USA in average particle size dispersed therein was passed through the electret fiber sheet at a speed of 2.5 cm sec. The number of particles in the air stream was counted Particle Counter manufactured byHitachi, Ltd. before and after passing the electret fiber sheet. The electret fiber sheet of Example 1 showed a dust collection efficiency of 99.997 and pressure drop of 4.5 mm aq. In contrast, a HEPA high efficiency particulate air filter sold by NIHON MUKI SENI K.K. made of glass micro fiber, showed a dust collection efficiency of 99.987 and pressure drop 21 mm aq. In the electret fiber sheet of this example, no changes of the dust collection efficiency and the pressure drop were observed after immersion in methanol for a week or after standing in 100C hot air for a week.Example 6 Two pieces of the electret fiber sheet obtained in Example 1 were laminated so that the confronting surfaces of each sheet had the same polarization. The collection efficiency of this sheet for Escherichia coli was evaluated using the apparatus shown in Fig. 17. This apparatus comprises an air inlet A, leading to a source of Escherichia coli in a container C via a valve V, drier D and filter F, and an air inlet A2 leading to a test piece T consisting of the electret fiber sheet to be tested via a filter F, having a weight of 100 g m2. The Escherichia coli from container C in which they are 8 present in an amount of 5 x 108 500 ml. of a liquid medium are led via a silica gel column S into the air stream entering at A2 and are filtered by the test piece T. Any Escherichia coli passing through the test piece are collected in a container C1 containing cultivation liquid. After cultivation to provide a measurable amount, the Escherichia coli are assayed to determine the collecting efficiency.A buffer B which serves as a trap prevents cultivation liquid from progressing further while the air is exhausted by a pump P, through a flow meter M and integral flow meterI to an exit E. An air stream 100 liters having vscherichia coli dispersed therein was passed through the electret fiber sheet at a speed of 2.5 cm sec and the number of Escherichia coli in the air stream passed through the electret fiber sheet was estimated by cultivation. No Escherichia coli was counted when the above laminated electret fiber sheet was used. On the other hand, 24Escherichia coli bacilli were counted when using the same melt blown fiber sheet but having no polarized charges thereon, in place of the above sheet. 907 Escherichia coli bacilli were counted when no filter was used. These results are shown in Fig. 18.Example 7 Polypropylene fiber volume resistivity 1016 Q.cm plain fabric composed of 75 denier 82.5 dtex multi filament yarn as warp and weft having a warp density of 101 yarns inch about 40 yarns cm and a weft density of 79 yarns inch about 31 yarns cm was used. The woven fabric had a 2 weight of 79 g m2 and a covering factor of 98 , was composed of fiber having a denier of 0.8d about 0.9 dtex , and had 3 an apparent density of 0.79 g cm . The plain fabric was polarized using the equipment shown in Fig. 9 using an applied voltage of 36 kV for a period of 40 secs. As the supplemental material, polyethylene film 100 micrometer thickness con taining metallic powder uniformly dispersed therein and having volume resistivity of 106 Q.cm was used.The electrical field strength and the discharge current density were 12 kV cm and 3.5 x 10 4 mA cm2, respectively. The peak temperatures of the discharge current were 910C and 1510C and the respective activation energies were 0.35 and 0.62 eV.Comparative Example 1 This Example illustrates the adverse effects of charging a film prior to slitting it to form a nonwoven fabric structure, as in US 3998916. A polypropylene film was charged to provide an electret film which was thereafter cut. The resulting slit film of 32 pm in width and 10 pm in thickness was formed, with a card, into a non woven fabric sheet 2 having an areal weight of 360 g m outside the process of the invention and a thickness of 6.5 mm. The depolarization current for the sheet thus obtained was measured to obtain a chart as shown in Fig. 13. This result suggested that the electric field distribution of the sheet was random. Thus, the chart had no characteristic current peaks as realized by an electret fiber sheet embodying the present invention. The dust collection efficiency of this sheet was evaluated according to the method of Example 5. It was 99.850 . The dust collection efficiency of this sheet after its immersion in methanol for one week was 90.72 . This means that the polarized charge was not stable in this sheet. Comparative Example 2 This Example illustrates the adverse effects of using contact electrodes, i.e. where no air gap is provided between the electrode and the fiber sheet, as in the method of JP B 4433 74. The melt blown fiber sheet used in Example 1 was sandwiched between two 20 cm square polymethylmethacrylate PMMA plates of 5 mm thickness. The two PMMA plates were further sandwiched between two metallic electrode plates and 20 kV was charged between the two electrodes. No discharge current was observed. Though the depolarization current versus temperature was measured, the peak temperature and activation energy were not clearly measurable. The amount of depolarized 11 2 charge per unit area was only 5 x 10 11 C cm . Further, lowering of the amount of polarized charge was observed after standing at 200C, 65 RH for one week.Comparative Example 3 This Example illustrates the adverse effects of using a fiber sheet laminate which is too heavy. 2 A non woven sheet having weight of 140g m2 was made by laminating seven non woven sheets each having a weight of 20 g m2. The laminated non woven sheet 3 had an apparent density of 0.09 g cm3, covering factor of 98 , average fiber thickness of 2.5 denier 2.75 dtex and volume resistivity of the fiber material polypropylene of 1016 Q.cm. Although high voltage application was attempted using this laminated nonwoven sheet in the same way as Example 1, it caused glow discharge. The above experiment was repeated, changing the applied voltage of 10 kV cm to 6. The current density was 1.2 x 10 4 mA cm2.The depolarization versus temperature curve showed no clear peak temperature and activation energy, and the total amount of the depolarized charge per unit area was only 11 2 6x1011 C cm2. Further, the individual sheets of the laminate were separated from one another delaminated , and their respective surface charge densities evaluated. The total amount per unit area of polarized 11 2 charge was only 1.5 x 10 11 C cm . The surface charges of the respective component sheets of the laminate are shown in Fig. 19. Comparative Example 4 An electret fiber sheet was made by applying a high voltage during a melt blow process for preparing polypropylene fibers. The distance between the needle electrode and earth electrode was 5 cm and the applied voltage was 45 kV electric field strength 9 kV cm .An electret sheet was made by collecting the meltblown fibers on a conveyer. The average fiber thickness of the fibers was 0.2 denier about 0.2 dtex and the weight of the sheet was 80 g m2. The plot of depolarized charge versus temperature was similar to that of Comparative Example 1, which is shown in Fig. 13. This process illustrates the poor results which we obtained when applying a high voltage during a meltblow process such as that described in US A 4215682.
