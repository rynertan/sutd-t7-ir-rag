# Method and apparatus for rapidly dissolving polymers in water.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for rapidly dissolving particles of dry water soluble polymers or gums in water. A suspen sion of polymer particles is formed and subjected to condi tions of high shear in a particle size reduction apparatus whereby the finely divided particles are forced into solution. Sufficient water is present that heat is dissipated and mo lecular degradation of the polymer is avoided.
