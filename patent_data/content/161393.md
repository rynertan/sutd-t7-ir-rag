## Description
Description Low Magnetostriction Amorphous Metal Alloys Background of the Invention 1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to amorphous metal alloys that include metalloid elements.2. Description of the Prior ArtThere are three physical parameters which can inhibit the easy magnetization and demagnetization of magnetic materials strong anisotropy, non zero magnetostriction and, at high frequencies, low resistivity. Metallic glasses generally show resistivities greater than 100 micro ohm cm, whereas crystallinie and polycrystalline magnetic metals generally show sesistivities below 50 micro ohm cm. Also, because of their randomly disordered structures, metallic glasses are typically isotropic in their physical properties, including their magnetization. Because of these two characteristics, metallic glasses have an initial advantage over conventional magnetic metals. However, metallic glasses do not generally show zero magnetostriction.WhEn zero magnetostriction glasses can be found they are generally good soft magnetic metals R.C.

Hiltzinger of Vacuumschmeltze A.G., Hanau, Germany.Reference to Co rich glasses containing 6 atom percent ofCr is made by N. Heiman, R.D. Hempstead and N. Kazama inJournal of Applied Physics, Vol. 49, p. 5663, 1978. Their interest was in improving the corrosion resistance of Co B thin films. No reference to magnetostriction is made in that article.Saturation moments and Curie temperatures ofCo80 xTxP10B10 glasses T Mn, Cr, or V were recently reported by T. Mizoguchi in the Supplement of the ScientificReports of RITU Research Institutes of Tonoku University ,A June 1978, p. 117. No reference to their magnetostrictive properties was reported.In Journal of Applied Physics, Vol. 50, p. 7597, 1979, S. Ohnuma and T. Masumoto outline their studies of magnetization and magnetostriction in Co Fe B Si glasses with light transition metal Mn, Cr, V, W, Ta, Mo and Nb substitutions. They show that the coercivity decreases and the effective permeability increases in the composition range near zero magnetostriction. New applications requiring improved soft zero magnetic materials that are easily fabricated and have excellent stability have necessitated efforts to develop further compositions. Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides low magnetostriction and zero magnetostriction glassy alloys that are easy to fabricate and thermally stable. The alloys are at least 50 percent glassy and consist essentially of compositions defined by the formula Nio.sCOo.sxTx 100 bMb where T is at least one of Mn, Cr and V, B is at least one of B, Si, P, C andGe, x is less than 0.25, and b ranges from 17 to 22 atom percent , said alloy containing up to 2 atom percent of at least one of B, Si, P, C and Get having a value of magnetostriction of about 8 x 10 6 to 2 x 10 6 and a saturation induction of about 0.3 to 0.8T, or by the formula Ni0.75C00.25 T 100 , where T is at least one of Mn,Cr and V, M is at least one of B, Si, P, C and Ge, x ranges up to about 0.25, and b ranges from about 17 to 22 atom percent., said alloy containing up to 2 atom percent of at least one of B, Si, P, C and Ge, having a value of magnetostriction of about 6 x 10 6 to 2 x 10 6 and a saturation induction of about 0.1 to 0.7T.Preferrably M is essentially boron.The purity of the above composition is that found in normal commercial practice. Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsThe amorphous alloys of the invention can be formed by cooling a melt of the composition at a rate of at least about 105 C sec. A variety of techniques are available, as is now well known in the art, for fabricating splat quenched foils and rapid quenched continuous ribbons, wire, sheet, etc. Typically, a particular composition is selected, powders of the requisite elements or of materials that decompose to form the elements, such as nickel borides, etc. in the desired proportions are melted and homogenized, and the molten alloy is rapidly quenched either on a chill surface, such as a rotating cooled cylinder, or in a suitable fluid medium, such as a chilled brine solution. The amorphous alloys may be formed in air.However, superior mechanical properties are achieved by forming these amorphous alloys in a partial vacuum with absolute pressure less than about 5.5 cm of Hg, and preferably about 100 jim to 1 cm of Hg, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,154,283 to Ray et al.The amorphous metal alloys are at least 50 per cent amorphous, and preferably at least 80 per cent amorphous, as measured by X ray diffraction. However, a substantial degree of amorphousness approaching 100 per cent amorphous is obtained by forming these amorphous metal alloys in a partial vacuum. Ductility is thereby improved, and such alloys possessing a substantial degree of amorphousness are accordingly preferred.Ribbons of these alloys find use in soft magnetic applications and in applications requiring low magnetostriction, high thermal stability e.g., stable up to about 1000C and excellent fabricability. Ni rich glasses are easily made and are more stable if the late transition metal Ni is balanced to a certain extent by an early TS, e.g., Mn, Cr, V. Examples of such glasses include Ni50n30B20, Ni60Cr20B20, or Ni70V10B20 Based on the evidence of 15 0 alloys set forth above and the known stabilizing effects of light TM s on Ni rich glasses, new low.magnetostriction glasses rich in Ni have been developed in the region below or near theA s 0 line inFigure 8 i.e., glasses initially shbwingl s O by the addition of Mn, Cr, and or V. Thus, for example, Co 25Ni75 80B20 can be rendered more fabricable and more stable in the glassy state, and its negative magnetostriction can be increased to near zero by substituting Mn, Cr or V for Co Ni 75Co .25xTx 80B20.
