# Assembling electric storage batteries, a clamp therefor, a multicell electric storage battery including such a clamp and a stack of plate arrays for such a battery engaged by a clamp.

## Abstract
A clamp for use in the assembly of multicell electric storage batteries comprises two spaced opposing clamping members each including a plurality of clamping elements 2 which are connected but spaced apart by a gap 4. The clamping elements are arranged in two spaced parallel lines and are each adapted to contact a surface of a respec tive cell pack of a battery. Biassing means connects the two clamping members and is adapted to urge each clamping element of each clamping member towards a correspond ing clamping element on the other clamping member.
