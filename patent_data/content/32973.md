# Apparatus for the automatic discharge of panels from a machining line.

## Abstract
The apparatus for the automatic discharge of wood panels from the workpiece support A of a machining line onto lifting and lowering supports 8, 9 so as to form stacks of superposed panels, comprises a tilting table 1 which can be tilted around a fulcrum axis 2 so as to bring its discharge edge 101 in close proximity with the upper supporting sur face of the lifting and lowering support 8,9 . Transversal abutment means 10, 14 cooperate with the supporting sur face of the tilting table in such a manner that, whenever the inclined tilting table is horizontally moved transversally to the said abutment means, the panels lying thereon are dis charged onto the underlying lifting and lowering support, since they are prevented by the abutment means from fol lowing the movement of the tilting table.
