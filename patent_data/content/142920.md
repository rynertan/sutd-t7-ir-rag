## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO 6 OXODECAHYDROQUINOLINES This invention concerns a class of novel 6 oxodecabydroquinolines, which are useful intermediates in preparing pharmaceuticals. In preparing octahydropyrazolo 3 ,4 g guino lines, United States Patent 4,198,415, or octahydro 2H pyrrolol3,4 glquinolines, United States Patent 4,235,909, an intermediate, trans 1 alkyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline of the following structure I is usedEMI1.1 where R is C1 C3 alkyl or benzyl. Reaction of this compound with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal forms a 6 oxo 7 dimethylaminomethylenedecahydroquinoline I I EMI2.1 Reaction with an alkylformate yields a 7 formyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline III .EMI2.2 Further reaction of 11 or III with hydra zine or potassium glycinate yields the trans 5 alkyloctahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3, 4 g guinoline of UnitedStates Patent 4,198,415 or the trans 5 alkylocta hydro 2H pyrrolo 3,4 g guinoline of United States Patent 4,235,909, wherein R is lower alkyl or benzyl in either patent. The same intermediates 11 and III react with guanidine or N methyl guanidine or N,N dimethylguanidine to yield the trans 2 amino methylamino, dimethylamino 6 alkyl 5,5a,6,7,8,9,9a,10 octahydro pyrimido 4,5 gjquinolines disclosed in our copending application 84305684.7. Identical chemistry can be carried out on the separated isomers of formula I particularly the trans 4aR,8aR isomer IV EMI3.1 In the pyrazolo 3,4 g guinoline of U.S. Patent 4,198,415, the trans isomer has the prolactin inhibiting and anti Parksonian activity of the racemate and is particularly useful in hypertensitn see Hahn et al., J.Pharm. Exper. Therap., 224, 206 1983 . The same situation is apparently present with the 6 alkylocta hydropyrimido 4,5 g quinolines i.e., the trans isomer has the great majority, if not the entire, dopamine agonist activity of the trans racemate.The trans isomers can be prepared by resolution of the final product see U.K. Patent publication 2,129,423 for the resolution of trans 5 n propyl 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline. Alternatively, the trans l alkyl or l benzyl 6oxodecahydroquinoline I can be resolved see U.K.Patent publication 2,129,422 for the preparation of trans 4aR 1 n propyl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline and the resolved compound transformed to an octahydropyrazolo or pyrrolo 3,4 g guinoline or an octahydropyrimido 4,5 g quinoline by the above procedures. However, a synthetic problem exists for the preparation of final products of any of the three series in which the quinoline nitrogen is to be substituted with allyl. The method available for the synthesis of formula I United States Patent 4,198,415, for example involve hydrogenations, which could transform an allyl group to an n propyl group.In the octahydropyrazolo 3 ,4 g guinolines or octahydropyrrolo 3,4 g quinolines, the alkyl or benzyl group of the l substituted 6 oxodecahydroquinoline can be removed by treatment with cyanogen bromide or ethyl chloroformate followed by treatment with cyanogen bromide or ethyl chloroformate followed by the synthetic procedure of Example l.of United States Patent 4,198,315 where a l benzyl 6 hydroxydecahydroguinoline is transformed to 1 cyano6 oxodecahydroquinoline V EMI4.1 which is in turn used to prepare trans i 5 cyano 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9 octahydro lH and 213 pyrazolo 3,4 g quinoline. The cyano group is then removed with Zn in acetic acid to yield the secondary amine VI EMI5.1 which can be alkylated or allylated as desired. However, since the two ring intermediate V can be used to prepare at least two different three ring compounds i.e., 5 cyano octahydro lH and 2H pyrazolo 3 ,4 g quinolines and 2 amino 6 cyano octahydropyrimido 4,5 g quinoline, either of which can be allylated after removal of the CN group, it might be preferable to form the N allyl derivative at an earlier step in the respective synthetic procedures. In fact, because of the difference in ease of alkylating or allylating an octahydropyrazoloquinoline versus an octahydropyrimidoquinoline, it may be virtually mandatory in the second instance to carry out such an alkylation or allylation reaction prior to ring closure with guanidine.The problem is that alkylation or allylation of a secondary amine like the quinoline ring nitrogen of the octa hydropyrimido 4, 5 g guinoline may be accompanied by alkylation or allylation of the primary 2 amino or secondary 2 methylamino group of the pyrimidine ring, not to Invention quaternary salt formation with the pyrimidine ring nitrogens, for example, by the alkylating moiety. The compounds of formula I when R is benzoyl are disclosed by Johnson et al., J. Org. Chem., 33, 3207 1968 . Microbiological oxidation of N benzoyl trans decahydroquinoline provided a trans l benzoyl 6 hydroxydecahydroquinoline. In determining the position and configuration of the 6 hydroxyl, the trans derivative was transformed to trans 6 hydroxy or oxo decahydroquinoline. Neither the trans racemate or the trans enantiomer were prepared. This invention provides processes and intermediates which avoid the drawbacks associated with the processes and intermediates of the prior art for preparing useful dopamine agonists containing an N allyl group. This invention provides trans dl decahydroquinoline of structure VII and the trans enantiomer thereof, structure VIII ,EMI6.1 wherein, when taken singly, one of R3 and R4 is H and the other is OH, and when taken together, R3 and R4 form an oxo group 0 or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. The compounds of formula VII or VIII are prepared by a cleaving a trans dl compound of the formulaEMI7.1 or its trans enantiomer of the formulaEMI7.2 wherein R3 and R4 are defined as before, by conventional methods or b oxidizing a compound of formula VII or VIII in which one of R3 and R4 is H and the other isOH with an oxidizing agent to provide the compounds of formula VII or VIII in which R3 and R4 are taken together to form an oxo group or c reducing a compound of formula VII or VIII as defined before in which R3 and R4 are taken together to form an oxo group with a reducing agent to provide the compounds of formula VII or VIII as defined above in which one of R3 and R4 is H and the other OH or d cleaving a trans 6 keta compound of the formulaEMI8.1 or its trans enantiomer of the formulaEMI8.2 wherein R5 and R6 are each C1 C4 alkyl or when taken together are CH2 C CH3 2 CH2 or t H2 where n is 2, 3 or 4, with formic acid or an aqueous acid to provide the compounds of formula VII or VIII as defined before in which R3 and R4 are taken together to form an oxo group and optionally followed by resolving a compound of formula VII to provide the corresponding trans enantiomer and optionally salifying a compound of formula VII or VIII by conventional methods. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of formula VII or VIII include salts derived from non toxic inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like, as well as salts derived from non toxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids.Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, fluoride, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, butyne 1,4dioate, hexyne 1,6 dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesul fonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, beta hydroxybutyrate, glycollate, malate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene l sulfonate, naphthalene 2 sulfonate and the like salts. Compounds of formula VII have two asymmetric centers at 4a and 8a. This structure represents 4 stereoisomers occurring as two di as tereoisomeric pairs or racemates, a cis racemate both 4a and 8a hydrogens on the same side of the plane of the isoquinoline ring and a trans racemate in which the bridgehead hydrogens at 4a and 8a are on opposite sides of the plane of the isoquinoline ring . This invention includes the trans racemate VII and the trans 4aR,8aR stereoisomer VIII component. Intermediates of formula VIII are particularly valuable because drugs derived from them, which carry C1 C3 alkyl or an allyl group, contain the greater part, if not all, of the dopaminergic activity of the racemate. The racemate VII can be named as a trans molecular compound or as a trans dl molecular compound.The stereoisomer VIII can be named as a trans compound, as a trans Q compound, as a 4aR,8aR derivative or as a 4aa,8aB derivative. Compounds represented by formulae VII and VIII are prepared by N dealkylating a compound of the formula IX or X EMI11.1 where R, R3 and R4 have their previous meaning, with cyanogen bromide CN Br in an inert mutual solvent such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon. The resulting 1 cyano compounds have the formula XI or XII EMI11.2 wherein R3 and R4 have their previous meaning. The CN group is then removed, as by reduction with zinc and an acid, such as acetic acid, or zinc dust and HC1, or simply by treatment with acid, such as a strong mineral acid, e.g., HC1 or HzSO4, or by hydrogenolysis by standard methods, for example, hydrogen and a palladium on carbon or platinum on carbon catalyst, to yield the compounds of formulae VII and VIII . Additionally, compounds of formula VII or VIII wherein R3 and R4 together form an oxo group, can be prepared from compounds in which one of R3 and This H and the other is OH by oxidation, preferably with chromic acid, or chromic anhydride in dilute H2SO4 JonesReagent , or pyridine hydrochloride Cr03 Sarett sReagent . Similarly, trans i l cyano 6 hydroxydecahydroquinoline and the trans stereoisomer, can be so oxidized prior to removal of the CN group. Also, the compounds of formula VII or VIII wherein s3 and R4 are taken together to form an oxo group can be reduced with a reducing agent to provide the compounds of formula VII or VIII wherein one ofR3 and R4 is H and the other is OH. Examples of suitable reducing agents are sodium borohydride, LiBH4, LiAlH4, NaCNBH3, modified aluminum hydrides and other conventional reducing agents. Suitable solvents areC1 C4 alkanol such as methanol or ethanol, ethers, THF, dioxane and other solvents suitable for use with the listed reducing agents. The preferred temperature is about SOC,to reflux, especially 0 C. The compounds of formula VII or VIII wherein R3 and R4 are taken together to form an oxo group can also be prepared by cleaving a trans 6 ketal compound of the formula EMI13.1 or its trans enantiomer of the formulaEMI13.2 wherein R5 and R6 are each C1 C4 alkyl or when taken together are CH2 C CH3 2 CH2 or CH2 n where n is 2, 3 or 4, with formic acid or an aqueous acid. Suitable aqueous acids are acetic acid, mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, and sulfonic acids such as p toluene sulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid and methanesulfonic acid. The reaction is run at a temperature from room temperature to reflux. The 6 ketal derivative of formula XIII or XIV above are prepared by conventional methods. One method is reaction of the 6 oxo compound with ethylene glycol in toluene with p toluenesulfonic acid at reflux temperature. The N substituted compounds, e.g., CN, C1 C3 alkyl, having the 6 ketal present can be cleaved at the 1 position to form the l unsubstituted compounds by hydrogenolysis as described above. The 6 ketal group is then removed as described before to provide the 6 oxo compounds of formula VII or VIII . The compounds of formula VII can be resolved into the trans enantiomer of formula VIII by conventional methods. For example, by recrystallization of the diastereomeric salts formed between the trans t compounds and an optically active acid or by derivatizing the l unsubstituted compound with, for example, an amide, and separating the diastereomers. This invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples Example 1 Preparation of trans dl 6 oxodecahydroquinoline from the l benzyl derivative Fifty three grams of trans dl 1 benzyl 6hydroxydecahydroquinoline were dissolved in 1.5 1. of methylene chloride and the solution cooled to about 0 C. in an ice water bath.
