## Description
This invention relates to pellets of fibre reinforcedcompositions containing thermoplastics resins and to methodsof producing such pellets. Processes are known in which a fibre reinforced structureis produced by pulling a tow or roving of glass fibres througha bath of low viscosity thermosettable resin to impregnate thefibres. The structure is subsequently cured by heating. Suchprocesses are known as pultrusion processes. Although suchprocesses have been known for at least 10 years they have notbeen used commercially to any extent for the production ofthermoplastics resin impregnated structures. This is becauseof difficulties experienced in wetting the fibres when theyare pulled through the viscous molten resin. The resultingproducts have unacceptable properties as a result of this poorwetting. The extent of wetting the fibres achieved by a particularprocess and thereby providing the basis for making maximum useof the very high levels of physical properties inherent incontinuous fibres, such as glass fibres, may be assessed bymeasuring the extent to which the process provides a producthaving a flexural modulus approaching the theoreticallyattainable flexural modulus. The theoretically attainable flexural modulus iscalculated using the simple rule of mixtures The use of melts of conventional high molecular weightthermoplastics for impregnating continuous rovings does notpermit a high level of flexural modulus to be obtained. Forexample, United States Patent No. 3 993 726 discloses an improved process of impregnating continuous rovings under highpressure in a cross head extruder, pulling the rovings througha die and cooling and shaping the rovings into a void freeshaped article. Products obtained using polypropylene areshown in Example 1 to have a flexural modulus of only about6GN m Swiss Patent 500,060 describes glass fibre reinforcedcompositions of high fibre content which have been preparedby processes which include a melt impregnation process. Thepurpose of the invention is to provide masterbatch granuleswhich are diluted with further non reinforced resin forinjection molding purposes. No information is given on theproperties of continuous product produced but it can bededuced that the process does little more than coat strandsof fibres with the resin because it is stated that unless theproduct is chopped at an elevated temperature the product isa mass of shattered fibreglass resin. This is indicative ofthe fact that bundles of unwetted filaments are still presentin the continuous product. It has now been found possible to produce materials ina continuous process having flexural modulus levels whichapproach the theoretically attainable levels. It has beenfound that pellets chopped from this continuous product haveoutstanding advantages for a number of processes. Accordingly, there is provided moulding pellets being cutto a length between 2 and 100mm from a thermoformable fibre reinforcedstructure comprising a thermoplastic polymer andat least 30 by volume of aligned reinforcing filaments whichhave been wetted by a melt of the thermoplastic in a meltpultrusion process, characterised in that the filaments havebeen wetted by a melt which has a viscosity at low shear ratesof less than 100 Ns m The extent of wetting of at least 70 may be assessed bymeasuring the extent to which the continuous structure has alongitudinal flexural modulus determined by ASTM D790 80 of at least 70 of the theoretically attainable flexural modulus,and preferably at least 90 of the theoretically attainableflexural modulus. The interlaminar shear strength of the structure is inexcess of 10 MN m Fibre reinforced pellets according to the inventioncan be produced by a variety of processes which enablegood wetting of continuous, aligned, fibres to beachieved. In one of these processes there is provided aprocess of producing a fibre reinforced compositioncomprising drawing a plurality of continuous filamentsthrough a melt of a thermoplastics polymer having a meltviscosity of less than 30 Ns m Surprisingly, despite the fact that such a polymeris of lower molecular weight than normally consideredsuitable in the thermoplastics polymer field for achievingsatisfactory physical properties the reinforcedcompositions have exceptionally good physical properties.Thus when reinforced thermosetting polymer compositionsare produced by a pultrusion process the viscosity of thethermosetting prepolymer resin in the impregnation bath istypically less than 1 Ns m The use of a thermoplastics polymer of low enoughmolecular weight to give a sufficiently low melt viscosityto result in adequate fibre wetting in a pultrusionprocess surprisingly gives a product of high strength. Thus a fibre reinforced thermoplastics pellet can beobtained by drawing a plurality of continuous filamentsthrough a melt of the thermoplastics polymer having a meltviscosity of less than 30 Ns m By the term continuous fibres or plurality ofcontinuous filaments is meant any fibrous product inwhich the fibres are sufficiently long to give a roving ortow of sufficient strength, under the processingconditions used, to be hauled through the molten polymerwithout the frequency of breakage which would render theprocess unworkable. Suitable materials are glass fibre,carbon fibre, jute and high modulus synthetic polymerfibres. In the latter case it is important that thepolymer fibres conform to the proviso of having sufficientstrength to be capable of being hauled through the polymermelt without breakage disrupting the process. In order tohave sufficient strength to be hauled through theimpregnation system without breakage the majority of the continuous fibres of the fibrous product should lie in onedirection so that the fibrous product can be drawn throughmolten polymer with the majority of the continuous fibresaligned. Fibrous products such as mats made up ofrandomly disposed continuous fibrous are not suitable foruse in the invention unless they form part of a fibrestructure in which at least 50 by volume of the fibresare aligned in the direction of draw. The continuous fibres may be in any form havingsufficient integrity to be pulled through the moltenpolymer but conveniently consist of bundles of individualfibres or filaments, hereinafter termed rovings in whichsubstantially all the fibres are aligned along the lengthof the bundles. Any number of such rovings may beemployed. In the case of commercially available glassrovings each roving may consist of up to 8000 or morecontinuous glass filaments. Carbon fibre tapes containingup to 6000 or more carbon fibres may be used. Clothswoven from rovings are also suitable for use in thepresent invention. The continuous fibres may be providedwith any of the conventional surface sizes, particularlythose designed to maximise bonding between the fibre andthe matrix polymer. The thermoplastics polymer employed in the processhereinbefore described may be any polymer which will meltto form a coherent mass providing that the melt has aviscosity of less than 30 Ns m In the process of impregnating the fibres of theroving, in addition to using a polymer of suitable meltviscosity to bring about adequate wetting it is necessaryto maximise penetration of the melt into the roving. Thismay be done by separating, as far as possible, the rovingsinto the individual constituent fibres, for example, byapplying an electrostatic charge to the roving prior toits entry into the molten polymer or preferably byspreading the roving whilst it is in the molten polymer toseparate the constituent filaments. This is convenientlyachieved by passing the roving under tension over at leastone, and preferably several, spreader surfaces. Furtherenhancement of wetting occurs if further work is appliedto the separated, polymer impregnated, fibres, forexample, by consolidating the separated fibres by pullingthe impregnated roving from the melt through a die. Thisdie may have the profile desired of the impregnated rovingor the impregnated roving may be passed through a furthersizing die whilst the polymer is still flowable.Surprisingly, it is advantageous if this die is cooled inorder to achieve satisfactory sizing and a smooth passagethrough the die. When the impregnated rovings emerge fromthe bath in the form of a flat sheet further work may beapplied by passing the sheet between a pair of rollers. The rate at which the roving can be hauled throughthe impregnation bath is dependent on the requirement thatthe individual fibres should be adequately wetted. Thiswill depend, to a large extent on the length of the paththrough the molten polymer bath and in particular theextent of the mechanical spreading action to which the roving is subjected in the bath. The rates achievable inthe present process are at least comparable with the ratesachievable in thermoset pultrusion processes because thelatter process is restricted by the time required tocomplete necessary chemical reactions after theimpregnation stage. In a preferred embodiment the spreader surfaces overwhich the rovings are pulled to provide separation of therovings are provided with an external heat input to heatthe spreader surface a temperature above the melting pointof the particular polymer to be used for impregnating theroving. By this means the melt viscosity of the polymerin the local region of the spreader surface may bemaintained at a considerably lower value than the polymerin the bulk of the impregnation bath. This process hasthe advantage that a very small proportion of the polymercan be raised to a relatively high temperature so that alow impregnation viscosity can be obtained with minimumrisk of degradation to the major proportion of the polymerin the bath. This in turn greatly reduces the problemarising from the fact that some polymer may remain in thebath for an almost unlimited period during a givenprocessing period because the polymer supply in the bathis continually replenished. Thus some of the polymerpresent at the start of a processing period may still bepresent in the bath at the end of the processing period.Despite this long dwell time in the bath such polymer willhave been subjected to a less severe thermal history thanif the whole of the polymer in the bath had been subjectedto a high temperature to obtain a low viscosity throughoutthe bath. A further advantage of the local heating process isthat polymers of poorer thermal stability may be used.Furthermore, polymers of higher molecular weight may beused because the lower degradation arising from the lower overall thermal history enables a higher temperature to beused locally to produce lower viscosity melt. The supply of polymer to the impregnation bath may bein the form of polymer powder which is melted in the bathby external heating elements or by the internally disposedheated spreader surfaces or alternatively the bath may befed with molten polymer using, for example, a conventionalscrew extruder. If the bath is provided with heatedspreader surfaces the polymer melt delivered from theextruder should be at as low a temperature as possible tominimise thermal degradation. The use of a melt feed hasthe advantages of easier start up, better temperaturecontrol and the avoidance of unmelted polymer lumps whichresult in various processing problems particularly whenvery thin structures are produced. The impregnated fibre product may be pulled through ameans for consolidating the product such as a sizing die.The temperature of the die has been found to have asignificant effect on the process. Although it would bepredicted that a hot die should be used to minimisefriction in the die and to aid consolidation it has beenfound that a die which is held at a temperature at orabove the melting point of the polymer used gives rise toan erratic stick slip behaviour as the product is pulledthrough the die. It has been found that it is preferableto use a cooled die and to ensure that the surfacetemperature of the pultruded section entering the die isat a temperature of not more than 20 C above the softeningtemperature of the polymer. By softening temperature wemean the lowest temperature at which the polymer can besintered. This can be achieved by blowing air on the laceduring its path between the impregnation bath and the dieand or spacing the die from the impregnation bath. If thepultruded section is too hot polymer is squeezed out asthe product enters the die. This leaves a deposit at the entrance to the die which builds up and can score thepultruded section as it passes through the die. Thepultruded section should not be cooled to a temperaturebelow the softening point of the polymer because it willbe too difficult to shape the product in the sizing die. In a further process for producing fibre reinforcedpellets according to the invention it has been foundpossible to achieve satisfactory wetting even though thethermoplastics polymer used has a melt viscositysignificantly in excess of 30 Ns m In one embodiment of this process of producing thepellets the continuous filaments are most suitablytensioned and aligned by pulling them from rolls or reelsover a series of spreader surfaces, such as the surfacesof rods. This enables bundles of filaments to be spread out as far as possible into individual filaments which areunder considerable tension. These filaments are guided toprovide a band of contiguous filaments as they pass over aheated spreader surface. The shape of the spreadersurface and the angle of contact of the filament band withthe surface should be such as to provide a nip between theband and the heated spreader surface. A thermoplasticspolymer powder is fed to the nip and the heated spreadersurface is maintained at a temperature sufficient to meltthe thermoplastics polymer. The melt impregnates and wetsthe fibres of the band as the band passes over the heatedspreader surface. This process may be further modified by providing atleast one further heated spreader surface with which theat least partially polymer impregnated fibre band forms asecond nip by means of which a further supply of polymermelt may be impregnated into the fibre band. Eithersurface of the partially impregnated band can be used toform the working surface of the nip. The amount of polymer in the reinforced structure iscontrolled to a large extent by the tension in the bandand the length of path over which the band contacts theheated spreader surface. Thus where the band is underhigh tension and contacts the spreader surface over asubstantial area, so that the band is strongly urgedagainst the spreader surface, the polymer content of thereinforced structure will be lower than under lowtension short contact path conditions. The heated spreader surfaces and any subsequentheated or cooled surfaces used to improve impregnation orto improve surface finish are preferably in the form ofcylindrical bars or rollers. These may be stationary orcapable of either free or driven rotation. For example,the first impregnation surface may be a freely rotatingroller which will be caused to rotate by the band at the speed of the band so that attrition of the fibre prior toimpregnation or sizing by the melt is reduced to aminimum. It has been observed that if the first roll isrotated either freely or driven in the direction of themovement of the fibre at up to the speed of the fibre anyaccumulation of loose fibre on the band is carried throughthe system. This self cleaning action is particularlyuseful in preventing an accumulation of fibre at the firstroll which could cause splitting of the band. After theband has picked up some molten polymer, preferably afterbeing provided with further molten polymer on the otherside of the band by means of a second freely rotatableheated surface, the fibre is much less susceptible toattrition and may be subjected to treatments to improvewetting of the fibres. Thus the polymer containing bandmay be passed over at least one roller driven in adirection opposite to that of the travel of the band toincrease the local work input on the band and maximisewetting. In general, the degree of wetting and the speedof the process may be increased by increasing the numberof surfaces at which there is a work input. A further advantage of the process employing a bandof fibre to form a nip, over the process which requiresthe use of a bath of molten polymer, is that of reducingthe risk of degradation. Thus the relatively small amountof polymer present in the nip between the fibre band andthe spreader surface ensures that large quantities ofpolymer are not held at an elevated temperature forprolonged periods. Provision can also be made to includea scraper blade at positions at which polymer is fed tothe nip to remove any excess polymer which mightaccumulate during processing and which might be subject tothermal degradation. The impregnated products of the processeshereinbefore described are chopped into lengths forsubsequent fabrication. These may be used in conventionalmoulding or extrusion processes. When glass fibre is used the fibre content of theproduct of the invention should be at least 50 by weightof the product to maximise the physical properties of theproduct. The upper limit of fibre content is determinedby the amount of polymer required to wet out theindividual fibres of the roving. In general it isdifficult to achieve good wetting with less than 20 byweight of polymer although excellent results areobtainable using the process of the invention toincorporate 30 by weight of polymer in the fibre reinforcedcomposition. The pultruded products of the invention are alsosuitable, when chopped to appropriate dimensions forproviding selective reinforcement in shaped articlesmoulded from polymeric materials in a process in which atleast one preformed element consisting of a productaccording to the present invention is located in a mouldto provide reinforcement in a selected portion of thefinished moulding and polymeric material is moulded aroundthe in situ reinforcement to provide a shaped article. The invention not only permits the fibrousreinforcement to be located in the shaped article withmaximum effect with respect to the stresses the shapedarticle will be subjected to in use but overcomes theprocessing problems involved in producing such highstrength articles by alternative processes. In particularthe process can be used to produce such reinforcedarticles using the high productivity injection mouldingprocess using conventional thermoplastic polymers withmelt viscosities of 100 Ns m It may be advantageous in some applications to usethe preformed element at a temperature at which it isreadily pliable so that it can be more readily located inthe mould, for example by winding the heat softenedpreformed element on a mould insert. The moulding process used may be any process in whicha shaped article is formed from a polymeric material in amould. The polymeric material may be a thermoplasticsmaterial which is introduced into the mould as a melt,such as in injection moulding or as a powder, as incompression moulding. Included in the term compressionmoulding is the process of compressing a polymerpowder without melting and subsequently sintering the green moulding outside the mould. The thermoplasticspolymeric material moulded in the mould may also bederived by introducing into the mould a monomer ormonomers, or a partially polymerised medium which is heldin the mould until fully polymerised, for example, underthe influence of heat or chemical activators orinitiators. It is preferred that the polymer which is mouldedaround the preformed insert is the same as or is at leastcompatible with the polymer used to impregnate thepreformed insert. The impregnated products obtained from the processeshereinbefore described find particular utility whenchopped into pellets or granules in which the reinforcingfibres have a length of at least 3 mm and preferably atleast 10 mm. These products may be used in theconventional fabrication process such as injectionmoulding and show advantages over prior art products inpellet form because the fibre length in the pellet isretained to a much greater extent in articles fabricatedfrom the pellets of the invention than when using theprior art products. This greater retention of fibre length is believed to be a result of the greaterprotection afforded to the individual reinforcingfilaments in the product of the invention by virtue of thegood wetting by polymer which arises from use of theprocesses hereinbefore described. This aspect of the invention is particularlyimportant because it enables reinforced articles to beformed in versatile operations, such as injectionmoulding, which employ screw extrusion processes to meltand homogenise the feed material, with a surprisingly highretention of fibre length and consequent enhancement ofphysical properties. Thus the product of the inventionenables moulded articles to be obtained from fabricationprocesses which employ screw extrusion which articlescontain at least 50 and preferably at least 70 by weightof the fibres in the article of a length at least 3 mmlong. This is considerably longer than currentlyobtainable from the commercially available reinforcedproducts. An alternative process of forming mouldedarticles by melting and homogenising the products of theinvention, that is lengths between 2 and 100 mm, is bycalendering. For example, a sheet product can be made inthis manner. The products suitable for injection moulding may beused directly or may be blended with pellets of otherthermoplastics products. These other products may be ofthe same polymer but having higher molecular weight or maybe of a different polymer providing that the presence ofthe different polymer does not adversely affect theoverall balance of properties of the composition. Theother products may be an unfilled polymer or may contain aparticulate or fibrous filler. Blends with materialscontaining the conventionally produced reinforced mouldingpowders, that is moulding powders with reinforcing fibresup to about 0.25 mm long are particularly suitable because the overall reinforcing fibre content of the blend can bekept high to produce maximum strength even though theshorter reinforcing fibres do not contribute soeffectively as the long fibres present from the product ofthe present invention. The chopped form of the continuous pultrusion is alsovery useful as a feedstock for a method in which a fibre reinforcedshaped article is produced by extruding acomposition comprising a settable fluid as a carrier forfibres at least 5 mm in length through a die so thatrelaxation of the fibres causes the extrudate to expand toform an open fibrous structure containing randomlydispersed fibre as the extrudate leaves the die andcompressing the porous structure produced whilst thecarrier is in a fluid condition into a shaped article. By settable is meant that the fluid may be set into such a form that it holds the fibre in the randomorientation, which occurs on extrusion. Thus, forexample, the settable fluid may be a molten thermoplasticsmaterial which is extruded in its molten state and thenset by cooling until it freezes. Preferably the expanded extrudate is extrudeddirectly into a mould chamber provided with means forcompressing the porous extrudate into a shaped article andthe extrudate is compressed into a shaped article beforethe extrudate is caused or allowed to set. The extrudate formed in the process contains randomlydispersed fibres so that the only orientation of fibres inthe shaped article is that which might arise as a resultof the compression process. The process can be used at high fibre loadings, thatis in excess of 30 by volume of fibre. Little fibrebreakage occurs in the process so that shaped articles ofexceptionally high strength measured in all directions inthe article can be obtained. Pellets obtained by chopping the pultruded product ofthe present invention into lengths of at least 5 mm andpreferably at least 10 mm are preferred. The upper limitis determined by the extent of the problems encountered infeeding material to the extruder which will melt theproduct. Lengths at least up to 50 mm can be employedalthough with long lengths the amount of fibre breakageincreases so that the benefit of long fibre length ispartially eroded. When the relatively lowmolecular weight polymers, for example polymers having amelt viscosity below 30 Ns m The invention is further illustrated with referenceto the following examples. Copolymers of polyethylene terephthalate in which 20 by weight of the terephthalic acid had been replaced byisophthalic acid and having the intrinsic viscosity valueslisted in Table 1 were used to prepare polymer melts in abath at a temperature of approximately 290 C. A glassroving containing 16000 individual filaments was pulled through the molten polymer over one spreader bar situatedin the bath at a rate of 30 cm minute giving a dwell timein the bath of 30 seconds. The impregnated roving waspulled through a 3 mm diameter die in the wall of the bathand then cooled. The viscosity of the melt and the intrinsic viscosityof the polymer feedstock and the polymer in the reinforcedcomposition were measured. The extent of the wetting ofthe fibres and the void content were assessed by comparingthe weight of a completely wetted length of impregnatedproduct with the same length of product with an unknownextent of wetting. The completely wetted control materialis obtained by operating the pultrusion process at a veryslow rate with a low viscosity melt so that a completelytransparent product is obtained. Thus the completelywetted standard is taken to be a sample which istransparent and which has been prepared under conditionswhich optimise the parameters favourable to wetting. Theextent of wetting values given in the table are derivedfrom the relationship The strength of the product was assessed by measuringthe force required to break a specimen of the 3 mm rod inflexure placed across a 64 mm span. The results obtained are given in Table 1. The polymer used in Example 1 having an intrinsicviscosity of 0.45 dl g was evaluated over a range of melttemperatures and haul through rates. The results obtainedare recorded below in Table 2. A PET homopolymer having a melt viscosity at 280 C of6 Ns m These results indicate an approximate plateau inmodulus and strength in the region 50 to 65 glass byweight . Conventional grades of polypropylene have viscositiesat low shear rates in excess of 100 Ns m A sample of Victrex polyethersulphone having an RVof 0.3 was pultruded with the glass fibre used inExample 3 at 405 C at 21 cm minute using a single spreaderbar having a melt viscosity of 30 Ns m The wetting of the rovings is clearly influenced bythe number of spreader bars, and for the same operatingconditions an increase in line speed can be effected byincreasing the number of spreaders for any degree ofwetting. The glass fibre used in Example 3 was pultruded at280 C with PET homopolymer using a single spreader and aspeed of 20 cm minute to give a totally wetted product transparent . The dwell time in the bath under theseconditions was about 30 seconds. The use of threespreaders allowed an increase in line speed to120 cm minute for a transparent well wetted pultrusion.The dwell time under these conditions was about 10seconds. A number of polymers were used according to thegeneral procedure of Example 1 to produce pultrudedsections from a glass roving containing 16000 filaments.The roving was pulled through molten polymer over onespreader bar at a rate of 15 cm minute to give a productcontaining about 65 by weight of glass in each case. Thepolymers used, the melt temperatures employed, the meltviscosities at those temperatures and the propertiesobtained are detailed in Table 4. In the case of the polyethylene terephthalate thepull through speed was increased above 15 cm mm to examinethe effect of void content on physical properties.Table 5 below records properties measured on the 3 mmdiameter rod produced. These indicate that a void contentof less than about 5 gives superior properties. A sample of carbon fibre reinforced polyetherketonewas prepared by pulling a carbon fibre tape containing6000 individual filaments through a bath of moltenpolyetherketone at a temperature of 400 C at a speed of25 cm minute. A product having a flexural modulus of80 GN M This example illustrates how the mechanicalproperties of pultrusions vary with the volume fraction offibre and with the resin type. The samples are comparedat fixed volume concentration. The low flexural strengthof the composites based on polypropylene is a reflectionof the tendency for less stiff resins to fail in a compressive mode. Polypropylene resin has a modulus ofabout 1 GN m A rod of 65 by weight glass fibre in PET was choppedto 1 cm lengths and diluted on a 50 50 basis with normallycompounded material containing 30 by weight of shortglass fibre in PET. This mixture was injection mouldedusing normal technology to give ASTM bars having thefollowing properties in comparison with normallycompounded material containing 50 by weight of glassfibre in PET. Various Examples of pultruded materials including PETwith 60 by weight of glass fibre and PEEK containing 60 by weight of carbon fibre were chopped to 1 cm length andmoulded using the method described in European PatentPublication No. 56702 in which an expanded reinforcedmaterial is produced by extrusion through a die of shortlength, preferably of zero length, and is subsequentlycompression moulded to give three dimensional shapedarticles containing 60 by weight of long fibre. Pultruded material is especially suitable for thisapplication because the high level of wetting obtainedeffectively protects the fibres and reduces the attritionbetween them which causes fibre breakdown. Blends were made of conventional glass filled PET short fibre compounded material prepared by extrusioncompounding with PET of IV 0.75 and chopped 10 mm pultrusions prepared according to Example 3 . Theseblends were injection moulded to give discs 114 mmdiameter and 3 mm thick filled from a rectangular sidegate 1.5 mm thick by 10 mm wide. These samples weresubjected to impact in an instrumented falling weightimpact test and the failure energy noted. All samples filled the mould with similar ease. Thisis because the polymer used to prepared the pultrusionsamples was of lower molecular weight than that used toprepare the short fibre compound and this lower molecularpolymer offset the increased resistance to flow due to thelong fibre. The results clearly indicate increased failure energyfor the long fibre filled material despite the lowermolecular weight of the polymer which would normally beexpected to contribute to brittleness. Note especiallythe comparison between tests No. 2 and No. 4 and the sametotal weight percentage of fibres. We further noted that whereas the short fibremouldings splintered on impact allowing pieces of sharpplastic to fly off when more than half the weight fraction was of long fibres the mouldings failed in a safe mannerall broken pieces remaining attached to the main part. Ashing the mouldings after test revealed that much ofthe long fibre glass had retained most of its originallength. Considerably more than 50 by weight of theoriginal long fibres in the mouldings were more than 3 mmlong. The samples were also assessed for flexural modulus,anisotropy ratio, Izod impact strength and IV of thepolymer in the mouldings. The values in the table belowindicate reduced anisotropy and good notched impactrelative to short fibre products. 14 tapes of continuous carbon fibres supplied byCourtaulds Ltd and designated XAS carbon fibres , eachcontaining 6000 individual filaments were drawn at a rateof 25 cm minute over a series of stationary guide bars toprovide a band of width about 50 mm having a tension ofabout 100 lbs. When the fibres had been guided into contiguous relationship they were pulled over a singlefixed heated cylindrical bar of 12.5 mm diameter. Thetemperature of the bar was maintained at about 380 C. Apowder of polyetheretherketone having a melt viscosity of20 Ns m The procedure of Example 13 was used with apolyethersulphone having a melt viscosity of 3 Ns m The procedure of Example 29 was used with thecommercially available polyethersulphone PES 200P available from Imperial Chemical Industries PLC having aviscosity of 800 Ns m The general procedure of Example 13 was followed toproduce an impregnated sheet using 14 tapes of continuouscarbon fibres Courtaulds XAS, 6K tow and polyetheretherketone having a melt viscosity of 30 Ns m The tape described in Example 16 was cut to lengthsof 150 mm and stacked in a matched die compressionmoulding tool. This tool was heated to 380 C, in aconventional laboratory press, and compressed so that themoulding was subjected to a pressure of between 2 and 5 x10 Mouldings ranging in thickness from 0.5 mm 4 plies to 4 mm 38 plies were formed in this way. During themoulding operation a small amount of polymer was squeezedout of the mould as flash so that the mouldings contained62 by weight of carbon fibre by comparison with 60 byweight in the original tape. The mouldings were then cut using a diamond waferingsaw to give specimens suitable for mechanical testing byflexural techniques. The following results wereobtained Using the same equipment as Example 16 some poorlywetted tapes were produced by starving some sections ofthe tape while flood feeding others. The overall fibrecontent of the tape was the same as in Example 4 but manyloose fibres were apparent on the surface of the tapeswhile other areas were rich in resin. These tapes were stacked and moulded as described inExample 17 taking care that poorly wetted regions of onetape were placed adjacent to resin rich areas in the nexttape. Visual inspection of the mouldings showed thatsubstantial unwetted areas remained and loose fibres couldeasily be pulled from the surface. The mechanicalproperties of these mouldings was inferior to those notedin Example 33 and in particular the interlaminar shearstrength was variable and low, values of 10 MN m This Example illustrates that fibre wetting takesplace primarily at the impregnation stage and not duringthe secondary, moulding, stage. It is, however, believedthat some wetting could be achieved by this secondarystage if higher pressures and longer dwell times wereemployed. Carbon fibre Celion 6K and 3K tows wereimpregnated with a thermotropic polyester containingresidues of hydroxynaphthoic acid, terephthalic acid andhydroquinone having a melt viscosity at 320 C of7 Ns m Various pieces of scrap material produced fromworking Examples 16 to 18 including some material withexcess resin were broken up and fed to a conventionalscrew extruder and compounded to form granules. Thegranules contained carbon fibres which were up to 0.25 mmlong. These granules were injection moulded usingconventional moulding technology under normal operatingconditions for filled PEEK. The mouldings had thefollowing properties by comparison with the best availablecommercial grade of carbon fibre filled PEEK prepared byconventional compounding operations This Example illustrates that the product of thisinvention is capable of being converted to a product forconventionaa processing which is in some way superior tothat available by present technology. Also the scrap fromvarious long fibre operations such as sheet preparation,lamination, filament winding etc can be reclaimed to give a high performance material. The characteristic ofreclaimability is of great economic significance whenworking with expensive raw materials such as carbonfibre. The optimum tensions in rovings when operatingaccording to the method of Example 31 were determined bymeasuring the tension before impregnation and at the haul offstage in an individual roving containing 6000filaments 14 rovings were used in Example 29 and theoperating tension will in practice be 14 times the valuesgiven below . The values quoted below were judged to bethe minimum operation tension Case 1 and the maximumoperating tension Case 2 for the particular rovings,polymer type and equipment used. With tension valuesbelow those of Case 1 there was a tendency formisalignment of fibres and splits in the tape produced.With tension values above those of Case 2 increased fibreattrition was observed with loose fibres accumulating onthe band. For a different set of conditions rovings,polymer type etc the values obtained wwll be different butcan be readily optimised to produce a good qualityproduct.
