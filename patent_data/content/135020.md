# Magnetic recording disks.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording disk substrate is provided with a capacitive servo pattern by implanting dopant material in the substrate to modify the substrate conductivity in a desired servo pattern. The specification describes a recording disk comprising a flat semiconductor substrate 11 carrying a magnetic recording layer 12 on its surface. The substrate has doped areas 11a in its coated surface which form a servo pattern. The dopant modifies the conductivity or permitivity of the doped areas and this can be capacitively C sensed 13 and followed.
