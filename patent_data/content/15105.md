# Plaster cast.

## Abstract
A support or cast 1 for immobilising broken limbs 3 is disclosed. The cast 1 is formed from an inner air permeable layer, for example lint, and an outer rigid casing 9 . Tubes 4 with spaced apertures opening onto the inner layer are located between the inner and outer layers. Preferably air is pumped into the tubes 4 to pass into the inner layer and thence out of the support 1 . Such ventilation prevents dis comfort and itching.
