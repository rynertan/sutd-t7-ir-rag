## Description
VIDEO DISC TYPE RECORDING AND REPRODUCING SYSTEM The present invention relates to a video disc type recording and reproducing system with multiplexed video and audio signals, and, more particularly, to such a system in which interference between sidebands of the frequency modulated video signal and the frequencymodulated audio signal is eliminated. A video disc type recording and reproducing system typically comprises recording means and reproducing means the recording means comprising a first frequency modulator for modulating a video signal, a second frequency modulator for modulating an audio signal, an adder circuit for adding the modulated video and audio signals, a limiter connected to an output of the adder circuit for pulse width modulating the output signal from the adder circuit, and an electrical optical modulator connected to the limiter. According to this invention such a system is modified by introducing filter means connected between an output of the first frequency modulator and the adder circuit for removing a frequency component of the frequency modulated video signal which covers a frequency component of the frequency modulated audio signal from the second frequency modulator to prevent second and higher order sidebands of the modulated video signal interfering with the audio signal multiplexed with it. Preferably the lower one of the secondary sidebands of the video RF signal, which overlaps the audio carrier frequencies, is removed by the filter means so that the audio signals are not influenced thereby. The elimination of the secondary or higher order sidebands of the video signal does not affect reproduction of the video signal since the frequency range necessary to reproduce the video signal spans only the primary sideband. Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described and contrasted with the prior art with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram of a typical conventional video disc type recording and reproducing system Figure 2a shows the frequency spectrum of frequencymodulated video and audio signals Figure 2b shows the frequency spectrum obtained with the present invention Figure 3 is block diagram of a first embodiment of the recording system of the present invention Figure 4 is a characteristic curve of a band eliminating filter used in the first embodiment Figure 5 is a block diagram of a second embodiment of the present invention Figure 6 is a characteristic curve of a compensating circuit used in the second embodiment Figure 7 is a third embodiment of the present invention Figure 8 is the frequency spectrum of frequencymodulated video and audio signals in the third embodiment Figure 9 shows waveforms at various portions of the third example of reproducing system Figure 10 is an embodiment of the reproducing system of the present invention and, Figure 11 is another embodiment of the reproducing system of the present invention. Systems in which video information as well as audio information is recorded on a video disc and are simultaneously reproduced are known, and an example thereof is shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1 a video carrier of, for example, 8.2 MHz is frequency modulated with the video information by a frequency modulator 1 so that the sync level, the pedestal level and the white peak level thereof become, for example, 7.6 MHz, 8.1 MHz and 9.3 MHz, respectively. At least one audio signal is also frequencymodulated by a frequency modulator 2, and outputs of the frequency modulators 1 and 2 are added by an adder circuit 3. An output of the adder circuit 3 is supplied to a limiter 4 by which an amplitude of the adder output is limited, and pulse width modulation is performed. An output of the limiter is supplied to an electrical optical E O modulator 5 in which a laser beam from a laser source 6 is modulated by the limiter output, and the resultant signal is recorded on a video disc 7 in a known manner. Upon reproduction, the recorded information is picked up by a pick up 8 and amplified by an amplifier 9. An output of the amplifier 9 is suitably divided and the resultant video and audio information are detected by detectors 10 and 11, respectively. Figure 2a shows an example of the frequency spectrum of the output of the limiter 4. In Figure 2a letterA represents the frequency band of the frequency modulated video signal, B1 and B2 are the primary sidebands thereof and C1 and C2 are the secondary sidebands thereof.D and E are audio signal carriers when the audio system is a 2 channel or bilingual system. The frequency band width necessary to demodulate the video signal is from 3.9 to 13.5 MHz in the NTSC system in which the primary sidebands are included, because the modulation index is unity or smaller. Therefore, it is usual to set the audio subcarriers at, for example, 2.3 MHz and 2.8 MHz, so that these frequencies are out of the above frequency band necessary for video signal demodulation. When the video input is composed of a ramp signal combined with a Y brightness component, the secondary sideband of the Y component is from 2.6 to 3.5 MHz, which covers at least a portion of the audio subcarriers. Although the level of the secondary sideband of the video RF signal is lower than that of the primary sideband, it still affects the audio subcarriers, because the level of the audio subcarriers is usually set at around one tenth the video carrier level, and may be further lowered by 6 dB by passage through the limiter 4. Therefore the carrier to noise ratio C N of the frequency modulated audio signal is degraded, resulting in a degraded S N ratio and reproduction quality. Further, in a four channel audio system, a subcarrier of, for example, 47.2 KHz is frequency modulated with audio signals from 2 additional channels, respectively, and these frequency modulated subcarriers are added to the main channel signals. Then the main carriers of 2.3 MHz and 2.8 MHz are frequency modulated with the resultant signals, respectively. In this case the effect of the secondary and or higher sidebands of the frequency modulated video signal on the audio signals becomes more severe. Further, since the dynamic range of the audio information in the conventional video disc type recording and reproducing system, in which an analogue audio signal is directly frequency modulated, is as small as 60 65 dB, it is relatively difficult to obtain a high quality reproduction signal. In Figure 3 the recording system according to the present invention differs from the conventional system in Figure 1 in that a band eliminating filter BEF 8a is provided between the video frequency modulator 1 and adder 3. Reference numerals 2 and 2a represent respective frequency modulators for the two audio signals.The BEF 8a has band eliminating characteristics such as shown by a curve Sl in Figure 4. That is, the BEF 8a prevents or at least restricts passage of a frequency range from about 2 MHz to about 3 MHz, so that at least the lower of the secondary sidebands C1 Figure 2 of the video signal is eliminated as shown in Figure 2b. In this case, the video RF signal may be distorted in either amplitude or phase or both due to the existence of the filter 8a. That is, the BEF may exhibit group delay characteristics as shown by a chain line G1 in Figure 4, which causes the deformation of the demodulated video signal.In order to eliminate this problem, it is possible to use a notch filter as the filter 8a, or further connect a group delay compensation circuit 9a to the output of the BEF 8a as shown in Figure 5. The compensating circuit 9a has a constant gain S2 and group delay characteristics as shown by a chain line G2 in Figure 6, which compensates for the group delay characteristics Sl of the BEF 8. Alternatively it is possible to vary the attenuation of the BEF 8a in proportion to the amount of high harmonies of the video RF signal falling in the audio RF range, so that control of the attenuation of theBEF can be performed according to a disturbance of the audio RF signal due to the video RF signal. Figure 7 shows another embodiment of the present invention which differs from the system in Figure 3 in that a digital encoder 10 is provided. The encoder 10 has an input to which the audio signal is supplied.An output of the encoder 10 is connected to the adder 4. In this case, the two audio signals supplied to the respective frequency modulators 2 and 2a are also supplied to the digital encoder 10 and digitised in a time sharing manner using a suitable modulation system such as pulse code modulation PCM , to convert them into a series of pulses which are then added in the adder 4 to the outputs of modulator 2 and 2a. In this case, the eight to fourteen moedulation EFM system may be used. In such case, the frequency spectrum of the digital format includes pulses having widths of 3T to llT when T is the bit period of the PCM signal.That is, 3T corresponds to about 720 KHz, 4T to about 540 KHz and llT to about 200 KHz. These pulses are limited in level to about one tenth the level of the video main carrier and are added to the outputs of the filter 8a and the modulators 2 and 3a. The filter 8a may be a high pass filter HPF or a band pass filter BPF . The resultant composite signal from the limiter 4 is cut around the zero crossing level and amplified to obtain a pulse width modulated signal. Figure 8 shows the frequency spectrum at the output of the adder 3 in which at the lower end is the spectrum F of the digital audio signal component. Figure 9 shows the waveforms at various points in the system of Figure 7, in which Figure 9a is the output waveform of the band pass filter 8a, Figure 9b is an audio output from one of the modulators 2 and 3a,Figure 9c is the waveform of the output of the digital encoder 10, Figure 9d is a composite waveform of the output of the adder 3 and Figure 9e is the pulse width modulated output of the limiter 4. In Figure 9c, the output waveform of the digital encoder 10 theoretically takes a step form as shown by the dotted line. However, due to restrictions in the frequency characteristics of the associated circuits, the waveform becomes more as shown by the solid line, in practice, the waveform in Figure 9e is obtained by cutting the waveform in Figure 9d at around the zero crossing levels and amplifying the resulting waveform, or by using a zero level comparator. It is possible to make the dynamic range of the digitised audio information about 90dB or more, and thus the sound quality can be much improved as cowared with recording using direct frequency modulation. In this embodiment, since both the directly frequencymodulated signal and the PCM signal are recorded together with the video signal, either of audio signals can be selectively reproduced. Figure 10 is a reproducing system suitable for the recording system of Figure 3. In Figure 10 the readoutRF signal from a pick up 8 is amplified by an amplifier 9 and supplied to a video band pass filter 13, an audio low pass filter 14 and a low pass filter 15. An output of the band pass filter 13 is supplied to a video detector 16 and demodulated thereby. An output of the low pass filter 14, which passes frequency components lower than 2.8 mHz is supplied to a band pass filter 17, which passes only the audio carrier, and the carrier component is detected by a detector 18. An output of the low pass. filter 15, which passes only the digital audio information, is supplied to a decoder 19 and decoded thereby to form an audio signal. Figure 11 shows, in block diagram another embodiment of the reproducing system according to the present invention, which is suitable for use with the recording system of Figure 7. In Figure 11, the output of the amplifier 9 is supplied to a low pass filter 15, to derive only the digital audio component F of Figure 8, and an output of the filter 15 is decoded by a decoder 19. As mentioned with reference to Figure 7, the two audio signals are both FM processed and PCM processed.That is, the signal picked up by the pick up 8 contains the FM processed video signal, the FM processed audio signals and the PCM processed, time shared, audio signals.The picked up signal is amplified by the amplifier 9 and supplied to the video band pass filter 13, the audio low pass filter 14 and the low pass filter 15, by which frequency ranges covering the secondary and higher order sidebands of the video signal are removed. An output of the video band pass filter 13 is demodulated by the detector 16 to provide a video output as in the embodiment of Figure 10. The audio signal component of the signal supplied from the amplifier 9 to the audio low pass filter 14 is passed through the latter and supplied to band pass filters 17R and 17L. The filter 17L is designed to pass the frequency band centered at, for example, 2.3 MHz, and the filter 17R is designed to pass the frequency band centered at 2.8 MHz.Therefore the frequency band centered at 2.3 MHz is demodulated by detector 18L to provide a L channel audio output, and in a similar manner to the frequency band centered at 2.8 MHz is passed through the band pass filter 17R and demodulated by detector 18R to provide an R channel audio output. The signal supplied to the low pass filter 15 is rejected, except for the frequency band covering the frequency spectrum F composed of the time shared PCM components shown in Figure 8. Therefore, the frequency component F is supplied to the decoder 19 and decoded separately to provide L channel and R channel outputs. The L and R channel outputs from the detectors 18L and 18R and the L and R channel outputs from the decoder 19 are selectable by means of a pair of switches 20 and 21. Each of the switches 20 and 21 has a pair of contacts, one contact of which is connected to the outputs of the detectors 18L and 18R, respectively, and the other contact of which is connected to the outputs of the decoder 19. Therefore, by operating the switches 20, 21, it is possible to derive L and R channel audio outputs from either the detectors 18L and 18R or the decoder 19.
