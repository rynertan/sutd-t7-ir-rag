# Method of making an edible fat product.

## Abstract
Edible fat products are prepared from triglyceride oils having high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low levels of saturated fatty acids. These products are useful in the preparation of both tub and stick mar garines. A process is disclosed wherein a liquid tri glyceride oil is interesterified to increase the quantity of solid triglycerides, the reaction mixture is then cooled to form a liquid fraction and solid fraction, removing a portion of the liquid fraction, adding additional triglyceride oil, and then continuing the interesterification under conditions of time and temperature cycling effective to direct the interesterification toward the production of increased solid triglycerides. Preferably, oils such as corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, and safflower oil can be fortified with sufficient solids, without the ad dition of hydrogenated hardstock, to form margarines of suitable consistency.
