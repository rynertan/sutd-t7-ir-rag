# Thermosettable polyesters, powder coating compositions containing them and coated substrates.

## Abstract
Thermosettable polyester resin compositions, suitable for use in powder coating applications are derived from a polymerization reaction mixture comprising a dicarboxylic aromatic component e.g., 1,4 benzenedicarboxylic acid , a trihydroxy alkyl component e.g., 2 ethyl 2 hydroxymethyl 1,3 propanediol , a diol component e.g., 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propanediol and a dihydroxy alkyl compound having 4 to 10 carbon atoms in the primary carbon chain between the hydroxyl moieties e.g., 1,6 hexanediol . Polyesters of the present invention have a number average molecular weight of from about 2,000 to about 6,000, a combined acid and hydroxyl number of from 35 to 70 milligrams of KOH per gram of polyester, and a glass transition temperature of from 35 C to 50 .
