# Electrical reactor with foil windings.

## Abstract
An iron core shunt reactor for power factor improvement of transmission lines is constructed of a plurality of foil wind ings 24 33 coaxially positioned along an iron core 36 a discrete distance from each other. A coolant circulates axially along the core and radially outward 38 46 between each of the foil windings providing the shunt reactor with improved thermal characteristics. The foil windings are all connected in parallel to form a neutral terminal and a line terminal. The foil winding s at the line terminal may have the foil width gradu ally decreasing as the winding progresses radially away from the winding axis so as to give a rounding off effect to the outer periphery of the winding, to obviate the corona. The wind ing s at the line end may additionally be encapsulated in an epoxy resin. This construction offers reduced electromagne tic forces on the windings, and improved thermal as well as impulse distribution characteristics.
