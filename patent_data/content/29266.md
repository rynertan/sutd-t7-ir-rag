# Magnet system for an electroacoustic transducer.

## Abstract
An elelctroacoustic transducer oomprising a dia phragm provided with conductors and magnetic zones at both sides of the diaphragm 5 for producing an energiz ing field at the location of the conductors 6 . At the boundary areas of the magnetic zones 1, 2 2, 3 3, 4 auxiliary fields are produced in order to reduce stray fields at the location of the boundary areas 1, 2 2, 3 3, 4 . This results in a better concentration of the energizing magnetic fields in the plane of the diaphragm 5 , so that a stronger magnetic field is obtained at the location of the conductors 6 .
