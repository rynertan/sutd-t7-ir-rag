# Luminescent screen.

## Abstract
A luminescent screen provided with a luminescent layer 4 disposed on a support 1 and containing an alkaline earth metal aluminate activated by bivalent europium. The alkaline earth metal is barium which may be replaced up to 25 mol. by strontium. The aluminate has a crystal structure, the X ray powder diagram of which corresponds or substantially corresponds to the diagram given in Table I of the descrip tion, whilst the ratio of alkaline earth metal to aluminium in the aluminate has a value of 1 5 to 1 10. An advantageous use of such a luminescent screen is found in low pressure mercury vapour discharge lamps.
