# Word line selection in a semi conductor memory device.

## Abstract
A memory device operable at high speed is disclosed. The device comprises selection means WD coupled to word lines WL for selecting one of them, detection means WDT for detecting a signal appearing in the selected word line, and word line drive means WDR responsive to an output of the detection means for supplying the selected word line with a voltage capable of introducing a selection level in it independent on the selection means.
