# Heat exchanger with tube cleaning element capturing cage interconnection.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger has a plurality of fluid flow tubes 5 secured adjacent their ends by tube sheets 6, 7 . Cleaning elements, such as brushes 17 , are adapted to shuttle back and forth in the tubes. Cleaning element capturing cages or baskets 18 are mounted to the tube ends. When the tube ends are of varying diameters along the plane of a tube sheet, some baskets 18a are press fit into the larger diameter tube ends 26a and an adhesive 28 used to rigidly secure the members together. In addition, other baskets 18b are loosely slipped over the smaller diameter tube ends 26b . However, it is not necessary to rigidly fix these latter baskets in place. Instead, a connector device 29 joins baskets which are not rigidly fixed against axial movement to those that are, so that the latter support the former in rigid interconnecting relation ship. If the tube ends are all of the same diameter, only some of the baskets need be rigidly secured to the tube ends, with the other baskets interconnected thereto by connectors as described above.
