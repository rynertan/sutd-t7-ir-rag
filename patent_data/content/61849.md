# Disc brake actuator.

## Abstract
For the pneumatic actuation of a multi disc brake, plungers 27 which are distributed circumferentially around the thrust ring not shown of the disc pack are paired and each pair is driven in the brake application direction by a common pneumatic actuator 29 . Thrust is transmitted from each actuator 29 to the associated pair of plungers 27 by a respective pair of transmission elements 30 each of which moves at right angles to the associated actuator 29 and plungers 27 , each element 30 having at its opposite ends ball and ramp formations 35 36 37 39 41 40 with taper angles of less than 45 such that the travel of each element 30 is less than that of the associated actuator 29 and the travel of each plunger 27 is less than that of the associated element 30 but the force applied by each actuator 29 to the associated pair of plungers 27 has twice been multiplied.
