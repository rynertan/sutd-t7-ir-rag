# Method of forming a glass spacer in the magnetic gap of a magnetic head.

## Abstract
In a method of making a magnetic gap by depositing a glass layer on a surface of a magnetic head element by cathodic sputtering of a glass target and cementing the resulting glass coated magnetic head element to a similar element or an uncoated magnetic head element, the thick ness of the sputtered glass layer is monitored by an inter ference of a light beam 31 guided on a surface of the magnetic head element 32 during deposition, using a sputtering apparatus having a sample holder 33 beside the sputtering target for securing the magnetic head ele ment 32 and a mask plate 37 for achieving uniform thickness of sputtered glass layer s . The magnetic head produced has excellent electromagnetic conversion char acteristics and high accuracy.
