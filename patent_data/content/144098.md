The compounds I of the present invention may be applied as a selective or non selective herbicide for crop lands, e.g. plowed fields, orchards, tea plantations, mulbcrr fields, fallow lands and pastures or non crop lands, e.g., railbeds, roads, lawns, factory sites, dry riverbeds, residential quarters, park green districts, forest lands, prepared lands and vacant lands. Furthermore, the compounds I of the present invention are harmless and safe to the human, domestic animals, and birds or poultry, and show a very low toxicity to fishes, shells and the like. Consequently, the herbicides of this invention are quite safe ones and therefore there is no problem about the residual toxicity in soil. The present compounds I each may be used in combination with known herbicides such as diuron, atrazine, prometryns alachlor and trifluralin for the purpose of extending its herbicidal spectrum and getting an additional or synergistic herbicidal effect. The herbicides of the present invention may be applied over the soil such as sandy soil and clay soil as well as the ordinary soil such as sandy loam soil and loamy soilThey may be applied even to one of clay soil, i.e., montmorillonite soil which occasionally has an influence on the occurrence of the herbicidal activity. The herbicides of the present invention, i e. cyclic ureas of isoxazole I , may suitably be used in combination with a customary solid or liquid carrier or carriers, if desired, together with additional adjutants e.g.emulsifiers, stabilizers, dispersants, suspending agents, spreaders, penetrants, wetting agents in order to formulate more refined formulations e.g. emulsions, wettable powders, granules, dusts, pellets . Representatives of the carriers are solid carriers e.g. clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, bentonite , liquid carriers e.g. water, alcohols, acetone, benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha, cyclohexane and the like. The herbicide formulations of this invention may be used in combination with other agricultural chemicals e.g. insecticides, fungicides or other herbicides , manuring ingredients e.g. ammonium sulfate, urea or soil treating agents.

After sowing, the seeds were covered with sandy loam and an aqueous suspension green 20 was used at a concentration of 100 ppm as a spreader. of the test compound was applied over the surface of the sandy loam. The suspension of the test compound was prepared by dilution with water at a concentration of 20g lOL, lOg lOL, 5g lOL or 2.5g lOL and applied at a rate of lOL are with an automatic metal sprayer. The pots were kept at a temperature of 25 C in a greenhouse under the natural sunlight.b Method of evaluation The outward change of the seeds or plants was checked by eye observation at prefixed intervals , and after four weeks the evaluation was made on the following six degrees according to the degree of damages to the plant.

Especially, no damages were observed in the tests with the compounds Nos. 24. 61 and 64 for corn, the compound No.61 for wheat and soa ean, and the compound No.4 for cotton and tomato, so they are very hopeful selective herbicides applicable to the field of the above specified crop plants, respectively. Additionally, the compounds other than the above specified are also useful as non selective herbicides. The formulations of the herbicides of the present invention are illustrated as follows.Formulation 1 Ten parts by weight of 3 3 t butyl 5 isoxazolyl I methyl 2 imidazolidinone and 90 parts by weight of dust talc are mixed up uniformly to give a dust. Formulation 2 Twenty parts by weight of 1 methyl 3 5 isopropyl 3 isoxazolyl 4 methoxycarbonyloxy 2 imidazolidinone, 50 parts b weight of clay, 25 parts by weight of talc and 5 parts b weight of Emal Registered trademark, Kao Soap Co. as a spreader are mixed to give a wettable powder.Formulation 3 To a solution of 20 parts be weight of 3 3 t butyl5 isoxazolyl 1 methyl 5 methoxycarbonyloxy 2 imidazolidinone in 65 parts b weight of dimethylformamide are added 15 parts by weight of Sorpol Registered trademark, Toho Chemical Ind. to give an emulsion.
