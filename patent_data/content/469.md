# Film cartridge and apparatus for processing the self developing film strip contained therein.

## Abstract
A photographic film assemblage 10 of the self developing type is specially configured for use in conventional cameras including those of the 35 mm type. Photographic processing apparatus 11 is provided for use in conjunction with the self developing type film assemblages 10 which have been previously exposed by the conventional type camera. The film assemblages 10 comprise a substantially lighttight cartridge 34 into which the film strip may be rewound subsequent to exposure in the conventional type camera thereby facilitating its removal from the camera and its insertion into the processing apparatus 11 which operates again to withdraw the film strip from its cartridge so as to effect the processing of the film strip. After processing, the film strip is advanced from the processing apparatus to provide a plurality of fully developed transparencies which may be cut and framed in a conventional manner.
