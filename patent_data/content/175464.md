## Description
This invention relates to Benzimidazole derivatives useful as e.g. anti ulcer agents and to a method of preparing them. As the benzimidazole derivatives having anti ulcer activity, those disclosed in e.g. US A 4,255,431 Japanese Unexamined Patent Laid open No. 141783 79 and US A 4,472,409 Japanese Unexamined Patent Laid open No. 135881 83 have been known. However, while these known compounds have an acid secretion inhibiting action, their gastric mucous membrane protecting action is insufficient, thus being hardly considered satisfactory as anti ulcer agents. Besides, these compounds are possessed of such drawbacks in the physico chemical properties as being unstable and readily decomposed. GB A 2 134 523 discloses benzimidazole derivatives which can be used in the prevention and treatment of peptic ulcers. It is considered that gastrointestinal ulcer is induced by unbalance between aggressive factors, e.g. hydrochloric acid and pepsin, and defensive factors, e.g. mucus secretion and mucosal blood flow. Therefore, a medicine having both an action of inhibiting gastric acid secretion and an action of enhancing protection of gastric mucosa has been desired. The present inventors diligently studied with the purpose of preparing an anti ulcer agent having excellent actions of inhibiting gastric acid secretion, of protecting gastric mucosa and of anti ulceration. They found that a certain type of benzimidazole derivatives meet the said purpose, and they conducted further study to accomplish the present invention.

Pharmacological actions of the compounds of the present invention are described as follows. While the role of acid in causing gastric and duodenal ulcerations has been well known, importance of the protecting ability of gastric mucosa has been attracting the attention in recent years. Miller T. A., Am. J. Physiol., Male Sprague Dawley rats of 7 weeks old were fasted for 24 hours. These animals were administered test compounds into stomach by using a gastric tube. After 30 minutes, 1 ml of 100 ethanol was administered orally. The animals were killed by carbon dioxide gas 60 minutes after ethanol administration. The stomach was removed together with the lower part of esophagus and the duodenum. The esophagus was clipped, 10 ml of 1 formalin solution was instilled into the stomach from the duodenum, and then the duodenum was clipped. The whole stomach was immersed in 1 formalin solution. About 15 minutes later, the stomachs were opened along the greater curvature. Length of the lesions occurred in the gastric antral mucosa was measured under a dissecting microscope with a square grid eye piece x10 . The sum total length of the individual lesions in each animal was measured, and the average value per group was calculated. Based on the difference between the average value of each group and that of the control group, the inhibition rate was determined. The test compound was suspended in a 5 gum arabic solution, and administered in a volume of 2 ml kg. As shown by the above data, the compounds of this invention have an evidently superior action of protecting gastric mucosa as compared with known compounds. Besides, the compound I of this invention shows excellent actions of inhibiting gastric acid secretion, protecting gastric mucous membrane and preventing ulceration. Stating about the toxicity of the compound I of this invention, oral administration of the compound employed for the experiment of an action protecting gastric mucous membrance compound of R¹ H, R² H, R³ CH₂ ₂CH₃ to mice even in a dose of 500 mg kg caused no fatal effect, thus the compound I generally being low in toxicity. As described in the foregoing, the compound I of this invention has an anti ulcer action, a gastric acid secretion controlling action and a mucous membrane protecting action, furthermore is of low toxicity and is relatively stable as a chemical substance. The compound I of this invention can thus be used for prophylaxis and therapy of digestive ulcers e.g. gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer and gastritis in mammalian animals e.g. mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, cat and man . When the compound I of this invention is used as an anti ulcer agent for the therapy of digestive ulcers in mammalian animals, it can be administered orally in a dosage form of capsules, tablets, granules, etc. by formulating with a pharmacologically acceptable carrier, excipient, diluent, etc. The dose is about 0.01 30 mg kg day, more preferably about 0.1 3 mg kg day.
