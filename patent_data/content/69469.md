# Apparatus for speed detection.

## Abstract
An apparatus for detecting the speed of an AC motor 1101 such as a synchronous motor or induction motor of the type in which a pulse generator 1102 is connected to the shaft of the motor for producing pulses Pn, Pr indicative of the motor speed. The motor speed is detected by counting clock pulses whenever the pulses Pn, Pr are generated by the pulse generator 1102 . Provided are speed computing means 1400 responsive to an interrupt pulse ITP of a constant period for estimating the present actual speed of the motor 1101 , as times between pulses from the pulse generator 1102 , on the basis of the magnitude of the magnitude of a previously commanded armature voltage, magnitude of past and present current and a past detected speed, in accordance with the characteristics of the motor 1101 . The estimated speed is taken as the detected speed to enable the speed of the motor 1101 to be detected with improved accuracy.
