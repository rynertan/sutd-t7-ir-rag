# Ultrasonic wave tomographic imaging system.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic wave tomographic imaging system incor porating ultrasonic wave transducer means 23 for radiating signals into an object and for receiving signals from the object via an ultrasonic wave lens 22 for focussing the transmitted signals onto a desired tomographic plane and for focussing reflected signals from the plane onto the transducer 23 . The lens arrangement 22 contains rotating prism means 22b, 22c for causing the transmitted beam to scan the desired tomographic plane and the system incorporates compensat ing means 23b, 70, 75 for compensating for the deviation, in the focussed beam received at the transducer means, result ing from the rotation of the prism means 22b, 22c in the time between the passage therethough of the corresponding transmitted and received ultrasonic waves.
