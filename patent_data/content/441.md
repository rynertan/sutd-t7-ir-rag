# Improvements in or relating to devices for extracting energy from wave power.

## Abstract
The invention provides a device for extracting energy from waves on a liquid, the device having a chamber 14 with an opening for the flow of liquid into and out of the chamber to provide a quantity of the liquid which is arranged to oscillate in the chamber to provide energy from these oscillations. In order to maximise the energy absorption efficiency of the device, that portion of the device to be submerged and lie in a vertical plane aligned in the direction of propagation of the waves is of asymmetric shape, and the device is arranged to be held in a manner to inhibit movement of the device itself in response to the waves.
