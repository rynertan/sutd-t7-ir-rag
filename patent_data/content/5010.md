# Use of modified petroleum resins in printing ink compositions.

## Abstract
A carboxyl modified, metal free petroleum resin comprising a resin obtained by thermal polymerization of a feed containing cyclopentadiene and or methylcyclopentadiene and or derivatives thereof having been reacted electrophilically with a carboxylic acid, said modified resin having an acid number less than 20, containing from 1 wt. to 5 wt. of oxygen and having a softening point of from 120 C to 200 C. These resins may be prepared by heating a resin obtained by thermal polymerization of a feed containing a cyclopentadiene and or methylcyclopentadiene and or derivatives thereof with a carboxylic acid to a temperature in the range 200 C to 270 C and subsequently removing free acid to reduce the acid number to below 20. These resins maybe used for offset printing inks, and suitable printing ink compositions comprise a 5 to 30 by weight of such a resin b 5 to 30 by weight of a drying oil, c 20 to 40 by weight of a pigment, d 0 to 10 by weight of an assistant, and e a solvent being the balance, the weight percentages of components a , b , c and d being based on the total weight of the composition.
