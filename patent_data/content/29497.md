# Asporogenous mutant of bacillus subtilis and process for the use thereof as host component of a HV1 system.

## Abstract
Asporogenous mutant bacillus subtilus RUB 331 ATCC 31 578 produced by incorporating DNA from B. subtilus 168 T wild type in the spore forming B. subtilus RUB 830. This mutant reverts to spore formers with a frequency not greater than 10 ‚Å∑ reversions per bacterium per generation and meets the requirements of the NIH Guidelines for Research Involv ing Recombinant DNA Molecules for a B. subtilis host com ponent of a Host Vector 1 system.
