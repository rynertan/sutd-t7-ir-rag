# Humidity controlled microwave oven and method of cooking.

## Abstract
A microwave oven sensing system having a humidity sensor and a temperature sensor at an exit ventilation port of a microwave oven heating cavity to sense the exiting humidity and the air temperature of the microwave oven heating cavity is disclosed. The sensors connect to a programmable controller and input the sensed humidity and temperature of the microwave oven heating cavity to a programmable controller. Characteristic humidity curves for microwave cooking of different types of foods are stored in the memory of the programmable controller and the programmable controller controls the microwave cooking in accordance with a selected algorithm for the sensed environmental conditions. A numeric keyboard control panel inputs to the programmable controller the microwave cooking parameters and selects the desired characteristic humidity curve. The programmable controller may control a microwave power source control circuit and an air exchange circuit according to the selected algorithm in the programmable controller.
