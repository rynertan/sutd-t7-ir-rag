# Fluoroalkylaryliodonium compounds.

## Abstract
A fluoroalkylaryliodonium compound is of the general for mula RfCH₂ OSO₂A I where Ar alkylphenyl or halophenyl, A C1 10 alkyl or alkoxy, aryl, halogen or a polymer chain, Rf C1 20 poly fluoroalkyl or ASO₂O IAr CH₂ CF₂ The compounds are produced by reacting a compound Rf¹CH₂I OCOCF₃ ₂ where Rf¹ C1 20 polyfluoroalkyl or CF₃COO ₂ ICH₂ CF₂ By reacting the compound I with aniline or an alkylaniline in methylene chloride, a fluoroalkylaniline or derivative thereof is obtained which can be used to make a fluorine containing azo disperse dye.
