## Description
Quick LimeTHE PRESENT INVENTION relates to quick lime, and more particularly relates to quick lime having a relatively long hydration time, a process for the production of quick lime of this type herein called retarded lime and the use thereof. A few different methods for prolonging the hydration time of quick lime have been proposed. According to one such method the quick lime is mixed, for example, with saccharides or borates without any heat treatment. A certain prolongation of the hydrotion time can be obtained with this method, but the prolongation is not very greot. This is especially the case when large amounts of quick lime are treated by the method and subsequently hydrated. To achieve a better prolongation of the hydration lime, more complicated methods have been used. In one known method the lime is burnt for a long time at an extremely high temperature, 1400 18000C. Then a very inactive, so called deod burnt , lime is obtained. In another known method the lime is also burnt at a temperature of 1400 18000C. However, in this method the burning takes place in the presence of a compound such as Si02 or gypsum. These compounds protect the lime or form a complex with it. Thus, for a certain time, the water is prevented from coming into contact with the lime particles. One drawback of the two last mentioned methods is the high burning temperatures needed for the lime. It is, of course, expensive to produce these high temperatures. Moreover, only very narrow intervals for particle size and crystal size can be used. According to one aspect of this invention there is provided quick lime which has been treated at an elevated temperature wherein the quick lime is treated at that elevated temperature in the presence of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of monocorboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid and polycarboxylic acid, a salt of any one of these acids or a salt of an oxophosphoric acid in such a way that a chemical reaction occurs between the lime and the acid or salt used, the quick lime having a relotively long hydration time. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the production of quick lime with a relatively long hydration time wherein the process comprises mixing quick lime with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of monocarboxylic acid, dicarboxylic acid and polycarboxylic acid, a salt of any one of these acids or a salt of an oxophosphoric acid and keeping the mixture obtained for I to 36 hours at on elevated temperature of 50 to 4500C. Preferably the mixture is stirred whilst it is retained at said elevated temperature. Conveniently the mixture is retained at said elevated temperature for I to 10 hours. Advantageously said elevated temperature is between 90 and 3000C. In order to achieve the desired effect the added compound or compounds should advantageously be about 0.4 15, preferably 0.4 10 percent by weight of the lime. The precise quantity of added compound or compounds used depends on the particular acid or salt used and the degree of retardation of the lime that is required. One especially preferable embodiment of the invention is obtained if the quick lime is mixed with oxalic acid. Then preferably 0.4 6 percent by weight oxalic acid is added to the lime. In preferred embodiments the added compound or compounds are present as a powder. However, in principle also compounds in liquid form con be used. The quick lime is used as the starting material for a process according to the present invention suitably consists of socalled normally burnt lime which has been burnt at a temperature of about 900 13500C. Of course, it is a great advantage that such an eosily available raw material can be used instead of highly burnt lime which has been used in previously known processes. After cooling, the quick lime with prolonged hydration time produced according to the invention can be mixed with 0.1 5 percent by weight of a water reducing agent. The water reducing agent may be sulphonated melamine formaldehyde resin, lignosulphonote, Na2S04 or naphthalene form aldehyde resin. In this way the hydration time can be further increased. Of course, other water reducing agents can be used. The term water reducing agent is used in this specification to mean an agent which can be added to mortar or a mortar like mixture increase the flowability of the mortar. Thus, by using such an agent it is possible to make a mortar with good flow properties, but only a small quantity of water. Such agents are readily available for use, for example when laying cement floors. It is believed that such materials are anion active and thus provide a dispersing effect. The quick lime with prolonged hydration time produced by a preferred process according to the invention may be primarily intended to be used as an active component in a static demolition agent. Such an agent consists of a composition which swells and generates an expansive pressure after being mixed with water. The expansive pressure is then generoted wholly or partly by the hydration of the quick lime calcium oxide to calcium hydroxide. Static demolition agents are preferably used for cracking and dividing brittle materials such as stone, concrete and the like. Usually holes are drilled into the stone or the like, and the demolition agent is introduced to the hole. The demolition agent then swells and cracks the stone. A suitable static demolition agent con for instance contain 4g95 per cent by weight of a quick lime with prolonged hydration time produced by a process according to the invention and 5 40 percent by weight of Si02. Usually the particle size of the lime isO 1.0 mm, preferably 0 0.5 mm. Instead of Si02 one or more other pozzolanic materials can be used. Furthermore, the static demolition agent can contain a hydroulic binder such as cement. Portland cement is an example of a suitable cement. The purposes of the pozzolanic moterial ond or the hydraulic binder in the demolition agent is to prevent the demolition agent from spurting up from the holes that are drilled in a stone or the like to receive the demolition agent. When the demolition agent is used it is usually mixed with 25 40 per cent by weight of water to form a manageable mass which is then poured into these holes. The stone is then, after a time, crocked by the expansive force. The time can vary between sone hours up to a couple of days depending, for instance, on the hydration time of the retarded lime, the material to be cracked, the temperature of the surroundings and the diameter of the holes. The invention will be further explained in connection with the examples given below of which Examples 1 IS illustrate the production of quick lime with a prolonged hydration time according to the invention.Examples 16 18, 37 39 and 4648 relate to comparison tests outside the scope of the present invention.
