# Process for the preparation of aromatic b fused pyridines and novel thieno b pyridines.

## Abstract
Aromatic Î± halo b fused pyridines are made by reacting an aromatic acetamide, acid halide and amide in particular proportions, with the acid halide always in excess. The process permits the production of compounds having a wide range of substituents, that are new compounds, and that are of value as intermediates in the synthesis of, for instance, pharmaceutical compounds.
