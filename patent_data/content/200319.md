# Foamable polyorganosiloxane compositions.

## Abstract
Polyorganosiloxane foams are prepared by the volatili zation of a blowing agent within a polyorganosiloxane composition that is curable by a hydrosilation reaction and includes as a foam stabilizer a resinous polyorganosiloxane comprising trimethylsiloxy units, SiO
