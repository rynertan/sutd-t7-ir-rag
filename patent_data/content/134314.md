## Description
REMOVAL OF SULFATE IONS FROM BRINE Various alkali metal halide aqueous solutions or alkaline earth metal halide aqueous solutions, e.g.,NaCl brine or MgC12 brine, contain sulfate values or sulfate ions which are considered detrimental if the aqueous solution is intended for use in certain applications, such as in electrolytic processes. There are commercial incentives to substantially remove such sulfate ions. It is known that hydrous zirdonium oxide and other zirconium compounds, such as zirconium phosphates, are useful as inorganic ion exchangers. According to the invention, an amorphous polymeric hydrous zirconium oxide is formed within the resin beads of a macroporous cation exchange resin of the sulfonic acid type, thereby forming novel ion.exchange composite structures which are useful in removing sulfate ions from metal halide brines. The invention also contemplates within its scope, the formation of the amorphous polymeric hydrous zirconium oxide within the resin beads of the macroporous cation exchange resin of the sulfonic acid type and acrylic acid polymerized within the bead matrix, thereby forming novel ion exchange composite structures which are useful in removing sulfate as well as borate, bicarbonate, and or phosphate ions from alkali metal halide brines. It is known that zirconium hydroxide is prepared by alkali precipitation of an aqueous solution of a zirconyl salt. For the present invention it is preferred that the alkali be ammonia since it is more easily washed out than the alkali metal hydroxides or alkaline earth metal hydroxides. Precipitation at cold ambient temperature gives a gelatinous product which is substantially Zr OR 4 containing about 26.5 water or more. A partially dehydrated zirconyl hydroxide,ZrO OH 2, results from drying it at elevated temperature e.g., 1000C , or from hot precipitation e.g., 850C followed by hot drying. Thus, in the present invention the expression hydrous zirconium oxide has within the purview of its meaning any of the various amorphous hydrated forms of zirconium oxide which are substantially or largely insoluble in water. The macroporous cation exchange resin is one which contains sulfonic acid SO3 functional groups.Such resins are available commercially, such as sulfonated polymers of styrene cross linked with divinylbenzene. For instance a macroporous cation exchange resin with S03Na or SO3H groups affixed to a styrene divinylbenzene resin structure is sold by The DowChemical Company under the tradename DOWEXe MSC 1 Na and DOWEXe MSC l H . It is within the purview of the present invention to use any porous resin containing sulfonic acid functional groups, so long as the resin is substantially inert or non reactive, when used in the present invention, except for the reactivity of the sulfonic acid functionality groups. In general, the polymeric zirconium hydrous oxide is formed within the resin beads by wetting the resin with an aqueous solution of a soluble zirconyl compound, such as ZrOCl2SE2O. If excessive zirconyl solution is present, it should be drained off and the resin substantially dried, such as by air drying. The dried resin, containing the zirconyl compound is neutralized, preferably by use of NH4OB, thereby forming polymeric ZrO OH 2. Excess N4OR and NE4C1 which forms is washed out, such as by repeated contact with water or NaCl brine. Optionally, the composite is impregnated with acrylic acid which is polymerized in situ with a free radical or redox polymerization initiator or catalyst.The composite is then preferably treated with an acid. Optionally, excessive zirconyl solution should be drained off and the resin thoroughly washed with water to substantially remove the zirconyl compound from the void spaces pores of the resin, leaving only that which is taken up into the resin phase, then is optionally dried, such as by air drying. In the general process outlined above, the beginning zirconyl compound may be ZrOCl2xE2O or the like, such as Zr N03 4 5E2O, ZrOBr2 xE2O, ZrOI28B2O, Qr Zr SO4 24E2O, or any such zirconium compound which will precipitate to form ZrO OH 2 when contacted with a base, especially NE40H. The so formed ZrO OH 2, also called zirconium hydrous oxide , is an amorphous, polymeric structure. Following the above alkalizing step, the acid used for lowering the pH is preferably HCl, but may also be HBr, HI, HN03, and the like. Following the above alkalizing step, acrylic acid monomer is optionally polymerized in situ in the composite and the acid is then used for lowering the pE. As stated above, once the resin has been acidized, the composite is ready to take on SO4 values from brine. This is done, for example, by placing the composite in a vessel, preferably a column, and passing sulfate containing brine through the composite until the composite is substantially loaded with SOD values and is ready for another aqueous washing. The aqueous washing of the resin to remove sulfate values therefrom, and to regenerate the resin, may be done with water in some cases, e.g., with NaC1 brine, but is preferably done with alkaline water, e.g., with MgC12 brine. For example, the alkaline wash water may be Mg hydrate, caustic, NH4OE and the like.Following the alkaline wash, the pH of the resin is lowered using an acid wash. It is within the purview of this invention that the metal salt brine may be a natural brine, such as seawater or mineral brine, a MgCl2 brine, a LiCl brine, a RCl brine, or a metal salt brine which comes from an ore dressing, ore leaching, mineral dressing, and the like. The brine may contain only a small amount, say less than about one percent of hardness values, preferably less than about 0.1 percent hardness values. The present novel composite exhibits a high affinity for, and a strong preference for, SO ions, but is also effective for borate, bicarbonate, and or phosphate ions. The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention, but the invention is not limited to the particular examples shown.Example 1 Here, there is used a macroporous cation exchange resin with SO3 Na groups affixed SO 3Na groups affixed to a styrene divinylbenzene resin structure. Seventy gms of this resin is wetted with a solution of 30 gms ZrOC12 8H20 in 30 gms H2O. The wet resin is air dried to a weight of 95.5 gms. The air dried resin is neutralized with a solution of 16 ml of 30 aqueous NH3 and 35 ml H2O. The excess NH4OH and the NH4Cl are washed out by repeated contact with 26 NaCl solution. The washed resin, suspended in an equal volume of 26 NaCl solution has a pH value glass electrode of about 8.2. Addition of two ml of 36 HC1 lowers the pH to 2.8. The final resin has a settled volume of 139. ml. X ray diffraction analysis shows no detectable crystallinity. A vol. of 116 ml of the above resin composite is placed in a column with 73 cm bed depth. Twenty six percent NaCl brine containing 970 ppm SO4 is pumped downflow at 3.3 ml min and 500C. The effluent brine contains less than 10 ppm SO for more than 1.5 bed volumes of brine. The resin is washed downflow with water at a rate of 21 ml min. and at 500 550C. The effluent is cut into 25 ml portions.The SO concentration is found to peak in the fourth cut at 14.8 gms. liter. After one liter of water passage the total S04 in the effluent is 2.91 gms, which is 70 of the So content of the resin in the column.Twenty six percent NaCl brine is acidified to 1.0 pH, and is then pumped downflow through the column at 21 ml. min. The influent brine contains 970 ppm SO4 and the effluent 110 120 ppm SO4. The resin is converted from the Na form to the Ng form by treatment with an excess of 0.5NMgC12. The resin is put in the column and treated with a solution of 6 gms of MgAc2 4E20 magnesium acetate in 150 ml H2O at a flow rate of 10 ml min at 500C. This is followed by 550 ml N 10 HC1 at the same rate.The total S04 removed from the resin is 0.532 gms.Thirty six percent MgC12 containing 1.13 gm S04 liter, adjusted to one pH, is pumped through at 1.7 ml min and 500C. Over one bed volume of effluent is produced with an average So eontent of 40 ppm. Polymerization of acrylic acid in aqueous solution is readily and conveniently carried out by application of heat, especially in the presence of a free radical generator, e.g., a small amount of h K2S208 Redox initiators may also be used. The addition of and in situ polymerization of acrylic acid may, alternatively, be performed prior to addition of and precipitation of the zirconium compound. Other polymerizable carboxylic acid monomers may be used, e.g., methacrylic acid, but acrylic acid is preferred because it is the smallest in molecular size of the unsaturated carboxylic acids. In certain embodiments the product may be described as a macroporous ion exchange resin of the sulfonated styrene divinyl benzene type e.g., DOWEXe MSC 1 containing throughout its bead structure gelatinous zirconium hydroxide or zirconyl hydroxide, and further modified by polyacrylic acid formed by absorbing monomeric acrylic acid into the structure and polymerizing in situ. The resin is initially activated for SO4 pick up by acidizing to 2 3 pH with HC1, thus converting the polymeric Zr OH 4 to a polymer of the composition Zr OH 3C1. The SO pick up is an exchange of 2C1 for one SO4.Water regeneration removes NagSO4 the SO4 comes from the Zr OH 3 2SO and the Na from the SO3Na and the COOINa The initial resin generally contains on the order of at least about one meg. SO3E groups per ml,Zr OH 4 is added to about 0.8 atom Zr per atom S, and acrylic acid is added to approximately one molecule per atom Zr. Preferred operation is counterflow at rates of 0.01 0.1 VB min. at 400 600C with about two to about three pH. The flow rate may be increased to 0.2 0.25 VB min. at 1000 1200C where hot salt brine and water are available. At pH values of much less than two theCOONa will be present as COOB and thus will reduce the efficiency of E2 regeneration at pH values much above about three some of the Zr will exist as Zr OH 4 and pick up much less so4. Example 2 Performance in the removal of SO4 from 26 4 NaCl with water regeneration is compared between resins with and without COOH groups. Detailed preparation and operating data are given below. About 150 ml of DOWER MSC 1 8 DVB,50 100 mesh ground in H form was washed and put in a glass column. Thirty two percent aqueous ZrOC12 was run through the column downflow until the effluent density was the same as the influent. N2 gas was run through the resin until it was dry and free flowing. Dry weight was 119.7 gms. This resin was poured into 120 ml of 30 aqueous NH3 and allowed to react for 15 minutes. The resin was washed well with water and then with 26 NaC1. Immersed in excess 26 NaCl it was titrated with N 1HC1 to 2.4 pH requiring 85 meg. HCl. The resin volume was now 130 ml. One hundred sixteen ml of resin was put in a column and operated upflow with 25 NaCl containing 1800 mg l SO4 at 2.4 pE at 10 ml min and 720C. Seven hundred fifteen ml of brine effluent was obtained with the last 100 ml analyzing 1230 mg l sO4. The resin was regenerated with water downflow at 3.3 ml min and 720C, taking cuts of the effluent for analysis.

It was added to a stirred pot with 75 ml E2O and a solution containing 20 ml H2O, 5 gm acrylic acid, and 0.2 gm K252O8. The mix was stirred for 60 minutes at 250C to initiate polymerization. The mix was then put in a beaker, covered with aluminum foil and put in a 950c oven overnight to complete polymerization. It boiled to dryness with a small amount of overflow and loss of resin. It was washed with water to give a resin volume of 124 ml hence a loss of 6 ml . Immersed in 26 Nacl and titrated up to 2.4 pH with 3 ml N 1 NaOH.One hundred sixteen ml of resin was put in a column and saturated upflow with 900 ml of 2.4 pH 26 NaCl containing 1800 mg i So , at a flow rate of 10 ml min and a temperature of 720C. The resin was then regenerated downflow with water at 3.2 ml min and 72 C, taking cuts of the effluent for SO4 analysis Cut Vol. mull soT ms l 1 50 1,690 2 25 1,517 3 10 2,976 4 10 8,736 5 10 11,616 6 10 9,456 7 10 7,776 8 10 5,904 9 10 4,772 10 10 4,147 11 10 not analyzed 12 10 3,312 13 10 not analyzed 14 10 not analyzed 15 25 not analyzed 16 50 1,440 The present invention relies, in part, on the step of substantially washing the zirconyl compound, such as ZrOCl2, from the void spaces pores of the resin, leaving only the zirconyl compound within the resin phase. Adequate washing with water is determined by analyzing the wash water to determine that substantially no further ZrO or Cl or other salt ions is being removed.The washing is done with salt free water so as not to remove the zirconyl compound from the resin phase. In one representative embodiment there is used a macroporous crosslinked styrene divinylbenzene copolymer which has been sulfonated to about one 503E group per benzene ring. The beads have about 30 40 porosity and a surface area of about 40 50 M2 gm. The preferred product contains one Zr atom for each two S03H groups, having been formed by exchanging all of the H ions in the resin for ZrO ions from excessZrOCl2 solution. At this intermediate stage the product is specifically a styrene divinylbenzene polymer network with affixed S03 2 ZrO ionic groups.The close proximity of the Zero ions and the R S03 ions is maintained during the reaction with NE40E to Zr OH 4 2R S02 0NH4 and with NaCl and BC1 to the final product ZrO OH Cl 2R SO2 O Na . This close proximity enhances removal ofNa2S04 by water, after the Cl has been exchanged to 504. The range of ratios of Zr S of 0.4 to 0.6 is an operable range preferably, though, the ratio is around or about 0.5. When using a crosslinked copolymer of styrene divinylbenzene as the sulfonated polymer for use as a cation exchange resin, it is preferred that the divinylbenzene content of the copolymer be in the range of about 6 20 , preferably around or about 10 . In contacting the influent brine with the exchange resin composite in accordance with the present invention, it is preferred to operate at about 400C to about 600C using a brine pH between about 1 2, using a contact flow rate of about 0.05 to about 0.1 bed volume per minute BVPM , and using a counterflow water wash to regenerate the resin once it is loaded with the sulfate or borate or other ions being removed from the brine. At a pH below about one and using a concentrated metal chloride brine, some solubility of ZrOC12 is likely to be encountered, especially at high temperature.By operating at a pE above about 1.5 but still at an acid pH higher temperatures of up to 1000C, or even close to boiling point of the brine, are permissible at 400C 600C, flow rates greater than 0.1 BVPM may cause leakage and an early breakthrough of the sulfate, borate, or other ions sought to be removed from the brine. At pH of two and temperature of 1000C, efficient operation may be obtained at 0.2 BVPM. As stated above, counterflow of the water wash to regenerate the resin composite is preferred, but co flow is operable, though at lower efficiency.Example 3 About 150 ml of DOWEXe MSC 1 in H form, having a mesh size of about 20 50 U.S. standard sieve size was washed with water and loaded into a glass column. A 15 ZrOC12 aqueous solution was flowed down through the resin until the effluent gravity reached 1.10 gms cc. Then about 25 ml of 32 ZrOC12 aqueous solution was fed in, followed by one liter of water.Rinse water was flowed until neither ZrO or Cl could be detected in the effluent. This thorough washing removed excess ZrOC12 from the voids pores of the resin, but did not remove the ionically held groups from the 503 groups in the resin phase. The resin was removed from the column and treated with excess NH40H about 25 ml of 30 NH3 . The resin was washed free of excess NH40H and NH4C1 which forms , immersed in 26 Nail, and titrated with 1N HC1 to 1.S pH requiring 87 meq. HC1 . The settled volume of the final resin was 144 ml. One hundred sixteen ml of the resin was loaded into a temperature controlled jacketed glass column and contacted with 1.S pH 26 NaCl containing 2000 mg l S04 upflow at 10 ml min and 650C. No SO was detectable in the effluent until 850 ml when a breakthrough of 100 ppm S04 was observed. A total 26 NaCl flow of 1000 ml was achieved with a composite analysis of 173 mg L So . The S04 was eluted downflow with deionized water at 3.2 ml min. at 650C. The effluent was collected in cuts and analyzed for SO content, with the following results Effluent Cuts from Downflow Water Regeneration Cut Vol. ml SO4 g L 1 50 1.2864 2 25 1.2096 3 10 1.3824 4 10 2.0256 5 10 10.944 6 10 12.000 7 10 10.848 8 10 8.928 9 10 7.8048 10 10 6.768 11 10 6.000 12 10 not analyzed 13 10 4.3680 14 10 3.8093 15 25 3.0912 16 50 2.2464 After this downflow water regeneration, 26 NaCl upflow at 10 mi min. and 650C was resumed. No SO was detected in the effluent until 500 ml had been purified, at which time about 100 ppm of SO broke through. The composite analysis of the first 500 ml of 26 NaCl was 76.8 mg l SO .
