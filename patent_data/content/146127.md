# Controlled initiation chromium dioxide synthesis.

## Abstract
Modified chromium dioxide crystals with narrower par ticle size and more uniform coercivity are produced by add ing the modifying agent in an aqueous CrO₃ solution. Anti mony, tellurium and iron oxides may be dissolved in a sat urated CrO₃ water solution and added to the reaction mix ture paste to yield improved crystals upon synthesis.
