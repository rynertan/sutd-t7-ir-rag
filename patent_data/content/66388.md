# Method and means for bleeding hydraulic brakes.

## Abstract
A method and means for purging air from the hydraulic brake system of vehicles wherein the master brake cylinder 42 is connected hydraulically to a sump return conduit 40 of a hydraulic component 20 or 92 of the main hydraulic system which combines with a restriction 64 associated with the master cylinder 42 to cause a flow of pressure fluid from the return conduit 40 through the brake system when air bleed valves 82 in the brake system are open.
