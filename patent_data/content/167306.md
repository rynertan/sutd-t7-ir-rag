# Silicon nitride containing ceramics.

## Abstract
What is disclosed is a process for preparing a silicon nitride containing ceramic material from a R‚ÇÉSiNH containing silazane polymer, which has been rendered infusible by treatment with certain reactive metal halides, by heating the infusible silazane polymer to an elevated temper ature under an inert atmosphere. Suitable reactive metal halides are of the general formula MX
