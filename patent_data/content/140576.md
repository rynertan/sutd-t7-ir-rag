## Description
Flywheel for Internal Combustion Engine This invention relates to a flywheel for an internal combustion engine, adapted to be secured to an output shaft of the engine usually the crank shaft thereof and affording a surface for engagement with a friction element of a friction clutch the clutch being secured to the flywheel in use , and also affording peripheral gear teeth for engagement by the pinion of a starter motor. The most common form of flywheel presently used for internal combustion engines is an iron casting which has been finished by machining operations. The peripheral gear teeth are provided on a separate ring gear secured to the flywheel, usually by being shrunk onto it. Cast iron, if of the correct grade, has excellent frictional properties and resists wear of the clutch which inevitably occurs in service. However, if the friction surface of the flywheel is damaged, for example if the friction element driven plate of the clutch wears to an extent that rivets securing friction linings thereto contact the flywheel, it is then necessary to replace the whole flywheel which is expensive.It is possible to fit a new ring gear if the latter becomes damaged, but this also is a difficult and expensive operation. A further problem encountered with such conventional flywheels is that of achieving adequate strength in terms of resistance to breakage under centrifugal force at high engine speeds. This problem can be overcome by use of a cast iron material of a higher specification, but this is expensive. Flywheel constructions of considerable complexity have been proposed, incorporating numbers of parts assembled together. However, no proposal has been aimed at overcoming the problems above set forth. It is the object of the present invention to provide a flywheel in which these disadvantages are overcome or reduced. According to the invention, we provide a flywheel for an internal combustion engine, comprising a first element of sheet metal, having peripheral gear teeth and a portion adapted to be secured to an output shaft of the engine, and a second element affording a surface for engagement by a friction element of a friction clutch secured to the flywheel in use, said first and second elements having faceto face engagement over an area constituting at least the major portion of the axially presented surface area of said second element. Preferably said area of engagement is at least 80 of said axially presented area, and is planar. Preferably said first element is a sheet steel pressing, and said gear teeth, integral therewith, are hardened, e.g. by induction hardening. Said second element is preferably of cast iron, since this affords desirable frictional properties as referred to above. The second element may be secured to the first element in use by means, e.g bolts, which also holds the clutch to the flywheel. Then, if the clutch is removed from the flywheel the two elements of the flywheel can relatively easily be separated. Dowel pins or the like may be provided to hold the second and first elements of the flywheel together for shipping and handling purposes and to ensure correct alignment of the elements with themselves and with a clutch secured thereto. The advantage of a flywheel according to the invention is that one element thereof can be replaced without replacement of the other element. If the friction surface is worn, the second element only of the flywheel need be replaced, which is much more economical than replacement of the whole flywheel as required hitherto. If the starter gear teeth are damaged, replacement of the first element of the flywheel is much more convenient than having to fit a new ring gear as has been required hitherto, and less expensive than replacement of the entire flywheel. The large area of face to face contact between said elements, which area preferably is planar, ensures good thermal conduction between the elements, dimensional stability, and strength. The cast iron element is supported by the sheet metal element, and so is resistant to failure under centrifugal face. With regard to the thermal properties of the flywheel, it has been found that good thermal conductivity between the elements is of importance in avoiding hot spots at the friction surface and ensuring the heat sink effect of the flywheel is adequate to meet service conditions. The elements of the flywheel may be balanced individually, or as a sub assembly, depending on requirements for servicing. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which FIGURE 1 is a section through a flywheel according to the invention. FIGURE 2 is a section through a further embodiment of flywheel according to the invention. The flywheel illustrated in Figure 1 of the drawings comprises two elements, the first of which is a sheet steel pressing 10. The element 10 has a central region 11 provided with circumferentially spaced apertures 12 for receiving bolts to secure it to the crank shaft or other output shaft of an internal combustion engine. At its external periphery, the element 10 is provided, eg by a conventional gear cutting process, with gear teeth 13 for engagement by a starter motor pinion. The gear teeth 13 are hardened, e.g.by induction hardening, and a suitable grade of sheet steel must be employed for the element 10 to enable this to be done. The second element of the flywheel comprises an annular component 15 of cast iron, affording a friction surface 16 for engaging one side of the driven plate of a clutch to be secured to the flywheel. The clutch would be secured to the flywheel by a plurality of axially extending bolts provided at circumferentially spaced positions around the periphery of the cover of the assembly, which bolts pass through apertures 17 in the second element 15 of the flywheel and enter screw threaded apertures 14 in the first element 10 of the flywheel. The cover member of a clutch, in which would be mounted the pressure plate and a spring means of the clutch and within which the driven plate would be disposed, is indicated at 18. Thus when installed the first and second elements of the flywheel are rigidly secured to one another.There may be provided means such as dowels to hold the two elements of the flywheel in assembled relation with one another until the flywheel is installed. It will be noted that the elements of the flywheel lie in contacting face to face relationship, in a radial plane, over substantially the entire axially presented surface area of the second element 15. This ensures dimensional stability, strength, and good thermal conductivity between the flywheel elements. If there were not such contact over the major portion of the area of element 15, eg.approximately 80 of such area, there may arise local thermal problems since the element 15 alone may not provide an adequate heat sink. Referring now to Figure 2 of the drawings, the embodiment of flywheel there illustrated comprises a first element 20 which is a pressing of sheet steel. This element has a central region 21 provided with circumferentially spaced apertures 22 for receiving bolts to secure it to an engine crankshaft. An apertured ring 23 reinforces the part 21 of the element 20. The second element of the flywheel comprises an anular cast iron component 25, affording a surface 26 for engagement with a clutch driven plate. The element 25 has circumferentially spaced apertures 27 for receiving bolts by which a clutch cover assembly, not shown, is secured to the flywheel, such bolts extending in to captive nuts 24 fixed to the element 20. The periphery of the element 20 has an axially extending portion 29 provided with gear teeth 30 for engagement by a starter motor pinion. Such gear teeth may be formed by a rolling process, in which the material is deformed in successive passes of an appropriately shaped tool to raise the teeth 30 thereof without metal removal.Such a forming process is well known and enables relatively thin material to be used for the element 20. The teeth 30 are hardened as in the embodiment of Figure 1. It will be noted that the flywheel of Figure 2, as for that shown in Figure 1, has a large planor area of contact between its first and second elements 20,25
