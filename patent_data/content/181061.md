## Description
LABELLING ORGANIC MOLECULES WITH SULPHUR 35 This invention relates to methods and reagents for labelling organic molecules, particularly macromolecules, with sulphur 35 S 35 to the labelled molecules and to their use in autoradiography. S 35 has a half life of 87.2 days and decays with the production of beta particles of energy 0.167 MeV.Carrier free S 35 having a specific activity of about 1500 Ci mmol is available commercially. A limited range of organic compounds including sulphur containing amino acids and taurine can be produced in labelled form at high specific activity by causing a suitable micro organism to assimilate a nutrient containing S 35 and generate the desired compound. Polypeptides can be synthesised by a laborious technique involving the use of individual S 35 labelled amino acids. Other compounds can be labelled by isotope exchange techniques or other synthetic methods, but generally only at low specific activity. There is no general S35 labelling reagent which can be directed at specific desired reactive groups of the compound to be labelled. By contrast I 125 labelling reagents are well documented and widely used, particularly for labelling proteins and polypeptides. The best known reagent for coupling to amino groups is the Bolton Hunter reagent I 125 labelled N succinimidyl 3 1i hydroxyphenyl propionate,as described in the review of J.J. Langone in Methods in Enzymology, 73, 6, 112 127. Another reagent is tert butoxycarbonyl L I 125 iodotyrosine N hydroxy succinimide ester which has the advantage over the Bolton Hunter reagent that a derivatized peptide is readily deblocked to form a radio labelled product with the same net charge as the starting material. I 125 labelled proteins and polypeptides are widely used for analysis by autoradiography. In this application, S 35 labelled proteins and polypeptides can give shorter exposure times and superior resolution ability to distinguish neighbouring bands or spots of analyte to their I 125 labelled counterparts. Tritium labelling reagents, e.g. H 3 N succinimidyl propionate F3H NSP are also well documented. Molecules are labelled with 3H NSP to specific activities of 100 Ci nnnol per amino group substituted hence lower sensitivity is achieved than with S 35 labelled molecules. There is a need for general methods and reagents for labelling proteins and polypeptides withS 35.This invention fulfills that need, and in addition provides a method having improved safety compared with existing methods using I 125 labelling reagents. In one aspect this invention provides a method of labelling an organic molecule having a reactive group, which method comprises providing a labelling reagent which is a derivative of a sulphur containing amino acid or taurine labelled with an artificially high concentration of S 35 which derivative includes a coupling group reactive with the reactive group of the organic molecule, and bringing together the organic molecule and the labelling reagent under conditions to couple the labelling reagent to the organic molecule by reaction between the reactive group and the coupling group. In another aspect, the invention provides a labelling reagent which is a derivative of a sulphurcontaining amino acid or taurine labelled with an artificially high concentration of S 35 which derivative includes a coupling group reactive with a reactive group of an organic molecule to be labelled. The method of the invention involves coupling the labelling reagent to the organic molecule.Although the nature of the organic molecule is not critical, the invention is of particular importance in relation to macromolecules. For example, proteins and polypeptides are widely used in protein blotting applications and can advantageously be labelled by this method. The organic molecule carries a reactive group, but the nature of this is not critical since the only requirement is that it react with the coupling group of the labelling reagent. For proteins and polypeptides, the reactive groups will generally be primary amino or thiol groups. Other possible reactive groups include phenolic hydroxyl, aliphatic hydroxyl, imidazole and guanidyl. The labelling reagent is a derivative of a sulphur containing amino acid, for example, cysteine, cysteic acid,cystine, and, particularly, methionine or of taurine. There may be used d or l isomers of these amino acids where two or more separate isomers exist, or mixtures of isomers. The reagent is labelled with an artificially high concentration of S 35, generally at a specific activity of at least 1 Ci mmol, and this is perfectly adequate for some uses. For other uses including autoradiography,high specific activities of more than 100 Ci mmol, and preferably at least 1000 Ci mmol are required. These labelling reagents may be prepared from their respective labelled amino acids, all of which are commercially available at high specific activity. It is an advantage of S 35 labelling reagents based on amino acids that they can be prepared at high specific activity, whereas this is not true of S 35 labelled compounds generally. The labelling reagent includes a coupling group reactive with the reactive group of the organic molecule to be labelled. Usually, though not always, a carboxylic acid group is modified to provide the coupling group. A preferred coupling group is the Nsuccinimidyl group that results from the condensation of a carboxylic acid with N hydroxysuccinimide in the presence of a carbodiimide EMI4.1 and which readily couples with a primary amine under mild conditions.EMI4.2 Another similar coupling group, having the advantage of enhanced water solubility is the N sulphosuccinimidyl group derived from N hydroxysulphosuccinimide EMI4.3 Coupling groups based on maleimide are suitable for reaction with thiol groups. Coupling groups based on hydrazide are suitable for reaction with carbohydratesMany other coupling groups are reported in the literature and can be used. The Radiochemical Centre Technical Bulletin 79 6, Protein labelling reagents and references to their applications , gives a nonexhaustive list, with literature references, of labelling reagents with coupling groups suitable for reaction with different reactive groups of proteins and polypeptides. Amino groups in labelling reagents of this invention generally need to be protected in order to prevent self condensation. Amine protecting groups are well described in the literature. A book which describes a wide range is Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W. Greene, 1981 J. Wiley Son see page 218. Amine protective groups of particular interest are as follows Cleaved under acidic conditions 1. t butyl carbamate 2. 1 methyl 1 1 adamantyl ethyl carbamate 3. 2 trimethylsilylethyl carbamateCleaved under basic conditions 1. 9 fluorenylmethyl carbamate 2. 9 2 sulpho fluorenylmethyl carbamate 3. 2 phosphonoethyl carbamate 14. 1 , 1 dimethyl 2 cyanoethyl carbamate 5. pyridinium acetamide Cleaved under neutral conditions 1. 8 quinolyl carbamateCleaved by photolysis 1. m nitrophenyl carbamate Alternatively, the protecting group can be chosen to be a photoactivatable group such as an aromatic azido group, giving rise to a high specific activity radioactive photolabile bifunctional reagent.A review of photoaffinity reagents is contained in the book Photogenerated reagents in biochemistry and molecular biology , H. Bayley, 1983 Elsevier .Photoactivatable groups react, upon activation, indiscriminately with anything in the vicinity, so that it is not possible to target them for reaction with specific reactive groups. For this reason, we do not contemplate the use of such photoactivatable groups as coupling groups in the labelling reagents of this invention. Alternatively, an amino group of the amino acid can be modified to form a coupling group which may for example be N succinimidyl or iodoacetyl. In such cases a carboxylic acid group may be protected by esterification. Preferred labelling agents according to the invention have formulae a Methionine EMI6.1 b Cysteine EMI6.2 c Cysteic acid EMI6.3 d Cystine EMI6.4 e Taurine H03 SCH2CHNHY f the decarboxylated derivatives of a b c d i.e.EMI6.5 etc. g the deaminated derivatives of a b c d I.e.EMI7.1 etc.where S means S including an artificially high concentration of 5 35 R is either absent or if present means 0 or 2 or an alkyl group X is a protecting group such as tertiarybutoxycarbonyl, or which may be photolabile, Y is a coupling group such as N succinimidyl, and Z is an inert,eg alkyl ,group or a photolabile group. These labelled reagents may be prepared by standard chemical routes from the labelled amino acid or taurine. The following reaction diagrams 1 to 5 summarise the chemistry involved. In these diagrams the following abbreviations have been used. means S with an enhanced concentration of S 35.BOC means tert butoxycarbonylNHS means N hydroxysuccinimide, or when forming part of a labelled compound N succinimidylBOC ON means 2 tert butoxycarbonyl oxyimino 2phenylacetonitrileDCC means dicyclohexylcarbodiimide per TFA means trifluoroperacetic acidMCPBA means m chloroperbenzoic acid These summaries are not intended to be exhaustive.Thus in diagram 1. any reagent based on methionine could be oxidised either to the sulphone or to the sulphoxide. although these reactions are only shown for one reagent. Further in each of diagrams 1, 2, 3 and 4. any amino acid could be either decarboxylated or deaminated, although this has not been shown.Decarboxylation or deamination would normally be performed on the labelled amino acid before derivatization. A labelling reagent based on such a decarboxylated or deaminated amino acid would contain a coupling group but normally no protecting group.

Classes of macromolecules which can be labelled in this way include nucleic acids, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides. But the invention is likely to be of particular importance in the labelling of proteins and polypeptides, which terms are defined broadly to include glycoproteins, lipoproteins, nucleoproteins, mucoproteins, haemoproteins and lectins.Other organic molecules which can be labelled with advantage include biotin analogues such as biocytin and analogues of the calcium channel blockers iodopine and azidopine and related compounds. The method of this invention involves reacting an organic molecule having a reactive group, particularly a macromolecule such as a protein or peptide having a series of reactive groups, with the labelling reagent.The chemistry of this reaction is standard and depends on the nature of the coupling group of the labelling reagent. For labelling proteins and peptides, this reaction in similar to that undergone by the Bolton Hunter reagent.But the Bolton Hunter reagent is perceived to have a disadvantage in that it may decompose to form very small amounts of free volatile 125I2. With the diiodo compound, this disadvantage is certainly very real.For this reason, it is customary to use charcoal traps during evaporation of the benzene prior to use. The S 35 labelling reagents of this invention do not suffer from this disadvantage. By way of example, the reaction of lysine epsilonNH2 groups of protein with a labelling reagent based on methionine can be shown asEMI14.1 At this point, the protecting group X can if desired be left in position. Or it can be removed to regenerate a primary amino group, thereby retaining the original charge on the molecule. Where X is a photoactivatable group, it can be activated so as to cross link the labelling reagent protein conjugate to another protein molecule for example a receptor. In another aspect, this invention includes macromolecules such as proteins and polypeptides labelled with S 35 at a specific activity of at least 50 Ci mmol, preferably at least 100 Ci mmol. The method of this invention permits for the first time labelling of macromolecules with S 35 at such high specific activities. Products which we have labelled by the method of this invention include Protein A, anti mouse Ig whole antibody, anti rabbit Ig whole antibody and streptavidin. Other products which can be labelled similarly include F ab 2 fragments, protein molecular weight markers and lectins. These products are characterized by having side chains which have been modified by reagents derived from sulphur containing amino acids including an artificially high proportion of S 35. Many of these products are new materials in their own right and are included as such in the scope of this invention. The labelled products generally have specific activities of at least 1 Ci mmol, preferably at least 50 Ci mmol, depending on the number of reactive groups in the molecule and the molar ratio of reagent to substrate. The S 35 labelled products are particularly valuable for applications involving autoradiography.In this technique a photographic film is placed directly over the radiolabelled material. Silver halide crystals in the emulsion respond to the betaparticles emitted by S 35. Film blackening increases with the number of beta particles emitted until saturation is reached. The reagents described are particularly useful in blotting experiments in which proteins are transferred from a polyacrylamide gel to the surface of a membrane e.g. nitrocellulose and then detected immunochemically. The technique is reviewed by J.M. Gershoni et al in Analytical Biochemistry 131 1 15 1983 . The most widely used radioactive detection agents for protein blotting are I 125 labelled proteins and polypeptides. However, S 35 labelled proteins and polypeptides have several advantages, as follows a S 35 has a longer half life 87.2 d than does I 125 60 d . b Labelling of proteins and polypeptides with I 125 using the Bolton Hunter reagent involves, as noted above, some slight hazard from volatile 1251 2 c The gamma rays produced by 1 125 tend to pass straight through photographic film so that only a small proportion of their energy is captured and recorded by the film, most being wasted. This problem can to some extent be overcome by the use of an intensifying screen, with the film sandwiched between the screen and the sample,but the resulting improvement in sensitivity is obtained at the expense of resolution.Overall, our work indicates that improved sensitivity and improved resolution can be obtained at the same time in autoradiography work by using S 35 labelled compounds in place of I 125 labelled ones. In view of these advantages, it is perhaps surprising that S 35 labelled proteins and polypeptides have not supplanted I 125 labelled ones when autoradiography is used as the detection method. The reason is believed to be the lack of a general S 35 labelling reagent and the resulting difficulty in preparing the labelled compounds at high specific activity. The labelling reagents and the preparative method of this invention should overcome this problem. S 35 labelled compounds and I 125 labelled compounds can be used together with advantages in a double autoradiographic technique. A sample is provided in a suitable form for autoradiography, one component is labelled with S 35 and another is labelled with In125. On the sample are laid successively a first photographic film, a sheet of paper and a second photographic film. The first photographic film records radioactive emissions by both S 35 and I q25 The second film records emission of 1 125 only.Thus the location and concentration of two proteins or other species in the sample can be determined in a single autoradiography experiment. The labelling reagent can be used to label receptor ligands for studies of the autoradiographic distribution of receptors in tissue sections. H 3 anc 1 125 are currently being used for studies of this nature, for example,R. Quirion et al Life Sci 33, 227 230 1983 andC. W. Shults et al Peptides 3 1073 1075 1983 . These receptors are present in very low quantities and using 3H ligands autoradiographs need to be exposed for 1 3 months. The higher specific activity and higher beta energy of S 35 0.167 MeV for S 35 compared with 0.0186MeV for H 3 will allow a great reduction in exposure time if a S 35 labelled ligand is used. Intensifying screens are frequently used in the detection of I 125 with a resultant decrease in resolution. Such screens are unnecessary for S 35 so there is no loss in resolution. The following Examples illustrate the invention. Example 1 describes the preparation of a labelling reagent based on methionine. Example 2 describes a method of labelling a protein by reaction with the labelling reagent of Example 1. Example 3 describes a double labelling experiment using S 35 and I 125 labelled proteins. Example 4 describes experiments which demonstrate the improved resolution and shorter exposure times that can be achieved in autoradiography by using S 35 labelled proteins in place of their I 125 counterparts. EXAMPLE 1 S tert Butoxycarbonylmethionine N Hydroxysuccinimide ester 35LR 35 Sulphur Labelling Reagent 35SLR is prepared from 35S methionine in two steps. The amino group of methionine is protected with the tert butoxycarbonyl group BOC , and the acid group of methionine is activated by condensation with N hydroxysuccinimide NHS using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC . The product is purified by HPLC.EMI18.1 MethodTo a stirred aqueous solution of 35S methionine SJ2014, 2 Ci, 50 mCi ml, specific activity SA 1000 Ci mmol in dioxan 30 ml is added triethylamine 100 pl 234 pl ml in dioxan and 2 tert butoxycarbonyl oxyimino 2 phenylacetonitrile BOC ON, 160 sol 500 mg ml in dioxan . The reaction is stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The majority of the dioxan is removed under vacuum on a rotary evaporator and the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate 2 x 10 ml . Ethyl acetate 10 ml and citric acid solution 1.4 ml 5 is added to the aqueous layer, and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 10 min.The organic and aqueous layers are separated and the aqueous layer extracted a further four times with ethyl acetate 4 x 10 ml . The ethyl acetate is completely removed under vacuum and replaced with dry dioxan 40 ml .Nhydroxysuccinimide 7251us 1400 mg ml in dry dioxan is added to the stirred reaction mixture followed by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 160 nl 500mg ml in dioxan . The reaction is stirred at room temperature overnight.The precipitated dicyclohexyl urea is removed by filtration and the remaining solution purified by HPLC. The product was characterized by HPLC and TLC comparisons with an authentic unlabelled sample, which is commercially available, by its performance in a number of labelling reactions as discussed below. Yield 25 . SA 1000 Ci mmol. An oxidized form of the reagent can be obtained using tetrabutylammonium periodate, giving a more stable product that is soluble in water. Labelling reagents derived from cysteine, cysteic acid and cystine may be obtained similarly.

The reaction vessel is cooled in ice and the protein 10 mg ml in phosphate buffer pH 8.6 added. After 30 min. the reaction is terminated with aqueous tyrosine solution 100 Fl 1.8 mg ml .

The products were tested by their performance in protein blotting experiments and compared with the known 125Ilabelled products. EXAMPLE 3 Double Labelling 35S and 125I labelled Protein A and speciesspecific second antibodies provide the opportunity of detecting and distinguishing two antigens in the same sample on a protein blot in a single autoradiography step using two films. Human brain homogenate was electrophoresed on an SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with a monoclonal antibody against tubulin, followed by 35S labelled anti mouse Ig SuCi, specific activity 240 Ci mmol and then probed again with a monoclonal antibody against oitubulin followed by 125I labelled anti mouseIg 5 gCi SA 6600 Ci mmol . The blot was then autoradiographed by placing a film directly over the blot detecting 35S and 125I and therefore rt and ss b tubulin and a second film on top of the first, separated by a paper sheet which only detects 125I and therefore only d tubulin. EXAMPLE 4 Shorter exposure time and resolution To demonstrate the advantages in terms of higher resolution and shorter exposure times using a 35S labelled protein, 35S labelled anti rabbit Ig and 125I labelled anti rabbit Ig were compared in a system using human brain homogenate. Human brain homogenate 200 ug protein was electrophoresed on a SDS polyacrylamide gel and the proteins transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with rabbit antiserum to human cerebrum. The antigen antibody complexes were detected using either 35, labelled anti rabbit Ig 5pCi So 240 Ci mmol or 125I labelled anti rabbit Ig 5 SCi about 1600 Ci mmol .Bands are more clearly resolved when the 35S labelled protein is used. As little as 4 hours exposure time was sufficient, using 35S labelled anti rabbit Ig to obtain clearly resolved bands whereas 16 hours was required using the 125I labelled reagent and an intensifying screen
