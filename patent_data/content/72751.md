# Phase locked loop circuit.

## Abstract
The phase locked loop circuit provides a phase compa rator which receives input signals through a first input terminal, a loop filter which receives a first output and a second output of the phase comparator, and a voltage controlled oscillator which produces output signals of an oscillation frequency proportional to the first output and the second output of the loop filter, the signals corresponding to output signals produced by the voltage controlled oscillator being supplied to a second input terminal of the phase comparator so that the phase of the signals supplied to the first input terminal of the phase comparator is compared with the phase of the signals supplied to the second input terminal. In the present invention. the loop filter comprise a first capacitor connected to the output terminal of the loop filter, a second capacitor and a third capacitor each having a terminal connected to the output terminal of the loop filter, a charging circuit for electrically charging the first, second, and third capacitors, the charging circuit being connected in parallel with the second capacitor, and a discharging circuit for discharging the first, second, and third capacitors, the discharging circuit being connected in parallel with the third capacitor.
