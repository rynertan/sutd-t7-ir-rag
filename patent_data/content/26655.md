## Description
TITANIUM HALIDE MATERIAL AND PRODUCTION THEREOF The present invention relates to titanium halide materials, the preparation of such materials and their use as components of catalyst systems for the polymerisation of olefin monomers, particularly propylene. British Patent Specification 1 286 867 discloses and claims a catalyst system for olefin polymerisation which includes the product obtained by contacting a titanium tetrahalide with a support comprising an anhydrous magnesium halide in an active form. Subsequent to this patent, there have been many proposals for olefin polymerisation catalyst systems including a transition metal composition supported on a magnesium halide. There have also been proposals to use catalyst systems based on the reduction product of a transition metal compound such as titanium tetrachloride with an organo magnesium compound, see for example British Patent Specification 1 299 862. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a titanium halide material having the composition TiClyxMgC12 wherein y has a value of 1.2 to 2.9 and x has a value of at least 4. In this composition, the value of y may be in the range 1.5 to 2.2 and typically approximates to 2.0. It is preferred that x is at least 6 and it is also preferred that x is not more than 10. The titanium halide material is a solid which is typically in the form of discrete, secondary particles which are essentially spherical and are agglomerates of smaller primary particles having a particle size which is such that essentially all the secondary particles have a diameter which is typically from 2 microns up to 30 microns. The material typically has a high surface area and a high porosity. The surface area is the surface area of one gramme of the titanium halide material, the surface area having been measured using the technique ofBS 4359 i. The porosity is the pore volume of pores of diameter less than 300t as measured by nitrogen adsorption using the technique described in Advances in Catalysis , 1957 , Vol IX, pages 143 to 154. The surface area of the titanium halide material is typically at least 200 m2 g, and may be in excess of 300 m2 g, for example up to 400 m2 g. The porosity of the titanium halide material typically is at least 0.40 cm3 g and may be in excess of 0.50 cm3 g, for example up to 0.70 cm3 g. The colour of the titanium halide material varies and is typically violet, although it may be darker in colour, for example a blue black colour. Titanium halide materials, including materials of the type hereinbefore described, may be prepared from titanium tetrachloride by reaction with an organo magnesium compound under specific conditions. Thus, according to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a titanium halide material which process comprises 1 forming a mixture of titanium tetrachloride and a halocarbon compound, which may optionally contain hydrogen, the proportion of halocarbon being at least 10 by volume of the total volume of the mixture 2 reacting this mixture with an organo magnesium material 3 treating the reaction product with titanium tetrachloride and 4 separating a solid product from the titanium tetrachloride. It is preferred to include an additional stage between stages 2 and 3 wherein a solid reaction product is separated from the reaction mixture of stage 2 , drying this solid reaction product and then subjecting the dried solid reaction product to stage 3 . The halocarbon compound is conveniently one in which the halogen is chlorine. The halocarbon compound preferably contains at least three halogen atoms attached to one carbon atom and very preferably contains only carbon and halogen atoms. Examples of the halocarbon compound are chloroform and hexachloroethane and particularly useful results have been obtained using carbon tetrachloride. The proportion of halocarbon compound in the mixture with titanium tetrachloride is preferably at least 258 by volume and useful results have been obtained by forming a mixture containing between 50 and 80 by volume of the halocarbon compound.It will be appreciated that the optimum quantity of halocarbon compound which is used is dependent on a number of factors including the nature of the particular halocarbon compound, the type of organo magnesium material which is reacted with the mixture and the proportion of the organomagnesium material which is used. The mixture of titanium tetrachloride and the halocarbon compound is conveniently formed by mixing the two materials together in the absence of any solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbon liquids. Thus, the mixing is conveniently effected at a temperature at which both materials are in the liquid state and a suitable temperature for effecting the mixing is ambient temperature 15 30 C , although lower or higher temperatures can be used if desired. The organo magnesium material which is reacted with the mixture of titanium tetrachloride and the halocarbon compound may be a dihydrocarbyl magnesium compound, a hydrocarbyl magnesium halide compound or a mixed magnesium aluminium hydrocarbyl compound. Preferably the magnesium compound is soluble in hydrocarbon solvents. Examples of suitable organo magnesium materials include magnesium dibutyl, which is preferably a mixture of n butyl and sec butyl magnesium, magnesium didodecyl, octyl magnesium bromide, octyl magnesium chloride and magnesium aluminium ethyl compositions such as, for example, Mg AlEt4 2.The organo magnesium material may have associated with it a Lewis Base compound such as an ether but it is preferred that any such Lewis Base is present in a relatively small proportion, for example less than 0.4 mole for each mole of the organo magnesium material. The proportions of the organo magnesium material which are reacted with the mixture of titanium tetrachloride and the halocarbon compound may be varied over a considerable range. Thus, it is possible to react the organo magnesium material with a substantial excess of the mixture but it will be appreciated that, with an appropriate adjustment of the proportions of the components of the mixture, the organomagnesium material may be added in a quantity sufficient to give essentially complete reaction of the components of the mixture. The reaction of the organo magnesium material with the mixture is conveniently, but not necessarily, effected by adding the organo magnesium material to the mixture. The organo magnesium material is conveniently used as a solution in a suitable inert solvent, particularly an aliphatic or aromatic solvent such as hexane, heptane or toluene. The reaction is conveniently effected at ambient temperature but, depending on the reactants, particularly the halocarbon compound, higher or lower temperatures may be used. When the halocarbon compound is carbon tetrachloride, elevated temperatures of 70 C, or even higher, may be used. The reaction of the organo magnesium material with the mixture is conveniently effected by stirring all the materials together at the desired reaction temperature for a period of at least 5 minutes, preferably for at least 30 minutes and, in general, it is not necessary to use a time in excess of four hours. The product of the reaction between the organomagnesium material and the mixture contains a solid product which is typically brownish in colour. This solid product contains magnesium, titanium and halogen. The solid product, or the reaction mixture containing the solid product, is then treated with titanium tetrachloride. The treatment with titanium tetrachloride can be effected by mixing the solid product, or the reaction mixture containing the solid product, with the titanium tetrachloride. The treatment is conveniently effected using neat titanium tetrachloride. If the preferred, optional separation and drying stage has been effected, the treatment is conveniently effected by suspending the dried solid product in neat titanium tetrachloride. The treatment is preferably effected at a temperature of at least 600C and temperatures of up to 1500C can be used.It is particularly preferred to use a treatment temperature in the range 80 C up to 1200C. The treatment is conveniently effected by mixing the solid product and the titanium tetrachloride at ambient temperature and thereafter heating the mixture to a temperature of at least 60 C. The time of the treatment is dependent on the temperature used and conveniently the temperature of at least 60 C is maintained for at least 30 minutes up to 24 hours, for example 1 to 5 hours.During the course of the treatment with titanium tetrachloride, the colour of the solid product will usually undergo a change to a red violet, or even darker, colour. The product obtained is finally separated from the titanium tetrachloride, for example by filtration or decantation. To remove any adsorbed titanium tetrachloride from the solid material, the material may then be washed several times or may be subjected to a drying process, or may be subjected to both procedures. In the preferred, optional additional stage, the solid reaction product obtained in stage 2 is separated and dried. The solid reaction product is separated from the reaction mixture of stage 2 by.any suitable technique, for example by filtration or decantation. It is preferred that the solid product is then washed several times to remove any residual unreacted materials from the solid. The solid is then dried and this drying may be effected either by passing a stream of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon through the solid, conveniently at ambient temperature, although lower or higher temperatures for example up to 1200C may be used, or by heating the material at a moderate temperature, preferably not exceeding about 600C, at a reduced pressure, for example not greater than about 10 mm mercury. The drying is preferably effected for several hours, for example 2 to 24 hours.Adequate drying can usually be achieved by passing a stream of nitrogen at ambient temperature through the solid for a time of 16 hours. It is preferred that the drying is sufficient to give a free flowing powder. A Lewis Base compound may be incorporated into the titanium halide material at one or more of the various stages during the preparation of the material. Thus, the reaction between the mixture of the halocarbon and the titanium tetrachloride with the organo magnesium compound may be effected in the presence of a Lewis Base compound, which may be present as a liquid medium.in which the reaction occurs, or dissolved in the liquid reaction medium or complexed with one or more of the reagents, used in the reaction. Alternatively, the Lewis Base compound may be added subsequent to the production of the reaction product, either before or after the treatment with the titanium tetrachloride or before or after the optional drying step.The Lewis Base compound may be added by suspending the reaction product in a liquid medium which is, or which contains, the Lewis Base compound and stirring the mixture at any convenient temperature, typically not more than 100 C, for a length of time sufficient for at least some of the Lewis Base compound to be incorporated into the reaction product. An alternative procedure for incorporating a Lewis Base compound into the reaction product when the reaction product is a solid is to grind this solid in the presence of the Lewis Base compound. The Lewis Base compound which may be incorporated into the titanium halide material can be any Lewis Base compound, especially organic Lewis Base compound, which has previously been proposed for use in an olefin polymerisation catalyst system. Thus, the Lewis Base compound may be an ether, an ester, a ketone, an alcohol, an ortho ester, a thioether, a thioester, a thioketone, a thiol, a sulphone, a sulphonamide, a fused ring compound containing a heterocyclic sulphur atom, an organic silicon compound such as a silane or siloxane, an amide such as formamide, urea and the substituted derivatives thereof such as tetramethylurea, thiourea, an alkanolamine, an amine, a cyclic amine such as pyridine or quinoline, a diamine such as tetramethylethylenediamine or an organic phosphorus compound such as an organic phosphine, an organic phosphine oxide, an organic phosphite or an organic phosphate. The use of organic Lewis Base compounds is disclosed, inter alia, in British PatentSpecifications 803 198, 809 717, 880 998, 896 509, 920 118, 921 954, 933 236, 940 125, 966 025, 969 074, 971 248, 1 013 363, 1 017 977, 1 049 723, 1 122 010, 1 150 845, 1 208 815, 1 234 657, 1 324 173, 1 359 328, 1 383 207, 1 423 658, 1 423 659 and 1 423 660. Titanium halide materials in accordance with the present invention are conveniently prepared by a process which comprises 1 forming a mixture of titanium tetrachloride and carbon tetrachloride in which the carbon tetrachloride forms from 25 up to 80 by volume of the total volume of the mixture 2 adding to the mixture a solution, in an inert liquid, of a dihydrocarbyl magnesium compound to give reaction with the components of the mixture 3 separating from the reaction mixture a solid reaction product, washing and drying the said solid reaction product, 4 suspending the dried solid reaction product in undiluted titanium tetrachloride and heating the suspension to maintain a temperature in the range 80 to 1200C for 1 to 5 hours and 5 separating the solid from the titanium tetrachloride and washing the solid to remove adsorbed titanium tetrachloride. The titanium halide material is suitable for use as a component of an olefin polymerisation catalyst, and for this purpose may be used in the absence of any suspending medium or may be suspended in a suitable inert hydrocarbon material such as hexane or a mixture of dodecane isomers and in either case can then be used together with other compounds which are known for this purpose, to effect the polymerisation of an olefin monomer. As a further aspect of the present invention there is provided an olefin polymerisation catalyst system which is obtained by mixing together 1 a titanium halide material containing titanium, magnesium and halogen atoms as hereinbefore described and 2 at least one organometallic compound of aluminum, or of a non transition metal of Group IIA of the Periodic Table, or a complex of an organo metallic compound of a non transition metal ofGroup IA or IIA with an organo metallic compound of aluminium. The organo metallic component of the catalyst system is conveniently an organo aluminium compound and is particularly an organo aluminium compound containing only hydrocarbyl groups. Thus1 suitable organo aluminium compounds include triethyl aluminium, tributyl aluminium and trioctyl aluminium. In addition to the titanium halide material and the organo metallic compound, the catalyst system can contain other components such as are known in the art. Typically the catalyst system may include at least one Lewis Base component. The Lewis Base component may be one of the many Lewis Base compounds which have been proposed for this purpose and which affect the activity and or stereospecificity of the Ziegler polymerisation catalyst system.Thus, the Lewis Base compound may be an ether, an alcohol, a ketone, an ester, a thioether, a thioketone, a thiol, a thioester, a sulphone, a sulphonamide, a fused ring compound containing a heterocyclic sulphur atom, an amine, an amide, an organic silicon compound such as a silane or a siloxane or an organic compound of phosphorus, such as an organic phosphine, an organic phosphine oxide, an organic phosphite or an organic phosphate. Useful catalyst systems can be obtained by using, as the LewisBase component, esters, particularly aromatic esters such as ethyl benzoate and ethyl anisate. The catalyst system may also include other components which affect the characteristics of the system, particular examples of which are the cyclic polyenes such as cycloheptatriene, cyclooctatetraene, cyclooctatriene and the derivatives thereof including the alkyl and alkoxysubstituted derivatives tropylium salts and complexes tropolone and tropone. The proportions of the various catalyst components can be varied quite widely as is known in the art.Typically, the amount of the organo metallic compound will be at least 1 mole for each gramme atom of titanium which is present in the titanium halide material. Preferably the amount of the organo metallic compound does not exceed 1000 moles for each gramme atom of titanium and it is particularly preferred that the amount of the organometallic compound does not exceed 100 moles for each gramme atom of titanium. If the catalyst system includes a Lewis Base component, this is conveniently present in an amount of from 0.1 up to 1.0 mole for each mole of the organo metallic component of the catalyst system. Any polyene which may be present in the catalyst system is preferably present in an amount of not greater than the molar proportion of the organo metallic component of the catalyst system. The catalyst components may be mixed together in the presence or absence of the olefin monomer, or monomer mixture, which is to be polymerised. If mixing is effected in the presence of the monomer, or monomer mixture, to be polymerised, it is preferred either that the amount of monomer, or monomer mixture, present is relatively small whereby only a small proportion of polymer is formed, for example up to 10 moles for each gramme atom of titanium, or alternatively that the mixing is effected in the polymerisation vessel. If the catalyst is obtained by mixing together more than two components, it may be convenient to pre mix some of the catalyst components and complete the mixing in the polymerisation vessel.In effecting the mixing of the catalyst components, it is preferred that any Lewis Base compound which is present is added to the titanium halide material only in the presence of the organo metallic compound which is component 2 of the catalyst. Any LewisBase compound which is present may be pre mixed with the organo metallic compound which is component 2 of the catalyst and this mixture may then be mixed with the titanium halide material, conveniently within the polymerisation vessel. Catalyst systems obtained in accordance with the present invention are suitable for the polymerisation and copolymerisation of olefin monomers. Thus, as a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the production of a polymer or copolymer of an olefin monomer wherein at least one olefin monomer is contacted under polymerisation conditions with an olefin polymerisation catalyst as hereinbefore defined. Any olefin monomer which is capable of being polymerised using a Ziegler catalyst system may be polymerised by the process of the present invention.Thus, monomers which can be polymerised by the present process include ethylene, butene l, hexene l and 4 methylpentene 1 and particularly propylene. These olefins, for example ethylene and a minor proportion of butene l or hexene l, may be copolymerised together.A particularly preferred copolymerisation is that of propylene with a minor proportion of ethylene, conveniently using a sequential polymerisation process such as is described in British Patent Specifications 970 478 970 479 and 1 014 944. The process of the present invention is particularly useful for the polymerisation of propylene to give a high yield of polymer relative to the amount of transition metal composition used. It is well known that catalysts of the Ziegler type, such as the present catalyst system, are susceptible to the effects of impurities in the reaction medium.Thus, the activity and stereospecificity of the catalyst can be effected by the presence of small quantities of impurities, particularly oxygen and polar compounds such as water and alcohol, in the monomer and any diluent which may be used. Hence, it is desirable to use pure monomers and diluents and with catalysts of high activity it is especially desirable to use materials having a high degree of purity. Accordingly, rather than using materials of commercial purity, it may be found desirable to purify these further. The purification may be effected in more than one stage if desired and the particular purification treatment used will be dependent on the purity of the starting materials.Satisfactory purity can be achieved in most cases by passing the monomer, and any diluent which may be used, through a bed of a material which is capable of absorbing the impurities contained in the monomer or diluent. Suitable techniques of achieving a satisfactory purity are described in British PatentSpecifications 1 111 493 and 1 226 659. The level of impurities in the monomer or diluent are preferably less than a total. of 20 ppm parts per million by weight and in particular it is preferred that the monomer contains less than 1 ppm by volume of water and less than 1 ppm by volume of oxygen. The polymerisation process can be carried out in the presence or absence of an inert diluent such as a suitably purified paraffinic hydrocarbon. If a diluent is not used for the polymerisation, an excess of liquid monomer can be used as the suspension medium for the catalyst and polymer product. Alternatively, polymerisation can be effected using a gaseous monomer in contact with the solid phase comprising the catalyst system and thev polymer product, such a process being effected using any technique which is suitable for carrying out a gas solid reaction, for example a fluidised bed reactor system, a stirred bed reactor system or a ribbon blender type of reactor. The polymerisation process may be effected either in a batch manner or on a continuous basis. The catalyst components may be introduced into the polymerisation vessel separately but it may be preferred, particularly if polymerisation is being effected on the continuous basis, to premix all of the catalyst components together before they are introduced into the polymerisation reactor.However, as noted, if the catalyst system contains a LewisBase component, it is preferred to pre mix the Lewis Base compound with the organo metallic component of the catalyst system before the titanium halide material is added to complete the catalyst system. The polymerisation can be effected under conditions of temperature and pressure which have been used previously for olefin polymerisation processes. Thus, the polymerisation may be effected at temperatures of 0 C and upwards, for example up to 250 C. However, for the polymerisation of propylene, it is preferred to operate at moderately low temperatures and thus temperatures in the range from 40 C up to 100 C, preferably not more than about 800C are preferred. The polymerisation is conveniently effected at an elevated pressure which is typically not more than 100kg cmê, and especially is in the range from 5 up to 40 kg cm2. The polymerisation can be effected in the presence of a chain transfer agent such as a zinc dialkyl or particularly hydrogen, in order to control the molecular weight of the product formed. The proportion of the chain transfer agent will be dependent on the polymerisation conditions and in particular on the polymerisation temperature, and for the polymerisation of propylene is typically not more than 5 molar relative to the amount of monomer, and particularly is in the range from 0.01 up to 28 molar relative to the monomer or monomers.However, if the monomer being polymerised is ethylene, or a mixture in which ethylene is the major polymerisable component by moles , the amount of hydrogen used may be greater, for example in the homopolymerisation of ethylene the reaction mixture may contain in excess of 50 molar of hydrogen, whereas if ethylene is being copolymerised, a proportion of hydrogen which is typically up to 35 molar may be sufficient. It will be appreciated that the preparation of the transition metal composition, the production of the polymerisation catalyst and the olefin polymerisation process are effected in an inert atmosphere which is conveniently nitrogen which is essentially free from impurities such as oxygen and water vapour. Various aspects of the present invention will now be described with reference to the following Examples which are illustrative of the invention. In the followingExamples all the operations were effected under an atmosphere of nitrogen unless otherwise indicated. The nitrogen used was White Spot grade from the British OxygenCompany which had been further purified by passing through a column containing BASF catalyst R3 ll cupric oxide reduced to finely divided metallic copper on a magnesium oxide support and then through a column containing pellets of Union Carbide 4A molecular sieve, all stages being effected at ambient temperature. EXAMPLES 1 TO 4 To 30 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride was added carbon tetrachloride in the amounts indicated in Table 1.To the mixture obtained were slowly added 25 cm3 of a 0.625 molar solution of a mixture of magnesium dibutyl isomers in approximately equimolar quantities of n butyl and sec butyl groups in an isoparaffin fraction, essentially all of which had a boiling temperature in the range 117 C to 1350C whilst stirring the mixture. The addition of the magnesium dibutyl was effected at ambient temperature over a period of one to two minutes, stirring of the reaction mixture was continued for 45 minutes and was then terminated. The solid was allowed to settle and the liquid phase was filtered off. The solid was then washed 3 times using 100 cm3 of n heptane at ambient temperature for each wash. For comparative purposes, a sample corresponding to about half of the washed solid was suspended in 100 cm3 n heptane and tested without further treatment. The remaining half of the solid was thoroughly dried by passing a stream of nitrogen, at ambient temperature, through the solid at a rate of 15 litres hour for 16 hours. The dried solid was then suspended in 30 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride, the suspension was stirred and heated to a temperature of 1200C. The temperature of 1200C was maintained for 3 hours and then heating and stirring were terminated. The mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and then filtered. The solid was then washed 3 times using 100 cm3 of n heptane at ambient temperature for each wash. The washed solid was then suspended in 100 cm3 of n heptane. 50 cm3 aliquots of the suspensions obtained as described a 25 cm3 aliquot was used for ComparativeExample B were extracted with 6N aqueous sulphuric acid.The aqueous layers were then made up to 100 cm3 by the addition of distilled water and subjected to elemental analysis for magnesium, titanium and chlorine.

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE E A 300 cm3 vessel with a stirrer and No. 2 porosity glass sinter for filtration was evacuated and filled with an atmosphere of dry hydrogen chloride gas. A positive pressure of hydrogen chloride was maintained in the apparatus throughout the experiment. 96 cm3 of dry n heptane were then added, followed by 3.4 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride and this mixture was constantly stirred. 25 cm of the 0.625 molar solution of the mixture of magnesium dibutyl isomers as described forExamples 1 to 4 were added slowly and allowed to fall through the hydrogen chloride atmosphere before reaching the mixture of n heptane and titanium tetrachloride. A brown precipitate was formed and a large temperature rise observed.The solid was filtered and washed three times with 100 cm3 of n heptane, the hydrogen chloride atmosphere being replaced by purging with pure nitrogen for the washing steps. The solid was finally suspended in 100 cm3 of heptane.

EXAMPLES 5 TO 8 Propylene was polymerised using the products ofExamples 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples A to J. The propylene used for the polymerisation had been purified by passing gaseous propylene in turn through a column 7.6 cm in diameter, 0.9 m in length containing 1.6 mm granules of Alcoa F1 alumina at 50 600C, and then through a similar column containing BASF catalyst R3 11 cupric oxide reduced to finely divided metallic copper on a magnesium oxide support at 40 500C, condensing the issue gas and passing the liquid propylene through four columns all 7.6 cm in diameter two of 0.9 m in length, two of 1.8 m in length at 25 C, each containing 1.6 mm pellets of Union Carbide 3A molecular sieves. This treatment reduced the water content of the monomer from 5 10 ppm by volume to c1 ppm by volume and the oxygen content from 1 2 ppm by volume to 0.5 ppm by volume. The level of inert compounds nitrogen, ethane, etc was unchanged at 0.3 and the level of unsaturated hydrocarbons allene, methyl acetylene etc was unchanged at 1 ppm. A polymerisation flask equipped with efficient stirrer and a water jacket was dried carefully and 1 litre of an inert hydrocarbon diluent a C7 fraction, essentially all of which had a boiling point in the range 99 102 C was introduced. The diluent was evacuated at 40 C, purged with nitrogen and evacuated, which treatment reduced the water and oxygen contents of the diluent. The diluent was then saturated with the purified propylene to one atmosphere pressure. 10 millimoles of tri isobutyl aluminium were introduced into the polymerisation flask. After about 20 minutes, a quantity of a titanium chloride material, obtained as described inExamples 1 to 4 and Comparative Examples A to J, was introduced into the polymerisation flask. The pressure in the polymerisation flask was maintained at one atmosphere by supply of propylene. After a period of 3 hours from the introduction of the titanium chloride material, the run was terminated with 2 cm3 of isopropanol and 2 cm3 of propylene oxide, and a sample of supernatant liquid extracted for determining the concentration of soluble polymer dissolved in the polymerisation diluent.The remaining mixture was then subjected to steam distillation and the solid obtained was dried in a vacuum oven pressure less than 10 mm of mercury at 800C until constant weight was achieved at least 12 hours .

EXAMPLE 9 The procedure of Example 3 was repeated with the exception that 50 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride were used. EXAMPLES 10 TO 15 The polymerisation procedure described for Examples 5 to 8 was repeated using the product of Example 9 with the following modifications. The polymerisation diluent was an aliphatic hydrocarbon fraction consisting predominantly of dodecane isomers, essentially all of which had a boiling point in the range 1700C to 1850C. The polymerisation was effected at 60 C. The organo aluminium component of the catalyst system was triethyl aluminium in an amount of 8 millimoles. In some of the polymerisations, as indicated in Table 4, ethyl anisate was also present as a catalyst component which was mixed with the triethyl aluminium, in the polymerisation vessel in the presence of propylene, for 10 minutes before adding the titanium chloride material.

EXAMPLE 16 The procedure of Examples 1 to 4 was repeated with the following variations. A mixture of 15 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride and 15 cm3 of carbon tetrachloride was used. The mixture was heated to 700C and 25 cm3 of a 0.65 M solution of the magnesium dibutyl isomers was added. After filtering and washing as inExamples 1 to 4, the solid was suspended in 200 cm3 of heptane. The suspension was divided into two 100 cm3 portions. One portion of the suspension was filtered and dried as described in Examples 1 to 4 and the dry solid was suspended in 35 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride. The suspension was heated to 1200C and maintained at that temperature for 3 hours. The suspension was filtered and the solid washed and finally suspended in 100 cm3 of heptane. EXAMPLE 17 The product of Example 16 was used to effect the polymerisation of ethylene. The polymerisation conditions were as described in Examples 5 to 8 but used ethylene rather than propylene, 1.3 cm3 of triethyl aluminium rather than tri isobutyl aluminium , and sufficient of the product of Example 16 to provide 0.1 mM of titanium.After 3 hours polymerisation, 38.9 grammes of polyethylene were obtained. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE U The procedure of Example 16 was repeated up to the separation of the suspension of the intermediate product into two 100 cm3 portions with the exception that the reaction between the titanium tetrachloride, carbon tetrachloride and magnesium dibutyl was effected at ambient temperature. One of the separated 100 cm3 portions was subjected to no further treatment and will be referred to as titanium chloride U. EXAMPLE 18 The remaining 100 cm3 portion obtained inComparative Example U was filtered, dried, treated with titanium tetrachloride, washed and resuspended as described in the latter part of Example 16. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE V The procedure of Comparative Example U was repeated with the exception that only titanium tetrachloride and magnesium dibutyl were reacted together, and no carbon tetrachloride was used. The surface areas and porosities of the products ofComparative Examples U and V and Example 18 were determined. The results are set out in Table 5.

The liquid was stirred. 2.87 cm3 of ethyl benzoate were added, followed by 3.0 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride. A bright yellow precipitate formed. After 10 minutes, there were added 45 cm3 of a 0.66 molar solution of the magnesium dibutyl isomers in the heptane fraction used inExample 17.The precipitate turned light green and the temperature rose to 65 C without applying external heating . The mixture was filtered, washed three times using 100 cm3 of the heptane fraction for each wash and sufficient of the heptane fraction was added to give a total volume of 100 cm3. EXAMPLE 19 The procedure of Comparative Example W was repeated, with the exception that the washed solid was not finally resuspended but was treated as described hereafter. The solid was dried in a stream of pure argon for 19.5 hours, then heated to 1200C at which temperature, 30 cm3 of titanium tetrachloride were added, still under argon. After 3 hours at 1200C the mixture was cooled, filtered and the solid washed three times using 100 cm3 of the heptane fraction for each wash. The solid was then suspended in 100 cm3 of the heptane fraction.

The procedure of Example 19 was repeated with the exception that ethyl benzoate was not used Example 20 . EXAMPLES 21 AND 22 The polymerisation procedure of Examples 5 to 8 was repeated using the products of Examples 19 and 20 andComparative Examples W and X, with the exceptions that different quantities of the titanium chloride and different polymerisation times were used.
