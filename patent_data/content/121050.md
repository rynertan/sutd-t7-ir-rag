# Plastic container lid with tearaway tamper resistant sealing strip.

## Abstract
A plastic container and a one piece molded plastic lid for the container are provided with a tamper resistant, hermetic seal. The lid includes a top wall 18 and a surrounding depending sidewall. The sidewall has a thin upper web upper portion and a relatively thick lower skirt portion 24 . The mouth of the container includes a circumferential lip 14 . The thin web deforms as the lid is snap fitted onto the container. The deformable web stretches into close conformity and seal ing engagement with the lip 14 of the container, the lower skirt region 24 of the lid maintaining the web in a tightly constricted configuration about the lip 14 . The skirt is sealed to the sidewall 10 of the plastic container by a circumferen tial sealing strip 30 formed integrally with and extending downwardly from the lower edge of the lid skirt. The lower portion 34 of the sealing strip 30 is attached directly to the sidewall 10 of the plastic container by adhesive or welding. The connections between the sealing strip 30 and both the container and the lower edge of the skirt of the lid are narrow to define weakened tear lines. A portion of the tear strip 30 is formed to protrude and define a starter tab which may be gripped easily by the user to initiate tearing of the tear strip 30 .
