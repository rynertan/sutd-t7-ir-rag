# Separation of chlorosilanes.

## Abstract
An improved method for the separation of close boiling chlorosilanes is described. The method consists of the extractive distillation of the close boiling chlorosilanes using sulfolane as the extractive solvent and thereafter separating the higher boiling chlorosilane and sulfolane by distilling the higher boiling chlorosilane from the higher boiling chlorosi lane and sulfolane mixture to which is added a hydrocarbon solvent. Preferred hydrocarbon solvents include normal heptane, normal nonane, and 2,2,4 trimethylpentane. The sulfolane obtained from the higher boiling chlorosilane and sulfolane mixture is suitable for recycling to the extractive distillation process as the sulfolane contains only limited amounts of dissolved chlorosilane.
