# Integral reagent dispenser.

## Abstract
An integral reagent dispenser comprises a reagent dis penser component provided with a reagent dispenser well 75 having an opening adapted to present a liquid reagent R1 for withdrawal therethrough and means to position a lens 100 of liquid, immiscible with said reagent, between the reagent and the opening of said well. For example, the dispenser can have suitable dimensions and an inner surface 77 which combine with the wetting characteristics of the reagent to form a con cave reagent meniscus 97 suitable to reliably position a lens of immiscible liquid thereon. The sens so formed is centrally located by the concave shape of the meniscus. Preferably, the reagent dispenser further includes an integrally associated source of reagent 30 .
