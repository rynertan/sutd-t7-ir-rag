# A shock absorber.

## Abstract
A mechanical, vibration preventing means to be used on mechanical and hydraulic presses, bar cutters, shearing machines and the like preferably cyclicly working machine tools with a pulse like pressing process is adapted to absorb the stroke at punching and cutting in plates, bars, and the like articles of metal, plastics or another material by the resilient energy deriving from the deflection of the machine frame instead of being converted into vibrations and noise immedi ately after break through of the material being converted directly into rotational energy in a flywheel through a roller screw connection. This roller screw connection transforms the translatory movement of the machine tools into rotation. A free engine clutch ensures that the flywheel acceler ated as a consequence of the above procedure does not start to pull at the structure of the machine during the reverse movement of the machine tool by a force almost as great as the process force immediately before the energy is received by the flywheel, because only very few machine tools of the above type can bear such tensile forces. The energy supplied to the flywheel is subsequently dissipated either electrically, mechanically or viscously be fore the next cycle of the machine. The vibration preventing properties of such an inertial shock absorber are based on a function as a blocking mass in usual structure dynamic respect, where the actual physical mass merely can be maintained on a practical, suitably low level by means of mass transforming mechanical compo nents and thereby make the inertial shock absorber suited for use even on structures so rigid and heavy as frames of machine tools.
