## Description
CONTINUOUS POLYMERIZATION PROCESS FOR PREPARINGPOLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS OF ETHYLENICALLY UNSATURATED WATER SOLUBLE MONOMERS. This invention relates to a process for the preparation of water soluble polymers. More particularly, this invention relates to a continuous polymerization process for the preparation of water soluble polymers which utilizes a visible light initiation system, and to a continuous polymerization process for the preparation of water soluble polymers which utilizes a combined visible light and thermal initiation system. Many processes are known in the prior art for the preparation of water soluble polymers. For example, water soluble polymers have been prepared in solution, in suspension and in emulsion using chemical initiators. These processes, however, generally result in low conversion, low concentration of product and a lack of uniformity of product quality. In addition, various other polymerization processes have been proposed, as for example, photopolymerization processes such as those disclosed inU.S. Patent Nos. 2,850,445 2,880,152 and 2,880,153, and high energy irradition processes such as is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,926,756. The above referenced processes, however, suffer from a variety of disadvantages, such as high capital cost, low conversion, high energy requirements, low initial monomer concentration and numerous other problems. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of watersoluble polymers that permits use of high monomer concentrations. It is a further object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of watersoluble polymers that eliminates the need of nitrogen purging to remove oxygen from the system. It is an additional object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of watersoluble polymers which permits good control over the reaction exotherm. It is a still further object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of watersoluble polymers that reduces capital requirements and operating costs. It is another object of this invention to provide a process for the preparation of watersoluble polymers that reduces energy requirements and increases the conversion of monomer to polymer. These and other objects of this invention are accomplished by a process in which a visible light activated continuous polymerization system is used. The process of the present invention may be used to polymerize one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as acrylamide, acrylic acid, quaternary ammonium compounds or the corresponding free amine, such as methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, methacryloyloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium methyl sulfate, methacrylamido 3 propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, 3 acrylamido 3 methyl butyl trimethyl ammonium chloride or 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid. The process may be used to prepare the free acid or the water soluble salts of any of the aforementioned monomers. Aqueous monomer solutions are prepared and the monomer solution fed to the polymerization apparatus at a concentration in the range of from 25 to 75 percent, preferably 40 to 60 percent by weight.Polymers having molecular weights of at least 50,000, and preferably at least 1,000,000, as measured by viscometry, may be prepared by the process of this invention. These polymers may be dried and dissolved in water for use by a variety of conventional techniques. As previously mentioned, the polymerization process of this invention is initiated by visible light or by a combination of visible light and one or more thermal initiators. Visible light may be defined as light having a wavelength in the range of approximately 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. Accordingly, any photoreducible dye and weak reducing agent may be used. Suitable photoreducible dyes include thiazines such as methylene blue, thionene and methylene green, isoalloxazines and riboflavin or phthaleins such as eosin and rhodamine B. Suitable reducing agents include amines such as triethanolamine and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, alcohols such as n butanol, propylene glycol and glycerine, and sulfur compounds such as sodium metabisulfite. The preferred system is a mixture of methylene blue and triethanolamine in a molar ratio of 0.0000025 to 1, preferably 0.0005 to 0.002. The use of a thermal initiator in conjunction with the visible light initiator enables the lights to be shut off after polymerization has been initiated and the exotherm has raised the temperature of the partially polymerized reaction media to a level sufficient to activate the thermal initiator. This reduces the energy requirements and permits higher conversion of monomer to polymer.When the process of this invention is carried out continuously, this permits the use of a smaller bank of lights. Suitable thermal initiators include free radical initiators such as ammonium persulfate, organic peroxides and azo compounds as, for example, azobisisobutyronitrile or 4 azobiscyanovaleric acid.The thermal initiator should be present in a concen tration of from 1 x lo moles per liter to 1 x Ixl moles per liter, more preferably from 1.0 x 10 4 moles per liter to 1 x 10 moles per liter. The polymerization process of the present invention is continuous and is preferably carried out on a continuous belt which is driven by two spaced apart rotating drums. The belt may be stainless steel or plastic and is preferably release coated with a suitable agent. Lights are positioned over the belt in such a manner as to provide the desired light intensity to the monomer initiator mixture which is fed, at the desired thickness, onto the surface of the belt. Cooling or heating water may be sprayed against the underside of the belt to control the reaction temperature and the belt speed may be varied to control the reaction time. The polymerization process of the present invention does not require a nitrogen purge. It may be carried out in an oxygen containing environment such as air or in an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon, if desired. Suitable light intensities include those in the range of 1000 to 10,000 foot candles, preferably 4000 to 10,000 foot candles, and may be supplied by any suitable source, as for example, incandescent floodlights. Initiation temperatures should be in the range of 50C. to 450C., preferably l00C. to 250C., and film thickness should be in the range of 1 8 inch to 1 inch, preferably 1 4 inch to 1 2 inch, while reaction time should be in the range of 5 minutes to 120 minutes, preferably 40 minutes to 70 minutes, and pH should generally be in the range of 3.0 to 10.0, preferably 6.0 to 9.0. The polymers produced in accordance with the process of the present invention may be recovered by conventional means. They may be dried, partially or completely, by known techniques to produce a gel or particulate product. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that these parameters will vary somewhat depending on the particular polymers being produced in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. The process of the present invention may be illustrated by the following representative examples. EXAMPLE 1 A polymerization apparatus which comprises a continuous belt was adapted for photopolymerization by encasing the belt in a plywood box 12 feet long .Three rows of lights were installed in the box on 5 1 4 inch centers at a distance from the belt which results in a light intensity of 3000 to 4000 foot candles. The apparatus was equipped with cooling facilities on the underside of the belt.

The monomer mix was fed to the moving belt in a fashion to give a film having a thickness of 3 8 inch, while the lights were turned on and cooling was applied. As the monomer mix travelled the length of the belt, initiation was observed by an increase in temperature and color disappearance.Polymer formation was noted by the formation of a thick gel sheet. Temperature increased from 100C. to a maximum of 800C. The polymer sheet which exited the belt was ground and dried in a vacuum oven.

A 0.1 percent solution had a Brookfield viscosity No. 1 spindle at 30 rpm on Model LVF of 124 cps. Measurement of friction reduction performance showed the polymer equivalent to commercial products. EXAMPLE 5 A polymerization apparatus which comprises a continuous belt was adapted for photopolymerization by encasing the belt in a plywood box 12 feet long .Three rows of lights were installed in the box on 5 1 4 inch centers at a distance from the belt which results in a light intensity of 3000 to 4000 foot candles. The apparatus was equipped with cooling facilities on the underside of the belt. Acrylamide 73.63 pounds and deionized water were charged to a 50 gallon mix tank.

The monomer mix was fed to the moving belt in a fashion to give a film thickness of 3 8 inch. As the monomer solution entered the belt, a solution of 4,4 azobis 4 cyanovaleric acid 14.0 g in deionized water 100 g at pH 6.5 was added to it. The ratio of initiator solution to monomer solution was 0.008 g g.As the monomer solution entered the belt, the lights were turned on and cooling applied.
