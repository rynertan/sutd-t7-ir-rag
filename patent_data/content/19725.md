# Deposition method using an energetic particle beam.

## Abstract
An energetic particle beam 11 is accelerated towards a sputtering target. The target is located at an angle to the path of the beam although it need not be . The target material 10 which is dislodged by the ion beam can be directed towards a substrate 12 . The material is composed of atoms forming both positive and negative ions. The voltage difference between the target and the substrate can be adjusted to be positive or negative so that either positive ions or negative ions can be accelerated to the substrate by means of adjusting the target substrate voltage difference. In addition, means 13 can be provided for collecting electrons included with the ions moving towards and away from the target. The advantage here is that the sputter deposition makes it possible to deposit positive and negative ions alternately or in a desired graded mixture at an interface under gradually changing voltage control.
