# Semiconductor integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit device comprises a semi conductor substrate 40 of one conduction type, an epitaxial layer 41 of opposite conduction type formed on the semiconductor substrate 40 , buried layer 42 of oppo site conduction type located between the semiconductor substrate 40 and the epitaxial layer 41 and at least one circuit element 45, 46, 47, 48 formed in the epitaxial layer 41 above the buried layer 42 . The integrated circuit device also includes a first isola tion region 43 which surrounds and is spaced from the buried layer 42 and extends from the surface of the epitax ial layer 41 into the substrate, the at least one circuit ele ment being formed in the epitaxial layer 41 surrounded by the first isolation region 43 , and a second isolation region 44 located wtihin the first isolation region 43 extends from the surface of the epitaxial layer 41 into the buried layer 42 , at least one circuit element being surrounded by the second isolation region 44 .
