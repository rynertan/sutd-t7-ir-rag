# Portable fluid infusion apparatus.

## Abstract
A portable infusion device includes a disposable syringe 32 which is located in a removable portion 14 of a compact package that comprises the device. In order to conserve space, a flexible piston rod assembly is provided wherein the syringe plunger head 34 is connected to a thin flexible plunger stem 36 which is reversely bent about the upstream end of the syringe body so that the outer end of the stem lies directly adja cent and parallel to the syringe body. A small motor 20 lo cated in the permanent portion 12 of the package drives the plunger through a screw 22 which sequentially engages closely spaced teeth 50 on the face of the plunger stem as it moves along the outer surface of the syringe. When the syringe contents have been discharged, the removable section 14 , in cluding the syringe and plunger stem assembly, can be readily removed and replaced.
