# Aminopyrine improved Trinder s reagent and dosing process for hydrogen peroxide from enzimatic oxidation of metabolic substrata with the same.

## Abstract
An aminopyrine improved Trinder s reagent is disclosed to be used for the dosing of hydrogen peroxide from enzyma tic oxidation of metabolic substrata, such as glucose, choles terol, uric acid, tryglycerides and coline. The use of such an improved reagent in Trinder s reaction enables to avoid any interference from bilirubin, particularly in the determination of fric acid. The dosing process for uric acid is also disclosed by means of such a reagent.
