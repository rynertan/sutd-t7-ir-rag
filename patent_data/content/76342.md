## Description
A COLOR DEVELOPER SHEET FOR CARBONLESS COPYING This invention provides a color developer sheet for carbonless copying, and more particularly such a colordeveloper sheet characterized in that a coating liquid is used which results from the use of activated clay in solid particulate which has been in advance admixed with sodium silicate and optionally other. dispersants. Carbonless copying paper Ere knon as disclosed for example in U.S. Patents t. 2,712,517, No. 2,800,457 and NO. 2,730,457. Such carbonless copying paper utilizes microcapsules containing 2 solution of an electron donative, non adsorptive, reactive colorless organic compound hereinafter referred to as color former and an electror acceptive, reactive, absorp tive material hereinafter referred to as color developer 1 . Microencapsulation is effected bv means of coacervation, interfacial polymerization, in situ polymerixation and other processes. Color fomers include malachite green lactone, crystal violet lactone, benzoyl leuco methylene blue, rhodamine B lactam, 3 dialkylamino 7 dialkylamylfluoran, 3 methyl 2, spiropi benzo f chromene and the like. Colordevelopersinclude solid acids sucin as acid clay, activated clay, attapulgite, zeolite, bentonite and the like an organic group of phenolic resins such as p tert butylphenol resin, p phenylphenol resin, p octylphencl resin and the like, organic compounds such as succinic acid, tannic zc i, malonic acid, gallic acid and the like, or metal compounds thereof and aromatic carboxylic acids such as benzoic acid, salicylic acid, substituted salicylic acids, naphthoic acid, diphenic acid and the like, o metal compounds thereof. Typical examples in the usual practice are activated clay phenolic resins and substituted salicylic acids.Phenolic resins and substituted salicylic acids are adequate for high concentration sheet coating but give rise to poor ink absorptivity. These o color evelopers have another drawback that due primarily to chemically synthesized substances, they are susceptibie to degradation or decomposition of the printed marks under sunlight which would in turn fade away. inorganic activated clay is superior in ink absorptivity and inexpensive.However, such activated clay color evcroper is disadvantageous in that a coating liquid prepared therefrom is liable to become gelled in high concentrations, with ultimate difficultly in sheet coating, and that sets of paper coated with lowconcentration costing liquids involve blanket smear piling at the time of printing. Activated clay used as the color developer is, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publications No. 41 2373, No. 417622 and No. 42 8811, about 200 m2 g or greater in surface area and prepared by treating acid clay or similar types of clay with a mineral acid to eiute acid soluble alu nina, iron and other basic components. Activated clay, even if mixed with zinc, magnesi n and other salts, may be used successfully. An X ray analysis shows that activated clay is amorphous, re. tively large in surface area and haracteristicall different from ordinary paper coating pigments. When dispersed in water, activated clay requires a greater amount of water to complete the dis persion aue to its shape, surface activity and other factors. Xaoljn clay typical of paper coating remains fluid in concentrations of 70 and above when dispersed in water, whereas activated clay becomes viscous and gelled in concentrations of about 45 . A strong demand now prevails for high concentrajon coating liquids from the point of viett of productivity and energy saving. Activated clay is difficult to process or such high concentration coating liquids for the reasons already stated. An air knife cater process is therefore currently employed using low concentration coating liquids. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a color developer sheet for carbonless copying which is coated with a high concentrations, less viscous, highly fluid coating liquid and which is satisfactory in blanket smear at the time of printing. It has now been found that the use of the above coating liquid makes it ccssible to improve dispersability and fluidity of activated clay in water and lower the viscosity and hence control the amount of the coating to be applied in high concentrations. Coating operation may be facilitated, and energy saving accomplished. The color developer sheet produced shows good surface quality, smoothness and smudge resistance against blurry spots caused by rubbing encapsulated surfaces and free from blanket smear at the time of printing. activated clay used in the present invention may be prepared by treating acid clay with an acid, to be then e.g. washed with water, dried and pulverized. Generally the sodium silicate and other dispersant if any may be mixed with the clay by various methods. For example after the clay is treated with acid and washed with water, the dispersant may be added and mixed into and with it as aqueous solution. Alternatively after the clay is treated with acid and before drying the dispersant is added and mixed in a powder state Alternatively again, after drying, the dispersant is added, mixed and crushed in powder state In another method, after crushing, the dispersant in powdered state is added and mixed, but the invention is not restricted to these methods only. As other dispersants that can be combinedly used with sodium silicate inorganic dispersants such as sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium pyrophosphate and so on and organic dispersants based on carboxylic acids e.g. acrylates , and maleic acid particularly e.g styrene maleic anhydride salt and so on , and sulfonic acid compounds such as naphthalene sulfonate and so on can be used sodium silicate as used in the invention is knosn as a water glass and includes kinds dissolved in water and others in particulate form. Typical examples commercially available are sodium silicate No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3, which are represented by the formula Na2O nSiO2XH2O where n is about 2 for No. 1, about 2.5 for No. 2 and about 3 tor No. 3. Sodium meta silicate is represented by the formula Na2O.SiO2.5H2O or Nz0 SiO2 9H20Any of these e s is effective as a dispersant and more ef ectiv, the greater the mol ratio of Na20. Sodium silicate according to the invention is preferably in amount of 0.5 20 , preferably 1 15 , based on te weight of activated clay. Smaller amounts may demonstrate no effect, while greater amounts m ay hinder color formation. dispersant cc used with sodium silicate is preferably in an amount of 0.1 15 , preferably 1 8 , based on the weight of activated clay. Smaller amounts m a y demonstrate no effect while greater amounts do not adversely affect the viscosity but m a y reduce color forming capabilities. Ptrticularly eligible dispersants used in combination with sodium silicate include sodium p yropnosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate. Activated clay together with the above dispersants is dispersed in water and with known pigments, adhesive compounds and additives formosa coating liquid to be applied onto a substrate such as paper. A particularly suitable pigment is calcium carbonate. As an eligible adhesive, there ray be used polyvinyl alcohol and styrenetbutadiene latexes. Since activated clay particles are amorphous, and porous, they require mare adhesives than do other paper making clays such as kaolin, calcium carbonate and the like in order to obtain a sufficient strength of the coated layer for printing. ow vCr, attempts to use added amounts of synthetic rubber latexes, starch, casein, CY and other water soluble adhesive compounds as commonly used in art papers and coated papers would result in blocked activation of the activated clay and hence in reduced color forming capabilities. Whereas, the sodium silicate according to the invention serves satisfactorily as a dispersant for the amorphous, porous activated clay and as a water soluble inorganic adhesive as well, without hindering color formation unlike conventional synthetic rubber latexes and naturally occurring organic water soluble adhesive compounds. Rather it a c t s to enhance cclor develQDing ability of te activatedEMI6.1 clay. Consesuently, the use of the sodium silicate lead to saving of the adhesive compounds. Oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of alkali or alkali earth metal are known to enhance the ability of activated clay as disclosed for example in Japanese Patent PublicationsNo. 41 2373 and No. 42 8811. However, either addition of activated clay after sodium silicate has been first added to water, or addiction of sodium silicate after activated clay has been first dispersed in water would result in a system which gelled as a whole. A s2tisfactorily fluid, high concentration coating liquid can be obtained according to the invention by using an activated clay in a particulate solid form which has been in advance admixed with sodium silicate and optionally other dispersants. couch coating liquid may be conveniently applied by a blade coater to a substrate to produce a co Dr developer sheet whh has a good surface quality free from smudge on contact with encapsulated surfaces and which is sufficiently strong cnd further free from blanket smear, picking and other troubles which would otherwise occur during printing. These advntages are obtaired particularly with use of a blade coater, but may be retained even with an air knife coater provided that the coating liquid is somewhat reduced in concentration. The invention will be further described by way of the following examples wherein a commercially available MitsubishiNIC Upper Sheet 40 was used as the color former sheet.
