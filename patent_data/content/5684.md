## Abstract
Method for introducing deoxy desulphurizing substances into liquid metal without the use of gaseous carrier. The invention refers to the elimination of sulphur and or oxygen obtained in metal baths and to control the nature and form of the sulphur and oxygen compounds produced as results of deoxy desulphurizing treatment. A further object of the invention is to eliminate the sulphur compounds from slag as volatile compounds in order to avoid the sulphur to be transferred back to the bath from the slag owing to the oxidizing effect of the air. The invention is based on the principle of adding the active substances 3 to the bath through a special hollow carrier 4 wherein they are contained in discrete quantities separated by inert materials 2 . The inert material 2 can be metal sheet, sponge metal or metalpowder and the metal can be iron. The inert material 2 can also take the form of other compounds, e.g. inert oxides, especially alumina. Mixtures of alkali and or alkaline earth halides and oxides of the same elements are particularly useful for the desulphurization of the whole system slag metal by means of sulphur and halide volatile compounds.
