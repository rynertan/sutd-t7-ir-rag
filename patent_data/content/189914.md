# Semiconductor integrated circuit device and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated circuit device wherein the source and drain regions 24 of a MOSFET 12 in an internal circuit have lightly doped structures 26 in order to suppress the appearance of hot carriers, and the source and drain regions 18 of a MOSFET 11 in an input output circuit have structures 20 doped with phosphorus at a high impurity concentration, in order to enhance an electrostatic break down voltage.
