# CLEANING COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING ALPHA OLEFIN MALEIC ANHYDRIDE TERPOLYMERS

## Abstract
This invention relates to the use of alpha olefin maleic anhydride terpolymers in conjunction with anionic surfac tants, such as ammonium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lau ryl ether sulfate, in hair, skin and other cleaning composi tions. The use of alpha olefin maleic anhydride terpolymers in such cleaning compositions reduces the irritation poten tial of anionic surfactants without decreasing the foaming and cleaning characteristics of such compositions.
