# Method of making read write transducer heads and heads so made.

## Abstract
In making a magnetic transducer head with both read and write transducers a problem occurs as the transducers must be accurately aligned but are separated by an insulating layer. A method of making a read write transducer head is dis closed which has separate read 16 and write 18 transducers comprises the steps of depositing a sequence of layers 32R, 34R, 20R, 40R, 38R upon a substrate 10 to form read trans ducer 16 depositing a transparent insulating layer 44 with surface L upon read transducer 16 and lapping the layer flat to surface S depositing a sequence of layers 32W, 34W, 20W, 40W, 38W upon insulating layer 44, S to form write transducer 18 , using optical alignment via transparent layer 44 to align the write transducer 18 relative to the read transducer 16 and finally depositing a protective insulating layer 46,L2 upon the write transducer 18 . The substrate 10 may be formed as a slide with an air bearing surface for flying relative to a rotary magnetic disk.
