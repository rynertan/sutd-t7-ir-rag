# Electrochromic display device and method of operating the same.

## Abstract
An electrochromic display, preferably employing an organic electrochromic material such as heptyl viologen, has display electrodes with a rough surface in contact with the electrochromic material, and is operated at a current density such that the diffusion depth of the material conforms to the contours of the electrodes.
