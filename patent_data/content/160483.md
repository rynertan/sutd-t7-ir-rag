# VASCULAR PROSTHESIS

## Abstract
A vascular prosthesis for implantation in a living mammalian body and a method for producing same are disclosed. The vascular prosthesis has a hydrophobic polymeric layer on its luminal surface defining a substantial ly non thrombogenic flow surface. The polymeric material of the layer defining the flow surface exhibits a rate of platelet consumption of less than about 20 10⁸ platelets cm² day.
