# CROSS COUPLED TRANSISTOR MEMORY CELL FOR MOS RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY OF REDUCED POWER DISSIPATION

## Abstract
A memory cell of the general type employing one pair of IGFETs defining data nodes and cross coupled in a latch circuit configuration for storing data, and another pair of IGFETs serving as transmission gates to selectively couple data into or out of the cell. A circuit technique provides fast writing speed by avoiding the use of load resistors in either the charge or discharge paths for the data nodes and yet ensures that the data nodes are pulled either fully to logic high or fully to logic low, as the case may be, without limitation by threshola voltage offset between the gate and source terminals of the IGFETs serving as transmission gates. High impedance leakage current discharge resis tances are included, and serve only the function of discharg ing leakage at the nodes to maintain memory. In the dis closed circuit configurations, the latch IGFETs are of oppo site channel conductivity type compared to the gating IG FETs. Various alternative forms of suitable high impedance leakage current resistances are disclosed, including a re sistive sea above the cell and leakage paths included within the gating IGFETs. The high impedance leakage current discharge resistances may be eliminated to provide a dy namic memory cell.
