# A magnetic head slider assembly.

## Abstract
Including a slider body 10 having an air bearing surface, rails 12A, 12B, 12C extending from the leading end to the trailing end of the slider body and a thin film transducer 14 . The slider body 10 is formed from a fine grain composition of Al₂O₃ and TiC having average particle size less than 5 microns. The ratio of aluminium oxide to titanium carbide is in the range of 60 80 to 40 20 . The head slider has lower porosity and improved machining and wear characteristics.
