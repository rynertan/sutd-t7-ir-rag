## Description
This invention relates to new compounds capable cf reducing or removing angiotensin dependent hypertension caused by the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II by the angiotensin conversion enzyme in mammals.The renin angiotensin aldosterone system has been recently recognised as one of the factors of primary importance in causing hypertension.The action of the renin enzyme on a blood plasma pseudo globulin produces a decapeptide, namely angiotensin I, which is converted into the octapeptide angiotensin II by the angiotensin conversion enzyme. Angiotensin II exerts a powerful vasoconstricting action which increases the blood pressure.The angiotensin conversion enzyme is also responsible for the inactivation of bradykinin, a nonapeptide of powerful hypotensive action. Thus an inhibiter of said enzyme can exert an antihypertensive action, both by inhibiting the formation of angiotensinII, and by inhibiting the destruction ot bradykinin.Compounds which inhibit the angiotensin conversion enzyme can be used for treating ariotensin dependent hypertension such as renal hypertension and maiignant hypertension. Compounds and methods have already been proposed for treating angiotensin dependerst hypertension. Reference should be made for example to USA patents Nos. 4,046,889 and 4,052,511, German patent application No. 2,752,719, Dutch patent application No. 78 098806, and European patent application No. 0,012,401, which relate to the use of amino acid derivatives in inhibiting the angiotensin conversion enzyme. The inhibiting power of the compounds described in the cited patents and of the other products reported in the known art is often very high.However, the only product at an advanced and documented stage in clinical trials on human beings for the purpose of its final use in therapy has in some cases shown toxic secondary effects see for example Brit.

Med.298, 991 1978 .We have now discovered a particular class of N glutaryl and N goarboxymethylamino acety 2 derivatives of cyclic amino acids which are capable of reducing or removing hypertension caused by the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II by the angiotensin conversion enzyme in mammals.This class of derivatives constitutes the subject matter of the present invention.
