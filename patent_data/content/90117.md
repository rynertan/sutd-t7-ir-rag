## Description
Organic Nitrogen Compounds THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to novel organic nitrogen compounds, their preparation and uses. In particular, the invention relates to novel quaternary ammonium salts and their uses. Quaternary ammonium compounds are well known and the patent and technical literature contains many references to the preparation and uses of many such compounds. Among the more common uses for some quaternary ammonium compounds is the conditioning of textile fabrics of one sort or another. Fabric conditioning is usually achieved by one of the following techniques viz the use of a combined detergent conditioner in the wash cycle addition of the fabric conditioner to the fabric in the hot air drier or addition of the fabric conditioner to the fabric in the cold water rinse at the end of the wash cycle. Commercial fabric conditioner formulations used in the cold water rinse are normally based on a difatty dimethyl quaternary ammonium salt, for example dihydrogenated tallow dimethyl quaternary ammonium chloride DEDflQC , distearyl dimethyl quaternary ammonium chloride etc. Although these formulations convey a satisfactory soft feel to treated fabric there are a number of disadvantages associated with the DUDMQC type of fabric conditioner active component. DEDMQC is normally sold at a 75 active level in a mixed solvent system. It is a paste at normal ambient temperatures and therefore requires heated storage.Manufacturers of fabric conditioner formulations also experience difficulty in preparing storage stable aqueous dispersions of DTDMQC. Although the difficulty can be overcome at low active levels, for example 6 w w, using a combination of high shear mixing and electrolytes both the water and DTDMQC have to be warmed to temperatures in excess of 500C before mixing. Formulations containing DTDMQC active levels above 10 w w tend to be very viscous. Repeated use of fabric conditioner formulations based on DqDMQC also leads to a build up in the hydrophobic nature of treated fabric. This hydrophobicity gives the fabric a greasy feel and interferes with the absorption of moisture. The latter effect is a significant disadvantage for towels, babies nappies etc. Difatty dimethyl quaternary ammonium salts such as DTDMQC also find use in the clarification of cane sugar liquor and in ion exchanging bentonite clays to form bentone gellants. The fact that these salts are pastes with poor water dispersibility is a disadvantage in both of these applications. There is a need, therefore, for a quaternary ammonium salt which possesses one or more of the following characteristics, viz., it is liquid at normal ambient temperatures, is dispersible in cold water say at less than 300C , is suitable for fabric conditioning without producing a build up in the hydrophobic nature of the treated fabric, is easier to formulate at active levels above 10 w w than compounds such as DTDMQC, and is suitable for other uses. Qauternary ammonium salts according to the invention are defined by the formulaEMI2.1 where R1 comprises a long chain alkyl group containing from 8 to 24, preferably 12 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 13 to 17 carbon atoms R2 comprises an alkyl group containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and is more preferably methyl R3 comprises a lower alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or comprises hydroxyalkgl for example hydroxyethyl 50 represents an alkylene oxide or mixed alkylene oxides, for example ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide O n 30 and X is an anion. In preferred embodiments of this invention, the substituentR1 comprises a long chain alkyl group or mixtures thereof containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms, the groups being both straight chain and branched, the amount of branching being in the range 30 to 70 . In more preferred embodiments of this invention the substituent R1 represents a mixture of long chain alkyl groups containing 13 or 15 carbon atoms comprising approximately 65 to 75 C13 groups with approximately 35 to 25 C15 groups the percentages being calculated on the total of long chain alkyl groups with approximately 40 to 55 w w straight chain to 60 to 45 w w 2 alkyl branched chain where the 2 alkyl group is predominantly methyl. Preferred quaternary ammonium salts according to this invention include those for formula I in which in the substituent AO n the value of n is in the range 1 to 8. Such preferred salts include those where A0 represents both one and more than one alkylene oxide and where such mixed alkylene oxide groups are present, their total number is in the range 1 to 8. For example, theApplicants have found that in compounds containing a mixture of ethylene oxide EO and propylene oxide PO groups, those having a greater proportion of PO groups, for example in a ratio of 6Po to 2EO groups, are preferred for uses such as sugar clarification and fabric softening. Quaternary ammonium salts according to this invention can be prepared by several methods, for example by alkoxylation of a tertiary amine salt R1 R2 R3 i6 X , and preferably by alkoxylation of a secondary amine R1 R2 NE followed by quaternisation of the resulting tertiary amine with the quaternisation agent R3X whereR1, R2 R3 and X are as defined hereinbefore. A particularly preferred secondary amine is a mixture of amines known as Synprolam 35M Registered Trade Mark where R is a mixture of C13 and C 1 13 15 alkyl groups and R2 is methyl. Preferred embodiments of the quaternary ammonium salts according to this invention are liquid at normal ambient temperatures, are dispersible in cold water, can be readily formulated into compositions, for example fabric conditioning compositions, at active levels above 10 w w. quaternary ammonium compounds according to this invention may be used with or without a solvent, for example isopropanol water.They are suitable for use in fabric conditioning, in the clarification of cane sugar liquor and in ion exchanging bentonite clays to form bentone gellants. The invention is further illustrated by the followingExamples. EXAMPLE 1 A mixture of C1yC15 amines, known as Synprolam 35M 1 mole and potassium hydroxide 0.5 w w on amine was charged to an alkoxylation vessel, purged with nitrogen and the vessel evacuated. The mixture of C13 C15 amines contained approximately 70 C13 and approximately 30 C15 amines with 96 of secondary amines with theR2 substituent as shown in formula I, being predominantly methyl and 3 primary and tertiary amines. Residual water was removed under reduced pressure at 11000 and the temperature raised to 1400C.Ethylene oxide 5 mole was added over several hours maintaining a maximum reaction pressure of 50 psig. The temperature was maintained at 140 C for a further hour and the reaction product, designatedSynprolam 35MX5, then allowed to cool to 259C. The product was 98 amine ethoxylate with an average ethoxyl content of 5 mole and 2 non amine material. The product was of formula R1 R2N A0 nE, whereR1 was C13 Cr5, R2 was methyl, A0 was ethylene oxide and n was, on average, 5. EtEMPLE 2 Synprolam 35MX5 9Og, 0.2 mole prepared as in Example 1, methyl chloride 10.09g, 0.2 mole and isopropanol 12g were warmed at 10500 for 4 hours. The resulting liquid product, designated Synprolam 35MX5QC, was purged with nitrogen and analysed as 85 w w of the corresponding quaternary ammonium salt in which, referring to formulaI, R3 was methyl and 4 w w amine plus amine salt. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give Synprolam 35 MK5QC 100 active which was a liquid at normal ambient temperature. EXAMP E 3 A series of quaternary ammonium chlorides were prepared following the procedures outlined in Examples 1 and 2. A quaternary ammonium sulphate was also prepared for comparison.

EXAMPLE 4 Each of the quaternary ammonium salts listed in Table 2 was dispersed in water to give a total active level of 6 w w and assessed for fabric softening using the following test method.TEST METHOD The fabric cotton towelling to be treated is first desired by a 5 minute wash at 50 C using Drive soap powder 4g powder per 3 litres of wash water and 30 litres wash water per Kg of fabric .The fabric is then given 4 cold water rinses lasting 1 minutes each and spin dried for 3 minutes. The fabric is finally dried in a tumbler drier for 90 minutes. The fabric is treated using 20g of the quaternary ammonium salt dispersion 6 w w active level per 30 litres of water and stirring for 5 minutes 25 C. The fabric is then dried in the spin drier for 3 minutes and finally in the tumbler drier as described above. Each piece of fabric is compared to untreated fabric viz fabric subjected to the above test method without the quaternary ammonium salt being present in the cold water rinse using the standard paired comparison test method. All of the quaternary ammonium salte studied imparted a soft feel to the treated fabric.EXAMPLE 5 Each of the quaternary ammonium salts listed in Table 2 was assessed for rewettability . Rewettability is a measure of the hydrophobic nature of treated fabric and is determined using the following test method.TEST METHOD For each quaternary ammonium salt, a piece of fabric cotton towelling, 2 by 1 i.e. approximately 61cm x 30.5 cm is desized and treated according to the procedure described in Example 4. The procedure is repeated twice more. Three strips 25cm by 4cm are cut from the treated fabric and weighted at the bottom with 5cm lengths of glass rod. The bottom 3cm of the fabric are then immersed in a 0.18 w v aqueous solution of Lissamine Red 2G Registered TradeMark . The height travelled by the dye solution in 30 mutes is recorded and the mean taken for the three strips.This mean is then compared to that obtained for untreated fabric viz. fabric subjected to the above test method without the quaternary ammonium salt being present in the cold water rinse .
