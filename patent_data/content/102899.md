# Method for making a solid flotation cable.

## Abstract
To produce a solid, incompressible floatation cable, a cable core is continuously jacketed with a resin foam. The foam is a rapidly curing, microballoon containing resin which is molded in a moving, endless double belt mold. The foam parameters such as specific gravity, viscosity, and cure rate are predetermined and the foam temperature during mixing and curing is controlled to produce stable and uniform results.

## Description
NSTHOD FOR MAKING A SOLID FLOATATION CABLE Background of the Invention In marine seismic exploration, seismic data is often acquired offshore by towing a specialized cable behind a ship.The cable may contain many arrays containing up to 30 hydrophones connected together. Each array is connected to a shipboard recording system. The total cable length is variable, but two miles is typical. A seismic source, usually compressed air injection near the ship, creates the acoustic signal. The reflection of that signal from subsurface strata is detected by the hydrophones.For deep water operations, the cable is typically moved or pulled continuously through the water, for example at 4 t9 7 knots. Taking advantage of this movement, the depth of the cable is controlled, usually to a depth of 20 40 feet, by the action of devices known as birds . The birds have adjustable winged surfaces, and the attitudes of the wing surfaces are controlled to maintain the desired depth. The birds are usually mounted on the cable at approximately 600 foot intervals. For shallow water, a bottom reference configuration is used, the cable being dragged along the bottom in a so called drag cable operation. In such shallow water bottom reference operations, chains are usually attached every 100 feet to the normally buoyant cable. As each chain settles onto the bottom, weight is released until a condition of neutral buoyancy occurs, positioning the cable several feet above the sea bottom. A cable weighted by chains can be dragged at approximately 2 knots.However, a more popular method for bottom reference operations with a weighted cable is the yo yo . Here the cable is periodically reeled in quickly and then unspooled slowly while the ship continues moving forwardly at a steady 2 knots. Data is recorded during the unspooling phase. Finally, another common type of operation is the stationary cable mode in which the cable is staked to the sea bottom. This operation, more often carried out with smaller ships, is time consuming. To make such cables essentially neutrally buoyant, commonly employed cables consist of a kerosene filled hose enclosing hydrophones, electrical wires, plastic spacers and steel ropes. The kerosene provides buoyancy the plastic spacers and steel ropes furnish structural support and tensile strength. A hydrophone is mounted between the spacers, usually at approximately 3 foot intervals. Electrical wire bundles then pass through holes in the spacers and connect to the hydrophones. Covering this structure is a thin walled plastic hose having an outside diameter, typically, of two to three inches. The hose is filled with electrical grade kerosene or another oil of similar density to provide the desired buoyancy. Buoyancy trilzming is then often accomplished by strapping lead weights to the outside of the cable. Such prior art cables have several distinct disadvantages. For example, with increasingly longer cable con figurations, and more complex hydrophone electrical connections in these cables, more wire pairs and stronger strength members must be used. This results in increased weight which must be compensated by an increase in the oil volume, to maintain a condition near neutral buoyancy. This results in cables which become larger and larger i.e., increasingly larger diameters , and such cables are more difficult to handle and to store. Another major disadvantage of prior art liquid filled cables is the substantial cable maintainance required. Jacket cuts occur, often because of improper handling or collisions with other ships, subsea structures, or debris. Kerosene leakage causes buoyancy loss and the need for inmediate replacement.Salt water intrusion causes electrical shorts. Replacement rates for drag cables are particularly high. In some areas, exploration surveys have had to be terminated because of excessive damage to bottom reference cables. The kerosene filled cable also requires intermittent buoyancy adjustment due to such factors as small leaks or salinity and temperature changes. Such adjustments are often difficult to perform accurately aboard a ship. Also, a kerosene filled cable poses a distinct fire hazard. A need thus remains for an effective, versatile, and reliable method for manufacturing a floatation cable having stable floatation characteristics, durability in bottom reference operations, and which is free of the numerous disadvantages of the liquid oil filled floatation cables used heretofore. Summary of the Invention It is therefore a general object of the present invention to provide a new and improved method for the preparation of a solid floatation cable. This and other objects are attained, in accordance with one aspect of the invention by a method for continuously molding a solid floatation cable, comprising a pulling a cable core through, and in synchronism with, a moving mold, b surrounding the cable with a curable foam for filling the space within the mold, c curing the foam within the mold around the cable core as the cable core, mold, and foam move together, and d releasing the newly formed floatation cable from the mold after the foam has cured. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.

Descriotion of the Preferred Embodiment With reference to the drawings, the foam its usually received and stored as a premixed resin for example,XJT l 26A, Fluid Polymer Systems, El Cajon, California containing glass microballoons such as FTD 202, Emerson Cuming, Inc . Near the molding apparatus 10 is a rotator 14 on which 5S gallon drums or barrels 16 of the premixed foam are stored prior to use in the apparatus 10. The rotator 14 receives the drums on their sides and rotates them continuously to assure that the microballoons, which tend to float, are uniformly dispersed in the resin. When the cable is prepared, a barrel 16 of foam is placed on a transfer device 18. A suitable such device is available from Pyles Industries Inc., Wixom, Michigan, 48096. This transfer device pressurizes the foam and pushes it through a feed hose 19 to a positive displacement vane pump 20. If more than 55 gallons of foam is required, additional drums or barrels such as barrel 22 can be connected to barrel 16 to replenish or refill it, as by transferring the foam from barrel 22 under high pressure e.g., 500 psi in a Pyles replenisher. Vane pump 20 is driven by a variable speed pump motor 23 to provide an adjustable, constant volume output typically at pressures up to 400 psi while minimizing attrition of the glass microballoons in the foam. Pump 20 pumps the foam through a continuous mixer or mixing tube 25 which is wrapped with cooling coils 26. The cooling coils, connected to a chilling unit 28, are for initially retarding the curing of the foam the curative having been added at that point , until the foam is in position within the mold portion of apparatus 10. During initial setup, no curative is added. Instead, a foam sample is drawn from the mixing tube 25 for measurement of its specific gravity. Fram this the volumetric concentration or percentage of resin within the foam is calculated so that the proper ratio of a suitable accelerator, and of the curative, can be determined. The ratio of accelerator and of curative to foam is then set in a ratio control 30 to which both the vane pump motor 23 and two metering pump motors 32 and 33 are slaved. Metering pump motors 32 and 33, in turn, drive respective accelerator metering and curative metering pumps 34 and 35 which, when apparatus 10 is in full operation, deliver the accelerator and curative from respective accelerator and curing agent containers 36 and 37 through respective feed lines 38 and 39 into the inline, continuous mixing tube 25 for mixing and chilling with the foam therein. A suitable curative or curing agent is XJT 1 26B FluidPolymer Systems and the accelerator used therewith is dibutyl tin dioctoate T 8 M T.Prior to placing the system in opera tion, however, it is desirable to measure the actual cure curve of the foam to assure the stability of the cure rate. This may be conveniently done, for example, using a Brabender t P asti Corder S. W. Brabender Instruments, Inc., South Hackensack, New Jersey . Next the pumps 20, 34 and 35 are started. As normally desired, the curing agent feed line 39 and accelerator feed line 38 may first be disconnected from mixing tube 25 permitting the foam, accelerator, and curing agent to be separately collected for a final, preliminary test e.g. via hand mixing . Then the apparatus 10 is placed in full operation by connecting the curative and accelerator feedlines 38 and 39 to mixing tube 25.The pumps are operated for a short period to purge any previous materials e.g., unaccelerated foam from the mixing tube 25 and then the mixing tube is connected to the foam injection area 40 of apparatus 10. The foam injection area 40 is at the beginning of the molding line, generally referred to by reference numeral 45. On either side of the foam injection area 40 is a pair of opposed belts 47 which are driven to conduct and guide the foam into a pair of facing, complimentary, endless belt molds 50a and b as they are closing at area 40. Belts 47 prevent dead spots from forming in the foam in the injection area. A reel i2 of cable core 53 is supported in a payoff 54 near the foam injection area 40 at the closing area or region 40 where the endless belt molds come together during operation of the molding line 45. Reel 52 and payoff 54 are aligned with the molding line 45, and at startup, a lead line not shown of a diameter smaller than the cable core 53 is passed through the closed portion of the flexible belt molds 50 and onto the takeup reel 58 mounted on the takeup j9. The lead line 56 is small so that the belt molds 50a and b can be driven without pulling the cable core 53. The endless belt molds 50a and b are propelled by a caterpuller 62 which rotates the belt molds as illustrated. The belt molds thus move together at the foam injection area 40 and travel together, under the guidance and pressure of alternating horizontal and vertical rollers 66 in the molding line 45, to a separation area 65. The rollers 66 maintain the critical dimensions of the cable while in line 45. At the separation area 65, the belts are peeled away from each other and from the cable. The endless belts then return to the closing or foam injection area 40 through heated guide assemblies 67 which preheat the belt molds 50a and b. The heat is supplied from a warm air heater 68 which feeds warmed air into the guide assemblies 67. The preheating of the endless belt molds 50a and b prior to reaching the closing area 40 is designed to promote or accelerate the curing of the. foam after the foam is in place in the mold and formed onto the cable core. The belt molds 50a and b are preferably formed of a flexible release material. The flexible material at the foamengaging surface 60 preferably has a low surface bonding energy to facilitate release from the foam, which is itself an aggressive bonding material which possesses residual tackiness even after curing. Such tackiness discourages the use of rigid molds since, even with release coatings, substantial force is needed to sepa ate the mold from the foam in a single movement, and this could damage the foam. With 2 flexible mold, the mold can be opened progressively, thereby minimizing the opening force required at any given moment. Two of the elastomers which are preferred for the mold releasing material are silicone and ethylene propylene rubber EPR . Silicone is available as a room temperature curable liquid material, making it particularly attractive for fabricating large articles in light duty molds. Its physical properties and its expense, however, are less than ideal. In the preferred embodiment, therefore, the foam engaging surface 60 see Fig. 6 was molded of silicone, but the balance or backing 61 of the belts 50a and b was made of polyurethane, the two materials 60 and 61 being attached mechanically through an interface 63 of velour cloth. These mold belts 50a and b were additionally strengthened and stabilized by gluing a reinforcing belt 64 to the back surface of this backing material 61. At the separation area 65 is a pair of turnaround sheaves 10 which, when molding line 45 is in operation, peel the belts away from the now cured foamed cable 75 Fig. 5 . Downstream from separation area 65 is a flash trimmer 77 which removes any flash found at the mold parting line. The cable then passes over a tape supply not shown to a tape wrapper 79 which wraps a tape 81 longitudinally along cable 75 to protect the cable surface from contamination before further jacketing. In operation, the specific gravity, viscosity, and cure rate of the foam are first determined prior to molding the floatation cable. Preferably, these are closely controlled and kept stable and uniform throughout each batch for each particular cable being manufactured. The cure rate is set, as by running cure curves on a Brabender tester, using samples with various levels of accelerator. The accelerator level is then set for the batch. The viscosity of the resin plus microballoons is also measured, as with a Brookfield EBT viscometer. Just prior to manufacturing the cable, the foam resin is placed in the Pyles transfer device. The foam is then delivered by positive displacement vane pump 20 to provide an adjustable, constant output at a pressure which may be as high as 400 psi but with minimum attrition of the microballoons. The foam is then pumped through the chilled mixing tube 25, and after the proper ratio of accelerator and curative is determined, the curative solvent selector valve 93 is set to deliver curative or curing agent from the curing agent container 37 through the metering pump 35. Due to the rapid curing of the foam, it is advantageous to assure proper metering before finally placing the molding line 45 in operation. Therefore, these liquids foam resin, accelerator, and curative are first tested, as by collecting them for identical periods of time and then hand mixing.The accelerator feed line 38 and the curative feed line 39 are then attached to the mixing tube 25 and the pumping system is turned on to purge unaccelerated foam from the mixing tube 25. At that time the mixing tube is positioned to feed the foam into the foam injection area 40. The caterpul ler 62 was previously turned on to rotate the belt molds 50a and b through the guide assemblies 67 to preheat the molds. when the accelerated foam is then injected into the foam injection area 40 where the molds are closing , the takeup reel 58 is rotated by takeup 59 to pull the cable core 53 forward and into the belt molds 50a and b. These then pull the cable forward synchronously with the movement of the belt molds SOa and b. As the cable core is pulled in synchronism with the moving molds 50a and b, it may be centered, for example, by the hydrophone mounts 96 in the illustrated embodiment, which are typically positioned at three foot intervals and may have substantially the same outer diameter as the foam molding. The movement of the endless belt molds 50a and b and the rates of operation of pumps 20, 34, and 35 are controlled so that a slight excess of foam is first introduced into the foam injection area 40. Then the rates are matched so that the excess does not increase or decrease but is steadily replenished. The length of the molding line 45, in which the belt molds 50a and b remain closed, is about 35 feet. The belt mold portions 50a and b, of course, are propelled in unison with each other, for example at the rate of about 2 feet per minute. The curing rate of the foam, as previously described, has already been carefully determined to assure that it is sufficiently cured before the cable 75 reaches the turnaround sheaves 70. At the exit of the caterpuller 62 the molds 50a and b reverse direction around turnaround sheaves 70, peeling the belt molds away from the cured cable 75 and returning to the foam injection area 40 through the heated guide assemblies 67. The cable is then trimned of flash in the flash trimmer 77, wrapped in wrapper 79, and wound onto takeup reel 58. When the tail end of the cable passes into the molding line 45, the selector valve 93 is positioned to provide solvent from solvent container 98 and to discontinue the supply of the curing agent. The mixing tube 25 is moved away from the foam injection area 40, and the remaining accelerated foam therein is purged. As may be seen, therefore, the present invention provides numerous advantages. Principal among these is the ability to fabricate a solid floatation cable on a continuous basis. A cable of virtually any length may therefore be made without the necessity for laboriously fabricating and attaching individual sect ions of foam material. The method is therefore versatile, practical, effective, and suited for use in the widest range of applications. WhIle the method herein described constitutes a preferred embodiment of this invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to this precise method, and that changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.
