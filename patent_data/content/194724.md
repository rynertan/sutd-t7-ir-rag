# Colour display tube.

## Abstract
A colour display tube comprising in an evacuated enve lope 1 an electron gun system 5 for generating three electron beams 12, 13, 14 which are situated with their axes in one plane and which in the operating tube are deflected over a display screen 9 in two mutually perpendicular directions 22, 23 , which plane extends in a first direction of deflection, said display screen com prising patterns of areas luminescing in different colours, there being in front of the display screen a colour selection electrode 10 which comprises rows of substantially rectangular apertures extending substantially parallel to the second direction of de flection, said apertures being at a substantially equal pitch in the direction of the rows and at a substantially equal pitch in the direction perpendicular thereto, the apertures of juxtaposed rows being staggered with respect to each other. If in such a tube the ridges between the apertures are situated substantially on substantially straight lines in the plane of the colour selection electrode, which lines enclose an angle be tween 3 and 8 with the first direction of deflection, the oc currence of moiré patterns is very effectively suppressed.

## Description
The invention relates to a colour display tube com prising in an evacuated envelope an electron gun system for gene rating three electron beams which are situated with their axes in one plane and which in the operating tube are deflected over a display screen in two mutually perpendicular directions, which plane extends in a first direction of deflection, said display screen comprising patterns of areas luminescing in different colours, there being provided in front of the said display screen a colour selection electrode which comprises rows of substantially rectangular apertures, the rows extending substantially parallel to the second direction of deflection and the apertures in each row being separated from each other by ridges, said apertures having a substantially equal pitch in the direction of the rows, and the apertures of juxtaposed rows being staggered with respect to each other. Such a colour display tube is known from United States Patent Specification 3,973,159 PHN.6759 . This Specification dis closes a colour display tube having a colour selection electrode, sometimes termed shadow mask, comprising parallel rows of aper tures. These rows of apertures are staggered in known manner in It has moreover been found that for a colour display tube which is destined for use in one special transmission system and in which a given number of scanning lines per picture and con sequently a given line spacing occurs, the mutual space between the apertures in the colour selection electrode should be chosen in a specific manner in relation to the line spacing so as to mini mize moiré effects, if any. However, in these optimum conditions, too, moiré effects which are still visible may occur with a small dimension of the spot of the electron beam on the display screen in the second direction of deflection. In colour display tubes of the in line type, this is the case especially on the left hand and on the right hand sides of the display screen. The possibility that moiré effects are still observed exists also if deviations occur as a result of the non linearity of the picture time base. Furthermore, the choice of the space between the apertures is re stricted because different line spacings have to be taken into account if the display tube is to be suitable for different trans mission systems. In order to mitigate these disadvantages, United States Patent Specification 3,486,061 PHN.2148 suggests making the smallest angle between the first direction of deflection and the rows of apertures in the colour selection electrode between 5 and 10 . The occurrence of visible moiré patterns is then strongly re duced. In the colour display tube described in the said Patent Specification, three electron beams are generated which are situated with respect to each other such that in the electron gun system the cross sections of the axes of the beams with a plane perpendicular to the tube axis constitute the corners of an equilateral triangle. There is a so called delta gun arrangement. One side of the said triangle is substantially parallel to the scanning lines. It is of importance that the relationship between the location of the electron beams and the rows of, in this case circular, apertures in the colour selection electrode is maintained. Since according to the United States Patent Specification 3,486,068 the smallest angle between the direction at right angles to the scanning lines and the rows of apertures in the colour selection electrode is between 5 and 10 , this should hence also apply to the smallest angle between the direction of the scanning lines on the display screen and the side at the triangle formed by the electron beams in the electron gun system. This can be achieved by rotating, during the assembly of the colour display tube, the electron gun system about its axis over the relevant angle between 5 and 10 with respect to the usual assembly position. The rotation of the electron gun system in a colour display tube of the in line type, in which three electron beams are generated which are situated with their axes in one, usually horizontal, plane, is not attractive since this will present problems in the convergence. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an in line colour display tube of the kind described in the opening paragraph in which the occurrence of moiré patterns is effectively suppressed and in which it is not necessary to rotate the electron gun system. According to the invention, a colour display tube of the kind mentioned in the opening paragraph is characterized in that the ridges between the apertures are positioned substantially on substantially straight lines which enclose an angel between 3 and 8 with the first direction of deflection. The normal orientation of the in line electron gun system can be maintained , as well as the usual orientation of the pattern of luminescent areas. The only variation is a shift of the ridges so that they are positioned substantially on substantially straight lines which enclose an angle between 3 and 8 with the first direction of deflection, as will be explained in detail hereinafter. A preferred embodiment of a colour display tube accord ing to the invention is characterized in that the apertures are staggered with respect to each other in such a manner that alter nately a ridge and the centre of an aperture are situated sub stantially on the said substantially straight line. Experiments have demonstrated that in that case the moiré effects can be drastically reduced. An embodiment of the invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the ac companying drawing, in which Referring to Fig. 1, the tube comprises a glass enve lope 1 consisting of a display window 2, a cone 3, and a neck 4. An electron gun system 5 consisting of three electron guns 6, 7 and 8 situated with their axes in one plane is provided in the neck 4. A display screen 9 is provided on the inside of the display window 2. This screen comprises a large number of triplets of phosphor lines or rows of discrete elongate dots luminescing blue, green and red. At a short distance in front of the display screen 9 a colour selection electrode 10 is present which consists of a metal plate in which a large number of rows of substantially rectangular apertures 11 are provided. The apertures in Fig. 1 are diagrammatic only and are not drawn to scale. The three electron beams 12, 13 and 14 converge on the display screen 9 after having passed through the apertures 11 in the colour selection electrode. Because the electron beams make a small angle with each other, the so called colour slection angle, they each impinge only on phosphor regions of one colour. Fig. 2 shows a part of the colour selection electrode 10. The apertures are arranged in rows a few of which are denoted by 15, 16, 17 and 18. The longitudinal direction of these rows is parallel to the second direction of deflection 23 and to the longitudinal direction of the phosphor lines of the display screen 9 and in normal use of the tube it is vertical. The apertures 11 in the various rows are staggered with respect to each other. The length The invention is not restricted to the type of colour selection electrode described. Electrodes can also be manufactured in which more staggering takes place between the rows or in which the centres of the apertures are not situated on the said straight lines. The gist of the invention is that the ridges are situated on substantially straight lines which enclose an angle α between 3 and 8 with the first horizontal direction of deflection.
