## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PROCESSING AND PACKAGING DIGITAL DATATECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to the field of computer technology and of digital systems, including communications, involving data processing, storage and or transmission. More particularly, the invention concerns a method and means for processing and packing digital data and provides, inter alia, a new form of memory for mass storage of digital data. The term digital data is herein used to denote any electrical signal in multi bit digital form expressing a number generally representative of information. The invention also concerns electrical signal processing circuitry arrangements.BACKGROUND ART Various forms of devices and systems for the collection or mass storage of digital data are widely used in the field of digital data processing and computer technology, ranging from magnetic recording media systems to solid state semi conductor devices and systems, providing read write facilities and random access. There is, however, a continual search and need for improvements in such known devices and systems, especially when implemented as digital data memories, particularly in respect of storage capacity, low production costs and small physical dimensions, reliability and physical stability, ease and speed of operation, etc. Disclosure of Invention The present invention introduces new concepts into the field of data packaging and storage and is adapted to provide most exceptional degrees of compression of data. Digital data is converted into analogue form to permit of compression in the time domain but as will be seen from the subsequent description of one embodiment a remarkable degree of precision and control is maintained under dynamic conditions and programmed control, and the invention includes many new features, innovative ideas and circuitry.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTPreliminary Outline The memory module 8 as illustrated in FIGURE 1 of the drawings is made up of a main control and driver processing unit assembly 10 and a plurality of dynamic storage unit sub assemblies 12, herein termed nodes , which together with an internal power supply unit and reference voltage source 15 may all be compactly contained in a housing structure of small physical dimensions for example, 220 x 220 x 180mm . The memory 8 in this embodiment is designed for use as a peripheral unit interfaced with a host computer to provide a nonvolatile high density bulk buffer storage system for digital data in the form of 8 bit bytes. The processing operations and dynamic functioning of the memory module are under the overall supervisory control of a micro controller 14 abbreviated MICTR which includes a selected microprocessor such as, for example, that currently available under the reference MC 68000 L Motorola , together with associated RAM and ROM storage. The MICTR is also linked to a matrix array of non volatile latch registers providing a 256 x 32 bit digital parameter store 62 which represents an ultimate storage domain of the device as will hereinafter be apparent. Other principal functional processing elements of the memory module, incorporated in the main control and driver processing unit assembly 10, include a digital data input output process stage 18, a data converter 20 having both digital to analogue D A converter and analogue to digital A D converter stages under the control of the MICTR, and a digital base address counter 24 which gives an output in expanded scientific mode and has an overall count up 7 range of at least 0 to 999 x 10 The digital data is input to, and output from, the memory module by way of a conventional bi directional tri state buffered external data bus 16 of the host computer. During input, the data bytes are passed sequentially, generally as a block from the host computer and organised as a file identified by a specific coded file name , to the digital data I O process stage 18 via an I O control gate. The incoming bytes can be temporarily stored in the ordered form of a queue and the bit voltage levels can be adjusted before being passed, under the control of a direct memory addressing DMA controller, to a data source buffer register in the RAM within the MICTR.Subsequently, however, each byte in sequence is processed individually in a particular time period in synchronism with the clock controlled machine cycle of the system until all the file input is dealt with and stored. In interfacing with the host computer, the memory module is addressed via a host address bus 17 and at least 32 bytes will be mapped within the host computer for carrying out the addressing function. This is indicated in FIGURE 2 which is a diagram showing the memory module 8 and the relevant section of a map of part of the host RAM in a typical interfacing arrangement. In this diagram of FIGURE 2, a grouping of the functional blocks in the memory module is shown which is slightly different from that in the main block diagram of FIGURE 1, but it will be understood that these diagrams are only schematic to illustrate the functional processes and can be arranged in different ways for convenience they do not necessarily relate to the actual physical layout of the functional components and circuitry or a complete and invariable signal routing plan. Similarly, in FIGURE 3 which is a further diagram illustrating the internal organisation of the module including the bus systems in relation to the microprocessor and main RAM store of the MICTR, the Base Address Counter 24, digital data I O gate of the data I O process stage 18, the D A and A D converter stages and other functional parts.It will be appreciated that in accordance with conventional microprocessor and computer technology, the internal busses may each form continuous highways carrying a variety of signals for the different stages linked therewith, the signals being routed appropriately by the control logic of the system. In this case, it may be noted that the external data bus 16 connecting with the host enters the internal data bus 19 through the I O gate, and the external host address bus 17 may also be connected in to the internal address bus 21 through a suitable protective gating arrangement 25. The method of storage of data within the memory module can be selectable and after selection will be under the control of the host computer CPU possible filing and search techniques include sequential, block, binary and indexed sequential. As will hereinafter become more clearly apparent, in use a write operation involves transforming the digital data bytes with high precision into corresponding voltage analogue data signals which are dynamically compressed, mapping the data digitally and in analogue form onto a base reference derived from the base address counter whereby each data unit or byte is in effect allocated a unique numerical identification address corresponding to a unique location in the memory system, applying the mapped data including a time dependent element to a node , and storing parameters which define the accumulated mapped data and permit of extraction and reconstitution of the digital data in subsequent read operations. Thus, returning now to Figure 1, each data byte for storage is passed from the MICTR 14 in practice from the internal data bus 19 accessing to the data buffer register s and digital data I O process stage of which part can be regarded as formed by the bus portion 19a indicated in Figure 1 to the data converter 20 hereinafter described in more detail , and the voltage analogue output therefrom is then dynamically compressed by the logarithmic amplifier 22 which in effect applies a non linear sca ing to the signal before subsequent mapping. The mapping of the compressed voltage analogue data signals is achieved by modulating them in an analogue summing amplifier 32 of a mapping stage 34 onto voltage analogue base reference signals, obtained from the digital output of the base address counter 24 as hereinafter described, to produce unique mapped data voltage analogue signals which, after possible further dynamic compression in an optional intermediate logarithmic amplifier 42, are further scaled if necessary in an output operational amplifier 44, herein termed an absolute value amplifier, of the mapping stage 34. Finally, the unique composite mapped data voltage analogue output from the mapping stage 34 is applied through a selectiveMICTR controlled switching unit 46 to a respective node 12 wherein the mapped data is effectively deposited and stored, in the form of precisely equivalent unique valued quantities of electrical charge, in an isolated dynamic pseud variable precision capacitive element thereof. Each node 12 can stack and store several levels of charge corresponding to the successive composite mapped data voltage analogue signals received, representing successive bytes of data, each new additional value being summed with the previous accumulated value to build up what may be termed a charged packet . As will also be further explained later, in each node 12 the capacitive element is grounded to an adjustable base level potential and in effect has a variable capacitance controlled by the MICTR in accordance with the operative mapping range of theBase Address Counter. Overall, the capacitive element of each node 12 behaves somewhat in the manner of a variable capacitor where it is possible to vary precisely both the capacitive value and the dynamic charge store range by varying the base level potential or base threshold reference , under the digital control of the MICTR and associated control stages. During deposition of data each node operates in an integrator circuit mode. As each byte of mapped data is deposited information pertaining thereto is transmitted to the MICTR and is recorded digitly in the latch registers of the parameter store 62.After each batch or file of data input the accumulated charge level is then maintained by continually refreshing in refresh cycles , again controlled by the MICTR, in a manner analogous to that used for dynamic RAM devices. Thus it will be appreciated that the memory is dynamically operative and at any instant the contents of the registers of the parameter store 62 will reflect in coded form the current charge level and pattern on the nodes 12 which, in turn, represents a package of all the mapped and compressed original data input up to that instant. As indicated the latter can then be reconstituted as required in subsequent read operations, basically by extracting the relevant charge values from the nodes in response to input of relevant read and address signals and carrying out a reverse series of processing operations, under the programmed control of the MICTR. Upon switching off the unit the overall parameters of the previously stored data, in terms of the node charge levels and patterns, base address values and the last data value entered, remain stored in the non volatile latch registers of the parameter store 62, so that when the unit is next switched on this enables the nodes to be replenished to their previous levels in a similar manner to that during refresh cycles. From the above outline description, it will be appreciated that important aspects of this packaging and memory system include the precision and control of the digital analogue and analogue digital conversion processes, especially as applied to the data signals, the manner of mapping, derivation of the base reference signals, functioning of the nodes, and organisation of the MICTR in relation thereto. Some of these aspects and certain stages of the system will now be described in more detail. D A and A fl Data Signal Conversion It will also be apparent in general terms that the digitalto analogue conversions involve changing from a digital domain into an analogue domain wherein conventional Boolean logic with only two states, high or low, can no longer be directly applied.Nevertheless, with close control of all the conversion or transformation processes, the system can still be defined and treated mathematically using the concepts and methods of so called fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets which was first developed and described by L. A. Zadeh in treatises published circa 1965. In the present system, to help achieve the required accuracy and precision of digital to analogue conversions the D A converters are carefully designed and generally conversion is carried out separately on groups of no more than four bits representing decimal integers up to 9. In addition, the reference voltages supplied to the converters used may be adjustable under the control of theMICTR and accuracy and precision are ensured by sampling the voltage analogue signals generated and using reverse analogue todigital conversions in the ADC stage of the data converter 20 to provide again a digital signal of high resolution which is compared within the MICTR with the actual digital input to detect any error and, if necessary, produce a compensating control function to adjust the reference voltage and conversion factor of the relevantDAC sections. In practice, in checking the analogue signals they are modulated by a variable offset voltage and are sampled under the control of the MICTR to provide a range of signals of slightly different values which are applied to separate multiple inputs of the ADC stage. The numerical spectral transform method utilised in this process of controlling the conversions, involving providing the range of analogue signals, converting into digital with high resolution and comparing with the original digital signal, is under the control of the MICTR in accordance with rigorous mathematical transform algorithms which are micro coded and form part of the microprogram advantageously written or coded initially in APJ. language stored permanently in the ROM vector of the MICTR memory map space. In the data converter 20, the ADC stage serves the entire system, both for checking and for the reconstruction of the data in digital form during reading data out, and takes its signals from the analogue bus see FIGITRE 3 . The DAC stage, on the other hand, deals primarily with the incoming data bytes and, as shown inFIGURE 9a, may comprise a high precision 8 bit resolution DAC incorporating a stable reference current source and provided with a reference voltage REF controllable by the MICTR, together with a pair of so called quad transistor switches 60a, 60b, such as those available under reference numbers ICL 8018A and ICL 8019A Intersil , and a ladder resistor network driving a transconductance amplifier 66 a current to voltage converter .The circuitry is similar in many respects to that of the COUNT DAC and EXP DAC which are dealt with later. The basic form of the circuit of the ADC section is shown in FIGTJRE S from which it will be seen that a single conventional DAC 811 connected to an adjustable stabilised reference voltage source controllable by the MICTR and supplied with a digital input from a clock controlled up counter 82 drives several independent A fl converters each with a comparator Cos1, CMP2, etc. and corresponding 4 bit latch L1, I. , etc.Each of the latches receives and records the digital input direct from the counter 82 until the DAC output exceeds the analogue input V supplied to A the respective comparator at this point the comparator produces an output which operates the latch concerned so that it presents at its output and holds the digital value at which the comparator tripped. The DAC is continuously ramped upwards throughout its entire range so that during this period all the different analogue inputs V , V etc. to the comparators will trip and set their A1 A2 respective latches which then read out the equivalent digital values. With this design of multiple analogue to digital converter the total number of comparators and latches and therefore the overall bit length resolution is only limited by the drive capability of the DAC counter. Gain and level shifting applied to the analogue inputs will provide ADG1s with different ranges, and also the comparator latch commands can operate Sample and Hold circuits at the inputs, to signal data ready , and to inhibit further latching. The Base Address Counter and related Analogue Stages As mentioned, the base address counter 24 has an overall count up range of at least 0 to 999 x 10 providing an output in the form of a mantissa ranging up to 999 and a separate exponent to base 10 as indicated in the Table of Figure 6. Both components are output in binary coded decimal BCD digital form.The counter in effect counts the number of bytes input and the set of numbers or addresses generated provides the frame of the base reference address system onto which the individual data bytes are mapped for ordering and identification. A diagram of a basic base address counter circuit is shown inFIGURE 5. This consists of a set of seven decade counters, 70a to 70g, arranged to provide a seven stage divide by ten frequency divider, a multiplexer 72 which selects the divide ratio in use, three decade result counters 74a, 74b, 74c which respectively provide the BCD output for the three digit components of the mantissa, and a binary exponent counter 76 driven through a latch 78 from the carry output of the most significant bit MSB decade result counter. The BCD output of the exponent counter on the three output lines for the exponent count counter also provides the addressing signal to the multiplexer, and a fourth output line is used to carry a count overflow bit indicator. The latter is also connected to the multiplexer, to a disable input thereof. This circuit stage counts gated input trigger pulses derived from a control logic stage which effectively issues a trigger pulse each time a data byte is written into the memory system. Each successive input trigger pulse, and thus each data byte written in , increments the base address counter by one. It will be seen that for each exponent value an output of only three significant digits decimal can be provided by the result counters 74a, 74b, 74c, for the mantissa component so that not every number within the overall range can be output directly. Thus, in operation, starting from a true count of zero counting will proceed normally, with the multiplexer 72 set to the first input line taking the input trigger pulses directly, until a count of 999 is reached which is output by the result counters, the exponent counter remaining set at zero output. On the next input pulse, the units and tens result counters reset to zero while the hundreds result counter 74c resets to 100 decimal and also outputs a carry bit to the exponent counter 74 which increments to one decimal . The changed output of the exponent counter is presented in BCD on its output lines and also resets the multiplexer 72 to select the second input line from the output of the first stage decade counter 74a in the frequency divider chain.For subsequent input trigger pulses, therefore, only every tenth one is counted and registered by the result counters until ten thousand is reached, at which stage the result counters are again reset, the exponent counter is incremented to 2 decimal and the multiplexer is reset to select the third input line from the output of the second stage decade counter in the frequency divider chain and then every hundredth input pulse is counted. This process is repeated at every further ten fold multiple, and the 7 form of the output throughout the count up range up to q99 x 10 is as indicated in the Table of FIGURE 6. It will he apparent that this arrangement in effect divides the overall counter range into eight sub ranges or levels which are a feature of this system, and in order to be able effectively to provide a unique identification address for each incoming data byte in the upper levels a technique is introduced of modifying the exponent output value by subjecting it to a precisely controlled time based variable scaling before the mapping combination with the voltage analogue signal equivalent of that respective data byte. For the mapping with the data byte voltage analogue signals, the digital output of the base address counter is also converted with high precision into equivalent voltage analogue form. First, the BCD mantissa component is converted to its nines complement in the MICTR and is then output on a 12 line bus 26 to a digitalto analogue converter count DAC 28. The BCD exponent component, similarly also converted into its nines complement , is output on 3 lines of a four line bus 36 to a further digital to analogue converter EXP DAC 38. The digital output of the base address counter 24 is also held in the MICTR 14 for other processing and storage of parameters relating thereto, and in particular the mantissa component is combined with the digital value of the corresponding respective data byte input extracted from the data input register by, in effect, subtracting the data byte digital value from the nine s complement of the mantissa component to provide a further mapped reference quantity which is entered in the parameter register store 62 and, inter alia, can be utilised in a test loop routine of the programmed operation of the MICTR for checking and interpreting the data and analogue values. The COUNT DAC 28 is a high precision 12 bit converter of which a circuit diagram is shown in FIGURE 9b. A voltage analogue output is obtained by a current to voltage transconductance operational amplifier 74 in the final stage from an analogue output current derived from the sum of the currents from the three socalled quad 4 bit transistor switching units 76a, 76b, 76c which may be monolithic integrated circuit elements such as those available under the references IGL8018A IGL8019A 8020A Intersil .A stable value for the collector current of the reference transistor within the quad switch integrated circuit is provided by using a high gain operational amplifier to compare this collector current against a reference current generated in a resistor network by a temperature compensated zener diode stabilised using an operational amplifier regulated supply. The voltage analogue output from the COUNT DAC 28 is subsequently compressed by passing through a logarithmic amplifier stage 30 before feeding to the summing amplifier 32 to provide one component of the base reference mapping analogue. The EXP DAC 38 is similar to the count DAC 28 except that it utilises only one quad switching stage 90 to deal with the BCD exponent output on the 4 line bus from the counter 3 lines for theO to 7 exponent range and the fourth line for the Base Count overflow bit . The voltage analogue output of the EXP DAC is then passed to a time based analogue function generator 40 of which the circuitry is shown in FIGURES 10 and 11, FIGURE 10 being an input stage andFIGURE 11 being an output stage. In effect, this analogue function generator 40 provides a voltage analogue output which is related to the voltage analogue input, over a predetermined range of the latter, by a precisely controllable or programmable variable functional relationship or characteristic curve, as shown for example in FIGURE 12c, the control being exercised through the MICTR, and enables a controllable time dependent relationship and mapping. Since the value of the voltage analogue input V depends e on the number of bytes and changes with every level of the base counter reached through the exponent range 0 to 7 complemented values 9 to 2 , it is also a time dependent quantity, as indicated schematically in the diagram of FIGURE 12a, and by means of the analogue function generator stage the stepped form of graph of the latter can be converted into a smoother time dependent relationship as illustrated in FIGURE 12c. To explain the operational principle of the circuit, the predetermined range of the input the voltage analogue from the EXPDAC 38 is considered to be sub divided into nine sub ranges by defining ten break voltages which are nominally equally spaced throughout the input range. In the input stage FIGURE 10 of the circuit, a coarse measurement of the analogue input voltage, determining the relevant sub range in which it falls, is achieved by applying the input voltage in effect to a series of voltage sensitive switches which close at the different break voltage levels equally spaced throughout the input voltage signal range, and a fine measurement is achieved as will be explained by superimposing on the input voltage signal a periodic second probe voltage signal having a symmetrical triangular waveform and an amplitude exactly equal to the difference in adjacent levels of the voltage sensitive switches . This triangular waveform signal, for a given input voltage signal which is steady for the measurement period being considered, thus causes the voltage sensitive switch for the nearest break voltage level, and the voltage sensitive switch for the next lower level, to switch on and off alternately so that they each produce pulse signals having particular values of mark to space ratio m.t.s.r. according to the actual value of the input voltage signal in the sub range concerned.The relative percentage values of the m.t.s.r. of the output of the switch of the two adjacent break voltage levels, measurable by averaging the pulse signals in a CR network of suitable time constant, then gives a precise measure of the input voltage signal in terms of its value within the particular sub range of the predetermined overall range. Interpolation between adjacent break voltage levels by reference to averaged m.t.s.r. values is a feature of this analogue generator. Referring now to FIGURE 10, the voltage sensitive switches are provided by a string of nine comparators, IC4 to IC12 inclusive, set to trip change state at equally spaced successively increased voltage levels. The input analogue voltage is linearly scaled by a scaling amplifier IC3 and is applied to the non inverting input of the comparators IC4 to IC12. Upon scaling such that the overall range of the analogue voltage input is divided into nine equal intervals represented by ten break voltages of O, 1, 2, 3, .... 9, then the comparators IC4 to 1012 will be set to trip respectively at these levels. The additional switching triangular waveform for the m.t.s.r.or time averaging interpolation technique is provided by the probe waveform generator section which includes the amplifiers IC1 andIC2, and this waveform is added to the voltage analogue input at the scaling amplifier IC3 stage. The effect of this probe waveform is further illustrated in the diagram of FIGURE 12b. As will be seen, the direct output of each comparator IC4 to IC12 in the circuit of FIGURE 10 is passed, along diode protected lines, into an encoder IC13 which provides an inverted BCD digital output embodying, by its value and periodic variation, the information about the input signal and this digital output is applied to drive the output stage of the analogue function generator shown in FIGURE 11. Basically, after inversion in an invertor IC14, each BCD state fed into this output stage is caused, through a decoder switching unit IC15, to switch on a respective one of ten voltage levels all of which are pre set by calibration potentiometers VR3 toVR12. Successive voltage levels thus switched on still reflecting the m.t.s.r. of the output from the input stage ofFIGURE 10 are then summed through a summing amplifier IC16 and passed through a second order RC filter which finally averages the signals before being output through a buffer amplifier IC17 and adjustable scaling output amplifier IC18. It will be seen that the magnitude of the original voltage analogue input effectively determines which voltages are switched on and off and what m.t.s.r. is applied to these switched voltages in this output stage. However, the magnitude of each of the switched voltages, and therefore the way in which the average of the voltages changes as the m.t.s.r. of each varies, is dependent on the setting of the calibration potentiometers and this determines the actual shape after scaling of the nine segment function characteristic curve FIGURE 12 generated. Since each of the switched voltages are independently adjustable so are the levels of the break points in the characteristic curve, while each segment of the curve joins smoothly with adjacent segments.This gives great versatility and enables almost any characteristic curve for an input output function, capable of being approximated by a nine segment straight line fit method, to be produced. The so called calibration potentiometers VR3 VR12 in this function generator are in fact digitly controlled variable resistors and are controlled by the MICTR. By this circuit and effectively adding an offset value to the exponent voltage analogue it is possible to allot a unique address voltage analogue value for each byte in the higher count levels and maintain identification thereof. The Nodes and Data Deposition As already mentioned, the nodes 12 each include a capacitive element which exhibits rharacteristics of a variable capacitor under digital control by the MLCTR. A schematic simplified diagram of the basic circuit of the pseudo variable capacitive element stage of a single node is shown in FIGURE 4 from which it will be seen that it comprises a capacitive element C , provided by a passive network of high grade capacitors and resistors, which is electronically adjustable through a digital switch controlled variable resistor or potentiometer, generally designated RN, and a pair of operational amplifiers IC1A and IC1B connected as voltage followers. The digital switch controlling the potentiometer VRN is a 4 bit latch 54 which receives its control signals through part of the internal data bus 19 of the system and an enable signal through a Pot.Sel. line from the tGCTR. A simplified explanation of this circuit is as follows. If it be assumed that a voltage V be applied to the input terminalX, this voltage appears at the output of IC1A and is attentuated by the potentiometer VRN to a reduced value kV which is then applied through IClE to one pole of the capacitive element C .This element C has its opposite pole connected directly to the input so that the potential difference across it is l k V and the effective capacitance seen by the input between terminals X and Y is C 1 k V, k heing a variable fraction set by VRN. The effective capacitance can thus he varied from practically zero to the full value C . This stage of the node can thus he regarded as being a variable capacitor C as indicated in the equivalent N circuit diagrams of FIGURE 4a. In practice, the operational amplifiers, IC1A and IC1B must have extremely high input resistance and may be implemented by a dual FET input operational amplifier 16 pin IC package such as that available under a type reference number ICL 8043. Also, the requirements for C are very critical because theoretically a perfect capacitor with no loss and high stability characteristics is required. Thus, in the passive network shown, which represents an equivalent capacitive element C of 1000 pf, all the capacitors are precision silvered mica and the complete element is oven mounted and factory calibrated to give an element with a stability of the order of 1 part in one million and a residual phase angle difference from pure capacitance of one microradian. In each node, the pseudo variable capacitive element stage ofFIGURE 4 is connected across an operational amplifier, as shown atIC2A in the schematic diagram of FIGURE 13, so as to provide an operational integrator circuit, and it is by acting as an integrator that charge from an incoming data voltage analogue signal is deposited on the capacitive element. As indicated, however, the circuit is also arranged to operate in an alternative sample and hold mode selected by a switching circuit 80, the particular mode of operation again being under the control of theMICTR. The number of nodes 12 provided will depend upon the storage range and access speeds required, but in the present example there are eight nodes and a capacity of approximately 9.9 gigabytes of digital data may be achieved in accordance with the data storage structure indicated by FIGURE 7. In this arrangement, NODES 1 to 7 are used for the storage of the mapped data but NODE 8 is used as a temporary store for extracting data and for other purposes as will be subsequently more fully explained. When a mapped data analogue signal is applied to a node, as indicated above the node is in an integrator mode and the integration voltage or potential V representing the charge int level tO ramps upwards for a predetermined time integration period , set by the MICTR programmed control. This process, relative to a base voltage reference level, for several successive mapped data signals derived from successive bytes B1, B2, B3 etc.is shown in a somewhat exaggerated form by the graph z in FIGURE 15. Thus, the charge level after deposition of each byte of mapped data provides the base level for the next on that particular node. It will be understood that for a given input signal voltage the slope of the graph z is dependent on the value of the capacitorC and thus on the setting of the digital potentiometer VRN. The N latter in effect varies the characteristic integration value and provides a time scaling control, enabling the slope of the ramp to he altered as indicated at z . Voltage scaling can also be introduced by altering the base reference voltage level, as indicated at z . The time scaling control in particular helps to accommodate within reasonable output voltage levels a wide range of compression of the mapped data signals characterised by a range of different integration periods or sampling times, but also provides a time dependent mapping reference within the system.As will be seen from the Table in FIGURE 7, very high degrees of compression are required on the higher nodes, and the integration periods will be altered accordingly with a different value for each node and appropriate scaling will be applied as mentioned above. In general, with a sequential storage of data input the data bytes will be mapped and applied to the respective nodes in accordance with the distribution shown in FIGURE 7 which is programmed in the MICTR. Input and output connections to the nodes may be regarded as being established through the switching unit stage 46 indicated in FIGURE 1, but it will be appreciated that this includes numerous different programmed dynamic switching functions needed in the various cycles of operations. A typical set of input or output paths, for example for NODE 1, is shown very schematically in the diagram of FIGURE 14 which also shows that some of these paths are routed via cyclic switching stages, such as that labelled TSS, which feed in sequence to different nodes in a programmed time scan period analogous to cyclic switching stages in time division multiplex communications systems. A cyclic switching stage of this kind will for example be used in the refresh path so that all nodes can be regularly refreshed, after all the input data has been stored, by associated refresh circuitry programmed through the MICTR in accordance with information from the stored parameters relating to the last recorded charge level of each node concerned. File input and processing Returning now, however, in more detail to an example of the general operation of writing in data as previously indicated this will be organised as a file identified by a particular file name held in a 12 byte vector in the Host RAM space see FIGURE 2 . At the commencement of a write operation, following a preliminary signal on the FC1 line which initiates some basic housekeeping operations by the MICTR, the file name bytes or a selected part thereof are transferred to the MICTR RAM space. They are therefore mapped to the initial address of the base address counter and, including a count of several byte times introducing a time dimension , the mapped file name is processed as described for data and the corresponding analogue is deposited on a node utilising a distinctive integration constant significantly different to that utilised for later depositing mapped data within the file. The aim is to provide thereby a distinctive time key which can be recognised as a file name when subsequently extracting data.Also, the composite digital value of the file name bytes mapped will be chosen so as to lie outside the range 0 to 255 of data bytes in the system. As also previously mentioned, the data is transferred and processed in blocks. In this example, as indicated in FIGURE 3, the input source or data buffer in the MICTR RAM has a capacity of 16K bytes which represents the maximum size of block which will be processed at any one stage. With large files, further blocks will be dealt with sequentially. When a data block is transferred into the data buffer, before proceeding with processing and storage, the bytes therein are first checked by the microprocessor through a suitable algorithm to detect any values or strings likely to cause difficulty or ambiguity in mapping to the complemented base address counter values. Thus, certain combinations of addresses and data values could result in the same digital mapped data value. For example, a first byte value of 02 mapped subtractively to a base address value would give the same mapped value as a next byte of value 01 bearing in mind that the base address counter increments complement decrements by one for each byte. Also, once a data byte of one particular value has been received and stored a method needs to be introduced so that it is unnecessary to store that same value again independently for any subsequent byte. In practice, the range 0 to 255 of digital byte values are held in one or more look up tables in the parameter register, and upon storing the digital mapped data values as reference values in main memory pointers are set to indicate the actual data values in a respective look up table. In the case of a plurality of bytes having the same value after the first entry, for each subsequent one the relevant main memory address for holding the digital mapped value may be filled with the digital mapped value of the first entry together with a marker to make it unique indicating that the address content represents only a pointer. This marker, like the file name , may through the programmed control also be linked to a distinctive integration value when the relevant analogue mapped equivalent of this byte is deposited on a node whereby it can be identified when being extracted. In some cases, the fact that the above routine for handling bytes of identical value results in the mapped values of these bytes. after the first not being specifically entered releases these values, which may be termed key values , for possible use in mapping other data values whose normal mapped value would duplicate another thereby avoiding this difficulty. In other cases of conflict producing duplicate mapped data values, however, the microprocessor may he programmed to arrange for another different kind of mapping to be performed or in further cases of difficulty methods of bit redundancy and discarding certain values may have to he adopted which can be handled by suitable algorithms. ITse of such key values or other special technique may again be linked to a distinctive integration value when depositing the corresponding analogue mapped value, and it will he appreciated that this technique of introducing distinctive integration values for particular data bytes which would otherwise cause mapping problems represents a further way of introducing and mapping in respect of a time domain. After the preliminary checking of the bytes of the data block in the data buffer and organising any necessary remedial action to meet any problems predicted as referred to above, the MICTR will initiate the main processing and storage of the data block with each byte in turn being converted into the corresponding voltage analgoue and being mapped on to the analogue base address reference derived as previously described, followed by depositing the mapped analogue value on a selected node. At the end of depositing the last byte of the block, marked by the end of the integration period thereof, the capacitive element of the working node concerned then carries a packet of charge representing the total of all the mapped data bytes in the block accumulated in a known number of known time intervals, together with the file name mapped below on top of any previously stored data. The other nodes will also carry some charge since even if they do not contain any mapped data they are initially brought up to a certain base charge level. The next step is to sample the charge level or voltage built up on the working node and the analogue sample is digitised and passed back to the MICTR for storing in the parameter register store 62. Digitisation of this sample is achieved by feeding it back via the data return path designated 50 in FICJTRE 1 to theA D converter stage of the data converter 20 which serves the whole system. To obtain the further data required for storage, and in particular all the parameters required for permanent storage for reconstituting the charge pattern on the nodes, a scanning operation is then carried out to derive a function defined by storable parameters representing this charge pattern within the time domain. In carrying out the scanning operation, first the charge level on the working node may be sampled and copied on to Node 8.This is then discharged for a set time during which voltage analogue signals are taken at clocked intervals via a sample and hold circuit and are digitised and passed to the MICTR for storage. The same operation is then likewise carried out in turn for each of the other nodes to complete a first scan. A second similar scan is then carried out using a different rate of clocked intervals for sampling the discharges, and these operations are again repeated several times, the scanning cycles being controlled by a loop algorithm. The values of the sampled voltage analogue signals thus obtained during each of the discharge periods represent coefficients of the required function taken along slices of the latter which is three dimensional in form. An illustration of this is shown in the diagram of FIGURE 16a which is a section through the slices mentioned and some of these are labelled S1, S2, S3 etc. for consecutive scans of nodes N1 to N7. The timing intervals between successive scans is relatively long compared to the integration times of the nodes and hence the coefficients obtained from these scans give only a rather coarse picture of the function. To obtain greater resolution and obtain further parameters, the following procedure is adopted. First, to work on node 1 this is again copied to node 8 and then node 1 is flushed i.e. completely discharged. A voltage analogue signal corresponding to the last mapped data on that node known from the parameters already stored is then applied to the empty node 1 for a time equal to a first time period t and at the end of this period the integrator voltage is sampled, digitised, and stored. This is then repeated for further time periods t , t 2 3 etc. until the total integration time of the last mapped data has been reached, as indicated in FIGURE 16b, and by simple arithmetic operations a value for charge built in the total integration time can be obtained to provide further co efficients in the nodal function. Afterwards a refresh cycle may be performed before the next block recycling via Node 8 which will incidentally bring the file name to the top of the node. Data Extraction To read from the memory it is necessary to try to reconstitute the charge level on the relevant node at the address of each data unit required, working sequentially through the file concerned and the programmed processing depends on the parameters stored. Although the complete process and algorithms are complex a brief outline of a typical read operation in respect of a stored file is given below. Initially, the relevant file name will be sent by the host to the memory module and from this identification the MICTR will recognise which of the seven nodes would hold the file and can further estimate, using a software prediction algorithm, a position or level within the node at which the file name marking the commencement of the file is likely to lie. This estimate is made in terms of a number of clocking time intervals below the top level of the last stored mapped data. It may be recalled at this stage that, inter alia, the MICTR holds the stored digital values of the last stored data byte and address together with the mapped data value. These values are stored per node. Also, the stored, mapped file name contains a characteristic File Key, provided by the distinctive value allotted outside the range of normal data values and also a Time Key provided by the distinctive integration period used when it was stored on the node, and these Key values are also held in store. First, the charge level on the working node concerned is copied on to Node 8 and charge is taken off quickly in a discharge cycle against a clocked count to bring it to the estimated position of the mapped file name . At the level reached, the charge is sampled and the voltage analogue is fed back, digitised and passed to the MICTR. On then taking off the next charge in a controlled discharge period matched to the Time Key integration period, a further sample is taken, digitised and compared with the previous.The difference should yield the digital mapped value and is compared with the File Key value to confirm. If it is not correct and the position has been misjudged, a further copy of the working node can be copied on to node 8 and a further trial carried out.Thus, a search may be continued in the same region of the node until the file name is located. The start of the file has now been reached and the subsequent mapped data units must be taken off and the data values separated from the base address. At this stage the present base address is known. A discharge cycle is then carried out mapped to the relevant integration period for that file and node, and the next level is sampled and digitised to obtain the mapped data value taken off. By difference with the known address, the data value is found. This data value needs to be checked, however, to ensure that no errors have arisen in tracking or otherwise. In one checking routine, the digital value derived may be passed through the system again, transformed into analogue and put back on the node NODE 8 , followed by a fresh discharge scan, as shown as q in FIGURE 17. A second digital value differing by one may then be derived by decrementing in RAM and this is placed on the node to obtain another discharge scan indicated at p in FIGURE 17. By this repeated operation with the dynamic functioning of the system and applying predictive algorithms, a reliable and accurate true data value can be confirmed. This process is then repeated level by level through the node keeping a running count, until the end of the file is reached. It will be appreciated that the non volatile parameter register store has a very large information capacity with the arrangement of 256 x 32 bit registers since the bits can be read in many different arrangements of selected groups and the same information may be read in different ways. A major factor in the enormous potential capacity of this system, however, is believed to be the introduction of the time domain as a versatile mapping base, and this is also applicable to the parameter store in that in considering groups of bits, individual members can change value within opposite ends of software timing loops so that time becomes an additional dimension in relation to the information capacity of the system, and mathematical methods of fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets are applicable. With this radically different approach, it is possible to achieve exceptional degrees of compression. It may be noted, however, that the information for setting up and reconstituting the charge patterns on the nodes is largely contained in the stored coefficients of the nodal function which has characteristics of three dimensional modelling with two time domains and the essential parameters can be contained in a relatively small area of working memory, and this gives considerable scope for packet transmission of data between intercommunicating units. As seen, the parameters maintained via the MICTR and stored in the parameter register store 62 are used in connection with the continual recycling and refreshing of the stored data held on the nodes as mentioned above, and also in connection with i effecting precise control of data input and output during read write cycles, ii replenishing the nodes at cold start after the unit has been switched off this may be achieved within 25 ms for 9.9 gigabytes storage , and iii extracting data in a read operation and in connection with the Transform phase by the MICTR permitting a data access time in the range of 200 300 nanoseconds to be achieved in this example . A charged packet memory device such as described thus provides non volatile very high density memory storage for digital data which is suitable for use in any general purpose microcomputer, mini computer or other data acquisition system. As mentioned, the device described can provide a total storage density of 9.9 gigabytes of digital data which is transformed to analogue form, dynamically compressed and mapped at high precision into the node storage units using a Base Address Counter as the mapping 7 reference in a range of o to 999 x 10 .The memory module storage range can, however, be readily expanded further such as to 15 yield, for example, a byte storage range of 0 to 999 x 10 Features and advantages of the design employed include a Very low power consumption compared to normal solid state storage mediums, being typically of the order 2.5 to 3 AMPS in the worst case. b The module is totally solid state and of small physical size, and interfacing into existing computer systems requires no modifications to the system circuitry. c Random access possible and high access speed, typically of the order 200 300 nS. d Extremely low production costs in comparison to existing storage units of less density range. e Impervious to high magnetic fields, charges and radiation. The module has a very stable temperature coefficient operating range under extreme environmental charges. f Impervious to high vibration ahd shock forces. Used in general digital and computer technology applications, charged packet memory devices of the form described should more than adequately meet the normal requirements of high speed highaccuracy bulk buffer storage and can provide significant advantages over conventional non solid state mass data buffer storage systems such as magnetic tape, card or disc. Having regard to the inherent accuracy and high precision control, charged packet memory devices as described can also be used interconnected in pairs in communications systems providing high density, high speed and low bandwidth data transmission networks, as indicated in the diagram of FIGURE 18. Thus, in this arrangement the entire charged packet representing the whole stored contents of one memory module or device can be output or down loaded in block form over a low bandwidth transmission line data link direct to a remotely located second memory module or device.
