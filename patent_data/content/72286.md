## Description
The present invention relates to the use of an organic amide compound, for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product for the treatment of disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system as well as to the new compounds belonging to this family and to the pharmaceutical compositions containing these new compounds. It more precisely concerns a family of organic amide compounds to be used for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product for the treatment of the central or peripheral nervous system in vivo it also concerns the new compounds belonging to this family as well as the pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Numerous compounds are known to be active in vitro and yet exhibit little or no activity in vivo. In particular, numerous carboxylic acids are known to be important in the actions of the peripheral and central nervous systems and are active in vitro but are either non active or only slightly active in vivo. Gamma aminobutyric acid GABA , for example, is known to be active on the central nervous system in vitro and has been suggested as a possible inhibitory transmittor Louis S. Goodman and Alfred Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 4th Ed., p. 429 1970 . Further US P 4 129 650 describes the use of phospholipid derivatives to lowering blood pressure and is restricted to the use of such derivatives where at least one of the R₁ and R₂ substituents is a fatty acid radical. Chemical abstracts 68 1978 87545g discloses compounds to be used as prototypes for biological studies of bioactive phosphatidopeptides no specific pharmaceutical properties are described in said reference. In CA 95 1981 81537 are described muramylpeptides presenting immunopotentializing properties and in CA 66 1967 prototypes of biological active phosphatidopeptides with alanine or glycyl substituents are described. None of these references concern however the enhanced and direct action on the central or peripheral nervous system in vivo and more precisely the use for the prevention of convulsive states and the treatment of behavorial alterations resulting from modifications of neuropeptide hormones of compounds according to the present invention. The present inventors have found that compounds of the formula I , prepared by combining a carboxylic acid, such as GABA, with a phospholipid or sphingolipid, provide amide compounds which are active in vivo exhibiting activities far superior to that of the corresponding carboxylic acid or lipid compounds administered alone. For example, the amide of GABA with a sphingosine provides a compound which is far more active in vivo than is GABA alone. Similarly, lysergic acid, dihydrolysergic acid and isolysergic acid are essentially inactive when administered alone, but when combined with a sphingosine provide compounds of the formula I which have significant in vivo activity as measured by hypoprolactinemic effects in rats. The significantly improved pharmacological properties of the compounds of formula I are thought to result from the ability of these compounds to penetrate the hematoencephalic barrier and or reach the peripheral organs far better than the carboxylic acid compounds alone. This ability of the compounds of the present invention favors the interaction between the biologically active compound, such as the carboxylic acid, and the situs of the specific interactions present in the membranes. Hence, the compounds of the present invention are useful for enhancing or increasing the in vivo biological activity of in vitro biologically active carboxylic acids, as well as stimulating the in vivo biological activity of in vitro biologically active carboxylic acids which have little or no in vivo activity, so that they can be used therapeutically as pharmaceutical products for the treatment of disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system. The present invention concerns more specifically the use of an organic amide compound for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical product for the treatment of disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system, said organic amide compound having the formula wherein The invention also concerns the organic amide compound of the formula wherein The invention also concerns, more generally, pharmaceutical compositions containing as active substance, an organic amide compound such as defined here above. Natural fatty acids and esters derived from hydroxy substituted natural fatty acid groups linked to nitrogen of natural phospholipids or shingolipids are described in, for example Wiegandt, The R₁ COOH acids which give rise to the R₁ CO residue are those acids which are fundamentally important to the peripheral and central nervous systems, such as lysergic, isolysergic, dihydrolysergic, 2 bromolysergic, 2 bromodihydrolysergic, 1 methyllysergic, 1 methyldihydrolysergic, 1 methyl 2 bromo lysergic, 1 methyl 2 bromodihydrolysergic, gamma aminobutyric, valproic 2 propylpentanoic , trimethoxybenzoic, nicotinic, isonicotinic, picolinic and theophyllineacetic acids. These acids have the common pharmaceutical characteristic of being active R₂ may be a hydrogen atom or an alkyl having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms such as butyl, isobutyl, tertiarybutyl, propyl, isopropyl, ethyl, and methyl or a cycloalkyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, such as cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl. The N R₃ residue is derived from a nitrogenous lipid, especially from phospholipids and sphingolipids. Phospholipids, natural products that can be extracted from bovine brain tissue, are chemically derived from L α glycerophosphoric acid. Lees, M. B., The two major phospholipid groups which are utilized are the phosphatidylethanolamines II and the phosphatidylserines III represented by the following structures wherein Sphingolipids are natural products extracted, in particular, from animals and vegetables and contain an amino alcohol moiety Dawson, Form and Function of Phospholipids, Ed. by Ansell et al, Biochem. Biophys. Acta. Library, Vol. 3, pp. 104 105 1973 Kaller, Biochem. Zeitschrift, Vol. 334, pp. 451 456 1961 Sweeley et al, J. Lipid, Res., Vol. 1, pp. 40 47 1959 Radin, Lipids, Vol. 9, pp. 358 360 1970 . Especially preferred sphingosines are those having an average of 12 to 22 carbon atoms. The sphingolipid derivatives which permit the preparation of the compounds I of the present invention contain a sphingosinic residue and contain a free sphingosine NH₂ group. Principally these are wherein wherein wherein wherein wherein wherein wherein The organic amides I according to the present invention can be prepared according to a variety of preparation methods under conditions which prevent the esterification of the free carboxy group. Of all the methods which have proved to be particularly appropriate, the following are most preferred In the preparation of the products described in formula I derived from gamma aminobutyric acid, the method preferably used is that consisting of the initial preparation of a gamma aminobutyric derivative where the amino group is protected, as for example, by a phthaloyl or benzyloxycarbonyl group. The derivative thus prepared is then further condensed with the nitrogenous lipid using one of the reactions previously described. The protective group is then eliminated by means of an appropriate reaction and the product I is thus obtained. For example, if the protective group is phthaloyl, this group could be eliminated by hydrazinalysis. The compounds of formula I , wherein the R₁ COOH acid contains a basic group for example, gamma aminobutyric, nicotinic, lysergic or dihydrolysergic acid , can be salified with therapeutically acceptable acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, methanesulphonic and malic acids.
