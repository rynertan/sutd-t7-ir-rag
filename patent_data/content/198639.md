## Description
THE DETERMINATION OF ALBUMIN AND A CARRIER A4D FIXATION TECHNIQUE USABLE THEREIN The total protein amount and the albumLn globulin ratio in serum bear a significant clinical importance in diagnoses of malnutrition, hepatic disorders, renal diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoiimmine diseases, and so forth. It is well known that proteinuria is closely related with renal diseases, and research into the nature of renal diseases by protein analysis has become popular in recent years. Although certain types of serum proteins Pass through the renal glomeruli, more than 95 of the proteins filtered through the glomeruli are reabsorbed at the renal tubules. Proteinuria means that the amount of total protein excreted into the urine per da,t exceeds 100 150 mg Ishimoto et al. Sogo Rinsho, 271 1223 12291 1978 . In a normal subject, albumin accounts for about 80X of the urinary proteins which mainly consist of proteins with a relatively small molecular weight among all serum proteins. At present, proteinuria is classified into 2 types one originating from the glomerulus and the other from the renal tubules. The urinary proteins of patients with glomerulonephritis or many other renal diseases consist mainly of albumin with a molecular weight of 67,000, whereas both proteins with molecular weight of 150ss000 or more and those with molecular weight of 60,000 or less are scarce glomerular proteinuria .InFanconi s syndrome or renal tubular disorders due to heavy metal or drug intoxication, proteins filtered through the glomerulus are excreted into the urine without being reabsorbed. Daily total protein excreted into the urine is relatively small in amount and consists mainly of proteins with low molecular weights less than 60,000 renal tubular proteinurea . Accordingly, the determination of albumin is essential for studies on the causes of diseases, especially diseases due to renal disorders. their therapies, and diagnoses, and has a significant clinical importance. Conventional methods for the determination of albumin are roughly classified into two classes methods to determine fractionated albumin salting out methods, electrophoresis , and methods to determine specifically albumin alone chromometry .Of the former, the history of the salting out method is long, but it has scarcely been used because electrophoresis has become more practicable. Chromometry is a method widely adopted in clinical fields for example, the BCG Method Dumas et al., Clin Chim. Acta., 31, 87, 1971 is a method to determine the increase in absorbance at 630 nm, which is caused by bonding to albumin Bromcresol green BCG reagent which is dissolved in citric acid buffer solution at pH 4.2 containing nonionic surfactant Brij 35. Some simplified methods, such as Esbach s method, Sueyoshi s method, chromometry, and so on, are also clinically used. A recently developed coomassie brilliant blue G250 method Tonein TP method Kit, Otsuka Assay has made possible the determination of protein at the concentration of 10 100 mg L, but this is the determination for total proteins in urine, not for albumin specifically. In the Japanese PatentUnexamined Publication No. 53 47517, a method for the determination of antigen protein by using a cellulose membrane was disclosed, but the cellulose membrane is difficult to handle and is poor in reproducibility.In another method for determination using anti human albumin antibody sensitized red blood cells or latex particles Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.54 80410, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.55 30654 , the dilution ratios of samples are so wide that significant errors might occur.Fractionation by electrophoresis has a high separation capacity, but the dyes used for detection of the fraction bands have varied in absorption capacity depending upon the types of proteins, and have problems in determination accuracy.Furthermore, even if a simplified cellulose acetate membrane is used, handling is so complicated that it requires extremely proficient techniques besides, the determination takes a long time. In the case of the BCG method, since there is a difference in the time course of coloration between an albumin standard solution and albumin contained in serum or other vital samples in the latter the coloration is gradually intensified, and the higher the temperature rises the stronger the coloration becomes , deviations in the determination time and in the temperature lead to large errors. Moreover, Y globulin also shows 2 3 of cross reactivity and, therefore, this can not be regarded as a qualitative and quantitative determination specific to albumin Doumas et al., Clin. Chim. Acta., 31. 87, 1971 . In addition, since the lower limit of detection of theBCG method is 20g L, it can not be applied to the detection of albumin in urine. On the other hand, the lower limites for detection of the simplified methods such as Esbach s method, Sueyoshi s method, colorimetry etc., are only 300 500 mg L but the reactions by these methods are hardly specific to albumin. Accordingly, simplified. accurate and economical determination methods, which have sufficient sensitivity for determinations without diluting or condensing the samples, have long been awaited. The invention provides the use of albumin or anti albumin antibody, in either case fixed to a low temperature plasma treated membrane carrier, in the determination of albumin. This invention relates to the determination of albumin by means of an enzyme immunoassay employing a hydrophilic membrane carrier treated with low temperatures plasma Japanese Patent Application No.58 199856 Japanese Patent Application No. 59 2776S6 . Thus, anti albumin antibody or albumin may be made to contact and be fixed with a membrane carrier into which a certain amount of aldehyde groups have been introduced. Then various kinds of immuno reactions are made to occur between the carrier and the albumin or anti albumin antibody which is conjugated with an enzyme 1,label 1 such as glucose oxidase GOD and horesradish peroxidase HOP for measuring the enzyme activity colorimetrically or electrical output is used for the determination of albumin. The present invention enables the determination of albumin conveniently and quickly and the assay specifically of albumin contained in samples in trace to large amounts by making use of the specificity of the antigen antibody reaction.Thus, in case of the electical output, albumin in samples can be specifically determined with a sensitivity of 0.5 160 mg L in case of colorimetry, 0.03 4mg L, with a reaction time ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours in both methods.Accordingly, the present method can provide important information not only for diagnoses of various diseases, especially renal disease, but also for prevention, early diagnosis, and prognosis.

The present invention has been effected after great efforts to develop a new method for determining albumin contained in medium or serum, especially in urine, accurately, conveniently and economically. 1 Treatment of the membrane carrier In the same way as described in JapanesePatent Application No. 58 199856 and Japanese PatentApplication No. 59 277656, porous polyolefin membranes etc. are treated with acetone, depending on necessity, and then treated with low temperature plasma to be made hydrophilic. The treatment with low temperature plasma may be performed on the whole or a part of the surface, and may be performed on both sides or one side of the membrane. Next, said membrane is treated with 0.02 10 aqueous octamethylenediamine solution. Depending upon the concentration of aqueous octamethylenediamine solution, any desired amount of protein can be combined with the membrane.With concentrations lower than the above mentioned level, protein scarcely combines with the membrane, whilst with concentrations higher than the above level. the amount of protein to be combined with the membrane is saturated. Next, after the membrane is washed with phosphate buffer solution hereafter abbreviated as PB , phosphate buffered saline thereafter abbreviated as PUBS and so forth, aldehyde groups are introduced into the membrane with glutaraldehyde and so on. After washing with PB, PFS etc., the membrane. the whole surface of which is treated with low temperature plasma, is cut to pieces of 0.5 15 mm diameter. 23 Fixation of anti albumin antibody or albumin Anti albumin antibody or albumin is fixed on the membrane carrier treated in the above mentioned manner. The anti slbumin antibody can be obtained by the following method Highly purified albumin containing no globulin, together with an adjutant, is injected several times into animals such as rabbits ,goats, and guinea pigs. Then, blood samples are collected to prepare antisers, to which antiseptics are added for storage, and used as anti albumin antibody. Commercial snti albumin antibody may also be used.With PBS and so on, the Åanti albumin antibody should be diluted 1,500 to 3,000 times when determined colorimetrically it should be diluted 100 400 times when determined by electrodes. Albumin should be diluted to 0.001 4 g l, and more suitably to 0.05 0.2 g l, When the diluted solution is dropped onto the membrane, 5 100 l, more suitably 10 20 1, of the solution is used. When the membrane is steeped in the diluted solution, lOO 11000 1, more suitably 30 400 ill, of it is used. The membranes are allowed to stand for 10 minutes to 48 hours, more suitably for S 2L hours, at 4 30 C for fixation of anti albumin antibody or albumin.The amount of antialbumin antibody or albumin to be fixed may be an amount necessary for the determination of ulbumin. After washing with PB, PBS, etc., the membrane carrier is treated with the normal serum of a goat.rabbit, guinea pig, etc. or bovine serum albumin for blocking unreacted groups on it, and is washed w PB, PBS, and so forth.3 Immunological reactions On the membrane treated as mentioned above, the following inOThgical reactions are made to occur. a. Sandwich method Albumin solution of So 500 1 to be examined is contacted with the membrane carrier havi g the fixed anti albumin antibody and is allowed to undergo immunological reaction for 10 minutes to 48 hours, preferably for 30 minutes to 3 hours, at 4 to 30 C, preferably at 250c Next, or simultaneously, an enzyme conjugated 2nti albumin antibody, diluted 10 3,000 times with PBS etc., containing surfactant such as Tween Trade Mark , is added to undergo immunological reaction for 10 minutes to 2 hours, preferably for 30 to 60 minutes, at 4 37 C, preferably at 30 to 35 C. Recommended enzymes used on this occasion include borseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase, ss D galactosidase, glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, etc. The enzyme conjugated anti albumin antibody can be prepared by conventional methods such the glutaraldehyde method using glutaraldehyde as a cross linking agent to bond the enzyme to the antibody the inalelinide method using maleimide as a cross linking agent, and so on b. Competitive method A solution of albumin to he examined, which is dissolved inPBS containing surfactant such as Tween etc. and a solution of enzyme coniugatet albumin are mixed in a sredetermined ratio.The mixed solution is made to react with the membrane carrier haw ing the fixed anti albumin antibody for 10 minutes to 48 hours at 4 to 35 C preferably for 30 to 60 minutes at 20 to 3000. The methods for the preparation of the enzyme and the enzyme conjugatet albumin, which are used here, are the same as employed in the above mentioned sandwich method. c. Competitive inhibition method Albumin to be examined is contacted with the membrane,carrier having the fixed albumin. Then an enzyme conjugated anti albumin antibody is added to induce an immunological reaction. The reaction conditions, enzymes and the preparation of enzymeconjugated anti albumin antibody are the same as those employed in the above mentioned sandwich method. A variety of innnanological reactions other than those mentioned above may he applicable.4 Detection The membrane carrier where an immunological reaction has been made to occur, as mentioned above, is washed with PBS, PB etc. and subjected to the detection of bonded enzymes. a. Colorimetry A color producing solution containing color formers such as ABUTS, diphenylamine etc. is contacted with the membrane carrier. When ABTS H2ot color producing solution is used, it is sufficient to react 100 500 g 1 of it with the carrier for 20 40 minutes at 30 35 C. Enzyme reaction inhibitors such as oxalic acid, sodium azide etc. are added to inhibit the reaction and the absorbance is determined. b. Electric output determination method Said membrane carrier is fixed to hydrogen peroxide electrodes, which are steeped into a substrate solution dissolved in PBS etc. When equilibrium is reached in about 30 seconds 1 minute, the electrical output is determined. The present invention removes the uncertainty of the prior art mentioned above, and enables the deternination of albumin conveniently and quickly and the assay speciflcally of albumin contained in samples in trace to large amounts by making use of the specificity of the antigen antibodht reaction. In the case of the electrode method, albumin in samples can be specifically determined with a sensitivity of 0.5 160 mg L and in case of colorimetry, O.03 4mg L, with a reaction time ranging from 10 minutes to 3 hours in both methods.Accordingly, the present method can provide important information not only for diagnoses of various diseases, especially of renal diseases, but also for prevention1 early diagnosis, and prognosis. In the following Examples several preferred embodiments of the present invention are described. However, it is to be understood that the present invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodimants Example 1 Microporous polypropylene film Juragard Gt3a00, 25 m thick, 0.02 x 0.2 m of the maximum aperture, hydrophilic, Polyplastics Co., Ltd., was treated with acetone, and one side of the membrane was treated for 30 min. with low temperature plasma or both sides of the membrane were treated for 20 minutes on each side.The treated membrane was steeped into 1 of aqueous octamethylenediamine solution and washed with water Then it was steeped into 25 glutaraldehyde solution. After being washed with water, the membrane was cut into pieces of 13 .Each of the obtained membrane pieces were put into each of Nunc 24 Well irniltidish the diameter of well about 16 mm, Nunc , to which 300g 1 of 3000 times tiluted goat anti human serum albumin antiserum Cappel was added, and allowed to stand for 3 6 hours at 4 C After the added antiserum was removed, the membrane piece was washed with O.1M of phosphate buffer solution hereafter abbreviated as PB in pH 7.3.Then, normal goat serum diluted 3000 times was added to it and allowed to stand overnight at 4 C After removal of the serum, 500 g 1 of human serum albumin hereafter abbreviated as lisA 131 2000 giL, 7 steps multiple dilution was added as a standard solution to react with the membrane for 30 and 6Q minutes when its both sides were treated with plasma, and for 60 minutes at 30 C when only one of the sides was treated.After the added standard HSA was removed, the membrane piece was washed with PB pH 7.3 . Then, 300 1 of 3 ,000 times diluted solution of goat anti HSA antibody IgG fraction,Cappel conjugated with horseradish peroxidase thereafter abbreviated as HRP , was added. Doible side plasma tr ated membranes were made to react for 30 minutes at 30 C , while single side treAted ones for 60 minutes. After removing the goat anti HSA antibody solution and washing with PB, 400 1 of ABUTS 2,2 Azino bis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulphonic acid H O color forming solution was added to react for 30 minutes at 30 C. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 ml of O. oxalic acid for determination of the absorbance at 420 nm. The results are shown in Fig 1. By the sandwich colorimetry, 0.23 4 mgiL of albumin can be determined.Example 2 In the same way as that employed in Example 1, standard curves were prepared using the standard HSA 31 2,000 U giL, 7 steps multiple dilution for determination of the concentration of albumin in human urine samples. In this case, in addition to the method of Example I two steps sandwich method , another method, the HRP con3ugsted anti HSA antibody was made to react simultaneously either with the standard RSA or with urine sample one step sandwich method was also performed The results are shown in Table 1.

Ashing treatment may be performed on the both sides or one side.Example 3 Similarly to Example 1, both sides of microporous polypropylene film Juragard 3400, Polyplastics Co., Ltd. were treated with low temperature plasms and cut into 13 . As enzymeconjugated antibody, glucose oxidase thereafter abbreviated as GOD rabbit anti HSA Fab was used as antiserum to be fixed, 1,000 times diluted solution of rabbit anti USA sntiserum and as a blocking agent, rabbit normal serum 330 times diluted . Enzyme immune reaction was performed similarly to Example 1.For each of the standard USA 31 4,000 g g L 8 steps multiple diluted solutions, 6 sheets of the membrane carrier were used. Three of them were used for colorimetry by ABTS HRP color forming solution.The remaining 3 sheets were settled to the hydrogen peroxide electrodes 2 , platinum3, which were steeped into 15 ml of phosphate buffered saline thereafter abbreviated as PBS containing 50 m of glucose as a substrate for measurement of the output current.

Polyplastics Co., Ltd. was cut into pieces 150 mm x 150 mm in size.One piece was placed between two similar size pieces of aluminium shielding covers with perforations 6 mm diameter, 36 holes drilled , and both the sides were treated with steam plasma 100 nA, 500 V for 3 minutes each to give hydrophilic spot membranes. Five to 10 U 1 of 0.3S octamethylenediamine was dropped on each spot. When the whole of a spot was wet to become translucent, the excess of water was wiped away with filter paper. Next, the membrane was steeped into 5 glutaraldehyde solution and was washed with distilled water or PBS.Method A Competitive method On each spot, 2Cy 1 of rabbit anti HSA antiserum 200 times diluted solution was dropped and the spots were left overnight at C. After removal of the antiserum and washing with PBS, 20 1 of normal rabbit serum or flgt 1 PBS containing containing bovine serum albumin hereafter abbreviated as BSA was dropped on the spot and left for 6 hours at 4 C.After removal of the added PBS, the spot was washed with PBS. Twenty microliters of the mixed solution of 150g 1 COD HSA and 150 g 1 standard HSA was dropped on the spot and left for one hour at 25 C.

Two minutes later 10 g 1 of GOD Fab from rabbit anti HSA IgG 30 times diluted solution was added and left for one hour at 25 C After washing with RTI ID 16.11 PES, the output current was measured with the electrodes in s way similar to Method A. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Accurate measurement of RSA can be achieved by both A and B methods in RSA concentrations of 0.5 160 mg L.Example S By the colorimetry according to the 2 steps sandwich method of Example 1, and method A and B in Example 4, urinary albumin was determined. At the same time, an addition recovery test was carried out. The addition recovery test is one where a certain amount of albumin is added to original urine for determination.

At the same time, an determination based upon the conventional BCG method was also performed for comparison. Standard HSA 1 80 mg L, 8 step multiple dilution Samples method A 1000, 3000 and 10000 times diluted serum PBS Tween Trade Mark BCG method Original serumThe results are shown in Table 3.

Five to 10 g 1 each of various concentrations of octamethylenediamine 5, 1, 0.25, O.l, 0.05, O.C25 and 0.0125 was dropped on each spot.It was air dried, or an excess of water was wiped away with filter paper when the whole of the spot was wet to become translucent. After being steeped into 5 glutaraldehyde solution, the spot was washed with distilled water or PBS. Each concentration of aqueous GOD solution 1, 2 and 5 g 50 1 spot was dropped on each spot and was preserved for 18 hours at 4 C in a plastic box where filter papers wetted with water was spread.Twenty g 1 of water was removed from the drop on each spot the residue to he put into 10 ml of PBS containing 50 mg of glucose and the output current was measured using the hydrogen peroxide electrodes 4 , platinum . The results are indicated in Fig. 4. When octamethylenediamine concentration is less than 0.25 , GOD amount fixed to the electrode are proportionsl to the concentrations of octamethylenediamine, but when the concentration is over 0.25X, saturated state is reached. Furthermore, when albumin, antialbumin antiserum etc. are fixed, it has been proved that an almost equal amount to the mass protein of GOD is fixed. That is, any desired amount of protein can be fixed by adjusting the concentration of octamethylenediamine.
