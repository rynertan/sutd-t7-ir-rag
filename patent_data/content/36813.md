## Description
N SUBSTITUTED CARBAMOYLOXY ALKYLENEOXY HYDROCARBYL ACRYLATE ESTERS The N substituted carbamoyloxy alkyl acrylates, such as 2 N methyl carbamoyloxy ethyl acrylate, are well known with the generic class disclosed in U.S. 3,479,328 and U.S. 3,674,838. These compounds have been found particularly effective in radiation curable compositions since they impart desirable properties to the prepared compositions and to the cured compositions. However, due to their sensitizing effect and toxicity they must be handled with extreme caution and, as a consequence, these features detract from their general acceptance and use. The novel N substituted carbamoyloxy alkylene oxyalkyl acrylate esters of this invention are those defin ed by the structural fQrmula EMI1.1 wherein R is an unsubstituted or substituted i linear or branched alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or ii aryl, alkaryl or aralkyl group having 6 or 10 ring carbon atoms or iii cycloalkyl group having from 5 to 8 ring carbon atoms, when x is 1, or iv polyvalent alkylene, arylene , alkarylene, aralkylene or cycloalkylene having carbon atom values defined for i to iii supra and a valence equal to the value of x, when x is greater than 1 wherein the substituents on the R group are not reactive with the isocyanato radical R is hydrogen or alkyl having from 1 to 2 carbon atoms R is a linear or branched divalent alkylene of 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms, divalent cycloalkylene of 5 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 6 to 8 carbon atoms, or divalent arylene of 6 to 10 ring carbon atoms X is hydrogen, methyl or cyano x has a value of from 1 to 4, preferably 1 or 2 and y is an integer having an average value of from 1 to 20, preferably from 1 to 6 and most preferably from 1 to 4. The novel compounds of this invention are produced, preferably, by a two step process that can, if desired, be carried out sequentially in the same reactor. The compounds have monofunctionality when a monoisocyanate is used in the second step of the reaction and polyfunctionality when a polyisocyanate is used. The polyfunctional acrylyl compounds can be used as crosslinkers in formulated compositions. In the first step of the reaction a hydroxyalkyl acrylate of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein I and Rt are as previously defined, is reacted with a vicinal alkylene oxide of the general formula EMI2.2 wherein R is as previously defined, to produce the adduct. Illustrative of suitable hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates or cyanoacrylates one can mention hydro xyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl cyanoacrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, hydroxybutyl methacrylate, hydroxydecyl acrylate, hydroxydecyl cyanoacrylate, hydroxycyclohexyl acrylate, hydroxycyclohexyl methacrylate, hycroxycyclooctyl acrylate, and the like. Those skilled in the art are fully familiar with this class of compounds and mixtures can be used. Illustrative of suitable vicinal alkylene oxides, one can mention ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, or mixtures thereof when mixtures are used they can be mixed at any proportions desired. The reaction between the hydroxyalkyl acrylates and alkylene oxide is preferably carried out in contact with a catalyst. The Lewis Acids are suitable as catalysts and illustrative thereof are boron trifluoride etherate, antimony trifluoride, stannic chloride, zinc chloride, as well as others known to those skilled in the art.The catalyst is present in a catalytically effective amount this can be from 0.1 to 1 weight percent, based on the total weight of reactants charged, preferably from 0.2 to 0.5 weight percent, with from 0.25 to 0.35 weight percent most preferred. In the reaction from 1 to about 80 moles, or more, preferably from 1 to 24 moles, of alkylene oxide are reacted per mole of hydroxyalkyl acrylate. The amount used is that required to give the desired average y value in formula I as previously indicated the preferred average y value is from 1 to 6 and the most preferred value is from 1 to 4. The reaction can be carried out at atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure pressure is not critical though modest pressure is generally used when reacting an alkylene oxide, as is known in the art. The reaction time will vary dependent upon the particular reactants, catalysts, temperature, and batch size involved in any particular instance. The reaction temperature will vary from about 200C to about 12500 and is generally from about 250C to about 800 C, preferably from about 550C to 750cm To minimize olefinic bond free radical polymerization an inhibitor such as the monomethyl ether of hydroquinone may be present at a concentration of from about 0.01 to 1 weight percent. Any of the other known inhibitors can be used. It has been noted, however, that the inhibitors will also slow down the alkylene oxide addition reaction therefore, when an inhibitor is used it should be employed at the lowest possible concentration. In carrying out the first step, the reaction of the alkylene oxide with the hydroxyalkyl acrylate one can charge the hydroxyalkyl acrylate and catalyst to a reactor equipped with stirring, condensing and cooling means and then the temperature of the contents is adjusted to the selected temperature. When this charge is at the desired temperature the alkylene oxide feed is startled and cooling is supplied as required to maintain the desired temperature during the exothermic feed period.After all of the alkylene oxide has been added, heating is continued for an additional period of time to assure completion of the reaction. The resulting adduct can be used in this form in the second step of the reaction, or it can be treated and the semi refined or refined adduct can then be used in the second step of the reaction. The alkylene oxide can be reacted to produce a random, block or capped adduct by the procedures known in the art. Any conventional refining procedure can be used when the adduct is desired in a purer state. Thus, following the additional heating period the residual adduct can be neutralized with a base or a diatomaceous earth material such as magnesium silicate, stirred, heated at reduced pressure to remove volatiles, and then filtered to remove solid residues. Other procedures can be used that are apparent to those skilled in the art. In the second step of the reaction the adduct whose preparation was described above is reacted with an organic isocyanate.. The suitable isocyanates can be mo no . di ,tri or tetra isocyanates and many such compounds are known and are commercially available. They can be used singly or in admixture and illustrative thereof one can mention methyl isocyanate, ethyl isocyanate, chloroethyl isocyanate, chloropropyl isocyanate, chlorohexyl isocyanate, chlorobutoxypropyl isocyanate, hexyl isocyanate, phenyl isocyanate, the o , m , and p chlorophenyl isocyanates, benzyl isocyanate, naphthyl isocyanate, o ethylphenyl isocyanate, the dichlorophenyl isocyanates, butyl isocyanate, n propyl isocyanate, octade cyl isocyanate, 3,5, 5 trimethyl 1 isocyanate 3 isocyana tomethylcyclohexane, di 2 isocyanatoethyl bicyclo 2.2.1 hept 5 ene 2, 3 di carboxylate, 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate, 2,6 tolylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, dianisidine diisocyanate, tolidine diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, the m and p xyl3rlene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, dicyclohexyl4,4 methane diisocyanate, cyclohexane 1 , 4 diisocyanate, 1 , 5 naphthylene diisocyanate, 4,4 diisocyanate diphenyl ether, 2,4,6 triisocyanato toluene, 4,4 ,4 triisocyanatotriphenyl methane, diphenylene 4,4 diisocyanate, the polymethylene polyphenylisocyanates, as well as any of the other organic isocyanates known to the average skilled chemist. It is customary to use any of the known urethaneforming reaction catalysts during the isocyanate reaction with the polyol. These are well known and any of the catalysts can be used. Illustrative thereof are dibutyltin dilaurate, stannous octoate, triethylenediamine, triethylamine, the known tin salt catalysts, and the like. They are generally employed at a concentration of from about 0.1 to 1 weight percent based onthe weight of the reaction mixture. The amount of isocyanate used is an amount to provide sufficient isocyanato equivalents to react with the reactive hydroxy equivalents on the adduct. It is customary to use a slight excess to assure complete reaction. As previously indicated when a monoisocyanate is employed the novel N substituted carbamoyloxy alkanoyloxyalkyl or aryl acrylate ester of formula I is monofunctional in respect to acrylyl functionality and when a polyisocyanate is used such formula I ester is polyfunctional in respect to acrylyl functionality. The term acrylyl includes acrylyl, methacrylyl and cyanoacrylyl groups. The second step of the reaction is generally carried out by slowly adding the isocyanate to the adduct obtained in the first step of the reaction at a temperature of from about 200 to 900C, preferably from about 250 to 750C, and most preferably from about 400 to 550cm During this addition the mixture is stirred thereafter stirring is continued at the selected reaction temperature for a short period of time to assure completion of reaction. The residual product is then vacuum stripped to remove volatiles and, if necessary filtered to remove any trace quantities of solid particles. TheN substituted carbamoyloxy alkylene oxyalkyl acrylate ester produced corresponding to formula I can be used per se or in formulated compositions useful as inks, coatings or adhesives. In producing formulated compositions the novel compounds of this invention are compounded with activators or catalysts, photoinitiators or photosensitizers, pigments or colorants, solvents, other reactive components, etc. The formulators skilled in the art of inks, coatings and adhesives are fully familiar with the requirements in their respective fields and with the components used in such formulations. Such components can be formulated with the novel compounds of this invention by the known and conventional procedures and in the accepted concentrations. Thus, when cure is to be accomplished by thermal means a conventional free radical catalyst or activator is used when the cure is to be achieved by particulate radiation such as electron beam radiation, an activator is usually not required when cure is to be effected by light radiation such as ultraviolet light, a photosensitizer or photoinitiator, with optionally an activator therefor, is needed to render the process commercially acceptable. Coating, ink or adhesive compositions can contain up to 100 weight percent, preferably from 25 to 95 weight percent of the noel compounds of this invention as the reactive component thereof.The specific identities of the other components referred to in this and the preceding paragraph are well known to those skilled in the art and require no further elaboration herein to enable such person to produce the formulations.
