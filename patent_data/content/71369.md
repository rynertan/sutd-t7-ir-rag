# Method and apparatus for controlling electric discharge machine.

## Abstract
A method of controlling an electric discharge machine wherein a motor 105 for moving an energized electrode EP relative to a workpiece is driven in accordance with command data. The method includes the steps of storing in memory retraction control information contained in the command data, moving the electrode EP in the advancing direction relative to the workpiece by controlling the speed of the motor 105 in accordance with machining feed speed information contained in the entered command data, moni toring the current position of the electrode EP by counting, via counting means 107 , pulses generated by a sensor 106 whenever the motor 105 rotates by a predetermined amount, moving the electrode EP in the retracting direction relative to the workpiece by reading in retraction speed from the retraction control information stored in the memory and controlling the speed of the motor 105 on the basis of the retraction speed, when a signal indicative of a short circuit is generated, and moving the electrode EP in the advancing direction relative to the workpiece by reading in a re advancing speed from the retraction control information stored in the memory, when a signal indicative of an end to the short circuit is generated.
