# MIXING MACHINES

## Abstract
A mixing machine comprising a mixing chamber and at least one rotor rotatable within the mixing chamber about a predetermined axis. The mixing chamber is defined by two end plates arranged generally perpendicular to the rotor axis and two or more wall elements located between the end plates. At least one of the wall elements is rotatable about an axis parallel to the rotor axis between a first position in which facing edges of the wall elements contact each other to define a longitudinal seal and a second position in which a discharge aperture is defined between the facing edges. The wall elements make sealing contact with the end plates when the rotatable wall element as in the first position to define circumferential seals, the seals being so positioned that any material leaking from them is in direct communication with the machine surroundings and can easily escape from the vicinity of the mixing chamber.
