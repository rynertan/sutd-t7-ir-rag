# Precursor for carbon containing monolithic glasses.

## Abstract
A valuable intermediate for the preparation of carbon containing monolithic glasses by solgel process is described which comprises a dispersion of a colloidal metal oxide or a mixture of colloidal metal oxide in a water alcohol solution of the partial condensate of a silanol having the formula RSi OH ₃ in which R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl radicals of 1 to 3 inclusive carbon atoms or the phenyl radical, or mixtures thereof. The composition contains 25 to 60 weight percent solids which themselves comprise 1 to 70 weight percent of colloidal oxide or mixtures thereof and 30 to 99 weight percent of the partial condensate. The metal oxides are selected from a group consisting essentially of i ZrO₂, ii SnO₂, iii ZrSiO₄, iv B₂O₃ and v La₂O₃.
