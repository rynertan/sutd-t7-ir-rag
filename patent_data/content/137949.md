# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a magnetic recording medium formed of a substrate and a layer of magnetic powder coated on a surface of the substrate, characterized in that the magnetic powder is hexagonal crystals having single domain crystal line magnetic anisotropy, particle sizes of 0.01 to 0.3 Âµm, particle size thickness ratios of 2.3 to 15 and the tapping packing rate of said magnetic powder is 15 or more.
