# Linear aromatic polyesters of enhanced hydrolytic stability, their preparation and shaped articles thereof.

## Abstract
Linear aromatic polyesters comprising monomer residues of a bisphenol and a dicarboxylic acid which posses enhanced hydrolytic stability are provided which contain terminal carboxylate ester groups derived from a saturated fluoro aliphatic alcohol of 1 to 45 carbon atoms. The saturated fluoro aliphatic alcohol can be incorporated in the linear polyesters either by reaction with a diacyl halide reactant before a polyesterification reaction or by mixing with a diacyl halide reactant and the bisphenol immediately before the polyesterification reaction.
