# Method and apparatus for internally coating welded pipe at the weldment.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is disclosed for fabricating an internally coated pipeline for transporting corrosive and or erosive materials in which the pipe sections are joined by welding. The pipe sections are first internally pre coated to the exclusion of a length at each end that is affected by the heat of welding the sections together. After the weld has been made between adjacent pipe sections, an expansible and retractable mold is positioned in the area of the weld joint to define an injection cavity between the pre coating ends. A coating material is injected into the cavity. The mold can then be retracted and moved to another weld joint where the process is repeated.
