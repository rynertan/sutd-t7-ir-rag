# Apparatus for manufacturing bidirectionally openable slide fasteners.

## Abstract
An apparatus for automatically manufacturing a bidirectionally openable slide fastener 21 or 22 includes a pin attachment unit A for attaching a pin 27 to an end of one of a pair of slide fastener stringers 25, 26 , a pair of first and second slider attachment units B, C for attaching first and second sliders 23, 24 , respectively, to the stringers 25, 26 , and a box pin attachment unit D for attaching a box pin 28 to an end of the other slide fastener stringer. The slide fastener stringers 25, 26 are fed by a gripper mechanism F along a feed path as the pin 27 , the sliders 23, 24 , and the box pin 28 are successively attached to the slide fastener stringers 25, 26 . Finally, the slide fastener stringers 25, 26 are cut off by a cutter unit E into a bidirectionally openable slide fastener 21 or 22 of a desired length.
