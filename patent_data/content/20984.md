# Ink jet printing system and method of generating liquid droplets.

## Abstract
A drop on demand ink jet printer in which the print head 10 includes a cavity 14 having a nozzle portion 20 at one end and a transducer 24 mounted to contract a wall portion of the cavity when energized by a suitable voltage drive pulse from control means 26. The drive pulses are produced at a predetermined rate but at a selectively controlled amplitude in response to the print data. In cases where no drop is required to print the data, the drive pulse is at a lower amplitude than a threshold voltage level, and for the first drop to be formed following a time at which no drop was formed, the amplitude of the drive pulse is greater than the threshold voltage level. At steady state operation of producing drops in sequence, the amplitude of the drive pulse equals the threshold voltage level.
