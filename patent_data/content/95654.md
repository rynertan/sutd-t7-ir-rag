# Method of manufacturing semiconductor device, including a step of patterning a conductor layer.

## Abstract
A conductor layer 29 is formed on an insulating film 24, 26 which is formed on a semiconductor substrate 21 and which consists of a thick portion 24 and a thin portion 26 with a step therebetween. A film 30 made of material having an etch rate substantially equal to that of the material of the conductor layer 29 is formed on the layer 29 . The film 30 , which has a substantially flat upper surface, and the conductor layer 29 form a laminated structure. Those portions of the laminated structure which are on the thin portion 26 of the insulating film and said step have sub stantially the same thickness. A mask layer 31 of a predetermined pattern is formed on the laminated structure 29, 30 . Using the mask layer 31 , the laminated structure 29, 30 is selectively etched, the selected portions of the conductor layer 29 and film 30 being etched at the same etching rate. Thereafter, the mask layer 31 and the remain ing film 30 are removed.
