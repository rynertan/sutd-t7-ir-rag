# Process for the decomposition of water.

## Abstract
Process for decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen by 1 reacting hydrogen sulfide with cuprous sulfide to produce said hydrogen and cupric sulfide according to the equation H₂S Cu₂S H₂ 2CuS 2 decomposing said cupric sulfide to produce said cuprous sulfide and sulfur according to the equation 2CuS Cu₂S S 3 reacting said sulfur with water to produce said hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide according to the equation 3S 2H₂O 2H₂S SO₂ 4 reacting said sulfur dioxide with water to produce sulfur and sulfuric acid according to the equation 3SO₂ 2H₂O S 2H₂SO₄ and 5 decomposing said sulfuric acid to produce said sulfur dioxide, water, and said oxygen according to the equation 2H₂SO₄ 2SO₂ O₂ 2H₂O. This process utilizes lower temperatures and is more thermally efficient than prior thermal processes.
