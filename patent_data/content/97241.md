# CR DOPED YTTRIUM GALLIUM GARNET LASER

## Abstract
A broadly wavelength tunable laser is provided which comprises as the laser medium a single crystal of YGG CrÂ³ . The laser may be operated over a broad temperature range from cryogenic temperatures to elevated temperatures. Emission is in a spectral range from red to infrared, and the laser is useful in the fields of defense, communications, isotope separation, photochemistry, etc.
