# Basic sediment and water measurement in crude oil streams.

## Abstract
Capacitance cells comprising concentric tubes are maintained clean of sediment in the space betweeen the inner and outer tubes where capacitance is measured by 1 suspending fibrous strands in the fluid flow outside the inner tube and or 2 partially plugging the inner tube to increase flow oustide the inner tube.
