# STRIPPER SYSTEM FOR SURFACES

## Abstract
A stripper system comprises a stripper composition for treating a surface so as to give removable treatment product for stripping at least a portion of said surface, said composi tion comprising at least one component chosen from alkali metal oxides, alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbon ates, alkali earth metal oxides, alkali earth metal hydroxides, and alkali earth metal carbonates and cover means for covering said composition at least a portion of time said composition treats said surface, said cover means being adapted to remove at least a portion of said treatment product when said cover means is moved in at least one direction appropriate for that removal. Preferably, the strip per composition includes sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide. Preferably, the cover means is an endless fibre fabric comprising polypropylene fibre and having a pile. The stripper system can be embodied for different applications, e.g. for stripping coatings of cured faint and or of cured varnish.
