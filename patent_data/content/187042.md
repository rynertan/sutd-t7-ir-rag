## Description
The present invention relates to an apparatus for operating a plurality of cycloconverters in a parallel fashion. A cycloconverter is an apparatus to directly convert an ac power having a fixed frequency into an ac power having a different frequency. Such a cycloconverter has been widely used for a variable voltage variable frequency power supply for driving an ac motor. Particularly, it has been known that a cycloconverter of the circulating current type can set the upper limit of an output frequency f₀ at a high value an operation is possible at an output frequency about an input frequency f₁ as disclosed in the Japanese Patent Publication Tokkaisho No. 60 28772, and the range of applications has been increasingly extended. To overcome such drawbacks, a system described in the Japanese Patent Publication No. 59 14988 is proposed to connect a power factor compensating capacitor at the receiving end of a cycloconverter to effect a control such that a lapping reactive power of the cycloconverter and a leading reactive power of the power compensating capacitor are cancelled with each other, thus allowing a power factor of a fundamental wave viewed from a power supply to be always unity. However, various drawbacks have been pointed out in the art in regard of apparatus provided with such a power factor compensating capacitor, or in regard of the relationship between the power factor compensating capacitor and the cycloconverter as understood from the following description. US 4,418,380 is directed to a method for controlling one three phase cycloconverter, in which the circulating current command values are applied to the cycloconverter to control the three phases thereof. The object of the apparatus disclosed in this document is to provide means for reducing the maximum current of the converter. Furthermore, the circulating current command values are determined in response to the instantaneous values of the respective phase load currents. Hence, the power factor compensating capacitor must have a capacity sufficient to cancel the reactive power when the cycloconverter has a maximum load. With the above in view, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for operating cycloconverters in a parallel fashion, which makes it possible to reduce the capacity of a power factor compensating capacitor to be connected at a receiving end, to improve an operating efficiency at the time of a light load operation, to maintain the characteristics of a cycloconverter of the circulating current type at the time of an overload operation, and to reduce the capacity of the cycloconverter. To achieve this object there is provided an apparatus for operating cycloconverters in a parallel fashion comprising a an ac power supply b a plurality of circulating current type cycloconverters CC₁, CC₂,.... CC Thus, a reactive power of the entirety of the apparatus may be controlled. It is essential to provide for an optimum value as the capacity of a power factor compensating capacitor in consideration of the overall operating mode. Thus, this allows the capacity of the power factor compensating capacitor to be reduced and eliminates the possibility that no unnecessary circulating current flows in the entire system, enabling an operation with a high efficiency. Where a sum of lagging reactive powers of the entirety of the cycloconverters exceeds the capacity of the power factor compensating capacitor due to an overload operation, a control is effected to maintain circulating current command values delivered to the respective cycloconverters at a fixed value unequal to zero, thereby making it possible to operate the respective cycloconverters in a manner that they do not lose the characteristics of the cycloconverter or the circulating current type. Further, where circulating currents which are to flow in the respective cycloconverters in a light load operation, a control is effected to reduce the number of power factor compensating capacitors connected depending upon the magnitude of the circulating current command value, thus making it possible to Perform an improvement in operating efficiency. In addition, where respective cycloconverters are operated in accordance with different operating modes e.g., light load or overload operating mode, etc., a distributive control is effected to flow a large circulating current in a cycloconverter coupled to the light load and to flow a small circulating current, thus making it possible to prevent the current capacity of the converters from being increased. In the drawings, Initially, drawbacks with the prior art will be described with reference to Fig. 15, and then preferred embodiments according to the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 14. Referring to Fig. 15, there is shown an example of a conventional apparatus for operating a plurality of cycloconverters in a parallel fashion. The parallel operating apparatus shown includes a power supply line BUS of a three phase ac power supply, main switches SW The load current control circuit ALR The circulating current control circuit ACR At the receiving end of the cycloconverter CC A, the power factor compensating capacitor CAP A is connected. The detection of a reactive current component I The cycloconverter CC B is configured in the same manner as the cycloconverter CC A to control a circulating current I The drawbacks with such a conventional apparatus for operating cycloconverters in a parallel fashion are as follows. Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown an embodiment of an apparatus for operating cycloconverters in a parallel fashion according to the present invention. The apparatus shown includes a power supply line BUS of a three phase ac power supply, a power factor compensating capacitor CAP, power transformers T A control circuit for the apparatus comprises a three phase current detector CT, a three phase voltage detector PT, a reactive power computing circuit VAR, a total reactive power control circuit TQC, load current control circuits I Initially, the normal operation of the cycloconverter CC₁ will be described. Referring to Fig. 2, there is shown an embodiment of a three phase output cycloconverter. The system shown includes power transformers TrU, TrV and TrW, U , V and W phase cycloconverters of the circulating current type CC U, CC V and CC W, respectively, armature windings of the motor M₁ shown in Fig. 1 L The U phase cycloconverter CC U comprises a positive group converter SSP, a negative group converter SSN, and reactors L₀₁ and L₀₂ with intermediate taps. A control circuit CC U for the U phase cycloconverter CC U comprises a load current detector CT The V phase and W phase cycloconverters are configured in the same manner as the V phase cycloconverter. Further, control circuits CONT V and CONT W encircled by single dotted lines are configures in the same manner as the control circuit CONT U. The operation of a load current control of the cycloconverter of the circulating current type will be described by taking the case of U phase. A load current command I Load currents I Subsequently, the control operation of the circulating current I The circulating current I The circulating current I Accordingly, inputs ε₄ and ε₅ to the phase control circuits PHP and PHN are respectively expressed as follows Accordingly, the relationship of When the circulating current I Circulating currents I Ordinarily, the above mentioned circulating current command values I The elementary operation of the cycloconverter CC₁ shown in Fig. 1 has been described. Other cycloconverters operates in the same manner. An operation of a reactive power control at the receiving end of the apparatus shown in Fig. 1 is now referred to. Fig. 3 shows an embodiment of the total reactive power control circuit TQC provided in the apparatus shown in Fig. 1. The circuit shown comprises a comparator C₁, a control compensation circuit H First is to detect a reactive power Q In the circuit shown in Fig. 3, the above mentioned value detected of the reactive power Q Assuming now that the operational amplifiers G₁ to G To obtain the circulating current command value I₀₁ of the cycloconverter CC₁, an output signal of the operational amplifier G₁ is input to the adder AD₁ through the limitter circuit LM₁. The limitter circuit LM₁ has a characteristic as shown in Fig. 4. Namely, where an input signal e Further, the output e Circulating current command values I Where the value detected the sign of lag is positive of the reactive power at the receiving end is smaller than its command value Q When the circulating current of each cycloconverter increases, a lagging reactive power Q In contrast, when Q Where the error ε₁ increases in a negative direction, the output of the control compensating circuit H Accordingly, the following relationship holds in connection with circulating current command values of respective cycloconverters, Fig. 5 shows an output voltage waveform of a cycloconverter of the circulating current type having 12 control phases when the setting is made such that an output frequency f₀ is 1.2 times larger than an input frequency f The output voltage V Namely, the normal operating mode of the cycloconverter of the circulating current type is to operate both the positive group converter SSP and the negative converter SSN at the same time. Accordingly, if an operating mode is employed to activate only one of them, viz., to allow the circulating current to be zero, there will be invited an inconvenience such that the cycloconverter has a sawtooth output waveform due to either of the positive and negative group converters, with the result that many harmonics are included. Accordingly, the cycloconverter of the circulating current type has employed an operating mode such that the circulating current simply flows therein. Fig. 6 shows an example of an operating mode of the system shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 6a, Q When Q In contrast, when Accordingly, where the overload operation stated above frequently occurs, it is necessary to provide for a power factor compensating capacitor CAP sufficient to cope with the overload operation. However, in general, there are many cases where the cycloconverter system is operated for a long time under a load condition below the rated load and an overload operation is required. Especially, where a plurality of cycloconverters are operated in a parallel fashion, there is little possibility that the necessity of the overload operation occurs at the same time. As previously described, when Q It is very seldom that all cycloconverters are operated under overload condition at the same time. Q In contrast, the system according to the present invention can determine the capacity of the power factor compensating capacitor taking into account the total operating mode of the entirety of the cycloconverters. Accordingly, it is sufficient to provide for a minimum value required as the power factor compensating capacitor, with the result that a considerably reducing effect will be expected. Even in the case where the value of Q Fig. 7 is a block diagram illustrating another embodiment of an apparatus for operating a plurality of cycloconverters in a parallel fashion. The apparatus shown comprises a power supply line of a three phase power supply, a power factor compensating capacitor CAP, main switches SW Initially, the operation of the cycloconverter CC A of the circulating current type will be described. Fig. 8 is a block diagram illustarting an example of a main circuit of the circulating current type cycloconverter CC A and the ac motor M Fig. 9 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a control circuit for cycloconverter. The control circuit shown comprises a limitter circuit L1M, adders AD₁ to AD₉, comparators C₁ to C₆, circulating current control compensative circuits G The operation of the cycloconverter CC A will be described with reference to Figs. 8 and 9. The cycloconverter CC A, which is an apparatus to directly convert a three phase ac into a three phase ac having a different frequency, is divided into the U phase cycloconverter CC U, the V phase cycloconverter CC V and the W phase cycloconverter CC W. The operation of a load current control and a circulating current control carried out in the U phase cycloconverter will be first described. A control of a load current I The positive group converter SSP produces a voltage V Assuming now that an output signal from the circulating current control circuit is sufficiently small, it is expressed as follows Namely, where the positive group converter SSP produces a positive voltage V Accordingly, a voltage expressed below is applied to the load U, When I By changing sinusoidally the load current command value I Then, the operation of a circulating current control of the U phase cycloconverter will be described. First is to detect an output current I The circulating current I Accordingly, inputs v Accordingly, the relationship of When I Load currents I The operation of a reactive power control of the system shown in Fig. 7 will be described. First is to detect a reactive power Q The value detected of the reactive power Q To the cycloconverter CC A, the circulating current command I The output of the limiter circuit LIM is input to the adders AD₃, AD₆ and AD₉, in which minimum circulating current command values I To the U and W phase cycloconverters, similar circulating current command values I Where the value detected which is positive in the case of lag of a reactive power at the receiving end is smaller than its command value Q When the circulating current of the cycloconverter increases, the lagging reactive power Q In contrast, when Q Where the error ε However, an output I Fig. 11 is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of the distribution circuit DST provided in the system shown in Fig. 7. The distribution circuit DST comprises absolute value circuits ABS, to ABS₄, operational amplifiers OA₁ to OA₄, adder subtractor circuits A₁ to A₄, multipliers ML₁ to ML₄, and analog switch circuits AS₁ to AS₄. The output I The circulating current command I The peak value I The output thus obtained of the adder substactor circuit A₁ is input to the multiplier ML₁, and then is multiplied by the output signal I is set at the maximum value of the peak value I Further, circulating current commands I Accordingly, e.g. in the case where the cycloconverter CC A operates under a light load condition and other cycloconverters operate under heavy load conditions, the absolute value I respectively. As a result, circulating current commands I Namely, by flowing much circulating current in a cycloconverter under a light load condition and by flowing less circulating current in respective cycloconverters under heavy load conditions, a control of the total reactive power Q Analog switches AS₁ to AS₄ are provided for individually setting the respective circulating current commands I Figure 12 is a schematic view showing an example of a power factor compensating capacitor CAP connected at a receiving end wherein the capacitor CAP is divided into three phase distributed capacitors CAP₁, CAP₂, ... corresponding to a large number of stages. By operating switches MC₁, MC₂, ... provided in the respective stages, the number of distributed capacitor connected can be switched. Fig. 13 is a block diagram illustrating an example of a switching control circuit for controlling the switches MC₁, MC₂, ... shown in Fig. 12. The switching control circuit comprises a hysteresis circuit HYS, monostable multivibrator circuits which will be referred hereinafter as monomulti MM₁ and MM₂, an up down counter CN, and a select or circuit SELECT. The output signal I In contrast, where the cycloconverter is operated under a heavy load condition, with the result that the output signal I Fig. 14 shows the relationship between a counted value of the counter CN and the number of the switches MC₁ to MC₄ closed where the power factor compensating capacitor CAP is divided into four stages. By controlling the number of the distributed capacitors connected of the power factor compensating capacitor CAP depending upon the magnitude of the circulating current command value I It is needless to say that the present invention can be practiced by using circulating current type cycloconverters delta connected as disclosed in the Japanese Patent Publication No. 58 60328. The total reactive power control circuit TQC shown in Fig. 3 is configured that the operational amplifiers G₁, G₂, ... G Further, it is needless to say that the operating system according to the present invention can be operated in the same manner even if a non circulating current type cycloconverter is included in a plurality of cycloconverters. As stated above, the following advantages with the system according to the present invention can be expected.
