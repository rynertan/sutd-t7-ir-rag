## Description
NOVEL DERIVATIVES OF GUANINE IDESCRIPTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to novel derivatives of guanine, methods for their preparation, novel pharmaceutical compositions and use of said compounds in the treatment of virus infections, such as herpes virus infections, which can cause various diseases in an animal or human host, including both common infections and neoplastic diseases, i.e. cancer.Background of the InventionThe effects of viruses on bodily functions is the end result of changes occurring at the cellular and subcellular levels. The pathogenic changes at the cellular level are different for different combinations of viruses and host cells. While some viruses cause a general destruction killing of certain cells, other may transform cells to a neoplastic state.Important common viral infections are herpes dermatitis including herpes labialis , herpes keratitis, herpes genitalis, herpes zoster, herpes encephalitis, infections mononucleosis and cytomegalovirus infections all of which are caused by viruses belonging to the herpesvirus group. Other important viral diseases are influenza A and B which are caused by influenza A and B virus respectively. Another important common viral disease is viral hepatitis and especially hepatitis B virus infections are widely spread. Effective and selective antiviral agents are needed for the treatment of these diseases as well as for other diseases caused by viruses. Several different viruses of both DNA and RNA type have been shown to cause tumors in animals. The effect of cancerogenic chemicals can on animals result in activation of latent tumor viruses. It is possible that tumor viruses are involved in human tumors. The most likely human cases known today are leucemias, sarcomas, breast carcinomas, Burkitt lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinomas and cervical cancers where RNA tumor viruses and herpes viruses are indicated. This makes the search for selective inhibitors of tumorogenic viruses and their functions an important undertaking in the efforts to treat cancer.Prior Art The compound 9 4 hydroxybutyl guanine is disclosed in Chem. Pharm.Bull. 17 1969 1268 1270 and in Agr. Biol.

They will normally be administered topically, orally, intranasally, by injection or by inhalation in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the active ingredient in the form of the original compound or optionally in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which may be a solid, semi solid or liquid diluent or an ingestible capsule, and such compositions comprise a further aspect of the invention. The compound may also be used without carrier material. As examples of pharmaceutical compositions may be mentioned tablets, drops, such as nasal drops, eye drops, preparations for topical application such as ointments, jellies, creams and suspensions, aerosols for inhalation, nasal spray, liposomes etc.Usually the active substance will comprise between 0.01 and 99, or between 0.1 and 99 by weight of the composition, for example between 0.5 and 20 for compositions intended for injection and between 0.1 and 50 for compositions intended for oral administration. The compositions are preferably in dosage unit form. Further, they are preferably provided in sterilized form.To produce pharmaceutical compositions in the form of dosage units for oral application containing a compound of the invention the active ingredient may be mixed with a solid, pulverulent carrier, for example lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, a starch such as potato starch, corn starch, amylopectin, laminaria powder or citrus pulp powder, a cellulose derivative or gelatine and also may include lubricants such as magnesium or calcium stearate or a Carbowaxe or other polyethylene glycol waxes and compressed to form tablets or cores for drawees. If drags are required, the cores may be coated for example with concentrated sugar solutions which may contain gum arabic, talc and or titianium dioxide, or alternatively with a film forming agent dissolved in easily volatile organic solvents or mixtures of organic solvents.Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings, for example, to distinguish between different contents of active substance. For the preparation of soft gelatine capsules consisting of gelatine and, for example, glycerol and a plasticizer, or similar closed capsules, the active substance may be admixed with a CarbowaxX or a suitable oil as e.g.sesame oil, olive oil, or arachis oil. Hard gelatine capsules may contain granulates of the active substance with solid, pulverulent carriers such as lactose, saccharose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches for example potato starch, corn starch or amylopectin , cellulose derivatives or gelatine, and may also include magnesium stearate or stearic acid as lubricants.By using several layers of the active drug, separated by slowly dissolving coatings sustained release tablets are obtained. Another way of preparing sustained release tablets is to divide the dose of the active drug into granules with coatings of different thicknesses and compress the granules into tablets together with the carrier substance.The active substance can also be incorporated in slowly dissolving tablets made for instance of fat and wax substances or evenly distributed in a tablet of an insoluble substance such as a physiologically inert plastic substance. Liquid compositions for oral application may be in the form of elixirs, syrups or suspensions, for example solutions containing from about 0.1 to 20 by weight of active substance, sugar and a mixture of ethanol, water, glycerol, propylene glycol and optionally aroma, saccharine and or carboxymethylcellulose as a dispersing agent.For parenteral application by injection compositions may comprise an aqueous solution of the active drug or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, desirably in a concentration of 0.05 10 , and optionally also a stabilizing agent and or buffer substances in aqueous solution.Dosage units of the solution may advantageously be enclosed in ampoules.For topical application, especially for the treatment of herpesvirus infections on skin, genitals and in mouth and eyes the compositions are suitably in the form of a solution, ointment, gel, suspension, cream or the like. The amount of active substance may vary, for example between 0.05 20 by weight of the active substance. Such compositions for topical application may be prepared in known manner by mixing the active substance with known carrier materials such as isopropanol, glycerol, paraffin, stearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, etc. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may also include a known chemical absorption promoter. Examples of absorption promoters are e.g. dimethylacetamide US 3,472,931, trichloroethanol or trifluoroethanol US 3,891,757 , certain alcohols and mixtures thereof GB 1,001,949 . The dosage at which the active ingredients are administered may vary within a wide range and will depend on various factors such as for example the severity of the infection, the age of the patient, etc., and may have to be individually adjusted. As a possible range for the amount of the compounds of the invention which may be administered per day may be mentioned from about 0.1 mg to about 2000 mg or from about 1 mg to about 2000 mg, or preferably from 1 mg to about 2000 mg for topical administration, from 50 mg to about 2000 mg or from 100 to about 1000 mg for oral administration and from 10 mg to about 2000 mg or from 50 to about 500 mg for injection. In severe cases it may be necessary to increase these doses 5 fold to 10 fold. In less severe cases it may be sufficient to use up to 500 or 1000 mg.The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredients may suitably be formulated so that they provide doses within these ranges either as single dosage units or as multiple dosage units.Thus, it has been found according to the invention that the compounds of the formula I and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof can be used to inhibit herpesvirus multiplication. The compounds of the formula I and physiologically acceptable salts thereof are useful in therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment of virus infections.A preferred aspect of the invention is the use of the compounds of the formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, in the treatment of herpesvirus infections.
