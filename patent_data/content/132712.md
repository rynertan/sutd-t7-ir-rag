# COAL AQUEOUS SLURRY

## Abstract
Coal aqueous slurries having improved shear stability and lower viscosity are described. The use of a plurality of surfactants each having hydrophilic portions with each sur factant hydrophilic portion having a different molecular weight are utilized in sufficient amounts to wet and disperse particulate coal and water. When two surfactants are utilized, coal aqueous mixtures may be formulated having up to or over 70 by weight coal when the first surfactant has a hyd rophilic portion comprising a relatively large number of ethylene oxide units and the second surfactant has hyd rophilic portion comprising a relatively small number of ethylene oxide units.
