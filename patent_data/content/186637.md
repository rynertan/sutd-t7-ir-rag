# Marine anti fouling coating formulations containing a soluble phase including a organotin polymer in combination with an insoluble phase including a crosslinked organotin polymer.

## Abstract
A coating composition for marine structures containing a soluble acrylic organotin polymer and a soluble metal free acrylic polymer, in combination with an insoluble crosslink ed organotin polymer, and an insoluble filler in a coating composition solvent can provide a tough, durable flexible coating and can provide extended protection to marine structures from the growth or accumulation of marine organisms.
