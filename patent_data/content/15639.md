## Description
ENANTIOMERS OF TRIAZOLE COMPOUNDS, A PROCESS FOR PREPARING THEM, THEIR USE AS PLANT FUNGICIDES AND GROWTH REGULATING AGENTS AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to enantiomers of certain triazole derivatives, to a process for obtaining these enantiomers, to fungicidal and plant growth regulating compositions containing them, to a method of combating fungal infections in, regulating the growth of plants using them. British Patent Application No. 34590 76 which corresponds to Dutch Patent Application No. 77019197 the disclosure of which Applications is incorporated herein by reference , discloses inter alia compounds of general formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1 is benzyl optionally ring substituted with up to three substituents selected from the class consisting of halogen, alkyl and alkoxy, and R2 is C16 alkyl, and their esters, acid addition salts and metal complexes.The compounds are stated to have plant fungicidal and plant growth regulating activities. It will be appreciated that these compounds contain two chiral centres. This means that the compounds can exist in four optical isomeric forms. Two of these isomers are enantiomers i.e. mirror images of each other, as are the other two isomers. One pair of enantiomers are diastereoisomers of the other pair of enantiomers. Using the conventional nomenclature system for enantiomers having known absolute configurations, the four enantiomers can be designated as R C2 .R C1 b s c2 S C1 c ,R c2 S C1 d S C2 CR C1 Isomers a and b are enantiomers of each other and they are diastereoisomers of isomers c and d which are also enantiomers of each other. British Patent Application No. 34590 76 discloses the diastereoisomers of the compound wherein R1 is parachlorobenzyl and R2 is t butyl see Compounds 1 and 5 of Table I in British Application No. 34590 76. Compound 1 is a racemic mixture of an enantiomer wherein both the carbon carrying the triazole ring and the carbon carrying the hydroxy are in the R configuration, whileCompound 5 is a racemic mixture of an enantiomer wherein the carbon carrying the triazole ring is in the Rconfiguration and the carbon carrying the hydroxy group is in the S configuration and an enantiomer which is its mirror image in fact, Compound 1 is a racemic mixture of enantiomers a and b and compound 5 is a racemic mixture of enantiomers c and d .Compounds 1 and 5 were found.to have approximately the same activities as plant fungicides and plant growth regulating agents, but compound 1 is generally more active than compound 5. We have now found that when the two enantiomers of a diastereoisomeric mixture of this type are separated there can be a significant separation of the fungicidal and plant growth regulating activities between the two enantiomers. For example, we have resolved compound 1 which is a racemic mixture into its enantiomers and have found that one of them, the enantiomer, which is now known from X ray analysis to be enantiomer a , has high fungicidal activity but low plant growth regulating activity.The other isomer, the enantiomer which is enantiomer buzz has not yet been obtained completely optically pure however, testing of an optically slightly impure sample has suggested that it may have lower fungicidal activity but higher plant growth regulating activity than the racemic mixture and the enantiomer. Further, compound 9 which is also a racemic mixture has been resolved into its enantiomers and we have found that one of them, the enantiomer which is enantiomer a J , has higher fungicidal but lower plant growth regulating activity than the racemic mixture in addition, the . enantiomer, unlike the racemic mixture, is volatile enough to be active in the vapour phase against fungi on the plants. The invention therefore provides a compound which is an enantiomer of a compound of general formula I or an ester, acid addition salt or metal complex of such an enantiomer, the enantiomer being substantially optically pure i.e. it is associated with no more than 10 of the other enantiomers . The optical purity of an enantiomer can be established by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques using a chiral shift reagent.

Each of Compounds 1 and 9 is a racemic mixture of an enantiomer wherein both the carbon carrying the triazole ring and the carbon carrying the hydroxy group are in the R configuration and an enantiomer which is its mirror image.Each ofCompounds 5 and 36 is a racemic mixture of an enantiomer wherein the carbon carrying the triazole ring is in theR configuration and the carbon carrying the hydroxy group is in the S configuration and an enantiomer which is its mirror image. Compound 16 is in the form of a copper complex believed to have the structureEMI12.1 Nuclear magnetic resonance studies have shown thatCompounds 17, 19 and 20 are each in the form of a mixture of diastereoisomers. The weight ratios of the two diastereoisomers in each case. are as follows Compound Weight ratio 17 9 1 19 7 1 20 4 1 x Compound 4 is the acetate of Compound 1 andCompound 55 is the acetate of Compound 9. There now follows a discussion of the preparation the diastereoisomeric mixtures suitable for resolution into enantiomers. The racemic mixtures of isomers 1 and 2 of the compound of general formula I , or a salt thereof, can be prepared by reducing, preferably at O to 1000C and for 1 to 12 hours, a compound of general formula it EMI13.1 wherein Y, R1 and R2 are as defined above, or a salt thereof. Suitable reducing agents are sodium borohydride, lithium aluminium hydride or aluminium isopropoxide. If desired, catalytic hydrogenation using a suitable metal catalyst can be used. When the compound of general formula II is a sterically hindered ketone, a Grignard reagent, for example butylmagnesium halide e.g. bromide or iodide can be used as the reducing agent when a reagent such as a butyl magnesium halide is used, single diastereoisomers are often produced. The reduction can be performed by dissolving the reactants in a solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran for lithium aluminium hydride reduction or hydroxylic solvents for sodium borohydride reduction .The reaction temperature will depend on the reactants and solvent but generally the reaction mexture is heated under reflux. After the reaction, the product can be isolated by extraction into a convenient solvent after acidification with dilute mineral acid. On removal of the solvent in vacuo, the product may be crystallised from a convenient solvent. The racemic mixture of isomers 3 and 4 of the compound of general formula I , or a salt thereof, can be prepared by reacting, preferably at 15 to 800C and for 6 to 12 hours, a compound of general formula II or a salt thereof with the appropriate Grignard reagent e.g. a methyl or alkenyl magnesium halide such as methyl or allyl magnesium bromide or iodide. This reaction can be performed by methods known in the art. Details of the preparation of the compounds of general formula II can be found in British PatentApplication No. 34590 76. The salts, metal complexes and esters of the compounds of general formula I can be prepared from the latter in known manner. For example, the complexes can be made by reacting the uncomplexed compound with a metal salt in a suitable solvent. Further, the substituent on the ring of the benzyl in the compound of general formula I can be changed by methods known in the art. As indicated above the compounds of general formula I are prepared by the above reactions in the form of racemic mixtures. The resolution of these mixtures into the constituent enantiomers can be performed by known methods. Examples of these methods are 1 forming the diastereoisomeric salts or esters of the compound of general formula I with an optically active acid e.g.camphor sulphonic acid , separating the isomeric salts or esters and converting the separated isomeric salts or esters into the enantiomers of the compound of general formula I 2 forming the diastereoisomeric carbamates of the compound of general formula I by reacting a haloformate e.g. chloroformate of the latter with an optically active amine e.g. ci methylbenzylamine , separating the isomeric carbamates, and converting the separated isomeric carbamates into the enantiomers of the compound of general formula I or 3 resolving the mixtures using enantioselective crystallisation techniques Leigh, Chemistry and Industry, 1970, pages 1016 1017, and ibid, 1977, page 36 . The separation of the diastereoisomeric salts, esters and carbamates can be achieved by for example crystallisation techniques or by high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC .Alternatively, the enantiomers can be prepared directly from the compound of general formula II by stereospecific reduction, for example by biochemical reduction using for example yeast or Aspergillus niger or by hydrogenation using chiral catalysts e.g. a Wilkinson s catalyst or by reduction with borohydride amino acid complexes. The enantiomer compounds of the invention and their esters, salts and metal complexes hereinafter referred to as the compounds can have fungicidal activity particularly against the diseases Piricularia oryzae on ricePuccinia recondita, Puccinia striformis and other rusts on wheat, Puccinia hordei, Puccinia striiformis and other rusts on barley, and rusts on other hosts e.g.coffee, apples, vegetables and ornamental plantsPlasmopara viticola on vinesErysiphe graminis powdery mildew on barley and wheat and other powdery mildews on various hosts such asSphaerotheca fuliginea on cucurbits e.g. cucumber ,Podosphaera leucotricha on apples and Uncinula necator on vinesHelminthosporium spp. on cerealsCercospora arachidicola on peanuts and other Cercospora species on for example sugar beet, bananas and soya beansBotrytis cinerea grey mould on tomatoes, strawberries, vines and other hostsPhytophthora infestans late blight on tomatoesVenturia inaequalis scab on apples Some of the compounds have also shown a broad range of activities against fungi in vitro. They have activity against various post harvest diseases on fruit e.g.Penicillium digatatum and italicum on oranges andGloeosporium musarum on bananas . Further some of the compounds are active as seed dressings against Fusarium spp., Septoria spp., Tilletia spp. i.e. bunt, a seed borne disease of wheat , Ustilago spp., Helminthosporium spp. on cereals, Rhizoctonia solani on cotton andCorticium sasakii on rice. The compounds can also have plant growth regulating activities. The plant growth regulating effects of the compounds are manifested as for example a stunting or dwarfing effect on the vegetative growth df woody and herbaceous mono and di cotyledonous plants. Such stunting or dwarfing may be useful, for example, in peanuts, cereals and soya bean where reduction in stem growth may reduce the risk of lodging and may also permit increased amounts of fertiliser to be applied. The stunting of woody species is useful in controlling the growth of undergrowth under power lines etc. Compounds which induce stunting or dwarfing may also be useful in modifying the stem growth of sugar cane thereby increasing the concentration of sugar in the cane at harvest in sugar cane, the flowering and ripening may be controllable by applying the compounds. Stunting of peanuts can assist in harvesting.Growth retardation of grasses can help maintenance of grass swards. Examples of suitable grasses are Stenotaphrum secundatum St. Augustine grass , Cynosurus cristatus, Lolium multiflorum and perenne, Agrostis tenuis, Cynodon dactylon Bermuda grass , Dactylis glomerata, Festuca spp. e.g. Festuca rubra and Poa spp. e.g. Poa pratense . The compounds may stunt grasses without significant phytotoxic effects and without deleteriously affecting the appearance particularly the colour of the grass this makes such compounds attractive for use on ornamental lawns and on grass verges. They may also have an effect on flower head emergence in for example grasses. The compounds can also stunt weed species present in the grasses examples of such weed species are sedges e.g. Cyperus spp. and dicotyledonous weeds e.g. daisy, plantain, knotweed, speedwell, thistle, docks and ragwort .The growth of non crop vegetation e.g. weeds or cover vegetation can be retarded thus assisting in the maintenance of plantation and field crops. In fruit orchards, particularly orchards subject te soil erosion, the presence of grass cover is important.. However excessive grass growth requires substantial maintenance. The compounds of the invention could be useful in this situation as they could restrict growth without killing the plants which would lead to soil erosion at the same time the degree of competition for nutrients and water by the grass would be reduced and this could result in an increased yield of fruit. In some cases, one grass species may be stunted more than another grass species this selectivity could be useful for example for improving the quality of a sward by preferential suppression of the growth of undesirable species. The dwarfing may also be useful in miniaturising ornamental, household, garden and nursery plants e.g.poinsettias, chrysanthemums, carnations, tulips and daffodils . As indicated above, the compounds can also be used to stunt woody species. This property can be used to control hedgerows or to shape fruit trees e.g. apples . Some coniferous trees are not significantly stunted by the compounds so the compounds could be useful in controlling undesirable vegetation in conifer nurseries. The plant growth regulating effect may as implied above manifest itself in an increase in crop yield. In the potato, vine control in the field and inhibition of sprouting in the store may be possible. Other plant growth regulating effects caused by the compounds include alteration of leaf angle and promotion of tillering in monocotyledonous plants. The former effect may be useful for example in altering the leaf orientation of, for example, potato crops thereby letting more light into the crops and inducing an increase in phytosynthesis and tuber weight. By increasing tillering in monocotyledonous crops e.g. rice , the number of flowering shoots per unit area may be increased thereby increasing the overall grain yield ofsuch crops. In grass swards an increase in tillering could lead to a denser sward which.may result in increased.resilience in wear. The treatment of plants with the compounds can lead to the leaves developing a darker green colour. The compounds may inhibit, or at least delay, the flowering of sugar beet and thereby may increase sugar yield. They may also reduce the size of sugar beet without reducing significantly the sugar yield thereby enabling an increase in planting density to be made.Similarly in other root crops e.g. turnip, swede, mangold, parsnip, beetroot, yam and cassava it may be possible to increase the planting density. The compounds could be useful in restricting the vegetative growth of cotton thereby leading to an increase in cotton yield. The compounds may be useful in rendering plants resistant to stress since the compounds can delay the emergence of plants grown from seed, shorten stem height and delay flowering these properties could be useful in preventing frost damage in countries where there is significant snow cover in the winter since then the treated plants would remain below the snow cover during the cold weather. Further the compounds may cause drought or cold resistance in certain plants. When applied as seed treatments at low rates the compounds can have a growth stimulating effect on plants. In carrying out the plant growth regulating method of the invention, the amount of compound to be applied to regulate the growth of plants will depend upon a number of factors, for example the particular compound selected for use, and the identity of the plant species whose growth is to be regulated. However, in general an application rate of 0.1 to 15, preferably 0.1 to 5, kg per hectare is used. However, on certain plants even application rates within these ranges may give undesired phytotoxic effects. Routine tests may be necessary to determine the best rate of application of a specific compound for any specific purpose for which it is suitable. The compounds may be used as such for fungicidal or plant growth regulating purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides also a fungicidal or plant growth regulating composition comprising a compound which is an enantiomer of the invention or an ester, salt or complex thereof, and a carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of combating fungal diseases in a plant, which method comprises applying to the plant, to seed of the plant or to the locus of the plant or seed a compound which is an enantiomer of the invention or an ester, salt or complex thereof. It also provides a method of regulating the growth of a plant, which method comprises applying to the plant, to seed of the plant or to the locus of the plant or seed a compound which is an enantiomer of the inventionOr an ester, salt or complex thereof as hereinbefore defined. The compounds can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, to seeds.or to other medium in which plants are growing or are to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a.vapour. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition.The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum,Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler.Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous. dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers e.g. 2ethoxyethanol and 2 butoxyethanol . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, e.g. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a microencapsulated form. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers e.g. nitrogen , potassium or phosphorus containing fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the compound, are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising a compound as hereinbefore defined. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants e.g. wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s . These.agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium dilsopropyl and triisopropyl naphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium carboxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , the concentrate to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s .These concentrates suitably contain organic acids e.g. alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylenesulphonic acid or dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredient s in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates.The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.00058 or 0.01 to 10 by weight of active ingredient s may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity, e.g.compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal or plant growth regulating activity or compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity. The other fungicidal compound can be for example one which is capable of combating ear diseases of cereals e.g. wheat such as Septoria, Gibberella and Helminthosporium spp., seed and soil borne diseases and downy and powdery mildews on grapes and powdery mildew and scab on apple etc. These mixtures of fungicides can have a broader spectrum of activity than the compound of general formula I alone further the other fungicide can have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal activity of the compound of general formula I .Examples of the other fungicidal compounds are imazalil, benomyl, carbendazim BCM , thiophanate methyl, captafol, captan, sulphur, thiabendazole, dithiocarbamates, carbathiins, copper oxychloride, triforine, dodemorph, tridemorph, dithianon, pyrazophos, binapacryl, quinomethionate, panoctine, furalaxyl, aluminium tris ethylphosphonate , DPX3217, ethirimol, dimethirimol, bupirimate, chlorothalonil,Chevron RE20615, vinclozolin, procymidone, iprodione and metaxanine. The compounds of the invention can be mixed with soil, peat or other, rooting media for the protection of plants against seed borne, soil borne or foliar fungal diseases. Suitable insecticides are pirimor, croneton, dimethoate, metasystox and formothion. The other plant growth regulating compound can be one which controls weeds or seedhead formation, improves the level or longevity of the plant growth regulating activity of the compounds of general formula I , selectively controls the growth of the less desirable plants e.g. grasses or causes the compound of general formula I to act faster or slower as a plant growth regulating agent. Some of these other agents will be herbicides.Examples of suitable agents are the gibberellins e.g. GA3, GA4 Or GA7 , the auxins e.g. indoleacetic acid, indolebutyric acid, naphthoxyacetic acid or naphthyl acetic acid , the cytokinins e.g. kinetin, diphenylurea, benzimidazole, benzyladenine or BAP , phenoxyacetic acids e.g. 2,4 D or MCPA , substituted benzoic acids e.g. TIBA , morphactins Ceg. chlorf luorecol , maleic hydrazide, glyphosate, glyphosine, long chain fatty alcohols and acids e.g.Off Shoot O or Off ShootT , dikegulac, Sustar, Embark, substituted quaternary ammonium and phosphonium compounds Ce.g. CCC or PhosfonD , Ethrel, carbetamide, Racuza, Alar, asulam, abscissic acid, isopyrimol, RH531, hydroxybenzonitriles e.g. bromoxynil , Avenge, Suffix or Lontrel. The following Example illustrate the invention the temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade . EXAMPLE 1 2R,3R 1 4 chlorophenyl 4,4 dimethyl 2 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl pentan 3 ol the enantiomer of Compound 1 A solution of alpha p chlorobenzyl alpha 1,2,4 triazol 1 yl pinacolone in methanol 20ml was treated portionwise with sodium borohydride 0.26g . The reaction mixture was then ref fluxed for one hour. The solvent was removed in vacuo and hydrochloric acid 1 N 40ml was added to the residue. The white precipitate was filtered off, washed with water, dried and crystallised from aqueous ethanol to give the racemic mixture 2R, 3R 2S, 3S 4 chlorophenyl 4,4 dimethyl 2 1,2,4 triazol l yl pentan 3 one as a white crystalline solid, m.p. 162 164 . The racemic mixture 9.6g and camphor sulphonic acid 9.2g in ethanol ethyl acetate 1 1 150ml were ref fluxed for 16 hours. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was treated with petroleum ether C6080 ethyl acetate 1 1 250ml . Filtration of the mixture gave a solid 7.8 g , m.p. 167 , which was crystallised from acetonitrile. The crystals which crystallised at room temperature were filtered off to give crystals 3.6g , m.p. 168 170 , of the camphor sulphonic acid salt of the .enantiomer. These crystals were mixed with water 25m1 , and the mixture treated with ammonia 10m1 and stirred for 2 hours.
