# Flush glass window assembly for automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
A flush glass window assembly for an automotive vehicle body includes a vertically movable window glass 24 adapted to be raised and lowered in a window opening 14 in a window frame 16,18,20,22 and guide means 30,32,34,40,42 for guiding the glass during vertical move ment such that along essentially its entire path of movement the inner surface of each side edge of the glass is adjacent to and spaced outwardly from respective outwardly facing sealing surfaces 44,46,48 in the window frame thereby avoiding frictional resistance to vertical movement and such that as the glass approaches its full raised position the glass moves toward and into contact with the respective outwardly facing sealing surfaces to form a compression seal there with, the upper portion of the glass in its full up position within the window opening being substantially flush with the adjacent frame portions and the upwardly facing edge of the top of the glass forming a compression seal with a down wardly facing sealing surface 28 in the window frame.
