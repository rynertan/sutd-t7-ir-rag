## Description
The present invention relates to a cellulose dope, a process for the preparation of this dope, a shaped article formed from this dope, and a method for the application of this dope Shaped articles of regenerated celluloses are ordinarily prepared by dissolving cellulose in a solvent by appropriate means and ntroducing the obtained dope into a nonsolvent or regenerating solvent by using an extruder. Even at present the cellulose dissolving methods that can be used on an industrial scale for this purpose are only the cuprammonium method and viscose method which leveloped as early as the end of the 1890 s. In each of the dopes obtained according to these methods, t e cellulose does not dissolve as cellulose itself in the dissolved state but it is dissolved in the form of a certain cellulose derivative. Accordingly, regeneration is necessary for converting this cellulose derivative to the so called regenerated cellulose. Furthermore, both in the preparation process of dopes according to these methods and in the shaping process from these dopes, many problems arise from the view point of the working environment for labors and environmental pollution because heavy metals are discharger and toxic gases are generated. Although these methocs are not utilized industrially, many cellulose dissolving methods using a metal complex have been known. As the metal complex used for lissolving cellulose, Cadoxene cadmium ethylene diamine alkali , Coxene cobalt ethylene diamine akali , Zincoxene zinc ethylene diamine alkali , Nioxene nickel ethylene diamine alkali and EWNN iron tartaric acid alkali are noted. However, these methods are not superior to the cuprammonium method or viscose method because toxic components such as heavy metals and amines are used, and thus, the e methods are disadvantageous from an economical viewpoint. The viscose method using carbon disulfide is now adopted by the majority of enterprises in the industry of regenerated celluloses. However, in Europe and America, manufacturers have become apprehensive about industrial continuation of the viscose method because of the above mentioned problems, and thus many enterprises withdiew from the viscose rayon industry in the 1960 s and 1970 s. In order to overcome the defects of the known cellulose dissolving methods, a method for obtaining novel regenerated cellulose shaped articles such as fiber and film in a closed system by dissolving cellulose directly in an organic solvent has been sought since the 1970 s, mainly in Canada and the U.S.A., and as a result, various methods have been developed and proposed. However, these methods use a complicated multi component solvent system which s very expensive, and none of these methods have been used yet in practice because of toxicity, explosiveness and difficulties in recovering the solvents. Moreover, these newly developed methods are very similar to the viscose method or cuprammonium method in the technical idea of converting cellulose to a certain derivative and dissolving the cellulose n the form of this derivative. For example, in the method of using dimethylsulfoxide paraformaldehyde, ce ulose is dissolved in the form of methylol cellulose, and in the method of using dimethylformamide N It is known that if the degree of polymerization hereinafter referred to as DP of cellulose is extremely low for example, DP 10 , the cellulose is soluble in not oily an aqueous alkali solution but also hot dimethylsulfoxide. However, the degree of polymerization of this soluble cellulose is necessary lower than 20, and a shaped article made from this cellulose does not have satisfactory mechanical properties and cannot be put to practical use. The reason why cellulose having an extremely low degree of polymerization is soluble in an aqueous alkali solution is that the polymeric characteristics of cellulose, for example, the molecular configuration defined by the hydrogen bond, are lost. It also is known that an aqueous solution containing about 10 by weight of sodium hydroxide shows a strong swelling action to cellulose having a high degree of polymerization. Journal of Prakt. Chem N.F., It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to pro ide a cellulose dope prepared by dissolving a cellulose having a relatively high degree of polymerization in an aqueous alkali solution at a low temperature, which can be economically advantageously shaped into an excellent fiber, film or other article or applied to the surface or interior treatment of other material by coating or dipping. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of this cellulose dope and a method for the application of this cellulose dope. In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a stable cellulose dope suitable for shaping, which consists of an aqueous alkali solution containing substantially at least 3 by weight of cellulose having a degree of polymerization of at least 100, wherein in the In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of the above mentioned cellulose dope which comprises maintaining a mixture comprising 100 parts by weight of a cellulose having a degree of polymerization of at least 100, which may I ave any known crystal form, and 10 to 1000 parts by weight of a water containing hydrogen bond cleaving agent or 79 to 1000 parts by weight of a non aqueous hydrogen bond cleaving agent at a temperature of 100 C to 350 C under a pressure of 1.01 to 2.53 mPa 10 to 250 atmospheres , promptly discharging the mixture in the open air, mixing the resulting cellulose with an aqueous alkali solution maintained at a temperature lower than 50 C, and then stirring the mixture at a temperature lower than 10 C to dissolve the ce ulose in the aqueous alkali solution. In still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pro ess for the preparation of cellulose dope set forth in claim 1, which comprises mixing cellulose having to crystal form of cellulose I with a solvent capable of dissolving cellulose solidifying the mixture either by removing a part of a volatilizable solvent component or introducing the mixture into an organic solvent, followed by regeneration of the solidified cellulose derivative where the cellulose has been converted to he cellulose derivative in the above step of mixing the cellulose with the solvent, and then, mixing the cellulose with an aqueous alkali solution having a concentration of 6 to 12 by weight maintained at a temperature not higher than 50 C and stirring the mixture at a temperature not higher than 10 C to dissolve the cellulose in the aqueous alkali solution. In still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cellulose shaped article having a well developed intramolecular hydrogen bond made by passing th above mentioned cellulose dope through a coagulating bath and then a neutralizing bath by using an ordinary extruder, and thereafter drawing and winding the coagulated cellulose. In still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treating an article which comprises coating or dispersing the above mentioned dope on the surface of the article or in the interior thereof directly or after dilution, and then neutralizing the applied dope. The present invention provides a stable dope suitable for shaping which contains cellulose at a high concentration. More particularly, the dope of the present invention is an aqueous alkali solution containing at least 3 by weight of cellulose having a degree of polymerization o at least 100, and which is not gelatinized after standing for at least 2 days at room temperature. The nost characteristic feature of the dope of the present invention is that in the Furthermore, the cellulose in the dope of the present invention is different from the cellulose in the cuprammonium solutior or viscose solution customarily used on an industrial scale in that in its dissolved state, there is no specific coordination of the alkali and no derivatization of cellulose, and therefore in the case of the cellulose dcpe of the present invention, the so called regeneration operation need not be carried out in the shaping process. The cellulose in the dope of the present invention has a degree of polymerization of at least 100, preferably 200 to 700. If cellulose has a degree of polymerization higher than 700, the cellulose is not suitable for the shaping operation because the viscosity of the dope is high and the dope is readily gelled. However, this problem can be solved if the shaping operation is carried o it by using an extruder or the like immediately after the preparation of the dope. Accordingly, the upper limit of the degree of polymerization is not particularly critical in the present invention. The cellulose dope of the present invention can be obtained by subjecting cellulose the crystal form is not particularly critical to a preliminary treatment to form cellulose in which the C An example of the cellulose to be used for the preparation of the dope of the present invention is obtained by maintaining a mixture of cellulose having a crystal form of cellulose I natural cellulose or cellulose having a crystal form of cellulose II, III, or IV regenerated cellulose and a hydrogen bond cleaving agent at a temperature of 100 C to 350 C under a pressure Of 1.01 t 2.53MPa 10 to 250 atmospheres and abruptly exposing the cellulose to the ambient atmosphere at normal temperature. The temperature and pressure under which the mixture of cellulose with a hydrogen bond cleaving agent is maintained, interrelate with each other and, for example, the pressure is generally equivalent to a vapor pressure of a volatilizable component in the hydrogen bond cleaving agent at a specific temperature. Accordingly, the maintaining temperature must be lower than the thermal decomposition point of the cellulose 350 C . If re utilization of the volatilizable component other than water is intended, the operation should be carried out at a temperature lower than the thermal decomposition point of the volatilizable component. Where an outer pressure other than the vapor pressure, for example, a pressure given by an extruder, is applied, the treatment temperature should be appropriately elevated depending upon the outer pressure. The time for maintaining the cellulose in the above mentioned environment is not particularly critical and this time is determined so as not to bring about thermal decomposition of the cellulose. Ordinarily, it is sufficient if the cellulose is maintained for 20 seconds to 20 minutes in the above mentioned environment. As the hydrogen bond cleaving agents, there can be mentioned, for example, water containing hydrogen bond cleaving agents such as water, an aqueous solution of an alkali, an aqueous solution of an inorganic acid, an aqueous solution of a salt, an aqueous solution if hydrogen peroxide, an aqueous solution of a urea compound, an aqueous solution or dispersion of an amphoteric oxide or amphoteric hydroxide, and non aqueous hydrogen bond cleaning agents selected from a glycol, an amide, a sulfoxide, a halogenated acetic acid, and a polyphenol. Of course, a mixture of two or more of the foregoing agents may be used. In the case of a hydrogen bond cleaving agent in the form of an aqueous solution or dispersion, the main component of this agent may be supplied in the solid state to cellulose swollen with water. The concentration of the main component based on water to be supplied to the cellulose is not particularly critical. The saturation concentration of the main componer in water is regarded as the upper limit. Supposing that the molecular chain of the cellulose to be treated is completely constructed through intramolecular hydrogen bonds one hydrogen bond per glucose residue , the main component can be added in an amount of 1 to 3 equivalents to the hydrogen bond. The addition of a larger amount of the main component is economically disadvantageous. In the case of an acidic aqueous solution, if the pH value is too low, degradation of the cellulose takes place to an undesirably large extent. Accordingly, the amount of the acid should be appropriately adjusted. Ordinarily, for an acidic aqueous solution, the concentration is preferably lower than 10 by weight. Since the dope of the present invention is an aqueous alkali solution containing the treated cellulose in the dissolved state, excessive use of an acidic aqueous solution at the step of treating the cellulose is not preferred from the economical viewpoint. From the viewpoint of the safety, it is necessary that an oxidative substance such as nitric acid, hydrogen peroxide or perchloric acid should be used at a low concentration in an amount as small as possible. As the aqueous alkali solution to be used as the hydrogen bond cleaving agent, there can be mentioned aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, beryllium hydroxide, calcium oxide, sodium silicate, sodium carbonate, and tetra alkyl ammonium. As the aqueous solution of an inorganic acid, there can be mentioned aqueous solutions of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, orthophosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, pyrophosphoric acid perchloric acid, hypochlorous acid, chlorous acid, nitrous acid, sulfurous acid, and boric acid. As the aqueous solution of a salt, there can be mentioned aqueous solutions of lithium chloride, zinc chloride, calcium hiocyanate, ammonium thiocyanate, and sodium thiocyanate. Oxides and hydroxides of aluminum and zinc are preferably used as the amphoteric oxide and hydroxide. The above mentioned cellulose treatment can be carried out ether batchwise or in a continuous manner. In the case of the batchwise treatment, a mixture of cellulose and a hydrogen bond cleaving agent is charged in a pressure vessel, and the mixture is externally heated at 100 C to 350 C and allowed to stand in an atmosphere of the vapor pressure of the volatilizable component in the mixture for several seconds to several minutes. Then, a valve and nozzle attached to the pressure vessel are opened to abruptly reduce the pressure in the pressure vessel, whereby the treatment is completed. The obtained cellulose is fed to the subsequent dissolving step, if necessary after water washing and drying. In the case of the continuous treatment, the above mentioned mixture is supplied to an externally heated monoaxial or biaxial screw type extruder, where the mixture is compressed by the vapor pressure of the volatilizable component in the mixture and by the pitch arrangement of screws of the extruder and thereby discharged from the tip end of the extruder. In this case, external heating may be effected on respective zones independently of the extruder, and mixing of the cellulose with the hydrogen bond cleaving agent may be performed in the extruder. More specifically, there may be adopted a method in which the hydrogen bond cleaving agent is injected under pressure through an inlet formed on the side portion of the extruder into the extruder while the cellulose is supplied into the extruder by a feed screw. An optional combination of a feed screw, a reverse screw, and a seal screw may be used as the screw. The polymerization degree of the cellulose may be adjusted by an acid or alkali before the above mentioned treatment or may be adjusted during the above operation. At any rate, the degree of polymerization is adjusted to at least 100. Finally, the mixture of the thus treated cellulose and the hydrogen bond cleaving agent is subjected to water washing or the like to remove the foreign matter and is then dried. The component in the hydrogen bond cleaving agent, which has no adverse effect on the solubility of the cellulose, may be left in the treated cellulose. In principle, a substance having no acidity may be left in the treated cellulose. The cellulose dope of the present invention can also be prepared according to the following procedures. Namely, cellulose having a crystal form of cellulose I is mixed with a solvent capable of dissolving cellulose to destroy the crystal form of cellulose I. When the cellulose is mixed with the solvent, the cellulose may be chemically modified with the solvent whereby the cellulose is converted to a cellulose derivative. A part of the volatile solvent component is removed from the mixture to effect solidification or the mixture is introduced into an organic solvent to effect solidification. Where the cellulose is chemically modified with the solvent, the solidified cellulose derivative is subjected to a regenerating step. The thus obtained cellulose is dipped in an aqueous alkali solution having a concentration of 6 to 12 by weight at a temperature not higher than 50 C and the mixture is stirred at a temperature not higher than 7 C, or the cellulose is directly introduced into an aqueous alkali solution at a temperature not higher than 7 C and the mixture is stirred, whereby the cellulose is dissolved to form the dope of the present invention. Furthermore, the dope of the present invention can be obtained by dipping the treated cellulose in an aqueous alkali solution at a temperature not higher than 50 C, freezing the mixture, and then dissolving the frozen mixture at a temperature not higher than 7 C. By the term alkali used herein are meant sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, beryllium hydroxide and cesium hydroxide. Of these, sodium hydroxide is preferred from the economical viewpoint. In the dope of the present invention, the cellulose is dissolved in the state where, as pointed out hereinbefore, there is neither an interamolecular hydrogen bond nor a specific coordination of the alkali to the glucose ring. This dissolved state is quite different from the dissolved state in a cuprammonium solution or viscose solution. Accordingly, it is characteristic that a cellulose shaped article prepared from the dope of the present invention becomes quite different from the cellulose shape articles prepared from the known dopes. Shaping of the cope of the present invention can be accomplished by using an ordinary extrusion apparatus. Namely, the dope is extruded from a spinneret or slit, coalgulated, drawn and then neutralized, whereby the dope is shaped into a fiber or a film. Since the cellulose is completely molecularly dispersed in the dope of the present invention, when the dissolved cellulose is solidified by neutralization, a higher order structure is readily formed. The most characteristic feature of a cellulo e shaped article obtained from the dope of the present invention is that the shaped article has a higher in amolecular hydrogen bond forming ability than that of a known regenerated cellulose fiber or film. The int amolecular hydrogen bond forming ability can be evaluated by the infrared absorption or NMR analysis. Since the shaped article obtained from the dope of the present invention has a high intramolecular hydrogen bond forming ability as pointed out above, the shaped article has excellent mechanical properties and cherr cal resistance. Since the dope of the present invention does not contain a toxic gas or a heavy metal, the treatment of the surface or interior of other material or shaped articles becomes possible with the dope of the present invention, though industrial working of this treatment according to the conventional techniques is impossible because of occurrence of environmental pollution or the like. Namely, the surface or interior of other material or shaped articles can be easily treated with a cellulose by dipping the material or shaped articles in the dope of the present invention or an aqueous alkali dilution thereof and removing the excessive cellulose solution by a press, a roll or a doctor knife, or by spraying or oating the cellulose solution on the material or shaped articles, and then heat treating the material or shaped articles and effecting neutralization. If this treatment is applied to a synthetic fibrous material, a very durable antistatic effect or moisture absorbing effect can be attained, and in some cases, the lowering of physical properties by heat treatment can be prevented or the adhesiveness can be improved. Furthermore, the dope of the present invention can be used for improving the hand of a textile material. Moreover, if the dope of the present invention is coated on a shaped article of an inorganic substance such as mortar or concrete, a moisture condensation preventing effect can be attained. In addition, if the dope of the prese it invention is mixed with mortar or cement in advance, an effect of reinforcing the shaped article can be attained. Where the dope of the present invention is applied to a polyester fibrous material, under certain treatment conditions retreatment temperature and time and alkali concentration , the fibrous material can be modified and improved by performing the treatment with the dope of the present invention accompanying the so called weight reduction treatment of polyester fiber by alkali. Furthermore, if the dope of the present invention is applied to a polyacrylonitrile fibrous material with heating, the nitrile group of the polyacrylonitrile molecule is converted to an amide oxime group or carboxyl group by the action of the alkali, and therefore, a modifying effect due to chemical modification is given to the fibrous material. Moreover, if the dope of the present invention is applied to a cotton or regenerated cellulose fiber, modification with a mercerizing effect can be attained. Since the alkali is contained in the dope of the present invention, attainment of various secondary effects can be expacted, and an inexpensive and safe modification method can be provided. Of course, this modifying effect can be similarly attained when the dope of the present invention is applied to materials other than the above mentioned fibrous materials. The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following examples that by no means limit the scope of the invention. This example illustrates the process for preparing an alkali soluble cellulose directly from natural cellulose having a crystal form of cellulose I by using a twin screw extruder type high temperature high pressure apparatus. As the starting cellulose, there were used a saiccor pulp having an average degree of polymerization 910 obtained from eucalyptus and an acid hydrolysis product thereof depolymerized pulp having an average degree of polymerization degree 580. A twin screw extruder Model α 100 supplied by Suehiro Tekkosho was used as the high temperature high pressure apparatus. This extruder was characterized by a treating capacity of 50 to 100 kg hr, a screw rotation of 65 to 260 rpm, a temperature control range of up to 300 C, a pressure resistance of up to 200 kg cm The pressure under which the saiccor pulp and its acid hydrolysis product were treated was 20 to 50 kg cm When the untreated cellulose was dissolved under the same conditions, an opaque liquid having a low viscosity was formed. Substantially all of the view field of an optical microscope under cross Nicol s prisms was a bright field by the existence of the undissolved portion. It was almost impossible to remove this undissolved portion by a filter press or the like. When CP MAS The acid hydrolyzed saiccor pulp was treated in the same manner as described above except that the amount of water as a hydrogen bond cleaving agent was changed to 0.1 part by weight. A slightly fibrilated powdery product was obtained, and the degree of polymerization was reduced to 320 from 580. When the powdery product was dissolved according to the above mentioned procedures, the solubility was improved over that of the untreated pulp, but the presence of a considerable undissolved portion was optically observed. In this example, by using the same two screw extruder as used in Example 1 and adopting the same conditions as adopted in Example 1, a hydrogen bond cleaving agent shown in Table 1 was added to a cellulose in an amount shown in Table 1, and the treated cellulose was dissolved at a cellulose concentration of 6.5 by weight in the same manner as described in Example 1, after or without removal of the foreign substances. The obtained results are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, o indicates that the dope of the present invention was obtained, Δ indicates that a dope was obtained in which the undissolved portion content was about 10 by weight and the solubility was considerably improved over that of the untreated pulp, and x indicates that a dope almost similar to that of the untreated cellulose was obtained. The starting celluloses used in this example were Alska Pulp A DP 750 , cotton linter B DP 1100 , and a fiber C DP 550 regenerated from a cuprammonium solution. As is apparent from the results shown in Table 1, dopes of the present invention can be prepared by using hydrogen bond cleaving agents. Furthermore, it is seen that a s bstance left in the treated cellulose sometimes shows ar adverse effect when the treated cellulose is dissolved in an aqueous alkali solution. Accordingly, this point should be taken into consideration at the actual operation. In each of the This example illustrates a process for treating a cellulose according to the so called explosion method, wherein a mixture of the cellulose and water is maintained under high temperature and high pressure conditions for a short time and the mixture is then promptly discharged into the open air, and a process for preparing a dope comprising this treated cellulose and an aqueous alkali solution. A wood pulp treated with 5N sulfuric acid at 60 C for 90 minutes was used as the natural cellulose. When the viscosity of the cellulose in Cadoxene was measured, it was found that the degree of polymerization of the cellulose was about 600. A slurry mixture was ormed by immersing 500 g of the cellulose in 5 ℓ of water as a hydrogen bond cleaving agent and stirring the mixture. Then, the mixture was charged in an autoclave having a capacity of 180 ℓ. A silicone oil heated at 270 C was circulated in a jacket of the autoclave, and when five minutes had passed from the point when the temperature in the autocalve reached 250 C, a reducing valve was promptly opened to reduce the pressure. Then, 4650 g of an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution having a concentration of 9 by weight was poured into a Henschel dissolver equipped with a jacket, the temperature of which was cor rolled to 20 C, and 350 g of the obtained cellulose was gradually added thereto with stirring. When 30 minutes had passed from the point of completion of the addition of the cellulose, the jacket temperature was lowered to 10 C and stirring was conducted for 3 hours. When the obtained solution was observed by an optical microscope under cross Nicol s prisms, almost no undissolved particles were found. The cellulose solution was diluted to a cellulose concentration of 5 by weight by an aqueous deuterated sodium hydroxide solution having a concentration of 9 by weight, and the The cellulose solution was cast at a thickness of 500 µm on a glass sheet by using a knife coater and the cast solution was coagulated by an aqueous sodium sulfate solutic having a concentration of 10 by weight. The formed film was washed with 2 by weight sulfuric acid, washed with water, and then dried. The film was transparent and had a strength sufficient for the practical use. This example illustrates various dopes formed by dissolving the acid hydrolyzed saiccor pulp treated in Example 1 in various aqueous alkali solutions differing in concentratior The dissolution conditions and the properties and stability of the dopes are shown in Table 2. The dis olution was performed by using a Henschel type mixer. This example illustrates an embodiment of the process for preparing cellulose used for the production of the cellulose dope of the present invention. Natural cellulose wood pulp having a degree of polymerization reduced to 530 by the acid hydrolysis method 5N H First, 20 g of the cellulose was dissolved in 300 g of Schweitze s reagent under cooling at 5 C to 10 C to form a homogeneous cellulose solution. The cellulose was coagulated and regenerated under the conditions shown in Table 3. The obtained cellulose was dissolved in an aqueous 9.1 by weight NaOH solution at a cellulose concentration of 8 by weight. The obtained res Its are shown in Table 3. In the This example illustrates a treated cellulose used for the preparation of the cellulose dope of the present invention, which was prepared by a physical treatment conducted while using a hydrogen bond cleaving agent. A mercerized product treated with an aqueous 18 by weight NaOH solution for 30 minutes, followed by water washing and drying of the natural cellulose DP 530 used in Example 5 was used as the starting cellulose. First, 100 g of the cellulose was immersed in a hyc ogen bond cleaving agent shown in Table 4 for a predetermined time, and then the mixture was sufficiently kneaded by an extruder at a predetermined temperature. Then, the mixture was introduced in an acetone metanol 1 1 volume ratio to obtain the cellulose used in this invention, and the obtained cellulos was washed by the same solvent mixture, and dried in vacuum at room temperature. The dissolution sate of the cellulose was examined. The obtained results are shown in Table 4. Each cellulose had a good solubility in an aqueous 9.1 by weight NaOH solution. In the A fibrous polymeric material shown in Table 5 was treated with a cellulose dope of the present invention comprising cellulose and an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, obtained in Example 5, to give a moisture absorbing property and an antistatic property to the fibrous polymeric material. The cellulose dope was diluted with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution having a concentration of 9.1 by weight so that the cellulose concentration was 1 by weight, whereby a homogeneous solution was obtained. Then, 5 g of a sample fabric was immersed in the solution maintained at 15 C and impregnated sufficiently with the solution. The fabric was squeezed so that the solution pick up was about 200 by weight. The fabric was immersed in an aqueous 1 by weight solution of sulfuric acid to effect neutralization. The sample was washed with running water and then dried at a temperature of 70 C. Each test was conducted after the treated fabric had been dyed under predetermined conditions. Each fabric before the treatment had a half value period of at least 90 seconds. Accordingly, it was confirmed that the application method of the present invention was very effective for imparting an antistatic effect. In this example, the half value period as one measure indicating the antistatic property was determined as follows. The sample was conditioned in an artificial weather chamber maintained at a temperature of 20 C and a relative humidity of 40 . The time required for the charge potential of the conditioned sample to be reduced to 1 2 was measured according to the method A of JIS L 1094. This time was shown as the half value period.
