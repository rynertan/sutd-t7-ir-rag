## Description
A threaded fastener capable of being manipulated in situ.at ti join between two membersThe invention relates to a threaded fastener which can be manipulated at the point where two members are brought together for joining that is, a device for tightening together two wooden members such as would make up a piece of furniture, or a staircase, or for fastening together two or more plastic elements, or, more generally speaking, any material whatever including metal, providing that such material is not excessively hard, or at any rate, provided that it will admit entry of a self tapping thread. The fastener is particularly suitable for applications where joints are to be concealed.The prior art in this field comprises a fastening device for furniture assembly having a capstan head bolt, which pairs with an internally and externally threaded sleeve, this being screwed into a hole in one member a cross member for instance whilst the head of said bolt is located in a recess cut in the hidden side of the longitudinal member to which the cross member must be butt joined at right angles. The shank of the bolt passes through a longitudinal hole in the longitudinal member and thence into the threaded sleeve.The fastener thus disclosed is ideal for use in mass production, but is less suited to the assemblycf better quality hand built furniture, where the time required in drilling holes into each of the two members separately not to mention ensuring their correct alignment is approx imately double that required in drilling a single hole in one member onlyThe prior art thus stands in need of further improvement with regard to the necessity for reducing time and labour required in the assembly of hand buiIt furniture and staircases, and other related productsFrom the foregoing, one may discern the need for a solution to the technical problem of realising a threaded fastener for joined wooden and plastic members, and members in other materials generally, which dispenses with the need for drilling one of the two said members whilst guaranteeing a solid joint, and permitting concealment of the recess where manipulation comes about, when said joint is viewed from the outsideThe invention described herein resolves the problem thus outlined by setting forth an axial element made up of a self tapping point, a prismatic intermediate element permitting manipulation, a shank incorporating an intermediate threaded collar of identical hand and pitch the selftapping point, and an enlarged head whose shouIder abutts with a coaxial sleeve when said self tapping port is driven home into the second member said sleeve, which completes the fastener described herein, being threaded internally so as to pair with said intermediate threaded collar, and lodged in the mouth of a longitudinal hole drilled in the first of the two members to be joined, the hole itself departing from a recess in said second member and accommodating the shank and head of the axial element, whilst the recess accommodates its prismatic element and seIf tapping point The advantage offered by the invention is a saving both in time and in labour costs at small factory and workshop level,The invention will now be described, by way of example, with the aid of accompanying drawings 3 sheets in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal section through the fastener seen inserted into the first of two members to be joined Figure 2 is the same section as illustrated in Fig 1, though showing the finished joint Figure 3 is a section through lil lil in Fig I Figure 4 is the same section as in Fig 1, and shows the application of a capstan for tightening purposes, rather than a spanner Figure 5 is the same section as in Fig 2, but showing the application as per Fig 4 Figure 6 is a section through IV li in Fig 4 Figure 7 is the same section as in Fig 4, showing a variation in the method of fixing the fastener to the first member Figure 8 is the same section as in Figure 7, showing a further variation of fixing to said first member Figure 9 is a section through IX IX in Figure 8 With reference to the drawings, I denotes the first member, and 2 the second member, these being of wood or other relatively soft material, and destined to be joined together.3 denotes the self tapping point of the fastener s axial element, and 4 is a prismatic intermediate element which turns as one with said self tapping point 3 when manipulated with a spanner, 5 denotes the shank of the axial element, coaxial with and departing from said prismatic intermediate element 4. A threaded collar 6 located at an intermediate point on said shank 5 is of identical hand and pitch to the threaded selftapping point 3, 7 denotes the rear end, or tail of the shank 5, whilst 8 denotes the enlarged head portion proper which butts against a previously inserted sleeve 9 when the fastener is screwed home tight, Said sleeve 9 must be lodged firmly before manipulating the fastener, and to this end has an external thread of coarser pitch than that of the point 3 and collar 6, this coarse, external thread being driven into said first member I, The sleeve s internal thread pairs with said collar 6, 10 denotes an axial hole driller in said member 1 which accommodates the fastener s head 8, shank 5 and sleeve 9, the latter being driven into the mouth of said axial hole, 11 denotes a recess formed in the fist member 1 at the point where this abutts with the second member 2, and offer ing one open side to permit access with a spanner, In Figure 4, 12 denotes a recess of circular cross section, left open at one side just enough to allow protrusion of part of the lateral surface 13 of a capstan 14, this cy lindrical in shape and fitted into said recess 12 so as to slide axially with respect to the fastener s prismatic manipulating element 4 The peripheral holes 15 in the capstan permit insertion of a tommy by means of which to turn capstan and fastener together,. In Figure 7, 16 denotes a prismatic extension of the sleeve 9 which remains fast thanks to a recessed portion 17 at one end of the capstan 14, and offers the option of embodying said sleeve 9 with an external thread of opposite hand to that of its internal thread so as to prevent unwarranted loosening once fitted.In fig 8, a circular plate 18 replaces the sleeve 9 and is preferable thereto, Holes 19 pass through the plate and permit insertion of screws 20 which hold the plate 18 itself solidly to the first member 1. A collar 21 incorporated into said circular plate 18 permits of locating the internal axial thread 22 which, occupying the th of plateand collar combined, affords the necessary stability when paired with the thread 6 offered by the fastener s shank 5, as well as ensuring alignment of the latter within the member s axial hole 10, 23 denotes a hole located eccentrically in satd circular plate 18 this serving to allow passage of the axial elementrs head 8, and therefore of greater diameter than that of hole 22 alongside, The fastener as illustrated in figs 1, 2 and 3 functions thus having drilled the hole in the first member I and cut out the recess II, the sleeve 9 is inserted to a tight fit in the mouth of the hole itself 1O, this done, a spanner is applied to the prismatic element 4 and a turning movement imparted,The fastener continues to be turned via its prismatic element 4 until the self tapping point 3 enters the second member 2, and tightened even to the extent that its collar 6 exits completely from the sleeve 9, The fastener is finally home once the shoulder of its head 8 abutts with the rear of the sleeve 9, and beyond this point, further pressure can be exerted to a degree just sufficient to draw the two members I and 2 tight, one against the other, and ensure a solid, well made butt join,. When carrying the invention into effect, materials adopted dimensions, and details of the design may all differ from the foregoing without by any means straying from within the bounds of protection afforded to the concept by appended claims for instance, the sleeve 9 instead of being threaded externally might equally well be pressed into its axial hole 10 in the first member 1.
