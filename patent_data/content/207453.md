## Description
This invention relates to novel heterocyclic substituted phenoxyalkylisoxazoles and furans, to methods for the preparation thereof, and compositions and methods for the use thereof as antiviral agents. Sterling Drug Inc. European Patent Application Publ. No. 111,345, published June 20, 1984 U.S. Pat. 4,451,476, issued May 29, 1984 discloses antivirally active compounds having the formula wherein Sterling Drug Inc. European Patent Application Publ. No. 137,242, published April 17, 1985, discloses antivirally active compounds having the formula wherein It has now been found that compounds wherein the oxazoline ring of the compounds of the latter reference is replaced by selected other heterocycles are also effective antiviral agents. Accordingly, the present invention relates to compounds of the formula wherein and A preferred class of compounds within the scope of Formula I are those of the formula Compositions for combating viruses comprise an antivirally effective amount of a compound of Formulas One can prepare a compound of Formula I by reacting a compound of the formula wherein Hal is chlorine, bromine or iodine, with an alkali metal salt of a compound of the formula One can also prepare a compound of Formula I by reacting a compound of the formula where Hal is bromine or iodine, with a compound of the formula Also disclosed are intermediates of the Formula V where R, Y and Z have the meanings given hereinabove R₁ and R₂ are halogen, methyl, nitro, lower alkoxycarbonyl or trifluoromethyl and Hal is bromine or iodine. The compounds of Formula I where Het is a nitrogen containing heterocyclic group are sufficiently basic to form stable acid addition salts with strong acids, and said salts are within the purview of the invention. The nature of the acid addition salt is immaterial, provided it is derived from an acid the anion of which is essentially non toxic to animal organisms. Examples of appropriate acid addition salts include the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, acid sulfate, maleate, citrate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, p toluenesulfonate, dodecyl sulfate, cyclohexanesulfamate, and the like. When the term halogen is used to define the substituents R₁ and R₂, any of the four common halogens, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine are contemplated and the term lower alkoxycarbonyl refers to such groups having from two to four carbon atoms. The process for the preparation of compounds of Formula The intermediates or Formula with a dihalide, Hal Y Hal, where Y is an alkylene bridge of 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Said alkali metal derivative is prepared The intermediates of Formula The intermediates of Formula In the alternative process comprising reacting compounds of Formulas The intermediates of Formula with a compound of Formula The organotin reagent of Formula VI is prepared by known procedures comprising reacting a tri lower alkyl tin halide with an unsubstituted aromatic heterocycle in the presence of a strong base such as butyllithium under anhydrous conditions. The trialkyltin moiety enters the most reactive position on the heterocyclic ring however, the trialkyltin moiety can be directed to other positions on the heterocyclic ring by using the appropriate halo substituted heterocycle. Certain compounds of the invention can be prepared by construction of the Het ring from intermediates having a cyano or formyl group on the phenyl ring, as follows. The compounds of Formula I where Het is a 2 thiazolyl group are prepared from the corresponding cyanophenyl compounds of the formula by conversion of the latter to the corresponding thioamide with hydrogen sulfide in pyridine, and then reacting the thioamide with a haloalkanone, R₃CH Hal CO R₄. The compounds of Formula I where Het is a tetrazole group are prepared from the corresponding cyanophenyl compounds of Formula IX by reaction of the latter with sodium azide to give a tetrazole when R₃ is hydrogen. Treatment of the latter with a lower alkyl halide in the presence of a base gives both isomeric tetrazoles where R₃ is lower alkyl. The structures of the compounds of the invention were established by the modes of synthesis, by elementary analysis, and by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The following examples will further illustrate the invention. To a solution of the desired heterocyclic compound in dry ether at 0 C. under nitrogen was added n butyllithium. The reaction mixture was heated at reflux for 15 min., then cooled to 30 C. and trimethyltin chloride was added. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and then poured into water. The ether layer was separated, washed with water and passed through an alumina column, eluting with hexane. V Y CH₂ ₅, Z N, R CH₃, R₁ 2 CH₃, R₂ 6 CH₃, Hal I was prepared from 10.0 g 2,6 dimethyl 4 iodophenol, 9.4 g 5 5 bromopentyl 3 methylisoxazole and 2.9 g potassium hydroxide in 100 ml acetonitrile by a procedure analogous to that of Example 1 c , and was obtained as a pale yellow oil 15.0 g, 94 after chromatography. A mixture of 5 5 2,6 dimethyl 4 iodophenoxy pentyl 3 methylisoxazole produced according to General Technique A, organotin reactant produced according to General Technique B, and dichlorobis triphenylphosphine palladium in tertrahydrofuran was heated at reflux under nitrogen for 5 hrs. The reaction mixture was extracted with ether and the ether extracts washed with water and chromatographed. To a solution of the desired heterocyclic compound in 100 ml ether at 78 C. under nitrogen was added dropwise 9.5M n butyllithium. There was then added a solution of trimethyltin chloride in 15 ml ether cooled to 78 C. The reaction mixture after warming to room temperature was filtered and extracted with ether. The ether extracts were dried over potassium carbonate, concentrated, and passed through neutral alumina. By analogous procedures it is contemplated that benzoxazole and benzothiazole can be converted to the respective 2 trimethylstannyl derivatives, and the latter caused to react with 5 5 2,6 dichloro 4 iodophenoxy pentyl 3 methylisoxazole to give, respectively, 5 5 2,6 dichloro 4 benzoxazol 2 yl phenoxy pentyl 3 methylisoxazole II R₁ and R₂ Cl, Het benzoxazol 2 yl and 5 5 2,6 dichloro 4 benzothiazol 2 yl phenoxyl pentyl 3 methylisoxazole II R₁ and R₂ Cl, Het benzothiazol 2 yl . A mixture of 14.7 g 5 5 2,6 dichloro 4 cyanophenoxy pentyl 3 methylisoxazole Example 21a , 2.96 g sodium azide and 0.32 g ammonium chloride in 150 ml dimethylformamide was stirred and heated at 100 C. for 24 hrs. The reaction mixture was concentrated A mixture of 6.4 g 5 5 2,6 dichloro 4 1H tetrazol 5 yl phenoxy pentyl 3 methylisoxazole Example 22 , 2.8 g methyl iodide and 3.0 g milled potassium carbonate in 200 ml acetonitrile was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was filtered and concentrated Biological evaluation of compounds of Formulas I and II has shown that they possess antiviral activity. They are useful in inhibiting virus replication The MIC values were determined by a standard plaque reduction assay as follows HeLa Ohio cells in monolayers were infected at a concentration of virus to give approximately 80 plaques per monolayer in the virus control no drug present . The compound to be tested was serially diluted and included in the agar medium overlay and in some cases, during the adsorption period as well. The MIC was determined to be that concentration of compound which reduced the number of plaques by 50 with respect to the untreated virus control. In the standard test procedure, the compounds were tested against a panel of fifteen human rhinovirus HRV serotypes, namely HRV 2, 1A, 1B, 6, 14, 21, 22, 15, 25, 30, 50, 67, 89, 86 and 41. The MIC value for each rhinovirus serotype was determined, and the efficacy of each compound was determined in terms of a MIC₈₀ value, which is the concentration of the compound required to inhibit 80 of the tested serotypes. The following Table gives the testing results with the compounds of the invention. For some of the compounds, the MIC₈₀ value is based on the testing of fewer than 15 rhinovirus serotypes. In these cases the number of serotypes N is indicated in parentheses after the MIC₈₀ figure. The antiviral compositions are formulated for use by preparing a dilute solution or suspension in a pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous, organic or aqueous organic medium for parenteral administration by intravenous or intramuscular injection, or for intranasal or ophthalmic application or are prepared in tablet, capsule, or aqueous suspension form with conventional excipients for oral administration.
