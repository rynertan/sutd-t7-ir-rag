## Description
This invention relates to a process for preparing 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid by the reaction of potassium ss naphtholate with carbon dioxide. 2 Hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid is useful as an intermediate for pigments and dyes. Industrially, it is produced by the reaction of sodium ss naphtholate with carbon dioxide, and a solid gas phase reaction called the Kolbe Schmitt reaction has been used traditionally.This method involves repetitions of carboxylation and the recovery of by product ss naphthol under reduced pressure, and has the defect that a long reaction time of more than 30 hours is required, losses of ss naphthol are large because of the thermal non uniformity of the reaction at high temperatures, and changes in phase during the reaction make it difficult to control the reaction and thus to obtain stable yields BIOS FINAL REPORT, No. 986, pages 234 to 238 . In an attempt to remove this defect, there have been proposed a method which comprises carboxylating an alkali metal ss naphtholate under a carbon dioxide pressure of 30 to 130 kg cm2 using naphthol as a solvent U. S.Patent No. 4,057,576 , a method which comprises carboxylating a mixture of sodium 8 naphtholate and potassium ss naphtholate U. S. Patent No. 4,032,568 , etc.These methods, however, have not gained commercial acceptance because they require the use of expensive devices, or the yield of the desired product is not satisfactory. Recently, a method which comprises continuously reacting a mixture being liquid under the reaction conditions and consisting of sodium 8 naphtholate, B naphthol and a light oil or kerosene in a specified ratio came into commercial operation, and a marked improvement in the yield and quality of the final product has been achieved.However, the yield of the final product based on sodium 8 naphtholate in this method does not exceed 50 U. S. Patent No. 4,239,913 . It is an object of this invention therefore to improve the industrial mass production method of producing 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid. In order to achieve this object, we studied a method by which the reaction of a mixture of potassium ss naphtholate and B naphthol with carbon dioxide is carried out in the liquid phase. This study has led to the discovery that by using a specified liquid as a reaction medium, the amounts of f3 naphthol becomes freed during the addition or the reaction distributed to the potassium ss naphtholate layer and the reaction medium layer can be conveniently controlled so that the yield of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid can be increased greatly. Thus, according to this invention, there is provided a process for preparing 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid, which comprises reacting a mixture being liquid under the reaction conditions and consisting of 1 potassium 8 naphtholate, 2 B naphthol and 3 at least one reaction medium selected from the group consisting of aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic ethers with carbon dioxide at a temperature of at least 1800 C and a carbon dioxide pressure of at least 1 kg cm2 means gauge pressures in this invention . The process of this invention gives 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid in a high yield and purity by simple and economical means. The yield of the desired product based on potassium B naphtholate reaches 80 or more.The by product 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid can be easily separated, and utilized as a material for polymers and dyes. Work up of the reaction mixture is simple and gives the desired 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3carboxylic acid in high purity. Furthermore, B naphthol added or formed as a by product can be recovered almost completely. These favorable results are unexpected, and the present invention provides a marked improvement in the method of preparing 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid. Examples of the aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons used as the reaction medium in this invention include gasoline, kerosene, light oils gas oils , lubricant oils, white oils, mono , di or poly alkylbenzenes, mono , di or poly alkylnaphthalenes, diphenyl, alkylsubstituted diphenyls, diphenylalkanes, alkyl substituted diphenylalkanes and hydrogenated triphenyls. Examples of the aromatic ethers are diphenyl ether, anisole and ditolyl ether. Petroleum hydrocarbons are preferred as the hydrocarbons, and light oils gas oils , kerosene and mono , dior poly alkylnaphthalenes are especially preferred reaction media. The boiling range of the reaction medium is preferably 150 to 4000C, especially 180 to 38O0C. The mixture of potassium 8 naphtholate and B naphthol need to be thoroughly dehydrated. The mixture which is liquid under the reaction conditions can be obtained by dehydrating potassium ss naphtholate and ss naphthol in the presence of the reaction medium, or dehydrating them in the absence of the reaction medium and then adding the reaction medium. Alternatively, it may be obtained by adding potassium hydroxide in an amount less than the theoretical amount to B naphthol and dehydrating them in the presence or absence of the reaction medium.Preferably, 0.01 to 5 moles, especially 0.03 to 3 moles, of B naphthol is used per mole of potassium B naphtholate. Free ss naphthol performs the action of liquefying the reaction system, the action of forming monopotassium 2hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylate and potassium ss naphtholate from dipotassium 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylate as schematically shown belowEMI3.1 the action of increasing the yield of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid by the carboxylation of potassium ss naphtholate, and the action of decomposing the by product 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid salt. The reaction of the aforesaid liquid mixture with carbon dioxide is carried out in accordance with this invention at a temperature of at least 1800 C, preferably 230 to 3500C, especially preferably 240 to 330 C under 2 a carbon dioxide pressure of at least 1 kg cm2, preferably 2 least 2 at least 7 kg cm , especially preferably at least 15 kg cm2. There is no particular upper limit to the carbon dioxide pressure, but from an economical viewpoint, the reaction can be carried out wiht the desired result at a carbon 2 dioxide pressure of not more than 200 kg cm , usually not 2 more than 100 kg cm2. It is necessary that the reaction medium and the mixture of potassium ss naphtholate and ss naphthol should be liquid under the reaction conditions.The amount of the reaction medium, therefore, can vary according to the reaction conditions, especially the reaction temperature and the pressure of carbon dioxide.Usually, it is at least 0.5 times the weight of potassium B naphtholate, preferably 0.5 to 10 times, especially preferably 0.5 to 5 times, the weight of the latter. Larger amounts of the reaction medium may be used, but better results in regard to the yield of the desired product cannot be obtained correspondingly. Rather, it is economically disadvantageous, and not beneficial to the work up of the reaction mixture. Accordingly, the amount of the reaction medium is preferably not more than 10 times the weight of the potassium 8 naphtholate. The reaction medium performs the action of forming the starting mixture which is liquid under the reaction conditions, the action of adjusting the concentration of B naphthol in the reaction system and thus increasing the rate of the carboxylation reaction, and the action of inhibiting the increasing of the viscosity of the reaction system to be caused by monopotassium 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylate. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the work up is carried out in the following manner. Water is added to the reaction mixture after the reaction to separate it into a reaction medium layer and an aqueous layer. The reaction medium layer is separated, and ss naphthol is extracted from the aqueous layer using a hydrophobic extracting solvent which is preferably liquid at 0 110 C or below. As necessary, prior to the extraction, a tarry layer containing ss naphthol and a resinous material 0 is sedimented in liquid form, preferably at 80 to 100 C, and separated. Preferably, the separated tarry layer is washed with water, and the washing is added together with water to the reaction mixture after the reaction. Examples of suitable extracting solvents include hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, hexane and cyclohexane halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, dichloroethane a nd chloroform nitrated hydrocarbons such as nitrobenzene and nitromethane ethers such as dibutyl ether and diphenyl ether ketones such as cyclohexanone, diisobutyl ketone and acetophenone and alcohols having at least 4 carbon atoms such as n butyl alcohol, n octyl alcohol and 2 ethylhexyl alcohol. The extraction is carried out at a temperature 0 of preferably 30 to 110 C, especially preferably 50 to 1000C, by using the extracting solvent in an amount preferably 0.3 to 2 times, especially preferably 0.5 to 1.5 times, the volume of the aqueous layer. Preferably, ss naphthol in the reaction medium layer is recycled as such. ss Naphthol in the extracting solvent layer left after the separation of the reaction medium layer and the tarry layer is preferably recovered as a potassium hydroxide solution. ss Naphthol in the extracting solvent layer without the separation of the tarry layer, or in the tarry layer is recovered by vacuum distillation, etc.The recovered aqueous potassium 8 naphtholate solution and ss naphthol can be recycled for reuse to the starting material preparing step. This extracting operation also results in the removal of a trace of the reaction medium in the aqueous solution. Then, in order to separate the desired product from the aqueous layer, the aqueous layer after the extraction is adjusted to pH 1 3, preferably 1.5 2.5, and precipitated with an acid, if required after adjusting its pH to 4 to 6 and collecting 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6carboxylic acid by filtration. 2 Hydroxynaphthalene 3carboxylic acid is obtained in a substantially pure form or as a mixture with 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid. When it is necessary to separate the mixture into the constituent acids, it may, for example, be washed or recrystallized by using an organic solvent or a watercontaining organic solvent. The process of this invention can be practised either batchwise or continuously. The reaction and the work up in a preferred embodiment of this invention are specifically described below with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a diagram showing the steps of the process of this invention when it is practised continuously. A mixture consisting of potassium B naphtholate, 6 naphtol and the reaction medium prepared in a reservoir 1 is sent to a reaction vessel 2 wherein it is reacted at the reaction temperature and carbon dioxide pressure described hereinabove. The residence time is preferably 2 to 10 hours. The reaction mixture from the reaction vessel 2 is preferably cooled by a heat exchanger 3. Then, it is mixed with water fed from W in a water mixing tank 4 with stirring. It is then separated into a reaction medium layer and an aqueous layer in a separating tank 5. ss Naphthol may be recovered from the reaction medium layer upper layer R by using a recovering device not shown .The aqueous layer lower layer from the separating tank 5 is adjusted to pH 6.5 8 in a pH adjusting tank 6 by adding an acid from A, and sent to an extracting device 7 which is preferably a centrifugal extracting device where it is extracted with a hydrophobic extracting solvent supplied from S. ss Naphthol can be recovered from the extracting solvent layer withdrawn from E, by using a recovering device not shown . The aqueous layer from the extracting device 7 is sent to an acid precipitation tank 8, and precipitated with an acid added from A. The precipitate is separated by a centrifugal separator 9.The crystals obtained in the centrifugal separator are substantially pure 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid or a mixture of it with 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid. The mixture is separated, as required, into the individual acids using an alcohol, etc. Advantageously, the work up of the reaction mixture is carried out at a substantially constant temperature 0 preferably in the range of 80 to 100 C. For this purpose, an ordinary thermal insulating or heating device may be used. The aqueous potassium ss naphtholate solution and B naphthol recovered from the reaction medium layer, the extracting solvent layer and the tarry layer which is separated as necessary are recycled to the starting material preparing step. The reaction medium and extracting solvent which have been separated are recycled respectively to the dehydrating device not shown and the extracting device 7 for re use. According to the process of this invention, the yield of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid is usually increased to at least 80 after a reaction period of 2 to 10 hours. The total yield of it and the by product 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid reaches at least 85 .The ratio of the two acids can be properly adjusted, and the proportion of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid formed can be increased by adjusting the amount of free 3 naphthol to a relatively large value or the carbon dioxide pressure to a relatively high value. The total yield of the two acids based on the consumed ss naphthol exceeds 90 , and the ratio of g naphthol recovered is over 95 . The reaction media used in this invention are relatively inexpensive, and readily available. In the process of this invention, it is not necessary to distill off B naphthol freed during the reaction, but it can be re used by recovering it as described hereinabove. The process of this invention is very advantageous in regard to thermal economy because the reaction medium and the extracting solvent can be recycled for re use without the need for heating and cooling steps such as fractional distillation.Moreover, since there is scarcely any loss of the reaction medium and the extracting solvent by deterioration or otherwise, the ratio of these materials recovered is more than 99.5 . The process of this invention is also advantageous in regard to thermal economy because the separation of the reaction medium layer, the extraction of the aqueous layer and the optional separation of the tarry layer after the reaction can be carried out at much the same temperature.The process of this invention is very advantageous industrially in that the entire steps for the production of 2hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid from ss naphthol can be continuously carried out.
