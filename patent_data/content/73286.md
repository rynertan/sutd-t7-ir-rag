## Description
Variable speed transmission for motor vehicles The present invention relates to a device for transmitting motion from the driving shaft to the axle shafts of the two driven wheels of a motor vehicle through a stepless speed variator with expandable pulleys, comprising a drive shaft driven by the driving shaft a hollow main shaft rotatably mounted on the drive shaft and carrying an expendable driving pulley an epicyclic reversing unit for transmitting motion from the drive shaft to the main shaft under conditions of forward movement, idling, and rearward movement a driven shaft carrying an expandable driven pulley which is driven by the driving pulley through a V belt hydraulic actuating means for controlling the expansion of the expendable driving and driven pulleys a gear reduction unit driven by the driven shaft, and a differential gear driven by the gear reduction unit and driving the two axle shafts of the vehicle.The object of the present invention is to provide a transmission device of the type specified above which is both simple to construct and has a much reduced size and limited weightIn order to achieve this object, the present invention provides a transmission device of the aforesaid type, which is characterised in that the epicyclic reversing unit comprises a fixed support structure an input sun wheel carried by the drive shaft an output sun wheel carried by the main shaft a planet carrier a plurality of pairs of meshed planet wheels rotatable on pins carried by the planet carrier, one wheel of each pair meshing with the input sun wheel and the other wheel of each pair meshing with the output sun wheel a first hydraulically operated friction clutchoperable to render the planet carrier rigid with the drive shaft, and a second hydraulically operated friction clutch operable to render the planet carrier rigid with the fixed support structure. The presence of the two friction clutches allows the elimination of the hydraulic coupling normally present at the input of the variator in transmissions of this type, resulting in a considerable reduction in size, and reductions in weight and manufacturing costs.Moreover, the type of epicyclic train used in the reversing unit according to the invention avoids the use of the internally toothed annulus normally present in these units, which results in a considerable reduction in the manufacturing costs. Furthermore, the gears of the epiclyclic train used in the reversing unit according to the invention have low speeds of rotation, which allows high reliability to be achieved and reduces maintenance costs.Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will emerge from the following description, provided purely by way of non limiting example, with reference to the appended drawings, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal axial section of a transmission device according to the invention,Figure 2 is a section on an enlarged scale along the line Il Il in Figure 1, andFigure 3 is a schematic illustration of the gears used in the epicyclic reversing unit according to the section line Ill Ill in Figure 2. Indicated by 1 is the end of the driving shaft of a motor vehicle, to which is fixed an annular flywheel 2 with an internally disposed vibration damper 2a having an internally splined hub 2b.The splined end 3a of a drive shaft 3 which constitutes the input shaft of an epicyclic reversing unit, generally indicated 4, is engaged in the hub 2b.The input sun wheel of the reversing unit is indicated 5, and is formed in one piece with the drive shaft 3.To the end of the shaft 3 opposite the splined part 3a is fixed an annular element 6 which surrounds the shaft 3 coaxially and has a channel section with axially extending sides. The annular element 6 has an annular appendage 6a which projects radially and is fixed to the shaft 3.In the part adjacent its bottom, the annular element 6 forms an annular cylinder in which is slidable an annular piston 7 operated hydraulically by oil which is fed under pressure from a gear pump P driven by the shaft 3 near its splined end 3a.The piston 7 operates a multiple disc friction clutchThe discs of the friction clutch 8 are interposed between the periphery of the outer wall of the annular element 6 and a first annular axial flange 9a of a planet carrier 9 which surrounds the shaft 3.A second multiple disc friction clutch 10 has discs which are interposed between a second annular axial flange 9b of the planet carrier 9 and a cylindrical part 12b forming part of the support structure 12 of the reversing unit 4.The friction clutch 10 is operated by an annular control piston 11 which is slidably mounted in an annular cylinder 12a formed in the support structure 12.The planet carrier 9 carries three pairs of meshed planet wheels 13, 14 which are rotatable on respective pins 15, 16.One wheel 13 of each pair meshes with the input sun wheel 5, while the other wheel 14 meshes with the output sun wheel 17 formed in one piece with an end of a tubular main shaft 18 which is rotatably mounted on the drive shaft 3The main shaft 18 carries an expendable driving pulley 19 comprising a half pulley 19a formed in one piece with the shaft 18, and a half pulley 19b slideably keyed onto the shaft 18.An hydraulic actuator 19c is operated in known manner by oil under pressure and is arranged to control the expansion of the pulley 19.The pulley 19 transmits motion through a belt 20 to an expandable driven pulley 21 mounted on a driven shaft 22.The pulley 21 comprises a half pulley 21a formed in one piece with the shaft 22 and a half pulley 21b slidably keyed onto the shaft 22. The expansion of the pulley 21 is controlled by an hydraulic actuator 21c. The driven shaft 22 transmits motion through a gear reduction unit 23, 24, 25, 26 to a differential gear 27 which drives the two axle shafts 28, 29 of the two driven wheels of the motor vehicle.The transmission described above operates as follows.When the friction clutch 8 is operated by the piston 7, the planet carrier 9 is rendered rigid with the drive shaft 3, and hence with the input sun wheel 5, to achieve forward movement of the vehicle. If, however, the friction clutch 10 is engaged by means of the piston 11, the planet carrier 9 is rendered rigid with the fixed support structure 12, thus achieving rearward movement.When both the friction clutches 8, 10 are disengaged, the planet carrier 9 freewheels and motion is not trans ferred from the input sun wheel 5 to the output sun wheel 17 of the epicyclic train, thus achieving idling conditions.The selective operation of the friction clutches 8, 10 is effected in known manner through control means, not shown, including a manual selector which controls a distributor governing the flow of oil supplied by the pump P to the two annular cylinders in which the pistons 7, 11 are movable.
