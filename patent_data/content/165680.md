## Description
TITLE A METHOD OF PRODUCING A STRIP WITH AN EMBOSSED FINISH DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a method of producing a strip with an embossed finish. Various proposals have been made for providing an embossed finish on a strip of material, for example a metal strip.For example one can simply apply an embossing to the metal itself so that a design is impressed into one face of the metal strip and it appears on the other face in reverse form.The problem with such a method is that one cannot satisfactorily apply a delicate or low relief embossing to the strip.Also the standard embossing of metal itself requires expensive, heavy tools and machinery. Another suggestion which has been made is to form a laminate of metal and plastic, and to apply the embossing to the plastics material. The problem with this arrangement is that the plastic memory of the plastic material causes the embossing to disappear, at least in part, with the passage of time. It is now proposed, according to the present invention, to provide a method of producing a strip with an embossed finish, having a given maximum embossing depth, said method comprising applying to one face of the strip a thermoplastic adhesive layer of a thickness greater than said given depth, and to the face of the adhesive layer, a metal foil or metallized foil, heating at least the thermoplastic adhesive sufficiently to soften the thermoplastic adhesive and apply ing the embossing formation to the foil from the face of the foil remote from the adhesive, so that the deformation is taken up completely within the thickness of the thermoplastic adhesive, without affecting the strip and cooling the resulting product to harden the adhesive. With such a method it is possible to produce an embossed finish which can be of a significant depth or can be relatively delicate and of low relief, and this design is retained substantially permanently. Furthermore, because the deformation takes place completely within the thickness of the thermoplastic adhesive, which could be of the type called hotmelt , there is no deformation at all of the strip material itself. It is very often advantageous to have the embossed finsih only on one face of the strip being treated for various aesthetic and practical reasons. This is fully possible with the method according to the present invention. The method according to the present invention enables one to finish up with a metal appearance finish on the embossed surface of the strip material which itself may either be metal, such as aluminium strip, as for example, used in venetian blinds, lamp reflectors, building panels, etc., or could itself be a plastics material. The foil and the adhesive may be supplied as a laminate, the adhesive face of laminate being. applied to the strip. While the heating can be applied at any time, in a pre ferred arrangement, the strip is heated prior to the application of the foil s or laminate. Where the strip is a metal strip, this heating may, for example, be carried out while the strip is passing through a furnace used to cure paint which has previously been applied to the strip. Instead of applying the foil and the adhesive as a laminate, the thermoplastic adhesive, the foil and the strip can be applied separately and joined by pressing them together with a pressure means, one of which is formed by an embossing roll or plate. In that case the adhesive may be applied as a liquid coating or as a film. If applied as a liquid coating such could be done on the metal strip just before the metal strip is heated in an oven. After such heating the metal foil is applied and together formed into a laminate by passing through rolls etc. The foil may be provided, on its face remote from the adhesive, with a transparent protective film, such as a polyester film. In fact the foil may be a metallized foil formed by a protective film having a metallized layer, the foil being applied with the metallized layer facing the adhesive. The thickness of the thermoplastic adhesive layer is advantageously between 20 and 500 p, and preferably between 30 and 200 p. The embossing deformation will, of course, be less than the thickness of the adhesive and is preferably between 2 and 180 p. Where the strip is a metal strip, it is preferably heated to a temperature of between 100 and 2000C. The embossing deformation may be carried out by means of a forming roll or plate, the temperature of which is significantly below the softening point of the thermoplastic adhesive which had, of course, previously been heated to a temperature above its softening point prior to the application of the deforming roll or plate there against. The thickness of the metallized foil or metal foil is desirably between 10 and 40 p. The invention also provides a strip with an embossed finish produced by the method of the invention and a product including one or more such strips. In order that the invention may more readily be understood, the following descr pion is given, merely by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic cross section through a metal strip provided with an embossed finish by the method of the invention Figure 2 is a schematic view of one embodiment of apparatus for carrying out the method of the invention Figure 3 is a view similar to Figure 2 of a further form of apparatus. Referring first to Figure 1, there is illustrated therein a strip 10 of metal to which is applied a thermoplastic adhesive 12 having thereabove a metal foil 14. This foil is deformed from the face thereof remote from the adhesive 12 by a suitable defcrming means to be desCribed below and the deformations are indicated at 16. It will be seen that the deformations 16 are of a depth which is less than the thickness of the adhesive 12 so that the deformations are taken up completely within the thickness of the thermoplastic adhesive, without affecting the strip material 10 therebelow. Thus the lower face 17 of the strip 10 is completely smooth and is not in any way affected by the deformations 16. The strip 10 may be formed from aluminium, steel or even from a plastic material. The thermoplastic adhesive can be of any suitable type compatible with the strip and compatible with the foil 14, and can have a thickness between 20 and 5000 p and preferably of between 30 and 200 p. The foil 14 can be a pure metal foil, or can be a metal foil reinforced with a polyester film on its upper surface, as seen in figure 1, or can indeed be a metallized polyester film with the lower surface, that is the surface in contact with the adhesive, having been premetallized onto the film.In either event the film is preferably of a transparent nature so that the metal effect appears through the transparent film. One method of producing the strip is indicated inFigure 2. The metal strip 10 is passed through an oven or furnace 20, which may, if desired, be the furnace used to cure paint which has previously been applied to the strip. A composite film 22 consisting of the metal foil 13 and a thermoplastic film 12 is unwound from a reel 24 thereof and fed between a pair of rolls 26, 28. The roll 26 is a heated roll which may be heated to a temperature of say, 100 to 2000C and the roll 28, which is applied against the metal foil, is a cooled embossing roll 28 which serves both to impart the embossing deformation to the metal foil, so that it is taken up fully in the thermoplastic adhesive as described above, and also to laminate, together with the roll 26, the composite film to the strip 10.The laminated structure may then pass through a cooling zone 30 so that it is cooled to room temperature and the thermoplastic adhesive is hardened to maintain the embossed deformation of the foil. Figure 3 indicates a similar arrangement and like parts have been indicated by like reference numerals. However, instead of the composite film 22 a thermoplastic film 12 is unwound from a roll 32 and a metal foil 14 is unwound from a roll 34 before passing between the rolls 26, 28. It is also contemplated that the thermoplastic layer could be coated onto the strip 10 in a separate operation, that is to say before the metal foil is brought into contact therewith at the rolls 26, 28. It is also contemplated that the metal foil could be in the form of metallizing on a backing film, for example a polyester film which is preferably transparent. Similarly, even when the metal foil is a foil in its own right, a protective reinforcing film, again for example of polyester and transparent, can be applied to the face of the metal foil remote from the adhesive and secured thereto by a further adhesive material.
