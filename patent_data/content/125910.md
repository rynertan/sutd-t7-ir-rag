# Process for production of 4 methyl 1 pentene polymer or copolymer.

## Abstract
Polymerization of 4 methyl 1 pentene or copolymeriza tion of 4 methyl 1 pentene with up to about 20 mole of an olefin having 2 to 20 carbon atoms in the presence of a catalyst comprising A a solid highly active titanium catalyst component composed of magnesium, titanium, halogen and a diester of a dicarboxylic acid, B an organoaluminum compound, and C an organosilicon compound represented by the fol lowing formula R¹₃Si OR² wherein each of R¹ and R² represents a hydrocarbon group with 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and the three R¹ groups may be identical or different, wherein, prior to the polymerization or copolymerization, a methylpentene is pre polymerized or pre copolymerized in the presence of a catalyst comprising the catalyst component A , a part of the catalyst component B and a part of the catalyst component C to form about 1 to about 1000 grams, per millimole of titanium atom, of a methylpentene polymer or copolymer.
