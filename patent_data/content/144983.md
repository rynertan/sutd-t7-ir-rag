# Process for preparing polyacrylonitrile articles having high tensile strength and modulus.

## Abstract
Polyacrylonitrile articles, such as filaments, tapes and films, having high tensile strength and modulus, and pre pared by adding to a solution of polyacrilontrile with a molecular weight above 3 x 10⁵, pref. above 5 x 10⁵, a minor amount of a bivalent metal compound, converting the solution into a solvent containing article, cooling this article to form a gelarticle, removing from this gel the solvent and metal compound, and stretching the resulting article at increased temperature. With this process filaments with a tensile strength above 1.2 GPa and a modulus above 16 GPa can be obtained.
