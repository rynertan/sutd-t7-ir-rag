# Control apparatus for a vehicle window motor.

## Abstract
A control apparatus for a vehicle window driving motor 32 in an H switch semiconductor bridge with a silicon controlled rectifier 34,35 and a field effect transistor 36,37 in each opposite armature current path includes control logic circuitry enabling one touch actuation of window movement in either direction with stoppage by actuating either actua tion device 11,12 and with flip flop 27,29 control of the bridge elements to prevent shorting out the power supply. A variation provides automatic stoppage in the up direction by stall current sensing with automatic reverse after a time delay to allow the SCR conducting during upward movement to turn off.
