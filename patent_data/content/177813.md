# Immunological assay method.

## Abstract
Immunological fluorometric assay method, wherein an an tigen 1 attached to magnetic particles 3 reacts in a liquid with an antibody 2 present in the sample and with an antibody 4 marked with a fluorescent substance. After the reaction, the particles are pulled by means of a magnetic field through a second 6 liquid layer onto the bottom of the measurement vessel, whereupon the particles are excited, and emitted radia tion is collected through the wall of the vessel.
