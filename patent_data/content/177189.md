# Polymerization catalyst.

## Abstract
An olefin polymerization catalyst produced by treating a inert porous support material preferably a hydrated high surface area silica support having 1.00 to 1.50 hydroxyls per gram of silica with the reaction product of an organomagne sium compound and first a hafnium compound then a halogenator and tetravalent titanium compound, which when used as a cocatalyst with an organoaluminum com pound produces polymers having broad molecular weight distribution.
