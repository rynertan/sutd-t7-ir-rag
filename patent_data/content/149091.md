## Description
Impact modified Polycarbonates The present invention is directed to a thermoplastic molding composition comprising a blend of i about 80 to 97 by weight, referred to the sum of 1 ii of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and of ii about 3 to 20 by weight, referred to the sum of i ii , of a polyether ester amide random copolymer of a at least one omega aminocarboxylic acid or lactam having at least 10 carbon atoms, b at least one polymeric diol having an average degree of polymerization of between 2 and 42 and c at least one organic dicarboxylic acid, said copolymer being further characterized in that said a relates by weight to the total of said b said c as between 30 70 and 98 2, preferably between 50 50 and 95 5 and especially between 60 40 and 90 10, and further in that the hydroxy groups of said b and the carboxy groups of said c are present in equivalent amounts. According to US Patent 3839245 polyether ester amide are known which are suitable as antistatic agents for polyester, polyamides and other fiber forming polymers. Thermoplastic polycarbonates are not involved. According to US Patent 4218549 polyether ester amides are useful as blending components for polyamides improving cold impact strength and flexibility. According to US Patent 4309518 poly ethylene terephthalates are modified with polyether ester amides thus improving the notched impact strength of the poly alkylene terephthalates . Nevertheless it was unobvious to use polyetherester amides for impact and critical thickness improving of thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates because polycarbonate polyamide blends usually tend to decreased impact strength, caused by incompatability and degradation of the polycarbonate. However, using polyetheresteramides as blendpartner for polycarbonate no decrease of 1 8 notched Izod impact strength and a strong increase of the 1 4 n Izod impact strength as well as critical thickness was observed. Impact strength dependence on thickness gives rise to critical thickness , a material parameter defined as that thickness at which a discontinuity occurs in the graphical representation of impact strength vs. specimen thickness. For example, polycarbonate based on bisphenol A, having a melt flow rate of 3 to 6 grams l0 minutes at 3000C ASTM D 1238 exhibits a discontinuity at about 5.71 mm 225 mils . Articles of this material thinner than 225 mils will show ductile failure upon impact while thicker ones will fail in a brittle fashion. This dependence of impact performance on thickness represents a drawback because it tends to limit the utility of polycarbonates by imposing restrictions on thedesign of molded articles. Among the approaches to solving the critical thickness problem the art discloses the incorporation of polyolefin into the polycarbonate resin see U.S.Patent 3,437,631 . Another approach, taught by U.S.Patent 4,043,980, entails the introduction of sulfur containing aromatic diols into the polycarbonate chains. The art is also noted to include U.S.4,299,928 where acrylated based graft elastomers useful in modifying the impact performance of polycarbonate resins are disclosed.1. The Polycarbonates In the present context, polycarbonate resins are those having a molecular weight weight average of about 10,000 to about 200,000, preferably about 20,000 to about 80,000, and may be alternatively characterized as having a melt flow rate per ASTM D 128 at 300doc, of about 1 to about 24 guns 10 minutes, preferably about 2 6 gum 70 minutes. Among the useful dihydroxy compounds for preparing the aromatic polycarbonates in the practice of the invention are hydroquinone, resorcinol, bis hydroxyphenyl alkanes, bis hydroxyphenyl cycloalkanes, bis hydroxyphenyl ethers, bis hydroxyphenyl ketones, bis hydroxyphenyl sulfoxides, bis hydroxyphenyl sulfones and alpha, alpha bis hydroxyphenyl diisopropyl benzenes. These and further suitable aro matic dihydroxy compounds are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,028,365 2,999,835 3,271,367 and 2,999,846, in German Offenlegungsschriften German Published Specifications 1,570,703, 2,063,050, 2,063,052, 2,211,956 and 2,211,957, in French PatentSpecification 1,561,518 and in the monograph H.Schnell, Chemistry and Physics of Polycarbonates,Interscience Publishers, New York, 1964. Further examples of suitable bisphenols are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A , 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy phenyl 2 methyl butane, 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexane, alpha, alpha bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pdiisopropyl benzene, 2, 2 bis 3 chloro 4 hydroxy phenyl propane, hydroxybenzophenone and 4,4 sulfonyl diphenol. The most preferred bisphenol is 2,2 bis 4hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A . The polycarbonates of the invention may entail in their structure, units derived from one or more of the suitable bisphenols The preparation of polycarbonate resins may be carried out in accordance with any of the processes known in the art, for example, by the interfacial polycondensation process, polycondensation in a homogeneous phase or by transesterification. The suitable pro cesses and the assotiated reactants, catalysts, solvents and conditions are known in the art. In the preparation of the polycarbonate resins of the invention, monofunctional reactants such as monophenols are advantageously used in order to limit their respective molecular weights. Also branching agents may optionally be employed. Branching may be obtained by the incorporation of small amounts, preferably of between about 0.05 and 2.0 mol relative to diphenols employed , of trifunctional of more than trifunctional compounds, for example compounds having three or more phenolic hydroxyl groups. Polycarbonates of this type are known in the art. Some examples of compounds with three or more than three phenolic hydroxy groups which can be used are phloroglucinol, 1,4,5 tri 4 hydroxyphenyi benzene, 1,1 ,1 tri 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane, tri 4 hydroxyphenyl phenylmethane, 2,2 bisL4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl cyclohexyl7 propane, 2 4 hydroxy phenyl 2 2,4 dihydroxyphenyl propane, tetra 4 hydroxyphenyl methane, tetra 4 4 hydroxy phenylisopropyl phenoxy methane and 1 , 4 bis 4,4 dihydroxytriphenyl methyl benzene. Some of the other trifunctional compounds are 2,4 dihydroxybenzoic acid, trimesic acid, cyanuric chloride and 3,3 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methyl phenyl 2 oxo 2,3 dihydroindole. 2.
