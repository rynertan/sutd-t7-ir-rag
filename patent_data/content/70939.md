# Snap in anti reverse selector.

## Abstract
An actuator 150 for an anti reverse device which is extended through a sleeve in a reel housing and snap fit thereto. An elongate body 412 with a head 432 and a bifurcated end defines first 415 and second 416 portions which are assembled in the reel from the exterior of the housing. The first portion engages the anti reverse device. The second portion is fabricated from a resilient material and includes a lip 420 depending from adjacent its inward edge. The second portion is urged toward the first portion as the body is captured within the opening in the reel housing. With the actuator fully seated the lip engages the inside wall 450 and in conjunction with the head 432 captures the wall so as to retain the actuator. A protrusion 428 on the radial outer face of the second portion engages the wall of the opening to resiliently load the respective first and second portions in the opening and engages on one of two detents to position the actuator in one of two setting positions.
