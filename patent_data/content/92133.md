# Circular knitting machine incorporating a device for renewing a needle selection at at least one yarn feed.

## Abstract
A single or double cylinder circular knitting machine is adapted to effect renewal of a needle selection at one or more successive yarn feeds F without requiring a respec tive pattern selection device therefor. The pattern jacks 3 which have been selected, by a preceding pattern selection device 2 , not to bring their respective needles 4 to knit are moved radially inwards by a guiding cam 17 , and are held separated from the other jacks 3 even after the latter have brought their respective needles 4 to knit. The cam 17 may have a first movable part 18 and a second fixed part 19 . At one position of the movable part 18 , the inoperative jacks 3 are moved radially to the inside of the fixed part 19 , and at the second position thereof, radially to the outside thereof, thereby they are restored to the selection position. This allows operation with a program med selection even where the selection was formerly just reiterated.
