# Herbicidal sulfonamides.

## Abstract
Sulfonamide derivatives of the formula CHEM wherein J is an aromatic or heteroaromatic group bearing a cyclic substituent W is O or S R is H or CH3 A is a mono or bicyclic heterocyclic residue e.g. pyrimidinyl or triazinyl and their agriculturally suitable salts, exhibit herbicidal activity. Some also show a plant growth regulant effect. The novel compounds may be made by a variety of techniques, e.g. by reacting a suitable sulfonyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate JNCW with an appropriate heterocyclic amine ANHR.
