# Silicone elastomer composition.

## Abstract
A silicone elastomer composition which has novel crosslinking points comprises A 100 parts by weight of a polyorganosiloxane of a polymerisation degree of at least 20, wherein the organic groups are selected from monovalent substituted and unsubstituted hydrocarbon groups and are attached to silicon atoms, and at lest two of the organic groups are monovalent hydrocarbon groups possessing at least five carbon atoms and a carbon carbon double bond bonded to a silicon atom via at least one carbon atom, B 5 to 200 parts by weight of an inorganic filler having a specific surface area of at least 50 mÂ² g, and C 0.1 to 25 parts by weight of a vulcanizer selected from the group consisting of sulfur, sulfur donor, substituted or unsubsittuted alkylphenol resins, and quinoids.
