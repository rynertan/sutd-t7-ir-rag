# APPARATUS FOR INDICATING THE POSITION OF A MEMBER

## Abstract
Apparatus is provided in which a code is carried by a member whose position it is desired to determine and is read by detecting means as the member moves to give an indication of its position at any one time. The member 1 has a disc 3 attached to move with it. The disc 3 has two tracks on it, a pseudo random code track 8 and a timing code track 4. Read heads 5, 6, 9 and 10 read the tracks thereby defining the position of the member 1. The signals from the read heads 5, 6, 9 and 10 are processed in a processing circuit PC to give the position of the member 1. The position is displayed at 2 which also provides a control for the member 1.
