# PROTOZOAL ANTIGEN

## Abstract
Protection inducing antigens of parasites of the genus Plasmodium is described. The antigens have an apparent molecular weight of 2.0 to 2.6 10‚Åµ and are associated with a localised region of the erythrocytic merozoite forms of the parasite. The antigens may be incorporated into vaccines and used for the inducing of immunity into susceptible vertebrate hosts including humans. Methods for the prepara tion of the antigens are also described.
