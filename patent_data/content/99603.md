# Semiconductor device and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device comprising a semiconductor body 1 having a surface 2 provided with a first insulating layer 3 . On this layer is disposed a pattern of conductor strips 4 coated with insulation strips 5 with projecting edges 6 . Under the edges 6 , the conductor strips 4 are coated with insulating tracks 8 which fill the spaces under the edges 6 and which it least at the area where they adjoin the first insulating layer 3 can be etched selectively with respect to this layer 3 . As a material for the conductor strips 4 use may be made of materials other than polycrystalline silicon, such as tungsten, molybdenum and silicides. The thickness of the first insulating layer 3 is affected to a very small extent during tie manufacture of the device, while its depth remains unchanged.
