## Description
Electric Power System Fault WarningArrangements. This application relates to electric power systems and more particularly to the warning of faults in such systems. In many cases the insulator contamination of high voltage systems represents the main source of troubles in producing loss of power due to faults.Systems faults due to contamination are usually attributed to natural dust or, in industrial areas, to polluted atmospheric conditions. Whilst the latter cause can be, and recently in some countries partially has been, alleviated by the limitation of.such pollution, the occurrence of natural dust is mainly a function of local soil conductivity. Also, in areas where fog occurs, the accumulated dust on the surface of insulators becomes a conducting material. Even in countries where dust contamination is not such a problem, the combination of humidity and salt content in coastal areas may cause problems comparable with those arising from dust deposits from conductive soils. The invention relates to any electric power system including insulators exposed to pollution but has especial application to overhead electric power transmission systems. or such systems techniques have been developed to identify a faulted tower i.e.a tower on which a supported power line has developed a fault due to insulator contamination from a knowledge of the post fault voltages and currents at the switching station feeding the faulted line. The conventional technique is to obtain the current and voltage waveforms from fault recorders at the switching stations. With the superposition of the waveforms from the switching stations feeding the line and the utilisation of sSeclal mathematical tech niques it is possible to locate the faulted tor, but with an error that may cover between three and ten towers depending on the accuracy of the fault recorders and the mathematical procedure. however, due to the tediousness of the mathematical techniques involved, fault recorders are not often used as fault locators. The locating of the faulted tower brings several advantages firstly, the repetition of faults on the same tower may indicate that special attention is required in the form of frequent cleaning or the fitting of extra insulators secondly, a tremendous saving of manpower is achieved in locating and performing the maintenance required thirdly, important statistical data can be obtained for further transmission planning and fourthly, useful information is provided in the case of malfunctioning of protective relays. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fault warning arrangement for use in an electric power system in which the occurrence of a fault in an insulator arrangement of the system can be predicted and wherein the above disadvantages may be overcome. The present invention provides a fault warning arrangement for use in an electric power system characterised by warning means for producing a first signal when the value of the leakage current in an insulator arrangement of the system exceeds a first threshold value. Preferably said warning means also produces a second signal when the value of said insulator leakage current is below a second threshold value, said second signal being representative of the amount by which the value of said insulator leakage current is below said second threshold value. Alternatively said warning means may also produce a second signal when the value of the neutral current of combined insulator leakage currents of all t insulator arrangements in a group, e.g. on the same single circuit tower or at a particular location, associated with different phases of the system exceeds a second threshold value, said second signal being rep resentatlve of the amount by which the value of said neutral current exceeds said second threshold value. Preferably said warning means includes encoding means so arranged that said warning means produces an encoded said first signal or an encoded said first signal and an encoded said second signal. It will be appreciated that said warning means may be arranged to produce a signal indicative of the passing of a threshold value by the value of the insulator leakage current of any one of a plurality of insulator arrangements. In this case it will be appreciated that a single common encoding means may be used. Preferably there is associated with a group ce one or more of said warning means transmitting mean for transmitting a signal produced by any one of the warning means of said group to a switchin station c the system Preferably the signals produced by the or each warning means are optical signal and preferably the optical signals are transmitted to the switching station vla an optical fibre. The optical fibre. may be arranged to be located in an earth conductor of the system, within the conductors of a power line of said system, within a bundle of conductors of said system, or, in an overhead transmission system where the tower.of the system can safely support the extra load, suspended in catenaries from an earth wire of said system, Preferably the or each warning means is arrange to detect the passing of threshold values by values of Insulator leakage current by detecting the pass ing of threshold values by values of total insulator current. Preferably the or each warning means is arranged to be powered by insulator current. The process of flashover in an insulator of an electric power system may tare up to siy hours to develop, depending on the atmosphere and the conanc tivity of the contamination, from the start of the process until the appearance of the arc. Also, the leak age current flowing across the insulator which culmin ates in a flashover, i.e. the appearance of an arc, increases in a substantially linear manner with time.Hence in accordance with the invention a detection of the increase in the leakage current across the insulator above a certain value can be used to predict the occurrence of a flashover. However, apart from the leakage current flowing across the insulator there is also a substantially constant capacitive current flowing through it. case leak age current and the capacitive current, however, are in quadrature, since the capacitance of the insulator and the resistance of the contamination on the insula tor may be considered as forming a parallel RO circuit. Hence,since the pre flashover capacitive current is substantially constant, detection of the increase in the resultant of the leakage current and the capacitive current, i.e. the total insulator current, above a certain value can, in accordance with the invention, be used to predict the occurrence of a flashover. Also, in the instance of a downed conductor, broken conductor or other low insulation fault the voltage across the insulators of the conductor, and hence the total insulator current, falls to a minimum at the insulators immediately adjacent the fault. C alpha detection of the decease In the insulator leakage current below a certain value can be used to locate the position of the fault. In oder that the invention may be better understood, there will now be described, by way if example only, part of an overhead electrical power transmission system according to the invention, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in whiches Figure 1 shows schematically a suspersion tower of the system Figure 2 shows schematically a tension tower of the system Figure 3 shows a more detailed representation of first embodiment of a warning arrangement according to the invention suitable for use in the system Figure 4 showa a more detailed representation of a second embodiment, being a modification of the embodiment of Figure 3, of a warning arran, ment according to the invention suitable for use inne system and Figure 5 shows a signal transmission and coding arrangement suitable for use in the system. The system includes a number of suspension towers as in Figure 1 and a number of tension towers as in Figure 2 form which the power les of the system are supported in conventional manner. On each tower is mounted a warning means which according to the first embodiment includes there detecting apparatuses 10 only one of which is shown in Figures 1 and 2 and an encoding apparatus 11 Referring firstly to figures 1 and an a, detecting apparatus 10 shown more fully in Figure 3 , is associated with each insultor arrangement that supports apower line 3. That detecting apparatus 10 may be connected between the earthy arcing horn 6 in the insulator 5 as shown in Figure 1, or between the earthy arcing horn 5 and earth as shown in Figure 2.An encoding apparatus 11 is provided on each tower 1 or 2 and is preferably located high in the tower s structure conveniently near to the point where the overhead earth conductor 4 is secured to the tower. The overhead earth conductor Is dapted to carry one or more optical fibres 7. Referring now to Figure 3, the detecting apparatus 10 includes a first current level detector 15, a second current level detector 16 and a power source 17 all connected in series via path 18 through which normally the total current of the apparatus associated insulator arrangement is arranged to pass. A changeover switch 19 adapted to give a visual indication of state is also provided. The first current detector 15 detects when the value of the current passing through it exceeds a first predetermined value and upon detection produces a first signal which is applied via conductor 21 to an encoding means 20 which in turn produces a first predeternined optical signal that is conveyed via fibre 22 to an optical repeating means 23. Activat ion of the first current detector 15 de activaves the second current detector 16 and activates the change over switch 19 via path 24 which causes the insulator current to flow along path 25 thus avoiding dam¹e to detectors 15 and 16 and power source 17. The second current detector 16 detects when the value of the current passing through It is below a second predetermined value and upon detection p oduces a second signal, representative of the amount by which the values of the current is below the second predetermined value, which is applied via conductor 26 to the encodIng means 20 which in turn produces a second optical signal which is conveyed via fibre 22 to the optical repeating means 23. A manual, automatic or remotely contur device may be provided, although not shown here, to reset device 19 to direct the total insulator current back through path 18 when axcess insulator current has subsided. Referring noti also to Figure 5 the encoding apparatuses 11 assocIated with the line 3 are divided into n groups each containing m encoding apparatuses.The encoded optical signals output from the m encoding apparatuses 11 of each group are conveyed through optical fibres 22 to a respective one of n repeater units 23. The signals received by each repeater unit are then transmitted via fibre optic cables 7 suspended In catenaries from the earth conductor 4 to switching stations 27 and 28 at either end of the line. At the switching stations a received signal is decoded, thereby locating the encoding means 20 which produced the signal.It will be appreciated that the optical fibres joining the two switching stations 27 and 28 may also be used to communicate between the two switching stations It will thus be apparent that whilst encoding means l is fitted to each tower, only every e th. tower has repeating apparatus 12 fitted thereto. It will also be appreciated that in a double circuit transmission system, a first and a second curr ent detector may, in accordance with the invention, be associated each with one of the two insulator arrangements of each circuit, either of the first current detectors or either on the second current detectors activating a common signal encoding means indicated by paths 31 shown in Figure 3. . Where technically necessary, elements of the system are supplied with power via conductor 30. Referring now to Figure 4, according to a second embodiment of the invention, which embodiment is a modification of the first embodiment shown in Figure 3, changeover apparatus 10 includes a changeover switch 19 adapted to give a visual indication of its state. Detecting and enconding apparatus 11 comprises three first level detectors 15, three power sources 17 and one second level detector 16. in general there may be as many first level detectors 15 as there are power sources 17, the number of each depending on the number of phases per tower, d there is at least one second level detector. For the pu pose of illustration only a signale circuit 3 phase tower arrangement is shown in Figure 4.The three sets of first detector 15 and power supply i7 receive the insulator currents R, Y, 5 which are later grouped to produce a neutral current. The neutral current is then passed through a single second level detector 5v before itreaches earth. Detectors 15 and 50 are activated when the current flowing through them exceeds a first or a second pre determined value respectively. When detector 15 is activated, a first predetermined signal Is passed to encoder 20.When detector 50 is activated a socond signal, represent active of the amount by which the value of the neutral current exceeds said second predetermined value, is pass to encoder 20. Receipt of a first predeter nined signal or second signal by encoder 20 cause a corresponding optical signal to be sent from encoder 20 to repeater 23 via fibre 22. It will be understood that whilst the particular embodiment described above is an overhead electric power transmission system, the invention is applicto any electric power system wherein components of the system, e.g. power lines, switchgear, transformers, etc, aro insulated by arrangements exposed to pollution.
