## Description
TillS INVENTION relates to a binding agent for use in binding powdered, granular, comminuted or similarly divided material together to form larger bodies such as pellets, cakes or the like. The invention is particularly, but not exclusively applicable to the binding together of the components of animal feed materials in pellets. Most dry animal feed supplied to farmers as a compound feed containing a number cf ingredients is presented in pelleted form. The use of this form has a number of beneficial effects. Thus such use simplifies the calculation and administering of balanced feed rations to animals on the farm, prevents segregation of ingredients during processing, transpcrt storage and handling, and minimises losses of finely ground ingredients during handling operations and while animals are feeding. The use of the pelleted form also prevents rejection by the animal of certain ingredients beneficial to the animal but not particularly palatable. When pelleting processes were first introduced it was found that the mi of feedstuff ingredients and the conditions used could be arranged so that binders occurring naturally in one or more of the feed components kept the pellets together reasonably well. As the composition of feedstuffs came to be more closely dictated by commercial and nutritional considerations, however, it was found that the mix so dictated could not also be designed so that the pellets would be held together adequately by the binders occurring naturally in the constituents and so additional binding agents were necessary. A variety of materials have been tried as binding agents, the most popular being clay minerals and lignin sulphonate added as a significant percentage e.g. 1 to 5 of the feed.One disadvantage of these binding agents is that they must, to be effective, form a significant percentage of the pellet material, whilst contributing little to the feed value of the pellet.Clay minerals can also contribute significantly to wear of the extrusion head of the pelleting machine used to form the pellets. Furthermore the current developments in animal feed technology indicate that pellets with a greater proportion of fat than hitherto are required by the industry for optimum animal nutrition and high energy content feed. It is found that an increase in fat content necessitates a further increase in the proportion of conventional binding agent necessary to prevent undue break up of the pellets. The basic technology of the known processes used for making pelleted animal feeds is as follows The major ingredients, for example various types of ground cereal, molasses, fat and protein meal, are mixed thoroughly in a mixing vessel together with any binding agents used. The material then passes through a steam chamber where live steam is injected into the mix. The quantity of steam employed and the time spent in the chamber by the material is monitored and controlled carefully in order to bring the mass to the optimum temperature and water content for the next stage. This next stage is the pelleting process where the feed material is forced under considerable pressure through stainless steel dies to form cylindrical or square section pellets. The temperature of the mix is further increased by the work done during the polleting operation.The feed is then finally cooled and conveyed to storage to await automatic packaging. During the process and as a result of the heating, cooling and pressures exerted on the feed, various changes occur to some of the ingredients. Thus fatty materials may be melted and thus caused to disperse better through the mix and then coolod. Proteinaceous materials may be partly cooked or coagulated, and while this may help to bind the pellet constituents together, it may, if overdone, cause loss of feed value. Starchy materials may start to gel or solubilise, again helping to bind the ingredients together. Changes in the flavour of the ingredients will be induced which will clearly influence the palatability of the finished product to the animal for which it is intended.Close control of the conditions must be maintain ea throughout the process to ensure that the extent of these changes is optimised and a balance must be maintained between the desirable effects of heating, etc. and the deleterious effects ced by overheating. It is an object of one aspect of the invention to provide an improved binding agent, for use in binding powdered, granular, comminuted or similarly divided material, and which is of particular, but not exclusive, utility for binding together the constituents of pellets of animal feed material. According to this aspect of the present invention there is provided a binding agent comprising a mixture of an inorganic binder and a resin binder, for example plaster of Paris and a ulea formaldehyde resin respectively. It is an object Or another aspect of the invention to provide an inoproved method of making up granular, powdered comminuted or otherwise divided material in the form of larger bodies such as pellets or cakes. According to this aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of making up granular, powdered, comminuted or otherwise divided material in the form of larger bodies, comprising mixing with the material a binding agent according to the first mentioned aspect, forming the mixture into said larger bodies and causing the binding agent in the bodies to set by the action of water and a catalyst to promote setting o the plaster of Paris and polymerisation of the urea formaldehyde resin. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a product in the form of a body of granular, powdered, comminuted or the like material bound together by I a binder and formed by the above method according to.the invention. is provided a yet another of making up an animal invention in I pelleted form, comprising mixing together a plurality of nutritional ingredients in powdered, granular, comminuted or the like form, together with a binding agent comprising plaster of Paris in the hemihydrate form, and in the presence of water, forming the mixture into bodies such as pellets or cakes, and allowing the bodies to set. The invention, of course, also extends to pelleted or the like animal feedstuffs formed by the last mentioned method. Various features of preferred embodiments of the invention will appear from the following description and examples, relating to animal feedstuff. The binding agent preferred for binding the ingredients of animal feedstuff in pelleted form is a product comprising a mixture of plaster of Paris, i.e. the hemihydrate of calcium sulphate, with an incompletely polymerised ureaformaldehyde resin and a catalyst therefor. Both of these components, i.e. the plaster of Paris and the urea formalde hyde resin, are hardening agents in their own right but when used together a synergistic effect results. The reaction of plaster of Paris with water is well knout, thus the hemihydrate of calcium sulphate, Ca So4 1120g when mixed with water evolves heat and solidifies to gyps,Ca So4 21I20 The type of urea formaldehyde resin employed is that common ly used in glues for wood or other materials. Thus the polymerisation reaction between urea and formaldehyde is not carried to completion during production of the resin and to the resulting powdered product a dry catalyst is added such that when water is mixed with the product the catalyst is activated and the full polymerisation and cross linking results in a hard polymer with excellent binding properties.In the production of polleted animal feed using this binding agent, the overall process used is the same as that referred to above as comprising the basic technology of the known processes. The reaction of the plaster of Paris with water takes place rapidly during the process sld is accelerated by the heating effect as the pellet is extruded. Similarly the activation of the catalyst occurs during extrusion of the pellets and the polymer produced bonds the particles of feed together. Application trials have indicated that the plaster ofParis urea formaldehyde mixture, when used at the rate of O,ldp to 0.3 only, yields pellets with properties similar to those obtained using ten times as much conventional binding agents. In addition when high fat or high molasses formulations were employed to the surface of the pellet was found to be much less sticky with the new binder than when the conventional agents were used. The proportion of plaster of Paris in the binding agent before reaction and setting is preferably between 1 3 and 2 3 by weight. In each of the tables headed Example A and ExampleB set out bellow are given the composition under columnAl in Example A and under column B1 in Example B of a respective feed mix incorporating a conventional binder, and the corresponding hardness of the pellets produced and the composition under column A2 in Example A ind under columnB2 in Example B of an equivalent feed mix incorporating the preferred plaster of Paris urea formaldehyde binder referred to previously, and the corresponding hardness of the pellets produced. The pellets in each case were produced by the method previously indicated. The effectiveness of the binders in the examples given was compared primarily by the estimation of the average hardness of a sample of the pellets produced, using a Kahl hardness tester.This method is the one commonly used in the industry. In Example A the fced ration is typical of a high energy, high molasses formula and Example B corresponds to a high fat formula.
