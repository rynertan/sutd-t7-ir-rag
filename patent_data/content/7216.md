# Container for pressurized products.

## Abstract
A container for pressurized products wherein the con tainer is formed of first and second container halves joined in a generally mid height peripheral seam. Under abusive handl ing, the seam could rupture and failure may occur. A shrunk plastics material film wrapper is applied along the central portion of the container in overlying relation to the peripheral seam and serves to permit controlled venting of the pressure from within the container in the event of such failure of the container per se.
