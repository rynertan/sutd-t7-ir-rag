## Description
This invention relates to pesticides for use in agriculture and horticulture, including the treatment of ornamental and crop plants. More particularly and indeed exclusively, it is concerned with the use as a pesticide of sodium metabisulphite, which has previously been used in food and drink preservation and for sterilization of utensils in the food and brewing industries. Sodium metabisulphite is capable of releasing sulphur dioxide. Sodium propionate and sodium ascorbate have also been so used. None of these compounds has hitherto been used in controlling fungal or bacterial infection in growing plants, whether grown for crop production or for ornamental purposes. In accordance with the present invention, sodium metabisulphite is used to kill pests on growing crop and ornamental plants by application to the plants. It may be used in conjunction with sodium propionate and or sodium ascorbate. The effect of these three materials lasts only for a short time, sometimes as little as ten minutes, under agricultural conditions. However, such materials are readily available and inexpensive, are permitted food additives and are non specific fungicides and bactericides, so that the establishment of resistance to them is unlikely. Used by itself at rates from 5 grams to 2.5 kg per hectare, sodium metabisulphite can offer a degree of fungal or bacterial control which is commercially useful in relating to its cost. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is based on the discovery that sodium metabisulphite, possibly in association with sodium propionate and or sodium ascorbate, can be made into useful pesticide compositions particularly fungicides and bactericides of enhanced efficacy, persistance and rainfastness by also incorporating a coating agent into the composition. Such compositions may have a life of 2 hours or so and can usefully sterilize the leaf and surfaces of plants. The preferred coating agent that can be used in accordance with the invention is di 1 Apart from monoterpenes, the following compounds are suitable, though this is not an exhaustive list Sodium metabisulphite may be used with or without a coating agent in combination with fungicides or bacteriocides commonly used for such purposes in crop plants such as carbendazim, chlorothalonil, propiconazole, triadimefon and benomyl United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Ref Book 380 84 . A surface active agent, e.g. nonyl phenol ethylene oxide condensate, may also be applied with the fungicide or bactericide, in the presence or absence of a coating agent. The following Examples illustrate the method and compositions of the present invention. Four aqueous formulations were made up. The first two contained, on a w v basis, the following ingredients. Formulations 1A and 2A corresponded respectively to each of Formulations 1 and 2, but each of them also contained, on a v v basis, 0.25 of di 1 The formulations were used to control powdery mildew Erisiphe graminis on spring barley, var. Triumph . The plants were sprayed as soon as mildew development was seen. The plants were scored from 0 no control to 10 100 control two weeks later.
