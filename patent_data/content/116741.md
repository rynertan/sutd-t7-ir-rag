## Description
STORAGE CONTAINER THIS INVENTION relates to storage containers and more particularly to such containers for the storage of files and the like. In many offices the storage of box files, lever arch files and the like presents a problem.Many files do not stand for extended periods by themselves and thus ordinary shelves are not suitable and shelves with partitions have to be provided.This requires special installations which are naturally expensive. An object of this invention is to provide an inexpensive means for storing files. According to the invention a container for storing files and the like comprises a substantially rectangular container of suitable cardboard, the container being open on one side and having a plurality of spaced, parallel cardboard partitions dividing the container into a plurality of compartments in which to locate the files. Further according to the invention the container includes one compartment for each file, and the containers are for hard covered files. Still further accordiny to the invention the cardboard is substantially rigid and is of the type known as corrugated cardboard. The invention also provides a container of the type described in knock down or kit form, said kit form including at least one container member for constructing the box a plurality of partition members and formations associated with the container and partition members for locating the partitions. An embodiment of the invention described by way of example only follows with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a front view of a container for files Fig. 2 is a view of part of the interior of the container during assembly thereof and Fig. 3 is a view of a partition. In this embodiment of the invention a container 1 for hard covered lever arch files is made from heavy corrugated cardboard and is substantially rectangular in shape with one side 2 being open. The container 1 is provided with five parallel spaced partitions 3 which divide its length into six equal compartments 4 in which the lever arch files may be located. As may be seen from Fig. 3 of the drawing the partitions 3 are planar corrugated cardboard members of rectangular shape and having pairs of outwardly directed flanges 5 running along the upper and lower edges 6 and 7 thereof. These flanges are easily provided by splitting the two outer layers of the cardboard and folding these layers in opposite directions The partitions 3 are kept in place by a plurality of tongue members 8 which are integral with the front edges 9 of the container. These tongues 8 are separated from each other by the width of the cardboard of the partitions 3 and fold back onto the top and bottom panels 10 of the container thereby sandwiching the flanges 5 between themselves and the container walls. It will be appreciated that in this way the partitions are firmy secured in place. The size of the tongues are such that they are retained in position by way of an interference fit. The container provides for storage for files and several containers may be stacked one on top of the other without any damage to themselves. Furthermore they are easily assemblied and it is envisaged that the containers will be sold in a knock down or kit form. Such a kit would comprise an unassembled container member with integral side, top, bottom and back members which can be folded into position as well as integral tongue members.Additionally the kit would include panel members with fold lines at the top and bottom for formations of the flanges. The invention thus provides a container for files which is easy to construct, lightweight and strong. Furthermore because of the material of manufacture it is envisaged that the container will be relatively inexpensive. Other embodiments are envisaged within the scope of the invention and include other configurations of the invention.
