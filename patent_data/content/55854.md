# Dual stage engagement for viscous fluid coupling.

## Abstract
A viscous fan clutch 10 is typically employed in a fan drive mechanism within a truck or automobile. A shaft 12 driven by the engine, rotates a clutch member 24 within the fan drive. The clutch member is arranged for fluid engage ment with a cover assembly 38 for the transmission of torque thereto when the fluid is disposed in an operating chamber 70 defined by complementary shear surfaces 30, 31, 56, and 57 in the clutch and cover. During relative rotation between the clutch and cover, fluid is pumped from the operating chamber to primary 76 and secondary 77 fluid storage chambers. Independent fluid temperature re sponsive control valves 120 and 190 provide for selective communication between the storage chambers and the operating chamber to effect modulation of the total fluid flow whereby dual speed operation of the clutch is achieved. In the preferred embodiment, one of the valves operates in response to impinging ambient air at a relatively low temperature and the other valve operates in response to sensed engine coolant temperature at a relatively high temperature.
