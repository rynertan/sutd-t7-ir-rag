# Magneto optical recording system.

## Abstract
In a magneto optical file memory a storage medium 17 including a magnetic film 17b is irradiated with a laser beam to reverse the magnetization direction of the magnetic film, thereby to write and or erase information. The laser beam is focused by an optical system 15 on the storage medium 17 , which optical system 15 is controlled by an actuator 16 , wherein the sense of the leakage magnetic field Ha of the actuator 16 is set to agree with the sense of the initial magnetization of the magnetic film 17b of the storage medium 17 . To reproduce the information recorded on the storage medium the rotation of the polarization plane of light reflected from the storage medium is detected.
