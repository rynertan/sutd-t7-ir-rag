# Process of preparing coated carrier particles for electrostatographic developers.

## Abstract
A process of preparing coated carrier particles for elec trostatographic developer coated carrier particles for use in the development of electrostatic latent images are provided by mixing carrier core materials with powdered thermoplastic re sin particles having a size of between 0.1 micron and 30 mic rons, and comprising between 0.05 and 3 percent by weight of the coated carrier particles. The carrier core materials are mixed with the resin particles until the resin particles mechani cally and or electrostatically adhere to the core materials and the mixture is heated to a temperature of between 160 C and 345 C for between 120 minutes and 20 minutes so that the re sin particles melt and fuse to the carrier core materials. The coated carrier particles are cooled, classified to the desired particle size, and mixed with finely divided toner particles to form a developer mixture. The process is especially advan tageous for coating carrier particles with resin materials having poor solubility characteristics.
