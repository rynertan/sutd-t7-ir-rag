# Fire safe seal for swivel joint.

## Abstract
A fire safe seal for use in a swivel joint in a pressurized fluid subject to fire risk, the seal having both a metal anti extrusion ring 23, 23a, 23b, 23c, 23d, 23e and an annular resilient non metallic seal member 22, 22a, 22b, 22c, 48 to provide essentially zero fluid linkage at normal operating temperatures, and the anti extrusion ring to provide an extremely low rate of leakage in the event high temperature should destroy the resilient seal member. A curved spring 34 or other metal anti cocking device 41, 41a, 41b, 47 biases the anti extrusion ring tightly against the junction of a male 10 and a female 11 joint to ensure that the ring remains in position after the resilient seal member is destroyed to prevent leakage through the junction.
