# ROTARY REGENERATIVE HEAT EXCHANGER FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE APPLICATIONS

## Abstract
A rotary regenerative heat exchanger 10 is particularly adapted for use in exchanging heat from a hot gas entering the heat exchanger at a temperature in the range of 2000 3000F to low temperature air to be heated. An upper rotor 20 and a lower rotor 30 are supported concentrically about a rotor post 12 mounted for rotation successively through the hot gas and air flows at a vertical axis. The hot gas enters and the heated air exists through the top of the heat exchanger, while the cooled gas exists and the cold air to be heated enters through the bottom of the heat exchanger. The upper rotor 20 houses ceramic heat absorbent blocks 40 adapted to withstand the high temperatures existing in the upper portion of the heat exchanger, while the low rotor 30 houses typical metallic element suitable for use at more moderate temperatures.
