## Description
This invention relates to a moldable selfsupporting material, particularly for manufacturing self supporting liners for the interiors of automobile vehicles, such as self supporting roof panels, door panels, rear window decks, and the like, and for the manufacture of self supporting panels for false ceilings in the construction industry, as well as to a method of manufacturing it. As is known, self supporting liners of the above type are currently formed from a moldable support or backing layer whereon an either textile or synthetic in view layer is deposited with the optional interposition of a padding in the form of a foam layer.With a view to reducing both the weight and cost of currently employed self supporting liners, the use of liners has been proposed which comprise a cardboard support or backing member, whereon is laid, with the interposition of an adhesive, the either textile or synthetic in view layer, if desired with the additional interposition of said padding. The above prior art liner, while providing a solution to the weight reduction problem, is not devoid of many serious drawbacks, and it is, mainly, difficult to mold into deep shapes, while the adhesive is affected by moisture and heat to result in the delamination of the in view layer from the support or backing layer. The former drawback is particularly disadvantageous because it substantially restricts the utilization of said known material to the construction of flat or shallow elements. Thus, the task of the present invention is that of eliminating such drawbacks. Within this task it is an important object of the invention to provide a lightweight thermally and acoustically insulating material for self supporting liners which is sufficiently elastic to facilitate the installation of elements of a large size, and above all, suitable for hot molding into sectional members which may be deeply dimpled. Yet another object of this invention is the provision of a material as indicated, which has higher thermal and acoustical insulation prpperties, is light in weight, unaffected by moisture, inexpensive, and of pleasing outside appearance. According to one aspect of the present invention, these and other objects such as will be apparent from the following detailed description, are achieved by a moldable self supporting material, particularly for manufacturing self supporting liners for the compartments of automobile vehicles and self supporting panels for false ceilings in the building industry, character ized in that it comprises a corrugated cardboard supporting member covered, on at least one side thereof, with a layer of hot moldable felt formed from natural and or artificial and or synthetic textile fibers and thermoplastic and heat setting resins. In particular, the cardboard forming the supporting member is preferably of the type which includes fibers of a thermoplastic polymeric material, thereby the bond between the supporting member and the felt layer s is accomplished by melting under hot pressing. The plasticity feature of the felt layer further allows preforming by direct molding to any depth of profile section to ensure a uniform distribution of tYe material and complete absence of wrinkles and or tears from the resulting material. The cardboard may comprise a single corrugated sheet, or a corrugated sheet coupled to one or two flat sheets to form a cardboard of the type having parallel closed cells, the use of cell cardboard being advantageous from the standpoint of structural rigidity, in view of the higher moment of inertia of the structure, and from the standpoint of insulation in view of the presence of air circulation channels. The card 4 board may also be, for specially severe applications, of the type having plural corrugations, including cruciform corrugations. Further features and advantages will become clearly apparent from the detailed description which follows, to be taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, given herein by way of example and not of limitation, and where Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view showing the structural arrangement of the material in the version thereof having two felt coated sides Figure 2 is a schematic sectional view of a press, illustrating the molding procedure for a lining material made of the inventive material Figure 3 is a perspective view, partly sectioned, of a preformed element according to the invention, as removed from the molding press and Figures 4,5,6,7 and 8 are sectional views of res pective modificationsvof the backing or supporting cardboard. With initial reference to Figures 1 to 3, the chartoter S generally designates a continuous supporting or backing member comprising corrugated cardboard of the type with closed parallel cells resulting from the superimposition of a corrugated sheet f1 onto a flat sheet f2 the cardboard of the supporting memberS being preferably of the type including fibers of a thermoplastic polymeric material intermingled with cellulose fibers and optional inert fillers. According to the invention, on at least one side or face of said supporting member, but advantageously on both sides thereof, as shown in Figure 1, there is applied a covering layer SC1 SC2, respectively comprising a felt formed from natural and or artificial and or synthetic fibers and heat setting anE,thermoplastic resins said felt, which is known per se, it being formed from textile material waste, industrial cotton, optional inert fillers, and optional resin binders.The supporting and covering layers are successively subjected to a hot pressing force P which results in the curing of the heat setting resins and softening of the thermoplastic fibers and resins, thus intimately welding said support and layers together to yield the finished product. The operation is advantageously carried out on a press PR of the type shown in Figure 2 and having heated half molds 10 11, heat being supplied thereto by circulating a fluid through conditioning ducts 12 13 or by some other means, at a temperature in the 140 to 2000C range and under a molding pressure in the 1 to 4 2 kg em2 range. The moldability features of the covering layers Sc SO2 enable preforming by molding even to deep dimpled profiles without undergoing wrinkling or tearing of the resulting material. After the releaelng from the mold and optional cooling under pressure, the finished product,in the form of a self supporting coating RA,pres ents itself as shown in Figure 3 with the required characteristics of rigidity, preformed and provided with exposed surfaces which are perfectly uniform. The coating cross section shows a uniform distribution of the covering layer material which fills the spaces v included between adjacent corrugations of the support, thus forming a homogeneous structure. While the atilization of a double sheet cardboard as shown in Figure 1 is advantageous for the formation of the support S, the same depending on the final user s requirements may be formed from a cardboard having a single corrugated sheet f as shown inFigure 4, or from a cardboard of the type comprising a corrugated sheet f sandwiched between two flat sheets f4 f6, respectively, as in the embodiment ofFigure 5, or from different combinations as shown inFigures 6,7 and 8. The utilization of the latter cardboard types is advantageous where a higher rigidity is sought for the finished exposed coating,in view of the higher moment of inertia of the resisting section of said cardboards. 7 It should be noted that the finished lirer, after removal from the mold, has such features as to permit the direct utilization of screws and rivets, in particular of screws of the self tapping type, thus facilitating the attachment of any accessories normally provided inside the interior compartment of an automobile vehicle. Of course, within thetprinciple of the inventions the constructional details and embodiments thereof may be largely modified from the ones described and shown herein by way of example only, without departing from the invention scope.
