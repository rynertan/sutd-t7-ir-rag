# Combinatorial weighing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a combinatorial weighing method and apparatus in which weight data from N number of weighing machines containing articles are combined to obtain an optimum combination of weighing machines giving a total combined weight value of articles equal to a preset value Wa or closet to the preset value Wa within preset allowable limits, and in which the articles are discharged from the obtained optimum combination of weighing machines. The method includes starting combinations with i as the initial number of weighing machines, wherein the i number of weighing machines in weighing machine combinations serves as a weighing machine number which tends to afford the optimum combination more readily than other numbers of the weighing machines, i being an integer less than N. Further steps include generating continuously only combina tions which select the i number of weighing machines from the N number of weighing machines, determining whether the total weight value of each combination composed of the i number of weighing machines falls within the preset allowable limits, storing a combination which is within the preset allowable limits, and discharging articles based on the stored combination when the combination is the optimum combination among all combinations composed of the i number of weighing machines. The initial value of i is set to N 2 when N is even, to N 2 0.5 when N is odd, or to a value obtained by performing the following operation
