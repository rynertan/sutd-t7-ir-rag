# Bis tetrazolemethyl substituted beta lactam antibiotics, their preparation and pharmaceutical formulations containing them.

## Abstract
Broad spectrum β lactam antibiotics are described. They are represented by the formula The compounds are obtained by reacting a 7 acylamino 3 halomethyl 1 oxa β lactam ester with the desired 1 or 2 tetrazolemethyl substituted 1H or 2H tetrazole 5 thiol, or alternatively by reacting a 7 amino 3 halomethyl 1 oxa β lactam ester with the bis tetrazole thiol and then N acylating with the desired carboxylic acid.
