# Process for treating cyanic liquid containing copper I cyanide complex ion.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved process for treating a cyanic liquid containing copper I cyanide com plex ion which comprises heating the liquid at a temperature of not lower than 200 C in the presence of a water soluble metal hydroxide, whereby the decomposition of the CN group of copper I cyanide complex ion is accomplished in a high rate in a single batch producing a relatively small amount of sludge even when the liquid has a high CN concentration.
