## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARTNG ARYLACETALDEHYDES The present invention relates to a process for preparing arylacetaldehydes from arylmethyl halides by their reaction with carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Arylacetaldehydes are useful as perfumes and also as intermediates in the production of agricultural chemicals and pharmaceuticals. For the production of arylacetaldehydes by the reaction of arylmethyl halides with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, a process is disclosed in Hung.P.150,412 Chemical Abstracts,60,2847e, 1964 . This process, however,requires a large auantity of catalyst,and still the yield of the desired compound is poor. Also,Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 144,503 1978 discloses the production of phenylacetaldehyde by reacting benzyl chloride with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of octacarbonyl dicobalt and an N,N disubstituted acid amide. However, the yield of the product in this process is at the most about 5090 even when a large amount of the catalyst is used. We have now found that the reaction of aryl methyl halides with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst together with an inorganic base as appropriately selected provides arylacetaldehydes in high yields with the use of only a small amount of the catalyst. According to this invention, there is provided a process for preparing an arylacetaldehyde by reaction of the corresponding arylmethyl halide with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a cobalt compound and a basic reagent in a liquid medium, characterized in that the basic reagent is an inorganic alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound and the liquid medium is a solvent system which is a nitrile, or a mixture thereof with a hydrocarbon. The arylmethyl halide as the starting material may be any aromatic compound having at least one halomethyl group on the aromatic ring. The aromatic ring may be monocyclic or polycyclic and also condensed or non condensed.On the aromatic ring, there may be present, in addition to the halomethyl group s , any other substituent s which may be influenced during the reaction but do not interfere with the reaction on the said halomethyl group s . Examples of such substituent s are C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkoxy, halogen e.g. chlorine, bromine, fluorine, iodine , etc. Preferred arylmethyl halides may be represented by the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 and R2, which may be same or different, are each hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkoxy or halogen particularly chlorine and X is halogen particularly chlorine . Specific examples of the arylmethyl halide I are benzyl chloride, p fluorobenzyl chloride, p chlorobenzyl chloride, p methylbenzyl chloride, p ethylbenzylchloride p isopropylbenzyl chloride, p tert butylbenyl chloride, p methoxybenzyl chloride, p ethoxybenzyl chloride, and o,p di methylbenzyl chloride. The cobalt compound used as the catalyst may be any that is conventionally employed for carbonylation and hydroformylation, which includes complexes having carbon monoxide, phosphines or amines as ligands, carboxylates, hydroxides, halides, oxides and nitrates. Specific examples are cobalt carbonyls, cobalt hydroxide, cobalt carbonate, cobalt acetate, cobalt formate, cobalt naphthenate and cobalt bromide. Particularly preferred are cobalt carbonyls, which include octacarbonyl dicoba .t, dodecacarbonyl tetracobalt, hydridotetracarbonyl cobalt and hexacarbonyl bis tri n butylphosphine dicobalt. In the reaction system in which the basic reagent coexists, these cobalt carbonyls may substantially be converted to cobalt carbonyl anions, for example, the alkali metal salt of tetracarbonyl cobalt which may be catalytically active.A preferred range of the amount of the catalyst is from 10 4 to 10 1 gram atom calculated as metallic cobalt based on one mole of the arylmethyl halide. The inorganic alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compound usable as the basic reagent may be an inorganic compound of an alkali metal which is alkaline at room temperature e.g.about 5 to 300C in aqueous solution.Specific examples are oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, phosphates, silicates and borates. Preferred are the carbonates of alkali metals, and particularly preferred are sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. The amount of the inorganic alkali metal compound may be equivalent to or slightly in excess of one mole of the arylmethyl halide. The solvent system, which is preferably used in the process of the invention is a nitrile or a mixture thereof with hydrocarbon. Examples of nitriles are acetonitrile,benzonitrile,etc. Examples of hydrocarbons are those having not more than 12 carbon atoms such as cyclohexane. The concentration of the arylmethyl halide in these solvent systems is usually from 1 to 80t by weight, preferably from 5 to 50 by weight. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen may be introduced into the reaction system separately but they are usually introduced as a mixture. The molar ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen in the mixture is normally 1 or more, preferably from 1 to 5, so that the desired compound will be produced in a high selectivity. The mixture is normally used at a pressure of not less than 10 atm, preferably from 50 to 300 atm.The mixture need not be pure for example, it may contain an inert gas such as nitrogen or helium. The reaction temperature is not particularly limited, but a temperature in the range of from 50 to 200 C, preferably of from 80 to 160 C, may be employed. The reaction time depends upon the other reaction conditions such as the retention temperature, but a period of from 0.5 to 10 hours is generally adopted. The reaction may be carried out batchwise or continuously. In order to prevent the reaction system from contamination with metal compounds which may dissolve out of a reactor wall the use of a reactor of which the inside wall is protected by a glass lining or an anticorrosive material, such as Hastelloy, is desired. The thus produced arylacetaldehyde may be separated from the reaction mixture and purified by per se conventional techniques such as distillation and extraction. The arylacetaldehyde produced corresponds substantially to the starting arylmethyl halide. The arylacetaldehyde is an aromatic compound having at least one formylmethyl group on the aromatic ring. The aromatic ring may be monocyclic or polycyclic and also condensed or non condensed. There may also be present on the aromatic ring, in addition to the formylmethyl group s , any other substituent s which are same as or different from those present in the starting arylmethyl halide. Examples of such substituent s are C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkoxy, halogen e.g. chlorine, bromine, fluorine, iodine , etc. Preferred arylacetaldehydes may be represented by the formula EMI6.1 wherein R and R , which may be same or different, are each 1 2 hydrogen, C1 C6 alkyl, C1 C6 alkoxy or halogen particularly chlorine . Specific examples of the arylacetaldehyde II are phenylacetaldehyde, p fluorophenylacetaldehyde, p chlorophenylacetaldehyde, p methylphenylacetaldehyde, p ethylphenylacetaldehyde, p isopropylphenylacetaldehyde, p tertbutylphenylacetaldehyde, p methoxyphenylacetaldehyde, pethoxyphenylacetaldehyde, o,p dimethylphenylacetaldehyde, etc. The process of this invention will be illustrated specifically with reference to the following examples, which are not however to be interpreted as limiting the invention thereto.
