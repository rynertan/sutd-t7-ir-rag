# Display terminal with a cursor responsive virtual distributed menu.

## Abstract
An interactive display terminal of the multiple overlap ping window type is provided. Each of the windows 42 is smaller in dimension than the overall display screen. One or more of the windows have an associated virtual distri buted menu which is made up of a plurality of menu items 43 50 respectively distributed about the periphery 41 of the associated window but not displayed during normal operations. Cursor means and means for moving the cursor are also provided. The display terminal further includes apparatus which in response to the movement of the cursor across a selected region in a window periphery will effect the display of a selected menu item associated with the particular selected region. The overlapping windows are preferably rectangular in shape and the selected regions are adjacent to corners of the periphery. The menu items are distributed so as to be positioned adjacent to the re spective region across which the cursor movement will result in the item display.
