# Vinyl chloride propylene copolymers having increased porosity.

## Abstract
Vinyl chloride propylene copolymer resin having impro ved porosity as shown by an increased irreversible plastici zer take up is produced by the suspension polymerization of vinyl chloride and propylene in the presence of a binary suspension system of a hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose having 19 30 methoxyl and 4 12 hydroxypropoxyl substi tution and a 30 50 mole hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol.
