## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to an anti rat liver monoclonal antibody which detects an antigen particularly associated with adult rat hepatocytes and not with other normal syngenetic rat cell types.The antigen is absent or its expression is considerably reduced in chemically induced rat hepatomas. The rat liver has become a model system for examining the early stages in chemical carcinogenesis.Hepatomas may be reproducibly induced by feeding dietary liver carcinogens such as 4 dimethylaminoazobenzene and, in addition, the existence of putative preneoplastic or premalignant lesions hyperplastic nodules and enzyme altered foci in carcinogen altered livers renders the system amenable to studies on the early stages of carcinogenesis before the appearance of frank tumours. The purpose of this study was, firstly, to define a liver associated antigen normally expressed on adult rat hepatocytes and secondly, to examine changes in the expression of this antigen on chemically induced rat liver tumours and on early carcinogen induced lesions. Monoclonal antibodies possess important advantages over conventional antisera in the detection and investigation of cell surface antigens and, in order to detect a liver associated antigen we have zs used the hybridoma technique devised by Nil stein and colleagues Kohler and Milstein, 1977 to produce an antibody which is directed against adult rat hepatocytes. In the context of liver carcinogenesis there have, to our knowledge, been no attempts to examine those changes in the expression of normal liver cell surface antigens which may be of crucial importance for the development of the premalignant or malignant phenotype. According to the present invention, therefore, there is provided the anti rat liver antibody monoclone RL23 clone 36. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided an anti rat liver monoclonal antibody adapted to detect an antigen associated with mammalian hepatocytes but not with normal syngenetic cell types.The mammals preferably selected from homo sapiens and ratus spp. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of detecting the presence or absence of a mammalian hepatocyte antigen which comprises screening said hepatocyte against an anti rat liver monoclonal antibody and assessing the degree of reactivity thereof. The screening may be effected by means of immunoperoxidase staining techniques. In a still further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for the preparation of an anti rat liver monoclonal antibody adapted to detect an antigen associated with mammalian hepatocytes, which method comprises Separating rat hepatocytes from rat liver and forming a single cell suspension thereof, injecting said suspension into a receptor mouse, extracting Spleen cells from said mouse after a suitable interval and fusing the same with mouse myeloma cells to provide a hybrid cell culture hybridoma , and subsequently testing said hybridoma for the production of antibodies binding to dispersed mammalian hepatocytes. In a preferred feature those hybridomas with apparent binding facility are preferably clonepurified and subsequently re tested for reactivity against target and non target cells. The invention will now be described, by way of illustration only with reference to the following example, and to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 shows the binding ratio Specificity of the anti rat liver monoclonal antibody, both to hepatocytes and to other target cells, Figure 2 shows the binding of mouse immunoglobulins and monoclonal antibodies to dispersed rat hepatocytes, Figure 3 shows the reactivity of the anti rat liver monoclonal antibody against hepatocytes from various rat strains, and Figure 4 shows the reactivity of the monoclonal antibody against transplanted primary rat hepatomas, and Figure 5 a to 5 h show staining patterns with immunoperoxidase techniques.Preparation of cells Hepatocytes were prepared from 6 weeks old male rats by a modification of the recirculating enzyme perfusion method of Berry and Friend 1969 , using calcium free Krebs Hanseleit bicarbonate buffer as the basic perfusion medium. Briefly, rats were perfused through the portal vein first with 40 ml of buffer containing 1 0 mM EDTA, then with 160 ml of unsupplemented buffer at a flow rate of 25 ml min 1. The first 100 ml of perfusate were discarded through a cannula inserted into the abdominal inferior vena cava. The remaining 100 ml were cyclically perfused and collagenase was added to a final concentration of 0.05 w v . Perfusion was continued for about 15 min at which point the liver was removed and the liver capsule disrupted.Cells were gently combed out of the liver vasculature and suspended in Hams F10 medium containing 1 w v bovine serum albumin. All perfusion media were maintained at 370 C, pH 7.4, and equilibrated with 02 C02 95 5 throughout the procedure. The cells were filtered and the resulting suspension was washed twice by low speed centrifugation. Viability was assessed by a trypan blue exclusion test and preparations of less than 90 viability were discarded. Spleen, lymph node, thymus, bone marrow and testis cells were prepared by mechanical disaggregation and peritoneal exudate cells by peritoneal lavage. Peripheral blood lymphocytes and red blood cells were separated according to Boyum 1968 . Exocrine pancreas cells were prepared by the method of Amsterdam et al 1978 and mammary epithelial cells according to Foster and Feldman 1975 . Brain cells were prepared by exposure to a mixture of collagenase and hyaluronidase while renal cortical, lung, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle cells were obtained both by exposure to trypsin and to colla genase hyaluronidase. Keratinocytes were prepared by the method of Yuspa et al 1980 .Animals and Tumours Inbred WAB Not and Kx Not rats were maintained by single line brother sister mating. SpragueDawley and PVG c rats and Baltic mice were obtained from commercial suppliers. Hepatomas were induced by oral administration of 4 dimethylaminoazobenzene and were either used directly as primary tumours D225 and D226 or were maintained by serial subcutaneous passage in WAB Not D23, D30, D192A orKx Not KxD2 rats. Tumour cell lines used as targets in antibody assays were grown in vitro as recently derived monolayer cultures in Eagles MEMSupplemented with 10 calf serum. An ascitic variant of hepatoma D23 was passaged intraperitoneally every 10 days in WAB Not rats. Immunization and Cell Fusion Single cell suspensions of hepatocytes were washed twice in Hams F10 medium without supplements and Balb c mice were injected intranperitoneally three times at weekly intervals with 2 x 107 cells. Spleen cells from these mice were prepared by gentle teasing of the spleen in a small amount of RPMI 1640 medium and fused with the mouse myeloma P3 NS1 Ag4 using 50 polyethylene glycol British Drug Houses,M. Wt. 1500 by the method of Galfre et al 1977 . The mouse myeloma cell line was provided byDr. C. Milstein, Department of Molecular Biology,Cambridge. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1096 foetal calf serum and 15 rg ml 8 Azaguanine Sigma, London as suspension cultures. Isotopic Antiglobulin Assay An assay employing 125l labelled rabbit F ab 2 anti mouse lgG was used, as described by Al Sheikly et al 1980 . Target cells were aliquoted at 105 hepatocytes , 5 x 106 red blood cells or 2 x 105 all other cells per well in Microtiter plates containing 96 round bottomed wells.The cells except hepatocytes were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in 10051 hybridoma supernatant or, in controls, 100 I P3 MS1 myeloma supernatant, purified mouse lgG, purified mouse lgGl or a commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody, Ox 1 Sera lab . After Ih incubation on ice the cells were again centrifuged, the supernatant removed, and the cells washed 4 times in Hanks balanced salt solution containing 0.1 bovine serum albumin HBSS BSA . The cells were resuspended in 50 1 125 l 1abelled rabbit F ab 2 anti mouse lgG at 5 ng protein per well about 105 counts per well . After Ih incubation on ice the antiglobulin was removed and the cells washed 6 times.The plate was dried, sealed with a plastic spray and the wells were separated and counted individually in a gamma counter. Results were expressed as cpm or as binding ratios as appropriate. Samples were tested in at least quadruplicate and the results analysed by theStudent t test.Indirect ImmunoDeroxidase Techniaue Blocks of tissue were placed in OCT embedding compound Lab Tek Products, Naperville, IL , frozen in liquid N2 cooled iso pentane 2 methylbutane on small cork boards and stored at 1300 C. Sections were cut in a cryostat at 6 Am, thawed, air dried for 70 min at room temperature on glycerin albumintreated slides, and fixed in acetone for 10 min.Sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with the following reagents, a undiluted antibody, b rabbit anti mouse lg DAKO immunoglobulins a s diluted to 1 1000 with TRIS saline pH 7.6 , c swine anti rabbit lg DAKO diluted to 1 40 with TRIS saline, d rabbit peroxidase anti peroxidase PAP complex DAKO diluted to 1 89 with TRIS saline. Following each incubation the reagent was flushed off the slide with TRIS saline and slides were washed in TRIS saline for 3 min with gentle agitation. Rabbit anti mouse and swine anti rabbit lgs were each incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10 normal rat serum in TRIS saline to block non specific binding of immunoglobulins to the tissue sections.Following incubation with rabbit PAP complex slides were washed for 3 min at 370 C in TRIS saline. The peroxidase substrate, diaminobenzidine DAB , 5 mg in 10 ml TRIS saline in 0.01 hydrogen peroxide was added and the peroxidase reaction allowed to continue for 5 min at 370 C. The DAB was then washed off in running tap water for 5 min and the slides were counter stained in haematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared in xylene and mounted in DPX mountant BDH Chemicals Ltd., Development and Specificity of the Anti Rat LiverMonoclonal Antibody Fusion of the mouse myeloma P3 NS1 and hepatocyte immune WAP Not rat spleen cells produced 48 hybrid cultures. Supernatants from these hybridomas were assessed for the production of antibodies binding to dispersed rat hepatocytes in the radioisotopic antiglobulin assay.Of the 10 positive supernatants detected, 7 showed only weak reactivity against hepatocytes and subsequently lost activity. The 3 remaining hybridomas showed strong reactivity against hepatocytes. One of these also showed reactivity against syngenetflc adult rat spleen and lymph node cells and was not tested further.The two remaining anti liver hybridomas were clonepurified twice on rat peritoneal exudate cell feeder layers by limiting dilution and, in a series of preliminary specificity tests, clones were examined for preferential reactivity with hepatocytes compared to reactivity with freshly prepared normal syngenetic adult male rat cell types. Supernatants of clones derived from one hybridoma hybridoma RL24 showed reactivity against hepatocytes and also consistently displayed reactivity against several other rat cell types, notably brain, renal cortex and cardiac muscle, while the two clones showing reactivity against hepatocytes derived from the remaining hybridoma hybridoma RL23 showed preferential reactivity with hepatocytes.One of these clones subsequently lost activity while the remaining clone RL23 clone 36 Cancer ResearchCampaign Laboratories University of Nottingham, Deposit dated 13th October, 1981 appeared to be stable and was extensively tested for reactivity against a further range of normal, syngenetic adult rat cell types. The results of a series of these tests are shown in Fig. 1. Normal cell types were prepared as fresh, single cell suspensions from male WAB Not rats by several methods involving exposure to colleagenase mammary epithelium , a mixture of collagenase and hyaluronidase brain , trypsin lung, renal cortex, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and keratinocytes , or without enzyme treatment spleen, lymph node, peritoneal exudate, thymus, bone marrow, peripheral blood lymphocytes, red blood cells, testis and pancreas . Compared with binding of supernatant from P3 NS1 stock cultures, the supernatant from clone RL23 36 consistently produced increased binding of 125 l labelled rabbit F ab 2 anti mouse lgG against hepatocytes. Other syngenetle rat cell types, however, were completely negative with the exception of renal cortical cells which showed only a low degree of reactivity. Cells originally prepared by trypsinization and subsequently tested after preparation with collagenase showed essentially the same reactivity with the RL23 36 clone supernatant indicating that lack of reactivity with negative cell types was not due to degradation of a trypsin sensitive antigen. Reactivitv of a Ranze of Mouse Immunoglobulins withDisDersed Rat Henatocstes Dispersed rat hepatocytes show a high capacity for uptake of monomeric and polymeric lgA by simple absorptive endocytosis Tolleshaug et al, 1981 .This uptake is not species specific and other immunoglobulins such as aggregated lgG and, to a lesser extent, native lugs, will also bind to hepatic parenchymal cells Hopf et al, 1976 . It was importent, therefore, to ensure that binding of the antirat liver monoclonal antibody to dispersed rat hepatocytes could not result from such a phenonemon. RL23 36 gave a clear precipitation line with rabbit anti mouse lgG1 and not with other lgG subclasses in Ouchterlony gels indicating that mouse lI was an appropriate control for PL23 36 monoclonal antibody in antibody binding assays. Purified mouse 1tG1 and lgG, adusted to an appropriate antibody concentration 10p g per ml showed only slight reactivity with dispersed rat hepatocytes in the radioisotopic antiglobulin assay compared with RL23 36 Fig. 2 .Similar effects were observed with several mouse anti rat lymphocyte monoclonal antibodies, Oxl, 0x4, 0x6, Ox7, 0x8 and W3 25, and with two mouse anti human tumour monoclonal anti bodies, a791T 36 c13 andHCT8 1HcI1O details for Oxl only are shown in Fig. 2 .Reactivity of the Monoclonal Antibody with Henato cvtes from Several Rat Strains Hepatocytes were prepared from several rat strains and tested for reactivity with the anti liver monoclonal antibody. RL23 36 consistently showed strong reactivity with WAB Not rat hepatocytes compared with medium from P3 Ns1 stock cultures Fig. 3 .Hepatocytes from Kx Not, Sprague Dawley and PVG c rats shwoed similar reactivity with the anti liver monoclonal antibody. The antigen detected by RL23 36 is therefore not rat strain specific.Reactivity of the Monoclonal Antibody with Hepatomas Cells derived from a number of 4 dimethylaminoazobenzene DAB induced hepatomas were tested for reactivity with RL23 36 supernatant. Hepatoma cells derived either directly by trypsinization of tumour lines maintained by serial subcutaneous transplantation, from an ascitic variant carried intraperitoneally, or from cells growing in tissue culture, were negative when compared to hepatocytes in the same test Fig. 4 . Similarly, two primary DAB induced hepatomas, D225 and D226, showed considerably reduced expression of the antigen detected byRL23 35 supernatant. Immunoneroxidase Staining of Liver and Tumour The cellular distribution and localisation of the antigen detected by the anti rat liver monoclonal antibody was further examined by the unlabelled antibody PAP staining method. Fig. 5a shows the pattern of staining consistently obtained with monoclonal antibody RL23 36. Cells within the liver parenchyma stain strongly and staining appears to be distributed throughout positively stained cells.Cells of the portal tract are not stained. At higher magnification Fig. 5b non hepatocytic parenchymal cells probably Kupffer cells are seen to be negatively stained. RL23 36, therefore, specifically stains hepatocytes within the rat liver. A control mouse monoclonal antibody c791T 36 c13 clearly showed negative reactivity with normal rat liver Fig. sic . Sections of transplanted DAB induced hepatomas for example, hepatoma D23, Fig. 5d showed no staining with the monoclonal antibody confirming data derived from the radiolsotopic antiglobulin assay.However, sections through a small 2 mm DAB induced primary liver lesion revealed an interesting pattern of staining. At low power magnification Fig. 5e tissue normal with respect of the expression of the antibody defined antigen can be seen surrounding the lesion, but both positively and negatively stained areas can be discerned within the lesion. A higher magnification of these areas Fig. 5f reveals cells showing normal distribution of staining, cells showing reduced staining, and cells shoring no staining. The control antibody shows no reactivity with a section through the same lesion Fig. 5g . The antigen detected by the anti liver monoclonal antibody shows an interesting species distribution. A biopsy specimen of human liver stained with the antibody is shown in Fig. 5h and indicates that human hepatocytes are also stained by this monoclonal antibody.
