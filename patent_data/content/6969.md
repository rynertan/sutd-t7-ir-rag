# A polyphosphazene composition stabilized against thermal aging and use therof.

## Abstract
When polyphosphazenes are exposed to elevated temp eratures, their physical properties often deteriorate. The addi tion of a stabilizing compound represented by the structure Especially useful compounds represented by the above structural formula are zinc or magnesium 1,2 bis 2 oxybenzylideneamino ethylene.
