## Abstract
A television camera comprises a control circuit for controlling the electron beam current intensity in at least one pick up tube. To prevent oscillations in a positive feedback control loop a picture signal amplifier in the control loop is provided with a multi step signal limiter. To this end, for a two step signal limitation, a diode and a Zener diode have been provided the junction of which is connected to the base of a biased signal amplifier transistor via a resistor, a second resistor being arranged between the other terminals of the diode and the Zener diode. The junction of the said first diode and the second resistor is connected via at least a second diode to the collector of the signal amplifier transis tor and the base of an emitter follower transistor connected thereto. The junction of the said first Zener diode and the second resistor is connected via a second Zener diode to a voltage terminal.
