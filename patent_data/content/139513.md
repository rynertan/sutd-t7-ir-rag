## Description
FLEXIBLE COATING COMPOSITIONS Technical Field This invention relates to flexible coating compositions which have excellent adherence to metal or plastic and possess superior weathering properties. This composition can be employed as a single coating1 in combination with other coatings. or can be used for each coat of a basecoat clearcoat system. More particularly, the invention relates to coating compositions which comprise hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester made from urethane modified diols reacted with polyol and diacid, crosslinking agent selected from amine aldehyde crosslinking agent and polyisocyanate cross linking agent and, optionally, a high molecular weight linear polyurethane. Background Art Recently. there has been interest in the use of rubbery, resilient materials for areas which are subject to mechanical shock such as automobile bumpers, moldings and front ends. The use of such materials aids in providing protection from permanent structural damage but, in order to attain the desired appearance. a protective coating must have unique properties, such as a high degree of extensibility. impact resistance, resistance to cracking under severe environmental conditions, such as exposure to low temperature and low humidity. Conventional coatings. including those employed on rubber and similar extensible objects heretofore, do not have the required combination of properties. Generally compositions that are flexible enough to be applied over both metal and plastic substrates have rather poor weatherability and overall durability. U.S. Patent 3,882,189 and U.S. Patent 3,962,522 are exemplary of numerous patents which describe flexible coating compositions wherein the resin comprises polyurethane modified polyesters formed by reacting polyisocyanate with polyester polyols. These resins are cured with amine aldehyde crosslinkers. It is taught therein, that the presence of the urethane groups in the polymer significantly contributes to the flexibility as well as improved weathering properties, gloss, and abrasion resistance of the coating. However, while it is thus desirable to employ a substantial number of urethane groups in these resins, the amount which may be included in these types of resins is limited. When hydroxy polyester resin is reacted with polyisocyanate it has a tendency to form a gelled mass and thus the amount of polyisocyanate that may be employed must be restricted in order to avoid gelation.Still further, these urethane linkages are added in a latter modification of the polyester polyol reaction product, rather than being incorporated into the backbone of the resin. Disclosure of the Invention This invention is directed to flexible coating compositions which are suitable for use over various substrates. The compositions may be used over rubbery, resilient materials as well as over metal. The coating compositions of this invention is characterized in that it comprises A hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester i having a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1000 and about 10,000, ii having a hydroxyl number of between about 30 and about 200, and iii containing between about 1 and about 10 urethane groups per molecule1 and being made from reactants comprising 1 urethane modified diol made by reacting a diol. and b diisocyanate, wherein the diol and diisocyanate are reacted in a molar ratio of from about 4 1 to about 4 3 2 polyol comprising at least about 5 weight percent triol and 3 acid component selected from dicarboxylic acids and anhydrides thereof B crosslinking agent selected from amine aldehyde croeslinking agent and polyisocyanate crosslinking agent and C 0 60 weight percent, based on the total weight of A and B , of a linear polyurethane having a number average molecular weight between about 15,000 and about 40.000. preferably of between about 20,000 and about 30,000. This invention is also directed to basecoat clearcoat coating compositions wherein the clearcoat composition comprises the coating composition described above and the basecoat composition comprises the coating composition described above wherein the crosslinking agent is amine aldehyde cross linking agent.The basecoat coating composition additionally comprises pigment. In such systems. the clearcoat composition is in film adherence to the basecoat composition that is in adherence to a substrate. Advantageously, the flexible coatings of the invention of this application possess superior weathering properties as well as excellent adhesion to metal and plastic, thus making them well suited for use as coatings on various car components. In forming the modified polyester of the coatings of the invention of this application, the urethane linkages are advantagesly incorporated into the backbone of the modified polyester.since they are formed in an initial reaction of diisocyanate with diol. rather than being incorporated into the polyester resin in a later reaction step as is done when forming prior art urethane polyester resins.It has now been found that the initial incorporation of the urethane linkage into the backbone of the modified polyester allows the formation of more flexible coatings with improved properties, when compared to the prior art coatings discussed above. Still further. the ability to use of the same coating compositions on metal and plastic components in car production offers distinct commercial advantages, particularly in terms of production efficiency.Additionally, because these coatings can be employed on metal as well as plastic components the problem of color matching, which must be resolved when using a different coating on the metal and plastic. is eliminated. Best Mode for Carryinq Out The Invention This invention is directed to flexible coating compositions which comprise novel hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester crosslinkable with amine aldehyde crosslinking agent or polyisocyanate crosslinking agent. This coating composition may be employed as a pigmented or clearcoating. These coating compositions may also be employed as the basecoat and clearcoat in basecoat clearcoat systems wherein the basecoat comprises amine aldehyde crosslinking agent and pigment. The hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester of the coating composition of this invention has a number average molecular weight Mn of between about 1000 and about 10,000, preferably between about 2000 and about 4000. This modified polyester has a hydroxyl number of between about 30 and about 200, preferably between about 50 and about 120. It also contains between about 1 and about 10 urethane groups per molecule. One of the reactants used to form the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester is a urethane modified diol which is made by reacting diol and diisocyanate. In forming this urethane modified diol, the diol and the diisocyanate are reacted in a molar ratio of from about 4 1 to about 4 3, preferably in a molar ratio of from about 2 0.8 to about 2 1.2, most preferably in a molar ratio of about 2 1.The diols employed in making the urethane modified diol include, but are not limited to, alkylene glycols, such as butylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,5,pentene glycol, 3 cyclohexene l,l dimethynol, and other glycols such as hydrogenated bisphenol A, caprolactone diol i.e., the reaction product of caprolactone and ethylene glycol , hydroxy alkylated bisphenols, polyether glycols, e.g., poly oxytetramethylene glycol, polyester diols, e.g., 2,2 dimethyl 3 hydroxypropyl 2,2 dimethyl 3 hydroxy propionate, and the like. Preferred diols are neopentyl glycol and 2,2 dimethyl 3 hydroxypropyl 2,2 dimethyl 3 hy droxypropionate, the latter material being commercially available as Esterdiol 204 a trademark of and available from Union Carbide Corp., New York, N.Y. . While a number of types of diols have been mentioned above as suitable for use as the diol component in making the urethane modified diol of this invention, their disclosure is not meant to be limiting. A great many diols are known in the art. Selection of other diols which would be suitable for use in forming the urethane modified diol would be well within the skill of those in the art.Mixtures of diols may also be employed in making the urethane modified diol. The diisocyanate employed in making the urethane modified diol may be essentially any diisocyanate. Many such organic diisocyanate are known in the art. Suitable diisocyanates include hydrocarbon diisocyanate or substituted hydrocarbon diisocyanate, such as 1, 6 hexamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, p phenylene diisocyanate, biphenyl diisocyanate, toluene diisocyanate, and 3, 3 dimethyl 4, 4 biphenylene diisocyanate. While the diisocyanate may be any of a number of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, and aromatic diisocyanates, it is preferred that the diisocyanate be an aliphatic diisocyanate, such as 4,4 dicyclohexylmethanediisocyanate. As would be apparent to those skilled in the art, mixtures of various diisocyanates may also be employed as the diisocyanate component used in forming the urethane modifying diol. The polyol component used in forming the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester comprises at least about 5 weight percent triol based on the weight of the polyol component. Preferred triols are conventional low molecular triols such as 1.Z.6 hexene triol, 1,1.1 trimethylol propane. pentaecythritol 3 2 hydroxypropoxy l, 2 propanediol and polycaprolactone triols, which are commercially available as, for example, PCP 301 trademark, Union Carbide Corp., New York, N.Y. . This polyol component may also comprise, in addition to the triol, other polyol material such as diols or tetrol.Preferably however, these other polyols, when employed, consist of diols. Examples of suitable diols which may be included in the polyol component are those which have been disclosed above as suitable for forming the urethane modified diol. Preferred diols for use in the polyol component are linear aliphatic diols. While the polyol component may comprise materials such as diols in addition to the triols, the polyol component may consist essentially of triols. By employing diols in the polyol component in addition to the triols the flexibility of the coating composition is generally increased. Thus selection of the polyol component to be used in forming the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester of the composition will be dependent on the particular desired properties and application of the coating composition.When diols are employed in the polyol component, the polyol preferably compirses from about 10 to about 80 weight percent triols and from about 90 to about 20 weight percent diols. The acid component which is used to form the modified polyester of the composition comprises aliphatic, aromatic, cycloaliphalic dicarboxylic acids or anhydrides thereof. Preferred dicarboxylic acids are the C6 C12 acids, which include adipic, azelaic, sebasic, or dodecane dicarboxylic acid, or cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. More preferably, the dicarboxylic acids employed are aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, most preferably additionally being linear. Mixtures of suitable acids and or their anhydrides may also be used as the acid component in this invention. In forming the coating compositions of this invention the diol a and the diisocyanate b described above are combined and reacted generally at an elevated temperature. so as to form the urethane modified diol. The ratio of the diol and diisocyanate has been chosen i.e., a molar excess of diol so that at the completion of this reaction no free isocyanates are present the isocyanates having been incorporated into a hydroxy functional material. This urethane modified diol is then combined and reacted with the polyol and acid components, generally in the presence of a catalyst and at elevated temperatures, so as to effect formation of a hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester.Suitable catalysts for the carboxy hydroxy condensation reaction include such catalysts as tetraisopropyl titanate. strong acids such as p toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and materials such as zinc oxide. antimony oxide Sb203 and sodium acetate Other catalysts will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The reactions, whereby the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyesters are formed. are generally carried out in the presence of solvents commonly employed in coating formulations such as toluene, xylene, methyl amyl ketone. etc. Another essential component of the coating compositions of this invention is a crosslinking agent.As discussed above, the crosslinking agent employed in the coating compositions of this invention is selected from amine aldehyde crosslinking agent and polyisocyanate crosslinking agent. In basecoat clearcoat systems employing the compositions of this invention as the basecoat composition and the clearcoat composition, the basecoat coating composition crosslinking agent is amine aldehyde crosslinking agent and the clearcoat coating composition crosslinking agent is selected from amine aldehyde crosslinking agent and polyisocyanate crosslinking agent. Amine aldehyde crosslinking agents and polyisocyanate cross linking agents will be discussed in detail. Amine aldehyde cross linking agents suitable for crosslinking hydroxy functional bearing materials are well known in the art. Typically, these crosslinking materials are product of reactions of melamine or urea with formaldehyde and venous alcohols containing up to and includinq 4 carbon atoms. Preferably, the amine aldehyde cross linking agents useful in this invention are amine aldehyde resins such as condensation products of formaldehyde with melamine, substituted melamine, urea, benzoquanamine or substituted benzoquanamine. Preferred members of this class are methylated melamine formaldehyde resins such as hexamethoxymethylmelamine.The particular preferred crosslinkers are the high solids melamine resins which has substantially 100 percent nonvolatile content as measured by the foil method at 450C for 45 minutes. For the purposes of the preferred composition of this invention it should be recognized that it is important not to introduce extraneous diluents that lower the final solids content of the coating. Other suitable amine aldehyde crosslinking agents will be apparent to one skilled in the art. The amine aldehyde materials function as a crosslinking agent in the compositions of the invention by reacting with the hydroxy functionality of the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester A and by reaction with the hydroxy functionality of the linear polyurethane C , if such materials are included in the composition. The amine aldehyde crosslinking agent is generally included ip. the coating composition in an amount of between about 5 and about 60. more preferably between about 20 and about 40 weight percent based on the weight of the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester of the composition. Selection of the optimal amount of amine aldehyde cross linking agent to be employed in the coating composition is dependent on the desired properties of the coating composition e.g..flexibility as well as its intended use. Particularly preferred amine aldehyde cross linking agents are the amino crosslinking agents sold by American Cyanamid Company, Wayne, New Jersey under the trademark µCymel . In particular. Cymel 301, 323, 325. 1130, 1156, which are alkalated melamine aldehyde resins are useful in the compositions of this invention. The crosslinking reactions are catalytically accelerated by acids. One such catalyst for example which may be so employed is p toluene sulfonic acid PTSA which. when employed, is generally added to the composition in about .5s by weight based on the weight of crosslinking agent and hydroxy containing modified polyester of the composition. The other crosslinking agent which may be used in the coating composition of the invention is a polyisocyanate crosslinking agent, i.e., a compound having 2 or more, preferably 3 or more. reactive isocyanate groups per molecule. These polyisocyanate materials function as a cross linking agent in the composition of the invention by reaction with the hydroxyl functionality of the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester A and by reaction with the hydroxyl functionality on the linear polyurethane if such linear polyurethane is included in the composition. This polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is generally included in the coating composition of the invention in an amount of between about 5 and about 60, more preferably between about 20 and about 40 weight percent based on the weight of the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester of the coating composition.Selection of the optimal amount of polyisocyanate cross linking agent to be employed in the coating composition is dependent on the desired properties e.g., flexibility as well as its intended use and selection of such amount would be within the skill of one in the art. Polyisocyanates are well 1 knowri in the art and numerous suitable organic isocyanates having 2 or more reactive isocyandte groups per molecule will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

Especially preferred for use in the compositions of the invention are trimerized products of aliphatic dilsocyanates such as 1.6 hexamethylene diisocyanate.Still another particularly preferred type of polyisocyanate crosslinking agent for the composition is polyisocyanate having a biuret structure. This type of polyisocyanate is well known as are methods for making the seme. One such polyisocyanate crosslinking agent is a high molecular weight biuret of 1.6 hexamethylene diisocyanate sold by Mobay Chemical Company under the tradename Desmodur N. Exemplary of other biuret type polyisocyanates are those prepared in accordance withU.S. Patent 3,976,622 to Wagner et al. When the coating composition of this invention is used as the basecoat and the clearcoat in basecoat clearcoat systems as previously described in this application, the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester employed in the basecoat coating composition and the clearcoat coating composition may be similar or different embodiments of this polyester.Selection of the particular modified polyester to be employed in the coatings would be dependent on the particular properties and application of the coatings desired. Such selection will be well within the skill of one in the art. Similarly the amounts of crosslinking agent to be employed in the basecoat composition and in the clearcoat composition are selected individually, i.e., the weight percent amounts of crosslinker employed in the basecoat composition and in the clearcoat composition of a particular basecoat clearcoat system may be different or be similar. The basecoat coating composition of the invention also includes pigments as noted above. A wide variety of pigments are available and known for use in coating compositions by those skilled in the art.Selection of the optimal amount of pigment to be included in the basecoat composition would be dependent on e.g..desired color. hiding requirements of the coating. etc..and would be within the skill of those in the art. Optional Materials Additional materials which may be employed in the coating compositions of this invention include a high molecular weight linear polyurethane which has a number average molecular weight of between about 15,000 and about 40,000, preferably between about 20,000 and about 30,000.It may be made by reacting one of the above mentioned diisocyanates and diols, such as oligoester diol, polycaprolactone diol, polyoxypropylene diol, polyether diols, etc. Suitable high molecular weight linear polyurethane materials are commercially available, for example, as Spenlite L06 30S, available from and a trademark of Spencer Kellogg, Buffalo, New York .

While this linear polyurethane, when employed it b2secoat clearcoat systems, is generally preferably only included in the basecoat composition, it may be employed in either or both coats and the amounts employed are independently selected. It has been noted above that in basecoat clearcoat systems, the coating compositions of this application may be employed as one or both coatings.In those instances where it is used for both coats of a basecoat clearcoat system, the basecoat composition and the clear coat composition may be substantially alike or may be different embodiments of the claimed coating composition as would be dependent on the particular properties and application desired.

The coating composition may be used as a clear coating on a substrate, e.g., over conventional paints for enhanced gloss or over pigmented plastic substrates as a protective coating. In these instances, the coating composition would preferably include the combination of a benzotriazole such as Tinuvin 328 a trademark of and commercially available from Ciba Geigy, Ardsley, N.Y. , and the hindered polymeric amine of the concurrently filed application noted above, and an antioxidant, such asIrganox 1010 a trademark of and available fromCiba Geigy . In those instances wherein the coating composition are employed, with modification, as desired, as a basecoat and a clearcoat in a basecoat clearcoat system, a preferred embodiment of the basecoat would preferably contain only a U.V. stabilizer such as Tinuvin 328 and the clearcoat would contain a benzotriazole, e.g.,Tinuvin 328, the polymeric hindered amine light stabilizer of the aforemention application to Kordomenas et al and an antioxidant, e.g., Irganox 1000 trademark, Ciba Geigy .While several applications of the coating composition of this invention have been proposed, e.g., as primers, clearcoats, pigmented coatings, etc., they are not meant toDe limiting. Additionally, while preferred embodiments of stabilizers and antioxidants have been taught, they are not meant to be limiting. Surface modifiers or wetting agents are common additives for liquid paint compositions. Exact mode of operation of these surface modifiers is not known but it is thought that their presence contributes to better adhesion of coating compositions to the surface being coated and helps formation of thin coatings, particularly on metal surfaces. The choice of surface modifiers or wetting agents is dependent upon the type. of surface to be coated. Selection of appropriate surface modifiers will be well within the skill of the artesian. Typical of these surface modifiers are polybutyl acrylate and a wide variety of silicon wetting agents which are commercially available. For many applications of the coating compositions of the invention, particularly high solids compositions, it may be desirable to employ flow control additives to provide sag free coatings. Among numerous such materials,NAD s such as described by Porter S. Porter, Jr., andB.N. McBane, U.S. patent 4,025,474, May 24, 1977 are compatible with these coating compositions. These particle dispersions may be included generally in an amount up to 15 by weight of the total composition.Other types of NAD s such as described by D.L. Maker andS.C. Peng U.S. patent 3,814,721, June 4, 1974 or by S.K.Horvath U.S. application Serial No. 292,853, filed August 14, 1981 also may be included in the coating composition. The coating composition of the invention may also include pigments. The optimal amount of pigment which may be included would be dependent on the particular use of the coating composition as is apparent to one skilled in the art. For example, primers generally contain higher levels of pigment as compared to basecoats of basecoat clearcoat systems and conventional enamels. Selection of the optimal amount of pigment to be included in the composition would be dependent, e.g.. the desired hiding requirements. On the other hand. the clearcoat of such systems is essentially free of pigments. The coating composition can be applied by conventional methods known to those in the art. These methods include roll coating, spray coating. dipping or brushing and of course the particular application technique chosen with the particular substrate to be coated and the environment in which coating operation takes place. Particular preferred techniques for applying these coating compositions, particularly when applying the same to automobiles, is spray coating through the nozzle of the spray gun. The coating composition employing amine aldehydes as the crosslinking agent can be applied as a single component by means of a single component spray gun. On the other hand in spray applying the coating composition employing polyisocyanates as the crosslinking agent. the hydroxy containing urethane modified polyester and the optional linear polyurethane along with other additives such as pigments. U.v absorbers. antioxidants and other nonreactive materials are admixed with a solvent. These materials are fed as one component of a two component system into a spray gun which combines the materials as they are sprayed onto the automotive substrate.The other material is the polyisocyanate crosslinking agent1 which may or may not be cut with a suitable nonreactive solvent. Industrial Applicability It will be apparent from the foregoing that this invention has industrial applicability to automotive vehicles and provides a flexible, durable coating for metal and plastic substrates. The invention will be further understood by referring to the following detailed examples. It should be under stood that the specific examples are presented by way of illuatration and not by way of limitation.
