# Presensitized lithographic printing plates.

## Abstract
A presensitized lithographic printing plate, which com prises a support having a hydrophilic surface. A non silver light sensitive layer capable of having formed therein a lipophilic image panern and a direct positive light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer are provided on the support in that sequence. The non silver light sensitive layer is pro vided with an adjacent hydrophilic colloid layer in which a resin is dispersed in fine particle form. The resin is a copolymer comprising A a recurring unit derived from at least one monomer of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, and B a recurring unit derived from at least one monomer of an aralkyl acrylate and an aralkyl methacrylate.
