# Cultivating implement.

## Abstract
A cultivating implement to be carried by a vehicle com prises a frame 10 having spaced and opposed members 11, 12 between which a tine carrying bar 13 is supported for gyratory motion the direction of which is counter to the direc tion of movement of the carrying vehicle and which derives from and is centred on the axis of axially aligned stub shafts 14, 15 adapted to be driven from a prime mover and sup ported in bearings mounted in or on said opposed members of the frame. Preferably the mutually opposed ends of the stub shafts 14, 15 are cranked in mirror image fashion and the tine carrying bar 13 is supported between bearing arrangements 28, 29 centred on the crank arms. The angle of presentation of the tines to the ground is preferably selectable to accord with the nature of the work to be done and the tine sweeps or shovels to be used therefor.
