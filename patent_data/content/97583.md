# Aluminum corrosion inhibitor composition comprising a graft copolymer and a silicate.

## Abstract
The invention deals with an aluminum corrosion inhibitor composition comprising a graft copolymer and a silicate. This composition comprises an aqueous and or alcohol solution of an unsaturated acid grafted upon a poly oxyalkylene compound plus at least one organic and or inorganic silicate. Such a composition is particularly useful in heat transfer systems such as solar and automatic systems.
