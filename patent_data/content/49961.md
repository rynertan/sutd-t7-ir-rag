# Transmission system for a four wheel drive vehicle.

## Abstract
In a vehicle driven by an internal combustion engine, a transmission system transmits power from the engine to a main pair of driving wheels and optionally to the second pair of driving wheels through an electromagnetic clutch 17 controlled by a selection switch 28 . A brake switch 31 applies a brake signal to control circuit 29 for the clutch 12 when the brake pedal 30 is depressed through a predeter mined stroke, with the result that four wheel drive is automatically established.
