# A VEHICLE TYRE MONITORING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A tyre running hot due to under inflation or other causes radiates heat. This is detected by sensors 4, 27 positioned within the wheel arches. A comparison is made between each sensor output and a norm, such as ambient tempera ture from air temperature detectors 5 or the mean of all the sensor outputs, and significant departure from that norm triggers an alarm 22 . The sensors may each be a detector 27 at the focus of a parabolic reflecting shell 28 shielded by a heat transparent cover 30 , and they will generally be positioned to face the inner side walls of the tyres. Direct wiring to the alarm unit is possible, but with a trailer 2 the signals may be locally encoded, fed by existing wiring 13 to the tractor 1 and there be decoded.
