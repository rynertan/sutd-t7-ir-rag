# Polycrystalline translucent alumina sintered body, a method of producing the same, and a high pressure vapour discharge lamp obtained by using such a sintered body.

## Abstract
A polycrystalline translucent alumina sintered body hav ing a high in line transmission, which is suitable for use as an envelope of a high pressure vapour discharge lamp, is pro duced by adding to alumina powder having a purity of more than 99.8 MgO or a compound forming MgO in an amount of 0.01 0.1 by weight calculated as MgO, La₂O₃ or a com pound forming La₂O₃ in an amount of 0.001 0.05 by weight calculated as La₂O₃, and Y₂O₃ or a compound forming Y₂O₃ in an amount of 0.001 0.05 by weight calculated as Y₂O₃, thoroughly mixing the resulting mixture, shaping the mixture into a desired form and firing the shaped article under vacuum or either an atmosphere of hydrogen gas or dissociated ammonia gas under an oxygen concentration of 10 ¹⁵ 10 ²⁵ atm.
