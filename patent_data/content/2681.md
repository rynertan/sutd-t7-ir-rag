## Description
VANADIUM OXIDE CATALYST, ITS PREPARATION AND ITSUSE IN THE HIGII PRESSURE VAPOR PHASE OXIDATION or LOWER ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS BACKGROUND Or THE INVENTION Processes for producing lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acids such as acetic acid by the vapor phase oxidation of lower aliphatic hydro carbons are known.For example, acetic cld d is prepared by the vapor nhase oxidation of butane according to the following equation C4H10 5 2 02 2CH3COOH H2O However, processes for the oxidation of hydrocarbons in the vapor phase by means of oxygen containing gases have not proven entirely satisfactory primarily due to the excessive formation of undesirable carbon oxides, and to the difficulty in maintaining control of the highly exothermic oxidation reaction. U. S. Patent 3,395,159 provides an improved process wherein the oxidation of hydrocarbons is performed in a reactor system having fused vanadium oxide catalyst coated on the inncr surface of the reactor, which system has the advantage of better temperature control and isothermal operation.The use of early catalysts, such as vanadium pentoxide either supported or unsupported, for the vapor phase oxidation of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons generally results in yields and process efficiencies which fall substantially short of economic potential. Also, the resulting products are often impure due to a lack of selectivity when such catalysts are employed. There are three criteria which are used to judge the performance of a catalyst to be used in the oxidation conversion of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons, for example, butane to corresponding monocarboxylic acids such as acetic acid. For instance, in the oxidation of normal butane, it is highly desirable to have a low overall efficiency to the unsaturated equivalent, i.e., butene and low efficiency to undesirable by products, carbon oxides. Additionally, one desires to have a highly efficient conversion of any butene formed to acetic acid and finally a very rapid reaction rate of the butene to acetic acid to prevent buildup of butene within the reactor. OBJECTS AND SU1AIZY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a general object of the present invention is to find a catalyst which meets the above three criteria in a satisfactory manner.Another object is a process for preparing this catalyst. A more specific object is the use of the catalyst in a process for the production of acetic acid by the vapor phase oxidation of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons in a high pressure environment, and in the hydrocarbon rich region. These objects are achieved by a process for preparing acetic acid by the vapor phase oxidation of the lower aliphatic hydrocarbon such as butane, hich process comprises reacting the lower aliphatic hydrocarbon and an oxygen containing gas in the vapor phase, in the presence of steam and above atmospheric pressures with a catalytic amount of a decomposed salt of vanadium and multibasic organic acid preferably vanadyl oxalate. One essence of this invention lies in the discovery that reduced vanadium oxide catalysts prepared from a precursor comprising salts of vanadium and multibasic organic acids when utilized in the vapor phase oxidation of a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon such as butane, with steam and high pressure conditions in the hydrocarbon rich region realizes high efficiency to acetic acid low overall efficiency to butenes and rapid conversion of recycled butenes to acetic acid which avoids butene buildup within the reactor. It is not new that vanadium salts derived from the reaction of vanadium with multicarboxylic acids can be decomposed to form reduced vanadium oxides, but the marked superiority of vanadium oxides formed in this manner as catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation to produce, for example, acetic acid has not been known heretofore. For example, butene formation, which is an index of catalyst quality in this reaction, is markedly less with the present catalysts as compared with others which are formed even by such closely related methods as decomnosing vanadyl formate. The reason for these differences is not known. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the ability to obtain decreased selectivities to carbon oxides by lowering temperature in oxidizingC4 hydrocarbons over reduced vanadium catalysts is limited due to a competing reaction of catalyst oxidation at low temperatures when operating at above atmospheric pressures, i.e., safe operational minimum temperature limits exist no catalyst oxidation with high pressure conditions. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED E1MB0DI1ENTS The preparation of the catalyst of the instant invention begins by preparing a water soluble salt of vanadium with a multibasic organic acid such as oxalic, tartaric, etc. Techniques for accomplishing this are well known in the art. For example, solutions of oxalic acid with water can be added to suspensions of V 205 in water with vigorous stirring. Evaporators can be utilized to recover the crystalline salts and salts decomposed under inert atmosphere with high temperatures. In the process using the catalyst of the present invention, a lower aliphatic hydrocarbon is reacted with an oxygen containing gas in the presence of a catalytically effective amount of the abovedescribed reduced vanadium oxide supported or unsupported catalyst to produce acetic acid. By lower aliphatic hydrocarbon is meant any saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms. These lower aliphatic hydrocarbons include alkanes, alkenes and alkynes such as ethylene, propylene, butene, propane, butane, pentene, octane and their isomers.Particularly preferred aliphatic hydrocarbons are the alkanes and alkenes including propane, butane, butene, isobutane, isobutene and mixtures thereof. The production of acetic acid from butane can give particularly advantageous results. By the term reduced vanadium oxide or reduced vanadium pentoxide is meant a vanadium oxide in which the average vanadium ion valency is less than 5. is lower oxidation state of vanadium ions is an essential feature of the present invention catalyst. This is based on the observation that vanadium pentoxide i.e., the catalyst containing vanadium ions with a valence of 5 is not an active catalyst under the process conditions to be described, and it is, therefore, advantageous to exclude vanadium pentoxide from the catalyst compositions to the greatest extent possible. The reduced vanadium oxides employed in the catalyst of the present invention are all intermediate in average oxidation states, i.e., between V 205 and V203. Although the initial charge can contain V205 and V203, X ray diffraction studies confirm that vanadium oxide catalysts operable in the process are effectively expressed empirically asV3O5, 5 4 7 5 9 V6O11, , V7013, V204 and or V60 13The average valence of the vanadium ions in these oxides generally ranges from 3 to about 4.5. The oxygen necessary as a reactant in the present process may be from practically any molecular oxygen containing gas such as molecular oxygen or air. Also, the molecular oxygen containing gas may be one wherein molecular oxygen is mixed in varying amounts with an inert diluent gas such as nitrogen, argon, or a carbon oxide. The lower aliphatic hydrocarbon and oxygen containing gas can be reacted within a wide range of molar ratios. However, it is an essential feature of the invention process that the quantity of oxygen gas in the feed stream he the least required to convert efficiently the hydrocarbon stream to acetic acid consistent with necessary temperature control and retention of catalyst activity. It is important that the vanadium oxide catalyst is not oxidized to vanadium pentoxide.Even the presence of a small amount of vanadium pentoxide is effective in reducing the yield of acetic acid. The quantity of oxygen gas in the feed stream usually is maintained in the range from about 0.05 and 1 mol mole of lower aliphatic hydrocarbon.At elevated pressures, the preferred range is from about 0.05 to about 0.30. The present process should be carried out above atmospheric pressures, generally from greater than 1 to about 50, typically from greater than 1 to about 30 bars, and preferably from about 5 to about 20 bars. It is, of course, highly desirable to operate the instant process under high pressure conditions for then simple cooling can render the recycle stream of butane and butene and the take off stream of acetic acid liquid. Furthermore, high pressure operation realizes higher butane oxidation rates. With experiments conducted at atmospheric pressure, no catalyst oxidation was apparent even when the reactor temperatures were as low as 220 C.However, when high pressure operation was commenced, as mentioned before, the ability to obtain decreased selectivities to carbon oxides by decreasing temperature in oxidizing C4 hydrocarbons over reduced vanadium catalysts was limited due to a competing reaction of catalyst oxidation and therefore deactivation, at low temperatures. In the pressure range of from about 5 to about 10 bars, signifiant catalyst oxidation may occur from about 220 to about 240 C. Deactivation is detectable in the 240 to 250 C. transition range.However, in reactor runs about 2500C., the catalysts of the instant invention appear to be stable to oxidation under given reaction conditions. Visual examination of used catalyst pellets following a series of experiments at both high and low temperature conditions, suggests that the catalyst activation deactivation process is reversible under reaction conditions with possible minor hysteresis losses. In a preferred embodiment of the process, water is included in the feedstream in a quantity between about 0.1 and 2.0 mole per mole of lower aliphatic hydrocarbon preferably 0.5 to 1.2. The presence of water vapor in the oxidation reaction system can increase the yield of acetic acid by as much as 10 in the case where the hydrocarbon feed stream is normal butane. Imortantly, steam which heretofore has been used in reactions such as oxidation reactions, for temperature control, i.e., to function as a diluent and control hot spots within the reactor not only does that in the instant oxidation reaction but also, since the proposed improved catalysts for this oxidation of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons are generally in a reduced state, the steam serendipitously 1 helps maintain the vanadium oxides in a reduced and active state and 2 additionally increases selectivity of the catalyst to the desired end product, i.e., acetic acid. This, of course, was not realized in the prior art because either 1 the catalyst systems utilized in the vapor phase oxidation of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons were in a fully oxidized state or 2 the reactions were conducted at atmospheric or below pressures wherein the catalyst oxidation does not take place.In low pressure operations, it is believed that the reduction of the catalyst by the butane and the oxidation of the butane by air or oxygen vis a vis the oxidation of the catalyst by air or oxygen is such that catalyst deactivation is not a noticeable problem with low temperature operations. The present process is carried out a temperature generally between 220 and about 400 C., typically from greater than 240 to about 3500C., and preferably from greater than 250 to about 3000C The contact time of the reactants with the catalyst is generally between about 0.1 and 100 seconds, typically between about 0.25 and 50 seconds.By contact time as used herein is meant the contact time adjusted to 25 C. and 1 atmospheric pressure i.e., standard temperature and pressure, denotedSTP . Thus, the contact time is calculated by dividing the volume of the catalyst bed including voids by the volume per unit time flow rate of the reactants at STP. By using the catalyst of the present invention the process may be carried out continuously and the catalyst may be present in various forms such as in one or more fixed beds or as a fluidized system. Portions of the reactants which do not undergo reaction may be recycled if necessary.Selected intermediate products, such as butenes and acetaldehyde, are preferably recycled also. The desired acetic acid product may be separated from any impurities by condensation followed by fractionation and aqueous or non aqueous extraction of the product from the unreacted lower aliphatic hydrocarbon.In this specification, the terms conversion and efficiency are defined as follows moles lower aliphatic hydro carbon or oxygen converted conversion, x 100 moles lower aliphatic hydro carbon or oxygen fed moles comnonent i formed x carbon atoms per mole of carbon effi component i ciency to com x 100 ponent i total moles of carbon in all products analyzed Acetic acid is generally produced by the present process with a conversion based on oxygen generally of at least 90 percent, often at least about 95 percent, a conversion based on lower aliphatic hydrocarbon which, as noted above, is present in substantial excess generally of at least about 1 percent, typically from about 3 to about 5 percent, and a carbon efficiency of generally at least about 50 percent, typically at least about 55 percent, often at least about 60 percent with recycled intermediates. The recovery of the product stream and the separation of the acetic acid from the acetaldehyde, maleic acid and other by products can be accomplished by conventional procedures. U. S. Patent 3,624,148 describes a method for the separation of acetic acid from maleic acid. A number of multibasic organic acids may be used to prepare the desired water soluble vanadium salt such as oxalic acid, tartaric aci, ric acid, citric acid, malonic acid, glutinic acid adipic acid, lactic acid, and the like. Thy preferred acid is oxalic acid. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples. All parts and perceotages in the examples as well as in the specification and claims are by weight unless otherwise specified. The reactants and other specific ingredients are presented as being typical, and various modifications can be devised in view of the foregoing disclosure within the scope of the invention. CATALYST PREPARATION The following example illustrates the preferred method for making the catalyst of the instant invention. EXAD1PLE I To a suspension of 182 g of V205 in 800 ml of water is added 378 g of oxalic acid, H2C204.2Ii90, dissolved in 800 ml of water in small portions with vigorous stirring. After all the V205 has dissolved, the deep blue vanadyl oxalate solution is filtered, and the water removed from the recovered filtrate on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The recovered blue solid vanadyl oxalate is placed in an inert atmosphere furnace and the furnace purged with nitrogen for several minutes. The temperature is then raised to 400 C. over a period of about 4 hours, kept at 400 C, for about 16 hours, and then cooled to room temperature still under a nitrogen atmosphere.The recovered powder is mixed with 2 weight a graphite and pressed into 3.12 mm diameter x 3.12 mm long pellets. The procedure is repeated until sufficient catalyst is produced to make a catalyst charge. The following three examples illustrate other methods for preparing reduced vanadium oxide catalysts for the oxidation of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons. EXAITLE II To 182 g of V2O5 slurried in 1 liter of 90 formic acid at about 50 C. is added dropwise with rapid stirring over a period of two hours, 60 ml of 64eá hydrazine in water. After addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional two hours at about 800C. The resulting green, fine crystalline precipitate is collected by filtration, washed several times with formic acid, acetone, and air dried. The recovered vanadyl formate is placed in an inert atmosphere furnace and the furnace purged with nitrogen for several minutes. The temperature is then raised to 4000C. over a period of about 4 hours, kept at 4000C. for about 16 hours, and then rapidly cooled to room temperature still under a nitrogen atmosphere. The recovered powder is mixed with 2 weight graphite and pressed into 3.12 mm diameter x 3.12 mm long pellets. The procedure is repeated until sufficient catalyst is produced to make a catalyst charge. EXAMPLE III About 900 g of V205 are mixed with 2 weight graphite and pressed into 3.12 mm diameter x 3.12 mm long pellets. The pellets are placed in a controlled atmosphere furnace and the furnace purged with hydrogen. Under a stedly flow of hydrogen the temperature is raised to 500 C., held at the temperature for about 5 hours, and then cooled to room temperature still under a steady stream of hydrogen. The extent of reduction can be measured by analyzing for water in the vent gas stream. EXAMPLE IV To 200 g of vanadyl sulfate dissolved in 1 liter of water is added with stirring ammonium hydroxide with ice bath cooling until a pH of about 5 6 is reached. The resulting brown precipitate of vanadyl hydroxide is collected by filtration, washed several times with water, and dried at 110 0C. in a forced draft oven. The dried powder is mixed with 2 weight graphite and pressed into 3.12 mm diameter x 3.12 mm long pellets. The pellets are placed in an inert atmosphere furnace and the furnace purged with nitrogen. The temperature is then raised to 400 C. over a period of about 4 hours, held at that temperature for about 16 hours, and then cooled to room temperature still under a nitrogen atmosphere. The procedure is repeated until sufficient catalyst is produced to make a catalyst charge. EXSilPLES V VIII The following examples comparatively illustrate the superior results utilized by the preferred catalyst of the instant invention in the high pressure, high temperature vapor phase oxidation of n butane to acetic acid as compared to the reduced vanadium catalyst prepared by prior art methods. A 19.1 mm schedule 40 steel pipe is employed to hold the catalyst charge. The pipe is about 1.5 m long with an inside diameter of about 21 mm. The usual catalyst charge is about 250 cm of pelleted catalyst. The catalyst is usually diluted heterogeneously with an equal volume of about the same size pellets of silicon carbide. The reactor is heated to the desired temperature using pressurized steam. Flow rates of the lower aliphatic hydrocarbon and air or oxygen are determined by mass flowmeters. Steam is introduced as water at a known flow rate and flashed to steam with the flow rate of steam calculated by application of the ideal gas law. After the flow rates are stabilized, the temperature of the reactor initially about 2400C. is then slowly raised until the desired oxygen conversion rate is achieved. Material balances are then obtained at this temperature.Reactions are conducted under pressure so that coolincT water can be used to condense the butane recycle stream.Analysis of the vent gas stream entails passing the reaction products plus unreacted lower aliphatic hydrocarbon and steam through a water cooled condenser after leaving the heated reaction zone to remove the liquid products and water from the vent stream. The vent stream leaving the condenser, now containing primarily lower aliphatic hydrocarbons, carbon oxides, and nitrogen if air is used is analyzed by standard gas chromatographic techniques. Components analyzed for include butane, butenes, acetaldehyde, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The liquid product is collected at the end of the run and analyzed by standard gas chromatographic techniques. Components analyzed for include acetic acid, acetaldehyde, propionic acid, maleic acid, formaldehyde, formic acid, and acetone.

The water is removed on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. The spheres are placed in a 5 cm diameter Pyrex tube, the tube purged with nitrogen for several minutes, and then heated to 200 C. The temperature is then increased to 400 C. over a period of about 5 hours, held at that temperature for about 16 hours, and then cooled to room temperature still under a nitrogen atmosphere.

After the reaction is completed the reaction mixture is held at 160 C for an additional one hour. The resulting blue solid vanadyl oxalate is removed, placed in a 5 cm diameter quartz tube, and the tube purged with nitrogen and then heated to 200 C. The temperature is then increased to 4250C.over a period of about 5 hours held at that temperature for about 14 hours, and then cooled to room temperature still under a nitrogen atmosphere.This procedure is repeated until about 1360 g of reduced vanadium oxide is recovered.
