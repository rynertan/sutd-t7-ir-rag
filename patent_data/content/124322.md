## Abstract
A V belt transmission is disclosed in which an endless me tallic belt 3 is provided thereon with a large number of V shaped metallic members 4, 4, ... disposed in a line in the lengthwise direction of the metallic belt, the belt and the mem bers forming, as a whole, a V belt assembly 2 that is applied between a driving V pulley 1 and a driven V pulley so as to effect power transmission therebetween. There is a large number of intermediate members 6, 6, ... positioned inside the metallic belt interposed each between respective adjacent metallic members with at least one of two receiving surfaces 8, 8 receiving a corresponding intermediate member 6 , these receiving surfaces being of such a shape as to give a wedge effect for applying a pressing force, in the lengthwise direction of the metallic belt, to said corresponding intermedi ate member when each of the metallic members is brought into engagement with and pushed outwards by a V groove 1a, of each of the V pulleys 1, .
