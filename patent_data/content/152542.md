## Description
Pyrrol 3 carboxylic acids having central analgesic activity The present invention refers to compounds having the formula EMI1.1 whereinR is CH3, n C4Hg, benzyl or o Cl benzylR1 is Cl, CH3, OCH3R2 is H or ClR3 is H or C1 with the proviso that when R CH3 and R2 R3 H,R1 is different from chlorine and the corresponding salts with inorganic cations or deriving from non toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases, such as primary, secondary or tertiary amines or aminoacids. Another object of the invention is provided by a process for the preparation of compounds of formulaI. Finally, the invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions having analgesic action made up by, or comprising as the active principle, at least one of the compounds of formula I. Said compounds are, in fact, endowed with an high analgesic activity of the central type while being devoid of addiction side effects, so frequent in this class of analgesics. Compounds having a similar structure to I and active as analgesics or antiinflammatories, are known. For instance, German Patent No. 2,102,746 claims the 5 p chlorobenzoyl 1, 4 dimethyl pyrrol 2 acetic acid Zomepirac and European patent applicationsNo. 32314 and 72013 disclose 5 aroyl pyrrol 2 acetic acids differently substituted in positions 1 and or 4, but they are also devoid of substituents in position 3. Zomepirac is a typical peripheral analgesic which, differently from compounds I, inhibits the cy clooxygenase and the prostaglandinesynthetase. As far as the Zomepirac derivatives described inEuropean patent applications No. 23314 and 72013 are concerned, no test is given showing a central effect and such compounds are particularly defined as antiinflammatory agents and Zomepirac type compounds . The central analgesic action of compounds I ,whi ch are chemically different from the known similar aroylpyrrole derivatives mainly because of the lack of acidic groups in the chain in position 2 and the presence of the carboxy group in position 3, must be therefore considered as surprising. According to the present invention, the compounds of formula I can be conveniently prepared according to the following reaction scheme EMI3.1 wherein R4 represents a C1 C4 alkyl residue. The hydrolysis of the diester II with equimolar amounts of sodium hydroxyde in aqueous isopropanol occurs selectively and in good yields at the level of the acetic carboxy group linked in position 2 of the pyrrole nucleus. The reaction course is unequivocally confirmed by the NMR spectrum of compounds I, which clearly shows the presence of a methyl group in position 2 of the pyrrole ring. The following examples illustrate the invention without limiting it in any way.EXAMPLE 1 1,4 Dimethyl 5 3,4 dichlorobenzoyl 3 ethoxyCar bonyl pyrrol 2 acetic acid III, R CH3 R1, R2 Cl R3 H R4 C2H5 42.6 Grams 0.1 moles of ethyl 1,4 dimethyl 5 3,4 dichlorobenzoyl 3 ethoxycarbonyl pyrrol 2 ace tate, are suspended in 300 ml of an isopropanol wa ter 80 20 mixture, which is heated to reflux.100 M1 of IN sodium hydroxide solution are then ad ded dropwise, in 30 minutes after 2 hours at reflux, the solution is cooled and the isopropanol is evaporated under reduced pressure. By acidification with hydrochloric acid to pH 3 a precipitate is obtained, which is filtered, washed with water, dried and crystallized from ethyl acetate, to give 25.5 g 75 yield of a product having melting point 156 158 C. In a similar proce dure, the products reported in Table 1 are obtained.

The pharmaco toxicological properties of the reference compounds will be hereinafter reported. The analgesic activity of the compounds of for mula I, administered by the oral route has been determined by means of the following tests Phenylquinone test in mice Hendershot and Forsa ith J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 123, 237 1959 Hot plate test Male albino mice, treated with increasing doses of the compound under test, are placed on a thermostatized plate at 550C. The time necessary for the mouse to react to the painful stimulus is then measured. An effective dose 50 ED50 is defined as the dose inducing a 50 increase of the reaction time, with respe ct to control animals. The acute toxicity per os has been studied in the mouse and in the rat and expressed as LD50 at the 14th observation day. The results of the above tests are reported in Table 3. The doses shown in the Table are in mg kg per os. As a comparison codeine hydrochloride is used, which in said tests gave the following results LD50 mouse per os 300 mg kgED50 phenylquinone 5.6 mg kgED50 hot plate 25 mg kg The remarkable activity of the compounds of formula I in the hot plate test shows that the analgesic activity of said compounds is of the central type. The compounds of formula I, differently from codeine hydrochloride, do not induce the phenomenon of Jumping by Nalorphine in the mouse, which excludes that said compounds could induce physical addiction. The compounds of formula I are moreover unequivocally different from known compounds having similar structure, i.e. such as Zomepirac, because they are endowed with central analgesic activity and devoid of activity inhibiting the cyclooxygena se and the prostaglandinsynthetase. As a result, the compounds of formula I are devoid of ulcerogenic activity and do not cause the formation of leukotrienes, responsible of the anaphylattoid rea ctions so common with Zomepirac and with other com pounds having analgesic antiinflammatory activities. The present invention refers also to all the industrially applicable aspects connected with the use of compounds of formula I as therapeutic agents. An essential aspect of the invention is therefore provided by pharmaceutical composition containing, as the active principle, predetermined and therapeutically effective amounts of at least one of the compounds of formula I or salts thereof, in addition to optional excipients of conventional use in pharmaceutical technique, useful for the treatment of acute and chronic pain deriving from neoplasias, surgical operations, headache, toothache. The compounds of the present invention can be administered by the oral, rectal or parenteral rou te, for instance in form of capsules, tablets, sugar coated tablets, syrups, drops, suppositories, microclisms, ampoules. The following formulations are cited as an example a tablets containing from 25 to 500 mg of a com pound of formula I, with excipients and disgre gating agents commonly used in pharmaceutical technique b suppositories containing from 50 to 1000 mg of a compound of formula I c ampoules for intramuscular or endovenous use con taining from 25 to 1000 mg of a compound of for mula I, in forma of a salt thereof, having a pH around physiological values.
