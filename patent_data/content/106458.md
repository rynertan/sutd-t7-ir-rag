# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device including a MIS field effect transistor.

## Abstract
A method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, comprises the steps of sequentially forming a gate insulation film 12 , a gate electrode film 13 of polycrystalline silicon and a self alignment film 14 of silicon nitride on a semiconductor substrate 11 having one conductivity type, patterning the gate electrode film 13 and the self alignment film 14 in an identical electrode pattern, ion implanting an impurity of an opposite conductivity type into the substrate 11 using the silicon nitride pattern 14 as a mask, thereby forming source and drain regions 15a, 15b , forming an insulation layer 16 on the entire surface of the substrate 11 including the silicon nitride pattern 14 , performing anneal ing, removing the remaining insulation layer 16 which is located on the silicon nitride pattern 14 , removing the silicon nitride pattern 14 so as to expose the gate electrode pattern 13 , and forming a metal film 18 on the exposed gate electrode pattern 13 .
