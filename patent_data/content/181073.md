# Method for controlling the injection and concentration of a supersaturation of exotic atoms deeply into a solid material.

## Abstract
A method for controlling the injection of a supersatura tion of exotic atoms 1 comprises previously preparing a parent material 2 with buried exotic phases 1 consisting of Ge or Si, irradiating the parent material 2 with electron beams 3 , and forming injection regions of supersaturation of the exotic atoms 1 to control the concentration profile of the exotic atoms. The method can control the distribution of concentration of exotic atoms 1 by irradiating electron beams 3 of high energy.
