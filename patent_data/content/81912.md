# Solid shaped articles.

## Abstract
Solid shaped articles, particularly pharmaceutical dosage forms, are prepared by freezing in a mould a composition comprising a predetermined amount of chemical eg. pharmaceutical and a solution of carrier material and then subliming solvent from the frozen composition. The side wall or walls of the mould make an angle with the vertical of at least 5 at the surface of the composition. This enables shaped articles of constant thickness to be produced with minimum sublimation times.
