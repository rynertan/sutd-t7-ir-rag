# PROCESS FOR THE DYEING OF POLYMERS OF ETHYLENE

## Abstract
A process for the dyeing of polymers of ethylene is dis closed. The process involves contacting articles of the polym er with an aqueous dyebath containing a basic dye in a con centration of at least 0.4 g l and at a pH of 5.0 7.5. The tempera ture of the aqueous dyebath is at least 90 C. The article is maintained in contact with the dyebath for at least 20 seconds. The polymer of ethylene is a blend of 80 99 parts of a homo polymer of ethylene or copolymer of ethylene and at least one C₄ C₁₀ higher alpha olefin with 1 20 parts of a direct or graft copolymer of an alpha olefin having carboxylic acid, carboxy lic acid anhydride, ionomeric or OH groups. Dyed polymers of ethylene are obtained.
