# Crate with partitioning grid.

## Abstract
A crate 1 for bottles with cylindrical body portions has double skinned corner portions 7 which define with portions 13 of an internal partitioning grid 5 corner compartments 6a for bottles. The inner skin 12 of the corner portion is formed with vertical ribs 14 adjacent the grid portions 13. These ribs, which are interconnected with the outer skin 8 of the corner portion to form hollow columns 14a therewith, strengthen the corner portions and allow the spacing of the skins thereof to be reduced so that the size of the compartment can be increased for given external crate dimensions, and as the ribs are located adjacent the partitioning portions 13 they occupy space which would otherwise be free and do not reduce the effective size of the corner compartments.

## Description
Crates. This invention relates to crates, and more particularly to substantially rectangular crates for a plurality of articles, such as bottles, having cylindrical body portions. It is known to employ double skinned side walls in such crates to provide increased structural strength.This, however, has the disadvantage of reducing the useful interior cross sectional area of the crate for a given external cross sectional area thereof.. This disadvantage is particularly significant where an increase in the external side dimensions of the crate is undesirable for example because the crates are required to be stackable on a pallet of given dimensions. In order to reduce this disadvantage the present invention includes a substantially rectangular crate for a plurality of articles having cylindrical body portions, said crate having a base and side wall means and being provided with an internal partitioning grid, said side wall means including corner portions, each of which defines with adjacent mutually perpendicularly extending portions of the partitioning grid a compartment for one of said articles and includes adjacent each of said partitioning grid portions a hollow column extending vertically relative to said base. This invention also includes a substantially rectangular crate for a plurality of articles having cylindrical body portions, said crate having a base and side wall means and being provided with an internal partitioning grid, said side wall means including doubleskinned corner portions, each of which defines with adjacent mutually perpendicularly extending portions of the partitioning grid a compartment for one of said articles and comprises an outer skin having mutually perpendicular portions and an inner skin spaced from said outer skin and formed adjacent each of said partitioning grid portions with a rib extending away from the outer skin and vertically relative to said base. It will be understood that the columns or ribs of the corner portions strengthen the corner portions1 and thereby allow the spacing apart of the inner and outer skins at locations other than adjacent the grid partitioning portions to be correspondingly reduced, but by being formed adjacent the partitioning grid portions can be dimensioned so as to be spaced from the body portions of articles in the compartments of the crate. In order that the invention may be better understood, an embodiment thereof, which is given by way of example only, will now be described, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows a bottle crate, the right hand side of the Figure being a bottom plan view and the left hand side of the Figure being a part sectioned top plan view, the section being taken along the line A A of Figure 2 Figure 2 is a part sectioned side elevation of the same crate, the section being taken along the line B B of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a part sectioned end elevation of the same crate, the section being taken along the line C of Figur . In the drawings there is illustrat d a substan a l re angular fur a pluralit of bottles not shown having cyl ndr cal body portions. The crate 1 has a base 2 and side wall eans 3 formed with a doubleskin extending upwardly from the bese to an upper rim 4 around the open top of the crate An internal partitioning grid 5 is provider to define compartments 6 within the crate, a separate compartment being provided for each bottle. The side wall means 3 includes double skinned corner portions 7, best shown in the section in Figure 1, each of which comprises an outer skin 8 having mutually perpendicular portions 9 and 10, which are interconnected in the illustrated crate by a curved portion 11, and an inner skin 12 spaced from the outer skin 8.Each corner portion 7 defines with adjacent mutually perpendicularly extending portions 13 of the partitioning grid 5 a corner compartment 6a for one of the bottles and the inner skin 12 is formed adjacent each of these partitioning grid portions 13 with a rib 14 extending away from the outer skin 8 and vertically relative to the base 2. The ribs extend from the base 2 and terminate short of the upper rim 4. The ribs 14 are interconnected with the outer skin 8 to form hollow columns 14a extending vertically from the base 2. In the illustrated crate, the ribs 14 of each corner portion are connected to the outer skin by stay members 24 at their remote edge portions only so that the corner portion is completely hollow.As can be seen by the circles 15 drawn in Figure 1 to represent the cross section of the body portions of two bottles, the provision of the ribs 14 adjacent the grid portions 13 whilst strengthening the corner portions does not decrease the effective size of the compartments since the ribs occupy space in the compartments which would be otherwise free irie strengthening effect of the ribs enab es the spacing of the inner and outer skins of the corner portions to be reduced without affecting the overall strength of the corner portions, and thus the size of the compartment to be increase. Whilst it away b advantageous to have the inner skin diverge from the outer skin away from the upper rim 4 in order to provide a more frigid structure and to facilitate moulding, the distance between adjacent corner portions available for division into compartments, may be increased, for given external crate dimensions, by making the inner skin. parallel, or substantially parallel, to the out r skin at at least central vertical planes of the corner compartments.It may, however, only be required to provide this increase in one direction only, for example te direction of the longer sides of the crate, and as showy in the illustrated crate this can be achieved by making the inner skin parallel to the outer skin at the central vertical plane extending through the shorter sides of the crate only the plane D D of compartment 6a in Figure l. The strength of the corner portions can advantageously be further increased as shown in the illustrated crate by curving the inner skin 12 opposite the curved portion 11 of the outer skin with a greater radius and over a greater extent than the portion 11 to increase the spacing of the skins Again, it will be appreciated that this does not decrease the effective size of the corner compartments. The side wall means include double skinned side wall portions which extend between the corner portions 7, the longer and shorter side wall portions being referenced 16 and 17 respectively in the drawings.These side wall portions comprise outer and inner skins 18 and 19 respectively. The partitioning grid 5 end t wards the side s and in iew of the foregoing description wall pertions may be strengthene tion of ribs, similar to ribs 14, d ent ne of the grid portions 20.In the s a d embod e s ch rib 21 is formed in each l n r side all porti 16 midway therealout Openings 22 exten ing through the side wall means 3 form handles for the crate and apart from these openings 22 and recesses 23 formed above them the exterior of the crate formed by the outer skins 8 and 18 Is smooth and continuous, The inner skins 12 of the corner portions 7 are also continucus but the inner skin 19 of the side wall portions which are also connected to the outer skins 18 thereof br stay members 2L extending therebetween and strengthening the construction of the side wall portions1 are apertured.The inner sins of the longer side wall portions are shown having substantially rectangular apertures 25 extending between toy and bottom strips of the side wall portions such that he longer side wall portions are continuously double skinned at their top and bottom. The inner skins of the shorter side wall portions are provided with apertures 26 shown extending from the bottom of the inner skins and terminating short of openings 22. The formation of apertures 25 and 26 provides a substantial saving in material and is possible without weakening the construction of the side wall portions a significant amount. The bas 2 of the crate is also apertured and shown as a lattice grid which is provided with a plurality of downwardly extending formations 27 shown as arranged in three rows and four columns, adjacent rows and columns of the formations defining therebetween respective channels 28 Figurs 3 and 20, Figure2 . Each channel is of a width such that the upper rims 4, which as will be noted form Figure 1 are s bstantially uniform thickness, of adjacent s de wall portions of two similar crates arranged side b s de and in stacked relationship with the crate can de lo ed therein. This prowision evables the crates to s stacked other than in direct ver cal al gnment and provides for stable stacking. As can be best appreciated from Figure 1, the ribs 14 of corner portions are adjacent the sides of channels 28 and the outer ones of channels 29 and the ribs 21 of the longer side wall portions are located centrally in the intermediate channel 29. Accordingly when stacked in the manner described above the adjacent apper rims of side by side lower crates located in a channel 28 or 29 extend close to or directly under a rib 4 or 23 at each end ol the channel. This provision enables the crates in the lowest layer of a stack to carrv ne load of the stack better. The illustrated crate is injection.moulded in plastics material with the partitioning grid 5 integral with the side wall means.
