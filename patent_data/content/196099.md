# Preparation process of meth acrylamide.

## Abstract
A catalyst useful in the practice of a process, in which meth acrylamide is prepared through the hydration reaction between meth acrylonitrile and water in a suspended liquid phase bed of a Raney copper catalyst, has been obtained by leaching a Raney copper alloy in the presence of the Raney copper catalyst which has been deteriorated. The above useful catalyst has higher performances, compared with a catalyst obtained by conventionally leaching the Raney copper alloy alone, has satisfactory handling properties in settling and filtering, and can significantly reduced the amount of catalyst to be discarded.
