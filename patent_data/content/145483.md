# Picture correcting apparatus for use with in line type color picture tube.

## Abstract
In a deflection yoke of self convergence system for use with in line type color picture tube, the intensity of a magne tic field, which causes the change in impendance of coils of saturable reactors respectively connected in series with two horizontal deflecting coils, is increased so that the variation rate of the inductance expressed in terms of a differential coefficient has the relationship of ϑe ϑm 0.5 wherein ϑm is a differential coefficient around the center of the picture where the degree of vertical deflection is very small and ϑe is a differential coefficient at top and bottom sides of the pic ture where the degree of vertical deflection is maximum. In one embodiment, an auxiliary coil connected to the vertical deflection coils is employed in each of the saturable reac tors so as to increse the intensity of the magnetic field appli ed to the saturable reactors. In another embodiments, me tallic member s is are arranged to be close to the saturable reactors so as to reduce reluctance.
