EXAMPLE 10 To a solution of 6.4 g of l methylpropyl 2,2 dichloro 2 Cdiethoxyphosphinyl acetate in 15Q ml of ether was added 14 ml. of 1.6 M solution of n butyl lithium in hexane at 7Q over 15 min. The solution was allowed to warm to 100C before adding 60 ml. of 0.5 N HC1 solution at 100 to 0 C. The phases were separated and the organic phase washed with water and 5 NaHCO3 solution. The solution was dried and stripped to give 5.0 g of l methylpropyl 2 chloro 2 diethoxyphosphinyl acetate as a pale yellow oil ND25 1,4452.NMR CDCl3 0.8 1.9 Cm, 14.7H 4.2 4.8 m, 4.5H,JPCH 18 Hz 5.0 5.4 m, 0.8H .Mass spectrum showed an m l peak at 287. Loss of 56 C4H8 gave a strong peak at 230. Using suitable modifications of the procedures described in the preceding examples, the compounds of Formula I described in Tables 1 and 2 can be prepared.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, emulsions, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly.Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few pints to several hundred gallons per acre.High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 5 to 99 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate porportions Active Percent bs Weight Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Emulsions, Solutions including ErnuI5ifi able Concentrates 5 50 40 95 O15 Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 1 95 5 99 0 15High Strength Compositions 90 99 0 10 0 2 Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound.Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd. Edn., Dorland Books, Caldwell, N.J.The denser diluents are preferred for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide , 2nd Edn., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at OOC. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , Allured Publ.Corp., Ridgwood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely andWood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents ,Chemical Publ. Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E.Browning, Agglomeration , Chemical Engineering,Dec. 4, 1967, pp. 147ff. and Perry s ChemicalEngineer s Handbook , 4th. Edn., McGraw Hill, N.Y., 1963, pp. 8 59ff.

They can be used for the selective control of weeds in crops, such as cotton, soybeans and sugarbeets, or wherever general weed control is required, such as on industrial sites, railroad rights of way and locations adjacent to croplands. The precise amount of the compounds of the present invention to be used in any given situation will vary according to the particular end result desired, the use involved, the plant and soil involved, the formulation used, the mode of application, prevailing weather conditions, foliage density and like factors. Since so many variables play a role, it is not possible to state a rate of application suitable for all situations.Broadly speaking, the compounds of the invention are used at levels of about 0.1 to about 15 kilograms per hectare. The lower rates in this range will generally be selected for selective weed control in crops, on lighter soils, soils low in organic matter content, or in situations where tflaxaaum persistence is not necessary. In many situations it is advantageous to incorporate these chemicals with the soil.

Herbicidal activity of the subject compounds was discovered in a number of greenhouse tests, as described below.Test A Seeds of crabgrass Digitaria spp. , barnyardgrass Echinochloa crusgalli , wild oats Avena fatua , cassia Cassia tora , morningglory Ipomoea hederacea ,cocklebur Xanthium spp. , sorghum, corn, soybean, rice, wheat and nut sedge tubers were planted in a growth medium and treated preemergence with the chemicals dissolved in a non phytotoxic solvent.At the same time, cotton having five leaves including cotyledonary ones , bushbeans with the third trifoliate leaf expanding, crabgrass with two leaves, barnyardgrass with two leaves, wild oats with one leaf, cassia with three leaves including cotyledonary ones , morningglory with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , cocklebur with four leaves including the cotyledonary ones , sorghum with three leaves, corn with three leaves, soybean with two cotyledonary leaves, rice with two leaves, wheat with one leaf, and nutsedge with three five leaves were sprayed. Treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, then all species were compared to controls and visually rated for response to treatment. Ratings for compounds tested by this procedure are recorded in Table A. The ratings are based on a numerical scale extending from 0 no injury, to 10 complete kill. The accompanying letters have the following meanings C chlorosis necrosis,B burn, G growth retardation, E emergence inhibition, H formative effect, and X axillary stimulation.

Treated plants and controls were maintained in a greenhouse for sixteen days, whereupon all species were compared to controls and visually rated for response to treatment. The ratings are based on a numrical scale extending from O no injury, to 10 complete kill.The accompanying descriptive symbols have the following meanings B burn G growth retardation C chlorosis necrosis D defoliation 6Y abscised buds or flowers E emergence inhibition and H formative effects,The ratings for the compounds tested by this procedure are presented in Table B. tt will be seen that certain of the compounds tested have utility for selective preemergence weed control in soybeans.
