# Mould portion for use in moulding molten glass.

## Abstract
A mould portion 10 has one or more inner surfaces 16,18 arranged to define a portion of a mould cavity 14 in which molten glass can be moulded. A rod 20 of a material having a higher thermal conductivity than the remainder of the mould portion extends from a region 22 of the mould portion requiring enhanced heat extraction into a recess 24 in an outer surface 26 of the mould portion. A passage 28 extends through the mould portion 10 and enters the recess 24 . Cooling fluid, for example air, can be caused to flow through the passage so that the fluid enters the recess and cools the rod.
