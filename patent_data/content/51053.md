## Description
A DISPERSION FUEL AND A METHOD FOR ITS MANUFACTUREDescription Technical field The present invention relates to a new type of liquid fuel, comprising a. dispersion of solid particles in liquid phase, and to a method for manufacturing such a fuel. Background of the InventionBecause of the rising prices of oil, progressively increasing interest is turned towards al.ternative energy sources which can be transformed into fue l.s replaying oil..Among those fuels conceivable as alternative energy sources are the solid fuels, and not least fossil type fuels such as shistous, peat, pitch coal and.mineral coal.Even carbonaceous, renewable energy sources from plants are considered such as wood, timer offall.,.algaes and seeweed, as well as cultivated biomass as straw,.alder and sall ow..The.renewable energy sources are as.a rule more rich in water and thus more difficult to disintegrate than the fossile ones. Thus, large power thermal plants have been de vel oped, and combustion furnaces and gas purification plants have been adapted to this new fuel.The problem of replacing. oil, however, is of great significance also in conjunction with smaller plants for. energy production, where costs and environmental problems related tithe handling of shale, peat, wood, and coal when firing with solid fuel are difficult to overcome.It is therefore.necessary to be able to use solid fuel, in the same manner, as oil type liquid fuels. Many proposals have been put forward concerning so called liquid fuels, comprising a particulate.fuel in a suspension or a dispersion and these proposals can be placed in three main groups water carried systems, oil carried systems and methanol carried systems. Coal oil mixtures are those which are most obvious, and the usefulness of such mixtures will be readily realised by those skilled in this particular art, in which the oil is extended by admixing finely divided wood, peat or coal therewith. One problem with such mixtures, however, is that the solid material must be ground and substantially all water removed, and that the dry particles must then be wetted with oil and a homogenous dispersion of the coal in the oil produced.A further problem exists when using a highly pure coal raw material which cannot be purified while producing the oil suspension.Certain of these problems can be solved by using methanol instead of oil. Methanol, however, raises the price of the end product, since at least 30 by weight comprises methanol, and particularly because methanol is normally produced from coal or oil, with a thermal efficiency of about 50 .Consequently water carried liquid coal fuels have also been developed.One such fuel is based on finely ground mineral coal, water and surfactants. One advantage afforded by this system is that there is obtained when grinding and purifying the coal, by flotation, an aqueous coal product which can be utilized without it being necessary to remove all the water. One problem, however, is that of producing stable suspensions which enable the liquid fuel to be used without requiring excessive measures to prevent the phases separating during storage and transportation of the suspension using a more natural aqueous, renewable energy source the suspension in water to a liquid or pumpable fuel means an unsuitably high percentage of water present which decreases the efficiency in thermal energy transformation.Description of the present InventionIt has now been found that a particularly stable and easily combustible dispersion fuel can be produced by suspending aqueous finely divided carbon containing particles in a liquid of particular composition.This liquid may suitably be present in the state of a so called micro emulsion. Preferably, the fuel comprises more than 50 by weight solid finely ground carbon containing particles, and the liquid phase of the suspension shall comprise more than 50 by weight water, 5 30 by weight of oil and up to 5 by weight emulsifier. The content of finely ground carbon containing particles shall be as high as possible, and the lower limit of 50 by weight is not critical.These fuels can be prepared from a number of fossile and renewable energy sources by suitable development of the process, which will be more closely described in the following.An emulsion comprises two liquids which are only slightly soluble one within the other, in which one liquid is finely dispersed in the other. When the finely dispersed liquid comprises extremely small droplets in the order of 3 100 nm in the other liquid, the emulsion is normally referred to as a micro emulsion. Micro emulsions are stable at defined physical conditions and, if the liquids are transparent, are completely clear liquids, Normally micro emulsions contain surfactants tenable sufficiently small, stable liquid particles to be formed. A micro emulsion exists wi thin certain temperature ranges and is sometimes dependent on the pH of the phases.If the amount of finely divided phase is increased the emulsion will be converted, via an intermediate stage in which the two phases comprise emulsified material and emulsifying agent, to a system in which the previously finely divided phase will be the phase in which the other phase is emulsified.A micro emulsion may suitably be stabilized with fatty acid salts in combination with alcohols or amines. An optimal combination of surfactant as fatty acid salts and co acting surfactant enables stable micro emulsions having a high water content to be formed Gillberg and Fri berg ACS Symposium and Evaporation Combustion of Fuel droplets,San Francisco, August 1976 . The alcohols may be monovalent or divalent and representative examples of such alcohols are pentanol, hexanol and heptanol, and also divalent alcohols such as hexandiol. Amines and aminor alcohols can also be used. Micro emulsions are produced by, for example, dispersing oil spontaneously in water with the aid of mechanical forces and conventional surfactants. At given concentrations there are spontaneously formed clear transparent solutions with the addition of an alcohol or an amine having 5 7 carbon atoms, with emulsified droplets in the order of 8 80 nm. In technical processes no particular agitation is necessary to reach an emulsion. However, agitation to a certain extent may be necessary to bring large flows of different components together into intimate contact.It has now been found possible to produce particularly advantageous dispersion fuels in which coal has been dispersed in a micro emulsion, comprising more than 50 by weight water as the coherent phase and 5 30 by weight thick mineral oil and 5 30 by weight alcohol having one or two carbon atoms, and up to 5 by weight emulsifier.By using methanol, ethanol or other lower alkanols such as isopropanol and any butanol or mixtures thereof in conjunction with mineral oil it is possible to produce dispersion fuels in micro emulsion form, in which the oil phase comprises thick firing oil. The amount of alcohol admixed is greater the higher the viscosity of the oil. By thick firing oil is meant thick, sluggish firing oil with a viscosity from 5 cSt, preferably higher than about 10 cSt at 500C and higher, such as firing oil grade 3, 4, 5, and 6. An emulsifier is a compound of the group fatty acid soaps, carboxylic acids having 4 8 carbon atoms, carboxylic acid esters having 4 8 carbon atoms in the carboxylic acid part, alcohols having 4 8 carbon atoms, and carboxy amines having 4 8 carbon atoms. Nonionic emulsifiers can also be used, such as harmonic mixtures of hydrocarbons having a boiling point of 15O 2750C. The new dispersion fuel constitutes a high grade liquid fuel produced with a lower oil content and with a heavier firing oil than was previously possible. The novel fuel can be burned in small as well as large furnaces and plants and requires only the temperature to be maintained within the temperature range at which the micro emulsion exists. By adding alcohol the lower temperature limit at which the micro emulsion can no longer exist is decreased, which is an important advantage, and the risk of the. fuel freezing when being stored and transported reduced. A secondary effect is that the alcohol can be used as a fuel component. Finally, the presence of a lower alcohol means a drying of the solid fuel when preparing the same to.a dispersion.The novel dispersion fuel is suitably produced by integrating the manufacture of the fuel with the purifying processes normally required when mining and grinding the intended carbonaceous materials.Thereby the fuel can be prepared particularly economical and the raw material and other process resources be utilized optimally. Dispersion fuels on a micro emulsion base provides for a completely new group of fuels to be prepared, which are all pumpable and mixable with oil, carbon oil suspensions, carbon methanol suspensions and carbon water suspensions.Dispersion fuels based on different carbon containing, combustible solid raw materials and their preparation will be more closely described in the following with.reference to a number of Examples in order to clarify the general intentions set forth above and to further demonstrate the scope of the invention.Example 1An oil containing shale material from the Mahogany Zone, Colorado,USA was treated by wet grinding and enrichment of kerogene in accordance with the Swedish Patent S N 7603646 6 US B 4.176.042 . The kerogene concentrate thus obtained. by flotation and a following spherical oil agglomeration was thickened and filtered on a filter.In a following filtration system a micro emulsion consisting of 30 by weight of water, 15 by weight of heavy shale oil, obtained in the shale oil refinery, 48 by weight of a mixture of lower alkanols, and 4 by weight of an emulsifying agent consisting of nonionic hydrocarbons and fatty acid amines were added to the filter cake.The addition of replacing micro emulsion was interrupted when the kerogene micro emulsion dispersion had obtained a composition comprising 60 by weight of solid kerogene in a liquid phase and 40 by weight of a micro emulsion consisting of 55 by weight of water, 20 by weight of heavy mineral oil, 5 by weight of an emulsifier and 20 by weight of a lower alkanol, methanol .The kerogene dispersion thus obtained was intended to be fed to a plant for pyrolyzis according toSE,A,7903283 5, from which plant shale oil and shale gas are produced.Example 2Lignite from Powder River Basin, Wyoming, USA having a moisture content of 30 by weight of water was subjected to a wet grinding in a rod mill and a ball mill in a liquid consisting of a micro emulsion of water, heavy oil, a lower alkanol, ethanol , and an emulsifier. The grinding was finished when a particle size less of 100 microns had been obtained. By further addition of oil, alkanol and emulsifier in adjustable proportions the final contents of the dispersion was adjusted to 65 by weight of lignite, 22 by weight of water, 5 by weight of heavy oil, 6 by weight of ethanol, and 2 by weight of an emulsifier. All calculations made on the total weight of the dispersion . The dispersion had a viscosity of 470 cP.and was pumped to a power heat plant where it replaced commonly used heavy oil No. 6.Example 3Petrocoke obtained at the final refinery of crude oil was subjected to wet grinding in a ball mill in a micro emulsion consisting of 50 by weight of water, 12 by weight of so called slop oil, 26 by weight of a mixture of lower alkanols C1 C4 , and 4 by weight of an emulsifier until the particles of the petrocoke passed a mesh size of 90 microns. The dispersion obtained was used in a steamship engine.Example 4Crude peat was prepressed and dewatered using oil in accordance with SE,A,8101623 0. The peat oil mixture thus obtained was provided with a mixture of water, a lower alkanol, methanol and an emulsifier of supplementing composition to give a liquid phase in the form of micro emulsion consisting of 51 by weight of water, 29 by weight of heavy oil, 16 by weight of methanol, and 4 by weight of an emulsifier. The micro emulsion comprised 45 by weight of the dispersion fuel, which could be used for direct combustion in a heat plant for oil combustion or in a gasification reactor for oil.Example 5Crude peat was prepressed in an angle press to a moisture content of 70 by weight of water. The peat mass was then added to a filter press together with a micro emulsion consisting of water, oil, alkanol, and emulsifier in which press the water content of the peat was separated off and replaced by the micro emulsion. The filter cake thus obtained was provided with further micro emulsion so as to obtain a composition in accordance with that of Example 4 above. The filtrate obtained was allowed to pass a bed of peat coke on which remaining organic compounds were absorbed, whereupon the peat coke after wet grinding to a small particle size was mixed with said dispersion fuel which had been adjusted to a power heat station orig inally constructed for oil.Example 6Charcoal prepared by dry distillation of sugar cane wood on a plantage in Mindanau, Philippines, was subject to dry grinding to a small particle size in a Raymond mill. After fine sieving the coal powder obtained was dispersed in a micro emulsion consisting of 60 by weight of water, 12 by weight of heavy firing oil No. 4, 24 by weight of a mixture of lower alkanols C1 C4 comprising 75 by weight of methanol, and 4 by weight of an emulsifier i.a. consisting of an ammonia neutralized pine fatty acid. The charcoal particles were 63 by weight of the dispersion and had a particle size of less than 0.125 mm. The fuel was used to produce carbon oxide in a mobile apparatus. Example 7A mixture of wood of grown alder and grown sallow, as well as birch wood and pine forest waste was disintegrated and dried to a moisture content of 50 by weight of water. The wood mass was fed together with methanol ethanol chilled to 900C to a ball mill comprising ceramic balls. After the first milling step the mass as well as the liquid was fed to a second milling step.in which the grinding bodies consisted of coal pieces having a piece size of 20 to 70 mm. The total mass was ground to a particle size of below 0.5 mm. After heat exchange to a temperature of 50C using fresh methanol ethanol and after separation off of the main part of the methanol ethanol on a filter, the filter mass was provided with a micro emulsion consisting of water, heavy oil No. 3, lower alkanols, and an emulsifier to form a stable dispersion in a micro emulsion.The ready to use fuel contained 55 by weight of solid substance, 27 by weight of water, 6 by weight of heavy oil No. 3, 9 by weight of alkanols, and 3 by weight of an emulsifier and was used to heat tap water in a separate apparatus in a district heating plant.Example 8For the production of a dispersion fuel on basis of biomass according to Example 7 brown algae, straw were brought in, which components were fed into the second grinding step of Example 7. The feeding of algae and straw comprised 25 by weight of the wooden mass. The addition of micro emulsion was similar to the one of Example 7 but the proportions of the ingredients were varied with regard to the water contents of the algae and the straw respectively so that the composition of the liquid phase was the same as in Example 7 above. The final dispersion was used in a district heating plant for production of hot tap water. Example 9Coal from a pit was pulverized by wet grinding and the thus formed coal suspension was separated by density separation, suitably in washing cyclons in a lighter fraction, which after dewatering and optional further grinding is used for the preparation of a disper sion fuel, and a heavier fraction which is further ground and flotated.In addition to subjecting the coal to conventional wet grinding processes, the coal may also be subjected to steam splitting processes and leaching processes as a preparatory treatment prior to crushing the coal for further treatment. This method is described in SE,A, 7603646 6. When steam splitting the coal, the coal is treated with a liquid under pressure and having an elevated temperature, whereafter the pressure is rapidly equalized to atmospheric pressure, whereupon liquid which has penetrated the coal is rapidly vapourized and splits the particles at the grain boundaries. The liquid used may, for example, be water. If sulphur dioxide is available, this can be uset to advantage in liquid form or dissolved in water, and subsequent to being used may be re condensed and optionally re cycled.Subsequent to steam splitting the material, the material may be subjected to a leaching process such as to further loosen the grain boundaries and to facilitate further diminuation of the material, for example with a highly acid leaching liquid. Subsequent to subjecting the material to a flotation process or to a magnetic separation process, for removing the pyrite present, the finely divided mineral coal, which is free from sulphur, is passed to the dispersion fuel manufacturing plant.A preceding, additonal purifying process may be carried out, by dividing the material into mutually different degrees of purity, by flotation or classification screening, where in the latter case coarse material is passed to a flotation plant prior to manufacturing the dispersion fuel.For the purpose of recovering finely divided material entering cyclones and filters, the material can be returned to a coal agglomerating stage in which it is agglomerated with oil, whereafter the agglomerate is de watered and passed to a mixer in which water, methanol and emulsifier are added and a micro emulsion base is formed.This micro emulsion base is mixed with the finely divided coal phase in suitable proportions, i.e., so that the coal phase is more than 50 by weight of the dispersion fuel. In the aforegoing the coal phase has been described with reference to mineral coal, although it will be understood that other types of coal can be used, such as pitch coal, peat, asphalt and soot and coke products. Even biological products such as charcoal and biomass as well as shale material comprising kerogenes can be used as the solid fine grain fuel. The impurity content of the solid fuel, in the form of inorganic salts and the like, will naturally be present in the ultimate dispersion fuel and, as will be understood, the presence of certain impurities must be taken into account when using the fuel.The invention will now be described with reference to an example relating to the treatment of a bituminous mineral coal steam coal of conventional composition. One such steam coal has been obtained by treating so called mining coal in a washing plant and is found available as bulk goods with a particle size beneath 40 50 mm. Manufacture of the fuel, described hereinafter, may either be effected in direct connection with the primary production of steam coal, or at some location in the transport chain up to the final consumer station.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the coal required for the fuel mixture is supplied continuously to a wetgrinding plant, comprising a rod mill, in which the coal is ground down to a particle size of at most 3 5 mm. The particles in the pulverized coal smaller than about lOOvum are separated off and the pulverized coal is de watered in a centrifuge and then subjected to a density separation process in a cyclone having heavy medium, in a known manner. In this separation process, the coal is divided into a light fraction having a separation limit of 1.3 g cm3. The light fraction having a high carbon content and lower ash content is treated by itself, while the heavier fraction, in excess of 1.3 g cm3 and having a low carbon content and a higher ash content, is also treated on its own, as hereinafter described.The light fraction is of such purity that subsequent to being filtered and further ground may be charged directly to the plant for the manufacture of dispersion fuel.The heavier fraction, having the higher ash content and lower carbon content, is subjected to a further grinding process, in which it is ground to a particle size smaller than 0.1 mm in a closed circuit which incorporates a cyclone. The circuit also incorporates a classifier, from which the coal water suspension is passed to a flotation purifying stage, where ash and pyrite are separated from the suspension to obtain a purified coal, which is admixed with the finelyground coal obtained from the lighter fraction.The coal water suspension is passed to a thickener, where the major part of the water is removed from the suspension and returned to the process line.The thickened product is passed to a further de watering stage on a filter which operates under pressure and which is heated in order to remove as much water as possible. Water remaining in the filter cake is then displaced therefrom with the selected micro emulsion base in a further filtering or de watering stage, wherein water present in the pores of the filter cake is replaced with micro emulsion base.After said change of the liquid phase, the solid substance content of the coal liquid mixture and liquid contained therein are adapted by further adjustment to the composition of the mixture, with the aid of dry coal or more micro emulsion base.When displacing the water with micro emulsion base there is obtained a liquid mixture of water and emulsion base, which is passed to the fine grain slurry separated from the primary slurry, and by suitable agitation the coal content is caused to agglomerate, to form a coal agglomerate, while simultaneously separating undesirable ash material and pyrite therefrom. The coal and oil agglomerate is agitated with a liquid containing an excess of the remaining components in the micro emulsion system, for dispersion of the aggregate, whereafter the product is combined with a final micro emulsion base.The above description of the process merely sets forth the main features of a method according to the invention It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the density separation process described in the introduction can be omitted in certain cases, the coal in its entirety being ground to a size smaller than 100 am in a closed circuit which incorporates a classification apparatus. In certain cases it may be particularly suitable to incorporate a sulphur flotation stage in the grinding circuit, so that as much pyrite as possible is separated at the earliest possible point of time in the treatment process, as previously mentioned. Subsequent to completion of the grinding process, the suspension of finely ground coal and water may be passed to a hydrocyclone and de slurried.The coarser fraction, i.e. the fraction containing particles preferably greater than 20 jim, is subjected to coal flotation, thickening, filtering and displacement of the water phase with micro emulsion, as described above, while the finer fraction, comprising particles smaller than 20 um, is agglomerated with micro emulsion in an excess quantity, from displacement of the liquid phase of the coarser fraction, and micro emulsion comprising lighter oil components. The resultant fuels are particularly suited for diesel engines and more advanced combustion purposes. In addition to promoting the dispersion properties of the fuel, the surfactants can be selected so as to reduce the viscosity of the mixture, by selective adsorption on the mineral surfaces of further ionic substances, e.g., soap and fatty acids.Example 10At the preparation of a dispersion fuel based on coal in accordance with Example 9 a coal residue comprising 47mob by weight of combustible material and 53 by weight of mineral was obtained. This residue was thickened and dewatered on a filter to a moisture content of 34 by weight based on the total. In a further filtration step the water was removed using a micro emulsion consisting of water, heavy oil No. 5 also containing residues of organic solvents, and a mixture of lower alkanols, and an emulsifier. The coal residue thus treated thereby obtained a final moisture content of 32 by weight. The liquid consisted of a micro emulsion of 51 by weight of water, 16 by weight of heavy oil, 21.9 by weight of alkanols, and 4.1 by weight of an emulsifier. The filtrate was recirculated and was used for flotation purposes in the preparation of the coal men tioned in Example 9 above. The dispersion of the coal residue was pumped to a gasification reactor for the preparation of a medium calorific, about 300 B.T.U. c.ft. ,synthetized gas whereby its energy content was well utilized.Example 11In the treatment of a coal residue as described In Example 10 above an equal amount of peat transferred into a dispersion fuel in accordance with Example 5 above was added to the coal residue after thickening thereof. The additions of a micro emulsion to the water removal step and the relations therebetween were varied with regard to the new blending relationship, whereby a dispersion fuel having a composition of the liquid as in Example 10 was obtained comprising 50 by weight of coal residue and 50 by weight of peat as solid phase. As well as in Example 10 the fuel was fed by pumping to a gasification reactor for the preparation of medium synthetized gas.Example 12Bituminous mineral coal having a high gas content was flotated free from mineral ingredients and pyrite in accordance with Example 9.The purified coal was dewatered on a filter and a subsequent removal of water with a micro emulsion. Between the steps of thickening and filtration 5 kg of magnesium powder to which 2.5 kg of aluminium powder had been added, and which had been finely ground in a mixture of methanol and heavy oil No. 3, were added. The thus prepared dispersion fuel consisting of 67 by weight of coal including metal powder, 3 by weight of heavy oil No. 3, 9 by weight of a mixture of methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol in equal parts, and 4 by weight of an emulsifier as well as 17 by weight of water was stable.20 kg of ammonium nitrate were dissolved per each 100 kg of dispersion fuel and the resulting dispersion thus obtained was used as jet fuel in air craft.The described fuel mixture and its method of manufacture provide a pumpable, highly pure oil like replacement fuel for oil, said fuel mixture having properties which lie close to those of oil. The fuel mixture provides a fuel which has substantially all the good properties of a coal water mixture and which can be produced with a relatively limited amount of relatively low grade oil and preferably from the alcohols methanol or ethanol, which in turn can be produced relatively simply. The risk of the fuel freezing, which is a serious risk in other water based systems, is substantially reduced. Thus, there is produced a fuel whose manufacture is only dependent on oil to a very slight degree. The combustibility of the fuel, expressed as the cetane rating, is greater than that of other water based coal fuels. The flammability of the fuel can be further increased by adding aluminium or magnesium powder.
