# PROTECTION AGENT FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLE TUBERS

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for treating fruits and vegetable tubers in storage to protect said produce against diseases. The method uses a protection agent comprising a salt comprising an alkyl amine and a carboxylic acid. The salt will remain stable and the amine inactive at normal temperature and humidity but when the salt, conve niently applied to granules, is distributed through the stored produce heat and moisture released by the stored produce cause the salt to undergo hydrolysis, thus releasing the amine in a gaseous active form.
