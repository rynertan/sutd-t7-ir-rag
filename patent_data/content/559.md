In formula I , the alkyl group R may in particular have 1 to 5 carbon atoms, for example 1 or 2, but alkyl groups having for example 1 to 10 or 1 to 20 carbon atoms are to be understood as also included. As a preferred possibility, X5 is selected from D leucyl, D methionyl and D prolyl. As a subclass within formula I may be mentioned those peptides wherein X2 is D alanyl X is selected from L phenylalanyl and L 4 nitrophenylalanyl X5 is selected from D leucyl and D methionyl and R is methyl or ethyl, and their acid addition salts. As a further subclass within formula I may be mentioned those peptides wherein X is D alanyl, D methionyl or D methionyl sulphoxide 4 X is L phenylalanyl or L nitrophenylalanyl X5 is D leucyl, D prolyl, L prolyl, cycloleucyl,D methionyl or D methionyl sulphoxide and R is methyl, ethyl, benzyl, cyclohexyl or l hydroxyethyl, and their acid addition salts. The abbreviations used herein for amino acids and their radicals are those conventional in the art and may be found in, for example, Biochemistry, 11, 1726 1972 . In the above and throughout the following all references are to the L amino acids and their radicals except in the case of glycine and unless otherwise stated. The peptides of formula I and their acid addition salts, when assessed by a number of standard pharmacological procedures, have been found both to induce and to maintain anaesthesia in laboratory animals including rats and mice. The compounds are effective in this respect when administered by a variety of routes including parenteral, for example by intravenous or intracerebroventricular injection. Illustrative of the anaesthetic effects of the compounds are the following, which should be understood to be non limiting. i Abolition of the righting reflex. This is characteristic of recoçlised anaesthetic agents such as chloral hydrate 2,2,2 trichloro 1,l ethanol , urethan ethyl carbamate and the barbiturates derivatives of barbituric acid . An animal lacking this reflex does not roll over or attempt to regain its normal posture when placed on its back. ii Abolition of the Pinnalreflex. In this procedure a wire or similar probe is introduced into the ear pinna in the normal control animal there is a resultant reflex twitch or shake of the affected pinna. iii Abolition of the corneal reflex. In this procedure the cornea is lightly touched with a wire or similar in the normal control animal there is a resultant reflex blink of the eyelids. This reflex is of clinical importance in man in that it is one of the last reflexes to be abolished during the induction of general anaesthesia. Each of the foregoing effects i , ii and iii may be reversed by administration of the known narcotic antagonist naloxone l N allyl 7,8 dihydro 14hydroxynormorphinone . However it has been found that morphine itself does not abolish the righting reflex in laboratory animals such as mice when administered by acute bolus injection in up to lethal doses. In the acid addition salts of the peptides of formula I the activity resides in the base and the acid is of less importance although for therapeutic purposes it is preferably pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable to the recipient. Examples of such suitable acids include a mineral acids hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric and sulphuric acids b organic acids tartaric, acetic, citric, malic, lactic, fumaric9 benzoic, glycollic, gluconic, gulonic, succinic and arylsulphonic, for example P toluenesul phonic, acids. The pharmaceutically and pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salts together with those salts which are not so acceptable for example salts of hydrofluoric and perchloric acids have utility in isolation and purification of the bases, and of course the unacceptable salts are also valuable in the preparation of the acceptable salts by techniques well known in the art. The peptides of formula I and their pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be usedin the fields of both human and veterinary medicine for the induction and or main .tenance of anaesthesia in a mammal. A peptide or a salt thereof may be administered either alone as the sole anaesthetic agent or in combination with one or more other substances which may complement and or supplement its activity. Such additional substances may be administered before, simultaneously with or after administration of the peptide or salt thereof and in the case of simultaneous administration the various agents may be administered either as separate doses or as a combination formulation. As one possibility the peptide or salt thereof may be administered subsequent to administration of a beuzodiazepine tranquillizer such as chlordiazepoxide 7 chloro 2 methylamino 5 phenyl 3H 1,4 benzodiazepine 4 oxide , diazepam 7 chloro l, 3 dihydro l methyl 5 phenyl 2H l , 4 benzodiazepin 2 one and oxazepam 7 chloro1,3 dihydro 3 hydroxy 5 phenyl 2H 1,4 benzodiazepin 2 one . As another possibility the peptide or salt thereof may be administered for the maintenance of anaesthesia after this has been initially induced by the previous administration of another anaesthetic agent, for example a barbiturate such as thiopental sodium sodium 5 ethyl 5 1 methylbutyl 2 thiobarbiturate . A particular utility for the peptides of formula I and their pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, within the field of anaesthesia, is the induction and or maintenance of the state referred to as neuroleptanalgesia , a condition characterised by quiescence, psychic indifference to environmental stimuli, and analgesia see, for example,Dorland s Illustrated Medical Dictionary, twenty fifth edition, published by W.B. Sa ders, 1974, at page 1041, and The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics , Goodman,L. S. and Gilman, A. eds., fifth edition, published byMacMillan Publishing Co. Inc., 1975, especially atChapter 8, pages 97 to 101, all of which is incorporated herein by reference hereto .This condition is recognised by clinicians as desirable for enabling the performance of procedures such as bronchoscopy, X ray studies, burn dressings and cystoscopy wherein a degree of patient cooperation is of value, and a fixed dose combination comprising the narcotic analgesic fentanyl citrate N 1 phenethyl 4 piperidyl propionanilide citrate and the neuroleptic agent droperidol 1 l 3 p fluorobenzoyl propyl 1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 4 pyridyl 2 benzimidazolinone has found acceptance for use in such circumstances. Heretofore neuroleptanalgesia has been achievable only upon administration of such a narcotic analgesic bolus neuroleptic drug combination as that above mentioned.The peptides of formula T and their acceptable acid edition salts are thus an important clinical advance and araluable addition to the armamentarium of the medical and veterinary professions in alone enabling this result, without any additional medication being required. In addition to their ability both to induce and maintain anaesthesia, as hereinbefore described, the peptides of formula I and their acid addition salts have been found to exhibit morphine agonist activity.As generally accepted and as the term is used herein, a morphine agonist is a compound the biological activity of which mimics that of the natural alkaloid. The pharmacological properties and therapeutic uses of morphine are well documented in the literature, see for example The Pharmacological Basis of Thera peutics , Goodman, L.S. and Gilman, A.eds., published by The MacMillan Company, New York, third edition 1965 especially at Chapter 15, pages 247 to 266, and Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia , Blacow, N.W.ed., published by The Pharmaceutical Press, London, twenty sixth edition 1972 especially at pages 1100 to 1106, all of which is incorporated herein by reference hereto. As is well known however Goodman, L.S. et al., loc. dit, Chapter 16 repeated administration of morphine can lead to the recipient developing an addiction to the drug and tolerance to its effects and to his manifesting withdrawal symptons when administration is discontinued. For many years therefore research has been conducted with the aim of obtaining a compound having the activity spectrum of morphine whiie lackIng its disadvantages. The morphine agonist properties of the peptides c formula I and their derivates as hereinbefore defined include the following which are given solely by way of illustration and should be understood to be non limiting. A In vitro i Inhibition of neurally evoked contractions of the isolated mouse va deferens when tested by the method of Hughes et al Brain Research, 88 1975 using pulses at 0.1 H , , the inhibition being etablished by the known narcotic antagonist naloxone 1 N allyl 7,8 dihydro 14 hydroxy normorphinone . ii Reduction of electrically induced Contractions of the isolated guinea pig ileum when prepared for stimulation after the manner of Paton . J. Pharmacol. 12 1957 119 127 . Each intestinal segment was impaled by the anode and suspended with a 2 3g load. Stimulus paremeters frequency 0.1Hz duration 0.4ms voltage supramaximal 30 40V the contractions were transduced isotonically . B In vivo i The compounds exhibit analgesic activity, for example they are effective in mice in the hot plate procedure standard in the art when tested by a modification of the method of Eddy, N.B. et al. J. Pharm.Exp. Therap. 107, 385 1953 , the compounds being administered by intracerebroventricular injection, and this activity is abolished by naloxone. As a further illustration of analgesic activity the peptides of formula I are effective in mice in the abolition of acetic acid induced writhing when screened by a modification of the method of Hendershot L.C. andForsaith J., J. of Pharm. and Exp. Ther. 1959, Vol. 125, pg. 237 the compounds being administered orally and the abolition being reversed by naloxone. ii The compounds exhibit antitussive activity, for example when tested in guinea pigs according to the method of Boura et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol, 39, 1970 225. iii The compounds exhibit antidiarrhoeal activity, for example they are effective in reducing castor oil induced diarrhoea in rats. Because of their morphine agonist activity already alluded to the peptides of formula I together with their pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be used in the treatment of mammals in the fields of both human and veterinary medicine in any condition where an agent with a morphine like effect is indicated. Specific utilities that may be mentioned, by way of example, include the following 1 The relief of pain analgesia , for example pain arising from spasm of smooth muscle as in renal or biliary colic, pain due to terminal illness such as cancer, pain in the post operative period, and obstetrical pain. 2 Sedation, for example in pre anaesthetic medication tranquillization the induction of sleep, especially where sleeplessness is due to pain or cough and the relief of anxiety in general. 3 The suppression of cough. 4 The relief of dyspnoea, for example that of acute left ventricular failure or pulmonary oedema. 5 The induction of constipation, for example after ileostomy or colostomy, and the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery. 6 The induction of euphoria and the treatment of depression, for example when allied to the relief of pain in terminal illness such as cancer. For each of the utilities recited hereinbefore for the peptides of formula I and their acid addition salts, that is to say, whether for use for the induction and or maintenance of anaesthesia for example the induction and or maintenance of neuroleptanalgesia or for use in a condition where an agent with a morphinelike effect is indicated for example the utilities specifically identified hereinbefore under 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 the amount required of the peptide or acid addition salt thereof hereafter referred to as the active ingredient will vary with the route of administration and with the nature and required extent of the desired effect, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician or veterinarian.In general however for each of these utilities the dosage will be in the range 0.0025yg to 40mg per kilogram bodyweight of mammal, preferably o.Olpg to 4.Omg kg and optimally 0.25 to 400rg kg all dosages calculated with reference to the peptide base . The active ingredients may be administered by any route appropriate to the effect to be achieved, suitable routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical buccal , vaginal and parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous . It will be appreciated that the preferred route will vary with the effect to be achieved and titus for example in the relief of obstetrical pain administration directly into the spinal cord may be advantageous. While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered as the raw chemical it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical formulation preparation. The formulations, both veterinary and for human use, of the present invention comprise an active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier s must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Desirably the formulations should not include oxidising agents and other substances with which peptides are known to be incompatible. The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical buccal , vaginal or parenteral including subcutanecs, intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend upon for example the active ingredient and the condition to be treated The formulations snay conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients.In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid or as an oil in water liquid emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as. a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Orally ingestible formulations comprising the compounds of formula I may be rendered less liable to any abuse, for example, unauthorised intravenous administration, by including in the formulation an appropriate amount of a specific opiate antagonist such as naloxone 1 N allyl 7, 8 dihydro l4 hydroxy normorphinone which is ineffective in man upon oral administration but which is effective upon administration by the intravenous route. The medicinal effect of the compounds of formula I would thus be unaffected when such a formulation was taken orally as intended but would be antagonized and countered by the naloxone if intravenous administration were effected. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter, while a suitable formulation for nasal administration is nasal drops comprising the active ingredient in aqueous or oily solution. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, creams, pastes or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient, which solutions are preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Such formulations may be conveniently prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering said solution sterile and isotonic with the blood of the recipient. The formulations may be presented in unit or in multi dose containers, for example sealed ampoules or vials. Formulations suitable for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid inculde a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. It should be understood that in addition to the aforementioned ingredients the formulations of this invention may include one or more additional ingredients such as diluents, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickners, lubricants, preservatives including anti oxidants and the like. Where the formulation for human cr for veteri nary use, is presented in edit dosage form, for example those unit dosage forms specifically mentioned above, each unit thereof conveniently contains the active ingredient as above defined in an amount in the range 0.125 g. to 2g., preferably 1C27tg. to 200 mg.and optimally 12.5 g. to 20 mg. all weights calculated with reference to the peptide base . The peptides of formula I and their acid addition salts may be prepared by any of the methods known in the art for the peparation of compounds of analogous structure. Thus they may be formed by the sequential coupling of ayprepriate amino acids using either classical methods u peptide synthesis or solid phase procedures, or by the initial preparation and subsequent coupling of peptide subunits. Such reaction may be effected by, for example, activating the carboxylic acid group of the ingoing amino acid and protecting the non reacting amino and carboxylic acid groups. Such h techniques are standard in the peptide art. Details of suitable activating and protecting masking groups and of suitable reaction conditions both for the coupling reactions and for the removal of protecting groups giving the minimun of racemisation may be found in the following literature, all of which is incorporated herein by reference hereto, which is given purely by way of exemplification and which is intended to be neither exhaustuve nor limiting. Schröder and Lüebke, The PePtides AcademicPress 1965 . Bellean and Malek, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 90, 165 1968 . Tilak, Tetrahedron Letters, 849 1970 . Beyerman, Helv. Chim. Acta., 56, 1729 1973 . Stewart and Young, Solid Phase PeptideSynthesis W.H. Freeman and Co. 1969 . Depending upon the reaction conditions the peptides of formula I are obtained in the form of the free base or as an acid addition salt thereof. The acid addition salts may be converted into the free bases or salts of other acids, and the bases may be converted into acid addition salts thereof, by techniques well known in the art. The peptides of formula I and acid addition salts thereof may thus be prepared by condensing a reagent II H Y1 OH II wherein Y is selected from the radical Tyr and a partial radical sequence having the radical Tyr at its N terminal end and from thereon corresponding to formula I , with a reagent III H y2 III wherein y2 corresponds to the balance of the above defined product, the reagents II and III being optionally protected and or activated where and as appropriate followed if necessary and as appropriate by one or both of the steps of deprotection of the product and conversion of the product into the base or an acid addition salt thereof. It will be appreciated that the peptides of formula I may also be prepared by reaction of a corresponding peptide alkyl ester, for example the methyl ester, with an appropriate monoalkylamine. It will be appreciated from the foregoing that what we will claim may comprise any novel feature described herein, principally and not exclusively, for example a The peptides of formula I as hereinabove defined and acid addition salts thereof. b Methods as described hereinabove for the preparation of the peptides of formula I and acid addition salts thereof. c Pharmaceutical formulations comprising a peptide of formula I or a pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof together with an acceptable carrier therefor. d Methods for the preparation of the pharmaceutical formulations defined in c above. e A method for the treatment of a mammal for a condition wherein an agent with a morphine like effect is indicated, comprising the administration to the mammal of a treatment effective non toxic amount of a peptide of formula I or a pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. f A method according to e above for the treatment of a condition selected from those specifically identified hereinabove under 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 . g A method for the induction and or maintenance of anaesthesia in a mammal, comprising the administration to the mammal of an anaesthetic effective, non toxic amount of a peptide of formula I or a pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. h A method for the induction and or maintenance of neuroleptanalgesia in a mammal, comprising the administration to the mammal of a neuroleptanalgesic effective, non toxic amount of a peptide of formula I or a pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.

A Analgesia in mice in the hot plate test modification of the method of Eddy, N.B. et al.,J. Pharm. Exp. Therap. 1953 107, 385, the peptide being administered by intracerebroventricular injection . B Antidiarrhoeal activity in the rat. In this procedure rats were starved for 24 hours, the peptide then administered either subcutaneously or orally followed after 15 minutes by 1 ml castor oil per rat given orally. C For antitussive testing, guinea pigs are subjected to an aerosol containing 20,ó citric acid, 30 minutes after administration of compound orally or subcutaneously . The number of coughs during a five minute exposure are counted and meaned for six animals per treatment. The method is that described by Boura, A.L.A., Green, A.F. and Saunders, I.A. Br. J. Pharmac.,May 1970, Vo1. 39, No. 1, page 225. D Analgesia in mice in the writhing test modification of the method of Hendershot L.C. and Forsaith J. J. of Pharm. and Exp. Ewer. 1959, Vol. 125, pg. 237 the peptide being administered orally. E Compounds are tested for anaesthetic effects following intracerebroventricular injection in mice.The animals are observed for loss of righting reflex failure to roll over within 10 seconds of being turned on their backs , loss of pinnal reflex failure to flick the ear in response to a light touch. at the base of the pinna and loss of cornea reflex failure to blink when the cornea is touched lightly . Loss of all three reflexes constitutes anaesthesia. In addition, any other effects are noted. If a compound shows a degree of anaesthesia at the starting dose of 10 g mouse, further doses are done and an ED5O calculated. Interesting compounds are then tested intravenously in the same manner. From the data obtained the respective E G,O figures were calculated i.e. the dose required te elicit the appropriate effect in 50 of the animals .N.T. not tested.
