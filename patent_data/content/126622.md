# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO HOLOGRAPHY

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for the production of holograms. The invention resides in the multiplexing of a sequence of interference patterns formed by using a display device 16 , controlled by data representative of a plurality of two dimen sional representations of information, to modulate radiation with regulation of the relative spacing between representa tions 16 and the holographic recording medium 18 . Description is given of extensions of the invention so as to provide for grey scaling, colouring and half toning of the hologram 18 .
