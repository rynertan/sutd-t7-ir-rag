# MULTIPLE USE MOLTEN METAL FILTERS MULTIPLE USE MOLTEN METAL FILTERS

## Abstract
A reusable filter medium, substantially all of a porous ceramic portion of which can filter molten metal which is flowed therethrough, comprising a sealing plate 11 of heat resistant material and hollow cylindrical elements 21,23 of porous ceramic material mounted on and supported by the sealing plate, the cross sectional thickness of the wall of each cylindrical element being generally equivalent to that of the sealing plate. Ports 13 associated with the sealing plate function to provide extensions of the interior of each hollow cylindrical element through the sealing plate. The sealing plate is suspended in the flow path of molten metal such that molten metal flows from the exterior surfaces of each cylindrical element and the surface of the sealing plate which is adjacent to each of the exterior surfaces of the cylindrical elements and through the cross sectional thicknesses of the sealing plate and the cylindrical elements.
