# REMOVAL OF SODIUM IONS FROM ALKALINE AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS BY MEANS OF AN ELECTROLYTIC MEMBRANE PROCESS

## Abstract
A method of removing sodium ions from an alkaline aqeuous solution such as a leach solution which contains dissolved sodium tungstate. The method involves passing the solutions through the anode compartment of an electro lytic cell and passing an electrical direct current through the cell causing the sodium ions to pass through the cation selective membrane and tungstic acid to be produced in the anode compartment. Sodium containing alkali is bled from the cathode compartment at a rate sufficient to prevent build up of alkali in the cathode compartment. The tungstic acid is typically converted to ammonium tungstate by treatment with ammonia and then the ammonium tungstate further treated for recovery of the tungsten values.
