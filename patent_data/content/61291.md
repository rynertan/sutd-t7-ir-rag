# Wingsail arrangement.

## Abstract
A wingsail has two rigid symmetrical aerofoil section sail sections 10, 12 which are mounted one downstream of the other, the trailing sail section 12 being freely pivotally mounted to the centre line of the leading sail section 10 so that its leading edge just clears the trailing edge of leading sail section. A hinged symmetrical rigid flap 14 extends downstream from the trailing edge of the leading sail section 10 , the flap being adapted to be moved to one side or the other in response to a swinging movement of the trailing sail section 12 relative to the leading sail section 10 so that the leeward surface of the flap 14 can form a more or less smooth extension of the leeward surface of the leading sail section 10 , the spacing between the flap 14 and the trailing sail section 12 forming a convergent linear nozzle so as to assist in directing air over the leeward surface of the trailing sail section 12 and energise the local flow, prolong the extent of attachment of flow and enable the optimum thrust coefficient to be reached.
