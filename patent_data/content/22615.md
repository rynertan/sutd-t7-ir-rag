# Heat sealing apparatus for a strapping machine, heat control means and filter apparatus for use in such a machine.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a strapping machine for applying a plastic strap around an object, tensioning the strap and heat sealing together overlapping portions of the strap, including a retractable heating member movable between the overlapping strap portions and a pressure applying means including a pressure block with a tiltable universal joint coupling for pressing the overlapping strap portions against the heating element with a first relatively light pressure to melt the facing surfaces thereof. The heating element is withdrawn while the pressure applying means presses the strap thereagainst with the first pressure, and then the melted strap portions are pressed together with a strong second pressure to complete the seal. A cam with a yieldable section controls the first pressure and a compression spring controls the second pressure. While retracted, the heating element is raised to a higher temperature for burn off of strap residues. Switch means disposed in the strap path provide a positive stop to prevent strap overfeed while a yieldable track section permits escape of excess strap from the path to prevent jamming. Air filter means remove waste products of the heat sealing operation.
