# Pump.

## Abstract
A fluid pump having an outer cylindrical housing 10 rotating relative to an inner hub 44 from which radially projects a probe 52 apertured in its external surface to be exposed to the flow therepast of an annulus of operational liquid 14 constrained in a circular path of motion by the rotating housing, the probe having an internal passage for communicating the aperture with a first external space and the inner liquid free space in the housing having an outlet for communicating with a second external space. In use, fluid to be pumped is sucked out of the apertured probe to emerge as apertured probe to emerge as fluid bubbles which migrate through the rotating liquid annulus to the liquid free centre, thence to pass to the outlet.
