## Description
This invention relates to electric moisture meters for measuring the water content of grain, and particularly to an electric moisture meter capable of correcting measured water content for the error due to the change of weight of each grain sample from a standard weight. An electric moisture meter is disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 4,408,128 which was issued on Oct. 4, 1983 to Fujita and assigned to the same assignee as in this invention. An electric moisture meter measures an electric capacitance of an object being measured by holding it between the plus and minus electrodes, and indicates a value of the water content on the basis of the previously examined correlation between the water content and the electric characteristic. A sample of an object to be measured, or for example, grain is placed in a cup of a constant volume and then poured into a moisture meter grain container with two electrode plates provided as side walls. The change of electric capacitance is measured between the electrodes and converted to the water content of the grain. This capacitance change depends on the weight and water content of the grain sample. However, the weight of grain filled in a constant volume cup is not definite for every samples, or depends on the shape and size of a grain each of which varies for different kind of grain, and on the degree of packing the grain, or volume density. If a constant weight of grain is sampled and placed in the moisture meter container for the measurement of water content, the moisture meter needs a balance and thus it takes much time to measure as compared with the measurement for a constant volume of grain placed in a cup. If a measurement system is employed in which the sample container suspended by a spring actuates a micro switch when it reaches a constant weight as disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 3,794,911, it is necessary to delay the actuation of the switch so that the switch is not actuated by the inertia of the grain of short weight due to the pouring force of the sample grain. The short weight will result in a low value of water content being indicated. US A 3794911 discloses the features a and b of claim 1. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an electric moisture meter which measures the water content of the sample on the basis of the electric capacitance of the sample placed between a pair of electrodes and is capable of correcting measured rate of water content for the error due to the variation of weight of each sample from a standard weight. According to this invention, there is provided an electric moisture meter capable of correcting the measured water content value of each sample which is indicated on the base of the electric capacitance of the sample placed in an electric field, or between a pair of electrodes, for the error due to the change of weight of each sample from a standard weight by an electric signal produced in proportion to the weight of the sample, thereby reducing the scattering of density of each sample. The present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows the relation between the weight of a sample of grain and the electrical capacitance between the electrodes of an electric moisture meter. From Fig. 1, it will be seen that grain of more water content as indicated by a curve 21 has larger capacitance than the others indicated by curves 22 and 23. The capacitance C₀ at zero weight as shown in Fig. 1 depends on the electrode structure of the moisture meter. When grain of a constant volume is repetitively sampled, the weight of the samples scatters over a weight range 24 around a standard weight W In Fig. 2, the abscissa shows the standard moisture content specified by the standard measurement in the regulation under the Japanese examination law for agricultural products, or the rate of weight reduced after grain wheat is left for 5 hours in the evironment of 105 C and one atmosphere, and the ordinate shows the output, or the rate of water content from a conventional moisture meter. A curve 31 is an imaginary curve determined by the minimum square method on the basis of the measured data which are much deviated from the curve 31 as indicated by small crosses. Fig. 3 shows an embodiment of a high frequency electric moisture meter of the invention. A grain sample 4 in a constant volume cup is poured into a sample container of the moisture meter, or placed in the space surrounded by an insulating bottom plate 1 made of for example, plastic, an inner electrode 2 and an outer electrode 3. The electrodes 2 and 3 are connected through wires 5 and 6 to a capacitance measuring circuit 11. The electric capacitance is converted to a voltage corresponding to the moisture content by the capacitance measuring circuit 11, and then converted to a digital signal by an analog to digital converter 12. The digital signal is supplied to a microcomputer 16. The total weight of the sample container, or of the electrodes 2, 3, plate 1 and insulating case 9 is converted by a load to capacitance converter 13 to an electric capacitance, which is then supplied through wires 7, 8 to an oscillator 14. The load to capacitance converter 13 is constructed as shown in Fig. 5. That is, this converter 13 is formed of a spring balance comprising a fixed portion 53, springs 54 and 55 suspended from the fixed portion 53, and an upper electrode 51, the springs 54 and 55 being loaded with the gravitational force of the upper electrode 51 and the sample container 2, 3, 1, 9 shown in Fig. 3. The reciprocal distance between the upper electrode 51 and a lower electrode 52 is thus changed in proportion to the weight of the grain in the sample container. In other words, the weight of the grain is converted to the electric capacitance between the electrodes 51 and 52. The oscillator 14 can be formed of a known LC oscillator or RC oscillator. Figs. 7a and 7b are detailed circuit diagrams of the oscillator 14. In Fig. 7a, a capacitance C₄ is the electric capacitance to which the weight of the grain is to be converted. This oscillator is formed of the capacitance C₄, a capacitor C₅, four resistors and two PNP transistors T₁ and T₂ and oscillates at a frequency proportional to the weight. In this case, NPN transistors may be used instead of the PNP transistors, to form a similar circuit. A capacitance C₇ in Fig. 7b is the capacitance to which the weight is to be converted. This oscillation circuit is formed of the capacitance C₇, a coil L, a capacitance C₆ and an NPN transistor T₃ and oscillates at a frequency proportional to the weight. The oscillator 14 is connected to a frequency counter 15. Thus, the weight signal of a digital form produced from the frequency counter 15 is supplied to the microcomputer 16, where the measured electrical capacitance, C The microcomputer 16 calculates the rate of water content from an equation derived from the following procedure Since the electric characteristics of different kinds of grain are different even if they have the same water content, a switch for selecting a kind of grain is added to the moisture meter, thereby making it more useful. The moisture meter of this invention has a grain selecting switch 19 provided as shown in Fig. 6 which shows part of Fig. 3 . The microcomputer 16 calculates the water content M from the electric capacitance by using a coefficient corresponding to the electric signal indicative of a selected kind of grain supplied from the switch 19. The same wheat sample as used in the measurement shown in Fig. 2 was measured by the moisture meter shown in Fig. 3 and the measured water content was corrected for the error due to the change of weight from the standard weight by using equation 2 . The results are shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4, it will be seen that the measured data coincide with a curve 41 obtained in the same way as for the curve 31. The rate of water content calculated by the microcomputer 16 is converted by a decoder driver 17 to a data format suitable for being displayed, which is then displayed on a display 18.
