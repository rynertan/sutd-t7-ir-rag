## Description
The present invention relates to a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons. U.S. Patent No. 4,350,835 describes a process for converting ethane to liquid aromatics by contacting the ethane with a zeolite catalyst such as ZSM 5 having incorporated therein a minor amount of gallium. U.S. Patent No. 4,175,057 describes a process for producing aromatics by contacting a C₃ C₈ hydrocarbon with a gallium catalyst supported on an aluminosilicate in which the ratio of silica to alumina is between 20 1 and 70 1. U.S. Patent No. 4,157,356 describes a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons by contacting a C₃ C₈ hydrocarbon with a gallium catalyst on a silica support which has a surface area greater than 500 m² g and a pore volume less than 0.8 ml g. An object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons with an improved yield of benzene. Accordingly the invention resides in a process for producing aromatic hydrocarbons, comprising contacting a feedstock comprising one or more C₂ C₈ non aromatic hydrocarbons with a catalyst comprising a crystalline zeolite material having a constraint index within the range 3 to 12, said contacting taking place under sufficient aromatization conditions and in the presence of hydrogen sulfide. Zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still smaller channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as molecular sieves and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline aluminosilicates. These aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three dimensional framework of SiO₄ and AlO₄ in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Ca 2, Sr 2, Na, K or Li, is equal to unity. One type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially with another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner. By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation. The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. Although zeolites may contain silica and alumina, it is recognized that the silica and alumina portions may be replaced in whole or in part with other oxides. More particularly, GeO₂ is an art recognized substitute for SiO₂ and B₂O₃, Cr₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, and Ga₂O₃ are art recognized replacements for Al₂O₃. Accordingly, the term zeolite is used herein to connote not only materials containing silicon and aluminum atoms in the crystalline lattice structure thereof, but also materials which contain suitable replacement atoms for such silicon and or aluminum. An important characteristic of the crystal structure of the of zeolites suitable for use in accordance with the present invention is that they provide a selective constrained access to and egress from the intracrystalline free space by virtue of having an effective pore size intermediate between the small pore Linde A and the large pore Linde X, i.e. the pore windows of the structure are of about a size such as would be provided by 10 membered rings of silicon atoms interconnected by oxygen atoms. Rather than attempt to judge from crystal structure whether or not a zeolite possesses the necessary constrained access to molecules of larger cross section than normal paraffins, a simple determination of the Constraint Index as may be made as described in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 4,016,218. Zeolites suitable for the present invention are those having a Constraint Index of about 3 to 12. Constraint Index CI values for some typical materials are Preferred zeolites include ZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 48, of which ZSM 5 and ZSM 11 are particularly preferred. ZSM 5 is described in greater detail in U.S. Patents No. 3, 702,886 and Re. 29,948. ZSM 11 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979. ZSM 23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842. ZSM 35 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245. ZSM 48 is more particularly described in U.S. Patent No. 4,375,573. It is to be understood that by referring to foregoing patent documents to describe the preferred zeolites for use in the present process, it is intended that identification of the zeolites be resolved on the basis of the respective X ray diffraction patterns disclosed in the patents since it is the crystal structure, as identified by the X ray diffraction fingerprint , which establishes the identity of any given crystalline zeolite material. Preferably, the zeolites used in the present process have a silica alumina mole ratio of at least 12. The specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are substantially catalytically inactive, possibly because the intra crystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 540 C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 540 C in air for 15 minutes to 24 hours. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of this special class of zeolite. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to zeolite structures of the class herein identified by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, alone or in combinations. Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the above zeolites may be converted to the hydrogen form, generally by intermediate formation of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium ion exchange and calcination of the ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form. In addition to the hydrogen form, other forms of the zeolite can be employed. Such other forms of the zeolite are those wherein the original alkali metal content has been reduced to less than about 50 percent by weight of the original alkali metal contained in the zeolite as synthesized, usually 0.5 percent by weight or less. Thus, the original alkali metal of the zeolite may be replaced by ion exchange with other suitable metal cations including, by way of example, nickel, copper, zinc, palladium, calcium or rare earth metals. In practicing the conversion process of the present invention, it may be useful to incorporate the above described crystalline zeolites with a matrix comprising another material resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in such processes. Such matrix materials include synthetic or naturally occurring substances as well as inorganic materials such as clay, silica and or metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constitutent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolites employed herein may be composited with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica beryllia, and silica titania, as well as ternary compositions, such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of zeolite component and inorganic oxide gel matrix, on an anhydrous basis, may vary widely with the zeolite content ranging from between 1 to 99 percent by weight and more usually in the range of 5 to 80 percent by weight of the dry composite. The aromatization conditions suitable for use in the present method include a temperature of 100 C to 700 C, a pressure of 10 to 6080 kPa 0.1 to 60 atmospheres , a weight hourly space velocity WHSV of 0.1 to 400 and a hydrogen hydrocarbon mole ratio of 0 to 20. The feedstock to be aromatized may comprise ethylene, propylene and or propane, e.g., from 1 to 30 weight percent of ethylene, from 1 to 30 weight percent of propylene and from 1 to 30 weight percent of propane. This feedstock may be, e.g., a refinery off gas. The feedstock also comprises from 2 to 50, preferably 10 to 30 volume percent of hydrogen sulfide i.e. H₂S . 5.0g of the hydrogen form of ZSM 5 was heated at 600 C and propylene was passed over the catalyst at 40cc min. Example 1 . In Example 1 propylene was passed under the same conditions except that an H₂S co feed was added at 4cc min. or 10 by volume of propylene . Runs were repeated with H₂S co feed increased by 10 . The results are shown in Table 1. The yield of BTX i.e. benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene was 50 2 in all runs. In the presence of H₂S the benzene yield increased from 23.8 to the maximum of 39.5 , an increase of 66 over the run in the absence of H₂S. This Example demonstrates that the process of the present invention is also applicable for diluted propylene or a mixture of hydrocarbons such as a refinery of gas containing, by wt, 2 H₂, 37.6 CH₄, 22.6 C₂H₆, 15.1 C₂H₄ and 6.7 C₃H₆. Runs were made as in Examples 1 6 except propylene feed was replaced with the mixed gas. In the absence of H₂S, benzene yield was 12.6 . The yield increased to 13.6 with 10 H₂S and 14.3 with 20 H₂S co feed at 600 C. The foregoing Examples point out that higher benzene yields are obtained at the expense of toluene and C8 aromatics production.
