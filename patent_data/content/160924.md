# Wall sleeves.

## Abstract
A one piece, unitary, molded resin wall sleeve precursor member has cup shaped end sections of external diameter D each having a radial flange, with each flange connecting to a hollow transition section that in turn connects to one end of a series of N coaxial sleeve sections of internal diameter D, the sleeve sections being interconnected by N 1 hollow water stop sections having diameters much larger than D. A wail sleeve assembly is derived from this precursor member by cutting off the end sections at their flanges and cutting off the transition sections to leave a wall sleeve, including the water stop and sleeve sections, having a total length L approx imately equal to the width W of a concrete wall. The cup like end sections are inserted into the ends of the wall sleeve, and their flanges afford a convenient means to anchor the resulting assembly to a concrete form.
