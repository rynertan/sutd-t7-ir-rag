# Reducing the effects of radial voids in electrical connections.

## Abstract
A radial void present at the juncture of interengaged electrical connector elements in an electrical connection 10 is reduced in size and relocated to a position of lesser electrical stress by a flexible annular lip 78 integral with one of the connector elements and urged, in response to completion of the connection, into the void.
