# Capacitive non contact gauging system.

## Abstract
A capacitive non contact gauging system comprises a plurality of head assemblies 16 each having a plurality of probes 60 , a plurality of known capacitors 64 connected one to each probe 60 and a plurality of amplifier output circuits 66 connected one to each probe 60 . An oscillator 52 feeds an oscillatory signal to each probe 60 and capacitor 64 combination to develop at the probe 60 a signal dependent upon the relative magnitudes of the probe to workpiece capacitance and the known capacitance 64 . A first order multiplexer 18 associated with each head assembly 16 samples the output signals of the amplifier output circuits 66 associated with the respective probes 60 in that head assembly 16 , and a second order multiplexer 20 samples the first order multiplexers 18 . A plurality of PROM s 22 each associated with a respective one of the head assemblies 16 and storing information pertaining to the transfer characteristics of the amplifier output circuits 66 associated with that one of the head assemblies 16 are also arranged to be sampled by a multiplexer 24 coterminously with the sampling of the output signals of the amplifier output circuits 66 . A processing unit 12 receives the sampled output signals and the correspondingly sampled transfer characteristic information and derives therefrom an evaluation of the respective probe to workpiece distance. The processing unit 12 further includes arrangements for i autocalibration of the processing unit, and ii for autocalibration of the oscillator output signal.
