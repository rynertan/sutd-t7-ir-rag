# COATED STEEL PLATE FOR HIGHLY CORROSION RESISTANT FUEL CONTAINER AND PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION.

## Abstract
Coated steel plate suitable for forming a fuel container, which comprises a base steel plate optionally having provided thereon an undercoat layer composed of at least one of Ni, Co, and Cu having formed thereon in sequence a first coating layer mainly comprising a Pb Sn alloy, a second coating layer containing a Pb and P containing compound, and a third coating layer containing at least one of Sn, Ni, and Co with the surface of the third coating layer being optionally modified with a liquid containing phosphate or chromium ion. This plate has excellent corrosion resistance, formability, solderability and weldability.
