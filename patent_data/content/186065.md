# Process for preparing a resister element.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to a thick film resistor composi tion for firing in a low oxygen containing atmosphere comprising finely divided particles of a semiconductive material consisting essentially of a cationic excess solid solution and b a nonreducing glass having a softening point below that of the semiconductive material dispersed in c organic medium and to resistor elements made there from.
