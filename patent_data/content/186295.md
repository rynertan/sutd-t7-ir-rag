# Local oscillator and mixer assembly.

## Abstract
A radio frequency mixer and a local oscillator integrated into a single housing, and including a Gunn type oscillator 22 coupled to the mixer by a section 14 of microstrip transmission line and a section of suspended stripline 12 . A broadside coupler in the suspended stripline provides dc and intermediate frequency isolation for the mixer, and a block of dielectric material on the microstrip provides improved temperature compensation for the diode oscillator. The entire compact assembly has good conversion loss perform ance over a relatively wide frequency band, and is relatively insensitive to temperature changes.
