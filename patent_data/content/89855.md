# Cold recapping method for tires utilizing uncured rubber and compressible mold.

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for cold retreading or recap ping of the running surface of a vehicle tire. A rubber, rope and cloth mold larger in diameter than the recap tires produced in it is produced utilizing a new tire male mold 22 covered with perforated polypropylene film 19 , uncured rubber 12A with nylon rope 23 at its edges and highly stretchable cloth 16 enclosed in an envelope 24 and cured by application of pressure and heat. A larger male mold is used to make the final female mold directly, or a like size male mold is used to make an intermediate mold which is used to produce a tread ring 34B that is stretched to form a larger diameter male mold from which a final mold 46 is prepared. The somewhat flexible, compressibie final female mold 46 thus produced is then utilized in recapping tires by positioning it around a prepared tire carcass 48 coated with cement 52 , a layer of uncured rubber 50A , and a sheet of perforated polypropylene film 54 . The mold and tire assembly is then enclosed in an envelope 24 and placed in a chamber where curing of the rubber layer is accomplished by inflation of the tire carcass, evacuation of the envelope, pressurization of the chamber and application of heat.
