# FLUFFING AND CARDING DEVICE FOR SHOE SOLES

## Abstract
A fluffing and carding device for shoe soles comprises a supporting block 1 having incorporated therein a plurality of pneumatically or hydraulically controlled plungers 3 , whose rods 4 project from the block 1 . The sole 22 is pressed by the plungers 3 against a rigid pressing plane 18 . A fluffing and carding unit 20 is disposed at an opening 19 of the pressing plane 18 . The supporting block 1 is carried by a carriage 16 adapted to move parallel to the pressing plane 18 so that the whole surface of the sole 22 to be worked comes in contact with the fluffing and carding unit 20 .
