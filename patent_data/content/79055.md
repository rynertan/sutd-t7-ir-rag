# Titanium clad copper electrode and method for making.

## Abstract
A titanium clad electrode and a method for making, the electrode having a conductive, substantially pure metal substrate, a substantially pure valve metal coating substrate, a substantially pure valve metal coating and at least one zone of interdiffusion between the substantially pure metals. The coating is applied using fused salt electrolyte electrodeposi tion techniques.
