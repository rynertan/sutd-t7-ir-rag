# A method of and an apparatus for performing operations in relation to a container sleeve.

## Abstract
A rotary packaging machine advances carton sleeves 2 stepwise through a series of stations at which various opera tions are performed in relation to the sleeves. At certain earlier ones of the stations operations are performed upon the bot toms of the sleeves at a desired common level. At certain later ones of the stations operations are performed upon the tops of the sleeves at a higher desired common level. At one station intermediate the earlier ones and later ones, the sleeves are lowered by an amount dependent upon their heights, so as to bring their tops to that higher desired com mon level.
