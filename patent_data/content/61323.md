# Process for producing carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide so produced.

## Abstract
Fuel is passed via line 13 to a fluidized bed 21 containing reactive CaO and CaSO₄ at a fuel oxidation temperature e.g. 730 C below the temperature at which CaO reacts with CO₂ to form CaCO₃. The bed is fluidized by an inerts free gas containing hydrogen and or a source thereof, e.g. steam and fuel is therein partially oxidized, CaSO₄ being reduced to CaS. CO₂ thus formed is fixed as CaCO₃, and bed solids containing CaS and CaCO₃ pass via 33 to a fluidized decarbonation bed 31 operated at a temperature e.g. 850 C above the decarbonation tempera ture of CaCO₃ whereby CO₂ is liberated and is recovered after passage through a heat recovery device 6 . The decarbona tion bed 31 is preferably fluidized by the gas products from the fuel oxidation bed which reduce CaSO₄ therein to CaS and form additional CO₂. Bed solids containing CaS and CaO pass line 37 to an oxidation bed 36 fluidized with air to convert CaS to CaSO₄ with much heat liberation. Hot bed solids are returned to the decarbonation and fuel conversion beds to furnish heat and CaSO₄ to maintain the reactions therein.
