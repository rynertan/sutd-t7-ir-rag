# Air drying compositions for treating fibrous substrates.

## Abstract
Polymer compositions are described that confer an enhanced balance of wet and dry strength properties to a cellulosic substrate while leaving the substrate soft and porous. The compositions comprise a hydrophilic air curing polymer and a polyol with a carbon to oxygen ratio of less than 3 1, typified by glycerol.
