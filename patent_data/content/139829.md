## Description
REVERSIBLE PHASE CHANGE COMPOSITION FOR STORING ENERGY The invention relates to reversible liquid solid phase change compositions PCM e More particularly, the invention resides in phase change compositions for the storage of energy comprising a mixture of hydrated calcium bromide CaBr2 6H20 and hydrated calcium chloride CaC12 6H20 having added thereto a modifier selected from KBr, KC1, and mixtures thereof. The modifier which is employed with the hydrated CaBr2 CaC12 mixture of the invention is particularly effective to modify the semicongruent melting behavior of the mixture to reduce the formation of crystalline CaBr2 and CaC12 hydrate phases other than the hexahydrate phase. Preferably, the PCM of the invention also includes a nucleating agent which is particularly effective to reduce supercooling of the PCM to less than 30C during retrieval of the stored energy by crystallization. The nucleating agents which have been found to be effective in the PCM of the invention are selected from SrCl21 Ba 0E 2, BaO, SrBr2, Sr OH 2,SrI2, BaI, BaCO3, and mixtures thereof. The invention also resides in the use of thePCM of the particular composition as herein described in an energy storage device and in the method of storing energy. The phase change compositions of the invention are useful over a broad temperature range of from 70 to 500C and thus can be employed 1 for the st6rage of coolness over a temperature range of from 70 to 170C 2 for the storage of heat over a temperature range of from 250 to 500C, and 3 as a buffer or heat sink to modulate diurnal swings in the ambient temperature range of from 170 to 270C. Phase change matevials in which the heat of fusion of various hydrated salt compositions is employed are well known in the literature. In ASHRAE Journal ofSeptember 1974, pages 38 45, N. Telkes in an article entitled Solar Energy Storage , evaluated the thermal, physical and other pertinent properties of PCM s on the basis of economics, applicability, corrosion, toxicity, and availability for large scale installations.Among the materials evaluated were various salt hydrates and their eutectics, including eutectics of sodium sulfate decahydrate Glaubers Salt Na2SO4 101120 which melts at the relatively low temperature of 130C which is adapted for the storage of coolness1 . A eutectic is mentioned consisting of a mixture of sodium sulfate decahydrate with ammonium chloride NH4C1 and sodium chloride NaCl , which decrease the normal melting point of the sodium sulfate decahydrate from 320 to 130C. Borax is used as a nucleating agent and an inorganic thickening agent is added to prevent settling. The purpose of storing coolness , as described by M. Telkes, is to lessen peak time power demands from air conditioners which can cause brown outs during hot summer days. The system uses a standard heat pump air conditioner, which is operated during the night, for storing up coolness in the PCM by freezing it at a temperture of 130C. During the day, when cooling is needed, the stored coolness is released by blowing room air through heat exchangers filled with the phase change material. In this way, peak demands for electric power can be diminished, resulting in peak shaving.The PCM is liquefied after the stored coolness is extracted as night approaches and the peak electric demand is over. After about 10 p.m., the air conditioner resumes operation, cooling the PCM again, completely solidifying it by early morning. The coolness storage material is thus re used every day, as needed. PCM s for use in a temperature range between 30 and 11 C were also investigated by S. I. Friedman and J. C. Dudley as described in report NSF RANN SE GI 27976 TR 72 9, entitled Off Peak Air ConditioningUsing Thermal Energy Storage , August 1972. Here, the authors report that the salt hydrate of Na2SO4 NH4Cl low20 melts incongruently, with the salt being partially soluble in the water of crystallization. The authors also report that long term maintenance at temperatures below the freezing point resulted in additional water diffusing to the unhydrated salt, thereby forming additional crystalline salt hydrate. Research was then in progress on the freezing of salt hydrates in an attempt to make the theoretical amount of the latent heat of fusion available.This work involved the use of thickening agents to prevent separation of the saturated liquid and precipitate. In ASME, September 1, 1977, J. D. Meakin et al., in an article entitled Coolness Storage in aSodium Sulfate Decahydrate Mixture , tested a combination of salts that M. Telkes had reported on for use as aPCM at a temperature of approximately 130C. In three independent tests, the authors concluded that the salt performed as if the undissolved anhydrous sodium sulfate was not able to combine with its water of hydration during an eight hour hydration process. As a result, the heat of transformation was less than anticipated.The authors finally concluded that there were continued difficulties in measuring the performance of the salt system sodium sulfate decahydrate because heating and cooling rates had a significant effect on performance.In effect, the authors found that the heat storage capacity of the sodium sulfate mixture was only one half that anticipated by the complete diffusion theory.Accordingly, sodium sulfate decahydrate admixed with other salts for the storage of coolness has not proven to be economically effective even with the addition of thickening agents to combat the tendency of the PCM toward stratification and settling out of solid sodium sulfate to the bottom of the container. U.K. Patent No. 1,531,953, issued to C. Doomernik,November 15, 1978, discloses a cold accumulator, comprising a container filled with a eutectic mixture and provided with heat exchange surfaces which separate the eutectic mixture from passages for a refrigerating agent which serves as a means for passing the refrigerating agent through the passages for liquefaction melting and freezing, respectively, of the eutectic mixture. Doomernik reports that large industrial installations, such as slaughter houses, have to supply a great amount of cold during the period wherein meat is brought into the slaughter house and for some additional time thereafter until the desired low temperature is reached again. In most cases, however, large refrigerating capacity is only necessary during working hours, usually for about eight hours a day, while during the rest of the time there need only be supplied a sufficient amount of coolness to compensate for the losses due to incomplete insulation. In such cases, employment of a cold accumulator renders it possible to use a much smaller refrigerating apparatus which, however, may work continuously. The extra cooling required during the peak hours may then be derived from the accumulator.The eutectic mixture in the accumulator is then refrozen in the period when there is little loss of cold from the freezers. Accordingly, Doomernik reports that it is possible to profit by the cheap night tariff rate for supply of electric current and, at the same time, avoid the surcharges which may be imposed by an electric supply company during high peak loads. Doomernik makes specific reference to eutectic mixtures of water with MgSO4 7H2O which melts at a eutectic temperature of 5.2 C with KC1 having a eutectic temperature of 10.70C and NH4C1 having a eutectic temperature of 15.8 C . Other eutectic mixtures are mentioned which melt at temperatures of from 21 to 550C. Other prior developments particularly concerned with the storage of coolness are, for example, Japanese Patent No. 76 76183 to Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.The patent discloses a coolness storage material comprising CaC12 6E2O admixed with MgBr2 6H2O andSr OH 2 having a melting temperature of 120C, andJapanese Publication No. 75 90582 to Mitsubishi ElectricCorporation published July 19, 1975, which discloses a cold storage material having a melting point of 100C and comprising a mixture of CÅaCl2 6H2O with one or more additives selected from FeC13 NaCl KCl and NH4Cl. None of the aforementioned publications address themselves to PCM s comprising mixtures ofCaBr2 and CaCl2. More particularly, none of these publications disclose PCM s comprising mixtures ofCaBr2 and CaCl2 having added thereto a modifier selected from KCl, KBr, or mixtures thereof. As previously alluded to, in addition to PCM s for the storage of coolness , the present invention also envisions PCM s which have proven to be useful for the storage of heat. Heat storage materials are, of course, well known from the literature and are described by David Eissenberg and Charles Wyman inSolar Age, May, 1980 pages 12 16, in an article entitled What s In Store for Phase Change. On page 16, Eissenberg et al lists various PCM s which have found acceptance in industry and the home, e.g., paraffin Glauber s salt and CaCl2 6H2O with additives. These PCM s are useful as heat storage materials and have a phase change temperature over the range of from 180 to 460C. A comprehensive discussion of PCM s for use as thermal energy storage materials is given in SolarHeat Storage, Latent Heat Materials, by G. A. Lane, CRCPress, Boca Raton, Florida, 1983, pages 2 48, 143 148. Reference can also be made to 1 JapanesePublication No. 81 08483, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, published January 28, 1981, which discloses a PCM comprising CaCl2 6H2O and or CaBr2 61120 which is mixed with a small amount of an agent for preventing supercooling such as BaHPO4 and other barium salts.The mixture solidifies at a temperature of 220C and generates 68.5 cal cm3 heat of fusion at 290C 2 JapanesePatent Publication No. 76 43387, Mitsubishi ElectricCorporation, published April 14, 1976, for a composition comprising a mixture of CaC12 6H2O and MgC12 6H2O having a melting point of 30 C, and 3 Japanese PatentNo. 969,909, Hitachi Ltd., granted August 31, 1979, for a PCM of CaC126H2O containing various barium and strontium salts as seed crystals to prevent supercooling. None of the aforementioned publications disclose PCM s of the invention which melt over the broad temperature range of from 70 to 50 C and which are comprised of mixtures of CaBr2 6H20 and CaCl26H2O having added thereto a modifier selected from KCl, KBr or mixtures thereof to modify the semicongruent melting behavior of the hydrated CaBr2 CaCl2 mixture to reduce the formation of crystalline hydrate phases other than the CaBs2 CaC12 6H20 phase. In addition to PCM s which are useful for the storage of coolness over a temperture range of from 70 to 170C, and for the storage of heat over a temperature range of from 250 to 500C, the present invention also includes within its scope PCM s which have proven to be useful as Buffers or heat sinks for modulating diurnal fluctuations in the ambient temperature range of from 170 to 270C. Such buffers or heat sinks are particularly useful in passive solar heated buildings or structures such as greenhouses or hothouses. Excess solar energy received during the daytime is used to melt or partially melt the PCM. At night, this energy is recovered by freezing the PCN and is transported or allowed to radiate to the building s other tempered space to raise the temperature, i.e. to heat the building or space. The subject of thermal buffering or PCM heat sinks is discussed by Schneider et al., in the proceedings of the Journeys Internationales d Etude sur le ChauffageSolaire dans le Batiment, in Liege, Belgium, September 12 14, 1977, Paper No. 40. None of the aforementioned heat storage material describe the unique composition of the invention in which the semicongruent melting behavior of the hydrated CaBr2 CaCl2 mixture has been modified with a modifier selected from KCl, KBr or mixtures thereof to reduce the formation of crystalline hydrate phases other than the hexahydrate phase. The present invention particularly resides in a reversible liquid solid phase change composition comprising an admixture of hydrated CaBr2 and Caul2, wherein said mixture additionally has added thereto a modifier selected from KBr, KCl and mixtures thereof, said modifier bring added in an amount sufficient to modify the semicongruent melting behavior of the hydrated CaBr2 CaC12 mixture to reduce the formation of crystallineCaBr2 CaC12 hydrate phases other than the hexahydrate phase. The invention further resides in an energy storage device comprising an encapsulating means having a reversible liguid solid phase change composition hermetically sealed in said encapsulating means to prevent the evaporation of water from the composition, said composition melting at a temperature of from 70 to 500C and comprising a hydrated mixture of from 20 to 67 weight percent CaBr2 from greater than zero to 38 weight percent CaCl2 from 28 to 50 weight percent water, and a modifier selected from KBr, KCl and mixtures thereof, said modifier being added in an amount greater than zero but less than 10 weight percent and sufficient to modify the semicongruent melting behavior of the CaBr2 CaCl2 mixture to reduce, during freezing of the composition, the formation of crystalline CaBr2 and Caul2 hydrate phases other than the hexahydrate phase. The invention additionally resides in a method of storing energy, comprising the steps of preparing a reversible liquid solid phase change composition, which melts at a temperature from 7 to 500C, by admixing from 20 to 67 weight percent CaBr2, from greater than zeroto 38 weight percent CaC12 and from 28 to 50 weight percent water to form a hydrated mixture, adding a modifier in an amount greater than zero but less than 10 weight percent and in an amount sufficient to modify the semicongruent melting behavior of the CaBr CaCl2 mixture to reduce, during freezing of the composition, the formation of crystalline hydrate phases other than the hexahydrate phase, said modifier being selected from KBr, KCl and mixtures thereof, introducing the composition into an encapsulating means for use as an energy storage device, and hermetically sealing the encapsulating means to prevent the escape of water vapors from the encapsulating means. The composition of the present invention preferably has added thereto one or more nucleating agents in an amount sufficient to reduce supercooling of the composition to less than about 30C during crystallization. Preferably, the nucleating agent is added in an amount greater than zero and up to 5.0 weight percent. More preferably, the nucleating agent is added in an amount of from 0.50 to 2.0 weight percent.Although amounts greater than 5.0 weight percent may be present in the composition without detriment to the function of the composition, nucleators in amounts greater than 5.0 weight percent generally do not show any further benefits in reducing supercooling. The term enthalpy used herein defines a thermodynamic function of a system, equivalent to the internal energy plus the product of the pressure and the volume. Enthalpy is measured by the heat content per unit mass, e.g., in BTU s per pound. The term congruent melting herein used defines a mixture of ingredients, based on hydrated CaBr2 CaC12 for which, at the melting point, solid and liquid phases are in stable equilibrium, i.e., the solid phase contains no hydrated CaBr2 or CaCl2 other than the hexahydrate or solid solutions thereof, and the liquid phase contains, for every mole of CaBr2 andCaC12, 6 moles of water plus sufficient water to form the stable hydrate of any additive materials in solution. Semicongruent melting occurs when a phase change material has two or more hydrate forms with differing solid compositions and melting points. The material can be transformed in other hydrate forms before either complete melting or freezing occurs, resulting in a broadened melting point range. In addition, there is the temporary loss in thermal storage capacity. Calcium chloride hexahydrate is an example of a semicongruently melting phase change material. Incongruent melting phase change materials yield two distinct phases upon melting, i.e., a saturated solution and a precipitate of an insoluble anhydrous salt. If the precipitate settles out of the solution, the anhydrous salt will not hydrate completely upon cooling and some thermal storage capacity will be lost with each freeze melting cycle. Incongruent melting, as observed with sodium sulfate decahydrate, for example, is a more serious problem because it can result in a continual loss of latent heat storage capacity. The term supercooling refers to a discrepancy between the temperature at which freezing initiates and the melting temperature of a given liquid solid phase change material when cooled and heated under quiescent conditions. The term eutectic or eutectic mixture designates a mixture of two or more components mixed.in such a ratio that the melting point of the mixture is lower than that of either salt, and the entire mixture at one and the same temperature passes from the solid form into the liquid form, and vice versa. The term modifier includes, in addition to the KCl, KBr, and mixtures thereof such as have been specified herein, the precursors of such modifiers which are non detrimental to the function of the PCN s of the invention. More particularly, the modifiers herein referred to are either anhydrous or hydrated compositions of potassium salt precursors which would form the potassium salt upon addition to the hydratedCaBr2 CaCl2 mixture. It has been found that the composition of the invention is also improved by the addition of a small amount of NaCl and or NaBr which lowers the freezing point of the composition. Impurities may also be present in the PCM of the invention in minor amounts of less than about 3.0 weight percent and provided that such impurities do not detrimentally affect the function of the basic hydratedCaBr2 CaCl2 mixture. Impurities may include, for example, LiCl MgCl2 or other calcium salts such asCaCO3 or CaSO4. For air conditioning, a PCM should preferably melt at a temperature at least 50C below the temperature of a room or space so that efficient heat exchange can be obtained between room air and the coolness storage material. Accordingly, at a room temperature of about 220C the maximum useful PCM melting point is about 170C. As the freezing point of the PCM becomes lower, i.e., lower than about 50C, the refrigeration equipment which is used to charge the coolness storage increases in size and rating. Accordingly, a minimum practicalPCM freezing point is about 70C. One aspect of the present invention resides in the development of a PCM for storing coolness in which the PCM melts at a temperature of from 7 to 170C and, more particularly, a composition which is substantially congruent melting. It has been discovered that a PCM based on a minimum melting mixture of CaBr2. 6H2O and CaCl26H2O melts at a temperature of about 16 C. This mixture is not fully congruent melting, however, since some tetrahydrate crystals can form during freezing, thereby decreasing the storage capacity of the PCM.This defect was overcome by adding a suitable potassium salt, preferably KCl, KBr, or mixtures thereof to the composition. Examples of PCM s which are particularly well adapted for storage of coolness and melting in the temperature range of from 70 to 170C are the following, in their order of preference with Example 3A being the most preferred composition Example 1A CaBr2 from 28 to 43 wt. CaCl2 from 14 to 31 wt. KBr and or KCl in an amount of greater than zero and less than 10 wt. B20 balance of up to 100 wt. .Example 2A CaBr2 from 30 to 41 wt. CaC12 from 18 to 26 wt. KBr and or KCl from 2 to 5 wt 1120 balance of up to 100 wt. . Example 3A CaBr2 from 32 to 37 wt. CaCl2 from 20 to 24 wt. KBr and or KC1 from 3 to 4 wt. 1120 balance of up to 100 wt. . Examples of PCM s which are particularly well adapted as heat storage materials melting in the range of from 250 up to 500C are the following, in their order of preference with Example 3B being the most preferred composition Example 1B CaBr2 from 47 to 67 wt. CaCl2 greater than zero but less than 10 wt. KBr and or KCl in an amount greater than zero and less than 10 wt. H20 from 29 to 43 wt. . Example 2B CaBr2 from 50 to 66 wt. CaCl2 greater than zero but less than 10 wt. KBr and or KCl from 2 to 5 wt. H2O from 29 to 43 wt. . Example 3B CaBr2 from 52 to 65 wt. CaC12 greater than zero but less than 10 wt. KBr and or KC1 from 3 to 4 wt. H20 from 33 to 36 wt. . Examples of PCM s which are particularly well adapted as temperature buffers or heat sinks in passive solar energy heated structures melting in the temperature range of from 170 to 270C are the following, in their order of preference with Example 3C being the most preferred composition Example 1C CaBr2 from 38 to 55 wt. CaCl2 from 10 to 25 wt. KBr and or KCl in an amount greater than zero and less than 10 wt. H2O from 29 to 43 wt. .Example 2C CaBr2 from 42 to 55 wt. CACTI from 10 to 17 wt. KBr and or KC1 from 2 to 5 wt. H20 from 36 to 40 wt .Example 3C CaBr2 from 46 to 52 wt. Cad2 from 10 to 15 wt. KBr and or KC1 from 2 to 5 wt 20 from 37 to 39 wt. . Examples of PCM s which are particularly well adapted as temperature buffers or heat sinks in passive solar energy heated structures melting in the temperature range of from 170 to 270C are the following, in their order of preference with Example 6C being the most preferred composition Example 4C CaBr2 from 20 to 28 wt CaC12 from 21 to 38 wt. KBr and or KC1 in an amount greater than zero and less than 10 wt. 1120 balance up to 100 wt. .Example SC CaBr2 from 20 to 28 wt. CaC12 from 25 to 36 wt. KBr and or KC1 from 2 to 5 wt. H2 balance up to 100 wt. . Example 6C CaBr2 from 20 to 28 wt. CaC12 from 28 to 35 wt KBr and or KCl from 3 to 4 wt. H20 balance up to 100 wt. . Although the amount of KBr and or KC1 present in each of the above compositions is stated to be greater than zero weight percent it should be sufficient to improve the freezing behavior of the PCM. It has been found that an amount of greater than 10 weight percent generally has no additional benefit in the freezing behavior of the PCM. The present invention preferably also provides for the addition of select nucleating agents in order to reduce supercooling in the hydrated CaBr2 CaCl2 mixture. The avoidance of supercooling during the crystallization of hydrated PCM s, as by the addition of various nucleating agents, is generally known in the literature. In addition to publications previously cited, reference is here made to Japanese Publication 76 70,193 Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and SwedishPatent No. 410,004, issued January 3, 1980. The storage materials described in these publications are based on a Cad2 61120 composition. Reference is also made toApplicants copending U.S. applications Serial No.364,159, filed March 31, 1982 and Serial No. 417,275, filed September 13, 1982, both applications by G. A.Lane, et al. Nucleators which have been found to be effective with the PCM of the invention are barium and strontium salts, or mixtures thereof. Suitable nucleators are SrCl21 Ba OH 2, BaO, SrBr2, Sr OH 2, SrI2, Bay,, BaCO3, and mixtures thereof. The following examples illustrate the effectiveness of reversible liquid solid phase change compositions of the invention for storage of energy based on mixtures of hydrated CaBr2 and CaC12. Example 7 This example is not an example of the invention but is included to show how a minimum melting mixture of CaBr2 6H2O and Cad2 61120 was identified. A container of melted CaBr26H20 was cooled until a substantial quantity of crystals had been formed and an equilibrium had been established. Melted CaC12 6H2O was then added by increments, allowing equilibrium to be established after each addition. At the equilibrium condition, the equilibrium temperature of the liquid composition was determined. The liquid composition was determined by chemical and instrument analysis.The minimum melting composition was found at a temperature of 15.80C and contained 54.0 weight percent.CaBr26H2O and 46.0 weight percent CaC12 6H2O. Example 8 This example is also not an example of the invention but shows that the minimum melting composition of Example 7 is semicongruently melting, that is, at equilibrium the tetrahydrate species crystallize initially before hexahydrate crystals begin to form. A container of the following melted salt mixture comprising 32.0 weight percent CaBr2 21.0 weight percent Caul2, and 47.0 weight percent HzO was prepared and cooled until a substantial quantity of crystals had formed and equilibrium had been established.A melted material of the composition comprising 38.0 weight percent CaBr2 25.3 weight percent Cad2, and 36.7 weight percent 1120, was then added incrementally, allowing equilibrium to be attained after each addition, and determining equilibrium temperature and liquid composition. From the data thus generated, the hexahydrate and tetrahydrate liquidi were obtained, and their intersection point, the peritectic point, was found to be at 16.30C and the composition was analyzed at 34.0 weight percent CaBr2 23.2 weight percent CaC12, and 42.8 weight percent 1120. This composition was analyzed to contain 6.27 moles of water per gram atom of calcium. At a ratio of 6.00 moles of water per gram atom of calcium, the tetrahydrate liquidus was found to be at a temperature of 19.30C. Thus, the hexahydrate composition must cool about 3.00C, forming tetrahydrate crystals, at equilibrium, before the hexahydrate crystals can begin to form.This segregation of the material causes reduced heat storage capacity for the PCM. Example 9 This experiment is an example of the invention and was conducted in the same manner as Example 7, except that the starting material was CaBr2 6H20 saturated with KBr, and the material added incrementally was CaC12 6H2O saturated with KC1. The minimum melting composition was found at a temperature of 14,60C and the composition contained 53.9 weight percent CaBr2 6H2O 42.9 weight percent CaC12 6H20 1.9 percent KBr, and 1.3 percent KC1. Example 10 This experiment is an example of the invention and was conducted in the same manner as Example 8, except that the starting material was of the following composition 32.9 weight percent CaBr2 19.7 weight percent Caul2 41.4 weight percent H2O 3.0 weight percent KBr, and 3.0 weight percent KC1. A mixture of the following composition was added incrementally 37.5 weight percent CaBr2 22.5 weight percent CaC12 33.9 weight percent H,O 3.0 weight percent KBr, and 3.0 weight KC1. In this example, however, the hexahydrate and tetrahydrate liquidi were found to intersect at a eutectic rather than peritectic point at a temperature of 14.70C, The ratio of water to calcium was about 5.9 moles of water per gram atom of calcium.Further, at a ratio of 6.00 moles of water per gram atom of calcium, the hexahydrate liquidus was found to be at a temperature of 14.70C, indicating a congruent melting system with no tetrahydrate formation at equilibrium. Example 11 This experiment is an example of the invention and was conducted in the same manner as Example 8, except that the starting material was of the following composition 43.4 percent CaBr2 13.3 percent Cacti2 39.7 percent E2 2.7 percent KBr, 0.9 percent KC1 and the material which was added incrementally having the following composition 46.0 percent CaBr2, 13.6 percent Caul2 36.7 percent H,O 2.7 percent KBr, 0.9 percent KCl. The hexahydrate and tetrahydrate liquidi were found to intersect at a temperature of 19.70C, and at about 6.09 moles of water per gram atom of calcium, indicating a system in which very little tetrahydrate can form.Example 12 This experiment is an example of the invention and was conducted in the same manner as Example 8, except that the starting material was of the following composition 48.0 weight percent CaBr2 9.6 weight percent CaC12 38.4 weight percent 11O 3.3 weight percent KBr, and 0.8 weight percent KCl and the material added incrementally had the composition 51.1 weight percent CaBr2, 10.2 weight percent CaC12 35.1 weight percent H20 2.9 weight percent KBr, and 0.7 weight percent Kol. The hexahydrate and tetrahydrate liquidi were found to intersect at a temperature of 240C, and at about 5.8 moles of water per gram atom of calcium, indicating a system in which no tetrahydrate will form at equilibrium.Example 13 This example is an example of the invention, and was conducted in the same manner as Example 7, except that the starting material was CaBr2 6H2O saturated with KBr and NaBr, and the material added incrementally was Caul2 6H2O saturated with KC1 and NaCl. The minimum melting composition was found at a temperature of 14.20C, and the composition contained 24.7 weight percent CaBr2 30.4 weight percent CaC12 2.0 weight percent KBr 2.5 weight percent KC1 0.2 weight percentNaBr 0.2 weight percent NaCl and 40.0 weight percent H2O. This composition is improved over that of Example 9, in that addition of NaBr and or NaCl has lowered the melting temperature.Example 14 This experiment is an example of the invention in which a sample containing 34.57 weight percentCaBr2 21.98 weight percent CaC12 40.19 weight percent HO 1.90 weight percent KBr, and 1.36 weight percent KCl was divided into several aliquots, and freezingmelting tests were conducted. One of the aliquots was tested without any additives, but various nucleating agents were added to the other aliquots at the level of 0.5 weight percent in order to determine the effectiveness of such nucleators in the mixture. In each case, ten freeze thaw cycles were induced by immersing a glass container with 80 grams of the material alternately in ice water and room temperature. Temperature of the sample was obtained from a thermocouple placed in the center of the sample. For each freezing cycle, the amount of supercooling cooling below the melting point before onset of crystallization was noted and these values were averaged for the ten cycles. Table I summarizes the data obtained with the addition of selected nucleators.
