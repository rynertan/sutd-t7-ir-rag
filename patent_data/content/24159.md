# Cryogenic freezer.

## Abstract
A cryogenic freezer of the elongated, tunnel type is dis closed in which a centrally located blower recirculates injected cryogenic refrigerant at extremely high velocities through a pair of minimum size product contact chambers. In the preferred embodiment, the cross sectional area of the product contact chamber is variable so as to maintain minimum sizes for products of different height.
