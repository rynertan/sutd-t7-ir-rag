# SNAPLOCK CONNECTION, E.G. FOR A DRAWER UNIT

## Abstract
A removable accessory 6 such as a drawer unit can be mounted to the underside of a work surface 4 without the use of tools by engagement of a pair of front and rear slot and projection couplings 11, 12 . A spring 38 automatically locks the accessory 6 to the work surface 4 when the projections 33, 41 24 are fully engaged with the slots 14, 19 . The front projection 33, 41 enters a wide portion 18 of the front slot 14 as the horizontal part 28 of the rear projection 24 enters the rear slot 19 , and then a flange 41 on the front projection 33, 41 is trapped above a narrow portion 17 of the front slot 13 as the accessory 6 is pushed rearwards, and the spring 38 snaps up into its locking position against the front edge of the front slot 14 .
