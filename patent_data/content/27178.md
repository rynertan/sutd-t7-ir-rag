# Filling machine and method for automatically filling bottles with high purity liquid.

## Abstract
A plurality of bottles 125 or other containers are delivered and aligned under a plurality of filler heads 110 each having a liquid feed channel 113 extending vertically downward to outwardly opening apertures 119 and also an inert gas feed channel 116 extending vertically downward to a lower end 117 below the apertures 119 . The bottles 125 are moved upward 134 and chemicals are delivered into the bottles 125 through the liquid feed channel 113 and apertures 119 . When the liquid level 127 of each bottle reaches the lower end 117 , the back pressure in the inert gas feed channel 116 is sensed 123 and the liquid flow is shut off 120 . Contamination of the bottles by particulates is minimized since no moving parts are required above the level of the bottles and because no contact is required between the filler heads and the bottles.
