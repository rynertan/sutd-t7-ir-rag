# Two phase motor.

## Abstract
The two phase motor comprises a permanent magnet motor 2 , magnetised so as to have a pair of north and south poles diametrically opposed. The stator 1 comprises four poles 5,6,7,8 which are arranged around the rotor with each covering substantially 90 degrees of the circumference. The first stator coil 4 surrounds the magnetic bridge linking the outer limbs 9,12 whilst a second stator coil surrounds the magnetic circuit joining the limbs 9,12 to the two poles 6,7 . The upper sections of the limbs 9,12 form the magnetic circuit to the two other poles 5,8 . The phase shifted coils 3,4 connect to the two phase supply to produce a two pole rotating magnetic field. Instead of connection to a two phase supply to produce the rotating field, the same effect is achieved by connecting the two coils to a single phase supply with a capacitor in series with one coil to achieve a suitable phase displacement.

## Description
tlTwo phase motor . The invention relates to a two phase motor having a stator and a rotor, provided with a first stator winding, a second stator winding and a stator body which comprises, viewed along the rotor circumference and in this order, first, second, third and fourth stator poles, and which also comprises first, second, third and fourth magnetically conductive portions which extend from the first, second, third and fourth stator poles, respectively, a first magnetically conductive circuit being formed which extends from the first and second stator poles to the third and fourth stator poles via the first and second portions, the first stator winding and the third and fourth portions, the first stator winding being arranged around a magnetically conducting connecting part which connects the first and second portions to the third and fourth portions and which extends in a first direction which is substantially transverse to the rotor axis. Such a motor is known, for example from UnitedStates Patent Specification no. 3,052,806. In this motor a winding is arranged around both the first and fourth portions, which windings are electrically connected in series to form a second stator winding. The windings are arranged around those parts of the first and fourth portions which connect the first stator pole and the fourth stator pole to the second stator pole and the third stator pole respectively. It is an object of the invention to provide a motor of the type set forth in the opening sentence, which is of a simple construction. To this end the invention is characterized in that the second and third magnetically conductive portions extend at least partly directly adjacent each other and are both surrounded by the second stator winding both in a direction substantially transverse to the rotor axis and transverse to the first direction, so that a second magnetically conductive circuit being formed which extends from the second and third stator poles to the first and fourth stator poles via the second and third portions, the second stator winding and the first and fourth portions. The invention will be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the invention in a sectional view taken in a plane perpendicular to the rotor axis, Figure 2 is a sectional view of the motor shown in Figure 1 taken on the line II II, Figure 3 is a sectional view similar to that shown in Figure 1, showing the rotor flux pattern for a first rotor position, Figure 4 is a sectional view similar to that shown in Figure 1, showing the rotor flux pattern for a different rotor position, Figure 5 shows a variant of the embodiment shown in Figure 1, and Figure 6 shows a variant of the motor shown inFigure 1, comprising a rotor having two pole pairs. Figure 1 shows a motor in accordance with the invention in a sectional view taken in a plane perpendicular to the rotor axis taken on the line I I in Figure 2 and Figure 2 shows this motor in a sectional view taken in a plane containing the rotor axis taken on the line II II in Figure 1 . The motor comprises a permanent magnetic rotor 2, which is magnetised so as to have two diametrically opposite poles N, S . The stator 1 comprises four poles 5, 6, 7 and 8, which are arranged around the rotor and which each cover substantially 900 of the rotor circum ference. The stator body comprises four portions 9, 10, 11 and 12 which terminate in the stator poles 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively. The portions 9 and 10 are connected to the portions 11 and 12 via a first stator coil 4, a second stator coil 3 being arranged around the two portions 10 and 11. The operation of the motor shown is explained with reference to Figures 3 and 4 which show the rotorflux patterns for two rotor positions. In Figure 3 the rotor magnetisation is oriented from the poles 7 and 8 to the poles 5 and 6. The flux intercepted by the poles 5 and 6 flows via the portions 9 and 10 through the stator coil 4 and via the portions 11 and 12 to the poles 7 and 8. Inside the coil 3 the flux through the portion 10 is oriented oppositely to the flux through the portion 11. For this position of the rotor 2 the rotor flux is fully coupled to the coil 4 and is not coupled to the coil 3.After a rotation of the rotor through 900 the rotor 2 is oriented from poles 6 and 7 to poles 5 and 8. The flux intercepted by pole 5 flows via portion 9 and portion 10 through coil 3 to the pole 6, and the flux intercepted by the pole 8 flows via portion 12 and portion 11 through coil 3 to pole 7. No rotor flux is coupled to coil 4 because the rotor flux emerging from portion 9 is oriented oppositely to the rotor flux issuing from portion 12, the coupling of the rotor flux with the coil 3 being maximum.From the foregoing it follows that upon rotation of the rotor two 900 phase shifted voltages are induced into the coils 3 and 4. Conversely, upon application of 900 phase shifted alternating voltages to the coils 3 and 4 the rotor is set into rotation, which 900 phase shifted alternating voltages can be derived from a single phase alternating voltage by means of a capacitor.Thus, the motor in accordance with the invention operates as a two phase motor and may be regarded as a motor having two stators which have been shifted through 900 relative to each other, a first stator having one pole formed by the poles 7 and 8 in combination and another pole formed by the poles 5 and 6 in combination, the poles thus formed cooperating with the coil 4, and a second stator having one pole which is formed by the poles 5 and 8 in combination and another pole formed by the poles 6 and 7 in combination, the poles thus formed cooperating with the coil 3. Many variants are possible to the embodiment shown in Figure 1. Figure 5 shows such a variant in which the coil 4 and the coil 3 are arranged on opposite sides of the rotor 2. Figure 6 shows a variant in which the rotor has a four pole magnetization and the four stator poles 5, 6, 7 and 8 are arranged along substantially 1800 of the rotor circumference, each covering substantially 450. When an alternating voltage of a given frequency is applied to it the rate of revolution of this variant will be half that of the motor shown in Figure 1 for the same applied frequench. The variant shown in Figure 6 may alternatively be of a symmetrical construction, i.e. having eight poles and four coils. If in the motor described in the foregoing coil 3 were to be dispensed with and the portions 9 and 10 and stator poles 5 and 6 on the one hand and the portions 11 and 12 and stator poles 7 and 8 on the other hand were to be constructed as integral units, a known type of singlephase svnchronous motor would be obtained. This clearly illustrates that the motor described in the foregoing demands hardly any more volume than the known single phase synchronous motor. Although the embodiments of the invention described in the foregoing comprise a permanent magnetic rotor, so that the motor is a swrnchronous motor, the principle of the invention may also be used in asynchro nous motors and in variable reluctance motors.
