# Industrial robot having a sensor unit.

## Abstract
An industrial robot comprises an arm 16, a driving source for driving the arm, an operation unit such as a paint spray nozzle 22 at the tip of the arm, and a sensor unit 23 at the tip of the arm near the operation unit, for example to detect and open a door of a box like object to be painted internally. The sensor unit comprises a sensor 31 for detecting a workpiece which is to be subjected to an operation carried out by the operation unit, a shutter 36 for opening and closing the front of the sensor, and a mechanism for opening the shutter at least while the sensor carries out a detecting operation to detect the workpiece, and for closing the shutter at least while the operation unit carries out the operation.
