# SHEET FEEDING DEVICE.

## Abstract
A device which picks up, one by one, sheets of paper on which data has been recorded, said sheets being stacked on top of each other and delivers them to a predetermined position where the recorded data may be use. Air flow through tubes 2 connected to suction means is cut off by a paper sheet over the mouth of the tube 10 , thereby forming a partial vacuum in the tube 2 which causes the sheet 10 to adhere to the mouth of the tube. Then, the tube 2 itself is raised by the pull of the partial vacuum, thereby separating the sheets 10 one by one. Thus, an entire stack of sheets 10 can be effectively picked up one by one.
