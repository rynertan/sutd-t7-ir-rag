# A METHOD FOR MEASURING THE POSITION OF A FRAME SAW BLADE

## Abstract
A method for orienting the blade of especially a frame saw, in which case the light from light transmitters 1 at tached to the blade 5 is aimed at measuring scales 3, 4 on a measuring plane 2 in order to determine the orien tation of the blade along three planes perpendicular to each other. Alternatively, the light from the light transmitters 1 can be reflected onto the measuring scale 3, 4 via mirrors 7 attached to the blade 5 .
