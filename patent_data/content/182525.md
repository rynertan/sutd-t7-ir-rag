# Apparatus for use in teaching mathematics.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises a horizontal board 3 , which is divided into eleven zones 4 , and a vertical board 1 , which is divided into eleven vertically extending zones 8 and two horizontally extending zones 9 and has two outwardly projecting subsidiary boards 2 . In use, objects see Figure 5 can be placed in selected zones 4 of the horizontal board 3 to demonstrate a mathematical operation for example addition or subtraction and information relating to the operation is writ ten on appropriate zones 8 of the vertical board 1 and on the subsidiary boards 2 . The horizontal board 3 has a bevelied front edge portion 6 , on which further information can be written, and two portions 5 in which objects to be placed in the zones 4 of the horizontal board 3 can be placed before hand.
