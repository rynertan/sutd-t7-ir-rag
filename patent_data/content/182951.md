## Description
An electronic device for the progressive lighting of a neon tube and similar Alessandro BRESSAN Paolo SIMONESCHI Pietro SFORNAVia Frassinoro, 33 Via Ulpiano, 1 Via Cerisano, 68ROMA Italy LATINA Italy ROMA Italy The present invention concerns an electronic device for the progressive lighting of a neon tube or similar, i.e. for the advancing of the luminous end of the inner gas.It is well known that a neon lamp usually is lit with a potential difference applied to the electrodes and being variable according to the length of the tube, and with an alternate current of 50 Hz.The present invention has its origin in the experimental verification of the fact that, applying a D.D.P. with a frequency major than 50 Hz to the ends of a neon tube, e.g. about 5.000 40.000 Hz, the gradual lighting of the inner gas from the electrodes towards the centre is obtained.It is the aim of the present invention to gradually light a tube starting from one electrode towards the other one, to adjust said lighting, to make it get back and advance with spectacular results, particularly fit for the composition of light games for neon signs, decorations and similar.The present invention shows the advantages that the progressive lighting, the return and the adjusting may be determined by different sources like, e.g., a musical signal, so as to allow a coordination between sound and light and that straight tubes as well as curved tubes, forming e.g. luminous letters and figures, may be lit.The present invention comprises an electronic device for supplying the neon tube with the proper tensions and frequencies for the desired lighting and a particular connection of the tube with one electrode connected to the positive pole of the device and the other electrode provided with a high tension wire with insulation of the other negative pole outlet.Said connection proved to be fit for the application thereof to tubes of up to two meters length, while the direct connection of the two electrodes of the tube with the device s outlets is provided by the present invention for longer tubes, providing each tube with a conductor material stripe being liable with one electrode and placed on the outside of the glass until a distance of a few centimeters from the other electrode for exploiting the overtensions produced on the glass for lighting the inner gas.The result is relevant, like a pen writing the light inside the tubes, following the shape thereof.The present invention will be described more in detail nereinbelow relating to the attacehd drawing showing the scheme of a preferred embodiment.The figure shows an electronic device for the progressive lighting of the neon gas N tube with stripe S, characterized in a transistor T1 for the generation of constant current for gra dually loading concenser C2 which polarizes the base of transistor T2 RL1 is a cyclic timer allowing T1, in the closed position A of said timer, to load C2 at the speed of RI, while on emitter T2 the gradual tension loads A.T. which unloads the same at the frequency of G1 onto neon gas N, gradually lighting the same. When RL1 is disconnected from position A and connected to position B, condenser C2 unloads at the speed of R2 and the light in the tube gradually diminishes.The device comprises, in the realization thereof, also well known adjusting means for the filling and emptying, means for adjusting the filling and emptying speed and for adjusting the measure of the musical power WU METER effect .
