## Description
Title Storing and Dispensing Paint.DESCRIPTION.Field of invention.This invention relates to a method for storing and dispensing paint, and to a container for the storage of paint and from which paint can be dispensed.Background to the invention.Paint is conventionally stored in metal tins. Metal tins have the disadvantage that it is not possible to see inside the tin without opening the tin, and it is desirable to be able to see inside firstly to check the colour of the paint inside and secondly to see how much paint remains in the tin.Tins also have the disadvantage that they get rusty and the lids become encrusted with paint. When the tins are eventually open, there is the danger of rust particles or other solid matter falling into the paint and spoiling the paint.Summary of the invention.According to a first aspect of the invent i6n, there is provided a paint container comprising flexible bag containing paint and having a resealable outlet for the paint, the bag being positioned inside a box and the outlet being accessible from outside the box.Preferably the bag is transparent and a vertical transparent slot is provided in the side of the box, so that the colour and amount of paint remaining in the bag in the box can be immediately observed.The resealable outlet may be a screw cap which screws onto a threaded neck fitted in the bag. Alternatively the outlet may be a non return valve at the bottom of the container which can be opened to allow paint out without allowing air in.The container may include a rigid pipe extending from the flexible bag to the exterior surface of the box, to form the outlet.A one time use cardboard paint tray having dimensions which fit the dimensions of the box may be secured to the box for point of sale display, so that the box can be sold with a receptacle into which the paint can be decanted. A brush or roller may be included in the pack. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of storing and dispensing paint wherein the paint is poured into a flexible bag which has a resealable outlet, and the bag is closed and placed in a box with the resealable outlet accessible from outside the box. Brief description of the drawings. The invention will now be further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a first embodiment of paint container in accordance with the invention Figures 2 and 3 show alternative forms of resealable outlets Figure 4 is a section through the container of Figure 1 Figure 5 is a section through an alternative form of container Figure 6 is a perspective view of a third form of container in accordance with the invention andFigure 7 is an alternative view of the container of Figure 6.Description of preferred embodiments.The container shown in Figure 1 consists of a box 10 with a handle 12. In its storage position, the paint outlet may be concealed behind a perforated and removable flap 14 in one phase of the cardboard box 10. A narrow vertical slot 16 may be provided in one face of the box to allow the bag inside the box to be viewed from outside, and thus assuming the bag is transparent to view the paint colour. It will be recognised that the box 10 is similar to the form of boxes 1n which wine is sold.Figure 4 shows a section through the box 10. A flexible plastics bag 18 inside the box containes the paint, and has an outlet 20 at a lower corner. Figure 4 shows the outlet 2n projecting through a hole formed after removal of the flap 14. Figure 2 shows one form of outlet which is a non return valve of the type well known for dispensing wine. Figure 3 shows an alternative form where a screw threaded cap 22 is screwed onto a neck 24.The slot 16 in one wall of the box 10 may be provided with a transparent window 26.Figure 5 shows an alternative form of box where a rigid tube 28 extends from the outlet 20 of the bag to the upper face of the box. The pipe 28 extends through the box wall and is then closed by a screw on cap 30. Viewing through the window 16 will reveal the paint level in the rigid tube 28.Figure 6 shows the box 10 shown in earlier figures with the addition of a cardboard tray 32 attached to one side of the box. The dimensions of the tray 32 will be the same as those with the box so that the two can be conveniently joined together by a peel off adhesive strip 34. The tray 32 can be constructed in such a way that it will be watertight and can be used as a paint tray into which paint can be decanted from the bag in the box 10. Inside the tray 32, a paint brush or paint roller can be stored so that a single item on a shop shelf can provide all that is needed to carry out a painting job. To separate the tray 32 and the box 10, the strip 34 is simply pulled off.The container described thus provides a convenient container for paint without the disadvantages of conventional paint tins. The box 10 would normally be opaque, to prevent the paint from any damaging effects of light.Any form of paint can be contained in the container. For oil based paints, it may be more convenient if a nonreturn valve is used so that no air gets into the container to form a skin. If a skin should however form, it is likely to form on top of the paint away from the outlet.
