## Description
DISPLAY DEVICE USING A MULTIPLEX MATRIX DISPLAY PANEL This invention relates to a display device and more particularly to an improvement in a drive circuit for the display device. A multiplex matrix display panel of a display device utilizing a display medium such as liquid crystal comprises, for example, a pair of substrates opposing to each other with a slight gap therebetween, a plurality of scanning electrodes juxtaposed on one confronting surface of the opposing substrates, a plurality of signal electrodes juxtaposed on the other confronting surface, and a liquid crystal serving as the display medium confined in the gap between the opposing substrates, whereby a great number of picture cells arranged in a matrix pattern are formed by opposing portions of the electrodes and liquid crystal confined therebetween.The display panel of this construction is driven for a display operation by changing the magnitude effective value of a voltage applied across the opposing electrodes for each picture cell. One may refer to, for example, Japanese PatentPublication No. 3574 79 and Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid open No. 79491 80 which disclose a drive circuit for this purpose. The drive circuit will be explained with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. Illustrated in Fig. 1 are a matrix display panel 1 of six rows and nine columns, a scanning electrode drive circuit 2, a signal electrode drive circuit 3, and a timing control circuit 4 adapted for the drive circuits 2 and 3. The display panel 1 built up of a pair of substrates and a liquid crystal serving as a display medium confined in a gap between the substrates has a plurality of scanning electrodes Xi i l, 2, , 6 constituting one electrode group and a plurality of signal electrodes Y. j l, 2, , 9 confronting the 3 scanning electrodes and constituting the other electrode group.The two electrode groups are orthogonal to each other and a number of picture cells P.. are formed by opposing portions of the scanning and signal electrodes and liquid crystal confined therebetween, completing a matrix pattern of six rows and nine columns as shown inFig. 1. The number of rows and columns of the matrix can be determined dependent on, for example, the size of the display screen and resolution required for the screen. The scanning electrode drive circuit 2 includes multiplexers 5 and 6. The multiplexer 5 has two two input one output electronic switches SXll andSX12 and it receives four DC voltage signals V1, V2,V5 and V6. One electronic witch SX11 swithches alternately the signals V1 and V6 to transmit an AC selection signal Xs, and the other electronic switch SX12 switches the signals V2 and V5 to transmit an AC non selection signal XNs The multiplexer 6 has a number, corresponding to the number of the scanning electrodes, of two input one output electronic suitches Sx2i i l, 2, , 6 and it is responsive to a control signal of the timing control circuit 4 so as to apply either selection signal X5 or non selection signal iS to the scannint electrodes Xi. In applying these signals, scanning electrode X1 is first applied with the selection signal X5 during a period T1 and the application of the non celection signal XNS to the remaining scanning electrodes Xi i 2, 3, , 6 follows. During a subsequent period T2, the selection signal X5 is applied to the scanning electrode X2, followed by the application of the non selection signal XNs to the remaining scanning electrodes. The sequential application of the selection signal X5 is repeated to perform the scanning operation. Similarly, the signal electrode drive circuit 3 includes multiplexers 7 and 8. In the multiplexer 7, an electronic switch Syll switches DC voltage signalsV1 and V6 to transmit an AC selection signal Yst and an electronic switch Syl2 switches DC voltage signalsV3 and V4 to transmit a non selection signal YNS These signals Y5 and YNS are switched by a number, corresponding to the number of signal electrodes, of electronic switches Sy2j 3 1, 2, , 9 included in the multiplexer 8 and either selection signal Ys or nonselection signal YNS is applied to the signal electrodes Y..During a period Ti, either selection signal YS or 3 non selection signal YNS is applied to the signal electrode Yj in accordance with an image data fed from the timing control circuit 4 corresponding to picture cells Pij j l, 2, , 9 on the i th row. A voltage applied to the liquid crystal corresponds to the difference between the voltages applied to the scanning and signal electrodes. Thus, the magnitudes of DC voltage signals V1 to V6 are set so that an effective voltage exceeding a threshold voltage of the liquid crystal is applied to only particular picture cells P. whose scanning and signal electrodes are applied with the selection signals X5 and YS to thereby turn on the particular picture cells. Fig. 2a illustrates voltage waveforms Vxi andVYj that are applied to the electrodes Xi and Yj when only the picture cells P41, P51 and P61 are turned on.The scanning electrode X1 is applied with the selection signal XS during only the period T1 and with the nonselection signals during the other periods, so that the scanning electrodes are sequentially scanned. The signal electrode Y1 is applied with the selection signal YS during the periods T4, T5 and T6 with the nonselection signal YNS during the periods T1, T2, and T3. The signal electrodes Y2 to Yg are applied with the nonselection signal YNS throughout the periods T1 to T6. Voltages Vpll and Vpl2 applied to the liquid crystal associated, for example, with the picture cellsP11 and P12 correspond to the difference voltage between VX1 and Vyl and the difference voltage betweenVX1 and VY2, respectively, and idealy, effective values of these voltages Vpll and Vpl2 are equal to each other as shown in Fig. 3 The voltages Vpll and Vpl2 are of alternating waveforms with respect to zero volt. Particularly, while the voltages Vyl and Vy2 have different amplitudes during the periods T4, T5 and T6, , it is characteristic to the voltages Vpll and VP12 that they have the same amplitude, although being in opposite phase relationship, throughout these periods. In order to obtain the above voltage relationship, V1 VC, V2 1 aV0 VC, V3 2 3 V0 VC, V4 1 2 a V0 VC, V5 1 1 a V0 VC, and V6 V0 VC, are required to be held for the voltages shown in Fig.2a, where V C and a represent arbitrary constants, of which a is so selected as to fall within the vicinity of N 1 when N is the duty ratio, and V0 represents the maximum amplitude of the voltage VXi VYj applied to the picture cell P. ., being defined as, EMI6.1 when VTH is a threshold voltage of the liquid crystal.For example, when V C stands as shown in Fig. 2b, V1 0, V2 1 aV0, V3 2 aV0, V4 1 2 a V0, and V5 1 1 a V0 are held. The scanning electrode X. is selected once per one frame scanning or for only one period of i x T period interval and the brightness of each associated picture cell is determined by a ratio TA T of the voltage signal V applied to the signal electrodeYj selected during the selection of the scanning electrode Xi. When TA T, the brightness of the picture cell becomes maximum and when TA 0, it becomes minimum.Accordingly, it is possible to provide a display with halftone by arbitrarily changing TA T. In Fig. 2a, only binary states are exemplarily illustrated which correspond to TA T and TA O. Incidentally, in the conventional drive circuit set forth above, on resistance of the electronic switch included in the multiplexer degrades the sharpness of rising of the drive waveform, giving rise to a waveform distortion, under the influence of which the displayed image tends to become uneven in brightness. Assuming that only the picture cells P41,P51 and P61 are turned on as shown in Fig. 1 at the ter mination of the scanning for one frame, the mechanism of uneven brightness generation will now be analyzed. To this end, four regions occupied by picture cells are considered in accordance with turn on or off state of the picture cells as below A a turn on state region B a turn off state region above the turn on state region C a turn off state region on the right of the turn on state region and D a turn off state region at upper right of the turn on state region. When the picture cells P61, Pull, P62 andP12 are representing the regions A , B , C and D respectively defined as above, the picture cells Pull, P12 and P62 ought to be at the same brighness.However, when the aforementioned wafveform distortion occurs, those picture cells are subjected to different brightness, which renders the displayed pattern indistinct. Experiments and analysis conducted by the present inventors showed that the picture cells P12 andP62 are substantially at the same brightness whereas the picture cells P11 and P12 are subjected to uneven brightness. Then, the difference in brightness occurring between the picture cells P11 and P12 will be described in detail. With reference to Fig. 4 showing an electrical equivalent circuit of the display device of Fig. 1, liquid crystal loads such as the picture cells Pull, P12,P61 and P62 are represented by electrostatic capacitances Cll C12 C61 and C62, and the multiplexers 5 and 7 are represented by pulse generators each having an internal resistance RXl or RY1 indicative of onresistance of the electronic switches SX11 and SX12 orSyll and Syl2 included in the multiplexer 5 or 7. The electronic switches SX2i and Sy2j included in the multiplexers 6 and 8 are also connected in series with their on resistances RX2 and RY2. The waveform distortion is due to voltage drops across these on resistancesRX1, RX2, RY1 and RY2. Thus, uneven brightness will be described which is caused by the generation of the waveform distortion due to the on resistances RXl, RX2, RY1 andRY2. 1 Influence by Ryl It is now assumed that in Fig. 4, only the onresistance Ryl is finite with all of the other onresistances being zero, and influence of the onresistance RY1 will be analyzed. Either selection signal YS or non selection signal YNS is selected by the electronic switches Sy2j j l, 2, , 9 included in the multiplexer 8 and applied to the signal electrode Yj. Then, both the selection signal Y5 and the non selection signal YNS are subjected to waveform distortion. Especially, problems arise when the number of selections of the signal Y5 applied to the signal electrodes Y. is larger than 3 the number of selections of the signal YNS applied to the remaining signal electrodes Y., or vice versa. 3 For example, where as in a display pattern ofFig. 1 the selection signal Ys is applied to one signal electrode Y1 at the most the electronic switch Sy2j of the multiplexer 8 is transferred to receive the signal Y5 and the non selection signal YNS is applied to the eight signal electrodes Y2 ro Y9 100 or more signal electrodes in an actual display device , current flowing through the on resistance Ryl of the electronic switch Sy12 included in the multiplexer 7 is eight times as large as current flowing through the on resistanceRY1 of the electronic switch Syll. consequently, the influence of the voltage drop across the on resistance of of the electronic switch Syl2 becomes predominant so that the waveform distortion of the non selection signal YNS becomes larger than that of the selection signal YS and it may be considered that the generation of waveform distortion prevails substantially in the non selection signal YNS alone. Fig. 5 shows voltage waveforms VPll andVp121 applied to the picture cells P11 and P12 when the waveform distortion under the influence of the onresistance Ryl is taken into consideration. These voltages have the same waveform during the periods T1 through T3 since both the column electrodes Y1 and Y2 are applied with the non selection signalYNS In contrast, during the periods T4 through T6, the voltage waveform VPll is freed from distortion since the signal electrode Y1 is applied with the selection signal YS whereas the signal electrode Y2 is applied with the non selection signal YNS with the result that the rising of the voltage waveform VPl21 is degraded. In consequence, the effective value of voltage applied to the picture cell P12 becomes smaller than that of voltage applied to the picture cell P12 by an amount equivalent to the degraded rising, resulting in increased darkness. 2 Influence of The influence of the on resistance Yy2 will now be described on the assumption that in Fig. 4, only the on resistance Ry2 is finite and the other resistances are zero. In this case, the selection signal Y5 and the non selection signal YNS stand for signals fed from constant voltage sources and they will not be distorted.Similarly, the scanning electrodes X. are brought into connection with constant voltage sources and their voltage waveforms VXi are free from distortion. The voltage waveforms VYj for the signal electordes Yj are distorted under the influence of the resistance RY2, and individual signal electrodes Yj, which are independent and do not interfere with each other, undergo the degradation of rising to the same extent. Thus, all the picture cells are darkened uniformly under the influence of the on resistance RY2 and no uneven brightness will occur. 3 Influence of RXl The influence of the on resistance RXl will now be described on the assumption that in Fig. 4, only the on resistance RX1 is finite and the other resistances are zero. Fig. 6 shows voltage waveforms Vp1111 and Vpl2 applied to the picture cells P11 and P12 when the waveform distortion under the influence of the onresistance RXl is taken into consideration. Any of the scanning electrodes X. is applied with the selection signal XS once per one frame scanning. The scanning electrode X1, for example, is applied with the selection signal X5 during only the period T1 but it is applied with the non selection signal XNs during the periods T2 through T6 as shown inFig. 2. Current flowing through the on resistanceRXl of the electronic switch SX12 included in the multiplexer 5 is always five times as large as current flowing through the on resistance RXl of the electronic switch SX11 and as described previously, the waveform distortion of the non selection signal XNs becomes larger than that of the selection signal Xs and it may be considered that the generation of waveform distortion prevails substantially in the non selection signal XNs alone.This is more eminent in actual devices in which the number of the scanning electrodes is often larger. Thus, with reference to Fig. 6, the scanning electrode X1 is applied with the selection signal X5 during the period T1 and the waveform distortion will not occur. The voltage waveforms VPlI and Vpl2 applied to the picture cells P11 and P12 are free from the waveform distortion during the period T1 but subjected to the waveform distortion during the periodsT2 through T6. During the periods T2 and T3, the picture cells P11 and P12 are applied with the same waveform. During the periods T4 through T6, the signal electrode Y1 is applied with the selection signal YS and the signal electrode Y2 with the non selection signalYNS At this time, since the voltages Vy2 to Vyg applied to the signal electrodes Y2 to Y9 have the same waveform and the non selection signal iS is always applied to five of the six scanning electrodes, an equivalent circuit as shown in Fig. 7 is obtained in respect of the non selection signal iS Currents flowing to the five scanning electrodes are totalized into a current IX1 and a voltage drop AVxl IX1 RX1 across the on resistance RXl due to the current IX1 causes waveform distortion.But capacitances associated with the picture cells P12 to P19 are totalized and eight times as large as the capacitance associated with the picture cell P11 and hence the majority of current IX1 flows to the picture cellsP12 to P19 so that the picture cell P11 is not affected by the current IX1. As a result, the picture cellP12 is applied with the voltage VP11 which is distorted by the voltage drop AVXl not only during the periods T2 and T3 but also during the periods T4 through T6 whereas the picture cell P11 is applied with the voltage Vpl21 added with the voltage drop AVXl during the periods T4 through T6.Thus, the effective values of the voltages VP1111 and VP12 become different from each other and the brightness of the picture cell P11 becomes different from that of the picture cell P12. 4 Influence of RX2 Lastly, the influence of the on resistanceRX2 will be described on the assumption that in Fig. 4, only the on resistance RX2 is finite and the other resistances are zero. In this case, the voltage waveforms Vxi applied to the scanning electrodes are subjected to waveform distortion. Fig. 8 shows voltage waveform Vpll and applied to the picture cells P11 and P12 when the waveform distortion under the influence of the onresistance RX2 is taken into consideration, and Fig. 9 shows an equivalent circuit in respect of the scanning electrode X1. Voltage waveforms Vyl to Vyg applied to the signal electrodes Y1 to Yg and the selection signalXS and non selection signal XNs are considered to be outputs from a constant voltage source. Since the on resistance RX2 in Fig. 9 substitutes for the on resistance RXl in Fig. 7, the voltage waveforms applied to the picture cells P11 and P12 as shown in Fig. 8 are the same as those shown in Fig. 6, excepting that the voltage waveforms Vpll and Vpl2 applied to the picture cells P11 and P12 are distorted under the influence of the on resistanceRX2 during the period T1. As will be seen from Fig. 8, the on resistanceRX2 makes the effective values of the voltagesVP11 AND Vp12 different and the picture cellP11 becomes more bright. The influences of the on resistances RX1, RX2,RY1 and RY2 upon the generation of uneven brightness in the pattern display of Fig. 1 as described above will be summarized in the following Table.

In order to prevent the uneven brightness, it is necessary that the on resistances Ryl RY2 RX1 andRX2 be sufficiently small. Taking a display panel having picture cells arranged in 32 rows X 640 columns, for instance, the present Inventors studies conditions for preventing the generation of uneven brightness to reach the results as below. RXl 4.7 Q RX2 150 RY1 1K 1 RY2 22 It has hitherto been strongly desired to integrate the drive circuit and reduce power consumption therein. The conventional device has, however, difficulties in satisfying the above desirability and reducing the on resistance RX1 through which a large current flows so that voltage drop across this onresistance can be negligible. The present invention contemplates elimination of the disadvantages set forth above and has for its object to provide a drive circuit for a display device which is easy to integrate and which can reduce power consumption and prevent uneven brightness of display. According to the invention, the above object can be accomplished by a display device comprising a scanning electrode drive circuit and a signal electrode parallel to independently receive each of the DC voltage signals and transmit it to the one electrode. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the display panel has a plurality of picture cells arranged in a matrix form as a whole, the one input one output switch is constituted by a complementary MOS transistor, the three or more kinds of DC voltage signals establish four voltage levels, and the display medium is liquid crystal. However, the present invention is by no means limited to such an embodiment. Other objects and features of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a prior art display device Figs. 2a and 2b show waveforms of voltages Vxi and Vyj applied to the scanning electrode Xi and signal electrode Y. shown in Fig. 1 3 Fig. 3 shows voltage waveforms applied to the picture cells P11 and P12 shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 4 is an electrical equivalent circuit of the display device of Fig. 1 Fig. 5 shows waveforms subjected to distortion under the influence of the on resistance RYl shown inFig. 4 Fig. 6 shows waveforms subjected to distortion under the influence of the on resistance RX1 Fig. 7 is an electrical equivalent circuit of the Fig. 1 display device in respect of non selection signal XNS on the assumption that only the on resistanceRXl is finite Fig. 8 shows waveforms subjected to distortion under the influence of the on resistance 2 Fig. 9 is an electrical equivalent circuit of the Fig. 1 display device in respect of the scanning electrode X1 on the assumption that only the onresistance RX2 is finite Fig. 10 is a schematic diagram showing a display device embodying the invention Fig. 11 is a circuit diagram useful in explaining the fundamental operation of the Fig. 10 display device Fig. 12 shows drive waveforms in Fig. 11 Fig. 13 is a circuit diagram showing an example of implementation of the Fig. 11 circuit Fig. 14 is a schematic diagram showing a second embodiment of the invention Fig. 15 is a schematic diagram showing a third embodiment of the invention and Fig. 16 shows drive waveforms in the Fig. 15 embodiment. The invention will now be described by way of example. Embodiment 1 A first embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. 10 in which like elements and the same elements as those in Fig. 1 are designated by the same reference characters. In Fig. 10, there are seem a scanning electrode drive circuit 11, a signal electrode drive circuit 12, a timing control circuit 13, and a multiplex matrix display panel 1 similar to that of Fig. 1. The scanning electrode drive circuit 11 and the signal electrode drive circuit 12 have each one stage of a plurality of four input one output electronic switches Sxi i l, 2, , 6 and 5Yj j l, 2, , 9 which are the same in number as the electrodes, and DC voltage signals V1, V2, V5 and V6 and V1, V3, V4 andV6 are directly coupled to the inputs of each of the electronic switches. Individual switches constituting the electronic switches SX1 and Syj are on off controlled by control signals fed from the timing control circuit 13.Actually, the control signals CSXim and CSyjm m l, 2, 3, 4 are assigned to the individual switches but in Fig. 10, each of the control signals are represented by a signal on a single line for simplicity of illustration. Fig. 11 is a fundamental diagram for explaining the invention and it shows a drive circuit adapted for driving one picture cell, for example, P11. The electronic switch SX1 includes a plurality of one input one output switches SXlm m l, 2, 3, 4 connected in parallel to independently receive, as input signals, the DC voltage signals V6, V5, V2 and V1.Similarly, the electronic switch Syl includes a plurality of one input one output switches Sylm m l, 2, 3, 4 connected in parallel to independently receive the DC voltage signals V6, V4, V3 and V1. Individual switches SXlm and SYlm are on off controlled by control signals CS Xlm and CSylm from the timing control circuit 13 as shown in Fig. 12. For example, considering the control signal CS Xlm for controlling an electronic switch SX1 as shown in Fig.12, only the switch SX11 is turned on by a control signal CS Xli during preceding half of the period T1 and the DC voltage signal V6 is transmitted through the electronic switch SX1 and applied, as an output signal Vxig to the scanning electrode X1. During succeeding half of the period T1, only the switch SX14 is turned on by a control signal CS Xl4 and the DC voltage V1 is applied to the scanning electrode X1. A similar operation follows. Also, an electronic switch Syl is operated in a similar manner. A display medium or liquid crystal 100 is driven by the difference between voltages applied to the scanning electrode X1 and the signal electrode Y1. If it is desired to display at brightness of halftone as in television display, the control signal CSyjm for the electronic switch 5Yj associated with the signal electrode Y. may be modulated in pulse width. 3 For example, as shown at dotted lines in Fig. 12, the pulse widths of the control signals CSyll and CSyl4 are narrowed during the periods T4 through T6 and the control signals CSyl2 and CSyl3 are generated during intervals corresponding to the narrowed pulse widths. The switches SXim and SYjm constituting the electronic switches Sxi and SYj may comprise known bipolar transistors PNP transistors, NPN transistors or field effect transistors junction type transistors, Pchannel MOS transistors, N channel MOS transistors, complementary MOS transistors . Exemplarily, the switches SXim and Syjm shown in Fig. 11 are constituted with complementary MOS transistors as shown in Fig. 13, in which the same elements as those in Fig. 11 are designated by the same reference characters. An N channel MOS transistor 202 and a Pchannel MOS transistor 203 are connected in parallel to form a current path of the switch SXlm or Sylm. Since voltage level of the control signal CS Xlm or CSylm applied to one of the transistors is invented by an inverter 201, both the transistors 202 and 203 are turned on when the control signal CS Xlm or CSylm is at a high potential for example, 5 V and turned off when the control signal CsXlm or CSylm is at a low potential for example, 0 zero V . As described above, in the present embodiment, the number of stages of the electronic switch can be reduced to one by using a plurality of four input one output electronic switches each having four one input one output switches connected in parallel for the scanning electrode drive circuit 11 and signal electrode drive circuit 12, thereby making zero the onresistances RXl and RYl in Fig. 4 and preventing the generation of uneven brightness under the influence of the on resistance RX1 and RY1. In other words, extensive reduction in the onresistances W and RY of the electronic switches SXi and 5Yj is not required. For example, the conditions for preventing the generation of uneven brightness in a display panel of the same number of picture cells as used for calculation of equation 1 , that is, arranged in a matrix of 32 rows X 640 columns are given as follows X 300 2 Y 15 k Accordingly, the prsent embodiment can readily materialize resistance values which substantially prevent the generation of uneven brightness, and disperse with the conventional switches of low resistances of several ohms, thus making it easy to realize circuit integration. Embodiment 2 Fig. 14 shows a second embodiment of the invention. In the figure, like elements and the same elements as those in Fig. 1 are designated by the same reference characters. In this embodiment, a scanning electrode drive circuit 11 has one stage of a plurality of four input one output electronic switches Sxi i l, 2, , 6 each associated with one scanning electrode and including four one input one output switches connected in parallel, and a signal electrode drive circuit 3 has, as in the prior art device shown in Fig. 1, two stage connection of two input one output electronic switchesSyll and Sy2j j l, 2, , 9 and of two input one output electronic switches Syl2 and Sy2j. Control signals CSxim m l, 2, 3, 4 , CSyll, CSyl2 and CS2j are fed from a timing control circuit 20. As described previously, the maximum current flows through the on resistance RXl shown in Fig. 1 and the uneven brightness is most liable to be caused by the on resistance RXl. Therefore, the provision of the four input one output electronic switches in the scanning electrode drive circuit 11 alone can attain effects comparable to those of the first embodiment. Embodiment 3 A third embodiment of the invention is shown as those of Fig. 10 are disignated by the same reference characters. Fig. 16 shows voltage waveforms Vxl and Vyl and control signals CSXlm and CSylm applied to the scanning electrode X1 and signal electrode Y1 constituting the picture cell P11. In Fig. 16,V1 1 1 a Vo Vc V2 1 aVo Vc V3 vc V41 aVo Vc and V l 1 V are held. The display device of this inven 5 ao tion is also operable with the drive waveforms as shown in Fig. 16. In this embodiment, a scanning electrode drive circuit 21 has one stage of a plurality of three input one output electronic switches SXi each including three one input one output switches SXim i l, 2, , 6 m l, 2, 3 , and a signal electrode drive circuit 22 has one stage of a plurality of two input one output electronic switches 5Yj each including two one input one output switches Syjn j l, 2, , 9 n l, 2 . Control signals CSXim and CSyjn for on off controlling the switches SXim and Syjn are fed from a timing control circuit 23. In this embodiment, the number of stages of the three input one output electronic switches included in the scanning electrode drive circuit 21 is also reduced to one for delivery of voltages VXi applied to the scanning electrodes Xi, thereby attaining effects Although in the first to third embodiments the input signal to the drive circuit is of three levels or four levels, an input signal of five or more levels may be applied to the present invention. The display medium may comprise other materials than liquid crystal, and the invention may also be applicable to such devices as for plasma display, electrochromic, electroluminescence and PLZT which undergo uneven brightness when operated with a drive circuit which is constituted with two stages of switch as in the conventional drive circuit. Further, the invention is in no way limited by configuration and arrangement of the picture cell and electrode included in the display panel. Namely, it is not always necessary that the picture cells be regularly arranged in matrix, and the picture cells may be arranged in any segmental forms so long as the scanning and signal electrodes are arranged in matrix. The configuration of the electrode is not limited to the rod shape but the electrode may be narrowed at portions at which the picture cells are not formed. Further, the scanning electrodes and the signal electrodes may be provided on one substrate, with signal electrodes opposing the scanning electrodes on the one substrate and scanning electrodes opposing the signal electrodes on the one substrate formed on the other substrate. Moreover, the invention is also applicable to a multiplex matrix system as disclosed in US patent No.4,233,602 wherein a plurality of scanning lines are scanned simultaneously so that the number of scanning lines or scanning electrodes can apparently be reduced. It will also be apprecited that the voltage signals applied to the scanning electrodes and signal electrodes may take other known waveforms than those used in the foregoing embodiments. As has been described, since according to the invention, one of at least three level DC voltage input signals is simultaneously selected and delivered out, the generation of uneven brightness of display can be prevented and accordingly, a high quality drive circuit for display devices can be obtained which is easy to integrate and is reduced in power consumption.
