# A process for the production of superconducting conductors entirely brazed to a stabilising sheath, and conductors obtained with this process.

## Abstract
A process is described for the production of supercon ducting conductors of the type comprising a plurality of filaments of an alloy containing niobium and titanium as base materials and a composite matrix of copper, aluminium or alloys or these elements, in which the filaments are disposed, and which serves to stabilise the superconductor the process includes at least a first phase of preparing a first superconductng conductor comprising the said filaments and a first matrix of copper, aluminium or alloys of these elements a second phase of preparing a strip of copper, aliminium or alloys of these elements of width substantially equal to the perimeter of the section of the said first superconducting conductor a third phase of depositing a layer of brazing material on the outer surface of the said first superconducting conductor and at least on one of the surfaces of the said strip a fourth phase of connecting the said first superconduct ing conductor with the said strip and for shaping the strip itself by plastic deformation about the conductor in such a way that this latter is completely surrounded by the strip a fifth phase of heat treatment of the assembly obtained in the preceding phases to cause fusion of the said brazing material and therefore connection by brazing between the said first superconducting conductor and the said strip surrounding it.
