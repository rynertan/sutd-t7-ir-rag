# A PROCESS OF REDUCING A WAFER SIZE

## Abstract
A process of reducing the size of a wafer is provided with out damaging the remaining wafer surface. A flat is cut on a partially fabricated wafer within the desired diameter of a re duced size wafer. The edges of the wafer are sandblasted to re duce the wafer s diameter to approximately the desired di ameter of the reduced size wafer. The reduced sized wafer is etched to repair wafer damage caused by the cutting and sand blasting steps.
