# Improvements relating to the lining of pipelines or passageways.

## Abstract
The invention provides for the light curing of a synthetic resin which is light curable, and is arranged as a layer upon the surface of a pipeline or passageway. The curing lamps are enabled to be pulled into the pipeline or passageway by virtue of inserting a tubular member into the passageway which is inflatable by fluid pressure so as to hold the resin layer in position. The lamps pass through the inflatable tubular member so that radiation therefrom will fall on the layer of resin and cure or initiate the cure of the same.
