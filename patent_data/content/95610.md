# Fuse holder.

## Abstract
A fuse holder and method for manufacturing thereof, the fuse holder having a can and a molded body to receive a fuse. The fuse holder has a first contact located at one end of the body to engage one end of the fuse. A cylindrical second contact having opposed J shaped slots is disposed near the other end of the body. Engaging the other end of the fuse is a connector having a pair of tabs receivable by the J shaped slots to form a conductive bayonet connection between the connector and the second contact. Protrusions on the connector slidably engage the second contact to maintain conductive contact therebetween, if the bayonet connection is broken. The fuse holder can be adapted by modifying the connector or by using an adaptor to accommodate shorter fuses. To manufacture the fuse holder, the first and second contacts are insert molded into the body.
