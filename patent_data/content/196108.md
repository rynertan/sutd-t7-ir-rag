# A LIVING THING NURTURING DEVICE A LIVING THING NURTURING DEVICE

## Abstract
A living thing nurturing device for nurturing plants absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen and funguses or fish absorbing oxygen and producing carbon dioxide by profitably utilizing oxygen and carbon dioxide produced by the living things as mentioned above. The device comprises a first air tight receptacle for nurturing plants and a second air tight receptacle for nurturing funguses. Air in the first air tight receptacle contain ing a sufficient amount of oxygen is supplied into the second air tight receptacle and air in the second air tight receptacle contain ing a sufficient amount of carbon dioxide is supplied into the first air tight receptacle. A water tank is installed in the first air tight receptacle and the temperature of water contained in the water tank is controlled at a value a little lower than the temperature suitable for nurturing the plants, and the air containing a sufficient amount of carbon dioxide emitted from the second air tight receptacle is supplied through the water tank into the first air tight receptacle. While another water tank is installed in the second air tight receptacle and the temperature of water contained in the another water tank is controlled at a value higher than the temperature suitable for nurturing the funguses, and the air containing a sufficient amount of oxygen emitted from the first air tight receptacle is supplied through the another water tank into the second air tight receptacle.
