# Aluminium or aluminium alloy reinforced by zirconia and process for the manufacture of this material.

## Abstract
A composition of matter consisting of aluminium or aluminium silicon alloy, such as LM 13, into which has been incorporated between 5 and 50 by volume of zirconia. The zirconia may be in the form of fibres or of powder. The addition of zirconia to the aluminium alloy reduces the thermal conductivity and coefficient of expansion, and provides a material which has, particularly at elevated temperatures above 300 C, improved mechanical properties such as tensile strength, compressive strength, hardness and elongation.
