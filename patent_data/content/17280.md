# Blended lamp.

## Abstract
In a blended lamp, an incandescent filament and a high pressure discharge tube are arranged electrically in series. According to the invention the filament 8 forms part of a halogen incandescent lamp 2 and the discharge tube contains a sodium amalgam which is very rich in mercury. A relatively high lumen per Watt value is thereby combined with an acceptable colour of the light.
