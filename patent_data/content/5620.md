# Bridged catharanthus alkaloid dimers, their preparation and formulations containing them.

## Abstract
Novel bridged vinca dimers are described, of the following formula R NH CH₂ CH₂ n X CH₂ n CH₂ NH R wherein each R is the same or different residue of an indole dihydroindole alkaloid of the general formula The compounds are useful pharmaceuticals especially as oncolytic agents. They are prepared by reacting the corresponding azide of an indole dihydronidole alkaloid with an appropriate diamine or triamine. Some of the intermediates employed in this preparation are novel, namely those having the structure R⁶ NH CH₂ CH₂
