## Description
The development of new or improved dosage forms and delivery means for physiologically active agents has been and will continue to be the subject of research for both existing and novel drugs. In too many instances a particular drug dosage provides for more drug than is actually required to produce an efficacious and safe therapeutic blood level free from side effects. The reasons for such theoretically excessive doses are many and include, inter alia, the mode of administration, the metabolism of the drug in the gastrointestinal tract, the absolute absorbtion bioavailability of the drugs and the situs of absorption. In another aspect the use of sustained release dosage forms and delivery means has increased to further both patient compliance and convenience. More recently, investigations respecting transdermal drug delivery systems have increased resulting in a number of commercially available products especially for the administration of nitroglycerine. These latter systems apparently provide the advantages inherent in sustained delivery dosage forms and avoid the problems of a drums rapid metabolism upon oral administration.At the same time gess drug, although equally efficacious therapeutically to a greater amount orally administered, is ingested or absorbed by the patient.Nevertheless, the feasibllity, the suceess and potential of such transdermal systems have heretofore been limited to drugs that are efficacious at lower dose levels and or have relatively limited water solubility. The explanation for such limitations arise from the formidable barrier provided by the external layer s of animal skin and membrane tissues and the limited body areas which are usefully available for application of such transdermal dosage forms. Various efforts have been pursued to expand the availability of transdermal delivery to more drugs and overcome the barrier presented by animal skin and membrane. Most such efforts, at least those employing transdermal drug delivery devices, have concentrated on increasing the diffusion of the drug from the device into and through the aforementioned barriers. Other efforts have been more specifically targeted at improving the permeability characteristics or percutaneous absorption capacity of the barrier itself. While some of these latter efforts have reportedly shown some success, the agents employed frequently have caused undesirable systemic side effects as well as tissue damage and irritation at the situs of application. Agents reported to act as penetration enhancers for transdermal drug delivery include dimethylsulfoxide, disclosed in US. Patent 3,551,554 combinations of sucrose fatty acid esters with a sulfoxide or phosphoric oxide, disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,896,238 3,952,099 and 4,046,886 and the 1substituted azacycloalkan 2 ones which are the subject of US. Patents 3,989,816 4,316,893 and 4,405,616. The present invention relates to compositions useful for the transdermal delivery of physiologically active agents to mammals. More particularly, this invention relates to compositions and methods which enhance the percutaneous transfer of topically applied, systemically active drugs and particularly such drugs which have aqueous solubility or which can be made water soluble by the use of derivatives, or in composition, through selection of appropriate pil , buffers, solvents and excipients. Thus the composition of this invention comprises at least one systemically active, water soluble or solubilizable drug, a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle in which the menthol is soluble. In a further aspect, the invention relates to a method for enhancing the transfer of physiologically active agents into and through mammalian skin and membranes. The method comprises topically applying or administering to substantially the same section of the mammalian skin or membrane an effective amount of a systemically active, water soluble or solubilizable drug, a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Still a further embodiment of this invention resides in a unit dosage form for transdermal delivery of physiologically active agents to mammals. The dosage form comprises an effective amount of a systemically active, water soluble or solubilizable drug comprised within at least one drug reservoir means a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol comprised within menthol delivery means menthol solubilizing means and securing means for attaching the dosage form to a mammal. Menthol is a secondary alcohol obtained naturally from peppermint or other mint oils or prepared synthetically.Menthol has many uses as an ingredient in various medicinal preparations due to its analgesic, local anaesthetic and counter irritant properties. It has now been found that menthol acts to enhance the percutaneous transfer of systemically active drugs in mammal. Thus, this invention provides a topical composition for the transdermal delivery of physiologically active agents to mammals, said composition comprising an effective amount of a systemically active, water soluble or solubilizable drug, a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle comprising at least one pharmaceutically acceptable solvent or solubilizer for said menthol. This invention also comprises a product for topical use containing an effective amount of a systemically active, water soluble or solubilizable drug useful in medicinal therapy, a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle comprising at least one pharmaceutically acceptable solvent or solubilizer for said menthol, as a combined preparation for sequential in any order or simultaneous use in said therapy. In this invention the effective amount of drug will mean that amount of drug needed to produce a therapeutic dose following its transdermal administration. That amount will vary, depending, among other factors, on the physiological effect desired, the frequency of administration, drug and intradermal metabolism, drug hal f life and the amount of menthol and perhaps other percutaneous transfer enhancers employed in the composition. As stated, a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol is comprised in the composition. This amount for most drugs, generally ranges from about 4 to about 16 per cent by weight of the composition. The composition of the invention will further include a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle containing at least one pharmaceutically acceptable solvent or solubilizer for said menthol. The vehicle in preferred compositions will also contain at least one pharmaceutically acceptable solvent which is a solvent or solubilizer for the drug. The respective solvents or solubilizers for the drug and menthol of this invention may be the same or different. In either case it is preferable that the solvents or solubilizers for each the drug and menthol, in the amounts employed, are at least partially soluble or miscible with each other. Most preferably, the solvents or solubilizers for each the drug and the menthol will, in the amounts employed, be wholly soluble or miscible with each other. The pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle may also contain other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients useful for formulating topical pharmaceutical compositions including buffers, neutralizing agents, pH modifiers, viscosity building or controlling agents, gel forming agents, emulsifiers, surfactants, polymers and the like. Examples of solvents or solubilizers which may comprise the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle of this invention include one or more of materials such as glycerin, propylene glycol, isopropanol, ethanol, a variety of polyethylene glycols, block copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glyeol, acetylated monoglycerides, lanolin, mineral oil, water, aqueous buffers and the like. The composition of this invention for application to mammalian skin or membrane may take various forms including creams, lotions, gels, ointments, suppositories, sprays, aerosols and the like. In another embodiment, the invention includes a method for treating mammals in need of treatment with systemically active agents by the transdermal administration of said agents sequentially or in combination with a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthoL The method is effected by topically administering to substantially the same section of mammalian skin or membrane an effective amount of a systemically active, water soluble or solubilizable drug, a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Thus, the method of the invention may also be employed as referred to hereinabove in a method for enhancing the transfer of physiologically active agents through mammalian skin and membranes.In either event the method may be realized through administration of the composition of the invention, a unit transdermal dosage form comprising the composition of the invention, or through sequential administration of the percutaneous transfer agent and drug of this invention via direct application to said mammal or via the unit transdermal dosage form of this invention comprising the same or different means for delivery of each of said percutaneous transfer agent and said drug. The unit dosage form of this invention as hereinbefore described comprises an effective amount of a systemically active water soluble or solubilizable drug comprised within at least one drug reservoir means. Said drug reservoir means may take various forms such as pads or sponges impregnated with drug, a polymeric matrix containingxthe drug or composition of the drug, a gel formulation or other formulation having some structural integrity of the drug, a composition or solution of the drug within a walled container permeable to the drug and available to the skin or membrane of the mammal, a multiplicity of distinct microreservoir compartments containing the drug or drug composition within or homogenously throughout each microreservoir, layers of reservoirs and multiple variants of any of these enumerated and other drug reservoir presentations. The unit dosage form, as with the other embodiments of this invention, further comprises a percutaneous transfer enhancing amount of menthol. In the unit dosage form, the menthol will be comprised within menthol delivery means which means can be selected from any of the described drug reservoir means, distinct menthol reservoir means and integral menthol reservoir means. Integral menthol reservoir means is defined to include the provision of the menthol together with the securing means, as for example in an adhesive layer. Menthol solubilizing means and securing means for attaching or maintaining contact of the dosage form to a mammal are also comprised by the unit dosage form of the invention The menthol solubilizing means comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle in which the menthol is soluble or solubilizable and which further is also either a solvent for the drug or is miscible with the drug or drug composition.Thus the menthol solubilizing means may be formulated with any of the menthol, the drug and or in a distinct reservoir or depot within the unit dosage of the invention, so long as the menthol is soluble or made soluble therein and the drug or drug composition is soluble or miscible therewith prior to transfer through the skin or membrane of the mammaL The securing means will be selected from adhesives, belts such as those with velcro fittings, elastic bands or such other devices which are capable of securely attaching the unit dosage to the mammalian subject. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples. In examples 1 4 in vitro percutaneous transfer tests with nude mouse skins were performed as follows A piece of freshly excised nude mouse skin was mounted across a 6 cm2 opening of a diffusion cell. The test formulation was first impregnated into lynch diameter circles of a thin non woven rayon fabric usually in amounts representing about 20 mg or more per cm2 of skin. The impregnated fabric was applied to the outside or epidermal side of the skin while the inside or tissue side of the skin was exposed to an aerated and stirred volume of Ringer s injection fluid maintained at about 370C. Samples were taken at intervals from the stirred solution and assayed for drug content. The calculated total amount of percutaneously transferred drug is expressed as mg drug per cm2 of exposed skin.

Formulation B was prepared according to methods described in U8. Patents 3,952,099 and 4,046,886. Two circles of nonwoven fabric were impregnated with each formulation designated Al, A2 and B1, B2 respectively and tested for percutaneous drug transfer across nude mouse skin.

The differenee was larger than the skitto skin variation seen in the duplicate runs. Example 2 Formulations containing conjugated estrogens were prepared. A purified and dried concentrate of Conjugated Equine Estrogens was used, which contained per gram, 324 mg of conjugated estrogens when assayed according to the methods specified in the XX. edition of the U.S. Pharmacopeia. The major components of this mixture of natural estrogens are sodium estrone sulfate about 54 , sodium equilin sulfate about 29 , and sodium dihydroequilin sulfate about 13 . The formulation ingredients, as given below in percentages by weight, were combined, then warmed and stirred to give hazy amber solutions.

The two menthol containing formulations, however, caused the transfer of large amounts of estrogens.All three of the major constituents penetrated the skin, in proportions essentially equal to thegoriginal mixture composition. Example 3 Formulations containing etodolac, 1.8 diethyl 1,3 ,4 ,9 tetrahydropyrano 3,4 t3 indolel acetic acid, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory, analgesic agent were prepared with and without 5 menthol in a glyceroVpropylene glycol vehicle. The agent, sparingly soluble in water, but solubilized by this vehicle demonstrated about a three fold increase in percutaneous transfer in the presence of menthoL In other experiments, wherein the aqueous solubility of the etodolac were increased via the employment of buffers and or alkalizing agents the enhancing effect of menthol was even more pronounced in the nude mouse skin studies. Example 4 Formulation containing 17 B estradiol a non water soluble estrogen in lipophilic vehicles with and without menthol demonstrated no significant differences in percutaneous transfer. However, when employing 17 ss estradiol3 sodium sulfate a water soluble derivative of said estrogen in hydrophilic vehicles, formulations containing menthol demonstrated significantly higher flux rates in the nude mouse skin studies. Example 5 In this experiment the following formulations with and without menthol were evaluated in male albino rats. weight percent A BPropranolol hydrochloride 18.02 17.98Glycerin 54.10 63.88Isopropanol 17.84 18.14Menthol 10.04 The above formulations were impregnated on circular, cotton matrix patches, each patch having a diameter of 3cm and containing 0.3g of test formulation. The patches were applied to a shaved area on the backs of the animals and covered secured with adhesive tape. Blood samples were obtained twice for each rat from ten rats in each of two treatment groups at different time points.
