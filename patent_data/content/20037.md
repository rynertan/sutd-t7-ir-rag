## Description
OIL SOLUBLE FRICTION REDUCINGADDITIVE, PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF, ANDLUBRICATING OIL OR FUEL COMPOSITION CONTAINING THE ADDITIVE This invention is in the field of lubricants and lubricant additives. More particularly, the invention deals with additives to lubricants especially for crankcase use for internal combustion engines, which provide a reduction of friction of the operating engine. In order to conserve energy, automobiles are now being engineered to give improved gasoline mileage compared to those in recent years. This effort is of great urgency in the United States in view of regulations which compel auto manufacturers to achieve prescribed gasoline mileage.These regulations are to conserve crude oil. In an effort to achieve the required mileage, new cars are being downsized and made much lighter. However, there are limits in this approach beyond which the cars will not accommodate a typical family. Another way to improve fuel mileage is to reduce engine friction. The present invention is concerned with this latter approach. The present invention utilizes the finding that a material which is an oil soluble, C aliphatic hydrocarbyl succinimideor succinamide provides a friction reducing effect where it is incorporated in lubricating oil.Preferably, the aliphatic hydrocarbon group is derived from a linear o olefin which has been isomerized to form a mixture of internal olefins. The additive can also be used in the engine fuel.A preferred embodiment of the invention is a lubricating oil composition containing a friction reducing amount of an additive selected from the group consisting of oil soluble aliphatic hydrocarbon substituted succinimide and succinamide and mixtures thereof wherein said hydrocarbon substituent contains about 12 to 36 carbon atoms. The aliphatic substituent on the succinic group can be any aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing about 12 to 36 carbon atoms including alkyl, alkenyl and polyunsaturated hydrocarbon groups. Examples of the above additives include n dodecynyl succinimide l methyltridecyl succinimide 2 ethyltetradecyl succinimide n hexadecenyl succinimide n octadecyl succinimide n octadecenyl succinimide l methyleicosyl succinimide n docosenyl succinimide 4 ethyltriacontyl succinimide n hexadecenyl succinimide n dodecenyl succinamide 2 ethyltetradecyl succinamide n octadecyl succinamide n octadecenyl succinamide. In a preferred embodiment the aliphatic hydrocarbon group is bonded to the succinic group at a secondary carbon atom. These compounds have the formula EMI2.1 wherein n is a small integer from 2 to about 4 and Z is the group EMI2.2 wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of branched and straight chain hydrocarbon groups containing 1 to about 34 carbon atoms such that the total number of carbon atoms in R1 and R2 is about 11 to 35.Examples of these additives are 1 ethyltetradecyl succinimide l methySpentadecenyl succinimide 1,2 dimethyl octadecenyl succinamide l methyl 3 ethyl dodecenyl succinimide l decyl 2 methyl dotriacontyl succinimide. In a highly preferred embodiment R1 and R2 are straight chain aliphatic hydrocarbon groups. These additives have improved solubility in lubricating oil.Examples of these additives are l methylpentadecyl succinimide l propyltridecenyl succinimide l pentyltridecenyl succinimide l tridecylpentadecenyl succinimide l tetradecyleicosenyl succinimide. The above highly preferred additives are preferably made from linear a olefins containing about 12 to 36 carbon atoms by isomerizing the a olefins to form a mixture of internal olefins and reacting this mixture of internal olefins with maleic acid, anhydride or ester forming an intermediate and reacting the intermediate with ammonia to form amide, imide, or mixtures thereof. Additives made from isomerized linear a olefins have greatly improved oil solubility compared with additives made with linear a olefins. Isomerization of the linear a olefin can be carried out using conventional methods. One suitable method is to heat the linear a olefin with an acidic catalyst. Especially useful acid catalysts are the sulfonated styrene divinylbenzene copolymers. Such catalysts are commercially available and are conventionally used as cation exchange resins. In the present method they are used in their acid form. Typical resins are Amberlyst 15, XN 1005 and XN 1010 registered trademarks available from Rohm and Haas Company. Use of such resins for isomerizing linear a olefins is described in U. S. 4,108,889, incorporated herein by reference. The method by which the present additives are made are illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 In a reaction vessel was placed 185 grams of octadecenyl succinic anhydride. This was melted by heating to 600 C. and NH3 was injected. An exothermic reaction proceeded raising the temperature to 1600 C. After the reaction ceased, the product was heated to 1800 C. under about 737 mm 29 in. Hg vacuum to remove volatiles. The product was octadecenyl succinimide.Example 2 In a reaction vessel was placed 1000 grams of linear a octadecene. To this was added 187 grams Amberlyst 15 5 percent moisture . The mixture was stirred under nitrogen and heated at 1200 C. for 3 hours. The isomerized product contained 3.6 weight percent olefin dimer and the balance was internal C18 olefin. The product was separated from the resin. In a second reaction vessel was placed 504 grams of the above isomerized C18 olefin and 300 ml heptane. The heptane was distilled out under vacuum to remove water.Then 2.4 grams of tri 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl mesitylene stabilizer was added. The mixture was heated under nitrogen to 2250 C. Then 160 grams of molten maleic anhydride was slowly added over a 2.5 hour period. The 0 mixture was stirred at 225 C. for two more hours and then unreacted maleic anhydride was distilled out by pulling vacuum to 762 mm 30 in. Hg while holding the reaction mixture at 2000 C. The product was principally secondary C 1 8 alkylene succinic anhydride. In a separate reaction vessel was placed 532.5 grams of the above isomerized octadecenyl succinic anhydrideThis was heated under nitrogen to 1650 C. and then ammonia was injected causing the temperature to rise to 1800 C. Ammonia injection was continued until exotherm stopped. 0The mixture was heated at 170 C. under vacuum to remove water yielding isomerized octadecenyl succinimide.Example 3 In a reaction vessel was placed 1005 grams of linear a eicosene and 187 grams of Amberlyst 15 5 percent moisture . The mixture was heated under nitrogen at 1100 0 to 125 C. for 6 hours. The product was internally un saturated eicosene containing 3.3 percent eicosene dimer. In a separate reaction vessel was placed 560 grams of the above isomerized eicosene and 200 ml heptane. The 0 heptane was distilled out to dry the eicosene. At 140 C., 3.1 grams of tri 3, 5 di tert butyl 4 hydrox benzyl mesi tylene stabilizer was added and the mixture heated to 2100C. Over a 2.5 hour period, 156.8 grams of maleic anhydride was added at about 2250 C. Following this, unreacted maleic 0 anhydride was distilled out under vacuum at 210 C. leaving isomerized eicosenyl succinic anhydride. In another reaction vessel was placed 570 grams of the above isomerized eicosenyl succinic anhydride. This 0 was heated to 160 C. and ammonia injection started. The temperature rose to 1750 C. Ammonia injection was continued 0 at 175 C. until the temperature dropped. Then 762 mm 30 in. Hg vacuum was slowly applied to distill out water and ammonia. Additional ammonia was injected to be sure no anhydride remained. There was no further reaction so this ammonia was stripped out at 762 mm 30 in. Hg vacuum at 1700 C. yielding isomerized eicosenyl succinimide. Example 4 In a reaction vessel was placed 1100 grams of linear C16 C18 olefin mixture. The olefin mixture was isomerized following the procedure in Example 3. In a separate vessel was placed 485 grams 2 moles of the above isomerized olefin. This was heated at 1000 C.under 30 inches Hg vacuum to remove water. To it was then added 2.4 grams tri 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzyl mesityle ne. The mixture was heated under nitrogen to 2250C. and then 152 grams of molten maleic anhydride was added over a 3 hour period. The mixture was stirred 30 minutes 0 at 225 C. and an additional 50 grams of maleic anhydride was added. This mixture was stirred 30 minutes at 2250 C.following which unreacted maleic anhydride was distilled 0 out at 200 C. under 762 mm 30 in. Hg vacuum. In a separate reaction vessel was placed 598 grams of the above isomerized C16 C18 alkenyl succinic anhydride. 0Ammonia injection was started at 140 C. raising the tem perature to 1450 C. Ammonia injection was continued at 0 130 C. until no further ammonia was adsorbed. The mix ture was then heated to 1800 C. to distill out water and ammonia yielding isomerized C16 C18 alkenyl succinimide. The additives are added to the lubricating oil in an amount which reduces the friction of the engine operating with the oil in the crankcase. A useful concentration is about 0.05 to 3 weight percent. A more preferred range is about 0.1 to 1.0 weight percent. From the above it can be seen that the present invention provides an improved crankcase lubricating oil.Accordingly, an embodiment of the invention is an improved motor oil composition formulated for use as a crankcase lubricant in an internal combustion engine wherein the improvement comprises including in the crankcase oil an amount sufficient to reduce fuel consumption of the engine of the friction reducing additive herein described. In a highly preferred embodiment such improved motor oil also contains an ashless dispersant and an alkaline earth metal salt of a petroleum sulfonic acid or an alkaryl sulfonic acid e.g., alkylbenzene sulònic acid . The additives can be used in mineral oil or in synthetic oils of viscosity suitable for use in the crankcase of an internal combustion engine. Crankcase lubricating oils have a viscosity up to about 80 SUS at 1000 C. 2100F. . Mineral oils include those of suitable viscosity refined from crude oil from all sources including Gulfcoast, midcontinent, Pennsylvania, California, Alaska and the like.Various standard refinery operations can be used in processing the mineral oil. Synthetic oil includes both hydrocarbon synthetic oil and synthetic esters. Useful synthetic hydrocarbon oils including liquid polymers of a olefins having the proper viscosity. Especially useful are the hydrogenated liquid oligomers of C6 12 a olefins such as a decene trimer.Likewise, alkylbenzenes of proper viscosity can be used, such as didodecylbenzene. Useful synthetic esters include the esters of both monocarboxylic acid and polycarboxylic acid as well as monohydroxy alkanols and polyols. Typical examples are didocecyl adipate, trimethylol propane tripelargonate, pentaerythritol tetracaproate, di 2 ethylhexyl adipate, dilauryl sebacate and the like. Complex esters prepared from mixtures of mono and dicarboxylic acid and monoand polyhydroxyl alkanols can also be used. Blends of mineral oil with synthetic oil are particularly useful. For example, blends of 5 to 25 weight percent hydrogenated a decene trimer with 75 to 95 weight percent 150 SUS 380 C. 1000 F. mineral oil results in an excellent lubricant. Likewise, blends of about 5 to 25 weight percent di 2 ethylhexyl adipate with mineral oil of proper viscosity results in a superior lubricating oil.Also blends of synthetic hydrocarbon oil with synthetic esters can be used. Blends of mineral oil with synthetic oil are especially useful when preparing low viscosity oil e.g., SAE 5W 20 since they permit these low viscosities without contributing excessive volatility. The more preferred lubricating oil compositions include zinc dihydrocarbyldithiophosphate ZDDP in combination with the present additives. Both zinc dialkyldithiophosphates and zinc dialkaryldithiophosphates as well as mixed alkyl aryl dithiophosphates can be used. Examples of alkyl type ZDDP are those in which the hydrocarbyl groups are a mixture of isobutyl and isoamyl alkyl groups. Zinc di nonylphenyl dithiophosphate is an example of an aryltype ZDDP. Good results are achieved using sufficient zinc dihydrocarbyldithiophosphate to provide about 0.01 to 0.5 weight percent zinc. A preferred concentration supplies about 0.05 to 0.3 weight percent zinc. Another additive used in the oil compositions are the alkaline earth metal petroleum sulfonate or alkaline earth metal alkaryl sulfonates. Examples of these are calcium petroleum sulfonates, magnesium petroleum sulfonates, barium alkaryl sulfonates, calcium alkaryl sulfonates or magnesium alkaryl sulfonates. Both the neutral and the overbased sulfonates having base numbers up to about 400 can be beneficially used. These are used in an amount to provide about 0.05 to 1.5 weight percent alkaline earth metal and more preferably about 0.1 to 1.0 weight percent. Viscosity index improvers can be included such as the polyalkylmethacrylate type or the ethylene propylene copolymer type. Likewise, styrene diene VI improvers can be used. Alkaline earth metal salts of phosphosulfurized polyisobutylene are useful. Preferred crankcase oils also contain an ashless dispersant such as the polyolefin succinamides and succinimides of polyethylene polyamines such as tetraethylenepentamine. The polyolefin succinic substituent is preferably a polyisobutene group having a molecular weight of from about 800 to 5,00Q. Such ashless dispersants are more fully described in U. S. 3,172,892 and U. S. 3,219,666 incorporated herein by reference. Other useful ashless dispersants include theMannich condensation products of polyolefin substituted phenols, formaldehyde and polyethylene polyamine. Preferably, the polyolefin phenol is a polyisobutylene substituted phenol in which the polyisobutylene group has a molecular weight of from about 800 to 5,000. The preferred polyethylene polyamine is tetraethylene pentamine. Such Mannich ashless dispersants are more fully descirbed in U. S.3,368,972 U. S. 3,413,347 U. S. 3,442,808 U. S.3,448,047 U.

S. 3 793,202 U. S. 3,798,165 U. S.3,798,247 and U. S. 3,803,039. The friction reducing additives of this invention are also useful in fuel compositions. Fuel injected or inducted into a combustion chamber wets the walls of the cylinder. Fuels containing a small amount of the present additive reduce the friction due to the piston rings sliding against the cylinder wall. The additives can be used in both diesel fuel and gasoline used to operate internal combustion engines.Fuels containing about 0.001 to 0.25 weight percent of the friction reducing additives can be used. Fuels used with the invention can contain any of the additives conventionally added to such fuels. In the case of gasoline it can include dyes, antioxidants, detergents, antiknocks e. g., tetraethyllead, methylcyclopentadienylmanganese tricarbonyl, rare earth metal chelates, methyl tert butylether and the like . In the case of diesel fuels the compositions can include pour point depressants, detergents, ignition improvers e.g., hexylnitrate and the like. Tests were conducted using a 1977 U. S. production auto mobile. These were shortened versions of the FederalCity EPA cycle. This is referred to as the 1THot 505 cycle. It consists of the first 3.6 miles 5.8 km of theFederal EPA City cycle started with a warmed up engine instead of a cold engine. The car with a fully formulated SE grade oil in its crankcase is operated on a chassis dynamometer for about one hour at about 88 kmlhr. 55 mph to stabilize oil temperature. It is then run through four consecutive Hot 505 cycles measuring fuel economy of the base oil. Results of the four cycles are averaged. Then one half of the base oil is drained from the crankcase and replaced with the same base oil containing a double dose of the test additive. The car is then run at about 88 km hr. 55 mph for about one hour to again stabilize temperature.A second series of four consecutive Hot 505 cycles is run to measure initial fuel economy of the base oil containing the test additive. The car is then run about 805 km 500 miles at constant speed of about 88 km hr. i55 mph . Then a third series of four consecutive Hot 505 cycles are run to measure fuel economy after about 805 km 500 miles operation on the oil containing the test additive. The crankcase is then drained hot and filled with flushing oil which is run for a short time and then drained. The crankcase is then filled with the base oil which is run for a short time and then drained. The crankcase is then filled a second time with a base oil. This is run about one hour at about 88 km hr. 55 mph to a stable temperature. Then a fourth series of four consecutive Hot 505 cycles are run measuring fuel economy. This gives a second base line thus bracketing the test carried out with the friction additive between two base line tests. The following table shows the percent improvement in fuel economy over the base oil obtained using 1 weight percent of the friction reducing additive.
