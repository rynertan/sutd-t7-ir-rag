# Apparatus for applying heat shrinkable tubing.

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 draws a continuous length of shrink tubing 23 from a reel 22 cuts off a section 6 , and advances it onto the terminated end 9 of a lead 5 carried by an adjacent conveyor 40 . This is accomplished by shear blades 94, 95 integral with jaws 86, 88 which close on the end of the tubing 23 to sever a section 6 and contain it and shape it between the jaws 86, 88 . The jaws 86, 88 move vertically in a plate 85 which is then advanced horizontally toward the lead 5 . A feed clamp 102 which descends with the jaws 86, 88 draws the continuous length 23 forward, then releases vertically as the jaws 86, 88 depart and a stationary clamp 11 grips the tubing while the jaws 86, 88 and clamp 102 return over the tubing 23 for the next shearing and advance operation. Above motions are effected by levers 66, 74, 78, 82 and a slide 127 driven by followers 145, 141, 143, 147, 139 riding in cam grooves 144, 140, 142, 146, 138 on discs 70, 73 carried by a single shaft 71 . The end of the lead 5 with tubing section 6 thereon is transported laterally through a hot air duct 34 type heater having slots 36, 37 which permit passage of the lead 5 therethrough.
