## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING TERTIARY AMINES The present invention relates to a process for producing tertiary amines. More particularly, the invention relates to a process for producing tertiary amines of high purity and quality in high yield by reductively alkylating primary or secondary amines with hydrogen and a carbonyl compound in the presence of certain hydro genatinwg catalysts. Aliphatic otertiar y amines are useful as corrosion inhibitors and oil additives. They are also useful as intermediates for the production of quaternary ammonium salts and amphoteric surface active agents such as disinfectants, fungicides, sanitary agents, retarders in dyeing, and antistatic agents. As the use of aliphatic tertiary amines is expanding today, the requirements for their quality as intermediates are becoming increasingly stringen. Among other things, tertiary amines are required to have minimum levels of impurities that may impart undesired colors or smells to the final product. Various methods are known for methylating primary or secondary amines A methylation with formic acid and formaldehyde Organic Syntheses, Collective Volume 4, p. 723, John Wiley Sons, Inc. 1963 , B methylation with hydrogen and formaldehyde inorganic Syntheses, Vol. 4, p. 174, John Wiley Sons, Inc. 1963 .Higher alkyl methylamines may be produced by C reaction between higher alkyl halides and methylamine U.S.Patent 3,379,764 or D reductive amination between higher alcohols and methylamine Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 19604 1977, Japanese Patent PublicationNos. 849 1982 and 55704 1982 the symbol OPI as used herein means an unexamined published Japanese patent application . Conventionally, the higher alkyl dimethylamines are manufactured by method C , which involves a reaction that entirely differs from the one used in the process of the present invention. In method D , higher aldehyde produced by the dehydrogenation of a higher alcohol is reacted with methylamine. However, because of the high reaction temperatures involved and the high yield of by products, the quality of the tertiary amines produced by method D is very poor. Method A is unable to give a sufficient conversion of formaldehyde unless formic acid is used in large excess. Since formic acid is expensive, this method is not commercially useful except in the case of producing special tertiary amines. Method B uses the same type of reaction as is employed in the process of the present invention.This method has so far been considered unsuitable for implementation on an industrial scale because the reaction yield and the quality of the product are much inferior to those obtained in method C . However, researchers have made various efforts to improve this method since it has potentially a wide scope of applications, and an increase in the reaction yield and the product quality might render the method cost effective.An example of the studies made along this line is shown in Organic Reactions, Vol. 4, p. 244 and p. 248, JohnWiley Sons, Inc. 1948 . According to this paper, yields no higher than 90 were obtained when primary or secondary amines were reacted with hydrogen and formaldehyde in the presence of Raney nickel or platinum catalyst. United States Patent No. 3,136,819 shows a method for improving a yield by using an additional catalyst in the reaction such as a short chain monocarboxylic acid or a short chain hydroxy monocarboxylic acid. However, when a primary amine having an alkyl group of 8 or more carbon atoms was subjected to reaction in the presence of a Raney nickel catalyst, the reaction yield was low and the resulting product contained only about 85 of a tertiary amine. The present inventors have made detailed studies with respect to the alkylation of primary or secondary amines with hydrogen and a carbonyl compound, and obtained the following obserrations. When the primary or secondary amine is reacted with a carbonyl compound, l hydroxyalkylamineEMI4.1 is formed as an intermediate, and an imine CH N is also formed as a result of intramolecular dehydration. These are highly reactive compounds. However, if the reaction system has an insufficient reductive action, the hydrogenation of l hydroxyalkylazine or imine is unlikely to occur instead, they react with the primary or secondary amine present in a large amount in the reaction system, thereby forming an unstable polymer such as polyalkylenepolyamine which is deposited on the hydrogenation catalyst and inhibits the diffusion of the amine into the catalyst surface. In an extreme case, l hydroxyalkylamine or imine may also react with uSe active methylene group o the resulting polyalkylenepolyamine.The carbonyl compound may also react with this active methylene group.According to the finding of the present inventors, the carbonyl compound reacted with l hydroxyalkylamine as well as the polyalkylenepolyamine, and the resulting complex by products not only reduced the yield of the intended tertiary amine, but also cause a malodor, stain, and gradual coloration in the amine. Based on these observations, the present inventors made various studies with a view toward obtaining a hydrogenation catalyst that satisfied the following three requirements good dispersion in the amine layer reactive phase , high stability of the dispersion against moisture, and great hydrogenating ability. The present invention has been accomplished as a result of these studies. The present invention provides a process for producing a tertiary amine by alkylating an amine of formula I R1R2N CH2 I m wherein R1 represents a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having from 8 to 24 2 carbon atoms R and R3 each represents a hydrogen atom, or a linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having from 8 to 24 carbon atoms m is O or an integer of 1 to 5 and n is 2 or 3, provided that when m O, at least one of Rê and R represents a hydrogen atom with a carbonyl compound of formula II EMI6.1 wherein R4 and R5 each represents a hydrogen atom, a saturated or unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 24 total carbon atoms, an aromatic group substituted aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 24 or less total carbon atoms, or a substituted or unsubsti tuted aromatic hydrocarbon group having 24 or less total carbon atoms, or R4 and R5 may be combined together to form an aliphatic hydrocarbon ring. According to the present invention, a hydrogenation catalyst having from 0.1 to 10 wtt of at least one ofCo, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt supported on pulverized or granular carbon is provided in a reaction zone at the concentration of from 5 to 5,000 ppm of the catalyst metal based on the amount of the amine of formula I , and the reaction is performed at a temperature of from 80 to 2500C and a hydrogen pressure of at least 2 2 kg cm gauge while the carbonyl compound is continuously supplied to the reaction zone. Illustrative amines of formula I include octylamine, dodecylamine, tetradecylamine, hexadecylamine, octadecylamine, docosylamine, oleylamine, linolylamine, and erucylamine. Amine mixtures may also be used, including cocoalkyl amine, tallowalkyl amine, hydrogenated tallowalkyl amine, rapeseed oil alkylamine, dicocoalkyl amine, ditallowalkyl amine, dihydrogenated tallowalkyl amine, 2 aminoethyl cocoalkyl amine, 2 aminoethyl tallowalkyl amine, 3 aminopropyl cocoalkyl amine, 3 aminopropyl tallowalkyl amine, N,N dicocoalkyl ethylenediamine, N cocoalkyl N tallowaikyl ethylenediamine, N cocoalkyl diethylenetriamine, N tallowalkyl diethylenetriamine, N cocoalkyl dipropylenetriamine,N tallowalkyl dipropylenetriamine, N cocoalkyl tripropylenetetramine, N tallowalkyl tripropylenetetramine, N cocoalkyl tetrapropylenepentamine, N tallowalkyl tetrapropylene pentamine , N cocoalkyl pentapropylenehexamine, and Ntallowalkyl pentapropylenehexamine. These amines may be used either individually or in combination. Illustrative carbonyl compounds of formula II include saturated or unsaturated, linear, branched or cyclic aliphatic aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acet aldehyde, propanal, hexanal, 2 ethylhexanal, 2 hexenal, 2 nonenal andcyclohexylaldehyde aromatic group substituted aliphatic aldehydes such as phenylacetaldehyde and 3 phenylpropanal aromatic aldehydes such as benzaldehyde, o , m or p tolualdehyde, p methoxybenzaldehyde, pchlorobenzaldehyde and 1 naphthylaldehyde aliphatic ketones such as acetone, 3 pentanone and 2 decanone alicyclic ketones such as cyclopropanone and cyclohexanone and aromatic ketones such as acetophenone and benzophenone.These carbonyl compounds may be used either independently or in combination. The carbonyl compounds may be used as an aqueous solution or a non reactive soivent solution examples of the solvent including an alcohol e.g., methanol, ethanol , an ether e.g., tetrahydrofuran and a hydrocarbon e.g., hexane, cyclohexane , if desired. The carbonyl compound is used in an amount of from 1 to 1.5 mols, and preferably 1 to 1.05 mols, per mol of active hydrogen on the amino or imino group of a primary or secondary amine. If the amount of the carbonyl compound used is less than 1 mol per mol of the active hydrogen defined above, the primary or secondary amino remains unreacted in the final product. If the amount of the carbonyl group is more than 1.5 mols per mol of the active hydrogen, the process is not costeffective and an extra and prolonged step is required for removing the residual carbonyl compound by reduction. The hydrogenation catalyst used according to the present invention comprises from 0.1 to 10 wt ofNi, Co, Ru, Rh, Pd or Pt as supported on pulverized or granular carbon. Such a hydrogenation catalyst may be prepared by any conventional method, such as the one shown in Advances in Catalvsis, Vol. 20, p. 112 1969 . The hydrogenation catalyst is used in the present invention at the concentration of 5 to 5,000 ppm of the catalyst metal based on the amount of the starting amine.Even in a reaction system comprising both water and amine layers, the hydrogenation catalyst shown above is dispersed predominantly into the amine layer, and its dispersion into the aqueous layer is negligible. Alumina, silica, and diatomaceous earth are not desired as supports for the hydrogenation catalyst since they do not provide a good dispersion of the catalyst in the reaction system concerned. Metals and metal oxides such as Raney nickel, Raney cobalt, platinum oxide, platinum black, and palladium black are known as hydrogenation catalysts having an extremely high activity, but they do not provide good results in the reaction of the present invention. The process of the present invention uses an autoclave and performs the intended reaction at a hydrogen pressure of at least 2 kg cmê gauge , preferably from 5 to 50 Kg cmê gauge , and at a temperature of from 80 to 250 C, and preferably from 100 to 250 C.If the hydrogen pressure is less than 2 kg cmê gauge or if the reaction temperature is less than 800C, the desired hydrogenation does not proceed satisfactorily, and instead, by products such as l hydroxyafkylamine or its polymer and imine are formed in increasing amounts.If the reaction temperature. exceeds 2500C, by products such as a polyalkylamine and hydrocarbon are formed in increasing amounts due to the dehydrogenation of the starting amine. The carbonyl compound may be added by any method that permits its continuous or periodic addition.Usually, carbonyl compound is supplied in small portions into the reaction zone of a reactor by means of a compressor. If an aqueous solution of the carbonyl compound is likely to cause a great accumulation of water during the reaction, or if the reaction is expected to produce a large amount of water as a byproduct, hydrogen may be released or circulated so as to discharge water out of the system while the reaction is being carried out. An illustrative method for implementing the present invention is shown below. An autoclave equipped with a stirrer, a compressor, and an optional gas circulator with a cooling condenser is charged with the starting amine and a hydrogenation catalyst. The temperature in the autoclave is elevated to the desired level under stirring, and after the atmosphere of the reactor is replaced by hydrogen, an additional amount of hydrogen is supplied to a predetermined pressure. Subsequently, the carbonyl compound is fed into the autoclave under pressure, and the amine is reductively alkylated at the predetermined hydrogen pressure, When the removal of the accumulated water from the reaction system is desired to decrease the partial pressure of the water in the reaction system and to accelerate the reaction, a hydrogen gas circulator equipped with a cooling condenser is used to discharge the condensed water out of the system. After all of the carbonyl compound has been fed into the reactor, the reaction is continued for a given period while the temperature and hydrogen pressure are. held constant. If amine alkylation is performed by the method of the present invention, the intended reaction proceeds in a substantially quantitative manner and the formation of by products that may impair the quality of the end compound is negligible. Therefore, a crude tertiary amine product that is substantially colorless and odorless is obtained. The amine alkylation ratio is at least 97 Irrespective of the type of the starting primary or secondary amine. The distillation yield is 95 or more, and a tertiary amine having a purity of 98 or higher can be obtained. The tertiary amine produced by the method of the present inven tie is tighly stable against heat and light it withstands a heat resistance test at 500C and a daylight exposure test for at least 6 months without experiencing any change in color or smell. This tertiary amine can be used to prepare amine oxides and quaternary ammonium salts. All the products are substantially colorless and odorless and have no problems at all in appearance or quality. The advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by reading the following working examples and comparative examples. EXAMPLES 1 TO 17 An autoclave capacity 2 liters equipped with a turbine stirrer and a compressor was charged with a starting primary or secondary amine 800 g in Examples 1 to 9, and 400 g in Examples 10 to 17 and a hydrogena tion catalyst for its type, see Table 1 . The temperature in the autoclave was elevated to a predetermined level under agitation at 900 rpm with the turbine stirrer.The atmosphere of the autoclave was replaced by hydrogen, and an additional volume of hydrogen was supplied to a predetermined level. While a carbonyl compound was pumped into the autoclave over a predetermined period, the starting amine was reductively alkylated at a predetermined temperature and hydrogen pressure. After the completion of the addition of the carbonyl compound, the reaction was continued for 30 minutes. After completion of the reaction, the hydrogenation catalyst was filtered off and the aqueous layer was separated to obtain a crude tertiary amine.In some Examples, the crude tertiary amine was purified by vacuum distillation. The reaction conditions used in the respective Examples and the analytical values for the resulting products are shown in Table 1. As is clear from Table 1, all the crude tertiary amines obtained were substantially colorless APHA 30 .The purified tertiary amines were completely colorless and transparent. None of the purified and crude tertiary amines had a smell other than that of amines. The crude tertiary amines had a purity of at least 98 , whereas the purified tertiary amines were at least 99 pure. The purified tertiary amines were stored at 50 C for 6 months.They were also subjected to a daylight exposure test outdoors for 6 months. In either test, the amines experienced no change in appearance or smell.

EXAMPLE 41 A 2 liter conical flask was charged with 500 g of dodecylamine, which was heated to 700C under agitation.The flask was also charged with 219 g of 37 aqueous formaldehyde 0.5 mol per mol of the active hydrogen in dodecylamine that was added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes. After the addition of aqueous formaldehyde, the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at 900C, and thereafter, the aqueous layer was separated. An autoclave which was the same as used inExample 1 was charged with the condensation product of dodecylamine with formaldehyde, and a hydrogenation catalyst 5 Pd C 0.5 g, or 0.1 wtt for the starting amine i.e., 50 ppm of Pd based on the amount of starting amine . The mixture was heated at 1600C under agitation with the turbine stirrer at 900 rpm. After replacing the system atmosphere with hydrogen, an additional volume of hydrogen was supplied until the gauge pressure in the 2 reactor reached 10 kg cm . Hydrogen absorption began immediately after the supply of hydrogen, and its pressure was eld constant throughout the reaction. Two hours later, the hydrogen absorption ceased.Thereafter, 219 g of 37 aqueous formaldehyde 0.5 mol per mol of the active hydrogen in dodecylamine was pumped in over a period of 2 hours, while the hydrogen pressure was kept at 10 kg cm2G gauge . Under the same conditions, the reaction was continued for 1 hour. After the completion of the reaction, the hydrogenation catalyst was filtered off and the aqueous layer was separated to obtain a crude tertiary amine. This amine was substantially colorless APHA 30 . It did not have a smell other than that of amines. The purity of the crude product was 974 . The crude amine wa s purified by vacuum distillation. The distillation yield was 95.2 . The purified amine had a purity of 98.1 and was completely colorless APHA 10 . The purified tertiary amine was stored at SOOC for 6 months. It was also subjected to a daylight exposure test outdoors for 6 months. In either test, the amine experienced no change in appearance or smell. This experiment shows that a tertiary amine of good quality can be obtained in high yield even if part of the formaldehyde is first added and the remainder is continuously added in the subsequent hydrogenation reaction. EXAMPLE 42 A hydrogenation reaction was conducted as inExample 41. Dodecylamine 500 g was used as the starting amine. As a carbonyl compound, 60 aqueous acetaldehyde was added dropwise in an amount of 198 g 0.5 mol per mol of the active hydrogen in dodecylamine . In the subsequent reaction, the same amount of 60 aqueous acetaldehyde was pumped into the reaction system. The resulting crude tertiary amine was substantially colorless APHA 30 . It had no smell other than that of amines, and its purity was 97.7 . The crude product was purified by vacuum distillation. The distillation yield was 96.1 . The purified tertiary amine had a purity of 98.4 and was completely colorless APHA 10 and transparent. The purified tertiary amine was stored at 500C for 6 months. It was also subjected to a daylight exposure test outdoors for 6 months. In neither test did the amine undergo any change in appearance or smell. This experiment also shows that a tertiary amine of good quality can be obtained in high yield even if part of v ax Qyl compound is first added and the remainder is continuously added in the subsequent hydrogenation reaction. COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 TO 16 In Comparative Examples I to 9, the hydrogenation reaction was conducted as in Example 1, except that the amount of the starting amine used was 800 g Comparative Examples 1 to 5 or 400 g Comparative Examples 6 to 9 , and the catalyst used was Raney nickel Comparative Examples 1 and 6 , palladium black Comparative Examples 2 and 7 , platinum supported on silica ComparativeExamples 3 and 8 , palladium supported on diatomaceous earth Comparative Examples 4 and 9 , or platinum oxide Comparative Example 5 .

Tertiary amine value total amine value x 100.6 The samples were subjected to an organoleptic test consisting of 10 paneists, and those which were evalueted by at least 8 panelists as having a small other than that of amines were given the mark x . As is apparent from Table 3, the distillation yields and the purities of the product tertiary amines were lower than those obtained in Examples 1 to 42.The purified tertiary amines were colorless and transparent just after distillation, but upon standing at room temperature for 1 month, they acquired appreciable shades of color. This color staining proceeded further when the amines were left at 500C or exposed to a daylight exposure test. The amines produced in the ComparativeExamples smelled of carbonyl compounds or had other unpleasant odors just after distillation. The undesired odors became intense when they were left at 500C or subjected to a daylight exposure test. The results of Comparative Examples 1 to 9 show that catalysts outside the scope of the present invention do not give good result in reductive alkylation of amines. Data of Comparative Exampl es 10 to 14 show that the effectiveness of catalysts outside the scope of the present invention is not enhanced to the desired level even if hydrogen is circulated for removing water during the reaction. Comparative Examples 15 and 16 show that the carbonyl compound must be continuously added throughout thereductive alkylation reaction. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that.various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
