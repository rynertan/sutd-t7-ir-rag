# Digital luminance processing systems.

## Abstract
A first FIR filter 31,51 having a cosine transfer function receives the digital luminance signal. A second FIR filter 32,33,34,35,38,41,42 having a generally low pass frequency response receives the filtered luminance signals from the first FIR filter. A third FIR filter 33,35,36,37,39,40,43,44,45, 46,47 which includes a variable scaling circuit 47 respon sive to gain control signals 50 also receives the filtered luminance signals from the first FIR filter. The third FIR filter has a frequency response in which the relatively high frequency spectrum of the luminance signal is attenuated less than the relatively low frequency spectrum of the luminance signal. A combining means 48 combines the outputs of the second and third FIR Filter. The system is intended to provide a subjective improvement in sharpness and fine detail of a television picture.
