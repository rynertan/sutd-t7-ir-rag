# Method and apparatus for disintegration of solidified bath material on the residues of prebaked anodes from aluminium electrolysis cells.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for disintegration of solidified bath material on the residues of prebaked anodes, where the bath material is partially removed from the anode surface by core drilling which simultaneously initiates disintegration of the remaining bath layer. Drilling device, comprising one or more core drills 8 moved parallel to the anode surface between the anode rod s steel nipples 3 , is applied for disintegration of the bath layers.
