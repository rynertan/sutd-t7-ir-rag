# Process for producing a propylene block copolymer, and moulded articles of such a copolymer.

## Abstract
A process for producing a propylene block copolymer composition having an ethylene content ranging from 3 to 40 by weight and being greater than the weight of the rubbery propylene copolymer formed in stage II below, which comprises the following stages I and II I a first stage of polymerizing propylene containing 0 to 5 mole of another olefin in the presence of a catalyst composed of A a solid titanium catalyst component con sisting essentially of titanium, magnesium, halogen, and an electron donor, B an organoaluminium compound, and C an organic silicon compound having an Si O C bond or an Si N C bond to thereby form a crystalline propylene poly mer or copolymer and II a second stage of polymerizing propylene and ethyl ene, or propylene, ethylene and another olefin in the presence of the reaction product of the first stage and the same catalyst as used in the first stage to form a rubbery propylene copolymer and a crystalline ethylene polymer or copolymer.
