# SINGLE CHIP MICROCOMPUTER

## Abstract
A single chip microcomputer comprising an instruction decoder 1 and function circuit 2 such as ROM, RAM, ALU, or the like, is further provided with parallel input shift regis ter 4 or 12 , which receives data of output terminals C₁, C₂...C By means of direct testing of the instruction decoder 1 , the testing step is much simplified and testing time length is drastically shortened, thereby, production yield is im proved and manufacturing cost is decreased.
