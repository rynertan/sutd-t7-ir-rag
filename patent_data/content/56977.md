# Immune adsorbent, adsorbing device and blood purifying apparatus.

## Abstract
An adsorbing material for an autoantibody and or immune complexes is provided. The adsorbing material has an insoluble carrier and an organic low molecular weight compound containing a hydrophobic compound, which is fixed to the insoluble carrier. The adsorbing material may be used in an adsorbing device 1 , which has a vessel having fluid inlet 5 and outlet 7 openings with the adsorbing material 9 being contained in the vessel. The adsorbing device may be used in a blood purifying apparatus for adsorbing and removing an autoantibody and or immune complexes from blood plasma, which apparatus has a a plasma separating device and b a blood plasma mixing device, which are disposed in series in a blood circulation passage, and c a plasma purifying device comprising the adsorbing device disposed in a plasma recycle passage connected to the blood circulation passage to introduce plasma, separated in the plasma separating device, into the mixing device.
