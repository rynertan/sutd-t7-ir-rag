# Improved counter current crystallization process.

## Abstract
Continuous counter current multistage process for freeze concentration, including a step whereby the ice crystals in the first stage are separated from the mother liquor in a final separation step, the ice crystals being rejected and the mother liquor from the laste stage recovered as a product, whereby in a stage of said process ice crystals are introduced, said ice crystals having a larger medium size than the crystals in said stage formed without said introduction of said ice crystals.
