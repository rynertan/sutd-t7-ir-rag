The clutch comprises a cover member 11, a pressure plate 13 and a diaphragm spring 12 having an outer belville portion 14 and inwardly directed fingers 15. The diaphragm spring urges the pressure plate against driven plate 27 to provide a primary drive. The diaphragm spring is located on the cover member 11 by tabs 18 passing through mounting apertures 19 at roots of the fingers and bent over to hold the spring in position. A power take off drive member 29 incorporates tabs 34 engaged in the mounting apertures and bent over at 35 to locate the power take off drive member with respect to the cover.
