## Description
PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE AND A PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION The present invention is directed to a polyvalent vaccine for bacterial pneumonia. The vaccine comprises a plurality of capsular polysaccharides from different types of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Each capsular polysaccharide is prepared by growing the organism producing that capsular polysaccharide under controlled pH conditions and replenishing the glucose concentration during the fermentation. The pH is maintained at from about 6.2 to about 7.0 by addition of the required amount of an alkaline reagent such as, for example, NaHCO3, Na2CO3, NaOH, RHCO3, K2CO3, KOH, Mg OH 2, Ca OH 2 or A1 OH 3.Buffer solutions may also be used to control the pH but are less desirable because of the relatively large volume of buffer solution required. A lyophilized culture is conveniently used as the source of the organism.Following the fermentation, the polysaccharide is obtained by a two stage alcohol precipitation followed by removal of róteins and nucleic acids. In thej first alcohol precipitation, a predetermined quantity of water miscible alcohol is added to a liquid material containing the polysaccharide to precipitate impurities while retaining the poly saccharidz in solution. After removal of the precipitated impurities, a second. predetermined quantity of water miscible alcohol is added. The quantity. selected for this precipitation is sufficient to precipitate all or substantially all of the capsular. polysaccharide without precipitating a substantialy quantity of other material.The liquid material containing the polysaccharide may be a fermentation broth in which the desired type ofStreptococcus pneumoniae has been grown. While any water miscible alcohol may be used in the precipitation, preferably the alcohol will have from one to two carbon atoms. The precipitated polysaccharide is resuspended in liquid medium and treated to remove proteinaceous material Åand nucleic acids. This may be effected bi digesting the liquid medium containing the capsular polysaccharide with an enzyme such as trypsin or nucleases such as ribonuclease or deoxyribonuclease.Alternatively, the liquid material containing the capsular polysaccharide may be treated with a cationic surfactant such as cetrimonium bromide N,N,N Trimethyll hexadecanaminium bromide . If necessary, protein fragments, e.g., peptide and nucleic acid fragments may be removed, by appropriate treatment, e.g., by dialysis. The highly purified capsular sccharide of the desired type of Streptococcus pneumoniae is then recovered by precipitation with a water miscible alcohol. Preferably the alcohol is from 2 to 3 carbon atoms. The quantity of alcohol or cetrimonium.bromide required in the foregoing procedures is determined by a preliminary probe. Tk O milliliter portions, as many as there are fractions to be tested, of whole broth or other aqueous solution are is pensed into 16 X 25 in disposable culture tubes. The fractions to be investigated are usually taken at 5 E intervals over a range 10 15E bracketting the expected precipitation concentration experienced previously on a particular type. For example, if expected interval is 40 45E the following fractions should be examined 0 35E, 30 35t, 35 40E, 40 45E, 45 50E, and 50 55t. While agitating on a tube stirrer, alcohol is added to the lower level of each range. Agitation is necessary to avoid local overconcentration which will result in premature precipitation. All the tubes are centrifuged on a desk top clinical centrifuge 7 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant liquid is decanted into 16 X 125 ml tubes and alcohol is added, again with agitation, to the upper limit of each fraction. All pellets except the first which represents material in the 0 low limit of range are discarded. The tubes are again centrifuged for 10 minutes and the supernatant liquid is discarded. The pellets in each tube now represent material precipitated in the individual alcohol fractions. Each pellet is dispersed polysaccharide extracted in 2 ml of Dulbecco s PBS lx . The resulting suspension is cleared of insoluble matter with a Swinnex 25 filter Millipore mounted on a disposable syringe. A portion of the filtrate from each fraction is diluted 1 2 and 1 4 withPBS. The fractions are now ready for probing. Antiserum as supplied is initially diluted 1 10 with PBS lx , and a portion ca 1.2 ml of this further diluted 1 6.7 enough to evaluate all the fractions in a particular probe. In general, these dilutions hold. Bowever, an occasional lot of ant serum. has been found to be less potent and more concentrated dilutions have to be made. This cannot be predicted until experience with a particular lot is gained. 0.2 Ml of diluted antiserum is charged to a series of 10 X 75 ml disposable culture tubes three for each fraction interval. Each tube containing antiserum is charged with 10 1 for ethanol probes of the fractions to be pooled at the three concentrations as is, 1 2, 1 4 . 5,1 is used for isopropanol probes. The tubes are agitated and left to stand 15 minutes 1 hour. For convenience they are usually arranged in the following network. 0 30 30 35 35 40 40 45 45 5ú50 60 A lutec O O 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 A positive precipitin reaction is indicated by a distinct opaqueness or an actual precipitate. The desired polysaccharide may be split over two adjacent fractions, or over three fractions where the center one gives a more distinct precipitin reaction. Botch of these are positive tests and process alcohol or cetavlon fractionation range is selected based on these results. There is an optimum concentration for the precipitin reaction, and this is the reason for the the different dilutions. An excess of antibody may result in no precipitate, while an antigen excess often indicates positive results over a large range, sometimes with a weak reaction between two stronger ones. In this case the weak reaction is actually the strongest positive and this can be seen in the more dilute in antigen system. All Streptococcus pneumoniae type designations used in the present application are US type designations rather than Danish type designations. ATOC accession numbers for the various types are as follows Type ATCC Accession Number 1 6301 2 6302 3 6303 4 6304 6 6306 6308 9 6309 1G 6310 12 6312 1 6314 15 6315 17 6317 19 6319 20 6320 23 6323 25 6325 51 10351 10356 57 10357 72 10372 73 10373 A vaccine may be prepared by incorporating a purified capsular polysaccharide into a suitable physiologically acceptable medium such as, for example, saline, water for injection or phosphate buffered saline. Polyvalent vaccines may be prepared by incorporating two or more of the purified capsular polysaccharides into a suitable physiologically acceptable medium. A detailed description of the fermentation process for production of pneumococcal polysaccharide follows. k lyophilized L tube culture is suspended in 1 ml of Difco Heart Infusion Broth HIB broth and 0.2 ml is spread on a rabbit blood agar plate HIB . After approximately 18 hours incubation at 37 C, the growth on the plate is resuspended in 5 ml of HIB broth and 1 ml of the suspension is transferred into 100 ml of rabbit blood liquid medium and incubated as a stationary culture for 18 hours at 370C After incubation, the culture is examined microscopically and streaked on YED and HIB plates to check for purity. The 100 ml of culture is stored in a refrigerator at 4eC for a maximum of 1 week. Twenty ml of the foregoing culture is nosed to inoculate 1 liter of inoculum medium in a 2 literErlenmeyer flask with sidearm for addtion of sodium bicarbonate. The flask is incubated stationary at 370C until the specifications for the particular type are satisfied. The pH of the fermentation is controlled 6.2 7.0 by the addition of 128 sodium bicarbonate using phenol red in the medium as an indicator.A final sample is examined microscopically and an agglutination test performed to check purity and type.If the resulting culture is not used immediately, it may be stored for 3 4 hours at 40C. It is preferred, however, to use the culture immediately in the following step. One liter of the foregoing stage is used to inoculate a 14 liter fermentor containing 9 liters of seed medium. The batch is incubated at 370with mild agitation 100 rpm without air flow. The course of the fermentation is monitored by O.D., pH and glucose determinations. When a specific O.D. is reached, the batch is examined microscopically, an agglutination reaction performed, and a sample plated on YED and HIB plates to examine for purity. The pH is adjusted during fermentation 6.2 7.0 using 10e NaOH. If desired a portion of this culture may be used to inoculate a larger fermentor using the foregoing procedure. When the batch is terminated, the culture is plated on YED and NIB plates, examined Cr purity by Gram stain, and identified as to type b whe agglutination reaction. The broth is then inactivated by harvesting into liquefied phenol 89t to a final concentration of 19. After 2 hours in phenol, the broth released for recovery of product.

The crude polysaccharide is suspended in 90 ml of 3 sodium acetate. The pH is adjusted to 6.5 with glacial acetic acid and 65 mg MgSO4, 2.7 mg ribonuclease and 2.7 mg deoxyribonuclease are added. The solution is digested with agitation at 370 for 3 hours and cooled to 0 5 . A cetrimonium bromide probe is run on a sample of the liquid to determine the optimum cetavlon range of polysaccharide precipitation. Wjthj this lot the range is from 33 52 . With agitation 59 ml of a 1 aqueous cetrimonium bromide solution is added and the resulting mixture aged for 4 hours. The mixture is clarified in a K 2 ultracentrifuge at 25,000 30,000 rpm.

The liquid material containging the polysaccharide may be a fermentAtion broth in which the desired type of Streptococcus pneumoniae has been grown. While any water miscible alcohol may be used in the precipitation, preferably the alcohol will have from one to two carbon atoms. The precipitated polysaccharide is resuspended in liquid medium and treated to remove proteinaceous material and nucleic acids. This may be effected by digesting the liquid medium containing the capsular polysaccharide with an enzyme such as trypsin or neculeases such as ribonuclease or deoxyribonuclease. Alternatively, the liquid material containging the capsular polysaccharide may be treated with a cationic surfactant such as cetrimonium bromide N,N,N trimethyl l hexadecanaminium bromide . If necessary, protein fragments, e.g., peptides and nucleic acid fragments may be removed, by appropriate treatment, e.g., by dialysis. The highly purified capsular saccharide of the desired type of Streptococcus pneumoniae is then recovered by precipitation with a water miscible.alcohol. Preferably the alcohol is from 2 to 3 carbon atoms. The quantity of alcohol or cetrimonium bromide required in the foregoing procedures is determined by a preliminary probe.
