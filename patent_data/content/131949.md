## Description
PREPARATION OF HIGHLY ELASTOMERIC ETHYLENE ACRYLIC ESTER COPOLYMERS This invention relates to a process for modifying ethylene acrylic ester copolymers to make elastomeric products therefrom in a gas phase process. More particularly, this invention relates to a gas phase process for producing elastomers from ethylene acrylic ester copolymers which will contain carbon chlorine bonds. and. optionally. carbon SO2Cl bonds. High pressure ethylene acrylic ester copolymers have been treated with chlorination and other modifying agents in aqueous or solvent slurry or solution processes to provide products having improved mechanical and chemical properties. See in this regard for example. U.S. Patents 2.405.971 and 3.960,821. These chlorination type processes. however0 suffer the obvious disadvantages involved in the use of solvents. i.e., the need to completely remove the solvents from the products. and usually under vacuum and or elevated temperature conditions. These chlorination type processes may also require the use of elevated temperatures and or the use of relatively large sized reactors, to accommodate the volume of solvent employed. U.S. Patents 3,770,706 and 4.220.739 disclose the surface sulfonation of various ethylene copolymers with relatively low amounts of modifying agents. U.S. Patent 4,029,862 discloses the treatment of certain highly crystalline ethylene hydrocarbon polymers in a gas phase fluidized bed process with gaseous chlorine. The data disclosed in the examples of this patent indicate that the products produced by the process of this patent are also highly crystalline materials. and that. by extrapolation apparently, as noted in Figure 17. in order to obtain a level of crystallinity of below about 20 according to the teachings of this patent it would be necessary to add over about 55t by weight of chlorine to the ethylene polymers disclosed therein. None of such prior art procedures. however.disclose a solventless gas phase process for producing elastomeric ethylene acrylic ester copolymers, i.e.. those having a crystallinity of less than 10 and a modulus, at 25eC of less than 2000 psi. An object of the present invention is to provide a simple one step process whereby elastomeric ethylene acrylic ester copolymers containing relatively low amounts of sulfonyl chloride and or chlorine can be readily prepared from particulate ethylene acrylic ester copolymers with a minimum of reactants and under relatively mild reaction conditions. A further object of the present invention is to provide a simple one step process whereby elastomeric ethylene acrylic ester copolymers containing a relatively low amount of modifying agents such as chlorine can be prepared from particulate ethylene acrylic ester copolymers with a variety of treating agents. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a process whereby elastomeric sulfonyl chloride and or chlorine containing ethylene acrylic ester copolymers can be readily prepared without the need for post treating such polymers to remove solvent or catalyst residues therefrom. It has now been found that the objects of the present invention can be readily obtained if certain particulate copolymers of ethylene and acrylic esters are treated with certain chlorine containing modifying agents in a low pressure gas phase process as detailed below.Crystalline Ethylene CoPolymers The ethylene acrylic ester copolymers which are to be used in the process of the present invention are particulate materials formed from about 50 to 99. and preferably about 80 to 98.weight of ethylene and from about 1 to 50. and preferably about 2 to 20. weight t of one or more acrylic esters such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate. butyl acrylate. aethyl methacrylate. ethyl methacrylate. and the like. These polymers have a modulus value of about 2,000 to 20,000. and preferably of about 3.000 to 15.000, psi and a crystallinity of about 30 to 60, and preferably of about 20 to 40 . For use in the process of the present invention they should be in granular form. i.e., having a particle size in the range of about 150 to 1,000 microns. with the average particle size being about 700 100 microns.PROCESS The process of the present invention is a simple one step process which is conducted in the gas phase in the absence of solvents or liquid diluents. The preferred of such gas phase processes are the fluidized or agitated bed type processes. The process is conducted by treating or reacting the granular ethylene copolymers with a modifying agent which is adapted to being in the gaseous state under the operating conditions employed until the desired degree of treatment is achieved. The desired level of treatment is that which will cause sufficient amounts of the modifying agent to react with the ethylene copolymer as to result in the lowering of the crystallinity of such polymer to the level of less than 10 . and preferably. of the order of O to 4 . The modifying agents cause a lowering of the crystallinity. and thus of the modulus. of the starting polymer it is believed. by randomly replacing hydrogen atoms on the polymeric backbones with more bulky groups. C1 and 6O2Cl. The time required for this to occur will vary from about 3 to 10 hours depending. in part. on the particular modifying agent and or ethylene copolymer employed and the copolymer s particle size. Thus, the lower the crystallinity, and the smaller the particle size of the copolymer. the faster will the modification process proceed. The temperature to be used is in the range of about 50 to 1000C and the pressure to be used is in the range of from atmospheric pressure up to about 1000 psi.The pressure should also be one at which none of the reactants or by products will condense under the overall reaction condition scheme. The higher the pressure and temperature, the shorter will be the reaction time. if all the other conditions are the same. The modifying agents that may be used would include for chlorination C12 for chlorosulfonation SO2Cl2 or S02 plus C12 The process can be conducted without an initiator. If the use of an initiator is desired the preferred initiator is a azobisisobutyronitrile. As a result of the chlorination treatment, the chlorinated polymers vill contain carbon chlorine bonds randomly distributed throughout the backbone of the polymer. In such products the chlorine concentration will range between 5 to 55 weight , and preferably between 15 to 30 weight 8. As a result of the chlorosulfonation treatment, the backbone of the chlorosulfonated polymers will contain randomly distributed carbon chlorine bonds and carbon So2Cl bonds. In the chlorosulfonated polymers. the total chlorine concentration will range from about 5 to 55 weight 8, and preferably from about 15 to 30 weight 8, and the sulfur content will range from about 0.1 to 10 weight 8. and preferably from about0.5 to 5 weight 8. D 14007 The amount of the gaseous modifying agent to be used in the reactor relative to the amounts of the granular copolymers to be treated therewith is about 10 to 200, and preferably of about 20 to 100, weight . When S02 and C12 are used as the modifying agent the molar ratio of C12 to S02 to be used is about 5 1 to 10 1 and preferably about 5 1. About 10 to 50 volume of an inert gas such as nitrogen may be used in conjunction with the gaseous modifying agent. It has been found that after the modified.elastomeric copolymers are made in the process of the present invention it is much easier to remove any residual unreacted materials such as monomer or modifying agent. or HC1 by product. from the copolymer by merely flushing them out with an inert gas such as nitrogen. Since there are no components of the reaction system. other than monomer.modifying agent s . HC1 by product. and. optionally, inert gas, used in the process of the present invention. such as solvents. diluents, swelling agents. fluidizing agents. or catalysts. there is no need to expend any efforts to remove any materials of these latter types from the elastomeric product. The properties of the copolymers discussed herein were determined by the following test methods Crystallinity Heasured by Differential Scanning Calorimeter DSC using a DuPont 990 analyzer with pressure DSC cellTensile Modulus psi 1t secant modulus a film 4n x4 x 0.020 is compression molded at 130 150eC. and its modulus is measured according to ASTM 63S. Tensile Strength psi A similar film, prepared as described above for tensile modulus. is tested according to ASTM 638. s Elongation at Break A similar film, prepared as described above for tensile modulus and tensile strength, is elevated according to ASTh 638. The following Examples are provided to illustrate the process of the present intention and are not intended as a limitation upon the scope thereof. The ethylene acrylic ester copolymer used in the examples was a copolymer of 82 weight ethylene and 18 weight ethyl acrylate made with a free radical initiator under high pressure conditions. This copolymer was 32 crystalline, had a tensile modulus of 5,560 psi, a tensile strength of 2,300 psi, an elongation of 919S and was in the form of particles having an average particle size of 500 microns. APParatus Process The ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers were chlorinated or chlorosulfonated in a two liter glass lined stainless steel or Hastelloy 55Ni, 17Mo. 16Cr, 6Fe. 4W reactor equipped with a thermocouple thermometer and a motor activated U shaped Hastelloy stirrer. ,. A Hastelloy dip tube 2 cm in diameter was used to feed the gaseous modifying agent s into the reactor. Unreacted modifying agent and HC1 were vented to a collection trap containing 25 aqueousNaOh. The gaseous modifying agents were fed at the rate of 10 to 12 grams C12 per hour and 2 3g SO2 hour under a pressure of about 15 to 450 psi.The polymer to be treated. about 100 to 200 grams.was charged to the reactor and heated therein by an external heater. No catalysts were used in any of these experiments. After the polymer was added to the reactor and heated to the desired reaction temperature the resin was agitated by the stirrer and the gaseous modifying agent s were fed in. During the course of the modifying process samples of the modified resin were taken from the reactor to test for S and and or C1 content. and crystallinity. When the modification process had proceeded to the point where the crystallinity of the resin had reached less than about 10t the flow of gaseous modifying agent s was terminated and the product was alloved to cool in the reactor while being purged with nitrogen to remove S02 and or C1 and HC1. 2 Example 1 In this example the ethylene ethyl acrylate EEA copolymer was chlorinated at 700C for up to 10 hours. until it acquired a chlorine content of 21 weight .
