# BUILDING BOARDS AND SHEETS, PROCESS AND COMPOSITION FOR PRODUCING THEM

## Abstract
A board or sheet product having a density of at least 1300 Kg mlÂ³ is formed from a non asbestos composition comprising i an inorganic binder or the precursors there of in an amount of at least 75 of the composition on a dry weight basis, and ii from 2 to 25 , on the same basis, of cotton having a freeness of 20 80 Schopper Riegler . The cotton, which suitably comprises first cut linters, is preferably processed to a freeness of 25 40 S.R. The impact resistance of the products may be im proved by including in the initial mix synthetic organic fibres, e.g. polypropylene fibres.
