# Method and apparatus for controlling reduction ratio of continuously variable transmission with accelerator pedal displacement speed compensation.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus controls a reduction ratio of a continuously variable transmission of an automotive vehicle, wherein the reduction ratio is increased when the depression degree of the accelerator pedal is increased rapidly for ensuring quick acceleration. When the depression degree of the accelerator pedal is decreased rapidly, the reduction ratio is held for a predetermined period of time. Under this condition, the reduction ratio may be controlled to accomplish a predetermined deceleration.
