# Water borne hard coating compositions and processes therefor.

## Abstract
Thixotropic water reducible, dspersible, corrosion resis tant coating composition comprising amine salt of blended microcrystalline waxes in which the waxes have an acid number of 7 35 and the amine is preferable morpholine with C 8 30 carboxylic acid, preferably oleic, an overbased alka line earth sulfonate, e.g., SACI, and alcoholic coupling solvent, e.g., propyl glycol ether and water Tectyl 310 .
