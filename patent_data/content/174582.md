## Description
VENTILATION DEVICE POR MOTOR VEHIOS This invention relates to a ventilation device for motor vehicles, commonly referred to as air vents or ventilators, installable in the dashboard and or central console where the speed gear selector lever is situated, or at the ends of specially provided channels for directing ventilation air to the rear passengers. Air vents or ventilator devices are usually equipped, in a known manner, with flow directing means generally comprising two arrays of oscillable vanes mounted about mutually orthogonal axes and flow shat off and throttling members. At present, both the flow directing vanes and shutoff and throttling members are controlled directly by means of knobs which protrude from the ventilator bezel.The connection of each knob to its respective vane array and to the shut off and throttling member is sometimes direct, but more often for reasons of space and or positioning the aforesaid members, between each knob and the member controlled thereby there is interposed a kinematic deflector train. This complicates the ventilator construction with adverse effects from both the standpoint of costs and of reliability in operation. But the most important drawback is that direct adjustment may be inconvenient, and occasionally altogether impossible, such as when the only occupant of a car is the driver and the air vent s are located at the ends of the dashboard, thereby the ventilator located at the passenger side of the vehicle is out of the driver s reach. Accordingly, it is an aim of the present invention to obviate such drawbacks by providing a ventilation device which permits centralization of the air flow direction controls and the air flow throttling controls of all the ventilators installed in the passenger cornapartment Within this broad aim, it is an object of the invention to further provide a ventilation device which is simple, highly reliable in operation, and appropriate for fine adjustment of both the direction and rate of air flow. This aim, as well as this and other objects which will become apparant hereinafter, are achieved by a ventilation device including ventilator means which is characterized in that it comprises air flow throttling means and air flow direction control members subjectable to corresponding electromechanical control means, and a cluster of centralized switches adapted for at least selectively actuating said electromechanical means. Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed deacription with reference to the accompanying illustrative and not limitative drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a partly sectional perspective view of a pair of ventilator devices located on the dashboard of a motor vehicle, and of the centralized switch cluster Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view showing the construction of the electromechanical control weans and their related connection to the centralized switch cluster Figure 3 is a front elevation view of the centralized switch cluster in a modified construction embodiment Figure 4 is a sectional view taken along the lineIY IV of Figure 3 and Figure 5 is a sectional view taken along the lineV V of Figure 3. With reference to Figures 1 and 2, 10a and 70b designate ventilator means comprising for example, two ventilation air supply devices located centrally and at the ends of the dashboard 11 of a generic motor vehicle in a usual manner, at the inlet end of the vehicles air vents. Teach device, commonly referred to as ventilator, is formed of a small box like body 12, of generally parallelepipedon profile, wherein there are contained two sequentially arranged arrays of adjustable foils or vanes 13 14 pivotably mounted for reciprocal movement about mutually orthogonal axes a b the vanes 13 are adapted for controlling the direction of a flow of air passing through the ventilator in a horizontal plane, said vanes 13 define a length dimension substantially corresponding to an internal height dimension defined bZ said box like body 12, and are conventionally journalled at their extremities to the upper and lower internal faces thereof. The vanes 14 are adapted for controlling a flow of air passing through the ventilator in a vertical plane. Said vanes 14 define a length dimen sion cub tprtially corresponding to an internal width dimension defined by said box like body 12, and are conventionally journalled at their extremities to the lateral internal faces thereof.The vanes, in each array are interconnected, through hinge connections 13a provided substantially at the ends of rearwardly projecting protuber ances 13b, by a corresponding rod 15 extending transverse to the longitudinal extension of the vanes and which, so linked, may be displaced to provide consistent and simultaneous movement of all the vanes making up each array. On the bottom of the small box like body 12 there is provided an extension 12a to which the ventilation cold and or warm air supply channel is connected and in which there is provided an oscillatable throttling valve 16 for throttling and shutting off the delivery of said air. Advantageously, one vain in each of said arrays of vains is provided at an end thereof with an engageable shaft or pin 13c adapted for co operative keyed fit relationship with electromechanical means, as will be described hereinafter. Of course, the device does not compulsorily avail itself of a parallelepipedon profile and could have a different shape, e.g. a cylindrical shape, and be provided with a single pair of eave vanes adjustable in mutually orthogonal planes. According to this invention, control of the vane arrays 13 14 and of the throttling valve or vane 16 is centralized, it being implementable as a cluster of switches generally indicated at 17, which may be advantageously housed on the dashboard at an easily and conveniently accessible location for the vehicle driver and or the front passenger and also the rear passengers if located rearwardly on the known central console where the speed gear selector lever is fre quently situated. For this purpose, the vane array 13 14 and valve or vain 16 of each supply device are subjected to the action of a corresponding electromechanical control means, generally indicated at 20. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the electromechanical means include a gear wheel keyed to the shaft of the respective member to be controlled valve or vane in each array wherewith there cooperate a pair of diametrically opposed ratchet mechanisms each of which is subjected to a corresponding control electromagnet which, upon selective energization through the corresponding centralized switch, will cause the stepwise rotation in opposite directions of said gear wheel. The electromecanical means 20, which are identical to one another, are, of preference, as shown detailedly in Figure 2 the structure shown and described hereinafter being selected for reasons of low electric absorption of the medium, and for reasons of space requirements and necessary reliability in operation. For that purpose, each electromechanical means 20 comprises a container having a base 21 and a removable cover 22 connected to the base by screws. On the base 21 there is carried a rotatably mounted ratchet gear wheel 23 having, at a substantially central portion thereof, a profiled seat 24 adapted for accommodating, in keyed fit relationship therewith, the pin or shaft of the throttling valve 16 or said engsgeable pin 13c of a generic vane in the related array 13 14 which pin has a corresponding profile to prevent any mutual rota tional movement occurring between the pin 13c and the seat 24 the movement of the generic vane subjected to the control means being transferred consistently to the remaining vanes in the array through the related rod 15. Obviously, the container 21, 22 of the electromechanical means, may be mounted on a vehicle, adjacently to, but independently of the box like body 12 of the ventilator device through holes 24a being provided in the same to allow the pins associated with the valve 16 or the vanes 13,14, to be passed therethrough. Alter natively, the container 21,22 may be fixed to the box like body 12 by any suitable fixing means, such as rivets, screws etc., depending upon contingent assembly and installation requirements. With the gear wheel 23 there cooperate articulated ratchet pawls 26 27 which selectively engage with the wheel teeth at diametrically opposed locations so that said teeth are selectively operative to produce corresponding angular displacements of the wheel in opposite directions. The ratchet pawls 26 27 are articulated to the ends of stems 28 29 fast with the armature of corresponding control electromagnets 30 31 carried on the base 21 andbeing energized selectively through the centralized switch cluster 17. The cluster of centralized switches are provided with toggle change over switches for controlling the electromechanical members and a set of keys for controlling corresponding bistable switches for the selection of the different supply devices to be adjusted. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the cluster 17 comprises three toggle cha Qwer switches 40 41 42 arranged as shown in Figure 1, the middle switch 41 being adapted for controlling movement of the valve 16 to open and close or partially throttle a respective vent, and the laterally disposed switches being adapted for controlling movement of the cited vane arrays 13 14. Each change over switch has a stable open central position and two operative positions, respectively right and left ones, or up and down ones, into which it can be moved against the bias of elastic means. Above the change over switches there is the pushbutton row of bistable switches 43 44 45 46 serving to select the supply devices such as 10a 10b etc., which are to be adjusted, and hence, the number of bistable switches corresponding to the nunber of supply devices installed in the vehicle. The aforesaid switches selectively connect the wiring of the corresponding device to the centralized cluster 17. It may be appreciated that, from the electric standpoint, the wirings E1...E4 of the various supply devices such as 10ae10b etc. are advantageously in parallel with one another and are connected to the centralized cluster 17 by closing the related normally open switch 43 to 46.This circuit arrangement is advantageous because it enables simultaneous adjustment of two or more supply devices, e.g. to the effect of flow throttling. Of course, it would also be possible to actuate the switches 43a to 46 by means of a selective keyboard known per se, wherein closing of a key resalts in any already closed one being opened. Each switch may be provided with a light indicator Led 47 to indicate its activated or deactivated states.It is also advantageous that the bezel of the cluster 17 be provided with light indication strips 449 50 formed of a plurality of light sources Leds which are turned on sequentially to indicate the position assumed by the remote controlled members vanes and shut off valve . These light sources may be energized by movable contacts 51 carried on the ratchet wheel 23 of each control means which are progressively brought to contact a track 52 carried on the cover 22 said track forming the fixed contact. The toggle switches 40 41 42 activate a conventional pulse generator which through a power interface including, for example, a transistor with switching functions energizes correspondingly with pulses the electromagnet 30 or 31 selected by the change over switch itself. For each working position, each change over switch will cause, therefore, closing of the pulse generator circuit and closing of the circuit which selects the electromagnet for which the pulses are intended. The pulse generator and related interface are preferably housed in the centralized cluster 17 on a printed circuit board Wn a known manner, and not shown for reasons of clarity . The modified embodiment of Figure 3 relates to a different construction arrangement of the centralized switch cluster 17, tending to decrease its space requirements and improve the operating functionality thereof. In that embodiment, the cluster 17 comprises a central change over toggle switch 41 surrounded along four sides by change over switches 60 61 adapted for oscillation in the vertical and horizontal directions, as well as the series of the bistable selector switch 43 to 46. The change over switch 41 is used to control the shut off and throttling valve 16, whereas the change over switches 61 and 60 are used to control the array of vertical vanes 13 and horizontal vanes 14, respectively. The change over switches 60 61, hereinafter referred to as vertical and horizontal, comprise small frames 70a 70b tilting around corresponding pins 7172 against the force of bias springs such as 73a 73b.On the small frame 70a of the vertical change over switch there is formed a U like seat 74 containing the central change over switch 41 tilting around pins 75 of the seat against the force of a spring 76. The ends of the small frames 70a 70b and central changeover switch 41 are provided with movable electric contacts CX intended for engagement with corresponding fixed contacts of the centralized cluster board. Of course, within the inventive principle, the constructional details and embodiments may vary within broad limits with respect to all that has been described and illustrated by way of example and not of limitation, without departing from the scope of the invention. In particular, where the overall dimensions allow, the electromechanical control weans 20 including the electromagnets 30 31 may be replaced with continuous actuators equipped with reversible polarity motors having reduction gears which, through appropriate deflectors preferably of the worm and gear type, drive, with faculty for rotation in opposite directions, a gear wheel such as 23 keyed to the pin of the member to be adjusted.
