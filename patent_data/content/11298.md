# Diaphragm carburettor with rotary throttle valve.

## Abstract
An all position carburetor having an air fuel mixing pas sage with a rotary throttle valve 14 rotatably disposed in the carburetor body 12 across the mixing passage. The throttle valve has an opening therethrough to provide a venturi pas sage 26 in conjunction with the mixing passage. A by pass groove 30,32 is formed in the outer surface of the rotary valve 14 on the bearing surface 28 of the body to allow fuel which might otherwise accumulate in a pocket, in certain positions of the carburetor, to flow into the main air fuel mixture, thus avoiding overrich conditions when the car buretor is turned from one position to another.
