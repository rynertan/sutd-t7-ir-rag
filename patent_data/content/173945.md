# Integrated circuit device.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit device comprises combinational circuits and sequential circuits the sequential circuits each is provided with a common input control signal terminal 16 for controlling the permission to input main input terminal signals into the sequential circuit, a test data input output terminal 17 1,17 2 , a read write signal terminal 8 1,8 2,8 3,9 1,9 2,9 3 for controlling the transfer of the test data, and a latch circuit. The integrated circuit device is partitioned into sequential circuits groups 1 ,2 ,3 , and combinational circuit groups 4,5,6 used as partitioning test units, the main input output terminal groups of which are connected with the sequential circuits groups through wiring layers 11,13,15 , test data are written and read out, from and to the sequential circuits groups under control of read write signal lines through bus lines 17 1,17 2 dedicated to testing. Thus, a higher fault coverage ratio can be easily obtained with smaller number of steps and small test circuits areas.
