# Cleaning apparatus for a video unit.

## Abstract
A cleaning apparatus for a video player recorder video unit includes a cassette housing 8 which can substitute for a conventional video tape cassette and which includes a cleaning ribbon 9 wound on a pair of spools 10, 11 . The video unit includes a shut off mechanism of conventional type comprising a light source and first and second shut off devices 37,38 , the former being normally responsive to light through a clear leader at the end of the video tape to effect halting of the tape in the forward direction and automatic rewind, and the latter being normally responsive to light through a clear leader at the beginning of the video tape to effect halting of the tape in the reverse direction. The shut off mechanism is used by the cleaning apparatus to define a cleaning cycle, to which end the cassette housing 8 of the cleaning apparatus includes a shutter 34 which is rotatably driven by one of the spools 11 and surrounds the light source of the shut off mechanism. At the beginning of the cleaning cycle neither shut off device 37, 38 receives light from the source. During the cleaning cycle the shutter 34 is rotated by the spool 11 and at an intermediate point in the cycle an aperture 41 in the shutter 34 permits light to fall on the second shut off device 38 to inhibit automatic rewind. The cleaning cycle is complete when light falls on the first shut off device 37 through an aperture 40 in the shutter 34 , the light remaining on the second shut off device 38 .
