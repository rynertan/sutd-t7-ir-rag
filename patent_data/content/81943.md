# Anti fogging surgical mask.

## Abstract
Surgical masks comprising a a main body portion comprising a filter portion which comprises filter means divided into an upper region and a lower region, the lower region of the filter means being more permeable to air than the upper region of the filter means b means for providing an effective seal between the upper edge of the main body portion and the nose of the wearer c and means for securing the mask over the mouth and nose of the wearer. A preferred surgical mask comprises a filter means comprising two distinct filter webs of different permeabilities. These surgical masks function as effective filters to the passage of bacteria containing liquid droplets and may be suitably worn by eye glass clad operating room staff members since exhaled air, which could otherwise fog eyeglasses, is directed downward away from the eyes of the wearer of the mask. Furthermore, these surgical masks are comfortable to wear and may assume a comfortable, off the face or duck bill configuration.
