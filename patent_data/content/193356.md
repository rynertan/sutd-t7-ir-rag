# Method for analysis of subpopulations of blood cells.

## Abstract
A method for identifying and enumerating cells of a subclass of blood cells in relation to cells of another subclass of blood cells is provided. In the method a first subclass of blood cells is selectively tagged by incubating an aliquot of a blood sample with a first tagging agent. A second subclass of blood cells is selectively tagged by incubating the aliquot with a second tagging agent. The aliquot is then passed, without lysing of any subclasses of blood cells which are not of interest, substantially a cell at a time through an area of optical stimulation for the tagging agents. Light emitted by the tagging agents is detected, the detection being limited by gating to a threshold value related to a predetermined intensity of light by one of the tagging agents. Cells of the subclass are differentiated based on occurrence of emitted light from the tagging agents.
