# RATCHET AND TOOLS INCORPORATING A RATCHET

## Abstract
In order to provide a ratchet which can be made from inexpensive parts, it comprises a pair of discs 5 and 6 having ramps 5a, 6a upset from a peripheral zone of the discs and terminating in shoulders 5b, 6b . The discs are loaded together by a spring 9 which enables the drive to be transmitted via the faces of the ramps 5 and 6 up to a predetermined limit before the discs separate and the ratchet clicks over. In the opposite direction the drive is transmitted through the shoulders 5b, 6b , which may then be inclined to provide a torque limitation. The ratchet may for example be used in wheel braces as illustrated in Figure 1 or in spark plug spanners.
