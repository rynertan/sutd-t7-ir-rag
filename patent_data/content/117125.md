# Easily openable heat seal lid.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an easily openable heat seal lid for forming a heat sealed portion with a vessel proper for sealing the vessel proper, which is composed of a laminate comprising at least an inner surface member of a heat sealable resin, a metal foil and an outer protecting layer, wherein a score defining a portion to be opened is formed at a part of the lid more central than the peripheral portion to be heat sealed so that the score extends to the midway of the metal foil in the thickness direction from the outer side, a through hole piercing through the lid is formed on the inner side of the score in the vicinity of the opening initiating portion of the score, a rivet of an opening tab, which is composed of the inner surface member material and a heat sealable resin, is inserted through the hole to project to the inner surface side of the lid, the top end portion of said projecting of the rivet is expanded in the plane direction to secure the opening tab, the top end portion of the rivet projected on the inner surface side is sealed and engaged with the inner surface member by heat fusion bonding, and one end portion of the opening tab or the peripheral portion of the inner surface side of the rivet is substantially superimposed on the opening initiating portion of the score.
