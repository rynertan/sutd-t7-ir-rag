# Production of liquid hydrocarbon from gas containing lower hydrocarbon.

## Abstract
Liquid hydrocarbon is prepared with high efficiency from hydrocarbon gas containing C₂ C₅ paraffinic hydrocarbons and or C₂ C₅ olefinic hydrocarbons by bringing the gas into contact with a metallo silicate catalyst having the following chemical composition in mol
