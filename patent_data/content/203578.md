## Abstract
In a semiconductor device, a metal oxide single crystal film 13, 15 having at least one layered C rare earth crys talline structure is formed by epitaxial growth on a semicon ductor single crystal substrate 11 having a diamond struc ture or a cubic zincblende ZnS structure as its crystalline structure. Since the difference in thermal expansion coeffi cient is small between the semiconductor and the oxide, the thermal strain that develops in the semiconductor device can be reduced.
