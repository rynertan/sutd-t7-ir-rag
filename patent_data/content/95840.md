# A MECHANICAL ENGINE PROTECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A mechanical engine protection system 10 includes a temperature responsive valve 12 , a pressure sensing valve 14 and a mechanical shutdown actuator 16 . The valves and actuator are fluidly interconnected so that the actuator is shifted from a run position to a shutdown position upon the occurrence of a high engine operating tempera ture condition or a low oil pressure condition. The tempera ture responsive valve includes an inlet port 20 , an outlet port 22 and a drain port 24 . A valve element is positioned by a thermally responsive unit or motor 72 to selectively interconnect the outlet port with either the inlet port or the drain port. The pressure sensing valve includes an inlet port 20 , an outlet port 32 , a drain port 34 and a pilot port 28 . An expansible motor chamber 146 positions a valve ele ment 192 in response to the pressure signal applied to the control port to selectively interconnect the outlet port with the inlet port or the drain port. The shutdown actuator 16 includes an inlet port 38 , an actuator rod 18 and a spring loaded diaphragm motor 24 .
