# A glass window for a vehicle.

## Abstract
A glass window for a vehicle, particularly an automobile rear window has heater elements 2 extending between bus bars 3, 4 which are connected to terminals 5, 6 arranged close together near the periphery of the window, by leads 17, 19 which are fixed to a surface of the window and are sufficiently spaced from the window edge to reduce stray capacitance to a level such that a useable radio signal can be derived.
