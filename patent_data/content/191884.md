## Description
PROCESS FOR THE SINGLE STAGE PRODUCTION OF HIGHER ALIPHATIC KETONESThis invention relates to a new process for the production of higher aliphatic ketones from ketones of lower molecular weight.Processes for the production, for example, of methylisobutylketone from acetone are well known.This production is effected in three stages in the conventional process the first stage consists of the aldol condensation of the acetone I , catalysed by a base, to produce diacetone alcohol II EMI1.1 tb 2CH3 CO CH3 SEP base SEP CH SEP CH3 COH CH2 CO CH3 tb SEP 3 SEP 2 tb SEP CH3 tb SEP I SEP II tb the second stage consists of the removal of H20 catalysed in the liquid phase by H2SC 4 or H3P04, at a temperature of about 100 C to obtain mesityl oxide III EMI1.2 the third stage consists of the hydrogenation of the mesityl oxide at a temperature of 150 2000C and a pressure of 3 10 bars in the presence of copper or nickel catalysts, to produce methyl isobutylketone IV EMI1.3 In order to simplify this process, various methods have been proposed which attempt to reduce the three stages to a single stage by operating in the presence of suitably prepared catalysts for exampleFrench patent 2,056,450 Japanese patent 74 06,290 British patent 1,269,891 French patent 2,064,778 .The catalytic systems used in these single stage processes generally consist of one or more transition metals Ru, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt,Cu, Cr etc. dispersed on matrices able to catalyse the condensation of acetone to d , unsaturated ketones CaO, MgO, A1203, SiO2, TiO2,ZnO etc. .The reduction is conducted using gaseous hydrogen at a pressure of between 1 and 50 bars, and operating at a temperature of between 100 and 350 C. The results of the reaction in terms of selectivity vary considerably with the degree of acetone conversion, the reaction conditions d the catalytic system used. The best results have been obtained with a Pd Zr P catalytic system.We have now discovered a new process for the production of higher aliphatic ketones from ketones of lower molecular weight, operating in a single stage.The process according to the present invention is characterised in that the starting ketone is reacted in the presence of CO over a catalyst in the form of copper supported on a metal oxide.The process according to the present invention is further characterised in that the catalyst is prepared by precipitating, by hydrolysis, a cuprammonium complex on an oxide such as A1203, Si02, Ti02, ZrO2, MgO, ZnO, Cr203 etc., followed by calcining in air and reduction in a hydrogen stream.A further characteristic of the process according to the present invention is that the reaction can be conducted either in the liquid phase or in the gaseous phase.A possible theoretical interpretation of the phenomens which occur in the process of the present invention can be represented by the following scheme, which relates to the preparation of methylisobutylketone starting from acetone.EMI3.1 Overall, the process can be represented by the following reaction EMI3.2 The methylisobutylketone IV can further react to give ketones of higher molecular weight, for example it can react in accordance with the following reactions EMI3.3 In th1Cs manner, diisobutylketone V and 2,4,8 trimethylnonan 6 one VI are obtained.According t the sforesaid scheme, the hydrogen necessary for redu cing the alpha ,ss unsaturated ketones is produced in situ by the water gas conversion reaction catalysed by the copper dispersed on the catalyst surface reaction 3 .An advantage of the process according to the present invention is therefore the fact that the water produced in condensing the acetone to mesityl oxide reactions 1 and 2 is completely consumed in producing the hydrogen necessary for reducing the unsaturated ketone reaction 4 and this tends to further increase the degree of advancement of reaction 2.The catalyst for use in the process according to the present invention is preferably prepared by the following method, although other catalyst preparation methods can be used within the scope of the invention.An aqueous solution of a cuprammonium complex is prepared starting from Cu N03 2.3H20, CuSO4.1962O, Cu C104 2.6H20 or other copper salts, the solution having a Cu content of between 2 and 20 g l and preferably between 12 and 15 g l, and being stabilised with a slight excess of ammonia. Awl 203 is added to this solution in a quantity such as to obtain a weight ratio of Cu to Al2O3 of between 0.015 and 0.15, and preferably between 0.085 and 0.11, said Awl203 having the following characteristics crystalline structure type , particle size distribution between 50 and 150 llm 100 290 mesh ASTM , specific surface preferably between 150 and 200 m2 g.The suspension is diluted with distilled water until the copper concentration lies between 0.2 and 6 g l, and preferably between 0.9 and 1.2 g l.During the dilution, the suspension is kept under agitation 500 r.p.m. st a temperature preferably of between 10 and 30 C. By virtue of the dilution, the cuprammonium complex hydrolyses, and the hydrolysis product is deposited in a finely dispersed form on the surface of the A1203 particles.The solid is then filtered, after which it is washed three times with between 30 and 50 snl g of distilled water, the product then being calcined in air at a temperature of between 2500 and 400ÂµC for a time of between 1 and 10 hours, and preferably for a time of between 3 and 4 hours. The calcined product is then reduced in a hydrogen stream by forming the catalyst into a fixed bed and passing the hydrogen over it at a flow rate of between 1 and 100 ml min. The reduction temperature is kept constant at between 150 and 3500C. The reaction time is between 5 and 90 minutes, and preferably between 10 and 20 minutes.The catalyst thus obtained consists of Cu supported on Al203. TheCu content of the catalyst is between 5 and 10X, the particle size distribution is between 50 and 100 wn 100 290 mesh ASS , and the specific surface is between 200 and 250 m2 g. Other oxides can be used instead of the A1203 for the catalyst support, such as SiO2, TiO2, Zero2, MgO or ZnO. The reaction for producing higher ketones from acetone in the liquid phase is conducted in the following manner.The acetone and catalyst are fed into a metal reactor in an acetone Cu molar ratio of between 50 and 500 and preferably between 90 and 150.Carbon monoxide is then fed in until a pressure of between 0.5 and 80 bars and preferably between 15 and 40 bars is reached. The reactor is heated to a temperature of between l2O and 2200C and preferably between 140 and 2000C. The reaction is conducted for a time of between 0.25 and 15 hours and preferably between 0.5 and 4 hours.If the required product is methylisobutylketone, it is convenient to operate at the lower limits of the reaction pressure, temperature and time ranges, compatible with a reasonable level of acetone conversion, for example around 50 . At the higher limits of these ranges substantial quantities of diisobutylketone form at the expense of the methylisobutylketone.Tne reaction for producing higher ketones in the liquid phase from ketones other than acetone, for example from butan 2 one, from methylisobutylketone etc., is conducted in the same manner as described for acetone, but with the difference that the reaction time has to be increased, preferably up to 14 hours.When operating with butan 2 one, with a conversion exceeding 65 , 3 methylheptan 5 one can be obtained with a selectivity exceeding 90 . When operating with methylisobutylketone, with a conversion exceeding 85 , 2 4 8 thiomethylnonan 6 one can be obtained with a selectivity exceeding 90X. The process according to the present invention can also be conducted in the gaseous phase. In this case, the catalyst is fed into a tubular reactor which is heated to a temperature of between 1200 and 220 C and preferably between 1400 and 1800C h gaseous stream of carbon monoxide and ketone, preferably in a molar ratio close to 2 1, is passed through the reactor at a pressure slightly greater than atmospheric pressure.The results obtained by operating in the gaseous phase are analogous to those obtained by operating in the liquid phase.The following examples are given in order to illustrate the operational method and characteristics of the process according to the present invention.

The mixture thus obtained was diluted with 2 litr 9 of distilled water St 8 temperature of 25 C, maintaining energetic agitation 500 r.p.m. during the dilution, so as to cause hydrolysis of the cuprammonium complex and deposition of the hydrolysis product in finely dispersed form on the surface of the A1203 granules.The solid product was separated by filtration, washed with three portions of distilled water each of 1 litre volume, calcined in air at 350C for 180 minutes, and finally reduced in a hydrogen stream at 270doc for 15 minutes by forming it into a layer having a thickness of 1 cm and passing hydrogen over it at a throughput of 20 ml min.A catalyst was obtained constituted by Cu supported on A1203, containing 4.5X of Cu and in the form of particles of size distribution 50 150 prn 100 290 mesh ASTM , and with a specific surface of 260 m2 g..
