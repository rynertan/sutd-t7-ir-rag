# Novel thermostable, aciduric alpha amylase and method for its production.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an alpha amylase enzyme exhibiting thermostability at an acidic pH which is derived from a spore forming, thermophilic, anaerobic bacterium and to a process for its production. This alpha amylase is espe cially useful for the preparation of glucose containing syrups from starch.
