## Description
POLYPHENYLENE OXIDE COMPOSITION This invention relates to a polyphenylene oxide composition excellent in heat resistance, weather resistance and impact resistance, and more particularly to a composition excellent in heat resistance, weather resistance and impact resistance which comprises a polyphenylene oxide, b an alkenyl aromatic polymer modified with a diene rubber and c a copolymer produced by graft polymerizing an alkenyl aromatic monomer onto an ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer. Though polyphenylene oxide is a resin having excellent properties such as heat resistance, chemical resistance, mechanical properties, electrical properties, etc., it has faults such as poor moldability, low impact resistance, etc. As a method for overcoming these faults, there is known the blending of alkenyl aromatic polymer miscible with polyphenylene oxide into the latter for the purpose of improving its moldability and there is known the blending and dispersing of rubber for the purpose of improving its impact resistance. Particularly, the blending of alkenyl aromatic polymer modified with rubber is advantageous in that its moldability and impact resistance can be improved simultaneously.However, this alkenyl aromatic polymer modified with rubber usually contains a diene rubber as the rubber component, so that it has the fault that it rapidly becomes fragile when exposed to a high temperature or exposed to outdoor conditions for a long period of time, and the faultcreates a problem. In view of above, the present inventors conducted a study with the aim of improving heat resistance and weather resistance of a composition comprising polyphenylene oxide and an alkenyl aromatic polymer modified with diene rubber. As a result, it was found that its heat resistance can greatly be improved and that its impact resistance can also be improved greatly by adding thereto a copolymer produced by graft polymerizing an alkenyl aromatic monomer onto an ethylene aolefin polyene terpolymer. Based on this finding, this invention was achieved. It is an object of this invention to provide a novel polyphenylene oxide composition excellent in heat resistance, weather resistance and impact resistance. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the description given below. According to this invention, there is provided a polyphenylene oxide composition comprising a polyphenylene oxide, b an alkenyl aromatic polymer modified with a diene rubber and c a copolymer produced by graft copolymerizing an alkenyl aromatic monomer onto an ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer in which the ratio by weight of the ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer part to the part of the polymer of alkenyl aromatic monomer is in the range of 1 20 to 20 1, the ratio by weight of the component a to component b being in the range of 1 10 to 10 1, and the amount of the component c being 1 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the sum of the component a and component b . Next, the effect of this invention will be described. If a diene rubber is used in place of component c , impact resistance of the composition can be improved, but the impact resistance falls steeply when the composition is exposed to a high temperature due to deterioration of the diene rubber. If an ethylene aolefin polyene terpolymer which is not graft polymerized is used in place of component c , the drop in impact resistance due to deterioration ofArubber at high temperature can be overcome, but the effect in improving impact resistance is relatively small.Thus, a result whereby impact resistance is improved greatly and drop in impact resistance due to thermal deterioration at high temperature is quite small can be secured only by using a copolymer produced by graft polymerizing an alkenyl aromatic monomer onto ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer as component c . This finding cannot be expected from the prior techniques. It is considered that this effect is ascribable to the graft polymerization of styrene onto ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer by which the miscibility of the terpolymer with polyphenylene oxide is improved greatly so that it can be dispersed into the matrix quite uniformly. In addition to the above mentioned effect, this invention has additional effects such as good weather on y resistance, very slight coloration due to deterioration at high temperature, good surface gloss and so on, sothat the usefulness of this invention is very great. Hereunder, the mode by which this invention is .put into practice will be described in concrete terms. The polyphenylene oxide of component a used in this invention is a polymer having a unit structure represented by the following general formula EMI4.1 or a copolymer of two or more structural units of the above mentioned formula used in amounts not practically lowering the fundamental performances of polyphenylene oxide such as heat resistance, mechanical properties and the like, wherein n is 50 or more. In the formula,R1, R2, R3 and Rh are hydrogen, halogen, a hydrocarbon group, substituted hydrocarbon group, hydrocarbon oxy group or substituted hydrocarbon oxy group.As concrete examples of R1, R2, R3 and Rq, there can be mentioned hydrogen halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine and iodine , hydrocarbon groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tertiary butyl, allyl, phenyl, benzyl and methylbenzyl substituted hydrocarbon groups such as chloromethyl and bromomethyl and hydrocarbon oxy and substituted hydrocarbonoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy, phenoxy and chloroethoxy, Concrete examples of said polymer and copolymer include polymers such as poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4phenylene oxide, poly 2,6 diethyl 1,4 phenylene oxide, poly 2,6 dipropyl 1,4 phenylene oxide, poly 2 methyl 6isopropyl 1,4 phenylene oxide, poly 2,6 dimethoxy l,4 phenylene oxide, poly 2,6 diphenyl l,4 phenylene oxide, poly 2,6 dichloro 1,4 phenylene oxideapd 1,4 phenylene oxide and copolymers such as a copolymer of 2,6 dimethylphenol and 2,3,6 trimethylphenoland a copolymer of 2,6 dimethylphenol and 3 methyl 6 tbutylphenol. Further, the polyphenylene oxide of this invention also includgmodified products of said polymer or copolymer. As examples of the modified products of said polymer or copolymer, there can be mentioned a product produced by oxidatively polymerizing a compound of the following formula EMI5.1 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above, in the presence of ethylene propylene polyene terpolymer, a product produced by oxidatively polymerizing a compound of the following formula EMI6.1 wherein R1 R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above, in the presence of polystyrene, a product produced by polymerizing styrene in the presence of a phenylene oxide polymer or copolymer, a product produced by kneading and reacting a phenylene oxide polymer or copolymer and styrene together with a peroxide in an extruder. The component b used in this invention, i.e.the alkenyl aromatic polymer modified with diene rubber, is a product produced by dispersing diene rubber particles into a matrix of alkenyl aromatic polymer. Herein, the term alkenyl aromatic polymer means polymers and copolymers containing 50 by weight or more of an alkenyl aromatic monomer represented by the following general formula EMI6.2 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are hydrogen, halogen, a hydrocarbon group, substituted hydrocarbon group, hydrocarbon oxy group or substituted hydrocarbon oxy group, and R6 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms. Concrete examples of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 include hydrogen halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine and iodine hydrocarbon groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, vinyl, allyl, benzyl and methylbenzyl substitued hydrocarbon groups such as chloromethyl and bromomethyl and hydrocarbon oxy and substituted hydrocarbon oxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy, phenoxy and monochloromethoxy. Concrete examples of R6 include hydrogen and lower alkyl groups such as methyl and ethyl.As examples of the alkenyl aromatic polymer there can be mentioned polystyrene, polychlorostyrene, poly amethylstyrene, styrene acrylonitrile copolymer, styrenea methylstyrene copolymer, styrene p methylstyrene copolymer, styrene maleic anhydride copolymer and styrene methyl methacrylate copolymer, among which polystyrene is particularly preferable. The diene rubber to be dispersed into such an alkenyl aromatic resin is a rubbery polymer containing a diene component such as butadiene, isoprene ana chlorobutadiene, and includes their homopolymers and their copolymers with various monomers. Concrete examples of said diene rubber include polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polychlorobutadiene, butadiene styrene copolymer, isoprene styrene copolymer, butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer and copolyrners of isobutylene and butadiene or isoprene.As the method for dispersing said diene type rubbery polymer into alkenyl aromatic polymer, there are known various methods any of which may be employed. For example, the mechanical blending method, solution blending method, etc. can be mentioned. Particularly, the method comprising dissolving the rubber into alkenyl aromatic monomer and then polymerizing it is often practised industrially and is usuful because the product is readily available commercially. As concrete examples of such product, there can be mentioned the butadiene rubber modified polystyrene and the styrene butadiene rubber modified polystyrene which are marketed under the name high impact polystyrene, as well as acrylonitrile butadienestyrene copolymer which is marketed under the name ABS resin. In this invention, component a and component b are used in such a proportion that the ratio by weight of component a to component b falls in the range of 1y10 to 10 1. If this ratio is less than 1 10, the excellent heat resistance and mechanical properties of polyphenylene oxide cannot be attained. If this ratio exceeds 10 1,the moldability deteri.ontes because of the smallness of the quantity of component b . Particularly when the ratio is ifl the range of 2 3 to 3 2, mechanical properties and particularly impact strength reach their highest value and moldability is good, so that this range is preferable in the aforementioned range. According to this invention, a copolymer produced by graft polymerizing an alkenyl aromatic monomer onto ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer is added as component c to the above mentioned components a and b . Said a olefin used as the second monomer of the ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer may be any compound as long as it is a hydrocarbon compound having 3 20 carbon atoms. As concrete examples of said a olefin, propylene, l butene, l pentene, 1 hexene, l heptene, styrene, pisopropylstyrene and vinylcyclohexane can be mentioned, among which propylene is particularly important. As said polyene compound used as the third monomer of the ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer to be subjected to graft reaction with the alkenyl aromatic monomer in this invention, there can be used any compound such as 1,4 hexadiene, 1,6 octadiene, 2 methyl 1,5hexadiene, 6 methyl l,5 heptadiene, 7 methyl l,6 octadiene, ll ethyl l,ll tridecadiene, 9 ethyl 1,9undecadiene, isoprene, 1,4 pentadiene, 1,3 pentadiene 1,4,9 decatriene, myrcene, l phenyl l,3 butadiene, pdiallylbenzene, p bromoallylbenzene, 4 vinyl 1 c plo hexene, l,3,5 trivinylcyclohexane, trans 1,2 divinyl cyclobutane, 1,5 cyclooctadiene, 1,3,5 cycloheptatriene, 1,5,9 cyclododecatriene, l, cycloheptadiene, cyclo pentadiene, 2,2 dicyclopentenyl, 1,4 bis cyclopenten 2yl butane, LI,7,8,9 tetrahydroindene, 6 methyl 4,7,8,9 tetrahydroindene, bicyclo 3,3,0 octadiene 2,6 dicyclopentadiene, 2 methyl 2,5 norbornadiene, 5 methylene 2norbornene, 5 ethylidene 2 norbornene, 5 isopropylidene2 norbornene, 5 isopropenyl 2 norbornene, 5 2 methyl l propenyl 2 norbornene, 5 1 ,2 dimethyl l propenyl 2 norbornene, 5 2 butenyl 2 norbornene, 6 methyl 5 2i butenyl 2 norbornene, 6 3 cyclohexenyl 2 nor and bornene, tricyclopentadiene 6 chloromethyl 5 isopropenyl 2 norbornene. As the terpolymer used in this invention, it is preferable to use a terpolymer having such a well known composition that the content of ethylene is 40 90 mol , the content of a olefin is 10 60 mol and the content of polyene compound is 0.3 20 moI and particularly the content of ethylene is 60 85 mol , the content of a olefin is 15 35 mol and the content of polyene compound is 1 5 mol . Apart from above, it is also allowable to use a terpolymer in which the content of polyene compound is more than 20 mol . It is also allowable to use terpolymers in which the contents of ethylene and a olefin are outsidethe above mentioned ranges. Further, said terpolymer may be replaced by, for example, a chlorinated terpolymer, and its use is also included in the process of this invention. The alkenyl aromatic monomer to be polymerized in.this invention is represented by the following general formula EMI11.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are any of hydrogen, halogen a hydrocarbon group, substituted hydrocarbon group, hydrocarbon oxy group and substituted hydrocarbon oxy group, and R6 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms. Concrete examples of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 in the above mentioned formula include hydrogen halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine and iodine hydrocarbon groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, vinyl, allyl, benzyl and methylbenzyl substituted hydrocarbon groups such as chloromethyl and bromomethyl and hydrocarbon oxy and substituted hydrocarbonoxy groups such as methoxy, ethoxy, phenoxy and monochloromethoxy. Concrete examples of R6 include hydrogen lower alkyl groups such as methyl and ethyl. Concrete examples of said alkenyl aromatic monomer include styrene, 2,4 dichlorostyrene, p methoxystyrene, p methylstyrene, p phenylstyrene, p divinylbenzene, p chloromethoxy styrene, a methylstyrene, o methyl a methylstyrene, m methyl a methylstyrene, p methyl alpha methylstyrene and p methoxy alpha methyl styrene. They may be used either alone or in the form of a mixture of two or more. As the method for graft polymerizing alkenyl aromatic monomer onto ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer used in this invention, any of the well known polymerization methods such as the suspension polymerization method, emulsion polymerization method, solution polymerization method, bulk polymerization sod which includes not only the method using a polymerization tank but also the method using an extruder and t ,e like may be employed. In this case, the alkenyl aromatic monomer to be graft polymerized onto ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer is used in an amount such that the ratio by weight of ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer to alkenyl aromatic monomer falls in the range of 1 20 to 20 1.If this ratio is less than 1 20 or exceeds 20 1, the effect brought about by the use of graft polymer is small as compared with the case of single use of the alkenyl aromatic polymer or the ethylene a olefin polyene terpolymer. When this ratio falls in the range of 1 3 to 3 1, the graft copolymer is quite readily miscible and dispersible into polyphenylene oxide and the effect of improving impact resistance is quite great, which is desirable. Particularly, in this invention, this com portent c is added in an amount of 1 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the sum of components a and b . If this amount is less than 1 part by weight, the effect of this invention for improving heat resistance and impact resistance cannot be attained practically.Addition of an amount more than 100 parts by weight is undesirable because it weakens the excellent properties which polyphenylene oxide originally has. Addition of component c in an amount of 5 50 parts by weight is particularly preferable because optimum effect can be achieved under such a condition. In this invention, in addition to the abovementioned components, conventionally employed additives such as heat stabilizerS flame retardantsJ pigments fillers plasticizerS lubricants, ultraviolet absorbers etc. may be addedas long as they do not affect the properties greatly. Further, it is also allowable to add fibrous reinforcing materials such as glass fiber, asbestos fiber, carbon fiber, alumina fiber and the like. As the method for mixing these components a , b , c and the optionally employed various additives in this invention, any method selected from mechanical mixing methods using a mixing machine typified by the roll mill,Banbury mixer, extruder, kneader, etc. or the methods of mixing them in the state of solution or suspension can be utilized. Next, this invention will be explained with reference to concrete examples which are presented in no limitative way but only in an illustrative way.

The granule was injection molded at 2600C or at 3000 C, and Izod impact strengths of the molded products were measured. For comparison, a composition prepared by simply blending polystyrene with ethylene propyleneethylidenenorbornene terpolymer in place of the graft copolymer was similarly kneaded and molded, and the Izod impact strength was measured. The results are shown inTable 5. As is apparent from this table, the composition of Example 8 was greatly improved in impact resistance as compared with the composition of Comparative Example 4, and showed only a very small drop in impact resistance at high temperature. Heat distortion temperature of the composition of Example 8 was also measured to obtain a result of 1250C.

The kneaded mixture was press molded at 2500C or at 2900 C, and Izod impact strengths of the molded products were measured.Thus, the impact strengths were so high as 19 kg.cmicm in the sample molded at 2500C and 18 kg.cm cm in the sample molded at 2900C.The drop in impact strength due to the deterioration at high temperature was very small.Example 10 and Comparative Example 5 The same polyphenylene oxide and high impact polystyrene as in Example 1 and the graft copolymer ofPreparation Example A were kneaded and granulated in the blending ratios shown in Table 6 by means of a twin screw extruder, after which the granules were press molded into a thickness of 0.2 mm to obtain specimens having a width of about 10 mm. The specimen was folded to an angle of 2700 by applying a tension of 1 kg thereto, and the number of foldingsrequired for breakage was measured. By the addition of the graft copolymer, the number of foldings was greatly improved.
