# A tape remaining circuit.

## Abstract
The tension arm position of a tape recorder is sensed and any change in position is added as a correction factor to the capstan tach or tape timer tach count generated during a reel tach period. To this end, the tension arm position signal is clamped to ground at the start of the capstan count. At the end of the capstan count, the tension arm position is sensed to provide a value that is proportional to the change in the position that has occurred during the capstan count. The va lue is then added to the capstan count to provide a corrected capstan count that no longer contains a tension arm error and constitutes a precise tape remaining output signal.
