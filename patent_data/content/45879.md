DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to the drawings, it will be seen that the illustrative razor blade assembly includes a platform member 1 having a base portion 2. The platform member 1 is joined to a cap portion 4. First arm means 6 extend frorn the base portion 2 and are joined to a guard portion 8 extending generally parallel to the base portion. Preferably, the first arm means 6 includ a first set of arms 9, including a first arm 10 proximate a first end 12 of the platform member 1 and a second arm 14 proximate a second end 16 of the platform member, the first arm 10 joining the guard portion 8 proximate a first end 18 of the guard portion and a secondarm.14 joining the guard pori proximate a second end 20 of the guard portion.The first set of arms 9 preferably includes additional arms 21 disposed between the first and second arms 10, 14. The blade assernbly further includes a second arm means 22 disposed inardly of the ends of the platform member 1 and extending from the base portion generally toward, and terminating short of, the guard portion. In the embodiment shown, the second arm means 22 include second and third ets of arms 24, 26. A first blade means 28 is disposed on the second set f arms 24 and a second blade means 30 is disposed on the third set of arms 26. Preferably, the base portion 2, arm means 6, 22, and guard portion 8 are f molded material and are molded as a single, unitary and integral member.he arm means function as leaf springs, permitting movement of the guard ort on and the blade means relative to the base portion and the cap portion nd to each other, during a shaving operation. As seen in Fig. 1, the first blade means 28 is provided with apertures i2 through which extend the third set of arms 26, the ends of which support he second blade means 30. The platform member 1 Includes a frame portion 34 extending parallel to he base portion 2 and interconnecting the platform end portions 12, 16. EX ending between the frame portion 34 and the base portion 2 are bridge members 56, each provided with first, second and third protrusions, 38, 40, 42. As ill be further described below, the protrusion 38 operates as a stop means for the first blade means 28 and the protrusion 40 operates as a stop means for the second blade means 30. The second protrusions 40 extend through openings 44 in the first blade means 28, enabling the second protrusions to be engaged by the second blade means 30. The third protrusions 42 extend through apertures 46 In the first blade means 28 to underlie the second blade means 30. The cap portion 4 includes downwardly exiending piolrtisions 4 wiliCh pass through holes 50 in the second blade means 30 and overlie the upper surface of the first blade means 28. Preferably, the bridge members are molded integrally with the rernainde .of the platform ember 1 and the protrusions 48 are molded portions of the cap 4. In assembly, the platform and cap portions are molded with means for interconnection. In the illustrated embodiment, the cap 4 is provided with end portions 52 interconnected by a back portion 54. Rivet members 56 depe rom the end portions 52 and the back portion 54. The platform portion 1 provided with holes 58 on its end portions 12, 16 and base portion 2 adapte to receive the rivet members 56. The second blade means 30 is placed on tl underside of the cap portion 4, inverted for the assembly operation, with 1 protrusions 48 extending through the holes 50. The first blade means 28 is then placed over the second blade means 30.The platform portion 1 is fit onto the cap portion 4 and over the first blade means 28, the apertures 32 46 and openings 44 permitting the third set of arms 26 and the protrusions 42 to extend through the first blade means. The rivet members 56 are secu in the platform holes 58 by heading over,bringing the second blade means to rest on the third set of arms 26. The cap portion 4 is formed with a shoulder 60 which bears against the first blade means 28, as seen in Fig. The guard portion 8 has on either end thereof outwardly extendin.det 62 which, in assembly, are received by recesses 64 in the cap end portions 52 The guard portion 8 is further provided with stoD portions 63 on the underside of the guard portion, the stop portions 63 being in alignment wi stop portions 65 upCJ anding from the frame memùber 34. Two of the stop portions 65 may comprise portions of the bridge members 36. Thus, the first blade means 28 rests upon the second set of anns 24 proximate the cutting edge of the first blade means, the rearward edge thereof being loosely held in a pocket 66 CFig. 8 formed by the cap and platform portions, and particularly the shoulder portion 60 of the cap. The pocket 66 provides sufficient freedorn to permit the first blade means to pivot about its rears ard edge. The upstanding protrusions 42 preen. the first blade from sliding forwardly or backwardly. In similar manner, the second blade means rests upon the third set of arms 26 its rearward edge being disposed in a pocket 68 formed by the cap portion and the protrusions 42.The pocket 68 provides sufficient freedom to permit the second blade to pivot about its rearward edge. The second blade means is prevented from sliding forwardly or backwardly by the protrusions 48. In use, the guard portion 8 is rreely movable during a shaving operation by virtue of the spring leaf like qualities of the arns 10,14. The stop portions 65 of the frame portion 34 and upper surfaces 67 of the recesses 64 limit the movement of the guard portion, the guard stop portions 63 abutting the frame stop portions 65 at the lower extent of the permissible movement of the guard portion, and the detents 62 abutting the upper surfaces 67 of the recesses 64 at the upper extent of the permissible movement of the guard portion. In like manner, the blade means 28, 30 are each freelyand independently movable during a shaving operation by virtue of the spring leafli.ke qualities of the arms 24, 26.The cutting edge of the first blade means 28 can be depressed, or moved downwardly and pivotally about its rear edge, until the first blade means strikes the first protrusion 38. In like manner, the second blade means 30 can be depressed, or moved downwardly and pivotally about its rear edge until tha second blade means strikes the seco protrusion 40. During a shaving operation, the guard and blade members may move dynamically in response to forces and pressures acting on the blade assembly during shaving, the guard and blade means being movable in a substantially arcuatepath about a rear portion of the blade assembly. In Figs. 9 and 10, there is illustrated an alternative embodiment in which the first blade means 28 is provided with enlarged apertures 32 , greatly reducing the surface area of the first blade means. With the enlarged apertures 32 , the first blade means essentially comprises a first cutting edge strand portion 100 of blade material, a first parallel base strand portion 102 of blade material, interconnecting end strand portions 1 and interconnecting intermediate strand portions 106.In a similar manner, the second blade means 30 is provided with enlarged holes 50 , substantial reducing the surface area of the second blade means. With the enlarged holes 50 , the second blade means essentially comprises a second cutting ed strand portion 110 of blade material, a second parallel base strand portion 112 of blade material, interconnecting end strand portions 114 and Inter connecting intermediate strand portions 115. Referring particularly to Fig. 10, it will be seen that the first and second protrusions 381, 40 are provided with flat upper surfaces 118,i120. Similarly, the second and third sets of arms 24 , 26 are provided with fla upper surfaces 122, 124. The surfaces 122 engage and support an underside of the first cutting edge strand portion 10D, of the first blade means 28 . The surfaces 124 engage and support an underside of the second cutting edge strand portion 110 of the second blade means 30 . The surface 118 of the first protrusion 38 acts as a stop means for the first blade means 2St d the surface 120 acts as a stop means for the second blade means 301 The at upper surfaces 118, 120, 122, 124 insure sufficient and stable contact th the relatively limited associated blade area. The alternative embodiment of Figs.9 and 10, provides a more operl zor head, facilitating the flow of shaving debris therethrough. Referring particularly to Figs. 1 and 2, it will be seen that the central m70 of the second set of arms 24 is substantially U shaped, permitting a ntral location of such arm, as well as a central location for the central m 72 of the third set of arms 26. The blade assembly is provided with attachment means 74 by which the sembly may be releasably connected to a razor handle. The structure and eration of such attachment means is fully shown and described in U. S.tent Application Serial No. 101,261. Alternatively, the blade assembly may permanently fixed to a handle not shown the entire blade assembly and ndle constituting a razor which is disposable as a unit after dulling of e blade cutting edges. In Fig. 11, there is illustrated an additional alternative embodiment in tich the guard portion 8 is fixed to the base portion 2 , .leaving the Xmainder of the assembly substantially as described above. Thus, in o eratlor., .e blade means.28 , 30 are independently movable during a shaving operaon. the blade means 28 , 30 being adapted to move dynamical y with their spective sets of supporting arms in response to forces acting on the blade . assembly during shaving. As in the previously described embodiments, the ade means are movable in a substantially arcuate path about a rear portion the blade assembly. It s to be understood that the present invention is by no means limited to the particular construction herein disclosed and or shown in the drawings, but also comprises any modifications or equivalents within the scope of the disclosure. For example, suitable attachment means of a different type are shown and described in U. S. Patents Nos. 3,703,764 and 3,832,774. The attach ment moans therein described utilize parallel grooves and rails, facilitating a siide attachment between a razor handle and a blade assembly.EMI10.1
