# Radial truck for railway vehicle.

## Abstract
A short wheelbase railroad truck 1 having two axles 9,10 or 209,210 intended to assume a radial configuration when the railroad vehicle rounds curves comprises a frame having two side members 2,3 or 202,203 and axles mounted in bearing means 11,14 or 211,214 . The bearing means are pivotally attached to the frame members with at least two of the bearing means being attached to the frame members by means of steering levers 15 or 215 which are pivotally attached to the associated bearing means and the frame members for independent pivotal movement. Steering rods 18 or 218 connect each steering lever to the vehicle body such that the chording of the vehicle as it rounds a curve will each axle to the radial alignment. In one embodiment each axle is guided by such steering rods and levers. In another embodiment one axle is guided by steering rods and levers and the side members move relatively longitudinally to guide the other axle.
