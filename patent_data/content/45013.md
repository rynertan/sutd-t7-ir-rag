# Treatment of sour gases to concentrate H2S for Claus process by recycling amine absorbent.

## Abstract
Sour industrial gases containing carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide are treated with aqueous amine absorb ents to remove the CO₂ and H₂S. The absorbent 12 con taining or loaded with H₂S and CO₂ is regenerated 24 and the off gas containing concentrated amounts of H₂S and CO₂ is treated in a second amine absorber 34 to produce an absorbent loaded with H₂S. This amine is then regenerated 54 to provide an off gas containing a high ratio of H₂S to CO₂ which can be used as the feed gas to a sulfur recovery unit. The process is automatically con trolled by 70,66 so that the concentration of H₂S in the se cond amine absorber is concentrated and controlled at a desired point so that the off gas has the required H₂S CO₂ ratio.
