# WASTEWATER TREATMENT PROCESS

## Abstract
High BOD clarified wastewater is treated in a contactor with activated sludge for rapid BOD absorption without appre ciable metabolism of the BOD. Shortly thereafter the sludge is separated from the effluent of reduced BOD. The sludge is aer ated to restore its BOD absorption capacity and recycled to the contactor for treatment of incoming wastewater.
