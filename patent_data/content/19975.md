# Colour display tube.

## Abstract
A colour display tube comprising in an evacuated envelope an electron gun system 60 to generate three electron beams directed on a display window. For each electron beam the electron gun system 60 is provided with a cathode which is secured in a cup shaped control grid 61 having an aperture by means of an electrically insulating material. The control grids 61 are secured in a cup shaped anode 63 by means of a plate of electrically insulating material 62 . The electron gun system 60 may be constructed with a focusing electrode 64 which is common for the three electron beams and a common accelerating electrode 67 . A sleeve shaped electrode 71 may be secured to the anode 63 in which the focusing electrode 64 is secured by means of a ring of electrically insulating material 74 .
