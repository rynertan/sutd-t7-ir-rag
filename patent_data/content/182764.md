# Electromechanical film and procedure for manufacturing same.

## Abstract
The present invention concerns a dielectric film for con verting the energy of an electric field or of a magnetic field into mechanical work, or for converting mechanical work into electric energy, and a procedure for manufacturing the film. The film of the invention consists of a homogeneous, e.g. a film layer A foamed to a structure C of full cell type and which has been oriented by stretching it in two dimensions and coated at least in part on one side or on both sides with an electrically conductive layer B . The film is manufactured by extruding the plastic which has been made to be foam able, into tubular shape, performing intermediate cooling of the tube and reheating it, expanding the heated tube in two dimensions, metallizing the outer surfaces and cutting the tube open to become a film.
