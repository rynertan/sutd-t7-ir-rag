# Polymers containing amide linkages and process for the preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A new resinous polymer containing amide linkages wherein the amide nitrogen is part of the polymer backbone is prepared by polymerizing at least one alpha, beta unsaturated monocarboxylic acid or ammonium salt thereof in the presence of ammonia. The polymers are suitable for use as fibres, plastics films and moulding resins. A random copolymer containing the following structural units T is a branched chain site, M is OH, ONH₄, ONH₂T or NHT and x, y, and z are independently the number of such structural units in the resinous polymer of the invention is also disclosed.
