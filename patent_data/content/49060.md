These tests are indicative of antidepressant activity. The results obtained in these tests are shown on pages 15 and 30. 1 Prevention of Reserpine induced Hypothermia The method of Spencer in Anti Depressant Drugs Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium , p 184 204. Ed. Garattini, S and Dukes MNG, ExcerptaMed Foundation, Amsterdam, 1967, was used. Groups of 5 mice were given oral doses of the test compound 24 hours, 18 hours and 2 hours before an intravenous injection of 1 mg kg reserpine base. The oral temperatures of the mice were taken immediately before the administration of the reserpine and 6 hours afterwards. Mean temperatures of groups given test compounds are compared with the mean temperatures of the reserpinised controls using the Students t test. Compounds causing significant difference at the level p 0.05 are considered active at that dose. 2 Potentiation of the Effects of 5 Hydroxytryptophan 5.TP Potentiation was measured in mice using the potentiation of the anti convulsant activity of 5 HTP originally. described by Buus Lassen J., 1975 ,Psychopharmacol, 42, 21 6. Mice 10 group were pretreated with the compounds under investigation and 30 later received a sub threshold level dose ofL 5 HTP 100 mg kg ip . 30 minutes later they were subjected to electroshock and the shock level in V required to cause tonic extensor spasm in 50 of the mice determined for all groups. The dose of compounds required to increase the elevation of electroshock threshold due to 5HTP by 100 is determined graphically. 3 Some of the compounds of the invention have been shown to be monoamine oxidase inhibitors. 4 In other initial tests the compound of formula it EMI32.1 has been shown to be a selective and reversible inhibitor of the A form of monoamine oxidase. The compound also appears to have a low level of toxicity.There are also indications that the compound may have a usefully prolonged duration of action. The LD50 in mice of the compound is 900 mg kg orally. 5 In none of the tests reported herein were any toxic effects observed
