## Description
This invention relates to novel heterocyclic derivatives having action on histamine receptors, to processes for the preparation thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutics. Certain novel heterocyclic derivatives have now been found which have potent activity as H2 antagonists.These compounds, which are more particularly described below, for example show inhibition of the secretion of gastric acid when this is stimulated via histamine receptors Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmacol. Chemother, 1966, 27, 427 . Their ability to do so can be demonstrated in the perfused rat stomach using the method described inGerman Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,734,070, modified by the use of sodium pentobarbitone 50 mg kg as anaesthetic instead of urethane, and in conscious dogs equipped withHeidenhain pouches using the method described by Black et al, Nature 1972, 236, 385. Furthermore, the compounds antagonise the effect of histamine on the contraction frequency of isolated guinea pig right atrium but do not modify histamine induced contractions of isolated gastrointestinal smooth muscle which are mediated via H1receptors. Compounds with histamine H2 blocking activity may be used in the treatment of conditions where there is an advantage in lowering gastric acidity, particularly in gastric and peptic ulceration, as a prophylactic measure in surgical procedures, and in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions where histamine is a known mediator. Thus they may be used for example, either alone, or in combination with other active ingredients in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions of the skin. The present invention provides compounds of the general formula I EMI2.1 and physiologically acceptable salts, hydrates and bioprecursors thereof in which R1 represents hydrogen, C1 10 alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, trifluoroalkyl or C1 10 alkyl substituted by hydroxy, alkoxy or dialkylamino or C16 alkyl substituted by cycloalkyl R2 represents hydrogen or a C14 alkyl group or R1 and R2 may together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 5 10 membered ring which may be saturated or may contain at least one double bond, may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more C 1 3 alkyl groups or a hydroxy group and or may contain another heteroatom selected from oxygen or sulphur Alk represents a straight or branched C16 alkylene chain Q represents a benzene ring in which incorporation into the rest of the molecule is through bonds at the 1and 3 positions or 1 and 4 positions X represents oxygen, sulphur or a methylene group n represents zero, 1 or 2 m represents 2, 3 or 4 with the proviso that n m is at least 3 R3 represents alkenyl, alkoxy or alkyl substituted by hydroxy, acyloxy, alkoxy, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, aryl, heteroaryl or C14 alkylsulphonyl or R3 represents COR4 or CR4 NOH where R4 represents hydrogen or C14 alkyl. The term alkyl as a group or part of a group means that the group is straight or branched and unless otherwise stated has preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. methyl or ethyl, and the terms alkenyl and alkynyl mean that the group is straight or branched and has 3 to 6 carbon atoms. The term cycloalkyl means that the group has 3 to 8 carbon atoms.The acyl portion of an acyloxyalkyl group means an aroyl, aralkanoyl or C16 alkanoyl group. Examples of acyloxyalkyl groups include acetoxymethyl, formyloxymethyl, benzoyloxymethyl and phenylacetoxymethyl. The term aryl as a group or part of a group preferably represents phenyl or substituted phenyl, for example phenyl substituted with one or more C13 alkyl, hydroxy, or C13 alkoxy groups or halogen atoms. The term heteroaryi as a group or part of a heteroaralkyl group preferably refers to a monocyclic unsaturated 5 or 6membered ring containing an oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur atom, e.g. furyl, pyridyl or thienyl.The alkyl part of the heteroaralkyl group is a straight or branched C14 alkylene chain e.g. methylene. When the group R1R2N represents a heterocyclic ring it preferably contains 5 8 members and optionally contains one double bond and or is substituted by one or two C1 3 alkyl e.g. methyl groups or a hydroxy group e.g. pyrrolidino, piperidino, hexamethylenimino, heptamethylenimino, tetrahydropyridino, 4 hydroxypiperidino, 2,6 dimethylmorpholino or thiamorpholino . Preferred groupings for the compounds of the invention are as follows Q is a benzene ring incorporated into the rest of the molecule through bonds at the 1 and 3 positions X is oxygen, n is zero and m is 3 or 4 R1R2N is a 5 7 membered ring, e.g. hexamethylenimino or, more preferably pyrrolidino or piperidino Alk is a C14 alkylene chain more preferably methylene R3 is aralkyl e.g. benzyl or, more preferably, hydroxy C14 alkyl e.g. hydroxymethyl or hydroxyethyl , acyloxy C14 alkyl e.g. acyloxy C12 alkyl such as acetoxymethyl or benzoyloxy methyl , formyl, the group CH NOH or methyl sulphonylmethyl. Particularly preferred compounds are 5 4 3 1 piperidinylmethyl phenoxy butyl 1H 1,2,4 triazole 3 methanol, 5 4 3 1 piperidinylmethyl phenoxy butyl 1H 1,2,4 triazole 3 2 ethanol , 5 E4 l piperidinylmet y1 phenoxylpropyll lH l,2,4 triazole 3 methanol, 5 4 3 1 piperidinylmethyl phenoxy butyl 1H 1,2,4 triazole 3 methylacetate, 3 methylsulphonyl methyi 5 4 3 1 piperidinylmethyl phenoxy butyl 1H 1,2,4 triazole, 5 4 3 l piperidinylmethyl3phenoxyJbutyl lH lt2t4 triazole 3 carboxaldehyde hydrate, and 5 4 E3 l piperidinylmethyl phenoxygbutyl lH 12 4 triazole 3 carboxyaldehyde oxime, and their physiologically accepatble salts. The invention includes the compounds of formula I in the form of physiologically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic acids. Particularly useful salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides and sulphates, methanesulphonates, acetates, maleates, succinates, tartrates, benzoates, citrates and fumarates. The compounds of formula I and their salts may also form hydrates, which hydrates are also to be considered as part of the invention.The compounds of formula I can exhibit tautomerism and the formula is intended to cover all tautomers. Where optical isomers may exist the formula is intended to cover all diastereoisomers and optical enantiomers. The term bioprecursors as used herein means compounds which have a structure different to that of the compounds of formula I but which, upon administration to the animal or human being, are converted in the body into a compound of formula I . The compounds according to the invention, preferably in the form of a salt, may be formulated for administration in any convenient way and the invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention adapted forusein human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically accetable carriers or excipients. Such compositions may also contain if required other active ingredients, e.g. H1 antagonists. Thus the compounds according to the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, topical,.parenteral or rectal administration. Oral administration is preferred. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may take the form of for example, tablets, capsules, powders, solutions, syrups or suspensions prepared by conventional means with acceptable excipients.For buccal administration the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form in ampoules, or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use. The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glyceride. For topical application, the compounds of the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams, gels, lotions, powders or sprays in a conventional manner. For internal administration a convenient daily dosage regime of the compounds according to the invention is 1 to 4 doses to the total of 100 mg to 2 g per day, preferably 500 mg to 1 g per day, dependent upon the condition of the patient. It will be appreciated in the the methods for the preparation of the compound of formula I given below that for certain reaction steps it may be necessary to protect various reactive substituents in the starting materials for a particular reaction and subsequently to remove the protecting group. Such protection and subsequent deprotection may be particularly pertinent when R1 and or R2 are hydrogen and or when the substituentR3 is an alkyl group bearing a hydroxyl group or a primary or secondary amine. Standard protection and deprotection procedures can be employed, for example, amines may be protected by formation of a phthalimide group which may subsequently be cleaved by treatment with a hydrazine e.g. hydrazine hydrate or a primary amine for example methylamine. In describing the processes which may be used for preparing the compounds of formula I or intermediates useful in the preparation thereof any of the groups R1,R2, R3, Alk, Q, X, n and m are as defined in formula I unless otherwise stated. Compounds of formula I may be prepared by cyclisation of the compound of formula II in which one of V and Y represents NH and the other represents oxygen, sulphur or NH. It should be noted that when V or Y is sulphur, tautomerisation with the adjacent NH is possible N C SH 3 t and the resulting thiol may be converted into the corresponding S alkyi, e.g. S methyl, derivative which may also be used in the cyclisation. EMI7.1 Thus in one embodiment of the cyclisation process compounds of formula I may be prepared by heating a compound of formula II in which V is oxygen and Y is NH or V is NH and Y is oxygen. The reaction is preferably carried out in the absence or, more preferably, in the presence of a solvent e.g. ethanol at an elevated temperature e.g. 60 1600C. The compounds of formula II wherein V is NH andY is O or V is 0 and Y is NH may be prepared by reaction of an iminoether III or IV with a hydrazide V or VI respectively in the presence of a solvent e.g. methanol or ethanol. Preferably the reaction is carried out at 0 250C. EMI7.2 where R3 is the group R3 or a group convertible thereto such as haloalkyi which may be converted into an acyloxyalkyl group R8 is an alkyl group e.g. methyl or ethyl. NH2NHCOR3 R1R2NAlkQ CH2 nX CH2 mCONHNH2 V VI The iminoethers III and TV may be prepared from the corresponding nitriles VII or R3CN by treatment with an anhydrous alcohol e.g. ethanol in the presence of hydrogen chloride preferably at a low temperature e.g.0 30C. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent e.g. methylene chloride. R1R2NA1kQ CH2 nX CH2 mCN VII The hydrazides V and VI may be prepared by reaction of the esters VIII and R3C02Rg with hydrazine hydrate at 25 1000C in the absence or presence of a solvent e.g. ethanol. RlR2NAlkQ CH23nX CH2 mC 2Rg VIII where Rg C1 4 alkyl. The nitriles VII and the esters VIII may be prepared by using methods analogous to those described inBritish Patent Specification No. 2047238A. Aldehydes or ketones of formula I in whichR3 is the group COR4 may be prepared by oxidising the corresponding hydroxyalkyl compound in which R3 is CHR4OH using for example oxalyl chloride and dimethyl sulphoxide, or activated manganese dioxide in a solvent such as chlorofor. Compounds of formula I in which R3 is the group CR4 NOH may be prepared by reacting the corresponding carbonyl compound R3 is COR4 with hydroxylamine in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, optionally with heating. Compounds of formula I3 in which R3 represents an acyloxyalkyl group may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula I in which R3 represents a hydroxyalkyl group with a carboxylic acid or an activated derivative thereof which corresponds to the acyl group. Suitable activated derivatives include acid halides, e.g. acid chlorides and acid anhydrides. When an acid chloride is used, the reaction is preferably carried out in for example pyridine at room temperature. Where the product of any of the above processes is a free base and a salt is required, the salt may be formed in a conventional manner. Thus for example, a generally convenient method of forming the salts is to mix appropriate quantities of the free base and the acid in an appropriate solvent s e.g. an alcohol such as ethanol or an ester such as ethyl acetate.

The solution is prepared, clarified and filled under nitrogen into appropriate sized ampoules sealed by fusion of the glass. The injection is sterilised by heating in an autoclave using one of the acceptable cycles. Alternatively the solution may be sterilised by filtration and filled into sterile ampoules under aseptic conditions. The compounds of Examples 2 a , 2 e , 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 have ED50 values of less than 0.63 mg kg in the perfused rat stomach test. The compounds of the invention have in general low toxicity at doses at which they effectively inhibit gastric acid secretion. Thus for example the compounds of Examples 7 and 9 produced no toxic effects when administered intravenously to rats at doses of at least twice their ED50 values. In addition, the compound of Example 6 produced no toxic effects when administered orally to rats at a dose of 400 mg kg.
