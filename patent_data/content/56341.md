# Acceleration limit reset arrangement for a fuel control device of a gas turbine engine.

## Abstract
Acceleration limit reset arrangement for a fuel control device of a gas turbine engine, said device 11 including a proportional speed loop 34, 36 slaved to a demanded speed signal Nd formed by integrating in an integral loop 26, 28, 32 an accelera tion term Nd Ngs a comparator 28 in the integral loop 26, 28, 32 compares the acceleration term Nd Ngs to a limit As and, if the acceleration term Nd Ngs is in excess of the limit As , regulates the rate of change of the actual engine speed Nh to the limit As the limit As is scheduled by an acceleration deceleration limiter circuit 30 as substantially equivalent to the surge line of the engine 10 the acceleration limit reset arrange ment 38, 40, 42, 44 is responsive to the scheduled limit value As of the acceleration limit and to the scheduled and actual engine speed signals Ngs, Nh for modifying as a function of the difference between said scheduled and actual engine speed signals Ngs, Nh the scheduled limit As during transient conditions and for generating an acceleration limit Al for the fuel control device 11 as a modified scheduled value.
