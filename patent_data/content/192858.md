# Bale accumulator and discharger.

## Abstract
A bale accumulator 10 is provided for use in conjunc tion with a baler 5 from which, during operation, bales B successively are discharged. The accumulator 10 compris es a bale receiving table 111 movable between a home position for receiving a bale B from the baler 5 and a bale transfer position. A loadbed 40 is disposed to receive bales B from the bale receiving table 111 and to accumulate a plurality of bales B thereon. The bale receiving table 111 is pivotally mounted on a shuttle mechanism 130 which itself is movable along a transverse linear path between retracted and extended positions. Table positioning means 119, 144 196 are provided for moving the receiving table 111 from its home position to its bale transfer position and vice versa. Loadbed positioning means 33 pivot the loadbed 40 from a horizontal home position for accumulating a plurality of bales B thereon to a bale dumping position and vice versa. When the loadbed 40 is pivoted to its bale dumping position, the bale receiving table 111 is held in its bale transfer position alongside and generally at the level of the loadbed 40 to effectively enlarge the bale holding capacity thereof. A tailgate 80 is pivotally mounted on the loadbed 40 and is firmly held in its operative position during an initial portion of the bale dumping movement of the loadbed 40 for accumulated bales B to slide thereagainst, whereafter the tailgate 80 is allowed to retract during the subsequent portion of the loadbed dumping movement to provide simultaneous discharge of all accumulated bales B . Conveyor means 125 are provided on the bale receiv ing table 111 which are operable, on the one hand, to further advance a bale B along the length of the bale receiving table 111 as it is received thereon and, on the other hand, to assist in the discharge of accumulated bales B from the loadbed 40 .
