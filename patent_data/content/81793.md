## Description
Novel Vitamin D3 Derivatives and Process for Producing the SameField of the Invention The present invention relates to 6,19 epidioxyvitamin D3 derivatives of formula I EMI1.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group when R1 is a hydrogen atom, R2 represents a hydroxyl group and R3 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group when bothR1 and R2 represent a hydroxyl group, R3 is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group and when R1 is a hydroxyl group andR2 is a hydrogen atom, R3 represents a hydroxyl group .Background of the Invention As a result of the studies by DeLuca and Kodicek on the separation and identification of the metabolites of vitamin D3 and on its metabolism, it has been established that vitamin D3 is first hydroxylated at 25 position in the liver to form 25 hydroxyvitamin D3, then is hydroxylated at 24R position or at la position in the kidney to form la,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 24R,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 having hormone activity. It is also well known that these metabolites and other synthetic analogs such as la hydroxyvitamin D3 thereof enhance intestinal calcium transport and bone mineral mobilization and are useful as therapeutic agents to treat the diseases caused by various disorders in calcium metabolism. A recent study based on experiments with a myeloid leukemia cell line M1 isolated from an St mouse with myeloid leukemia has revealed that the above named vitaminD3 derivatives can induce differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells and that they are at least about 100 times as potent as dexamethasone the most potent inducer ever known Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 78, 4990 1981 . Sachs Brit. J.Haematol., 40, 509 1978 and Hozumi Gan to Kagaku ryoho Cancer and Chemotherapy , 8 1 , 9, 1981 have suggested that compounds capable of inducing differfatiation of myeloid leukemia cells can be used to treat leukemia and that use of these compounds is promising as a supplement to the conventional chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But having a very great ability to induce differentiation, these derivatives also have significant effects on calcium metabolism in vivo, and an overdose of them may cause hypercalcemia. So, the derivatives are not completely satisfactory for use as a drug to treat leukemia which sometimes requires continuous administration of the drug in high dose.Summary of the Invention The present inventors have made various studies on vitamin D3 derivatives and have found that 6,19 epidioxyvitamin D3 derivatives are highly capable of inducing differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells with minimum effects on calcium metabolism and that hence, they are useful as an agent to treat leukemia.Detailed Description of the Invention The ability of the compounds I of the present invention to induce differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells was determined by the following method. HL 60 cells human myeloid leukemia cell line were cultured at 370C in RPMI 1640 medium GIBCO, Grand Island,NY supplemented with 10 heat inactivated fetal calf serum Flow Laboratories, Rockville, MD and 100 U ml of penicillin and 100 pg ml of streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5 CO2 in air. Cells were inoculated at 1 x 105 cells ml and incubated with various concentrations of inducing compounds.The differentiation associated properties were tested 3 days after inoculation. The formation of Fc and C3 rosettes was assayed according to the method of Lotem and Sachs Int. J.Cancer 15, 731 1975 using sheep erythrocytes coated with rabbit anti sheep erythrocytes antibody, or with the antibody and mouse complement, respectively. The percentage of cells with a rosette to which at least 5 erythrocytes were bound was counted with a hemocytometer. At least 200 cells were counted. Phagocytic activity was measured according to the method of Collins et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 2458 1978 . Cells were suspended at a concentration of 2 x 106 cells ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum and 10 human AB serum. Candida albicans were washed with saline and added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 4 x 106 ml. The suspension was incubated at 370C for 30 min. The percentage of cells that had phagocytosed at least one Candida was counted with a hemocytometer. The results of the experiment are shown in the following table, wherein Ia to If for the chemicals names are keyed to the symbols used in Examples 1 to 3.

Experiment Weanling Sprague Dawley male rats weighing 45 to 50g were fed on Diet 11 and deionized water under an incandescent lamp for a period of 6 weeks. They were administered orally a solution of each compound in MCT medium chain triglyceride of The Mlsshin Oil Mills, Ltd. once a day. The aminals were starved, beheaded and bled to obtain blood samples. The duodenum was removed from each animal and checked for 45Ca absorption by the inverted intestimal tract method Amer.J. Pysics., 216, 1351 1969 . Plasma was separated from the blood samples and the contents of calcium and inorganic phosphorus were determined by the OCPC method Am. J. Clin.Path., 45, 290 1966 and the method of Peel and Loughman Biochem. J., 65, 709 1957 , respectively. The compounds of the present invention were far less capable of transporting calcium from the intestinal tract than known vitamin D3 compounds such as la hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1a,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3. The compounds had also a very weak effect on the concentrations of phosphorus and calcium in plasma. The compounds of formula I of the present invention are novel and they include 6,19 epidioxy 9,10 secocholesta 5 10 ,7 dien 3B,24 diol, 6,19 epidioxy 9,10 secocholesta 5 10 ,7 dien la,3B,24 triol, 6,19 epidioxy 9,10 secocholesta 5 10 w7 dien la,3ss,24,25 tetraol and 6,19 epidioxy 9,10 secocholesta 5 10 ,7 dien la,3R,25 triol. These compounds can be prepared by subjecting corresponding vitamin D3 compounds, say, 24 hydroxyvitamin D3, la, 24 dihydroxyvitamin D3, la,24,25 trihydroxyvitamin D3 and la,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 to photosensitized oxidation. This can be done by illuminating the corresponding vitamin D3 compounds with visible light emitting sources such as a halogen lamp or tangsten lamp in oxygen or air as they are dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol or propanol in the presence of an organic pigment such as Rose Bengal, Eosine or methylene blue. The illumination period preferably continues until the vitamin D3 compounds are no longer present in the reaction system. The compounds I can be isolated from the reaction mixture by a conventional method, such as distilling off the solvent followed by column chromatography.The end compounds I have an asymmetric carbon atom at 6or 24 position, and in each case, they include 2 to 4 optical isomers. The present invention is now described in greater detail by reference to the following examples which are given here for illustrative purposes only and are by no means intended to limit its scope.Example 1 A mixture of 24R hydroxyvitdmin D3 2.0 mg and RoseBengal 10 mg was dissolved in a mixed solvent consisting of benzene 24 mg and ethanol 6 ml , and the solution was illuminated with a halogen lamp 200 W for 40 minutes under cooling with ice.
