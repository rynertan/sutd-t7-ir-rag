# Circular knitting machine.

## Abstract
In circular knitting machines one source of imperfection in the finished fabric is vibration arising at the point of meshing between a ring gear for the needle cylinder and a driving pinion. In accordance with the invention, this is overcome or mitigated by lengthening the transmission path between the ring gear and the needle cylinder and also by inclusion, where appropriate, of a vibration damping device. As shown in Fig. 1, a needle cylinder 20 is mounted on a disc 21 on a hollow shaft 22 driven by a wheel 24 . Drive to the wheel 24 is from a ring gear 40 , mounted on a support ring 12 , via transmission arms 26 . A vibration disperser or damping device has a ring shaped end 31 clamping a hub portion of a support table 13 in which a shaft 22 is mounted. The opposite end 30 of the damping device is solid with a separate supporting frame 16 which also mounts a drive M and 80 for a pinion 41 in mesh with the ring gear 40 .

## Description
CIRCULAR KNITTING MACHINE The present invention relates to circular knitting machines and more particularly to circular knitting machines of a novel type wherein the needle cylinder is not directly driven by a driving pinion and the distaiice of power transmission between the driving pinion and the needle cylinder is comparatively lenghted, and in which a vibrato on or oscillation damping means is provided whereby unbalanced vibration or oscillation occuring on each needle cylinder, which would bring about undesirable horizontal lines upon the knitted fabric during the operation of the knitting machine, is compensated and attenuated. Generally, a conventional circular knitting machine einploys a driving pinion to engage with a large ring gear provided on the needle cylinder. There is no provision at the central portion of the ring gear, for ally centre shaft or any other centre supporting means, and the gear is directly driven by the pinion to rotate supported by an annular guide or bearing groove provided on the machine frame.Since no centre shaft provided for either the gear or the guide groove and because of the clearance between the teeth of the pinion and the ring gear, vibrations occur and because of the difference of the distance from each needle to the mesh point or the power input point of the driving pinion and the driven ring gear, the vibrations or oscillations have a differential effect. During each evolution, when a given one of the cylinder needles rotates to the position where it is nearest the vibration source i.e. the mesh point , the vibration or oscillation is strongest, and where it is furthest from the vibration source, the vibration or oscillation is weakest. Because of the great differences in the magnitudes of vibration occurred on needles, uijdesirable, irregular horizontal lines tend to appear on the knitted fabrics, degrading the quality of the fabrics. Of course, iiiidcsirable horizontal lines are also caused by reasons otlier than the above mentioned vibration or oscillation, such as the uneven tension of yawns, the inadequate adjustment of cams, the uneven tension of fabric roll, and so forth. Nevertheless, these causes may easily be eliminated and controlled by adjusting the i ension of yards and fabric, and the correct positioning of cams. and the elimination of these causes cannot totally elinilnate the undesirable horizontal lines there are still lines appearing once on the knitted fabric for each rotation of the needle cylinder. To prove that the undesirable horizontal lines occur from the uneven vibration, the inventor has taken a conventional double knit circular knitting machine of 30 gauge to make an experiment therewith. The inventor smeared some coloured ink on a yarn feed corresponding to the cam which is closest to the mesh point between the pinion and the ring gear so as to have the yarn through that feed dyed with colour ink. As a result, the knitted fabric reveals that there is the dyed track on the thick horizontal lines thereof. A similar experiment was also made on a conventional circular knitting machine which consists of a driving gear and two balance gears all in mesh with the ring gear at three equiangularly spaced positions.The inventor also found that the same number of dyed tracks appeared in the form of the undesirable horizontal lines on the knitted fabric at the positions corresponding the three mesh points, and that the lines appear more noticeable on the side of the driving pinion and less noticeable on the side of the balancing gears. To obtain a further proof thereof, the inventor removed the balancing gears and found that the horizontal lines on the knitted fabric in the sides of Tie balancing gears disappeared.This appears to verify that the undesirable result on knitted fabric is 1 brought about by the vibration originated at be gear mesh points, and the farther the distance from the m sh point is, tie weaker the undesirable horizontal lines Prom the above discoveries, it is evident that the adjustments of the tension of yarns, fabric and the accuracy of the cam position, and so forth can1lot thoroughly solve the problem and only the improvements in the driving and the transmission mechanism of the machine can solve tie problem. Due to the machine structure and the motion of driving mechanism in the conventional circular knitting machine, it is impossible to thoroughly exclude all the vibration or oscillation caused by the movement of the machine, but the vibration can be greatly diminished, if the distance between the power input point i.e. mesh point and the needle cylinder is lengthened or the vibration is evenly distributed on all over the needles whereby the llndesirable horizontal lines can be diminished. A principal object of the invention is to provide an improved circular knitting machine with a new arrangement of driving mechanism for driving the needle cylinder so as to eliminate the undesirable horizontal lines appeared on the knitted fabric caused by the uneven vibrations of the needles point during the machine operation. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved circular knitting machine having centre shafts provided with the cylinder and dial to maintain an accurate centre whereby an even rotation of cylinder and dial can be obtained so as to diminish the undesirable horizontal lines on the fabric. Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved circular knitting machine having the dis1.aiice between the direct power input poiilt or ihe mesh point of driving gear and needle cylinder comparatively lengthened and a vibration dispersing ns further provided whereby the undesirable horizontal lines on the knitted fabric is greatly decreased.

It also comprises a supporting table 13 having a Iiub portion 14 with bearings 19 mounted in the centre thereof and a base plate 15 provided in the bottom of the frame 10. A needle cylinder 20 is fixed onto a rotating disc 21 which has a downwardly extending hollow shaft 22 rotatably inserted in the bearings 19 housed within the hub 14. A rotating wheel 24 is fixed at the lower end of said shaft 22 by its 25 and a key.A vibration dispersing device 30 is provided below the supporting table 13 as show in Figure l and Figure 2, in such a manner that one end is fixed on a supporting frame 16, which is separated from said machine frame 10 and provided for installing the motor D4 and driving means 80 therein. The other end of the device 30 is a ring shape free end 3l fixed to the outer periphery of said hub portion 14 by bolts. A ring gear 40 for driving said rotating wheel 24 through a transmission means is slidably, rotatably mounted on a rail portion 121 of said supporting ring 12. The gear 40 meshes with a driving pinion 41 rotatably supported on a driving shaft 43 at the mesh point 42 and is driven by the driving pinion 41 which is driven by the motor N mounted on said frame 16 through a suitable transmission means 80. At opposed locations on the inner side of said gear 40, there are provided a pair of transmission arms 45 having a pair of radial grooves 44 on their upper surface and a pair of pin shaped free ends 46 on their lower ends.

Beneath the transmission arms 45 there is a knitted fabric take up device 5 provided for winding the knitted fabric into a roll. Said take up device 5 consists of a pair of brackets 51 having a pair of radial grooves 52 on their upper ends corresponding said transmission arms 45 for engaging with said pin ends 46. The downward pin shaped free wends 46 of said transmission aries 45 are radial slidably inserted into the grooves 52 in the like manner as said pin ends 27 of the transmission arms 2 so as to rotate said roller means 5. The driving shaft 43 extends upwardly and passes through said vibration dispersing member 30 and supporting tables 13, 23 so as to drive an automatic yarn feeding device not shown and the dial means 6 shown in dot lines through suitable transmission gears not shown . Said shaft 43 is driven by the motor M not shown mounted on the bottom of said frame 16 via a suitable transmission gears 80. In order to prevent the vibration of the drIv ng shaft 43 affecting said supporting table 13 provided with a cam set 28 thereon, the hole l7 on the supporting table 13, through which said shaft 43 passes, is a little larger in diameter than the shaft 43 to provide a clearance. Only the holes provided on the supporting ring 12 and vibration dispersing member 30 have bearings 18,32 secured within fi em respectively so as to rotatably support said shaft l3. Figures 3 and 4 show a second embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the machine frame 10A consists of a pluralty of legs 11A, a supporting ring 12A and supporting tables 13A,23A similar to those in the first embodiment.Both the rotating disc 21A haviiig a needle cylinder 20A disposed thereon and the rotating plate 67A having a dial 60A disposed thereon are fixed on a common hollow shaft 22A which is rotatably supported between the centre hubs 14A of the upper supporting table 23A shown in dot line and the lower supporting table 13A by means of bearings l9A. When said hollow shaft 22A rotated, both the rotating disc 21A and plate 67A rotate together with said shaft 22A.Upon the plate 67A, a cam device 68A with its lower surface against said dial GOA is mounted on a cam seat 69A which is secured onto the lower end of the downward extending central hub of the upper supporting table 23A.Surrounding said needle cylinder 20A there is a cam device 23A mounted on a lower cam seat which is fixed onto said lower supporting table 13A. Between said plate 67A and said duct 21A, there are an upper and a lower distance adjusting rings 63A and 64A each having a plurality of supporting bars 61A and 62A fixed onto said disc 21A and onto said hollow shaft 22A respectively so as to support said rings 61A,64A in horizontal planes as shown in Figure 4. The upper adjusting ring 63A is a circular ring and concentric with said hollow shaft 22A, while said lower adjusting ring 64A is a heart shaped ring.A cutting knife 66A is provided between said plate 67A and said disc 21A and extends vertically downward whereby the knitted cylindrical fabric is longitudinally cut into a flat one so as to be collected in a bundle form and led into the fabric inlet 65A opened on the side of said hollow shaft 22A at the position opposite to said knife 66A and above said disc 21A. A vibration dispersing member 30A is provided below the table 13A with its free end 31A and root end fixed onto said hub 14A and the frame 16A respectively as in the first embodiment. To further clarify, as the arrows shown in Figure 3 and 4, the cylindrical knitted fabric is vertically cut at a position corresponding to the knife to become a flat one by said cutting knife 66A, and then collected at the cut end to form a bundle, and the bundle of fabric is led downward through said distance adjusting rings 63A,64A to obtain an equal distance from any point on circumference of said adjusting ring 63A to said fabric inlet 65A, finally the bundle like fabric is led out from the lower opening of said hollow shaft 22A and is spread to become a seet like fabric so as to be wound up b take up device 5A. The gear driving means and transmission means below said hollow shaft 22A are the same with the former embodiment, i.e. the shaft 22A is rotatably supported in the bearings 19A disposed in the hub portion 14A of the table 13A affixed onto the lower end of said shaft 22A is the rotating wheel 24A, on the opposite sides of the periphery of which is a pair of transmission arms 26A diametrically disposed. A ring gear 40A is also provided below said rotating wheel 24A and meshes with a driving pinion 41A rotatably mounted inside the groove of said supporting ring 12A via a driving shaft 43A.A pair of transmission arms 45A are disposed on the inside periphery of said ring gear 40A and consist of a pair of radial grooves 44A on their upper ends for engaging with the pin ends 27A of said arms 26A and a pair of pin shape free ends 46A at their lower ends.Below the transmission member 45A, there is the fabric take up device 5A provided with a pair of brackets 51A having a pair of grooves 52A on the upper ends for engaging with the pin ends 46A of said arms 45A. The gear driving and the transmission means is so constructed, when the ring gear 40 is driven to rotate along said supporting ring 12A by said pinion 41A, the rotating disc 21A with provision of the needle cylinder 20A thereon and the rotating plate 67A with provision of said dial 60A thereon rotates steadily through the transmission arms 45A and 26A, rotating wheel 24A and said hollow shaft 22A. In this embodiment, except that both of the rotating disc 21A and rotating plate 67A are fixed onto a central shaft 22A instead of the two corresponding members 21 and 67 being fixed on two separate shafts as in the first embodiment, and that in order to enable he fabric to pass through the space between said disc 21A and plate 67A and to be led into the centre hole of said shaft 22A, there are the provision of the cutting knife 66A, the distance adjusting rings 63A,64A and the fabric inlet 65A, all other elements are the same as the first embodiment. Figure 5 shows a third embodiment of the invention, which is an application of the driving and transmission means of the forst embodiment to a conventional single or double side type circular knitting machine. In this kind of machine, there is no provision of a central shaft 22 and a vibration dispersing device 30 like the first embodiment described above, but the application of the driving and transmission mechanism of this invention to said machine can also obtain a stable and even motion.Therefore the vibration or oscillation can be relatively reduced. In the conventional circular knitting machine, the cylinder member 21B is integrally connected to the ring gear 40B, but in this embodiment, the ring gear 40B is separated from said cylinder 21B. Said gear 40B is rotatably disposed on the supporting ring 12B of the frame 1OB like the manner of the first embodiment and is driven by the driving pinion 41B provided in the supporting ring 12B. The cylinder member 21B is provided with a pair of transmission arms 26B extending downward and having a pair of pins 27B formed at their lower end.A transmission ring 47B, which has a pair of radial grooves 44B provided on its upper surface for engaging with said pins 27B and a pair of transmission arms 45B extending downward therefrom with a pair of pins 46B provided on the free ends for inserting into the grooves 52B of the transmission brackets 51B, is attached to the ring gear 40B rotatably mounted on the supporting ring 12B. A driving pinion 1i1B is fixed on the driving shaft 43B to rotate together with it and meshes with the ring gear 40B at the mesh point 42B. Then the driving pinion 41B rotates with the shaft 43B, the ring gear 40B is driven to rotate on the supporting ring 12B by the pinion 41B. Thus the rotation of the ring gear 40B is transmitted to the cylinder 21B and the fabric take up device 5B. The difference between this embodiment and the first embodiment is that the cylinder 21B also functions as a rotating wheel, therefore, there is no separate rotating wheel 24 such as in the first embodiment. As regard to other parts and portions, they are structurally same as in a conventional machine, so they are omitted from the drawings and the description. Figure 6 shows a fourth embodiment of this invention. In this embodiment, instead of the ring gear 40 being mounted on the supporting ring as in the first embodiment, a gear wheel 40C with a bearing 46C in its centre is used and rotatably supported in the centre of the base plate 15C at the bottom of the machine frame 100. The gear wheel 40C meshes with the driving pinion 41C at the mesh point 42C and is driven by the driving pinion 41C.A rotating wheel 24C fixed to the lower end of the holly shaft 22C is driven by the gear wheel 40C Through a transmission member which consists of a pair of upper transmission arms 26C fixed on the rotating wheel 24C and a pair of lower transmission arms 51C fixed on the gear wheel 40C. These arms are connected to each other by pins 27C and grooves 52C at their connecting ends. Because the driving means consisting of a motor M, driving pinion 41C and gear 40e are located on the bottom frame 15C, if the power is to be directly transmitted to the upper gear provided for driving the dial device and the automatic yarn feeding device, the transmission distance will be too long and the driving shaft also must be extended upward from the bottom of the frame and become ineffective from the point of dynamics. Therefore, the rotating wheel 2 C is formed as a gear wheel and meshes with a pinion ,0 fIxed on the shaft 43C.The shaft 43C functions as the extension of the driving shaft 43 in the first embodiment to drive the dial device and yarn feeding device provided on the upper supporting table 23C of the frame 10C. In another embodiment, the gear 40C used in the fourth embodiment is omitted. To drive the rotating disc 21C, the rotating gear wheel 24C, which is originally a driving gear now becomes a driven gear, and is directly driven bv the pinion 70 which is originally a driven pinion and now becomes a driving pinion and is driven bv the motor M through a suitable transmission device 80C. Thus both of the rotating disc 21C provided the needle cylinder 20C thereon and the transmission arms 26C,D1C for supporting the fabric take up device 5C are driven by the gear 240. Figure 7 shows the fifth embodiment of this invention. In this embodiment, the gear 40B and the driving means for drive the gear 40B originally located on the intermediate supporting frame 13B are removed onto the upper supporting frame 23D where they are shown as gear 40D and pinion 41D other parts or portions are the same with the third embodiment as shown in Figure 5. The gear 40D is rotatably mounted on the upper end of a centre shaft 601 of the rotating disc 21D and the motor M is mounted on the supporting bracket 13E fixed upon the upper supporting table 23D.The gear 40D is driven by the motor M through a transmission means such as belt and pulley transmission 80D and a pinion 41D. When the gear 40D rotates, the rotating plate 67D provided with dial device 60D thereon follows the rotation through the shaft 601, and the cylinder 20D is driven by the rotating plate 67D through one or more roller transmission devices 29 shown in more detail in Figures 8 and 9. As shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, the or each roller transmission device 29 comprises two rollers 29A and 29B pivoted upon two stationary eccentric shafts 294 which are integrally formed and are fixed onto an upper supporting plate 291 secured onto the bottom surface of said dial plate 60D, a driving roller 29C and a braking roller 29D respectively disposed at opposite sides of said to rollers 29A,29B, said rollers 29C and 29D being respectively pivoted on to shafts 295,296 which are fixed onto two lower supporting plates 292,293 respectively. Said two plates 292,293 are adjustable mounted on the upper surface of said cylinder 20D.There is a small clearance provided between the transmission roller 29A and the driving roller 29C and likewise a small clearance is provided between the transmission roller 29B and the braking roller 29D.Since said to rollers 29A,29B are respectively provided on said eccentric shafts 294, the knitting fabric, flowing down from the clearance formed between the dial 60D and needle cylinder 20D, may pass through said clearance between the rollers and flow thereunder. Tiring the rotation of the rotating plate 67D, said two rollers 29A,29B are rotated as shown by arrows in Figure 8 and 9. Therefore, in addition to a function for said dial plate 67D to have a synchronous rotation, said roller transmission device 29 has another function for knitting fabric to pass therethrough. Since the conventional roller transmission device thereof comprises four sets of driving rollers and one set of braking roller. It is found that five undesired vertical lines will be brought about on the knitted fabric, due to the friction contact between the rollers. However, only t io vertical lines will occur on the fabric if only a single roller transmission device 29 is used. In order to ensure the good appearance and quality of the knitted fabric, one simple wav can be adopted and so obtain a good result by longitudinally cutting the circular knitted fabric along the central line between said undesirable vertical lines by a vertical knife to make the fabric become a flat one, thus the position of the undesirable vertical lines are on two longitudinal edges of the knitted fabric and do not affect the fabric. The above description of various embodiments are most for the doubt knit type circular knitting machines. However the only difference between single knit type and double knit type is that the former comprises a needle cylinder and a dial device, while the later comprises only a needle cylinder and no dial device and the related mechanism provided thereon. Therefore, this invention can be applied to both of single lsnit tpe and double knit type circular knitting machines. In this invention, because of the mesh point of the gears is removed from near the needle cylinder to a much farther location, and the rotation of needle cylinder is stabilized by the rotating wheel and the self centre alignable transmission device, especially in the first and second embodiments, the rotating plate and disc supporting needle cylinders thereon have a central shaft supported in the centre of supporting tables, so that they are provided with steady supporting and also aligned on the same axis, enabling the knitting machine to diminish vibrations caused by the imbalance at the powder input point, at the same time to disperse the vibration evenly to the needle points. The combined effects prevent the undesirable horizontal lines on the knitted fabrics, and upgrade quality and the value of the products.
