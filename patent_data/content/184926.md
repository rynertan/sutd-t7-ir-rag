# Panels of microporous thermal insulation.

## Abstract
A panel of microporous thermal insulation which com prises an envelope of glass fibre cloth 1 which surrounds and is bonded to a block of microporous thermal insulation is manufactured by heating 2 the glass fibre cloth 1 so as to drive off organic material, applying a silane in an acidic solution 3 to the cloth, drying 4 the cloth 1 in order to produce cross linking of the silane so as to cause the cloth to stiffen, and ap plying to the cloth an aqueous solution of particulate silica, an aqueous solution of sodium silicate or potassium silicate, or a cellulose solution 5 . Microporous thermal insulation is in troduced into a bag made from the cloth and the bag is then compressed to consolidate the insulating material and to produce a bond between the insulating material and the bag.
