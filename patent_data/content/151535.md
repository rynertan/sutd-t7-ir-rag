# Control system for an infinitely variable transmission including a lubricating means.

## Abstract
A control system for an infinitely variable belt drive transmission which has a drive pulley 36 having a hyd raulically shiftable disc 36b and a servo chamber 38b for shifting the disc, a driven pulley 37 having a hydraulically shiftable disc 37b and a servo chamber 39a for shifting the disc, and a belt 34 engaged with both the pulleys. A hydraulic control circuit is provided for supplying oil to the servo chambers 38b, 39a and for draining the servo chambers. A lubricating oil circuit is provided in the hyd raulic control circuit for supplying lubricating oil to the drive pulley 36 , and a passage 115 is provided for supplying a part of the lubricating oil to the servo chamber 38b of the drive pulley 36 , thereby filling the servo chamber 38b with the oil before the starting of transmission operation.
