# Peroxide compositions based on tungsten and phosphorus or arsenic, and a process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
There are described compositions of formula Q₃XW₄O Such compositions may be prepared by reacting an oxy genated tungsten VI derivative, an oxygenated P V or As V derivative and hydrogen peroxide, in an aqueous acid phase, with a onium salt or a precursor thereof, optionally contained in an organic phase immiscible with the aqueous phase, at sub stantially room temperature. The oxygenated compounds of W VI , P V or As V may be prepared in situ under the conditions of the reaction. Compositions I , which may be solids or viscous oils, find use as oxidizing agents in general in oxidation processes, and especially as epoxydation catalysts for olefinic compounds.
