# Polycondensates of substituted piperidines and use thereof as stabilizers for polymers.

## Abstract
Polycondensates of N,N bis 2,2,6,6 tetra alkyl 4 piperidyl alkylene diamine with aza malonic acid are useful for stabilizing thermoplastic polymers, in particular polyolefins, against sunlight, heat and oxidation.
