# Toner loading cartridge.

## Abstract
A toner cartridge for replenishing toner in a reproducing machine which may be readily inserted in an opening in a toner dispenser, includes a base plate 51 and a toner hopper 52 slidably engaged with the loop of the base plate, both the base plate and the toner hopper having a plurality of apertures 57, 71 therein for toner to pass therethrough into the toner dispenser when in the open position. The base plate 51 of the toner cartridge has a hook at one end adapted to lock under the lip of the toner dispenser opening when the cartridge is inserted in it, and the toner hopper has a hook 68 at the opposite end adapted to lock under the lip of the toner dispenser opening when the toner hopper is slidably moved from the closed position to the open position. In the closed position portions 56 of the base plate provide a seal under the apertures 71 in the toner hopper and when the toner hopper is slidably moved to the open position, the apertures 57 71 in the base plate and toner hopper are aligned permitting toner to fall into the toner dispenser. A preferred toner hopper comprises a plurality of bins 69 each with a plurality of inclined sides 70 defining a chute which terminates in the plurality of apertures 71 in the bottom of the toner hopper. With this structure the toner cartridge dispenses toner only when it is locked in position in the dispenser and is removable from the dispenser only when in the closed position.
