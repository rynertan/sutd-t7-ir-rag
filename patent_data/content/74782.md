# Butterfly valve.

## Abstract
A fire safe butterfly valve provides bi directional sealing. In normal duties a polymeric seal 26 provides forward and reverse sealing against the edge 4 of the valve disc 1 , the polymeric seal 26 being resiliently loaded in the axial direction of the valve by a resilient metal ring 5 . The metal ring 5 provides a bi directional seal with the disc edge 4 in the event of destruction of the polymeric seal 26 by fire. The metal ring 5 is transverse cross section consists of an arm 19 having a curved radially inner end 6 presenting a convex surface 21 for engagement with the disc edge 4 . For fluid pressure acting from the smaller diameter side of the disc 1 , in the burnt out condition, the curvature of the radially inner end 6 of the metal ring 5 gives rise to an increased sealing force with the disc edge 4 as the disc 7 moves in response to the fluid pressure and the ring inner end remains in rolling contact with the disc edge 4 .
