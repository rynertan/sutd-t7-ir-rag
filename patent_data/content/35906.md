# Selectively light transmitting laminated structure.

## Abstract
A selectively light transmitting laminated structure has a substracte layer A of a transparent sheet like structure, bearing an infra red wave reflective layer D having a thickness of 50 to 300 Å comprising silver metal, a transparent thin layer B₁ having a high refractive index between layers A and D and or a transparent thin layer B₂ having a high refractive index on layer D , and optionally a transparent top layer E on layer B₂ if present or layer D with a layer C having a thickness of 3 to 100 Å and deposited as a material selected from Ti, Zr, In, Si, C, Co and Ni being provided on layer D in contact therewith on the opposite side thereof to layer A . Such laminates can be used in windows of buildings and in greenhouses.
