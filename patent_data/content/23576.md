## Description
7 AND 7 8 SUBSTITUTED 4,5t EPOXYMORPHINAN 6 ONE COMPOUNDS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION Certain well known narcotic analgesics belong to the class of 4,Sa epoxymorphinan compounds which have the following basic ring system, in which the atoms are numbered as indicated.EMI1.1 The two most familiar compounds of this class arc morphine and its 3 methyl ether, codeine, with the structures indicated below.EMI1.2 Morphine Codeine When the 6 hydroxyl group of each of these com pounds is oxidized.to an oxo.group, the compounds con veniently are referred.to as morphinone and codeinonc, respectively. When the N methyl groups of the latter compounds are replaced by other substituent groups they may be referred to as N substituted normorphinones and norcodeinones, respectively. There are two types of nomenclature commonly used for describing compounds herein. The trivial names, such as morphine or morph inone, are widely accepted and used for the sake of brevity and clarity. The Chemical Abstracts nomenclature is preferred and is used wherever precision is needed. In structural formulae depicting these compounds, a dashed line is used to represent a covalent bond projecting below the plane of the reference atom a configuration while a wedged or heavily accented line B configura tion signifies a covalent bond above such plane. Morphine and its relatives are used primarily for the relief of pain i.e., as analgesics . They are narcotic and possess dependence inducing ability and produce other side effects that make them less than idcal analgesics emesis, constipation, sweating, respiratory depressions, miosis . A compound with the appropriate profile of analgesic agonist and narcotic antagonist actions which is not morphine like has potential as an analgesic agent for treatment of moderate to severe pain without liability of drug dependence PRIOR ART The only known 4,5a epoxymorphinan compounds possessing substituents other than a hydrogen atom in the 8 position are those with a halogen, nitrogen or oxygen atom at C 8.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention involves 7 and 7 8 substituted 4,5a epoxymorphinan 6 one compounds characterized by the structural formula EMI9.1 wherein R is cyclopropylmethyl or cyclobutylmethyl andR is H or ss methyl provided that when R is cyclopropylmethyl, R is H and when R is cyclobutylmethyl R is methyl. The 7 substituted compounds which are claimed in this patent application differ from the known analgesic agents dihydromorphinan and dihydrocodeinone and the mixed narcotic angonist antagonists, N cyclopropylmethyl dihydrocodeinone and dihydromorphinone, by the presence of a methyl group in the 7a position and optionally, in the case of TR 5430, a methyl group in the 8B position. One compound of this series, 7a methyl N cyclopropylmethyl dihydromorphinone l7 cyclopropylmethyl 4,5a epoxy 3 hydroxy 7a methylmorphinan 6 one, TR 5402 has an especially useful agonist antagonist potency ED50 0.42, AD50 1.63 . The preparation of those compounds which are generally characterized by Formula I is described by Scheme I andExample 1 which follow. Referring to Scheme I, thebaine 12 is reacted with lithium dimethyl cuprate to yield 3, 6 dimethoxy 7ss,17 dimethyl 4 hydroxy 5,6,8,14 tetradehydro morphinane 13 which is hydrolyzed to a mixture of B C cis and trans a, ss unsaturated ketones 14 and 15. The minor product of this reaction, the B C trans compound 15 will not undergo ring closure and is most conveniently separated from the desired Cis isomer 14 at this stage by chromatography. Compound 14 is then reduced to the 7a methyl derivative 16a by catalytic means or reacted with lithium dimethyl cuprate to give 16b.The introduction of the 8 methyl group requires an excess of the organo copper reagent 2.5 equivalents over that normally needed 1.25 equivalents to effect conjugate addition to codeinone. The 17 methyl group is displaced with a cyano function using conditions similar to those known in the art, except, that in order to obtain a clean conversion to the cyano compound 17, an excess of cyanogen bromide must be utilized 2.4 verses 1.25 equivalents . Hydrolysis to the nor compounds 18 proceeds normally in refluxing 2N HC1. The nor compounds 18 are alkylated using cyclopropylmethyl or cyclobutylmethyl bromide under standard reaction conditions to give 19. The treatment of compounds 19 with two equivalents of bromine in glacial acetic acid yields the intermediate l bromo 58 bromo compound 20 which is not isolated. This intermediate, in chloroform solution, is treated with cold dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide.The anion of the 4 hydroxy group displaces the 5ss broaine in an SN2 fashion resulting in closure of the 4,5 epoxy bond to give 21. The desired compounds 21 are isolated by chromatography in about 50 yield. Other higher brominated analogs are the major contaminating products. Compounds 21 are debrominated by hydrogenation in aqueous buffer utilizing conditions similar to those described by Rapoport, J. Med. Chem., 9 1171, 1976 , ie, aqueous sodium acetate buffer at pH X 4.5. Hydrogenation in neutral or acidic solution leads to substantial quantities of ring cleaved product 19. The 3 methoxy group of 22 can be cleaved to give the 3 phenol 23 in low to moderate yields by use of boron tribromide. The major coptaminant in this reaction is a 4,5 epoxy cleaved product which again reflects the liability of the.epoxy..bond.

PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION The compounds whose preparation is disclosed in the foregoing examples were screened to determine tic following biological activities A Analgesic effects upon mice acetic acid writhing test . B Narcotic antagonist activity in rats modified rat tail flick test . TEST A. ACETIC ACID MOUSE WRITHING l ES I The analgesic effects of test compounds were determined in mice by use of the acetic acid writhing test described by B.J.R. Whittle, Brit. J. Pharmacol., 22 246 1964 . In this test at least three groups of five male CD 1 mice 18 22 g each were given subcutaneous doses of the test drug dissolved in either distilled water or distilled water acidified with llCl depending on the solubility of the compound. In all cases, 0.4 milliliter of a 0.5 V V acetic acid in distilled water solution was administered intraperi toneally 15 minutes post tlrug. The number of writhes in a 20 min. interval beginning 5 minutes after the acetic acid injection were determined and compared with the number of writhes in control groups which had received only acetic acid. Percent inhibition of writhing was calculated as inhibition No. Control writhes No. treated writlis No. control writhes X 1 The ED50 dose, i.e., the dose required to rcduce the number of writhes by 50 , was determined graphically from a plot of inhibition as a probit versus log dose.Confidence limits of 95 were calculated on the hasis of those results falling in the range 16 84 inhihition.See Litchfield, J.T. and Wilcoxon, F., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 96, 99 113, 1949 .TEST B. EVALUATION OF NARCOTIC ANTAGONIST ACTIVIfY The narcotic antagonist effects of test compounds were determined by a modification of the rat tail flick procedure of Harris and Pierson J. Pharmacol. Ixp. Iller. 143,141 1964 . Male albino Wistar rats 100 120 g were used for this study. A rat s tail is so placed so.as to cover a photoccll. Heat is applied by a lainp in a rcflector with a timer being connected to tlic lamp aiid photocell so that the timer goes on when the licht is turned on and is turned off when the photocell is uiicovered. A rheostat, incorporated into a heating lamp is used to adjust the intensity of the light falling on the. tail of the rat such that the rat s control reaction time is from two to four seconds. Animals with a control reaction time outside this range are rejected. The rheostat adjustment is made only if a significant proportion more than 2 out of every 10 rats of the reaction times are outside the range of two to our seconds. Groups of five rats were used each time, and two control times were detcrru cd at 60 and 30 minutes prior to subcutaneous injection of the drug. A ten second cutoff time is employed if the rat does not flick its tail in 10 seconds it is removed from the heat source. Thirty minutes after the last control run the test drug was given intraperitoneally. This was followed ten minutes later by an ED80 dose of morphine subcutaneously. The animals were retested at 20 minutes after the morphine injection. Control animals were given vehicle and morphine only. The data were calculated as follows MRT Treated MRT Control x 100 Effect E . 10 MRT Control E morphine controls E drug treated x 100 Antagonism E morphine control MRT is defined as mean reaction time. The data were plotted on log probit paper andAD50 values, i.e., the dose required to inhibit the morphine effect by 50 within 95 confidence limits, were determined by the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon. The results of these experiments are set out inTable I where R and R refer to the preceeding Formula I for the compounds of the present invention. In the column under R , CEM stands for cyclobutylmethyl and CPM for cyclopropylmethyl. For purposes of this table, IA is intended to mean inactive at the dose indicated.
