# COLOUR MEMBER AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SAME

## Abstract
A colour member comprises a substrate 6 , an electro conductive member 7 on the substrate and a coloured layer 8 on the electroconductive member. The electroconductive member consists of a first electroconductive layer 7a on the substrate 6 and a second electroconductive layer 7b on the first electroconductive layer. The second electroconduc tive layer is made of an electroconductive material resistant to the reaction products of electrolysis of water and has the coloured layer 8 thereon.
