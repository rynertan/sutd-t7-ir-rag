Among compounds of the general formula I obtainable according to the process of this invention, the one having an ethyl group for R in said formula I is generally called phthalazinol. This compound has pharmacological activities such as cyclic QEP phosphodiesterase inhibiting action and platelet agsreg√Öation inhibiting action and its medicinal application for the treatment of sensory disturbance caused by cerebral stroke or central pain is anticipated. The 3 dichloromethylenephthalide derivatives of the general formula III andthe.4 dichloromethyl 1 phthalazone derivatives of the general formula IV obtained according to this invention are novel compounds not found in the literature. As a result of extensive researches for a more advantageous preparation process for phthalazinol, the present inventors had previously developed a method using as starting materials a compound of formula II and a triphenylphosphorane derivative U.S. PatentSpecification No. 4,350,813 , Further studies have led the present inventors to the findings that a 3 dichloromethylenephthalide derivative of formula III can be obtained in a high yield, with substantially no by production of a positional isomer, i.e., 5 alkoxycarbonyl 4, 6 dimethylphthalide represented by the general formula EMI4.1 wherein R is as defined above, by reacting a phthalic anhydride derivative of formula II with triphenylphosphine in carbon tetrachloride that a reaction of said 3 dichloromethylenephthalide derivative with a hydrazine can easily afford a 4 dichloromethylphthalazone derivative of formula IV in a high yield that this 4 dichloromethylphthalazone derivative, when hydrolyzed, is easily converted into a 4 formyl l phthalazone derivative of formula V and that this 4 formyl l phthalazone derivative can be reduced to give a 4 hydroxymethyl 1 phthalazone derivative ofthe general formula I .. The present invention was attained on the basis of these findings. According to the process of this invention, it is possible to obtain objective compounds of formula I from compounds of formula II in four steps and all the starting materials necessary for the process are easily available, so that this process is an excellent industrial method for the preparation of said objective compounds. The 4 fo rmyl l phthalazon e derivatives represented by formula V have been hitherto synthesized by oxidizing 4 hydroxymethyl l phthalazone derivatives represented by formula I U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 4,182,876 , so that they were of no value at all as an intermediate in the preparation of the compounds of formula I including phalazinol. The present invention has afforded them a usefulness as an intermediate for the first time. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The process of this invention is a sequence of reactions represented by the following scheme EMI6.1 where R s in formulae I to V are each an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl, n pentyl, isopentyl, n hexyl, isohexyl and the like, The step a in the process of this invention is accomplished by reacting triphenylphosphine with a phthalic anhydride derivative of formula II in carbon tetrachloride or in a solvent containing the same. As typical examples of the phthalic anhydride derivatives of formula II used as a starting material in step a , the following may be cited 4 ethoxycarbo nyl , 5 di methylphthali c anhydrid e 4 methoxycarbonyl 3, 5 dimethylphthalic anhydride 4 n propoxycarbonyl 3, 5 dimethylphthalic anhydride 4 n butoxyc arbonyl 3, 5 di methylphthali c anhydri de As the solvent used for the reaction in step a , it is most desirable to use carbon tetrachloride which serves as a reactant at the same time, but one may also use an organic solvent which takes no part in the reaction. Among the organic solvents usable for this purpose are aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, toluene, or benzene, ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxane, esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, or methyl acetate, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, or trichloroethylene, amides such as dimethylformamide, or dimethylacetamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide. The amount of triphenylphosphine used in step a is not subject to any specific restrictions except that it should not be less than 2 equivalents to the phthalic anhydride derivative of formula II , but it is desirable that triphenylphosphine is used in an amount of 2 to 4 equivalents to said phthalic anhydride derivative. The amount of carbon tetrachloride may be also arbitrarily selected provided that it is not less than one equivalent to the compound of formula II , but it is desirable that the amount of carbon tetrachloride used is at least 5 equivalents, more preferably 5 to 100 equivalents to the compound of formula it . The reaction can be accomplished at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of a solvent used, but it is preferred to perform the reaction at a temperature from 50 0C to the boiling point of the solvent used. The reaction is usually completed in 3 to 24 hours0 To isolate a 3 dichloromethylenephthalide derivative of formula III from the reaction mixed ture,the. ixtne is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is dissolved in a small quantity of a mixed solvent consisting of benzene and hexane. The obtained solution is passed through a silica gel column and eluted with a benzene hexane mixed solvent.The fraction containing the objective substance is collected and concentrated under reduced pressure. The step b in the process of this invention is performed by reacting a hydrazine with a 3 dichloromethylenephthalide derivative of formula III obtained in step a in a solvent. Examples of compounds of formula III used as a starting material in this step b are those mentioned above. As for the hydrazine used as another starting material, no specific restrictions are imposed to this C reactant and it is possible to use either hydrazine or a hydrazine hydrate or a hydrous hydrazine hydrate. The solvent used in this step b is also not subject to any particular restrictions provided that it is an inert solvent. The following substances may be used as the solvent in step b aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, or xylene, halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, trichloroethane, tetrachloroethane, or trichloroethylene, ethers such as diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxane, esters such as ethyl acetate or n butyl acetate, ketones such as acetone, ethyl methyl ketone, or isobutyl methyl ketone, amides such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile and the like. The amount of the hydrazine used in this step may be arbitrarily selected provided that it is at least one equivalent to 3 dichloromethylenephthalide derivative of formula III , but usually it is desirable that the hydrazine is used in an amount of 2 to 10 equivalents. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of a solvent used, but usually it is preferred to conduct the reaction around the boiling point of a solvent by using a solvent having a boiling point of 800C or higher. The reaction is usually completed in 3 to 24 hours. A 4 dichloromethyl l phthalazone derivative of formula IV may be isolated from the reaction mixture by concentrating themi tlrR under reduced pressure, dissolving the residue in a small quantity of a mixed solvent of benzene and ethyl acetate, passing the mixed solution through a silica gel column, eluting it with a benzene ethyl acetate mixed solvent, collecting a fraction containing the objective substance and concentrating the fraction under reduced pressure. Typical examples of the 4 dichloromethyl l phthalazone derivatives of formula IV obtainable in the manner described above are 7 ethoxycarbonyl 4 dichloromethyl 6,8 dimethyl 1 phthalazone 7 methoxycarbonyl 4 dichloromethyl 6, 8 dimethyl l phthalazone 7 n propoxycarbonyl 4 di chlo romethyl 6 ,8 dime thyl l phthalazone 7 n butoxycarbonyl 4 dichl r methyl 6s8 dimeth phthalazone. The hydrolysis constituting step c of this invention is accomplished by reacting an acid or a base with the 4 di chloromethyl l phthalazone derivative of formula IV obtained in step b in a solvent. Examples of compounds IV used as a starting material for step c are those mentioned above. The acid used in this step may be either an inorganic or an organic acid. Examples of the inorganic acids usable in this step are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and examples of the organic acids are lower fatty acids such as formic acid acetic acid, or propionic acid, and sulfonic acids such as benzenesulfonic acid, toluene sulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or ethanesulfonic acid, and the like. As for the base used in this step, it may be also either an inorganic or an organic base. Exemplary of the inorganic bases usable are hydroxides, carbonates or hydrogen carbonates of sodium and potassium, oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of calcium, and the like, and examples of the organic bases are triethylamine, pyridine, N methylmorpholine, alkali metal salts of lower fatty acids such as sodium formate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, or sodium propionate, and the like. The solvent used in this step may be of any type provided that the compounds of formula IV are soluble therein if slightly, but it is desirable to use water or an organic solvent or a mixture thereof. Any type of organic solvent may be used provided that it is miscible with water. For instance, one may use alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or n butanol, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or isobutyl methyl ketone, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, amides such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, lower fatty acids such as formic acid, acetic acid or propionic acid, pyridine, and the like. When an alkali metal salt of a fatty acid is used as a hydrolyzing agent and a fatty acid as a solvent, part of the 4 dichloromethyl l phthalazone derivative of formula IV used as a starting material is converted into a 4 diacyloxy methyl 7 alkoxycarbonyl 6,8 di methyl l phthalazone represented by the general formula EMI13.1 wherein R1 is a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, and R is as defined above, and this compound is in turn converted into a 4 formyl l phthalazone derivative of formula V in the course of the hydrolysis. The amount of the acid used is not specifically defined provided that it is at least 0.1 equivalent to the compound of formula IV , but preferably it is 1 to 100 equivalents to said compound. The base is also not specified in its amount provided that it is at least 2 equivalents to the compound of formula IV . It is however desirable that the base is used in an amount of 2 to 100 equivalents to the compound of formula IV . The reaction can be accomplished at a temperature between room temperature and the boiling point of a solvent used, and it is usually completed in 30 minutes to 24 hours. Since usually crystals of the objective substance are precipitated in the reaction mixture , the isolation of the compound of formula V from the mixture can be easily effectuated by filtering out the crystals. The 4 formyl l phthalazone derivatives of formula V which can be obtained in the manner described above include the following 7 ethoxycarbonyl 6 ,8 dime thyl 4 formyl l phthalazone 7 methOxycarbonyl 6,8 dimethyl 4 formyl 1 phthalazone 7 n propOxycarbonyl 6,8 dimethyl 4 formyl 1 phWhalazone 7 n butoxycarbonyl 6 ,8 dime thyl 4 fo rmyl l phthalazone The step d , or the reduction, in the process of this invention can be accomplished by employing a known method for converting an aldehyde into an alcohol, for ,example, catalytic reduction by use of a metal catalyst, reduction by a metal hydride or reduction by an acid and a metal. The catalytic reduction by use of a metal catalyst can be conducted in a solvent in the presence of a metal catalyst in a hydrogen atmosphere under normal pressure or under pressure. Any type of metal catalyst may be used as far as it can reduce the formyl group to a hydroxymethyl group, but preferred catalysts are palladiums such as palladium black, palladium carbon, palladium barium sulfate, or palladium calcium carbonate, various types of active Raney nickels, platinum or its compounds such as platinum dioxide, rhodium and its derivatives. The amount of the catalyst to be used is not specifically defined, but if is preferred that the amount is 0.01 to 100 based on the weight of the material to be reduced. The solvent used in this reduction step may be arbitrarily selected provided that such solvent takes no part in the reaction and is capable of dissolving the material to be reduced. The preferred solvents are lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol or isopropanol, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane or bis 2 methoxyethoxy ether diglyme , esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate or n butyl acetate, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid or propionic acid, amides such as dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and the like, or a mixture of any of said solvents with water. The reduction temperature is not specified but preferably selected from the range of o to 1000C. The reaction is usually completed in one to 24 hours. The isolation of a 4 hydroxymethyl l phthalazone derivative represented by the general formula I from the reaction mixture can be easily accomplished by filtering off the catalyst, concentrating the filtrate under reduced pressure and, if necessary, recrystallizing the product from a suitable solvent, for example, 50 aqueous acetone. The reduction by use of a metal hydride can be attained by the action of a metal hydride on a compound of formula V in a solvent. No specific restrictions are imposed on the metal hydride to be used for the reduction, but alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts of boron hydride are preferred and, among them, sodium borohydride is particularly preferred. The amount of the metal hydride to be used for the reduction may be arbitrarily selected provided that it is not less than the theoretical amount for the substance to be reduced, but usually it is desirable that the amount is 1.2 to 2 times the theoretical. As for the solvent used for this reduction, it is possible to employ all the solvents cited as usable in the catalytic reduction except for the carboxylic acids.The reaction temperature may be arbitrarily selected between 0 C and the boiling point of a solvent used, and the reaction is completed in usually 1 to 24 hours.The isolation of a 4 hydroxymethyl l phthalazone of formula I from the reaction mixture can be easily accomplished by concentrating the mixture under reduced pressure, adding dilute hydrochloric acid to the residue, filtering out precipitated crystals and, if necessary, recrystallizing them with a suitable solvent such as 50 aqueous acetone. The reduction by use of an acid and a metal can be accomplished by adding a metal powder in a solvent containing an acid. Both inorganic and organic acids may be used for this reduction. Preferred examples of the inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and the like, and preferred examples of the organic acids are acetic acid, propionic acid, benzene sulfuric acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid and the like. The acid amount needs be enough for maintaining the acidity of the reaction solution but is not specifically defined otherwise. Any metal that is capable of producing hydrogen upon reaction with the acid may be used, but zinc, iron, tin and the like are preferred.The amount of the metal to be used for the reduction may be arbitrarily selected above the theoretical amount, but it is desirable that the amount is 2 to 100 times the theoretical for bringing the reaction to completion.As for the solvent used for this reduction, all the solvents cited as usable in the catalytic reduction may be employed. The reaction temperature may be arbitrarily selected preferably between OOC and the boiling point of a solvent used, and the reaction is completed usually in 1 to 24 hours. The isolation of a 4 hydroxymethyl lphthalazone of formula I from the reaction mixture can be accomplished in the same way as in the case of reduction using a metal catalyst. The phthalic anhydride derivatives of formula II usable as a starting material in this invention are known compounds see Japanese Patent Laid Open No.27153 1980 and can be easily synthesized from ethyl isodehydroacetate and dichloromaleic anhydride.
