# PACKAGING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system of packaging provides two or more intercon nected containers A, B, C in which articles are retained and the containers can be separated from one another to gain access to the articles. The packaging is assembled from elements each includ ing a male and female tubular member 10 and 11 intercon nected by frangible connecting means 22. Male members are engaged with female members to assemble a chain of con tainers which pivot relative to one another. Separation of the connecting means to release a contain er enables the members 10 and 11 to be twisted relative to one another to gain access to the article.
