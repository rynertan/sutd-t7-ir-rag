## Description
EANI A3LE SCREW SECURING DEVICE This invention relates to a screw securing device, and more particularly to a screw securing device having a metal shield formation which ia caused to expand by the translation of a cone produced by threading in a screw0 Known are securing devices with metal shields, the component parts whereof are formed by casting. Thus, the possibility is afforded for obtaining shapes of any types, but production costs are particularly high, and the output low. Also known are securing devices having shields formed by shearing from sheet metal which is then folded over to produce a cylindrical body. In the expansion due to the cone, the shield is opened up and deformed permanently without any chance of recovering elastically its shape on loosening the expanding cone. Also known are securing devices with a shield fabricated in several segments held together by a spring such as front hood spring or by elastic elements which tie the shield at several points. Such securing devices have particularly high manufacturing costs particularly in the former instance for the fabrication of the elastic element, while in the latter instance the elastic tying elements provide the structure with no satisfactory elasticity. It is a primary object of this invention to provide a robust and reliable securing device having a shield formation of steel or other materials . A consequent primary object is that of providing a shielding formation assembled simply by an elastic element which also produces a reaction to the expansion caused by the cone. A further object is to provide a securing device made up of few parts to be obtained by simple machining, with a minimum of wasted material, and without hot processing. Still another object is to provide a shielding formation which secures the expander cone, preventing both its separation and rotation as the screw is being threaded in. A not unimportant object is to provide a securing device wherein the shielding component parts fit properly side by side with contact surfaces which favor a stable assembly position. The proposed objects are achieved by a securing device characterized in that it comprises a shield formation including at least two equal segments formed, for example, by shearing and pressing from sheet metal, said shield formation defining a tubular body to the rear end whereof an expander cone is hooked which cooperates with a screw extending through said tubular body, said shield formation also having a depressed annular seat in the proximity of the front portion of the shield formation, said seat accommodating a spring having preferably several turns and being adapted to hold the segments together in the shield formation and to react elastically to the expansion thereof as caused by the insertion of an expander cone. Expediently, also provided are a means of engagement between the expander cone and shield formation, and a front bushing inserted into the tubular body and cooperating with said spring to hold the various parts together. The segments which make up the shield formation are shaped such as to produce a mating of the side byside fitting edges thereof, mating which is adapted to improve the holding in the assembled form. Further features and advantages may be inferred from the detailed description of a preferred embodiment given herein by way of illustration and not of limitation with reference to the accompanying drawing sheets, where Figure 1 is a general side view of the securing device according to the invention Figure 2 is a partly sectional view of the expander cone Figure 3 shows a shield segment as sectioned along its longitudinal centerline Figure 4 is a view of the assembling spring Figure 5 shows one of the segments which make up the shield Figure 6 is a front view of the combination of three segments making up the shield and Figure 7 is a partly sectional view of the screw securing device bringing out an assembling bushing. With reference to the drawing figures, the securing device of this invention comprises, in the embodiment shown, a shield formation, generally indicated at 1 and comprising three equal metal segments, indicated respectively at 2,3, and 4. The three segments have approximately the shape of portions of a cylindrical surface and are formed, for example, by shearing and pressing from sheet metal of a suitable thickness. Each of them has, as shown best in Figures 3 and 5, a broad area 5 with a convex surface which may be possibly machined to cling to the walls of the hole into which the screw securing device is to be inserted, separated from a smaller front area 6 by a depressed area 7 formed by cold pressing in the steel sheet which comprises each segment. At the rear or innermost end of the metal segment, referring to the inserted condition of the securing device into a hole, an inner hook 8 is provided formed during the same pressing operation which also provides the depressed area 7, adapted to hook on an expander cone 9 including a frusto conical area 10 provided with an axial threaded hole 11, said frusto conical area 10 extending into an annular channel 12 which forms a hook on abutment 13 where said hook 8 is inserted. Also provided on the expander cone 9 are flattened areas 14 equal in number to the identical metal segments which make up the shield. Said faced areas 14 facilitate the slipping movement of the inclined faces 15 continuing the hook 8 and are also formed during a pressing operation. Said indentical metal segments 2,3 and 4 have, at the end interfering with the cone 9, bevels 16 adapted to facilitate the slipping of the cone 9 into the shield 1 without excessive friction or tripping. A multiple turn spring 17 is positioned in the depressed area 7 and has the function of holding together the three identical metal segments 2,3 and 4 and of reacting elastically during the expansion of the same as a result of the insertion of the cone 9 effected by threading a screw 18 in. The depressed area 7 has, at one of its edges, a sheared part 19 which allows folding over of an edge of the shield so as to obtain a turned out wing 20 having the function of preventing the rotation of the securing device by interference with the walls of the hole whereinto the securing device will be inserted. The metal segments 2,3 and 4 which make up the shield are formed1 as mentioned, e.g. by shearing off a sheet of metal which is then folded over. If this opera tion Was effected to obtain perfect cylindrical portion, the side by side fitting edges of the various segments would present themselves in their thickness with an angle to each other and not mating. For this reason, each segment, as viewed in section as shown in Figure 6, has a pattern which reproduces substantially a cylindrical surface, while in the proximities of the edges or in alignment with the points indicated at 21 in Figure 6, the curvature is enhanced with subsequent flat run of the segment, thereby the edge indicated at 22 in Figure 6 is caused to mate with the edge 23 of the adjoining segment. That configuration is particularly convenient because it provides great stability of the configuration to be obtained after positioning the spring 17 which forms the assembling element for the shield. To provide additional stability for the structure, as shown in Figure 7, it may be expedient to insert through the front opening of the device a bushing 24 comprising a cylindrical body 25 which is inserted into the shield and is completed by a front flange formation 26 which is left outside the shield. Said bushing 24 has an axial bore 25 which allows the screw 18 through, it also forming a centering element therefor. The screw securing device illustrated in its simplest form comprises a three part metal shield formation, a metal expander cone, a single elastic element forming at one time an assembling element and an element of elastic bias opposing the expansion due to the cone, and a screw for pulling the cone and effecting the securement. The various component elements are, therefore, in reduced number and readily obtainable with simple machining operations. From the standpoint of operation, it should be noted that the spring 17, as suitably formed for example from a coiled strip, forms practically an elastic sleeve which permits the various segments making up the shield formation to be held together. The expander cone, owing to the presence of the annular channel 12 in which the hooks 8 of each segment are inserted, is hooked onto the shield formation ench that it cannot some apart or be loet even in the absence of the screw 17. The flattened areas 14 which are inclined because formed on the frusto conical surface 10, allow for a soft expansion of the segments and constitute the rotation preventing means which prevents the cone from turning relatively to the shield formation. In fact, the hook 8 which is flat, in mating through its inclined face 15 with the flattened area 14 generates a sufficient rotation preventing torque to prevent the screw 18 from dragging the cone therealong rotatively. The particular configuration of the cross section of the metal segments which make up the shield formation, which allows mating of the side by side edges, provides considerable stability for the shield which may be further improved by the insertion of the bushing 24. With the bushing 24 present, the metal segments 2,3 and 4 which make up the shield formation 1 could have the shape of exactly cylindrical portions, thus obtaining spread apart lines of side by side fitting of the various segments as shown in dotted lines in Figure 6 . Assembling would acritical, however, owing to the presence of the expander cone 9 and the bu24 ZiSpsille centering of the metal segments held together by the spring 17. The spring 17, which in the instance shown is viewed as formed from a strip, could be made in several parts while it would also be possible to use a wire instead of the strip. The removed portions 19 can prevent the rotation of the spring 17 relatively to the shield formation.In the worst case, in fact, if the spring 17 began to rotate, after a small angular rotation one of the ends of the spring would locate at a position corresponding to the removed area and enter it and abut against the edge of the following segment, thus eliminating any further possibility for rotation. Expediently, the outer faces of each segment will be machined with known techniques and designs to obtain secure anchoring in the hole whereinto the screw securing device is to be inserted. To prevent the screw securing device from turning bodily in the hole, there are provided rotation preventing wings obtained, in the instance shown, by folding over one of the edges of each segment wings 20 , but also obtainable in other ways such as the creation of raised wings proper on each segment. It may be appreciated from the foregoing that all of the objects which had been proposed have been achieved, and in particular that the screw securing device so constructed is easily obtained with simple machining operations. Specially convenient is to form the shield from a sheet metal strip, while the use of a single assembling spring imparts the device expansion with particularly soft features. Of course, based upon this same inventive concept, various and different may be the embodiments of the product, just as the materials and dimensions may be any ones contingent on requirements.
