# A polyethylene ether resin composition.

## Abstract
A polyphenylene ether resin composition comprising a polyphenylene ether resin and a rubber modified resin, said rubber modified resin containing a discontinuous elastomer ic rubber phase dispersed in a continuous resin phase comprising a copolymer of a vinyl cyanide compound and a vinyl aromatic compound or a mixture of a homopolymer of a vinyl aromatic compound and a copolymer of a vinyl cyanide compound and a vinyl aromatic compound, said elastomeric rubber phase comprising a grafted elastomeric rubber which has a graft phase of a copolymer of vinyl cyanide compound and a vinyl aromatic compound and having a grafting degree of 20 to 300 by weight, the contents of vinyl cyanide compound moiety in the graft phase and resin phase being 5 to 30 by weight and 3 to 10 by weight, respectively. The polyphenylene ether resin composition of the present invention is excellent in solvent resistance and colorability as well as impact strength.
