## Description
A Buckle Structure for Straps, Belts and the LikeThe present invention relates to a buckle structure for leather wrist straps, belts and the like.As is known, there are currently available on the market various types of buckle for straps and belts, which are made with the most widely disparate constructional criteria, which generally do not always give the possibility of effecting a precise locking of the strap or belt without leaving the region of coupling of the belt with the associated hooking element in view.Another disadvantage attributable to the solutions of the known art is further constituted by the fact that, in many cases the actuation of the belt is relatively difficult, having to be effected by means of movements which, in many cases, are not natural and easily performed by the user.The purpose which the present invention proposes is that of eliminating the previously lamented disadvantages, by providing a new buckle for leather straps and belts and the like, which will give the possibility of effecting the stable and secure locking onto the strap or belt without by this having to effect complex or difficult movements.Within the scope of the above explained object, a particular object of the invention is that of providing a buckle structure for watch straps, belts and the like which will give the possibility of covering the zone of use between hooking pin and belt covered from view, thus contributing, as well as having an increased functional characteristic, toa significant aesthetic improvement.Another object of the present invention is that of providing a structure for buckles of straps, belts and the like, which by its particular constructional characteristics is able to offer the widest guarantees of reliability and security in use.Not the least object of the present invention is that of providing a buckle structure which will easily be obtainable starting from elements and materials which are commonly commerically available and which moreover, will be competitive from an economic point of view.The above explained object, as well as the objects listed and others which will become better apparent herinbelow, are achieved by a buckle structure for wrist straps, belts and the like, according to the invention, characterised by the fact that it comprises a connection body connectable to the end of a wrist strap and the like, and defining a channel for the passage of the wrist strap, to the said connection body there being pivoted a hooking body provided with at least one pin engagable in one of the holes defined in the other end, there further being provided means for the removable locking of the hooking body with respect to the connection body.Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become more clearly apparent from a study of the detailed description of a buckle structure for wrist straps, belts and the like illustrated by way of indicative, but none limitative, example, with the aid of the attached drawings, in which Figure 1 schematically represents the buckle according to the invention in an open position and fitted to a strap Figure 2 shows, in section the buckle in a closure position fitted to a strap Figure 3 illustrates the buckle, seen from its rear end Figure 4 represents the buckle, seen in plans Figure 5 shows the buckle seen from its front end Figure 6 represents a section, along the line VI VI at Figure 4.With particular reference to the numerical symbols of the said figures, the buckle structure for wrist straps, belts and the like which is indicated generally with the reference numeral 1 , comprises a connection body 2 which can be fitted to the end 3a of a wrist strap, belt or the like, generally indicated with the reference numeral 3 .The body 2 defines, internally, a through channel t4 into which the other end 3b of the belt 3 can be introduced.The through channel 4 , in correspondence with its front part, has a lower entrance section 5 and upper entrance section 6 which facilitate the introduction into it of the end 3b of the strap 3 .The end 3a of the strap is connected to the body 2 by means of a loop 30 defined about a pin 7 which is housed in a cavity 8 defined in the body 2 .The peculiarity of the invention is constituted by the fact that to the body 2 there is pivoted a hooking body, generally indicated with the reference numeral 10 , which has a substantially bridge like conformation and is hinged in correspondence with the pin 7 .The hook body 10 has lateral arms 11,12 which lie laterally along the side of the body 2 and which are joined together by a front bridge 13 which is positionable in correspondence with the front part of the channel 4 .From the front bridge 13a extends a hooking pin 14 which can be introduced into one of the holes 15 defined on the end 3b of the belt 3 .The buckle includes locking means which act between the hook body 10 and the connection body 2 in such a way as to removably lock the hook body 10 in the closure position on the connection body 2 .Such locking means are constituted by a small bolt 20 sliding within a seat 21 defined by the body 2 , and resiliently thrust by resilient means constituted by a spring 22 which serve the function of resiliently urging the small bolt 20 outwardly which, inwardly has an insertion point 22 connectable in a hooking seat 23 defined on the inner face on one of the lateral arms, for example, the arm 11 . Rigidly connected to the bolt 20 is an actuating head 25 which emerges on the surface outside the face in view of the connection body 2 , and is actuable in such a way as to make the small bolt 20 slide against the action of the spring 22 , thus making it re enter the seat 21 in order to be able to effect opening of the bridge 13 as illustrated in Figure 1.With the hook body 10 in the open position the user can introduce the end 3b of the belt 3 into the channel 4 positioning it at the desired point. The locking is effected simply by closing the hook body 10 to the connection body 2 thus obtaining the locking of the body 10 on the body 2 by engagement of the small bolt 20 in the coupling seat 23 .In these conditions the end 3b of the strap or belt 3 is firmly retained without the connection being visible from the outside.Moreover, the particular configuration adopted makes it possible to obtain buckles with a new conformation, moreover having a great functionality both as far as the locking safety of the belt is concerned and as far as its practicality of utilisation is concerned. From what has been described hereinabove it will be seen how the invention achieves the proposed objects.In particular, the fact is emphasized that a buckle of new type is obtained, in which the hook element, constituted by a hook pin 14 , is provided on a hook body which is pivoted with respect to the connection body 2 which is removably lockable with respect to the body itself in such a way to obtain the precise locking.Moreover, the connection body 2 defines, internally, a channel in which the end 3b of the strap 3 is introduced, thus having a secure guide for the free end of the strap or belt.In practice, the materials used, as long as they are compatible with the specific use, as well as the dimensions and contingent forms, can be anything appropriate according to requirements.
