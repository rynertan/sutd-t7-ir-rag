# Rotor shaft.

## Abstract
A rotor shaft suitable for use as the rotor shaft of a steam turbine has a rotor shaft portion 2 made of a Cr alloy steel having martensite structure and containing 8 to 13 Cr and at least one journal portion at which the shaft is rotatably sup ported by a bearing. To improve the bearing properties of such a shaft, when made of 8 to 13 Cr steel, a steel 4 is fitted around the journal portion. The sleeve 4 is divided in the cir cumferential direction into a plurality of segments which are assembled together by welding or fitting to form the sleeve which has a circular cross section. The sleeve is of a low alloy steel, e.g. a bainite steel.
