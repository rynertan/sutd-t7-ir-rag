# Method for making metal contact studs between first level metal and regions of a semiconductor device compatible with polyimide filled deep trench isolation schemes.

## Abstract
The present method discloses the steps to form metal device contact studs 28 between regions of a semiconduc tor device, such as an NPN vertical bipolar transistor 10 , and the first level metal, the studs overlapping both a contact region, such as the base 15 or the collector 26 , and an adjacent polyimide filled trench 23 . The method comprises the following steps a applying a lift off mask exposing said contact region and adjacent trench without attacking the polyimide fill, b blanket depositing the stud forming metal onto the whole structure, c lifting off said mask and the overlying metal, d blanket depositing a second dielectric layer onto the whole structure, the thickness of said second layer being approx imately the stud height, e removing said second dielectric layer until the top surface of the highest contact stud is exposed and f polishing both the metal and said second dielectric layer to leave a substantially planarized structure ready for further personalization.
