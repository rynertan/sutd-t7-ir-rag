# Improved process for making thiobiscarbamates.

## Abstract
An improved method for the preparation of stable, thiobis carbamates in high yields and high purity is provided which involves the in situ reaction of a carbamate with a sulfur chloride in the presence of a nitrogen containing heterocyclic base and thereafter quenching and washing the reaction slurry with an alcohol at low temperatures.
