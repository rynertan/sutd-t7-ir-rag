# Insulated pipeline.

## Abstract
An insulated pipeline having spaced sections of heat insu lating material held between a continuous corrosion resistant coating 2 on the pipe and an outer protective jacket 5 , there by to provide a flexible composite which renders the pipeline resistant to mechanical and chemical attack while provided heat insulation for the pipeline in a manner which allows the pipeline to flex, for example during laying. The pipeline is pref erably in the form of a continuous protective matrix bonded to the pipe and enveloping individual sections of the heat insulat ing material.
