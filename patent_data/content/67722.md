# A method of producing a photoelectric conversion layer and a method of producing an image pickup device.

## Abstract
A hydrogen containing amorphous silicon layer formed in a plasma atmosphere is formed while the substrate temperature is held below 200 C whereafter the plasma is stopped and the layer is heated in the temperature range 200 400 C without intermediate cooling of the substrate. The product has improved characteristics and the defect rate is low. The saturation field for photocurrent of electrons or holes can be made low. When using electrons as major carriers, preferably the heat treatment is in the temperature range 200 240 C, and when using holes as major carriers, it is preferably in the range 270 400 C.
