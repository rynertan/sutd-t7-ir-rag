# Data processing tape drive system.

## Abstract
Tape drive system including means for threading car tridge magnetic tape over a predetermined data processing path 3 to a takeup reel 14. A cam track 17 is provided in a cover over the path. The track has a beginning point for positioning a longitudinal cam member 20 into engagement with a leader block 2b exposed through an opening in the cartridge. The track terminates over the takeup reel rotational axis. A bifur cated linkage member 19 is connected at one end to said longitudinal cam member, and to a drive motor 24. Rotation of the linkage member positions the longitudinal cam member between ends of the track engaging the leader block and threading it through the path and into a slot 14c on the takeup reel.
