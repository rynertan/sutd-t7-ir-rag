# Improvements in and relating to clotheslines.

## Abstract
A collapsible clothesline 10 intended to be stored in situ in the ground and to be erected by water pressure. The clothesline comprises a casing 11 intended to be located in a bore in the ground and a stem 14 which is retractible into and extensible from the casing. The stem itself consists of an inner and an outer stem element 15, 16 with the former being retractible downwardly into and extensible upwardly from the latter. A number of arms 22 linked by lines for supporting laundry, are pivoted to the outer stem element 15 and are connected by ties 28 to the upper end of the inner stem element 16 . When the inner stem element 16 is extended from the outer stem element 15 , with the outer stem element 15 already extended from the casing 11 , the ties 28 pull the arms 22 up from a storage position, in which they lie alongside the stem 14 , to a use position, in which they extend radially from the stem 14 . The clothesline is erected by supplying water pressure to the casing interior and collapsed by relieving such pressure.
