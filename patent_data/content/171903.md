# Improvements in or relating to infra red lenses.

## Abstract
An optically athermalised infra red lens has a group of at least three closely spaced lens elements of different respec tive materials having positive thermal coefficients of refrac tive index. Two of the elements are of materials whose refractive indices are relatively temperature insensitive, one 1 , e.g. of zinc selenide or chalcogenide glass, being positively powered and the other 2 , e.g. of zinc sulphide, being negatively powered to effect achromatisation and correct spherical aberration. The third element 3 is nega tively powered and of a relatively temperature sensitive refractive index material, e.g. germanium, of lower disper sion and higher refractive index than the other two. The lens may be the objective of an afocal telescope having an eyepiece 4,5,6 and associated scanner 7 and detector arrangement 8,9 and may effectively athermalise the whole system.
