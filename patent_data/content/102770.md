# EXHAUST GAS TREATMENT METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
Exhaust gas treatment method and apparatus extract heat from an exhaust gas by operating in a water condensing mode which allows more heat to be recovered, removes particulate matter and condensed acid from the exhaust gas, and washes heat exchange surfaces to keep them clean and wet to improve heat transfer. Systems for heating water, air, and both water and air are disclosed. Methods of constructing and assembling improved heat exchangers are disclosed.
