## Description
VEHICLE TRANSMISSION SYSTEMThis invention relates to a vehicle transmission system including a continuously variable ratio transmission unit of the toroidal race rolling traction type.Transmission systems of this type have been developed in various configurations for cars and commercial vehicles. One example is described in our published British Patent Application No.2108599. In these transmissions, neutral and reverse are produced by combining a direct output from the vehicle engine with an indirect output taken via the continuously variable ratio transmission and reversed in sense. In this socalled low regime , the ratio of the continuouslyvariable ratio transmission is varied to produce either a low range of reverse ratios, a low range of forward ratios, or geared neutral in which the engine is rotating, but the continuously variableratio transmission s output is rotating in the opposite sense and the combined output is zero .The forward range of ratios is produced by using the output of the continuous variable ratio transmission on its own so called high regime . As explained in this Specification, a problem arises in combining the direct and indirect outputs for the low regime, in that to produce a desired maximum forward ratio in this regime it may be necessary to combine the direct and 1indirect1 outputs in an awkward ratio, because the particular continuously variable ratio transmission used will have an optimum range of speeds of operation, depending on roller diameter, and so will the particular power unit. Given that the speed ranges of the direct and indirect output are fixed, a particular maximum forward ratio, and hence particular maximum combined output speed, can only be met for one particular ratio of combination.A vehicle transmission system in accordance with the invention comprises a casing, an input shaft for connection to an engine output shaft, a toroidal race rolling traction type continously variableratio transmission unit coaxial with and driven by the input shaft, a first simple epicyclic gear comprising a sun gear, planetary gears on a carrier and an annulus, one part of which gear is driven by the input shaft and another part can be locked relative to the transmission casing, a second simple epicyclic gear comprising a sun gear, planetary gears on a carrier, and an annulus, one part of which gear is driven by the transmission unit output shaft and another part is driven by the first simple epicyclic gear, wherein the sun gear and annulus of both simple epicyclic gears are coaxial with the input shaft, and a drive shaft for connection to a differential gear, the drive shaft driven by the annulus of the second simple epicyclic gear. This arrangement represents a simple solution to the problem of gear ratios in low regime.In the preferred embodiment, the first epicyclic gear has its sun gear connected to the input shaft its planetary gears carrier lockable relative to the casing, and its annulus connected to the planetary gears carrier of the. second epicyclic gear the sun gear of the second epicyclic gear is connected to the transmission unit output shaft.The system preferably is operable in a high regime by locking the second epicyclic gear annulus to the transmission unit output this is conveniently achieved by a clutch, which is open in low regime and engages in high regime. In some applications of the system, for example in rear engined buses, it is desirable to take drive from the system as close as possible to the engine, so that the drive shaft may be as long as possible.This is optimised in the preferred embodiment by arranging that the second epicyclic gear, from whose annulus the drive is taken, lies on the engine side of the first epicyclic gear, i.e.between the transmission unit and the first epicyclic gear.The angle between the drive shaft and the input shaft may be 90 degrees or any acute angle. In the preferred embodiment the drive shaft is coupled tp the second epicyclic gear annulus by bevelled gearing, allowing the drive shaft to be angled at about 45 degrees to the input shaft.In order that the invention may be better understood, the preferred embodiment will now be described with reference to the accompanying schematic drawing of a transmission system with a transmission unit and two coaxial simple epicyclic gears. Referring to the drawing, an input shaft 1 connected to an engine not shown defines the axis of the system. A continuously variable ratio transmission unit 12 of the toroidal race rolling traction type has its input connected to the input shaft 1. An output 2 of the transmission unit includes a shaft extending coaxially with the input shaft 1. A first simple epicyclic gear 13 for changing the input shaft speed comprises a sun gear 6 connected to the input shaft 1,. planetary gears 9 held by a carrier 7, and an outer annulus 8. A second epicyclic gear 14 has a sun gear 15 connected to the shaft extension of the transmission unit output 2, planetary gears 10 carried by the annulus 8 of the first epicyclic gear, and an annulus 4 which provides drive by bevel gearing to a drive shaft 3.The drive shaft 3 in this example is inclined at about 45 degrees to the system axis, and connects an axle differential gear to the transmission system at a point which is as close as practically possible to the transmission unit, at the engine end of the system. In a bus where the engine and transmission are above and to the rear of the rear axle, this enables the drive shaft to be longer than hitherto, and at a convenient angle to the horizontal. This preferred embodiment of the system is operable in two regimes, in the manner described above. In the low regime, where the drive is at low speeds in either the forward or reverse direction, or at neutral, the carrier 7 of the planetary gears 9 of the first epicyclic gear 13 is held stationary relative to the transmission casing 16 bE applying a band braKe 11. The use of a band brake 11 instead of a clutch is. considered preferable since it is easier to control internally by oil pressure. The brake is not required to slip, so there is no danger of excessive wear.It will be appreciated that the second epicyclic gear 14 sums the outputs from the transmission unit 12, and the input shaft 1 via the first simple epicyclic gear 13. The transmission unit 12 operates continuously, with the engine running, in the same direction of rotation, while the drive shaft 3, driven by the second simple epicyclic gear 14, rotates through a range of low forward and reverse speeds, according to the ratio set in the transmission unit. A microprocessor control unit not shown senses when the drive shaft speed approaches the maximum acceptable for low regime operation this may for example correspond to a conventional second gear drive speed. The system then changes into high regime, for the faster forward speeds only. At the change over speed, the rotational speed of the second epicyclic gear annulus 4 matches the speed of the transmission unit output 2. A clutch 5 then engages and locks the annulus 4 to the transmission unit output 2 throughout high regime operation. The band brake 11 is released, and the simple epicyclic gear 13 and 14 are no longer required for power transmission. The transmission system can be used in a driveline including a flywheel system for regenerative braking, as described for example in our EuropeanPatent Application No. 61276. Moreover, the invention is not limited in its application to heavy vehicles such as buses it is sufficiently simple and compact for a small saloon car.
