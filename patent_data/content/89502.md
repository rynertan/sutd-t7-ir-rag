## Description
The present invention relates to improved composites of the type containing a fiber network and apolymer matrix, and especially to such composite materials wherein both the fiber and polymer arepolyolefins. Composite materials containing fibers and polymer matrix are frequently employed to increase thephysical properties e.g. tensile strength and modulus of the polymer. Such materials may be in the formof sheets, films, molded objects of various shapes, stamped parts, shaped extrusions and pultrusions,foams and sandwich constructions. The fibers frequently employed are glass, graphite fibers, boron,aramids wholly aromatic polyamides and poly ester terephthalate . While such fibers have excellentmechanical properties and high melting points and softening temperatures, composites preparedtherefrom do not have a gain in properties that might be expected by the rule of mixtures. This reduction ingain may be attributable to weaknesses at the fiber polymer interface or other factors. Mead Porter, J. Appl. Polymer Sci., vol. 22, pp. 3249 3265 1978 report composites prepared fromsolid state extruded low molecular weight 58,000 or 18,400 number average molecular weight polyethylene fibers and polyethylene matrices both high and low density . In preparing the composites,bonding occurs at sufficient temperatures to bond the matrix to the fibers, which may also be sufficient toreduce the crystallinity or order of the fibers, at least at or near the fiber matrix interface. Figure 8 of thearticle presents the theoretical tensile strengths of the composites as a function of the volume fraction ofthe fiber. The actual results achieved were 0.025 GPa at 0.4 volume fraction fibers about 50 of theory and 0.062 GPa at 0.7 volume fraction fibers about 65 of theory . GB 1,360,115 discloses a composite structure comprising a plurality of polyolefine polyethylene orpolypropylene fibers in a matrix polymer of the same class of materials, i.e. a composite structureaccording to the preamble of claim 1. Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Volume13 3d ed. , J.Wiley Sons, Inc., 1981, pp 970 71, presentsinformation on fiber reinforced plastics and indicates thatnonwoven fabrics wherein fibers are straight, continuous andaligned parallel in a single direction provide the bestcharacteristics. Layers of the fabrics can be stacked withthe orientation of the individual layers aligned or misalignedfor high or non directional properties, respectively. The present invention provides a composite structure comprising a plurality of polyolefin fibers in apolymer matrix, characterised in that The composites of the present invention contain both a network of polyolefin fibers and a matrix of apolymer, which is preferably a polyolefin polymer. A variety of geometric forms of composites arecontemplated for the present invention, depending in part upon the nature of the fiber network, the natureand intermediate form of the polymer matrix and the assembly technique for the composite chosen fromamong those commonly available. The polyolefin fiber of which the fiber network is constructed may be any ultrahigh molecular weightpolyethylene or polypropylene of the above specified properties. This polymer fiber may be spun from asolution as in U.S. Patent 4,137,394 to Meihuzen et al., various publications by Pennings et al. such asColloid and Polymer Sci., vol. 257, pgs. 547 49 1979 or in application U.S. Application Serial No. 225,288of Kavesh et al. January 15, 1981 , copending and commonly assigned. The fiber may also be spun as a gelas in various works by Smith and Lemstra such as J. Mat. Sci., vol. 15, pp. 505 14 1980 , variouspublications of Kalb et al., such as J. Pol. Sci., vol. 18, pp. 87, or EP A 64,167. In the case of polyethylene fibers, the molecular weight is at least about 500,000 and is preferably atleast about 1,000,000. The tenacity of the fiber is at least 15 grams per denier 13.5 g dtex , and is preferablyat least about 25 grams per denier 22.5 g dtex , and more preferably, at least about 30 grams per denier 27g dtex . The modulus of the fibers, as measured by an Instron tensile testing machine, is preferably at leastabout 500 grams per denier 450 g dtex , more preferably at least about 750 grams per denier 675 g dtex ,even more preferably at least about 1000 g denier 900 g dtex , and most preferably at least about 1600 or2000 g denier 1440 or 1800 g dtex . The melting point of the polyethylene fiber measured at 10 C min is preferably between about 140 Cand about 151 C, especially when used in conjunction with polyethylene polymer for the matrix having asimilarly measured melting point between about 108 C and about 126 C. The achievement of fibers of these properties is described in the above documents, and especially inEP A 64,167. The fiber network contains such fibers in an arrangement withplanar layers of parallel fibers superimposed on top of other layers of parallel fibers, with the fibers of adjacent layers not being parallel, but rather generally perpendicular or at other angles. Exemplarystructures include layered arrangements with alternate layers generally perpendicular and arrangementswith each fifth layer being parallel and intermediate layers being shifted by 45 , 45 , 90 relative to thefirst layer, but in any order. It is also contemplated that the fiber network may take the form of a wovenstructure, continuous oriented fiber mat, chopped mat, or random oriented fibers. In a similar fashion, polypropylene fabric networks may be formed, with the above EP A 64,167disclosing in particular the preparation of polypropylene fibers of high molecular weight at least about750,000, preferably at least about 1,000,000 tenacity and modulus. In general, because of the lowercrystallinity of polypropylene compared to polyethylene, polypropylene fibers with tenacities of at leastabout 11 grams per denier, and preferably at least about 13 grams per denier and modulus at least about110 g denier, and preferably at least about 200 g denier are employed. While polypropylene fibers ofgenerally lower tenacity and modulus values are used, the melting points of the polypropylene fibers aregenerally higher, with a representative melting point being at least about 168 C, preferably at least about170 C. It will be appreciated that polypropylene fibers having these properties can be achieved only byprocedures which cause a high degree of orientation. The matrix polymer may be polyethylene, polypropylene or copolymers having polyethylene orpolypropylene crystallinity. The term polyethylene crystallinity is intended to mean substantial regionsin the polymer which appear similar on X ray diffraction analysis to crystalline polyethylene. The term polypropylene crystallinity is intended to mean regions in the polymer which have an X ray diffractionpattern similar to one or more of the crystalline forms of polypropylene isotactic and syndiotactic . It willbe appreciated that, for example, block copolymers of polyethylene and polypropylene will normally haveregions both of polyethylene crystallinity and polypropylene crystallinity. If the matrix polymer is polyethylene, then it may be any of the various known forms of polyethylene,including low density polyethylene density of between 0.90 and 0.94 g cm The matrix generally occupies much, and preferably substantially all, of the void spaces left by the fibernetwork. It is contemplated, however, that some of these void spaces may also be taken by fillers, otherreinforcements, and or gas. Various techniques are contemplated to place the matrix polymer around orwithin the fiber network. One such technique is to coat each fiber, or some of the fibers, with matrixpolymer, arrange the coated fibers into the desired network structure and then heat set the overall structureso as to cause the matrix polymer to flow and occupy the remaining void spaces. Another contemplatedtechnique is to arrange layers or other structures of fiber adjacent and between various forms, e.g. films, ofthe matrix polymer and then to heat set the overall structure. In such a case, as well as in the case of coatedfibers, it is possible that the matrix can be caused to stick or flow without completely melting. In general,however, if the matrix polymer is caused to melt, relatively little pressure is required to form thecomposite while if the matrix polymer is only heated to a sticking point, generally more pressure isrequired. In general, however, the pressure and time to set the composite and to achieve optimal propertieswill depend on the nature of the matrix chemical composition as well as molecular weight and processingtemperature. In various forms of the present composites, the fiber network occupies different proportions of the totalvolume of the composite. In general, it is preferred that the fiber network comprise between40 and about 90 volume percent, with the matrix occupying theremaining volume. It is more preferred, especially in the case of composites formed using films of thematrix polymer, that the fiber network occupy between about 40 and about 85 volume percent of thecomposite. One salient feature of the composites of the present invention is the retension of tenacity value for thecomposite, compared to the fiber network. in general, theory indicates that a composite containing fibers,in which the fiber and the network have drastically different tenacity values, would have a volume averagetenacity computed by multiplying the tenacity of the fiber times its volume proportion in the composite andadding that tenacity quantity to the tenacity of the matrix multiplied by its volume proportion. As indicatedby the above Mead and Porter article, such theoretical values are rarely achieved, and in the case ofpolyethylene polyethylene matrices, a value of 70 percent of theory was not achieved in the middle rangeof 40 70 volume percent fiber. In the composites of the present invention, it is a desired result that thestrength of the composite structure be at least 75 percent of the volume average tenacity of the polyolefinfiber network and of the polymer matrix. In the case of composites with the polyolefin fibers arrangedcompletely in a parallel fashion, it will be appreciated that the tenacity would ordinarily be measured in thedirection of the fibers. In case of laminates, the theoretical strength in a particular direction is calculated onthe base of fibre and matrix strengths, their moduli and Poisson s ratios, their volume fractions and numberof plies and their orientation by making use of derived stress strain relationships well known in the art ofcomposite materials. See, for example, J. E. Ashton and J. M. Whitney, Theory of Laminated Plates,Technomic Publ. Co., Conn., 1970 . Then the value of theoretical strength can be compared with the experimental result for a sample cutand tested in the direction. Since the polymer matrix has essentially no orientation, its tensile strength maybe measured on an ordinary shaped article such as a plaque or a sheet, whichever structure is most readilyavailable. Several examples of this type of computation are given in the examples. The fibers used in the Comparative Examples 1 3 were prepared by the techniques of Kavesh et al., EP A 64,167,starting with a 7 solution of an 17.5 dL g intrinsic viscosity measured in decalin at 135 C ultrahighmolecular weight polyethylene in paraffin oil. The fibers were stretched at the temperatures and stretch ratios indicated in Table I, giving fibers withthe tenacities in g denier , tensile modulus values in g denier , elongation values in percent andwork to break values in GJ m A 48 filament strand of extended chain polyethylene fibers, designated G in Table I, above, of 4.27 mlength was divided into 21 pieces of 8 inches 20.32 cm length each. The first 16 pieces were placedbetween two sheets of low density polyethylene film 20.32 cm 0.5 cm 0.07 mm and molded under mild 2700 kPa pressure at various temperatures five at 102 112 C, five at 115 123 C and six at 140 C forabout ten minutes. The resulting sixteen composites and the five remaining fiber pieces were then tested inan Instron Tensile Testing Machine using a 5 inch 11.25 cm gauge length at a 5 inch min 11.25 cm min pulling rate at room temperature. The average for 5 6 samples in each case force at specimen failure in pounds and Newtons isindicated in Table II. The contribution of the polyethylene coating or matrix was calculated as no more than one pound 4.45N . By adding this contribution to the force of failure of untreated strand, we get theoretically estimatedvalues for the force of failure of the composite. A ratio for the composite strength obtained to thestrength theoretically estimated is also given in Table II. The ratio exceeds 1.0 in all three instances. Theincrease in composite coated fiber strength must be attributable to some favorable interaction, whichovershadowed the loss of fiber crystallinity, if any, that occurred during molding. A 48 filament strand of extended chain polyethylene fibers, designated G in Table 1 above, of 168 in 4.27 m length was divided into 21 pieces of 8 in 20.23 cm length each. These pieces were tested on theInstron Tensile Testing Machine with a 5 inch 11.25 cm gauge length and 5 inch min 11.25 cm min loading rate. First 9 pieces were tested by pulling 3 strands simultaneously. These 3 strand tows failed at averageforce of 82 lbs 364.9 N ultimate stress 1.57 GPa . Four samples of composite consisting of 3 parallel strands molded between two layers of HDPE film 8in 20.3 cm 0.7 cm 0.007 cm each were prepared. The samples failed at an average force of 89 lbs 334 N ultimate stress 1.66 GPa . When the contribution of the matrix 3 lbs 13.35 N obtained from testing of neat matrix is added tothe failure force of 3 strand fiber samples, the ratio of the composite strength to the theoretically expectedis 1.05. This example illustrates that the higher melting higher density polyethylene matrix coating also had afavorable interaction with the extended chain polyethylene fibers. A series of coated fibers, labelled H in Table I, were prepared as in Examples 1 and 2 and twocomparative materials were prepared one substituting Kevlar 29 aramid fibers simulating defects instructure for the extended chain polyethylene fibers, the other molding test pieces of similar size out ofhigh density polyethylene only. The three sets were then tested in the Instron Tensile Tester in thetransverse direction for the two composites . The polyethylene B polyethylene composite failed at anaverage of 23 pounds 102.3 N , the aramid polyethylene composite failed at 14.2 pounds 63.2 N and thesame polyethylene failed at 22 pounds 97.9 N . The conclusion is that, upon molding, the composites of extended chain polyethylene fibers with highdensity polyethylene matrix obtain the transverse strength of the matrix, even though the extended chainpolyethylene fibers, themselves, had essentially no transverse strength. A high molecular weight linear polyethylene intrinsic viscosity of 18 in decalin at 135 C was dissolvedin paraffin oil at 220 C to produce a 6 wt solution. This solution was extruded through a sixteen hole die hole diameter 1 mm at the rate of 3.2 m minute. The oil was extracted from the fiber withtrichlorotrifluoroethane trademark Genetron 113 and then the fiber was subsequently dried. One ormore of the multifilament yarns were stretched simultaneously to the desired stretch ratio in a 100 cm tubeat 145 C. Details of sample stretching are given in Table III, along with selected fiber properties. High density polyethylene film Paxon 4100 high density polyethylene, an ethylene hexene 1copolymer having a high load melt index of 10 made and sold by Allied Corporation was placed on bothsides of a three inch by three inch 6.75 cm 6.75 cm steel plate and then layers of parallel multistrand yamof high tenacity polyethylene yarn as described below were wound around the plate and film until the filmon both sides was covered with parallel fibers. Film was then again placed on both sides and the yarn waswound in a direction perpendicular to the first layer. The process was repeated with alternating film andfiber layers, and with adjacent fiber layers being perpendicualr to each other until the supply of fibers wasexhausted or a fiber content of 7 g for each side has achieved. The wound plate was then molded underpressure for 30 minutes at 130 140 C. The sample was then removed and slit around the edges to producean A and B sample of identical fiber type and a real density. The above procedure was followed six times with the fibers indicated in Table IV. For Example 4, 37.4weight of the fibers used were as indicated by the line 4 1 and 62.6 weight of the fibers were asindicated by the line 4 2. Bullet fragments of 22 caliber projectile Type 2 meeting the specifications of Military SpecificationMIL P 46593A ORD were shot at each of the composites at an approximate velocity of 347 m sec using thegeometry of Plotting the energy loss versus fiber tenacity shows a positive correlation, with the relationship beingfairly linear, excpet for low values for both composites of Example 8 which may have experienced fibermelting during molding . The procedure of Examples 4 9 was repeated using a 26.5 g denier fiber, except that only a single pairof composites was prepared. Then the two composites were molded together using a film of low densitypolyethylene between them. This composite had 68 fibers and a fiber areal density of 1.31 kg m Composites were prepared as in Examples 4 9 using a melt spun polyethylene fiber having a tenacityof 5.6 g denier. Some fiber melting occurred during molding due to the close melting points of the meltspun fiber and the high density polyethylene fiber. On firing a projectile the velocities measured before andafter imapet were 342.3 and 320.3 m sec 1123 ft sec and 1051 ft sec , for energies before and after of 64.51J and 56.5 J. The energy loss, based on a fibral areal density of 1.31 kg m A high tenacity polyethylene fiber tenacity 18.4 g denier, tensile modulus 673 g denier was coatedwith low density polyethylene from a toluene solution. The polyethylene tradename Union CarbidePE DPA 6169 NT had a melt index of 6 and a density of 0.931 g cm Example 12 was repeated using a high tenacity polyethylene fiber tenacity 19.0 g denier, modulus 732g denier coated with high density polyethylene tradename EA 55 100, melt index 10, density 0.955g cm For comparison, a 1500 denier Kevlar 29 aramid yarn 22 g denier woven roving fabric prepreggedwith phenolic polyvinyl butyral resin resin content 20 weight was molded for 20 minutes at 166 C.Three such plaques 14A, 14B and 14C were prepared with a fiber areal density of 1.04 kg m The six composites of Examples 12 and 13 and of Comparative Example 14 were taped over a 2.2 inchby 2.1 inch 5.6 cm 5.6 cm cut in a three eighths inch 1 cm plywood sheet. Bullet fragments .22 type 2 according to Military Specification MIL P 46593A ORD were fired through the plaques using the geometryof These results indicate comparable performance for composites prepared from polyethylene fibers of18.4 19.0 g denier tenacity and composites prepared from aramid fibers of 22 g denier. Since the processof Kavesh et al. can produce fibers of tenacity 30 g denier, 40 g denier or higher, it is expected that thesefibers would substantially outperform aramid fibers for ballistic applications. Four 16 filament polyethylene xerogels was prepared according to the procedure described abovebefore Example 1, but with 16 spinnerettes. One of the yarns having been prepared from a 22.6 IV polymer was stretched using one end at 140 C 18 1 the other three yarns were stretched together 48 filaments at140 C 17 1 . The properties of these two yarns were measured and are displayed in Table VII withpublished data on Kevlar 29 aramid yarn. An aluminum plate three inchesxthree inchesxfour tenths inch 7.6 cm 7.6 cm 1 cm was woundwith one yarn, then covered with a 1.4 mil 0.036 mm thick high density polyethylene film AlliedCorporation s 060 003 , then wound in a perpendicular direction with yarn, then coated with film. After 10fiber layers and 10 film layers were present on each side of the plate, the covered plate was cured at 136.6 Cfor 15 minutes at 400 psi 2.76 MPa pressure. After molding, the composite ensemble was split around its edges to remove the aluminum plate. Oneof the 10 layer composites was retained for ballistic testing and the other was used as a central core forwinding an additional 6 yarn film layers to prepare a composite containing a total of 22 yarn layers both 16fil yarn and 48 fil yam were used . The areal densities and the fiber areal densities of the 10 layer and 22layer ECPE composites are given in Table VIII, below. The fiber volume fraction was about 75 in each. Ballistics testing of these composites are described below. A fourteen layer composite similar to the twenty two layer composite of Example 16 was prepared bywinding two fiber film layers onto each side of a similar ten layer composite. The fourteen layer compositehad a total areal density of 0.274 kg m Composites of Kevlar 29 aramid and polyester resin were prepared in a similar manner except that thematrix polyester system was doctored onto each Kevlar layer to impregnate the ensemble. The polyestersystem was Vestopal W plus 1 tertiary butyl perbenzoate and 0.5 cobalt naphthenate. The ensembleswere cured at 100 5 C, for one hour at approximately 400 PSI 2.76 MPa pressure. The areal densities andfiber areal densities are given in Table VIII. The fiber volume fractions were 75 . Ballistic testing of the composites of Examples 15 17 and the Kevlar 29 polyester 3 3 compositeplaques of Comparative Example 18 were performed in an identical manner. The plaques were placedagainst a backing material consisting of a polyethylene covered water filled urethane foam block. Thedensity of the backing material was 0.93 g cm The qualitative results are displayed in Table VIII. In the column labelled Penetration the word Yes means that the bullet passed complately through the plaque the word No means that the bullet wasstopped within the plaque. These results indicate that the composites using polyethylene fibers may of 18 21 g denier tenacitymay required roughly the same areal density 0.167 0.05 g cm The bullet exit side of Example 10 was examined by scanning electron microscopy and found to have afibrillar structure similar to that reported for Kevlar fibers Ballistic Materials and PenetrationMechanics R. C. Laible Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company 1980 . Fibers exhibited extensivelongitudinal splitting similar to that found when fibers were broken in an Instron Tensile Tester using a 10inch 25.4 cm length of fiber pulled at 10 in min 25.4 cm min . There was no evidence of the smooth knobsshown at the end of impacted polyester fibers shown in Figure 6, Page 84 Ballistic Materials andPenetration Mechanics. The knob like structure at the end of the impacted polyester is attributed tomelting . Example 5B see Table V exhibited similar morphology after ballistic impact, but fibrillation wasless extensive, and there was evidence of a minor amount of melting.
