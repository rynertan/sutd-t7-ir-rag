# Method of controlling operation of an electrostatic precipitator.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of controlling the DC voltage in an electrostatic precipitator which is energized by pulses superimposed on the DC voltage. In order to control the DC voltage the pulses are turned off periodically and the corona discharge current, resulting from the DC voltage, is measured and compared with a set value. If the discharge current measured is lower than the set value then the DC voltage is increased and if the discharge current is higher than the set value then the DC voltage is decreased. The DC voltage may be temporarily increased during the time when the corona discharge current is measured or, alteratively the DC voltage can be arranged to be con tuously increased or decreased and the measuring of the corona discharge current can be arranged either to maintain the increase or decrease or to change an increase to a decrease and vice versa.
