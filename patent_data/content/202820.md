# AN ULTRA VIOLET RAY WATER PURIFIER

## Abstract
An ultra violet ray water purifier has a tubular UV lamp and an annular duct having an inner cylindrical wall defined by a quartz tube containing said UV lamp and an outer wall bearing one or more internally facing ridges which restrict the flow of water in the axial direction of the duct and cause turbulence therein such that all the water is brought into close proximity with the quartz tube for equal treatment by the UV rays during its passage through the purifier. The ridge may comprise circumferential rings or one or several helixes spaced along the duct in the axial direction and where more than one helix is present, these may wind in alternate directions. Preferably the ridges are provided by indenta tions in the outer wall of the duct. Controlled heating means is included for heating the UV lamp.
