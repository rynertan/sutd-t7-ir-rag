# Method of inhibiting explosions in a pulverizing system.

## Abstract
A method is provided for inhibiting the occurrence of explosions or puffs in a coal pulverizing mill during dangerous periods at start up and shut down. A primary air stream which dries the coal and also transports the pulverized coal has its available oxygen content reduced to less than about 18 by the injection into the stream of water vapour at a temperature preferably above 120 C. The amount of water vapour is however less than that which could cause agglomeration of the coal. The period of injection may be between 5 and 30 seconds at start up and 2 to 30 minutes during shutdown, while the system is being cleared of remanent pulverized coal.
