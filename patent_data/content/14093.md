# An apparatus, a method and a disposable blood pathway for use in separating blood into components thereof.

## Abstract
The apparatus centrifugally separates blood into plasma rich and plasma poor components the latter being returned to donor. A self balancing centrifuge is used immediately adja cent the donor. The blood pathway is completely disposable and includes a phlebotomy needle 16 and blood compatible tubing connecting to a flexible blood processing bag 50 sup ported within a contoured processing chamber between shoes 74,78 in the centrifuge rotor 94 so that second blood component travels along a short internal bag dimension to achieve separation. Blood from the donor is pumped by pump 36 under control of weight and pressure detectors 32 and 34 to the bag 50 via tubing 41 and 49 and tubing 49 is cut and sealed. A displacement chamber 69 provides a fluid ope rated diaphragm to express separated first blood component from the bag 50 through tubing 60 into receiver container 61 as the centrifuge rotor spins. Expressing fluid is supplied via tubing 92 from station 93 . Piston and cylinder 95 ope rates fluid clamp 142 . The centrifuge can then be stopped to allow return of second blood component to donor via spike 46 plugged into an outlet port in the bag 50 when displace ment chamber 69 is further operated. Further spike 46 al lows the corresponding return of a further plasma poor frac tion to the donor, by pump 38 through spike 46 after a fur ther contribution fed into the bag 50 .
