## Description
PROTEIN ENZYME DERIVATIRrE This invention relates to a protein enzyme derivative, i.e. a purified enzyme subunit, which may be labelled, to antibodies recognising it, to methods of assaying it, and to diagnostic kits comprising the labelled subunit and a respective antibody. Creatine kinase, hereinafter referred to as CK, is a protein enzyme found in muscle and other tissues. There are at least three presently accepted isoenzyme forms of CK. Each isoenzyme molecule is comprised of two subunits these two subunits are called M and B, respectively. Thus, there can be a CK isoenzyme with two M subunits hereinafter called MM , an isoenzyme with two B units hereinafter called BB , and an isoenzyme with one B and one M subunit hereinafter called MB . The MM isoenzyme is characteristic of skeletal muscle, the BB isoenzyme is predominantly localized to brain but is also found in various smooth muscle including the gut and the uterus. The MB isoenzyme is thought to be specific for the human heart muscle myo cardium . Blood tests for total CK enzyme activity have been used in diag nosis and estimation of severity of myocardial infarcts since 1962, Hughes, Coin. Chem. Acta., 7 597 1962. It has been known since the early 1970 s that the MB isoenzyme is released into the circulation following a myocardial infarct. See, e.g., Klein, et.al., Cardiovascular Research 7, 412 418 1973 or Roe, et.al., J . Lab. Coin. Med., 80 577 1972. However, since it is presently accepted that most of theCK in the plasma or serum of normal man is MM approximately 98 , a specific change in the MB fraction could not be accurately measured because of the coincident measurement of the MM background. Subsequent electrophoretic separation of total serum CK into its isoenzymes has been used as a diagnostic test for myocardial infarcts.However, the procedure is non quantitative and only provides an estimate of the relative percentage of the isoenzyme. Moreover, electrophoretic systems are relatively insensitive at the lower range of MB activity thereby resulting in frequent false negative tests. Also, at high MB activities the relative percentage of MB is frequently over estimated leading to numerous false positive tests. More recently, several other methods have been developed in search of better specificity and sensitivity for MB activity as well as ease of operation. One such class of methods involves separation on ion exchange resins formed in a column or attached to glass beads.Although this method theoretically achieves greater analytic sensitivity, in practice this sensitivity has not been achieved because the isoenzymes are incompletely removed from the resin. Moreover, increased specificity has not been achieved because the MM fraction frequently tails into the MB fraction, especially at high MM concentrations. Since in patients with disease MM represents about 85 to 99 of total activity, even a 1 2 carryover of MM activity in the MB zone can give false positive tests. Accordingly, the current CK isoenzyme fractionation techniques have not been found to be completely acceptable. Immunoassay procedures have also been under study and reported upon in the literature. An immunoassay procedure used in measuring MB activity values has recently been marketed. This procedure utilizes an antibody allegedly specific for MM, thereby removing MM activity from the serum sample. The CK activity measurable is therefore attributed to MB since the BB isoenzyme had been thought to be restricted to brain tissue, thereby not interfering with the measurement of MB, Merck, GMBH, U.S. Patent 4,067,775. Other procedures involving immunological techniques have focused upon the theoretical cross reactivity of an antibody made to BB with the B subunit of MB,Roberts, et.al., Science, 194 855 1976.The rationale accompanying this approach is two pronged 1 A rise in BB concentration will not be observed in serum of a patient having a suspected myocardial infarct, 2 the BB antibody will have sufficient cross reactivity to bind the B subunit of MB, thereby providing a means for evaluating MB release into blood following a myocardial infarct. Currently, this approach is being used in research areas utilizing radioimmunoassay as a potentially promising tumor marker since prostatic carcinoma and adenocarcinoma give off substantial quantities of BB which are recognized by an antibody to B CK, Clinical Chemistry News, 5, p. 1,Sept. 1979. Additionally, a B CK radioimmunoassay kit is on the marketplace for myocardial infarcts and prostatic carcinoma detection.However, these assays have significant drawbacks, including, inter alia, the lack of sufficiently pure standards, relatively unstable radiolabeled ligand, and lengthy incubation periods. Additionally, and perhaps of even greater significance, these assays only measure enzymatically active B subunit. The presence of an immunoassay, particularly a radioimmunoassay, which solves these problems would be a significant step forward in this area.BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention, an antibody recognizing B subunit of CK and having a high affinity constant has been raised. A highly purified B subunit of CK, essentially, if not totally, free of albumin and essentially enzymatically inactive has been prepared.This B subunit of CK which is referred to hereinafter as CK Bi when radiolabeled is of markedly increased stability. A process of radiolabeling CK Bi is novel. Another aspect of the invention is the preparation of the purified CK Bi. An immunoassay utilizing the above identified CK Bi antibody, labeled CK Bi and purified CK Bi as a standard has evolved. The immunoassay is readily marketed as a mercantile unit, preferably a kit, as well as a laboratory service. Set forth below in more detail are various aspects of this invention. An aspect of this invention is an immunogen designated CK Bi which is essentially free of albumin and essentially inactive enzy magically. Another aspect of this invention is an antibody which recognizesCK Bi, said antibody being prepared by 1 inoculating a host animal with an immunogen comprising heterologo CK Bi and 2 collecting the serum or plasma from said host animal. Such an antibody has been shown to have high affinity for its antigen as demonstrated by a very short incubation period during immunoassay. Another aspect of the invention is the steps necessary to prepare the essentially albumin free and essentially enzymatically inactiveB subunit of CK, i.e., CK Bi. A still further aspect of the invention is a method for radiolabeling CK Bi so as to produce a stable, labeled product. A still further aspect of the invention is a method for the assay of CK Bi in a sample which comprises incubating said sample with a known amount of labeled CK Bi and an antibody which recognizes CK Bi, separating the free CK Bi and free labeled CK Bi from the bound CK Bi and bound labeled CK Bi, measuri ngrthe amount of labeled CK Bi in either the free or antibody bound materials and determining the con centration of CK Bi in the sample by reference to a standard curve. A still further aspect is a kit wherein the component parts are assembled into an immunoassay for CK Bi concentration in a sample which comprises a a container having therein a first reagent and b a separate second container having therein a second reagent c said first reagent comprising an antibody which recognizesCK Bi and d said second reagent comprising labeled CK Bi, said first reagent being intended to be contacted with the sample containingCK Bi to be measured and with the second reagent in order to bind part of labeled CK Bi or unlabeled CK Bi to said antibody, the measurement value of the label being a function of the concentration of CK Bi in said sample.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The sample of CK Bi as being determined can be any biological fluid which contains detectable levels of CK Bi. Such fluids include blood, blood serum, blood plasma, tissue extracts and urine. The immunogen which can be used in raising the antibody is prepared in a manner substantially different from known art methods.Rather than seeking to preserve the enzymatic activity as done in theRoberts and Nuclear Medical Systems assays, procedures are taken which purposefully render the CK BB isoenzyme, removed from source, enzymatically inactive or essentially inactive. The source of the CK Bi is any tissue or physiological fluid which has significant levels of the isoenzyme that is classically known as BB CK. Examples of such tissue and fluids are blood, amniotic fluid, seminal fluid, uterine tissues, prostatic tissues, cerebrospinal fluid, lung tissue, and breast tissue. A preferred source of CK BB is brain, more preferably human brain. The brain is initially prepared so as to minimize possible contaminants of the CK Bi, particularly blood components such as albumin. Standard processing steps of preparing BB Ck from brain are utilized with the additional following steps. Freshly removed brain should have the blood thoroughly washed away and then have the external pia arachnoid membranes stripped.These steps remove a significant amount of potentially contaminating albumin from the BB CK preparation. When brain tissue is utilized as the source of CK Bi, it is recommended that the cerebral arteries be perfused with phosphate buffered saline at 40 C for one hour in order to avoid contamination of the tissue with blood. At this point the brain may now be frozen prior to carrying out the modified Cart son procedure, Carl son, et.al., J. Molec. Cell. Cardiology 8, 159 1976 .Additional purification is performed by multiple reprecipitation with ethanol. This resultant preparation is essentially free of albumin as shown by electrophoresis and immunological reaction. Prior to the multiple reprecipitation with ethanol the BB CK shows CK activity.After the multiple reprecipitation, the CK activity is essentially absent and the resultant protein is CK Bi. This protein may be further purified using a linear salt gradient. As noted herein CK Bi may be isolated from various tissues including blood. We have found that CK Bi isolated from blood andCK Bi isolated from other tissues where there has been substantial contamination with blood components is glycosylated with an acid glycoside. When tissues other than blood are used as the source ofCK Bi, and one is careful to avoid blood contamination of the tissue, the CK Bi is not glycosylated. The non glycosylated and glycosylatedCK Bi have the same immunogenicity and either form of CK Bi may be utilized in raising antisera, for radiolabeling, and as a standard although it is preferred that the glycosylated form be used in standardization. The CK Bi obtained following the multiple ethanol reprecipitation step as generally described above has both a 38,000 dalton and a 42,000 dalton component as measured on sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 38,000 dalton component is preferable for radiolabeling, as well as for immunization and standardization. Additional characteristics of non glycosylated CK Bi are an isoelectric point of about 5.9 to 6.2 as measured by two dimensional isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gel and the tendency to aggregate in nondilute solutions. Glycosylated CK Bi has a molecular weight of about 67,000 to 80 ooo daltons as determined on Sephadex G 200 and about 42,000 on SDS polyacrylamide gel. Also glycosylatedCK Bi has an isoelectric point of 4.9 and is not precipitated by perchloric acid PCA . As used herein CK Bi is taken tomean both glycosylated CK Bi and non glycosylated CK Bi each of which is essentially free of albumen and essentially enzymatically inactive having less than one IU mg of enzyme activity. It should be noted that the labeling of this preparation as CK Bi is somewhat unique. Prior to this time, the identifying means of isoenzymes of creatine kinase has been enzymatic activity. This enzymatic activity is essentially absent in the preparation herein called CK Bi. However, the preparation was derived from purifiedBB CK, molecular weight determination of the CK Bi is consistent with the accepted value of the monomeric unit of BB CK, and the radioimmunoassay utilizing the labeled CK Bi appears to successfully follow those clinical conditions commonly associated with the rise in levels of CK Bi such as myocardial infarcts and prostatic carcinoma. The antibody to the immunogen CK Bi is prepared by injecting the immunogen into a host animal, preferably accompanied by an adjuvant, such as Freund s complete adjuvant, and an agent which enhances the inflammation response, such as mineral oil. Improved titres can be obtained by repeated injections over a period of time infrequently accompanied by an agent which nonspecifically enhances the immunologic response, such as pertussis vaccine. Suitable host animals for this purpose include mammals such as rabbits, horses, goats, guinea pigs, rats, cows, sheep and the like. The resulting antisera will contain antibodies which will recognize and bind CK Bi with a binding specificity of 70 to 90 .We have also found that immunization with essentially pure CK BB isoenzyme will result in antisera containing antibodies which will recognize and bind CK Bi, such antisera having a binding specificity for CK Bi of about 12 to 14 . The labeled CK Bi is used in competitive binding with CK Bi contained in the fluid or tissue sample in the immunoassay. The label is a substance which is detectable by a variety of physical methods using standard instrumentation. Labels such as radioisotope, chromophore, fluorophore, red blood cell, electron spin resonance group, enzyme, etc., can be employed. Radioisotopes such as tritium 3H , carbon 14 14C , or iodine isotopes such as 125iodine 12sI , iodine 131 131 1 can be used and are preferred. 1251 is the preferred radioisotope. The radioisotopically labeled CK Bi is prepared in a novel manner which elicits a stable radiolaeled material. The usual manner of attempting to radiolabel BB CK, and then always an enzymatically active BB CK, is through nonoxidative techniques such as the BoltonHunter ester method. These techniques have provided a nonstable radiolabeled material having a nonradiolabel related shelf life of from about three to about seven days. Although potentially useful in the laboratory where it is actually prepared, such an unstable material would not be an effective commercial agent. Stable radiolabeledCK Bi is prepared through oxidative techniques starting with CK Bi.The basic Hunter and Greenwood method, Nature 194, 495 1962 and various modifications, that is chloramine T N chloro 4 methylbenzenesulfonamide sodium salt oxidation can be used. The preferred oxidative method utilizes 1,3,4,6 tetrachloro 3a,6a diphenyl glycouril TCDG . Labeled material of high specific activity having a shelf life of eight weeks or longer is obtained in this manner. CK Bi for use as mass standard is prepared by taking the protein from either the ethanol reprecipitation step or the linear salt gradient and further purifying it on a 65 cm long Sephadex G 200 orSephacryl 300 column or by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . The protein standard which results is a single band on 6, 8 or 10 polyacrylamide gel, a single spot on two dimensional isoelectric focusing, a discrete peak on either Sephadex G 200 or HPLC.In addition, the standard is a single precipitant arc on immunoelectrophoresis against anti CK Bi antibody. Of course CK Bi further purified in this manner may be used as the immunogen to raise antibody in the manner described hereinabove and as well is suitable for labeling, e.g., radiolabeling as described herein. The immunoassay is preferably carried out as a radioimmunoassay.The radioimmunoassay is conducted as most immunoassays. The biological fluid or sample is incubated together with the radioisotopically labeled CK Bi, preferably 125I labeled, and antibody recognizing CK Bi in a buffer comprised of usual components useful in radioimmunoassay, for a significant period of time to achieve appropriate binding of antigen and antibody. After incubation, the labeled and unlabeledCK Bi is separated from the free labeled and unlabeled CK Bi by standard methods such as treatment with polyethylene glycol or contacting with a second antibody, the second antibody being an antibody specific for the gamma globulin of the host species in which the first antibody is raised. Such second antibody is prepared by standard techniques.Either the radioactivity from the bound or free material is measured and the concentration of CK Bi present in the biological fluid sample is determined through reference to a standard curve. The standard curve is derived by incubating fixed amounts of 125I CK Bi in the presence of a known concentration of antisera, with various known concentrations of CK Bi and plotting the counts observed against such concentration. As noted above non glycosylated CK Bi tends to aggregate under certain conditions and form dimers, trimers and tetramers of CK Bi.The immunoassay functions to measure the monomeric CK Bi. The present invention is further illustrated by the examples which follow.Example 1Preparation of B subunit of CK Human brain tissue 100 gm is obtained and stored frozen at 200 C until use. A modification of the method described by Carl son, et.al., is used to purify the CK BB isoenzyme. The brain tissue is washed of blood with an isotonic solution and the pia arachnoid membrane stripped. One hundred grams of tissue are processed at one time by homogenization in a precooled Waring blender containing 200 ml of ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.001 M 2 mercaptoethanol for three bursts of 15 seconds each. The resulting homogenate is centrifuged at 20,000 g in a Sorvall refrigerated centrifuge GSA 9304 for 20 minutes the supernate is retained.Cold ethanol 40 C is added dropwise to the supernate to a final concentration of 60 , followed by stirring for 30 minutes at 2,100 x g in the same centrifuge and the pellet discarded. Cold 95 ethanol is again added dropwise to a final concentration of 70 , and the solution stirred at 4 C for an additional 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 2,100 x g for 15 minutes. The pellet from these procedures is resuspended in ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.001 M 2 mercaptoethanol in a Dounce homogenizer 10.5 ml resuspension buffer per 100 ml supernate . This material is centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 30 minutes and the pellet discarded. Protein concentration and CK activity are determined on the supernate. DEAE Sephadex A 50 is swollen overnight in 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05 M NaCl and 0.001 M 2 mercaptoethanol. To the supernate from the previous ethanol precipitation, 4 M NaCl is added to yield a final concentration of 50 mM. This solution is then mixed with DEAE Sethedex A 50 in a proportion equal to 4.8 mg protein per milliliter ofgel. The combined solution is then mixed by gentle agi tation in a glass flask on ice for 30 minutes. The gel supernate suspension is placed in a 1 x 10 cm column anu allowed to settle. The void volume of buffer is discarded. The co jmn is eluted with ice cold 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.001 M 2 mercaptoethanol.One milliliter aliquots are scanned for protein at 280 nM, and the elution terminated when no further protein is detected in the eluates. The elution buffer was then changed to ice cold 0.05 MTris HCl containing 0.3 M NaCl and 0.001 M 2 mercaptoethanol. The eluates are similarly scanned for protein at 280 nM. The peak fractions of protein are then assayed for activity and the 5 ml of highestCK activity retained. This preparation has an average specific activity of 200 IU mg, and shows CK BB enzyme activity on cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Further purification is then performed by multiple, reprecipitation with ethanol. 95 ethanol is added to the pooled eluates from the above procedure to a final concentration of 70 . The mixture is then stirred for 30 minutes at 0 40 C and then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 20,000 x g. The resultant pellet is washed with 10 ml of 95 ethanol 4 C and recentrifuged at 32,000 x g for 15 minutes.This procedure is repeated a total of three times. The final pellet is assayed for CK activity and protein and then stored in a vacuum dessicator at 20 C. This preparation has a specific activity of less than one IU mg. This material again demonstrates mobility ofCK BB on cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The CK Bi thus obtained can be further purified, if desired, using a linear salt gradient, by procedures generally known in the art, tracking the pdsition of CK Bi in the gradient using a radioimmunoassay for CK Bi or merely collect the 150 nM NaCl eluate. The thus obtained CK Bi may be radiolabeled or may be used as the immunogen as described in the following examples with or without additional purification. The essentially inactive B subunit of CK prepared above, i.e.,CK Bi, is characterized by the following data. CK Bi is electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel in an Ames chamber by the method ofDavis, Ann, N.Y. Acad. Sci. 121, 404 1964 . The final purified protein demonstrates a single protein stained band on a polyacrylamide gel in the presence of 0.1Z sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS according to the method of Weber and Osborne, J. Biol. Chem. 244, 4406 1969 modified by substituting heating of the protein in SDS dialysis buffer for five minutes at 90 C rather than two hours at 370 C. This protein stained band is equivalent to a molecular weight of 38,000 to 42,000 daltons.Example 1APurification of CK Bi Protein from Human Serum Using Perchloric Acid PCA for Precipitant PCA precipitant Obtain human blood by venal puncture and ailow it to clot for 30 minutes at 370 C. Centrifuge at 1000 x g 4 C for 20 minutes. Harvest the serum in a Pasteur pipette. All subsequent steps should be performed on an ice cold bath or using a cooled centrifuge. Dilute serum five times with distilled water. Allow the mixture to stir for 15 minutes. Add to the diluted serum 60 PCA to a final concentration of 3 PCA while slowly stirring the serum. A white precipitate should immediately form. Continue stirring for an additional 30 minutes, pour the solution into a high speed centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 8000 x g for 20 minutes. Collect the supernatant. To the supernatant add two mM potassium hydroxide solution until the pH is adjusted to between 6 and 7. Stir the mixture for 20 minutes allowing a white precipitate to form. Stop stirring and tallow the precipitate to settle without centrifugation. Decant the solution leaving behind the precipitate. Pour the solution into a dialysis bag and dialyze against 100 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM tris buffer, pH 7.4.Change the buffer three times . The preferred dialysis bag is theSpectrapor membrane with a 12,000 to 14,000 molecular weight cut off. DEAE elution Make a 100 mililiter DEAE Sephadex column in 100 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM tris buffer, pH 7.4. A column with a 2.5 cm diameter gives a sufficiently fast flow rate. Add the buffer exchange solution to the column. Elute with a linear salt gradient from 100 mM sodium chloride to 400 mM sodium chloride in a volume of at least 200 ml. Collect 1 ml samples and assay for CK Bi using the CK Bi radioimmunoassay. The protein is then concentrated to the desired concentration. This procedure results in a 40 50 yield using the CK Bi standard as the mass standard. This protein is an acid glycoprotein as defined by its reaction with a Schiff PAS stain on two dimensional isoelectric focusing. In addition, this protein is not precipitated by 3 PCA, which is further evidence that it is a glycoprotein. Furthermore this protein has a significant affinity for concanavalin A.Example 2 Radioiodination Purified CK Bi is radioiodinated accord, to a modification of the method of Hunter and Greenwood. Twenty five 9 of CK Bi is dissolved in 25 ii of Tris 0.05 M, pH 8.0. Ten ul of this solution is then combined with 2 mCi Na125I New England Nuclear, IMS 60, pH 7.4 followed by 25 9 of chloramine T dissolved in 25 pl of phosphate buffer 0.4 M, pH 7.4. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 60 seconds at 4 C, interrupted by two brief vortex mixing steps.After 60 seconds, 50 ijg of sodium metabisulfite dissolved in 0.05 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, is added to the reaction vessel along with 10 pl of 0.01 M KI. Separation of organified and nonorganified iodine is performed on a Biogel P 6Q column 400 mesh 1 x 10 cm, eluted with 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0, containing O.O1 M EDTA at room temperature. One half milliliter fractions are collected in 10 glycerine. The radioiodinated protein is aliquoted into glass tubes containing a small amount of anion exchange resin Dowex I and stored at 20 C for further characterization and routine use. A preferred method of radioiodinating CK Bi is through the use of 19 5e,6 tetrachloro 3a,6a diphenyl glycouril. Conical borosilicate glass tubes are prepared containing 150 micrograms of the oxidant by its solubilization in chloroform, decanting into the tubes, and drying under nitrogen. The iodination was performed at room temperature for 15 minutes.The reagents used are protein 10 micrograms in 0.05 M Tris, pH 8.0 20 microliters , 2 milicuries of iodine pH 8 preferred , and 80 microliters of 0.4 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The reactants are stirred by finger flicking every five minutes. After 15 minutes the reactants are placed on a biogel column as stated above followed by a rinse of the reaction vessel with 200 microliters of column eluant. As determined by trichloroacetic acid 50 g IL precipitation, 70 of the 125I is incorporated into protein. In the presence of excess antiserum a maximum of 80 90 binding of 125I CK Bi can be demonstrated. Nonspecific binding of 125I CK Bi in the absence of antiserum averaged 1.5 . There was not a significant decrease in the percent binding of 125 CK Bi after eight weeks other than that expected from the basis of 125I decay. When freshly prepared l25I CK Biis studied by gel filtration on aSephacryl S 300 column, a single peak at 38,000 to 40,000 daltons is shown, indicating that the molecular weight of the radioiodinated material is that of the basic subunit. When using a somewhat more concentrated preparation of l25I CK Bi a single peak at about 67,000 to 80,000 daltons is observed on Sephadex G 200. Additionally, when the same material is studied on a polyacrylamide gel with 0.1 SDS, a single protein fraction equivalent to 38,000 to 40,000 daltons is demonstrated. When purified CK Bi is placed on the Sephacryl S 300 column, four distinct molecular weight components are observed corresponding to approximately 40, 80, 120 and 160 x 103 dalton indicating that purified BB CK from brain exists in vitro as multiple aggregates of a basic 40,000 dalton approximate subunit. The predominant immunoreactive form appears to be in the 40,000 molecular weight componnt.Example 3Immunizations Four adult new Zealand white rabbits are immunized. The primary immunization consists of 400 9 of CK Bi dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.05 MTris, pH 8.0. The protein is allowed to dissolve in the buffer fc 60 minutes at room temperature with constant stirring. This is combined with 0.5 of Freund s complete adjuvant and injected both intramuscularly and in multiple sites subcutaneously on the animal s back. Booster injections are performed consisting of 50 9 of protein in identical volumes of Tris buffer and adjuvant are performed at two month intervals. Incomplete Freund s adjuvant is used after an immunological response is detected. The animals are bled 10 to 14 days after each booster injection. All antisera are stored in aliquots at 20 C after adding 0.2 g of sodium azide per liter. As indicated hereinabove, antisera which binds CK Bi can also be raised, e.g., generally by the foregoing procedure when the rabbits are injected with the CK BB isoenzyme. Also, other inoculation regimens may be employed, e.g., the rabbits may be administered booster injections every three weeks for a total of four injections, and one may administer, intramuscularly, 0.1 cc pertussis vaccine along with the primary immunization. Example 4Radioimmunoassay Procedure The assay procedure is performed as a double antibody technique with a 12 minute first antibody incubation ,3nd an 8 minute second anti body separation. A. First antibody incubation 0.225 ml total volume. 1. 125I CK Bi 0.1 ml containing 50,000 cpm diluted in 0.5 M phosphate buffered saline PBS , pH 7.4, containing 1 normal rabbit serum. 2. Sample 0.025 ml plasma samples are diluted 1 250 in PBS, pH 7.4. 3. Antibody 0.1 ml of antibody sufficient to give 50 60 binding in 12 minutes dilutions of antibody are made with PBS, pH 7.4. 4. For the Blank Tube, 1 normal rabbit serum is substituted for antiserum. 5. For the 100 Tube Bo , 0.025 ml PBS is substituted for sample. 6. The order of addition is 125I CK Bi sample and antibody. All additions were performed on ice and incubation time begins when placed in a water bath at 37 C. B. Second antibody incubation 0.925 ml total volume. 1. 0.1 ml goat anti rabbit IgG obtained from Arnel Products Company diluted 1 6 in PBS buffer and 100 pl used per reaction tube incubate five minutes at room temperature. 2. 0.6 ml 4.5 polyethylene glycol 6,000 in PBS incubate additional three minutes at room temperature. These additions are performed at room temperature and the tubes vortexed after both additions. After incubation the tubes are centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2,000 x g, the supernates decanted, and the radioactivity present in the residual pellets determined. C. Antibody bound radioactive counts are determined by counting centrifugation derived precipitates in a Searle model 1197 autogamma counter. All standards and unknowns are assayed in triplicate. The standards are prepared by diluting frozen aliquots of CK Bi. It should be noted that when taking human samples, particularly blood samples, the samples should be drawn into a tube containing substances such as ethylene glycol bis aminoethyl ether N,N tetra acetic acid EGTA which functions as an anticoagulant and reducing agent. Blood drawn by venipuncture can be placed in EGTA which will provide a final concentration of 10 mM EGTA. This concentration of the reducing agent provides both anticoagulation and maximizes disaggregation of CK Bi aggregate. It is preferred to run the immunoassay on a sample which contains the maximum amount of CK Bi monomer.Although either blood serum or plasma may be used, it is preferred to use blood plasma in the immunoassay.Example 5Kit The significant reagents for the immunoassay are assembled into a mercantile unit, specifically a kit, for marketing to qualified individuals to run as an assay. The kit should have as the minimum two separate containers, one container holding the antibody recognizingCK Bi and the second container having CK Bi generally as the monomer.Other separate containers may be there such as a container for CK Bi to be used as a standard. Another container can contain the buffer in which the first incubation is carried out. Following the procedure ofExample 4, a technician can correctly assay an unknown sample. The immunoassay procedure described above can be used to assay for the presence of clinical conditions associated with a rise inCK Bi values. The radioimmunoassay utilizing 125I as a label has been used to identify acute myocardial infarction, prostatic carcinoma, and stroke, lung carcinoma, lymphoma, breast carcinoma, colonic carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Its cross reactivity with respect to increasedMM CK measurements, associated with clinical events such as intramuscular injection, exercise, and noncardiovascular surgery, is essentially negligible. The assay has potential for identifying persons who are high risks for myocardial infarct and or sudden death who suffer chest pain but are essentially normal in the other usual test systems such as enzyme activity, electrophoresis, and electrocardiogram.
