# RELIEVING PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL IN VACUUM FILTER

## Abstract
A filter system and method are provided utilizing a filter tank 14 separated into an inlet compartment 17 and a filtrate compartment 18 by a filter media 22 . Under normal filter operation, the liquid to be filtered enters the inlet compartment and is passed through the filter media and out the filtrate compartment by a pressure differential created across the filter media by a pump device 42 . When the need arises to move the filter media as a result of the build up of contaminants on it, it is necessary to alleviate the pressure differential across the filter media. Such pressure differential is alleviated by the controlled flowing of filtered liquid through an orifice 104 in a closed valve 52 into the filtrate compartment.
