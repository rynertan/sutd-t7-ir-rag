# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING HOMOPOLYMERS OR COPOLYMERS OF VINYL OR VINYLIDENE HALIDES BY EMULSION POLYMERIZATION

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for preparing vinyl dispersion resins by conducting the polymerization reaction of the vinyl monomer or monomers in an aqueous alkaline medium, using an oil soluble polymerization initiator, at temperatures preferably below about 48 C, in the presence of an emulsifier system comprising the ammonium salt of a high fatty acid containing from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, at least one long straight chain alcohol containing from 14 to 24 carbon atoms, and a sulfate or sulfonate type soap of C₁₂ to C₂₀ alkyl or aryl hydrocarbons, wherein the ratio of alcohol to emulsifier is equal to or greater than 1.0 and wherein the reaction ingredients are thoroughly mixed, and preferably homogenized, prior to polymerization. The process produces paste reins having improved plastisol foam properties, espe cially when sodium metabisulfite is added to the polymer recipe or the polymer slurry prior to spray drying. Further, polymer buildup in the reactor is substantially reduced and multiple polymerizations can be run in the reactor without opening the same.
