## Description
This invention relates to novel pyrazolo 3,2 c s triazole compounds useful as magenta dye forming couplers in color photographic processes, to a method of making these compounds, and to image dyes formed therefrom. In a common form of color photographic process, developable silver halide grains in a photographic emulsion layer are developed with a color developer solution containing a Pyrazolo 3,2 c s triazole compounds of the general type proposed for use as color couplers may be represented by the general formula We have discovered that pyrazolotriazoles of the formulae We have also discovered that image dyes from the couplers of Formulae III a and b may be further stabilized to light using members of a class of compounds selected from the class of substituted benzene image stabilizers, preferably alkoxybenzene dye image stabilizers, such as described in U.K. Patent Application 2,004,078A. The pyrazolotriazole couplers of the Formulae III a and b , and image dyes obtained from them by color development, are novel compounds and form part of the present invention. A new method of synthesizing these couplers has been devised, and this method, and the 7 cyanopyrazolotriazole compounds used therein, also form part of the inven tion. In the Formulae III a and b , the aryl group or residue R₁ is preferably phenyl or naph thyl. As described hereinafter, R₁ may comprise a ballast moiety, or a second pyrazolotriazole nucleus, in which case it may complete a symmetrical bis pyra zolotriazole. The tertiary alkyl group R₂ prefer ably contains from 4 to 20 carbon atoms and may contain such simple substituents as halogen atoms, alkoxy groups or nitro groups. R₃ is preferably hydrogen, halogen, carboxyl, alkylthio or aryloxy, but any convenient leaving group, also known as a coupling off group, can be used, being introduced in known manner as described in, for instance, U.K. Patent Specification 1,334,515. Further examples of leaving groups are sulfonic acid, acyloxy, amino, arylthio, aryl or heterocyclic azo possibly provid ing coloured couplers and heterocyclic e.g. benzo triazolyl development inhibiting groups. R₄ is preferably an aryl or heterocyclic group, possibly containing such substituents as halogen atoms, alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxyl and nitro groups and sulfonic and carboxylic acid and ester groups. R₄ may also be atoms completing a methine dye. Preferred hetero cyclic groups for R₃, or for inclusion in R₁, R₃ or R₄ comprising 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic rings containing one or more atoms selected from oxygen, sulfur, selenium and nitrogen atoms, these rings possibly being fused with one or more carbocy clic or heterocyclic rings of 5 or 6 members. The new synthetic method of the invention uses, as a starting material, a 2 acyl 3,3 bis methylthio acrylonitrile IV of the formula R₂CO where R₂ is the tertiary alkyl group required for the 6 position of the coupler being made. This starting material can be obtained by reacting carbon disulfide with a compound of formula R₂COCH₂CN to give a compound of formula R₂COC CN C SH ₂ and then treating this with methyl iodide. The substituted acrylonitrile IV is reacted with t butylcarbazate V to give an interme diate VI which is reacted with hydrazine hydrate to produce a substituted pyrazole VII . This can be treated with a concentrated acid such as hydrochloric acid to give a 3 5 hydrazinopyrazole VIII from which a pyrazolo 3,2 c s triazole can be prepared by known procedures. Procedures appropriate for obtaining a 3 aryl pyra zolo 3,2 c s triazole from the intermediate VIII include reaction with an aromatic aldehyde ArCHO IX or acid chloride ArCOCl X , followed by ring closure, which can be effected using bromine and sodium acetate in acetic acid or phosphorus oxychloride in an inert solvent. The reactions are as follows The cyano group can be removed from the 7 position by hydrolysis and decarboxylation As is well known, ballast groups can readily be attached by providing an amino group in the coupler at the desired point of attachment and reacting this with a carbonylhalide substituted ballast molecule. In this way ballast groups such as those of the general formulae Specific examples of the new pyrazolo 3,2 c s triazole couplers are the following compounds, which are numbered for convenience of reference in the examples hereinafter. The described couplers can be used in the ways and for the purposes that couplers are used in the photographic art. The novel couplers of the invention can be incorporated in a sensitive silver halide photographic material by any convenient method, the method chosen depending on the solubility and diffusion resistance of the coupler concerned. References to publications describing methods of coupler incorporation are given in Section XIV of the The novel dyes obtained by reaction between the couplers of this invention and the oxidation products of the usual Examples of dyes of the invention are given in Table 2. They are designated 1 CD3 and so on, being obtained from the couplers 1 to 7 of Table 1 by reaction with the oxidation product of the well known color developing agents CD 3. The latter has the formula The spectral absorption parameters quoted for each dye in TABLE 2 refer to dyes generated in coatings of the appropriate coupler as described in Example 1 below. The following examples illustrate the invention. Coupler 1.28 mmole and an equal weight of di n butylphthalate were dissolved in ethyl acetate 1 g and the resulting solution was added to 10 aqueous gelatin 20 g at 40 C. A small amount of surfactant di isopropyl naphthalene sulfonic acid, sodium salt was added and the mixture dispersed using an ultrasonic probe. Finally the weight was made up to 25 g with water. In some instances the addition of cyclohexanone 0.5 g was required to dissolve the coupler. Coating melts were prepared by adding to each dispersion 71.8 g of a standard silver chloro bromide photographic emulsion 1.4 Ag, 5.6 Gel . Appropriate quantities of a gelatin hardener bis vinylsulfonylmethyl ether, BVSME and a spreading agent were added immediately before coating, giving a total melt volume of 100 ml. Melts were coated on a transparent support at a coverage of 54 ml.m ², and the coatings were allowed to dry under ambient conditions. A protective gelatin supercoat was then applied in the same fashion, giving coatings of the structure below. The coatings had the following coverages Further coatings were prepared containing stabilizers in addition to the couplers. The preparation of these coatings followed the procedure outlined in Part a except that equimolar quantities of coupler and stabilizer were added to the ethyl acetate n butylphthalate solutions. Test coupler coatings, prepared as described above, were exposed so as to obtain, after photo graphic development, sample strips having a trans mission density of approximately 1.0 at the wave length of maximum absorption λmax . Photographic development was carried out with conventional color developer and bleach fix solutions, yielding the corresponding CD 3 coupled dye from each coupler. CD 3 is the sesquisulfate monhydrate of the develop ing agent of the Formula XIV in which R₂₀ is CH₃SO₂NHCH₂CH₂ , R₂₁ is C₂H₅ and R₂₂ is a methyl group The sample strips were then exposed to a high intensity fluorescent light source Osram trademark Color Matching tubes at a luminous flux level of 13 klux. After suitable times the strips were removed and the absorption spectrum re measured, as before. The decrease in density at λmax was used as a measure of the fade of each sample dye. Table 3 is a compilation of the measured fades for dyes derived from pairs of pyrazolotriazole couplers, differing only in the substituent in the 6 position of the pyrazolotriazole nucleus. The couplers of the invention Nos. 2 6 are identified in Table 1. The corresponding comparison couplers, having a methyl instead of a t butyl group at the 6 position, are designated 2C to 6C. Following the method described in Example 1 coatings were prepared of the Coupler 7 with and without equimolar amounts of the chromanol compound S1 . Light stability measurements were carried out on the image dyes, as described in Part c of Example 1. The results see table below showed that the stability of the dye was significantly decreased in the presence of the chromanol. The experiment of Part a was repeated using the tetraalkoxybenzene stabilizer S2 instead of the chromanol S1. In this instance the stability of the dye produced from the coupler was found to be increased by the presence of the addendum, as shown below. The experiment of Example 2 a was repeated using Coupler 4 instead of Coupler 7, and the title compound S3 instead of the chromanol addendum. The results shown below demonstrated that the presence of S3 reduced the rate of fade of the dye produced from Coupler 4. The experiment of Example 3 was repeated using the title compound S4 instead of 1,2,3,4 tetrabutoxybenzene S3 . As in Examples 2 b and 3, stabilization of the dye was observed in the presence of the addendum. The results are shown below.
