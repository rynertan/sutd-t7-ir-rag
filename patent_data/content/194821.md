# Infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable transmission in which the pitches of a driving pulley 7 and a driven pulley 8 are variable by means of hydraulic fluid pressure to vary the velocity ratio between the two pulleys. A lower pressure fluid and a higher pressure fluid are created from a hydraulic fluid from a hydraulic fluid supply source 68 , with a constant pressure difference therebetween. The lower pressure fluid has its pressure value varied in response to the velocity ratio. The lower pressure fluid and the higher pressure fluid are selectively supplied to the movable pulley elements 23,32 of the driving pulley and driven pulley. A hydraulic clutch 4 and a pressure regulating valve 166 are connected together by a hydraulic fluid supply passageway 124 which is selectively closed and opened by a supply control valve 167 . A drain passage 183 is connected to the hydraulic fluid supply passageway to allow hydraulic fluid to escape from the hydraulic clutch when the passageway is closed by the supply control valve. In at least one movable pulley element, an orifice 333, 358 is formed through a sealing element 327, 352 which seals between an inner peripheral surface 22c¹, 32c¹ of a cylindrical portion 22c, 32c and a radially extending annular flange 23b, 33b of a stationary piston element 23, 33 to communicate between first and second hydraulic pressure chambers 24,35,25,36 defined within an annular space s, s¹ in a pulley main body 22b,32b at opposite sides of the annular flange of the stationary piston element.
