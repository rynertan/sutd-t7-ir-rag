# Tracking control system.

## Abstract
A tracking control system comprises a capstan motor 19 for moving a magnetic tape 21 which is at least recorded with an FM signal and a control signal having a constant period, a driving circuit 18 for generating a signal which drives the capstan motor, a control head 20 for reproducing the control signal from the tape in a reproducing mode, heads 22 for reproducing the FM signal from the tape in the reproducing mode, a tracking adjuster 27 for generating a comparison signal, a phase comparator 17 for comparing phases of the reproduced control signal with the comparison signal and for generating a phase error signal which is supplied to the driving circuit to control the driving circuit, a sampling circuit 24 for sampling a signal which is based on the reproduced FM signal with a present sampling interval, a discriminating circuit 25 for discriminating levels of sampled data obtained from the sampling circuit, and a circuit 26 for generating a control signal based on a discriminated result in the discriminating circuit and for supplying the control signal to the tracking adjuster to automatically and variably control a duty cycle of the comparison signal so that an envelope level of the repro duced FM signal becomes a maximum.
