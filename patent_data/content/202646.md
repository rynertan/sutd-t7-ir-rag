# Input protection device.

## Abstract
An input protection device 34 for a semiconductor inte grated circuit, comprising a semiconductor substrate 24 of one conductivity type, a first insulator 26 layer formed on the substrate and having an opening 40 extending to the surface of the substrate, a doped region 42 formed in the opening for contacting the substrate, the doped region being of the other conductivity type and forming a p n junction at its interface with the substrate, an input protection resistor region 17 having a portion contacting the doped region through the opening in the first insulator layer and a portion overlapping the first insulator layer, a second insulator layer 30 having a portion covering the input protection resistor region, the por tion of the second insulator layer having an opening 28 extending to the surface of the resistor region, the opening in the second insulator layer being at least in part in registry with the opening in the first insulator layer, and a metallized input wiring layer 32 formed on the second insulator layer and having a region extending through the opening in the second insulator layer to the surface of the protection resistor region. The p n junciion formed between the substrate and the doped region provides a diode 36 to be reverse biased by the voltage to be normally applied to the input transistor and is operative to pass therethrough a current with a high voltage surge.
