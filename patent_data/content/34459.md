# Cereal grain moisture content measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
A cereal grain moisture content measuring apparatus including a vessel 8 for containing a sample of cereal grains to be measured for its moisture content formed with a dis charge valve 19 at its bottom, an electrostatic capacity sen sor 18 mounted on an inner wall surface of the vessel 8 , a weighing device 7 connected to the vessel 8 and a grain feeding device 5, 6 mounted above the vessel 8 . Electric circuits of the weighing device 7 and the grain feeding device 5, 6 are operatively connected to an electric circuit of the sensor 18 through a control circuit A, A . The weighing device 7 is adapted either to measure the weight of a pre determined volume of cereal grains, or to measure the weight of a predetermined weight of cereal grains and produce a signal to actuate a volume measuring section 33 provided to said vessel to determine the volume of the cereal grains of the predetermined weight. The moisture content sensed by the sensor 18 is corrected by a control circuit A, A in terms of a predetermined density of cereal grains based on the meas ured weight or volume of cereal grains in the vessel 8
