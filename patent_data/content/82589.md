# Series damper dynamic lag system.

## Abstract
A vibration damper 10 with a built in self energizing lag system adapted to reduce the tip in and tip out effects of automotive lock up torque converters for an automatic transmission. The lag system comprises a friction lag plate 58 having a generally wedge shape that is received in a complementary notch 21 formed in the outer surface of each hub arm 16 of the vibration damper and will be urged outwardly by centrifugal force to slide in a channel 57 formed in the housing for the damper to offer a resistance to movement of the hub that is proportional to the centrifugal force resulting from engine rpm.
