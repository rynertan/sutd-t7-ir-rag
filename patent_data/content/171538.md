# COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESSES FOR COATING FERROUS SURFACES WITH COPPER

## Abstract
Aqueous copper coating compositions, solid composi tions for forming the aqueous compositions, and processes for coating the surfaces of ferrous containing materials by contacting said surfaces with the aqueous copper coating compositions, wherein the aqueous compositions contain a from about 10 to about 30 grams liter of cupric ions b from about 1 to about 10 grams liter of chloride ions c from about 0.1 to about 10 grams liter of at least one aminepolyacetic acid compound and d either i from about 0.01 to about 10 grams liter of acriflavine hydrochloride and from about 0.1 to about 20 grams liter of a polyalkylene oxide C₁₂ C₁₈ alkyl or alkenyl amine or ii from about 0.1 to about 10 grams liter of the reaction product of ortho toluidine and formaldehyde
