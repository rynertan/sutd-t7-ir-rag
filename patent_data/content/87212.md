# Method of and apparatus for the automatic diagnosis of the failure of electrical devices connected to common bus nodes and the like.

## Abstract
This disclosure is concerned with the automatic diagno sis of the failure of tri state, two state and other electrical or electronic devices or components connected to common bus nodes through the pulling of such nodes to high or low voltage state levels during the disabling of all devices connected to the common bus node s in order to determine if a failed device is interfering with the normal bus operation and if so, to proceed automatically to compare parametric measurements of the failed common bus node s with purposefully failed selected devices, one by one, to locate the device interfering with the normal bus operation.
