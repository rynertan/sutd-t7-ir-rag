# Electrical resistors and method of making same.

## Abstract
An electrical resistor is described which is comprised of a resistor core having at least one electrically conductive end cap mounted thereon. The end cap is in electrical contact with the butt end portion of the core and electrically insulated from the side, or periphery, portion of the core member. The end cap has an outward extending radial portion thereon, positioned contiguous to the junction between the core and the cap. The present electrical resistors are produced by forming a resistive core member of a conductor in a dielectric matrix material and an end cap, having an internal contact surface and a receiving portion. The receiving portion is larger than the outside diameter of the core. The end cap has and outward extending radial position adjacent the receiving portion. The end cap is mounted on the core to place the butt end portion of the core in electrical contact with the internal contact surface of the end cap, but otherwise spacedly within the end cap. The space between the receiving end of the cap and the side portion of the core is filled with an electrically insulating material, for example, a thermosetting resin.
