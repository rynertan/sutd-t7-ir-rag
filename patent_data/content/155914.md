# Device for stabilizing and differentiating glasses or similar light containers.

## Abstract
The present invention consists in a system to keep glasses or other containers in plastics, paper or some other light material, even if empty, from overturning. Is is a ring shaped object, suitably moulded, in the proper weight and of the conveniently calibrated inside diametre so as to receive and firmly fasten a glass at its base, thus becoming one thing only with it. Besides, if realized in various colours, it makes it possible for the person who is using it to easily single out his own glass among many others.

## Claims
CLAIMS. 1 The system of stabilizing glasses or other containors in light material, whatever aro thoir diametre and shapes by lowering their barycentre. 2 A device well fitted for the realization of the system mention ed at above point 1 , characterized by a ring shaped structure moulded in such a way as to receive and firmly fasten glasses and any other containers as a consequence of the r elastic strain. 3 A system for singling out glasses or other containers by virtue of the chromatic differentiation of the device mentioned at the above claim no. 2.

## Description
DESCRIPTION.GLASSFIX A RING ABLE TC STABILIZE AND DIFFERENTIATE GLASSES OR OTH R CONTAINERS IN LIGHT NATERIAL.Single use light plastics or paper glasses commonly used in in formal parties, picnics etc. present a few not negligible draw backs, among which, for example owing to their very light tit they can be easily overturned even simply by an awkward movement or a breath of wind and there for they may stain table clothes, dresses etc. with their con tents being shed all around as they are preferably used at crowded and lively meetings, the fact that they cannot be distinguished from one another inevita bly causes discomfort and waste of glasses, for the person who is using a glass of this kind will look for a claan one every time he feels like drinking.The two abovementioned inconveniences are enough to give an idea of how GLASSFIX will prove advantageous from both an economical and a practical point of view. GLASSFIX is a ring shaped object of suitably calibrated diametres which, o es it is applied to the bas of a plastics or paper glass, becomes one thins only with it and by widening its sup porting base and lowering its barycentre it becomes the determin ing factor of its steadiness.The diametres inside as ell as outside the material adopt ed and the wGi√ßht of GLASSFIX have been specially selected to this aim. No other similar system is known at present which may guaran tee the same satisfactory result.The invention is better illustrated hereafter by help of a draw ing in full size scale and of a zerographic reproduction.
