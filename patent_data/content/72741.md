# Programmable gain integrator stage including means for offset voltage elimination.

## Abstract
A switched capacitor gain stage 110, 120 having a programmable gain factor. This gain factor is determined by the connection of desired gain determining components 14 17 25 28 contained within a component array 100, 101 . A sample and hold circuit 46 is provided for the storage of the error voltage of the entire gain integrator stage. This stored error voltage V
