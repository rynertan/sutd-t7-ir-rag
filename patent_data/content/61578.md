# Process for producing hydrogen.

## Abstract
Hydrogen is generated by contacting an alkaline aqueous solution of formaldehyde with at least one catalyst selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, tung sten, molybdenum carbides, tungsten carbides, molybde num nitrides, tungstenum borides, copper, silver, gold and compounds of copper, silver and gold. Hydrogen can be generated at ambient temperature under atmospheric pressure and, therefore, complicated steps or complicated devices are unnecessary.
