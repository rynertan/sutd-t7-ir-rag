# Liquid developer for development of electrostatic images.

## Abstract
A liquid developer composition that is suitable for rendering visible electrostatically charged area which com position contains in an electrically insulating non polar carrier liquid having a volume resistivity of at least 10‚Åπ ohm.cm and a dielectric constant less than 3 dispersed colouring matter acting as toner particles and at least one onium salt polymer including recurring units incorporating an onium group together with a counter anion, characterized in that the said anion has at least one of the characteristics 1 to 4 1 contains a negatively charged atom or group of atoms which is sterically embraced by at least two non ionic substituents containing at least 4 C atoms 2 contains a negatively charged atom which is steric ally embraced by at least 4 atoms selected from the group consisting of oxygen and halogen 3 contains a negatively charged atom or group of atoms the negative charge of which is delocalized over other atoms linked to said atom or group of atoms 4 is a radical anion, whereby the said polymer is adsorbed with a net positive charge on the toner particles.
