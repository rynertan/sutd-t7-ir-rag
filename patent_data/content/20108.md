# Apparatus and method for container recognition.

## Abstract
A container 11 which is to be recognized is carried through an illumination station 10 by a conveyor, and the conveyor generates conveyor clock pulses corresponding to actual movement of the container through the illumination station. A trigger photodetector 17 senses the leading edge 28 of the container and generates a trigger signal which enables a counter to begin counting conveyor clock pulses. Registration photodetectors 18 are positioned downstream from the trigger photodetector and are connected for terminating the counting of conveyor clock pulses upon detection of the container leading edge at their respective positions. Height detecting photodetectors 19 perform a height classification at the instant of activation of the trigger photodetector. The system includes a plurality of recognition circuits for recognizing different classes of containers, and the height classification is used for selecting those recognition circuits to be employed for recognition of the particular container being observed.
