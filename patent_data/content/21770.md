## Description
A THERMO SETTING POWDER CONTAINING COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAME This invention relates to improved thermosetting powder paints and more particularly pertains to polvmeric glycoluril derivatives for cross linking reactive polymers having reactive hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide groups upon exposure to heat. Powder paints are ordinarily manufactured from raw batch ingredients comprising resinous binders, opacifying and filler pigmentary solids, plasticizers, and other additives to provide opacity, good film properties, and adhesion to substrates. The raw batch ingredients are uniformly mixed, formed into coherent extrudate by hot extrusion, and then comminuted to form small particle powder paints which are ordinarily free flowing at normal room temperature. Powder paints usually are uniform small powders passing 325 mesh or less than about 44 microns.Powder paints contain little or no fugitive solvents and depend upon their own inherent characteristics of the powder to melt, level, coalesce, and fuse to form an attractive coherent film on the substrate. The powder must not fuse in the container and cannot be subjected to cold flow so as to maintain individual powder particles prior to use. In recent years, thermosetting powder paints have become particularly suitable for use in commercial industrial process particularly since powder paints are essentially free of organic solvents whereby economic and social benefits are achieved by reduced air pollution, reduced energy use, and reduced health and fire hazards.Present commercial powder coatings often exhibit poor weathering properties although some expensive powder paints can obtain satisfactory weathering. Other difficulties often encountered in powder paints are caking or blocking of the powder in use and other mechanical application properties. Recently issued U.S. Patent No. 4,118,437 andU.S. Patent No. 4,064,191 disclose cross linkable powder coatings wherein the cross linkng component is an alkylated glycoluril derivative. It now has been found that an economical and substantially improved powder coating composition can be achieved by utilizing a polymeric cross linker comprising an alkoxy methyl or methylol functional polymer produced by copolymerizing a glycoluril with a diol or another glycoluril. The polymeric glycoluril can comprise as low as 10 by weight of the thermosetting powder coating binder composition which exhibits excellent minimum tack greater than 700C and particularly important for nonfusing and non blocking powder coatings. A preferred aspect.of the invention pertains to a single component self curing polymer comprising a moderately low molecular weight polymer containing methylol and or tetramethylol groups which are coreacting with preferably hydroxyl groups on the same polymer. Briefly, the invention pertains to a powder coating composition comprising on weight basis a mixture of 10 to 70 of a polymeric glycoluril cross linker, and 30 to 90 of a reactive polymer whereby the polymeric glycoluril cross links with reactive hydroxyl, carboxyl, and or amide groups upon exposure to heat. Preferred compositions are based on a self curing polymer containing methylol and or alkoxy groups adapted to cross link with coreactive hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide groups on the same plymer. Figure 1 illustrates the tack temperatures as a function of matrix polymer cross linking component and compares compositions of this invention with prior art compositions This invention pertains to thermosetting powder coatings primarily based upon a polymeric glycoluril cross linking polymer adapted to cross link a reactive matrix polymer upon application of heat. Referring first to the Drawings, Figure 1 illustrates the tack temperature as a function of matrix polymer cross linking component for compositions of this invention as well as prior art compositions. The x axis in Figure 1 indicates a weight ratio of matrix polymer cross linker wherein the cross linking components are varied. Curve A ilustrates the composition of this invention based on a polymeric glycoluril cross linker. CurveB illustrates the same composition containing a monomeric glycoluril cross linker in accordance with U.S. PatentNo. 4,118,437. Curve C similarly illustrates a melamine cross linker consisting of hexamethoxymethyl melamine cymel 300 . The highly desirable Curve A provides approximately a consistent flat curve relative to CurvesB and C which progressively depress tack temperatures and consequently increase undesirable caking or agglomeration of powder. Referring next to the polymeric glycoluril cross linker, the glycoluril polymer is alkoxy methyl or alkoxy methylol polymer having a molecular weight between 500 and 5000 and preferably between 600 and 1500. The glycoluril polymer can be formed by self condensation of tetra alkoxy methyl glycoluril and or a tetra methylol glycoluril, or a consensation copolymer of a diol or diacid or diamide or polyme diol or polymer diacid or diamide with a tetra alkoxy methyl glycoluril and or a tetramethylol glycoluril wherein the resulting glycoluril poly me contains reactive methylol or alkoxy methyl groups.Diols ae preferred and suitable diols for the copolymer can include simple monomer diols such as glycols, low molecular weight polyester diols, and polyurethane diols such as for example, hydrogenated bisphenol A, cyclohexane dimethanol, and neopentyl terephthalate. The low molecular weight diols can be advantageously utilized to increase the molecular weight of the polymeric glycoluril to achieve highly desirable tack temperatures above about 700C which are necessary to prevent caking and blocking of the powder paint particles. Preferably, the finished powder paint has a tack temperature in the range of 750C to 950C.Suitable monomeric diols ordinarily are free of alkyl ether groups, are liquid although can have melting points as high as 1500C, a hydroxyl content by weight of 10 to 55 , and molecular weights between about 60 and 350. Polyester diols can have a resin tack temperature of about 400C to 700C, hydroxyl of 3 to 15 by weight, and molecular weight between about 200 and 1000. Gycoluril copolymers containing copolymerized diols can contain between 10 and 70 by weight diol copolymerized with alkoxy methyl or methylol glycoluril. Self condensation glycoluril polymer can be produced by homopolymerizing units of tetra alkoxy methyl glycoluril, or homopolymerizing tetra methylol glycoluril, or by copolymerizing a tetra alkoxy methyl glycoluril and a tetra methylol glycoluril. In either the diol copolymer or the self condenstion polymers, and alkoxy methyl groups and or the methylol groups comprise between about 5 and 40 by weight of the polymeric glycoluril cross linking component. Glycolurils are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.4,064,191 and are also known as acetylenediureas, Glycolurils are derived by reacting two moles of urea with one mole of glyoxal to provide a complex ring structure illustrated as follows EMI4.1 The foregoing glycoluril is referred to as G in the following polymeric structures illustrating the polymeric glycoluril in accordance with invention. The preparation of various glycolurils is illustrated in U.S. Patent No.4,064,191 such as tetra methylol glycoluril, tetrabutoxymethyl glycoluril, partially methylolated glycoluril, tetramethoxymethyl glycoluril, and dimethoxydiethoxy glycoluril. Useful glycoluril derivatives include for example, mono and dimethylether of dimethylol glycoluril, the trimethylether of tetramethylol glycoluril, the tetramethylether of tetramethylol glycoluril, tetrakisethoxymethyl glycoluril, tetrakisopropoxymethyl glycoluril, tetrakisbutoxymethyl glycoluril, tetrakisamyloxymethyl glycoluril, tetrakishexoxymethyl glycoluril and the like.A self condensate glycolnril polymer can be illustrated as follows wherein EMI5.1 G said glycoluril structure R1 H or alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms R or r CH2 O CH2 n 1 to 5 units Similarly, a diol condensate copolymer is illustrated asEMI5.2 tb follows SEP CµH2 R1I tb R1OCH2 3 SEP SEP G SEP 2 SEP O SEP SEP R3 SEP SEP O SEP SEP CH2 SEP SEP G SEP CH20R1 tb SEP a SEP CH20Rt tb wherein G said glycoluril structure R1 H or alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms R3 diol with hydroxyl groups removed n 1 to 4 unitsThus, the polymeric glycoluril contains at least two polymerized glycoluril monomer units to provide a polymer chain containing at least two glycoluril structures G .The molecular weight of useful polymeric glycoluril condensate polymers is between 500 and 5000 and preferably between 600 and 1500. The polymeric glycoluril provides an excellent cross linking component for reactive matrix polymers in powder coating compositions. Preparation of the polymeric glycoluril can be facilitated by the inclusion of between 0.52 and 5 by weight acid catalyst. Amine or ammonia can be added to buffer the acid catalyst and moderate the reaction rate whereby the acid catalyst is neutralized up to about 300 .The rate of reaction can be varied depending on the acid and amine strength, the degree of neutralization, and the level of acid catalyst used. Acid can be added first to promote the reaction and then amine can be added to control and prevent further reaction while the polymer is being discharged. Referring next to the reactive polymer adapted to be cross linked by the polymeric glycoluril crosslinker, the reactive polymer can be a polymer having reactive hydroxyls, or carboxylsr or amide groups. The polymer can have a molecular weight between about 100 and 100,000 and contains by weight between 1 and 50 reactive carboxyl, hydroxyl or amide groups, or combinations thereof.These reactive groups are adapted to react with the methylol and or alkoxy methyl groups on the polymeric glycoluril. Generally, the polymers can be epoxy polymers, polyester polymer, acrylic polymers, phenolic polymers, vinyl polymers, and similar polymers, provided such polymers have a tack temperature above 750C to provide adequate storage stability and prevent caking. A tack temperature is the lowest temperature above which dry solid polymer particles tend to cake or block within a 60 second time period. The reactive polymers are preferably polymers with a melt temperature or Table about 750C generally between 800C and 2000C, and preferably between 1000C and 1400C.All polymers can have reactive hydroxyl, carboxyl or amide groups attached to the polymer such as by esterification in polyester polymer or by addition polymerization of carboxyl or hydroxyl monomers in acrylic or vinyl polymers.Particularly preferred reactive polymers contain reactive hydroxyl groups. Hydroxyl or carboxyl terminated polyester polymers can be produced by an esterification reaction of glycols together with saturated, unsaturated, aliphatic, or aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic,isophthalic, terephthalic, maleic, fumaric, succinic, adipic, azelaic, malonic and similar dicarboxylic acids. The preferred glycols are aliphatic glycols such as 1,3 butylene glycol or 1,4 butylene glycol ethylene glycol and propylene glycol neopentyl glycol as well as minor amounts of polyols such as trimethylol propane or ethane, or petaerythritol. The glycols are reacted with the dicarboxylic acids at temperatures preferably above about 2000C to substantially coreact all the available carboxylic acid to provide a hydroxyl polyester.Conversely, excess dicarboxylic acid is reacted completely with lesser equivalents of polyol to provide a carboxyl terminated polyester polymer.The excess glycol or carboxylic component can be about 20 to 100 molar equivalent excess of the other component to provide a hydroxyl or carboxyl terminated polyester adapted to be cross linked by the polymeric glycoluril component.Vinyl and acrylic polymers produced from copolymerization of ethylenic monomers can contain reactive hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide groups by copolymerizing minor amounts of functional ethylenic monomers such as acrylic or methacrylic acid for carboxyl groups, hydroxyethyl, or hydroxy propyl acrylate or similar hydroxyl alkyl acrylates or methacrylates to provide for hydroxyl groups, and acrylamide or similar alkylamides for amide groups. Epoxy and phenolic polymers can have reactive functional groups esterified or grafted onto the polymer chain to provide a reactive polymer. Reactive polymers in accordance with this invention contain between 1 and 50 by weight functional hydroxyl, carboxyl, and or amide groups, and preferably 1 to 12 of said reactive functional groups. The polymeric glycoluril cross linker and the reactive polymer can be combined to provide a homogeneous mixture on a weight basis of preferably 10 to 70 of polymeric glycoluril mixed with 30 to 90 reactive polymer.The most preferred and optimized combination comprises 10 to 30 polymeric glycoluril and 70 to 90 reactive polymer.The combination exhibits a tack temperature of at least 700C. The polymeric glycoluril and the reactive polymer can be thoroughly and uniformly mixed by mildly heating the solid materials with pigmentary solids, plasticizers and other components to uniformly blend the polymeric components with the pigmentary solids. Pigments can ordinarily include opacifying pigments such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, leaded zinc oxide, titanium calcium, as well as tinting pigment such as carbon black, yellow oxides, brown oxides, tan oxides, raw and burnt sienna or umber, chromium oxide green, phthalocyanine green, phthalonitrile blue, ultra marine blue, cadmium pigments, chromium pigments, and the like. Filler pigments such as clay, silica, talc, mica, wollastonite, wood flower and the like can be added. The raw batch ingredients can be thoroughly premixed in a high intensity mixer such as a high speed dry blender whereby the materials are discharged in a uniform mixture. The high intensity mixer discharges the batch components to a heated screw extruder wherein the extruder is internally heated by an indirect heating fluid such as steam, hot water, or synthetic oil whereupon the exit extruder temperature is regulated according to the type of powder paint being produced but generally is between about 900C and 1500C at the heated exit die of the screw fed extruder. The extrudate emerges from the extruder as a rope which is chilled and squeezed to a thin ribbon by cooling rolls then passes onto a watercooled stainless steel conveyor belt whereby the plastic ribbon extrudate fully hardens.The cooled extrudate then passes through a mechanical comminuter disposed at the end of the cocled stainless steel belt to efficiently break the fragile brittle ribbon into very small flakesThe small flakes are then discharged into a cooled mill, such as a hammer mill, to grind the small flakes into powder paint of less than 325 mesh and preferably passing a 200 mesh U.S. Standard Sieve Screen whereupon the powder can be further classified into particle size if desired.The resulting powder coatings advantageously exhibit a tack temperature well above 700C whereby the dry powder does not cake or block, can be easily spray applied, and fused with moderate heat to provide a thermoset continuous surface coating. The powder paints in accordance with this invention can be applied to a steel panel substrate and moderately heated between temperatures of about 1400C and 2050C for 5 to 30 minutes to obtain desirable flow out and cure. The advantages of this invention are further illustrated in the following examples. The preferred paint of this invention is primarily based on a single component, self curing glycoluril polymer by partial condensation of tetramethylol and or tetraalkoxy methyl glycoluril preferably with a poly hydroxy or carboxyl, oramide material on a weight proportion to provide broadly a ratio of 1 2 to 2 1 equivalents of reactive glycoluril functions to reactive hydroxyls or carboxyls or am des . F ji approximate 1 1 equivalent ratio of methylol and or alkoxy methyl groups to reactive hydroxyl groups is preferred Thus, the single component self curing polymer contains at least 1.0 methylol and or alkoxy methyl group and at least 1.0 other reactive group of hydroxyl and or carboxyl and or amide group per polymer unit.Preferably, the self curing, single component polymer contains between 2 and 8 total reactive groups per polymer unit.The molecular weight of the final single component resin is between about 400 and 4000 and preferably between 800 and 25to, The methylol and or alkoxy methyl equivalent weight of the self curing polymer can be between 200 and 2500 and preferably between 400 and 1500. The self curing glycoluril polymer can be illustrated structurally as follows where,EMI10.1 R Polyol minus hydroxyls P1 H or Cl C4alky m 0 2 n 0 1 p 0 1 2m 3p 1 4 mn 1 1 4 Ratio 0.5 2.0, preferably 0.8 1.2 The polyfunctional reactive component for copolymerizing with the foregoing glycoluril to provide a single component self curing polymer is preferably a poly hydroxy material such as a simple diol, triol, tetrol and similar simple polyols such as glycols, low molecular weight polyester diols, hydrogenated bisphenol A, and 1 4 cyclohexane dimethanol and polymeric polyols such as polyester polyols, hydroxyl functional acrylics, styrene allyl alcohols copolymers and similar hydroxy polymers.Generally, the polymers can be epoxy polymers, polyester polymer, acrylic polymers, phenolic polymers, vinyl polymers, and similar polymers, provided such polymers result in a final tack temperature above 750C for the final condensate to provide adequate storage stability and prevent caking. A tack temperature is the lowest temperature above which dry solid polymer particles tend to cake or block within a 60 second time period. The reactive hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide component can contain reactive functional equivalent between about 2 and 6 reactive groups per molecular and preferably, 2 to 3 reactive groups per molecule. The molecular weight of the reactive functional component can be between 62 and 3000 and preferably between 62 and 2000. The reactive hydroxyl component carboxyl, amide can be simple monomeric units or oligmeric units or low molecular weight polymeric units.Hydroxyl or carboxyl terminated polyester polymers can be produced by an esterification reaction of glycols together with saturated, unsaturated, aliphatic, or aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic, isophthalic,terephthalic1iic,furnaric, succinic, adipic, azelaic, malonic and similar dicarboxylic acids. The preferred glycols are aliphatic glycols such as 1,3 butylene glycol or 1,4 butylene glycol ethylene glycol and propylene glycols neopentyl glycol as well as minor amounts of polyols such as trimethylol propane or ethane, or pentaerythritol. The glycols are reacted with the dicarboxylic acids at temperatures preferably above about 2000C to substantially coreact all the available carboxylic acid to provide a hydroxyl polyester.Conversely, excess dicarboxylic acid is reacted completely with lesser equivalents of polyol to provide a carboxyl terminated polyester polymer. Vinyl and acrylic polymers produced from copolymerization of ethylenic monomers can contain reactive hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide groups by copolymerizing minor amounts of functional ethylenic monomers such as acrylic or methacrylic acid for carboxyl groups, hydroxyethyl, or hydroxypropyl acrylate or similar hydroxy alkyl acrylates or methacrylates to provide for hydroxyl groups, and acrylamide or similar amides for amide groups.Epoxy and phenolic polymers can have reactive functional groups esterified or grafted onto the polymer chain to provide a reactive polymer. The self curing glycoluril copolymer contains at least 1 methylol and or alkoxy methyl group and at least 1 hydroxyl carboxyl, amide group per copolymer unit molecule and preferably, in a 1 to 1 ratio. Thus, the copolymer contains at least twototal coreactive groups but not more than 8 total core active groups per copolymer unit whereon at least one group is a methylol or alkoxy methyl and at least one group is a coreactive hydroxyl, carboxyl and or amide group. The molecular weight of the self curing polymer is between about 400 and 4000 and preferably, 200 to 2500. On a weight basis, the selfcuring polymer contains between 8 and 70 glycoluril compound and the remaining being copolymerized component containing reactive hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide groups.The combined methylol and or alkoxy methyl equivalent weight can be between 150 and 5000 and preferably between 500 and 2000. The hydroxyl carboxyl, amide equivalent weight can be between 200 and 2500 and preferably between 400 and 1500. In accordance with the process of this invention, the self curing glycoluril copolymer can be synthesized in the presence of an acid catalyst by partial condensation of a tetra methylol and or tetra alkoxy methyl with a hydroxyl, carboxyl, or amide containing polymer. The acid catalyst preferably is a strong acid catalyst such as a sulphonic acid and the reaction temperature can be between about 1200C and 2000C and preferably between about 1400C and 1800C. the amount of acid catalyst added is based upon the amount of glycoluril compound and generally in the amount of O.02 to 0.2 acid equivalents per 1000 grams of glycoluril compound. An amine buffer can be used in conjunction with the acid to properly control the reaction rate. Additional amine can be added to stabilize the resin toward the end of the reaction and during the discharge of the finished resinous polymer. The amount of organic amine can be in amounts equivalent to about 0 to 0.4 base equivalents per 1000 grams of glycoluril compound. A suitable equivalent ratio of base to acid in the reaction mixture can be between 1 to 2 equivalent parts base acid to achieve polymer stability during discharge. At the desired end point, the removal of by product alcohol can be terminated by stopping the distillation and then add additioaal amine to neutralize the acid catalyst and effectively prevent further polymerization.A versatile aspect of the process of this invention is that the alcohol portion of the starting alkoxy methyl glycoluril compound can be displaced by a higher boiling alcohol which can be added to the reaction mixture along with the poly hydroxy material. A higher boiling alcohol for instance, can displace the alkoxy group totally or partially and can be utilized to prevent gassing during the curing step which can result in pinholes in the cured film. Useful higher boiling alcohols for degassing are usually ring type alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, benzoin and cyclohexanol. The type and the amount of alcohol can be determined relative to the tack temperature depressant effect such alcohol may have on the finished resin composition. The self cross linking polymer can be thoroughly and uniformly mixed by mildly heating the solid materials with pigmentary solids, plasticizers, and other components to uniformly blend the components. Pigments can ordinarily include opacifying pigments such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, leaded zinc oxide, titanium calcium, as well as tinting pigment such as carbon black, yellow oxides, brown oxides, tan oxides, raw and burnt sienna or umber, chromium oxide green, pthalocyanine green, phthalonitrile blue, ultra marine blue, cadmium pigments, chromium pigments, and the like. Filler pigments such as clay, silica, talc, mica, wollastonite, wood flower and the like can be added. The raw batch ingredients can be thoroughly premixed in a high intensity mixer such as a high speed dry blender whereby the materials are discharged in a uniform mixture.The high intensity mixer discharges the batch components to a heated screw extruder wherein the extruder is internally heated by an indirect heating fluid such as steam, hot water, or synthetic oil whereupon the exit extruder temperature is regulated according to the type of powder paint being produced but generally is between about 900C and 1500C at the heated exited die of the stew fed extruder. The extrudate era rges from the extruder as a rope which is chilled and squeezed to a thin ribbon by cooling rolls then passes onto a water cooled stainless steel conveyor belt whereby the plastic ribbon extrudate fully hardens.The cooled extrudate then passes through a mechanical comminutor disposed at the end of the cooled stainless steel belt to efficiently break the fragile brittle ribbon into very small flakes. The small flakes are then discharged into a cooled mill, such as a hammer mill, to grind the small particles into powder paint of less than 325 mesh and preferably passing a 200 mesh U.S. Standard SieveScreen whereupon the powder can be further classified into particle size if desired. The resulting powder coatings advantageously exhibit a tack temperature well above 700C whereby the dry powder does not cake or block, can be easily spray applied, and fused with moderate heat to provide a thermoset continuous surface coating. The powder paints in accordance with this invention can be applied to a steel panel substrate and moderately heated between temperatures of about 1400C and 2050C for 5 to 30 minutes to obtain desirable flow out and cure.The advantages of this invention are further illustrated in the Example 15.

This polyester diol was processed by usual condenstion polymerization techniques to an acid number of 4.0 mg. KOH per gram. It had a tack temperature of 540C, a hydroxyl content of 3.3 and a calculated molecular weight of 909. The batch was cooled to 1500C and then 1020 grams of TMMGU were added and melted in.30 Grams Quadrol and 30 grams Polycat 200 were then added at 1200C.

It can be seen from the Table I results that excellent physical stability cannot be achieved using straight TMMGU as the cross linking agent Examples 3 to 8 . Even at the lowest ratio of TMMGU to resin of 5 95 to 7 93 Examples 3 to 5 the physical stability is not as good as with the prepolymer condensates of the present invention Examples 9 12 . At the 5 95 ratio of TMMGU to resin, cure and physical properties of the coating are already deficient so that it is not practical to reduce the level of TMMGU any farther to improve physical stability. Although the melting point of TMMGU 1170C is actually higher than the tack temperatures of the prepolymer condensates fo the present invention 75 850C , TMMGU is monomeric and miscible with the resin and thus, has a strong Tg depressant effect in the finished powder blend.The data in Figure 1 provides further strong experimental evidence for undesirable Tg depressant effect of monomeric methoxy methyl type cross linking agents in blend with a typical polyester VPE5802 powder resin, compared to a typical prepolymer condensate of the present invention prepolymer A The prepolymers of the present invention are a much greater improvement,exhibit a minimum eutectic effect of mixed solids, and provides a substantial improvement in anti caking effect when compared to TMMGU and hexamethoxymethyl melamine HMMM . Thus, it is apparent that the conflict between physical stability caking and coating performance with the use of TMMGU as a powder cross linker has been resolved by the use of the prepolymer condensates of the present invention replacing the simple TMMGU. Increased levels of the prepolymer condensates up to stoichiometric proportions in Examples 9 11 provide even better properties and still have good package stability.
