# Catalytic amination process for the production of amines.

## Abstract
Vapor phase catalytic production of an amine by the reac tion of a mixture comprising an olefin having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms and ammonia or ammonia type compound. The formation of polymers is prevented by applying a temperature ranging from 200 to 500 C, a pressure of from 300 to 6,000 psig and an ALUMlNO SlLlCATE, e.g. a zeolite catalyst.
