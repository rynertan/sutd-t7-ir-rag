# Method of and apparatus for restoring the light transmittance of an image transmitting optical fiber bundle used in a fiberoptic endoscope.

## Abstract
Exposure of a fiberoptic endoscope X ray or Î³ ray irradiation causes discoloration of fiber bundle with a reduction in light transmittance and makes observation or examination difficult. According to the invention the irradia tion induced reduction in light transmittance of the image transmitting fiber bundle 52 is eliminated by visible light radiation thereto through its end using a light source 64 attachable to the exit end of the endoscope. Visible light radiation having short wavelength causes the transmittance to recover to that before irradiation in a short period of time.
