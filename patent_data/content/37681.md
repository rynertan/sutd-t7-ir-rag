# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING YARNS

## Abstract
A plurality of yarns 10 are scanned by a beam of radiation from an emitter 13. The emitter 13, together with a detector 14, is mounted on a carriage 11 which moves along a track 12. The detector 14 detects the effect that each yarn has on the radia tion and this can be used to dedect if any of the yarns have significantly different properties from other yarns.
