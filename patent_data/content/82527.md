# Process for partial hot dipping of steel strips.

## Abstract
A process for the partial hot dipping of a long steel strip is disclosed which comprises forming an oxidation inhibiting film, oxygen impermeable and thermally stable in a hot dipping bath, which film is produced by the chemical reaction of an iron content in the steel strip with an oxidation inhibiting film forming agent, such as an inorganic phosphoric acid compound, on a predetermined area of the steel strip surface, forming, as required, an intermediate layer comprising an inorganic binder, such as water glass, on the resulting film, forming a carbon containing, plateing stopping film as a top coast on the intermediate layer, and hot dipping the steel strip.
