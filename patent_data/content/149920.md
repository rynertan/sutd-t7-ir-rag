## Description
This invention relates to a controlled absorption pharmaceutical formulation and, in particular, to a controlled absorption form of diltiazem for oral administration. EP A 077956 describes microcapsules containing an active compound such as diltiazem as a core material, the coating walls of the capsules consisting essentially of ethylcellulose and an enteric polymer material. These microcapsules control the release of diltiazem to the extent that they prevent release of it in the stomach but easily and quickly release it in the intestinal tract. Diltiazem Conventional diltiazem therapy starts with 30 mg administered 4 times daily. The dosage is gradually increased to 240 mg, given in divided doses three or four times daily, at one to two day intervals until an optimum response is obtained. Diltiazem is extensively metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and in bile. According to professional use information issued by Marion Laboratories Inc., diltiazem is absorbed from the known tablet formulation Cardiazem to about 80 and is subject to an extensive first pass effect, giving an absolute bioavailability, compared to intravenous administration, of about 40 . Single oral doses of 30 to 120 mg of diltiazem result in peak plasma levels 2 3 hours after administration. Detectable plasma levels occur within 30 60 minutes after administration indicating that diltiazem is readily absorbed. The plasma elimination half life following single or multiple administration is approximately 3 5 hours. Therapeutic blood levels of diltiazem are thought to be in the range of 50 200 ng ml. An article by McAuley, Bruce. J. and Schroeder, John S. in Pharmacotherapy 2 121, 1982, states that peak plasma levels of diltiazem occur within 1 hour with normal capsules and within 3 to 4 hours with sustained release tablets. It is an object of the present invention to provide a controlled absorption diltiazem formulation suitable for twice daily administration and which has improved bioavailability relative to known diltiazem oral formulations. Accordingly, the invention provides a controlled absorption diltiazem formulation for oral administration, comprising a pellet having a core of diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof such that the formulation contains a therapeutically effective amount of diltiazem in association with a water soluble organic acid and a lubricant, and a multi layer membrane surrounding said core and containing a major proportion of a pharmaceutically acceptable film forming, water insoluble polymer and a minor proportion of a pharmaceutically acceptable film forming, water soluble polymer, the number of layers in said membrane and the ratio of said water soluble polymer to water insoluble polymer being effective to permit release of said diltiazem from said pellet at a rate allowing controlled absorption thereof over a twelve hour period following oral administration, said rate being measured Preferably, the organic acid is represented by one or more of the following acids fumaric acid, malic acid and succinic acid. The diltiazem and organic acid are preferably present in a ratio of from 19 1 to 1 1. Preferably, the lubricant is represented by one or more of the following sodium stearate, magnesium stearate or talc. The diltiazem and lubricant are preferably present in a ratio of from 5 1 to 100 1. Preferably, the core comprises diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the associated organic acid and lubricant embedded in a polymeric material in a multi layer arrangement. The polymeric material in which the diltiazem is embedded may be rapidly soluble in water or, alternatively, be readily permeable or porous to diltiazem and water. The polymeric material suitably contains a major proportion of water soluble polymer and a minor proportion of a water insoluble polymer. The ratio of water soluble to water insoluble polymer is determined by the particular combination of polymers selected. The ratio of water soluble polymer to water insoluble polymer will normally be in the range of 1.0 1 to 19 1. The water soluble polymer is suitably polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or a polymer sold under the Trade Mark Eudragit RL or a mixture thereof. The water insoluble polymer is suitably polyvinyl choride, Shellac, polyurethane, ethylcellulose or a polymer sold under the Trade Mark Eudragit RS or a mixture thereof. The core suitably has between 50 and 200 layers and is built up in a manner known Further, preferably, the multi layer arrangement of diltiazem, organic acid, lubricant and polymeric material is built up on a central inert core suitably consisting of a non pareil seed of starch sugar having an average diameter in the range 0.5 0.8 mm, especially 0.6 0.71 mm, in a conventional coating pan. The diltiazem, organic acid, lubricant and optionally other components are blended to form a homogenous powder. Alternate layers of a coating solution of the polymeric material and the powder are applied to the central inert core so as to build up the multi layer arrangement of the active core. The concentration of the polymeric material in the coating solution is determined by the viscosity of the final solution. Preferably, between 25 and 75 parts of inert core are used relative to the homogenous powder. The outer membrane preferably has a major proportion of a water insoluble polymer and a minor proportion of a water soluble polymer, the ratio of water insoluble to water soluble polymer being determined by the inherent solubility characteristics of the polymers selected. Preferably the ratio of water soluble polymer to water insoluble polymer is from 1 1 to 1 19. Suitable examples of water insoluble polymers are those specified for the polymeric material referred to above or a mixture thereof. Examples of suitable water soluble polymers are also those specified for the polymeric material referred to above or a mixture thereof. The outer membrane may also be composed of a major proportion of a non porous polymer and a minor proportion of a porous polymer, the ratio of non porous to porous polymer being determined by the inherent porosity of the respective polymers. The outer membrane is built up by applying a plurality of coats of a membrane polymer solution to the active core as hereinafter described to a thickness sufficient to obtain the desired dissolution rate of the finished pellet. The membrane solution contains the polymers dissolved in a suitable solvent, optionally in the presence of other additives such as a lubricant and or a plasticizer. Suitable lubricants are talc, magnesium stearate and sodium stearate. A suitable plasticizer is diethylphthalate. Preferably, the number of coats of membrane solution applied is between 20 and 40. The dissolution rate achieved is proportionally slower as the number of membrane coats increases. Further, preferably, 2 25 ml of membrane solution is applied per kilogram of active cores. The pellets may be filled into hard gelatin capsules. The invention will be further illustrated by the following examples. Diltiazem hydrochloride 1.0 kg , fumaric acid 0.25 kg and talc 0.100 kg were blended and milled through a No. 100 mesh screen so as to obtain a homogenous powder. The powder was applied to starch sugar seeds 0.6 0.71 mm diameter 0.5 kg in a standard coating pan using a coating solution of The seeds were coated with a measured volume of coating solution followed by dusting on of a measured weight of the powder mix. The coated seeds were allowed to dry and the coating step repeated until all of the powder had been applied. The coated seeds were then dried at 45 C overnight to remove all traces of solvent. The coated seeds defining the active core of the pellets being prepared were then surrounded by an outer membrane by applying 35 coats of a solution consisting of Each coat of membrane solution comprised 5 ml of solution per kg of coated seeds. After each coat had been applied the pellets were air dried in the coating pan. The finished pellets were then subjected to a dissolution test. Prior to performing the dissolution test the pellets were dried at 45 C to evaporate all of the solvent. The dissolution rate of the pellets was tested by the method of U.S. Pharmacopoeia XX Paddle Method in buffered media at pH 1.5, pH 4.0 and pH 7.0. The dissolution rate, which was found to be substantially pH independent, was as follows Example 1 was repeated except that the coating solution used was The membrane solution used was The dissolution rate of the pellets, which was measured according to the procedure followed in Example 1, was found to be Pellets according to Example 1 were filled directly into hard gelatin capsules without the addition of any extra ingredients so as to obtain capsules containing 60 mg of of diltiazem hydrochloride. Pellets according to Example 2 were filled directly into hard gelatin capsules without the addition of any extra ingredients so as to obtain capsules containing 120 mg diltiazem hydrochloride. Fig. 1 is a graph of plasma levels ng ml versus time after administration hours for a single dose 60 mg of diltiazem in capsule form according to Example 3 compared with a single dose 60 mg of diltiazem in a loose filled capsule . The graphs of Fig. 1 were drawn from the mean values obtained for six subjects according to the data listed in Table 1 on day 5 of administration. Fig. 2 is a graph of plasma levels ng ml versus time after administration hours for a single dose 120 mg of diltiazem in capsule form according to Example 4 compared with a single dose 60 mg of diltiazem in a loose filled capsule . The graphs of Fig. 2 were drawn from the mean values obtained for eight subjects according to the data listed in Table 2. Both the single dose Fig.2 Table 2 and steady state Fig.1 Table 1 bioavailability data illustrate the suitability of the diltiazem formulation according to the invention as a twice per day form of diltiazem. As will be observed from Table 3 below, the products of Examples 3 and 4 are bioequivalent to the reference loose filled capsule i.e. there is no loss in AUC . The diltiazem formulation according to the invention, as exemplified by the products of Examples 3 and 4, shows a prolonged plasma profile with a delayed peaking time, lower peak plasma levels and a lower peak to trough plasma fluctuation both on single dose and steady state. The bioavailability studies indicate that the diltiazem formulation according to the invention is an effective twice daily form of diltiazem.
