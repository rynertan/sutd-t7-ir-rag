## Description
ANIONIC TEXTILE TREATING COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to copolyesters, to compositions for treating textile materials, to a method of improving the properties of textile materials, and to textile materials having improved properties. More particularly, this invention relates to aqueous dispersions which are suitable for imparting improved durable soil release properties to textile materials containing polyesters. Textile materials containing substantial quantities of polyester fibers have been favored over all cotton garments because the polyester fibers give improved abrasion resistance and crease resistance to the garments. However, garments containing a substantial quantity of polyester fibers have exhibited a pronounced tendency to retain soil and stains, particularly oily stains. Furthermore, these garments have been found to resist release of the soil or stains even upon exposure to repeated laundering. In all liklihood the propensity of polyester fibers to accumulate stains is due to the inherently oleophilic structure of polyester fibers.In an attempt to overcome these inherent difficulties with garments made with polyester fibers, the industry has resorted to the use of a variety of textile treating compositions which provide a degree of soil resistance, wicking, resistance to soil redeposition and durability to repeated home laundering in aqueous systems. There remains a need in the industry, however, for a textile treating composition which provides all of the aforementioned properties and advantages and, in addition, provides better resistance to soil redeposition during dry cleaning and higher fiber to fiber friction. It has now been discovered that this need may be met by a polymer having a molecular weight from 2,000 to 10,000 and comprising a copolyester of ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of from 200 to 1000, aromatic dicarboxylic acid containing only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms and alkali metal salt of a sulfonated aromatic dicarboxylic acid containing only carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur atoms. Textile materials containing polyester fibers which have been treated with one or more of these copolyesters exhibit excellent soil resistance, good wicking, improved cohesion, high fiber to fiber friction, and low yarn to metal friction, and excellent durability and resistance to soil redeposition during dry cleaning and home laundering. Unless indicated otherwise, molecular weights of the polymers of this invention are calculated by end group analysis according to the following formula Molecular weight 112,200 Acid No. Hydroxyl No. It is essential that the polyethylene glycol used to prepare the polymers of this invention have an average molecular weight from 200 to 1000 and preferably from 200 to 600. Polymers which do not contain groups derived from polyethylene glycol within the molecular weight range are unsuitable for imparting excellent properties to polyester textile materials treated therewith. The polyethylene glycol may be replaced in part with monoalkylethers of polyethylene glycols, particularly the lower monoalkylethers such as methyl, ethyl, and butyl.Polypropylene glycols and higher alkylene glycols are generally not desirable because they tend to adversely effect the properties of the textile materials treated with the copolyesters. However, polyglycols which are copolymers of ethylene glycol and higher alkylene glycols may be used provided the higher alkylene glycol is only a minor portion of the polyglycol. A preferred polyethylene glycol is polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of about 300. The preferred aromatic dicarboxylic acid containing only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms is terphthalic acid.Illustrative examples of other dicarboxylic acids which may be used include isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acids, anthracene dicarboxylic acids, biphenyl dicarboxylic acids, oxydibenzoic acids and the like. It is also within the scope of the present invention to include a minor portion of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid such as adipic, glutaric, succinic, trimethyladipic, pimelic, azelaic, sebacic, suberic, 1,4 cyclo hexane dicarboxylic acid, and dodecanedioic acids in the copolymer. The specific amount of aliphatic dicarboxylic present in the copolymer is not critical, but is usually not more than about ten mole percent of the total amount of aromatic dicarboxylic acid used. Illustrative examples of sulfonated aromatic dicarboxylic acids which may be used to prepare the copolymers of this invention include the alkali metal salts of 2 naphthyldicarboxy benzene sulfonate, l naphthyldicarboxy benzene sulfonate, phenyl dicarboxybenzene sulfonate, 2,6 dimethylphenyl 3,5 dicarboxybenzene sulfonate and phenyl 3,5dicarboxy benzene sulfonate. The preferred sulfonated salt is 5 sulfoisophthalic acid sodium salt. The relative amounts of 1 ethylene glycol, 2 polyethylene glycol, 3 dicarboxylic acid containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and 4 alkali metal salt of the sulfonated aromatic dicarboxylic acid used to prepare the copolymers of this invention may vary over a very wide range.It is preferred to use an excess of 1 and 2 over 3 and 4 so that the end groups of the resulting copolyester are largely, but not necessarily exclusively, hydroxyl groups.Taking the molar amount of the alkali metal salt of the sulfonated aromatic dicarboxylic acid as one, the relative molar amounts of the other reactants are as follows The molar amount of aromatic dicarboxylic acid 3 is from 1 to 8 and preferably from 3 to 5 and the amount of polyethylene glycol is from 0.1 to 2 and preferably from 0.2 to 1.0. The balance of the polymer is largely ethylene glycol and the amount of ethylene glycol in the product is such that the moles of polyol is larger than the moles of dicarboxylic acid and the copolyester is terminated mainly but not exclusively with hydroxyl groups.Sufficient ethylene glycol is used to give a copolyester having a molecular weight from 2,000 to 10,000. Any excess ethylene glycol is distill from the reaction mixture. The copolyesters of our invention may be prepared by techniques conventional in the art for the preparation of copolyesters of glycols and dicarboxylic acids. The preferred method for preparing the copolyester comprises reacting the desired mixture of lower alkyl esters methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl of the dicarboxylic acids with a mixture of ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol. The glycol esters and oligomers produced in this ester interchange reaction are then polymerized to the desired molecular weight.The ester interchange reaction may be conducted in accordance with reaction conditions generally used for ester interchange reactions. This ester interchange reaction is usually conducted at temperatures of 1200C to 2100C in the presence of an esterification catalyst. Alkanol is formed and constantly removed thus forcing the reaction to completion. The temperature of the reaction should be controlled so that ethylene glycol does not distill from the reaction mixture. Higher temperatures may be used if the reaction is conducted under pressure. The catalysts used for the ester interchange reaction are those well known to the art. They include alkali and alkaline earth metals e.g. Li, Na, Ca, Mg and Transition andGroup IIB metals e.g. Mn, Co, Zn and are usually added as the oxides, carbonates or acetates. The extent of the ester interchange reaction can be followed by the amount of methanol liberated or the disappearance of the dialkyl dibasic acids in the reaction mixture as determined by high performance liquid chromatography or any other suitable technique. The ester interchange reaction should be taken to more than 90 completion. Greater than 95 completion is preferred in order to decrease the amount of sublimates obtained in the polymerization step. Stabilizers such as phosphorous and phosphoric acid and esters thereof may be added at the end of the ester interchange step. The purpose of the stabilizer is to inhibit degradation, oxidation, and other side reactions destroy the catalytic activity of the ester interchange catalyst and prevent precipitation of insoluble metal carboxylates. When the ester interchange reaction is complete, the glycol ester products are then polymerized to produce copolymers with a molecular weight of at least 2,000. The polymerization reaction is usually conducted at temperatures from about 2200C to about 2900C in the presence of a catalyst.Higher temperatures may be used but tend to produce darker colored products. Illustrative examples of catalyst useful for the polymerization step include antimony trioxide, germanium dioxide, titanium alkoxide, hydrated antimony pentoxide, and ester interchange catalysts such as salts of zinc, cobalt and manganese. Excess ethylene glycol and other volatiles liberated during the reaction are removed under vacuum. The reaction is continued until the molecular weight of the polymer, as determined by end group anaylsis, is at least 2,000. Higher molecular weight copolymers, for example above 3,000, are particularly desirable because they are more easily dispersed in water. Polymerization is usually stopped just before the reaction mixture becomes too viscous to agitate and before removal from the reaction vessel becomes a problem. A practical upper limit for the molecular weight is about 10,000. The ester interchange reaction can be conducted in various ways to produce functional products. Illustrative examples of conducting the ester interchange reaction include 1 All of the components, dicarboxylic dialkyl esters, ethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol, can be charged at the start and ester interchanged together. This technique is illustrated in Example 1 2 The lower alkyl esters of the dicarboxylic acids can be charged to the mixture of ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol sequentially and ester interchanged in sequence. This technique is illustrated in Example 8.It is understood that all of the components of the copolyester must be present before the polymerization reaction occurs 3 The ester interchange of dimethyl terephthalate with glycol and the ester interchange of dimethyl sulfoisophthalate, sodium salt with glycol can be conducted in separate vessels and combined for the polymerization step.Aliphatic dicarboxylic acid can be introduced in either of these separate reactions. This method is illustrated inExample 11. The copolymers of this invention are particularly useful for treating textile materials containing polyester fibers, and are particularly useful with textile materials which are 100 polyester or polyester cotton blends. The particular form of the textile articles to be treated in accordance with the present invention is not important and includes filaments, fibers, fabrics and films. In order to treat textile materials with the copolymers of this invention it is essential to heat the copolymer in contact with the surface of the textile material.Where a dispersion or solution of the anionic textile treating composition is used, the continuous phase or solvent may be removed by the same or by a previous thermal treatment or it may be allowed to evaporate before thermal treatment.Preferably, the copolymers are applied to the textile materials from an aqueous dispersion. The textile treating composition may be applied directly from a continuous phase, for example by using techniques normally used for dyeing textile materials with dispersed dyestuffs. After the textile material is contacted with the copolyester it is heated to an elevated temperature to heat set. The temperature required to produce a durable treatment of the textile material is about 900C or above and preferably the temperature should not exceed 150at. Obviously the temperature should not be so high as to melt or damage the textile material being treated, so temperatures above the melting point of the textile materials can only be applied for very short times. It is useful, particularly when the active group or groups of the textile material or the textile treating composition are affected by atmospheric oxygen at the temperature of the thermal treatment, to carry out the thermal treatment in the presence of an antioxidant. The antioxidant may be present as a separate compound dissolved or dispersed in the treating composition. In general, the antioxidant used may be any antioxidant generally used in the art for stabilizing polyethers from thermal degradation. In considering those most suitable in the present invention it is necessary to satisfy the criteria that the antioxidant should be stable and effective at the temperature employed in the thermal treatment and that it should produce no undesirable color or odor. For example, Santonox R or Irganox 858, pyrogallol, or zinc diethyldithiocarbamate may be used.A combination of two or more antioxidants may give better results than either antioxidant alone. Thus, for example, a mixture of zinc dinonyldithiocarbamate with 2 alpha methylcyclohexyl 4, 6 dimethylphenol is more effective than either antioxidant used alone. The nature of the polyesters of this invention and methods for their preparation and use will be better understood from a consideration of the following examples which are presented for illustrative purposes.

As can be seen by the data presented in the followingTables, textile materials treated with copolymer of this invention have excellent physical properties. These data are obtained by the following procedure Anionic textile treating compositions are prepared by adding 14 parts of the indicated copolymer, 0.1 part of a bactericide, 0.16 part of antioxidant, and 0.24 part of polyoxyethylene 9 nonylphenol as emulsifier to 85.5 parts of water at room temperature. The water is heated to 1800F with stirring and held at that temperature until the copolymer is completely dispersed. The resulting dispersion applied to 100 poly ethylene terephthalate taffeta fabric at the rate of 0.14 parts by weight of copolyester per 100 parts by weight of fabric.The treated fabric is cooled to 100 1200F, rinsed in water at 12doF, dried, and then heated to 3500F for thirty seconds to heat set the finish. The soil release, soil redeposition, frictional and wicking properties of the treated polyester fabric are determined and shown in the following Tables II, III, IV and V. Soil Release The purpose of this test is to measure the ability of a fabric to release stains during home laundering. Oily stains like used motor oil, mineral oil, olive oil, corn oil, etc., are frequently employed, but many other stains such as ketchup, French dressing, mustard, chocolate syrup, grape juice, etc., may be used . Therefore the method can be used to check the performance of soil release finishes designed to facilitate the removal of soils during washing. Tests conducted before washing and again after multiple washes serve to show the durability of the finish to laundering. Swatches of fabric to be tested, i.e., those treated with soil release finishing agents and untreated controls, are stained with a drop of used motor oil or other desired stain and allowed to stand for at least five minutes so that the drop can spread out and penetrate into the fabric. Viscous or pasty stains are rubbed into the fabric with a spatula. The stained fabrics are then washed in an automatic washing machine under controlled conditions using 1 gram per liter of Tide detergent, a 1200F wash temperature, a small load setting and a cold water rinse. The fabrics are then dried on the high setting in an automatic dryer. A 1 x 1 square section containing the stained portion of fabric is cut out and mounted. This is the 1 wash sample . The staining, washing and drying procedure is repeated on the remaining portion of fabric to get a 2 wash sample. The bulk of the fabric is washed two more times, dried, then stained and washed again to prepare a 5 wash sample. In the same way 10 or more washes may be carried out if desired. The samples 1 wash, 2 wash, 5 wash, etc. are then rated according to how well the stain has been removed by a single laundering 5 Very Good total stain release 4 Good Significant but not total stain release 3 Moderate Moderate stain release 2 Poor Partial stain release 1 Failure No stain release The performance of a soil release finish is judged by comparing its rating to that of a control unfinished fabric. The multiple wash samples show the degree of durability of the soil release finish to laundering.

Soil Redeposition When soiled fabrics are laundered, the degree of cleanliness achieved depends upon the ability of the detergent solution used to a remove soils from the fibers and b keep those soils suspended in the solution so that they will not redeposit on the fabric. The purpose of this test is to measure the degree of soil redeposition that occurs on a fabric during the laundering process. It can be used to test the effectiveness of fabric finishes in preventing soil redeposition. The test is carried out by placing a 3 x 3 swatch of the unsoiled fabric to be tested in a 300 ml. Launder Ometer can, adding 100 ml. of a 1 gram per liter solution of Tide detergent, four 3 x 3 swatches of an artificially soiled flannelette fabric, and ten 1 4 diameter stainless steel balls for agitation. The flannelette fabric contains a standard soil consisting of carbon black, a fatty glyceride, and mineral oil. The can is then capped and mounted in the Launder Ometer. When the machine is turned on the contents of the can are agitated and tumbled while being heated to 1760F and during the 45 minutes run at that temperature. During the operation soils are removed from the flannelette fabric due to the action of the detergent, and a certain amount of these soils are redeposited on the clean test fabric. After laundering, the samples are rinsed, dried, pressed, and assessed for degree of soil redeposition according to the following rate VG Very Good No soil pick up G Good Slight soil pick up M Moderate Moderate soil pick up F Fair Significant soil pick up P Poor Excessive soil pick up When soil release finishes are being evaluated, an unfinished control is included in the test for comparison. Performance is usually checked on samples of the finished fabric that have not been washed, and on samples that have been washed two and five times by a standard procedure in an automatic washer. The performance of the washed samples gives an indication of the durability of the finish to repeated home launderings.

Yarn Friction The Atlab Yarn Friction Tester is used to measure frictional properties of yarns under controlled conditions. The numerical values obtained make it possible to characterize a given yarn and, to a degree, predict how that yarn will perform during certain stages of processing and after it has been woven or knitted into a fabric. The tester can be used to evaluate the performance of finishes lubricants, cohesive agents, etc. simply be applying those finishes and measuring their effects on the frictional behavior of the yarn. Yarns to be tested are prepared, wound on cones, and conditioned for at least 16 hours in a controlled atmosphere usually 65 relative humidity and 750F in the laboratory where the measurements are to be made. The test is conducted by feeding the yarn into the machine, applying a certain, predetermined tension T1 , and causing it to run at a selected, constant speed over a friction producing surface. For yarn to metal measurements the surface is in the form of two or three stainless steel pins.For yarn to yarn measurements a friction producing surface is made by twisting a loop of yarn so that the moving yarn rubs against itself. After passing over the metal or yarn surface, the tension in the yarn increases from the initial value T1 to a new, higher value T2 . The increase in tension T2 T1, orTf is directly related to the amount of friction developed at that surface. A finish applied to the yarn may increase or decrease friction compared to an unfinished control yarn, and it often will improve friction uniformity to minimize tension variations in the yarn. During the test, the increase in tension,Tf, is automatically recorded on a chart. Yarn to metal tests are usually run at high speeds, e.g., 10, 50, and 100 meters per minute. Average Tf values, in grams, are read from the curves traced on the chart. Yarn to yarn tests are run at much slower speeds. For example, the yarn may be moving at only one centimeter per minute. The curves produced may be smooth or they may have a stick slip or saw tooth pattern. Average Tf values are read from the charts and reported in grams. In addition, a value is used to show the degree of stick slip variation above and below the average value. For a smooth curve the value would be zero . A high stick slip value indicates a greater degree of cohesion between yarns, filaments and fibers. In general a low yarn to metal friction value is desirable. Lubricants are routinely employed to reduce friction between the yarn and guides or other metallic parts of the processing equipment. Effective lubricants permit high production speeds without damage to the yarn. A low yarn to yarn friction with no stick slip effect evident in the curve indicates that yarns,, filaments or fibers will slide easily over one another. This can be desirable in a fabric since it will result in a low flex stiffness resistance to bending and produce a soft feel or hand. Frequently, however, a higher yarn to yarn friction with some cohesion is important. In the processing of filament yarns, for example, some cohesion is needed to maintain the integrity of the yarn bundle and prevent snagging of individual filaments. Cohesion is also required to prevent slippage and permit yarns to be wound into firm, stable packages such as cones and pirns. In certain fabrics, especially delicate ones, too little cohesion can result in slippage of one yarn over another and result in serious defects.

Wicking The purpose of this test is to determine the vertical wicking rate of fabrics, which is a measure of their moisture transfer characteristics. It can be used to evaluate fabric finishes designed to impart hydrophilic properties to fabrics. Strips of the fabrics to be tested 1 x 8 , all cut in the same direction of the fabric, are used in the test. If hydrophilic finishes are being tested, an unfinished control fabric should be included for comparison. Unwashed fabric and fabrics that have been laundered one or more times can be included to check the durability of the finishes to washing. All fabrics to be tested are allowed to remain at ambient atmospheric conditions for at least 16 hours before testing. The test is carried out by raising a beaker of water until the surface of the water just meets the bottom edge of the vertically suspended fabric strip, and measuring the wicking rate by recording the height of liquid rise on the fabric at intervals of one, five, and ten minutes. A suitable dye, added to the water, produces a colored solution that makes it easier to observe the exact position of the advancing liquid front. Wicking heights at a given time are compared. The greater the wicking height the better the moisture transfer characteristics of the fabric. Good moisture transfer contributes to the comfort of apparel items, particularly for garments worn against the skin. Table V Wicking In CM.
