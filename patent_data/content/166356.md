## Description
The present invention is directed to novel 2 substituted aminomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepines which have been found to be antagonists of the function of cholecystokinins CCK , to the preparation of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds as active ingredient for antagonizing the function of CCK, which antagonism is useful, e.g., for the treatment and prevention of disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of mammals, especially of humans. Cholecystokinins CCK are neuropeptides see Mutt and Jorpes, In addition, CCK s stimulate colonic motility, gall bladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion, and inhibit gastric emptying. CCK s reportedly also co exist with dopamine in certain mid brain neurons, and thus may additionally play a role in the functioning of dopaminergic systems in the brain, as well as serve as neurotransmitters in their own right. See A. J. Prange Antagonists of CCK are useful for preventing or treating CCK related disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of mammals, specially of humans. Three distinct chemical classes of CCK receptor antagonists have been reported. The first class comprises derivatives of cyclic nucleotides, of which dibutyryl cyclic GMP has been shown to be the most potent by detailed structure funcion studies see N. Barlos The second class comprises peptide antagonists which are C terminal fragments and analogs of CCK, of which both shorter Boc Met Asp Phe NH₂, Met Asp Phe NH₂ and longer Cbz Tyr SO₃H Met Gly Trp Met Asp NH₂ C terminal fragments of CCK can function as CCK antagonists, according to recent structure function studies see R.T. Jensen The third class of CCK receptor antagonists comprises the amino acid derivatives proglumide, a derivative of glutamaric acid, and the N acyl tryptophans, including para chlorobenzoyl All of these compounds, however, are relatively weak antagonists of CCK IC₅₀ generally 10 ⁴M, but down to 10 ⁶M in the case of the peptides . The peptide CCK antagonista have furthermore substantial stability and absorption problems. In the publication of J. Bradwein and in the corresponding benzodiazepine which is named lorazepam the radical R is hydrogen and in the corresponding compound named flurazepam the radical R is a group of formula In both said compounds the benzene nucleus which is bonded to the carbon atom in the position 5 is substituted in its ortho position with a chlorine atom. The third tested compound which is named diazepam differs from the compounds of formula A in that to the carbon atom in the position 3 of the seven membered ring there are bonded two hydrogen atoms and no hydroxy group and in said compound the radical R is methyl and the benzene nucleus bonded to the carbon atom in the position 5 is unsubstituted. In said benzodiazepine derivatives accordingly the carbon atom in the position 2 is a carbonyl group and the carbon atom in the position 3 is a group of formula H C OH or CH₂ . The benzodiazepine BZD structure class has been widely exploited as therapeutic agents, specially as central nervous system CNS drugs. These compounds exhibit strong binding to benzodiazepine receptors In the German Offenlegungsschrift 2 353 187 there are described benzodiasepine derivatives in which to the carbon atom in the position 2 of the seven membered ring there is bonded an amino substituted methyl group, the carbon atom in the position 3 is a CH₂ group and to the carbon atom in the position 5 there is bonded an optionally substituted phenyl nucleus. Said benzodiazepines accordingly correspond to the following formula B in which is either an NH₂ group which is acylated with an aliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid forming a cyclic structure or in said group wherein Y is as defined above and the phenyl nuclei A and B can be optionally substituted with substituents selected from the group comprising nitro, halo, trifluoro, methyl, loweralkyl, loweralkoxy methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy respectively see claim 1 . There is stated on page 2, second paragraph, of said publication that the corresponding substances can be used for influencing the central nervous system and they specially have an anticonvulsant, sedatic, a tranquilizing and a musclerelaxant activity. In the U.S. patent 4 307 237 there are described compounds which have a benzodiazepine structure, provided that the ring corresponding to the ring A of the benzodiazepines of formula B is an optionally substituted benzene nucleus and not one of the five membered heterocycles which are as well disclosed in said patent. The substituent bonded to the carbon atom in the position 5 of the benzodiazepine structure is an optionally substituted phenyl or pyridyl nucleus. The compounds described in the abstract and in column 1 of said patent as well as the preferred compounds of formulae Ia, Ib, Ic and Id disclosed in columns 3, 5 and 6 of said patent, however, differ from the benzodiazepines having the above stated formula B in that the substituent X and the substituents Y and Z form together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded a five membered heterocyclic ring, i.e. an imidazo structure which is condensed with the seven membered ring of the benzodiazepine. Said compounds having totally three condensed rings are stated to have the pharmaceutical activity of anticonvulsants, musclerelaxants, anxiolytic and sedative agents and also corresponding compounds which result from a cleaving of the seven membered ring between the carbon atom in the position 5 and the nitrogen atom in the position 4 are stated to have a pharmacological activity see column 7 . Structurally related to the benzodiazepine compounds of the above stated formula B, however, are those starting materials having the formulae V and VI disclosed in columns 9 and 10 of said U.S. patent in which to the carbon atom in the position 2 of the seven membered ring there is bonded a methyl group which is substituted with an amino group NH₂ or a corresponding amino group which is acylated with an aliphatic carboxylic acid or a carboxylic acid in which the group COOH is bonded to an optionally substituted phenyl or pyridyl nucleus. The substituent corresponding to the group X of the benzodiazepines having the formula B stated above can be in said starting materials either a hydrogen atom or an acyl group derived from one of the above named carboxylic acids. There however is nowhere stated in said U.S. patent that the starting materials disclosed therein have any pharmaceutical activity. In the French patent publication 2 248 278 there are described benzodiazepines which can be as well illustrated with the above stated formula B, provided that the methyl group, bonded to the carbon atom in the seven membered ring is substituted with such a radical R₂ which has the meaning of an amino group or an acylated amino group. In said compound the group corresponding to the group of the compounds of formula B can be a corresponding group in which the radicals Y and Z are hydrogen, alkyl, aralkyl or aryloxy alkyl or they can form together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded a heterocyclic structure see page 1, lines 21 34 of said publication . The corresponding compounds are stated to have an anticonvulsant, tranquilizing, sedatic and musclerelaxant activity see page 2, lines 10 16 . Also in the German patent specification 2 221 558 there are described benzodiazepine derivatives which can be illustrated with the above stated formula B provided that the methyl group which is bonded to the carbon atom in the position 2 of the benzodiazepine nucleus is substituted with a radical R₄ which has the meaning of an amino group. In the compounds disclosed in said patent the radical which corresponds to the group X of the compounds of formula B has to be a hydrogen atom or a methyl group and the benzene nuclei A and B are unsubstituted or substituted with substituents selected from the group comprising halo atoms, nitro groups and trifluoro methyl groups. The corresponding compounds have an influence onto the central nervous system and they have an anticonvulsant, sedatic, tranquilizing and musclerelaxant activity see column 4, lines 1 5 . In the European patent publication 0 054 839 there are disclosed benzodiazepine derivatives which can be illustrated with the above stated formula B. In said compounds the radical corresponding to the group X is hydrogen, loweralkyl, loweralkenyl or cyclopropylmethyl and the amino group bonded to the methyl group in the position 2 is an acylated amino group in which the radical corresponding to the group Y of the compounds of formula B is hydrogen, loweralkyl or loweralkenyl and the group corresponding to the group Z is a group of formula wherein R is an optionally substituted phenyl nucleus which is directly bonded or bonded via a methylene or ethylene group. Said compounds are stated to have a strong analgetic activity and besides said activity also a sedatic activity, a diuretic activity and an antiarrhythmic activity see page 1, last paragraph . In the European patent publication 0 031 080 there are as well described benzodiazepine derivatives which can be illustrated with the above stated formula B. The substituent corresponding to the group X is hydrogen, a loweralkyl or alkenyl group or a cyclopropyl methyl group. Furthermore the radical corresponding to the substituent Y is a loweralkyl or alkenyl group and the radical corresponding to the group wherein the radical R is a five membered or six membered heterocycle which is selected from the group comprising a furan nucleus, a thiophene nucleus, a pyrrol nucleus, an N loweralkyl pyrrol nucleus or a pyridine nucleus and wherein said pyrrol or N alkyl pyrrol nucleus can be substituted with alkyl having 1 4 carbon atoms and furan nuclei and thiophene nuclei can be further substituted with chloro, bromo, lower alkyl, loweralkoxy or nitro. There is stated on page 2, first paragraph of said patent that the corresponding benzodiazepine compounds have in addition to their activity as psychopharmacon and their diuretic and antiarrythmic activity also a strong analgetic activity and only low toxic properties. In the U.S. patent 4 325 957 there are as well disclosed certain 2 acylaminomethyl 1H 2,3 dihydro 1,4 benzodiazepine derivatives. However, those derivatives were suggested as simply possessing strong analgesic activities, in addition to psychopharmacological, diuretic and antiarrythmic properties. Additonally, the compound corresponding to formula B stated before wherein the benzene nucleus A is unsubstituted, the benzene nucleus B is substituted in its position 3 with a fluoro atom, wherein R is a thiophene nucleus bonded to the position 3 has been reported to be an opiate agonist with selectivity for the kappa receptor see D. Roemer Accordingly none of the benzodiazepine derivatives disclosed in the prior art have been previously reported to antagonize the function of cholecystokinins, specially the excessive function of cholecystokinins in disease state. It was an aim of the present invention to develop new benzodiazepine derivatives which are able to antagonize cholecystokinins in the brain as well as also in the gut. One object of the present invention are 2 substituted aminomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepines which have the formulae I, II or V in which formulae Preferred inventive compounds of formulae I or II are those in which Particularly preferred compounds of formula I are the following substances 1 methyl 2 2 indolecarbonyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 4 thianaphthenemethylcarbonyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 1 2 L hydroxy 2 phenylacetyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 1H indol 3 yl methylcarbonylaminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 1 S 1 methoxycarbonyl 2 phenylethylamino methyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 2 1,1 dimethylethoxy carbonyl amino 3 1H indol 3 yl propanoyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 2 amino 3 1H indol 3 yl propanoyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 2 methoxy 2 trifluoromethyl 2 phenylacetyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 2 S 1,1 dimethylethoxy carbonyl amino 3 acetamidomethylmercaptopropanoyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 benzylsuccinoyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, and 1 methyl 2 acetamidomethylmercaptoacetyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine. Particularly preferred compounds of formula II include 1 methyl 2 2 indolecarbonyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophettyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 4 thianaphthenemethylcarbonyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 2 L hydroxy 2 phenylacetyl aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, 1 methyl 2 1H indol 3 yl methylcarbonylaminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine, The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the instant invention include the conventional non toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of this invention formed, for example, from non toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric or nitric acid and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2 acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, theophylline, 8 chlorotheophylline, p aminobenzoic, p acetamidobenzoic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, or isethionic acid. A further object of the present invention is a process for preparing 2 substituted aminomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepines having the formula I wherein X, Y, q, r, R, R¹ and R² are as defined in connection with the compounds of formulae I and II. Said process is characterized in that a compound of formula III or an acid addition salt of the compound of formula III, in which formula III X, Y, q, r and R are as defined in formula I, is acylated with a carboxylic acid having the formula R⁵ COOH, wherein which compounds of formula Ia are optionally alkylated by substituting the hydrogen atom bonded to the nitrogen atom of the acid amide group by an alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group having 3 5 carbon atoms or in that the amino compound of formula III stated before is alkylated with a compound of formula wherein X² is chloro, bromo or iodo or the group wherein R³ and R⁴ are as defined before in connection with formula I. According to a further embodiment the compounds of formula I are prepared by reacting a compound of formula IV wherein X, Y, q, r and R are as defined in formula I, with an amine of formula wherein R¹ and R² are as defined in formula I, at temperatures of from 0 C to the boiling point of the amine in the presence of an acid binding agent, or from 0 C to the boiling point of the solvent in the presence of an inert, aprotic solvent, yielding a compound of formula I. After said processes the corresponding compounds of formulae Ia, Ib or I or acid addition salts thereof are isolated or optionally the compounds of formulae Ia or Ib or I are converted to the quaternary ammonium salts. The process for the preparation of the compounds of formula I will be further illustrated by the following methods I and II which will be abbreviated in the following reaction scheme with MI and MII wherein X¹ OH, C1, or and X² C1, Br, I, OSO₂C₁ C₄ alkyl, OSO₂ phenyl or OSO₂ substituted phenyl. According to method MI, 2 substituted aminomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepine derivatives of formula I may be prepared by acylating an amino compound of formula III, or an acid addition salt thereof, with a carboxylic acid or a reactive carboxylic acid derivative. The preparation of 2 aminomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepine derivatives of formula III which are used as starting materials in the present invention nay be carried out in a known manner according to processes described in U.S. Patent 4,325,957 and German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,221,558. The acylaton is carried out in an aprotic solvent at temperatures between 30 C and the boiling point of the solvent under normal atmospheric pressure. If a carboxylic acid halogenide or a carboxylic acid anhydride is used as the acylating agent, the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of an acid binding agent, such as a tertiary amine, for example, triethylamine, pyridine or 4 dimethylaminopyridine The compounds of formula I may also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula III with a carbonic acid, R⁵ CO₂H, in an inert solvent at temperatures of from 30 C to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at room temperature, in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride or carbonyldiimidazole. Compounds of formula I, wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, may subsequently be converted into the corresponding N alkyl compounds by alkylation in the conventional manner. For example, such alkylations may be effected by reacting compounds of formula I, wherein R¹ is hydrogen, with a metallating agent, such as sodium or potassium hydride, or alkyl lithium reagent, in an inert solvent at temperatures of 78 C to the boiling point of the solvent. The metallated compound is then subsequently reacted with an alkyl halogenide, alkylsulfate or alkylsulfonic ester. According to method MII, the compounds of formula I may alternatively be prepared by reacting a 2 halomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepine derivative of formula IV prepared according to procedures in A further object of the present invention is a process for preparing compounds of formula II wherein X, Y, q, r, R, R¹ and R² are as defined before. According to said process a compound of formula I is dissolved in a suitable solvent, the solution is cooled to a temperature in the range of 30 C to 15 C and the mixture treated with a reducing agent and stirred until the reduction reaction is completed and the resulting mixture poured into water and the compound of formula II extracted and washed. Thereafter the free amino compound of formula II or a salt thereof is isolated or the free amino compound of formula II is optionally converted into a quaternary ammonium salt. The reaction accordingly is illustrated with the following method III which is abbreviated as MIII According to method MIII, 2 substituted aminomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepine derivatives of formula II are prepared by dissolving a compound of formula V prepared analogously to the preparation of compounds of formula III in a suitable solvent, such as glacial acetic acid, methanol or ethanol, and cooling the solution is to 30 to 15 C and treating it with a suitable reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium borohydride, or lithium borohydride. The reaction mixture is stirred until completion of the reaction approximately 5 minutes to 5 hours and poured into water. The resulting reaction mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate, chloroform or methylene chloride, and the combined organic extracts are washed with sodium bicarbonate solution and brine. Concentration affords the crude product which may be further purified by chromatography or recrystallization. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention may be synthesized from the compounds according to the instant invention which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts are prepared by reacting the free base or free acid with stoichiometric amounts of or with an excess of the desired salt forming inorganic or organic acid or base in a suitable solvent or in various combinations of solvents. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the acids according to this invention are also readily prepared by conventional procedures such as treating an acid of this invention with an appropriate amount of a base, such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, e.g., sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, or magnesium, or an organic base such as an amine, e.g., dibenzylethylenediamine, triethylamine, piperidine, pyrrolidine or benzylamine. In addition to the racemic forms of the compounds of formulae I and II produced according to the foregoing preparation methods, the present invention also includes the optically active forms of these compounds which may be obtained from the racemic mixtures in a conventional manner by formation of the salts using suitable optically active acids, such as tartaric acid, O,O dibenzoyl tartaric acid, mandelic acid or di O isopropylidene 2 oxo L gulonic acid, and fractionated crystallization of the optically active antipodes of the resulting salts see, S. W. Willen A further object of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition which is an antagonist of the function of cholecystokinins in mammals and it is characterized in that it comprises as active ingredient a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more 2 substituted aminomethyl 1,4 benzodiazepine derivatives of formulae I or II, optical isomers of such derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or quaternary ammonium salts of said compounds and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably the corresponding pharmaceutical compositions further comprise an adjuvant. The preferred active ingredients of said pharmaceutical compositions are the preferred compounds of formulae I and II defined before. The inventive pharmaceutical compositions can be used to antagonize the function of cholecystokinins in the brain and in the gut. Therefore said compositions can be used for preventing or treating corresponding disorders of the gastrointestinal, central nervous and appetite regulatory systems of mammals, specially humans. The screening of the inventive compounds of formulae I and II to determine their biological activity and obtain an IC₅₀ value for them, in order to identify significant CCK antagonism, may be accomplished using an ¹²⁵ I CCK receptor binding assay and CCK 33 was radiolabeled with ¹²⁵I Bolton Hunter reagent 2000 Ci mmole , as described by Sankara et al. The whole pancreas of a male Sprague Dawley rat 200 350 g , which had been sacrificed by decapitation, was dissected free of fat tissue and homogenized in 20 volumes of ice cold 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.7 at 25 C with a Brinkmann Polytron PT 10. The homogenates were centrifuged at 48,000 g for 10 minutes, then the resulting pellets were resuspended in Tris Buffer, centrifuged as above, and resuspended in 200 volumes of binding assay buffer 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.7 at 25 C, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM bacitracin, 1.2 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mN o phenanthroline . For the binding assay, 25 µl of buffer for total binding , or unlabeled CCK 8 sulfate sufficient to give a final concentration of 1µM of CCK 8 for nonspecific binding , or the compounds of the formula of the compounds according to the instant invention for determination of antagonism to ¹²⁵I CCK binding and 25 µl of ¹²⁵I CCK 33 30,000 40,000 cpm , were added to 450 µl of the membrane suspensions in microfuge tubes. All assays were run in duplicate or triplicate, and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes and centrifuged in a Beckman Microfuge 4 minutes immediately after adding 1 ml of ice cold incubation buffer. The supernatant was aspirated and discarded, and the pellets were counted with a Beckman Gamma 5000. For Scatchard analysis to determine the mechanism of inhibition of ¹²⁵I CCK binding by the most potent compounds CCK 33 was radiolabeled and the binding was performed according to the description for the pancreas method, with modifications according to Saito Male Hartley guinea pigs 300 500 g were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brains were removed and placed in ice cold 50 mM Tris HCl Trizma 7.4 pH 7.4 at 25 C . The cerebral cortex was dissected and used as a receptor source and each gram of fresh guinea pig brain tissue was homogenized in 10 ml of Tris Trizma buffer with a Brinkmann polytron PT 10. The homogenates were centrifuged at 42,000g for 15 minutes, then the resulting pellets were resuspended in 80 volumes of binding assay buffer 10 mM N 2 hydroxy ethyl piperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid HEPES , 5 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM ethylene glycol bis β amino ethyl ether N,N tetraacetic acid EGTA , 0.4 BSA and 0.25 mg ml bacitracin, pH 6.5 . The remainder of the binding assay method was as described for the pancreas method, except that the reaction mixtures were incubated at 25 C for 2 hours before centrifugation. The compounds of the instant invention inhibited specific ¹²⁵I CCK 33 binding in a concentration dependent manner, generally with an IC₅₀ less than or equal to 100 µM. An additional method of confirming competitive antagonism of CCK which may be used is the following The two halves of the gall bladders, free of adjacent tissue, of male Hartley guinea pigs 400 600g , which had been sacrificed by decapitation, are suspended under 1g tension along the axis of the bile duct in 5 ml organ bath, containing a Kreb s bicarbonate solution of 118 mM NaCl, 4.75 mM KCl, 2.54 CaCl₂, 1.19 mM KH₂PO₄, 1.2 mM MgSO₄, 25 mM NaHCO₃ and 11 mM dextrose, which is maintained at 32 C and bubbled with a mixture of 95 O₂ and 5 CO₂. The tissues are washed every 10 minutes for 1 hour to obtain equilibrium prior to the beginning of the study and the isometric contractions of the strips are recorded using Statham 60g 0.12 mm strain gauges and a Hewlett Packard 77588 recorder. CCK 8 is added cumulatively to the baths and EC₅₀ s are determined using regression analysis. After washout every 10 minutes for 1 hour , the compound to be tested is added at least 5 minutes before the addition of CCK 8 and the EC₅₀ of CCK 8 in the presence of compound to be tested is similarly determined. A shift to the right of the CCK dose response curve without reduction of the maximal contractile response, indicates competitive antagonism of CCK from this method. The ability of the compounds of the instant invention to antagonize CCK makes these compounds useful as pharmaceutical agents for mammals, especially for humans, for the treatment and prevention of disorders wherein CCK may be involved. Examples of such disease states include gastrointestinal disorders, especially such as irritable bowel syndrome or ulcers, excess pancreatic or gastric secretion, acute pancreatis, or motility disorders central nervous system disorders, caused by CCK interactions with dopamine, such as neuroleptic disorders tardive dyskinesia, Parkinson s disease, psychosis or Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome and disorders of appetite regulatory systems. The compounds of the instant invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be administered to a human subject either alone or, preferably, in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. The compounds can be administered orally or parenterally, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and topical administration. For oral use of an antagonist of CCK, according to this invention, the selected compounds may be administered, for example, in the form of tablets or capsules, or as an aqueous solution or suspension. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch, and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate also, are commonly added. For oral administration in capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and or flavoring agents may be added. For intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intravenous use, sterile solutions of the active ingredient are usually prepared, and the pH of the solutions should be suitably adjusted and buffered. For intravenous use, the total concentration of solutes should be controlled in order to render the preparation isotonic. When a compound according to the instant invention, or a salt thereof, is used as an antagonist of CCK in a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician. Moreover, the dosage will vary according to the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, as well as the severity of the patient s symptoms. However, in most instances, an effective daily dosage will be in the range of from about 0.05 mg kg to about 100 mg kg, and preferably, of from 0.5 mg kg to about 20 mg kg, administered in single or divided doses. In some cases, however, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits. The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples which is intended to be illustrative and not limiting. 1 Methyl 2 aminomethyl 5 2 fluorophenyl 2,3 dihydro 1H 1,4 benzodiazepine 250 mg, 0.88 mmole and 2 indole carboxylic acid 142 mg, 0.88 mmole were combined with 5 ml of dry methylene chloride, and 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride 169 mg, 0.88 mmole was added to this mixture at room temperature.
