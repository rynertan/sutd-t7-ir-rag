# Radiation image recording and read out system.

## Abstract
In a radiation image recording system in which a radiation image is recorded on a stimulable phosphor and then read out to reproduce a visible radiation image, at least one recording material 2 formed of a phosphor layer and fixed on a supporting material 1 is circulated and reused to record radiation images thereon. The system comprises a mechanism 3, 4 for circulating the recording material with respect to the image read out section 7, 8, 9, 10 by repeatedly moving the supporting material and the image read out section with respect to each other, and an erasing apparatus 11 for eliminating the radiation energy remain ing on the recording material after the read out step. The supporting material is and endless belt and the recording layer is a phosphor sheet. In other embodiments the supporting material is a rotatable drum or a plate, and the recording material may be a continuous phosphor layer.
