# Broadband spectrometer with fiber optic reformattor.

## Abstract
The invention provides a system having a broadband spec trometer 20 with a fiber optic reformattor 16 for field use in de tecting and identifying gas clouds within a field of view. The system includes a grating type spectrometer 20, a fiber optic reformattor 16, a focal plane detector array 24 and electronics 42 52 for background signal substraction techniques for gen erating spectral signature data which is analyzed for gas detec tion and outputting a decision making signal for recognition.
