# A heat engine.

## Abstract
A heat engine comprises a casing or block 1 defining a working volume 2, 3 in which is located a movable member 6, 7 such as a piston. A reservoir 4 is provided for a non gaseous material which in use of the engine is vapourised by heating means 5, 50 which heat a portion of a surface 47, 48 delimiting the working volume 2, 3 . Means 40 are provided for the introduction of the non gaseous material into the work ing volume wherein, in use of the engine, the heating means 5, 50 cause the material to vapourise and expand via the surface 47, 48 to act on the movable member 6, 7 to pro duce mechanical work. The heat engine according to the invention can be of a reciprocating or a rotary type.
