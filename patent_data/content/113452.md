# MAGNETIC PARTICLES AS SUPPORTS FOR ORGANIC SYNTHESIS

## Abstract
A support system for organic synthesis comprising magnetic particles in a dispersion medium covalently attached to functional groups having affinity for polymer subunits, and methods for making and using the support system, e.g. for synthesis of oligodeoxynucleotides and polypeptides.
