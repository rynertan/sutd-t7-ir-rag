# Double cylinder press for formation of fibrous layers.

## Abstract
A double cylinder press for the formation of fibrous layers is capable of extracting fibres from fibre containing liquid, causing the fibres to be adsorbed on the surfaces of wire gauzes 41 of cages 40 disposed in a stationary tank 10 and a pivotable tank 12 , allowing masses of fibres produced in the course of the formation of fibrous layers to drop down from above a region in which the cages 40 are brought into pressure contact with each other, to be collected in chambers 46 , and allowing waste liquid resulting from compression and dehydration of the fibres to be dropped and discharged out of the cages of the double cylinder press along inclined drain plates 48 .
