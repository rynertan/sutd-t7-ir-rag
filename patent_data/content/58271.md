# Shared use of microprocessor memory fields.

## Abstract
A microprocessor 10 , having a memory element 18 containing a plurality of multi bit instruction words, an arithmetic logic ALU unit 16 coupled to the memory element 18 and responsive to at least a portion of each of the instruction words for performing data manipulations, and a controller 20 for generating address signals that are communicated to the memory element 18 to cause sequen tial access of the instruction words, includes a storage element 40 that interconnects certain of the signal lines 30,32 that communicate the instruction words to the ALU 16 to the controller 20 . In response to a first predeter mined instruction word the storage element 40 receives and stores the portion of the instruction word being con ducted to the ALU 16 . In response to a second predeter mined instruction word, the content of the storage element 40 is transferred to the controller 20 to form an address signal.
