# Rotary displacement machine.

## Abstract
A method of and means for controlling a clearance in a machine having a rotary element is disclosed. The embodi ment depicted comprises a pair of coacting rotors, in a rotary compressor, having interengaging lobes and grooves, the rotors being journalled in intersecting bores in a housing. The circumferential surfaces, and end walls of the bores are polymer layered, and the rotors carry abrasive to machine the polymer to define an optimum clearance for rotor rotation within the bores, and in coaction together. Each rotor is polymer coated and abrasive particles are borne in the polymer on the outer edges of the lobes and in discrete radial patterns on the rotor sides. The method defines the polymer coating and abrasive particles deposition steps.
