# Improvements in stacking connectors for printed circuit boards and in printed circuit board assemblies employing stacking connectors.

## Abstract
A connector 10 for electrically interconnecting adja cent, parallel, spaced apart printed circuit boards A, B, C etc. includes a housing 12 having a mounting surface 22 or 24 and passageway 26 for receiving a pin like male commoning element 84 or 72 . The connector further includes a stamped, integral terminal 14 mounted in the housing, which has a resilient contact 42 disposed in the pin receiving passageway 26 , and a board engaging portion 18 and or 20 which is secured to at least a first printed circuit board. A connector 10 is provided on each printed circuit board to be electrically interconnected, and the pin receiving passageways 26 are aligned in registry. After installation of the connectors 10 and printed circuit boards A, B, C , the pin like male commoning element 84 or 72 is inserted through the passageways 26 and apertures 74, 76 or 86b, 86c, 86d provided in each printed circuit board adjacent each passageway 26 , so as to engage each contact 42 of each connector 10 to be interconnected.
