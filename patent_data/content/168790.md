# Display device.

## Abstract
Light emitting cells RC, GC, BC of a display device are individually provided with inner walls at least partially covered by white reflectors consisting of glass material WG contain ing transparent particles having different refractive index in an amount of 5 to 80 by weight, so that extremely high luminous efficiency, similar as that of an optical integrating sphere, can be realized. On the other hand, openings for emitting colored light are applied with color filters RF, GF, BF concerned, meanwhile the front surface other than those openings of the display device is covered with light absorbing black material BM , so that the reflectance for incident ambient light can be extremely reduced. According to the multiplexed effect of the above struc ture, remarkably high contrast of display can be readily real ized.
