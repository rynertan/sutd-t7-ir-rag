# Rotary and orbital sander.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a rotary orbital sander and aims at avoiding discomfort on the operator by rotational unba lance and the risk of harm or damage to operator and surroundings, while offering stability and structural rigidity. This sander includes a motor housing 12 , a drive shaft 42 having an offset projecting portion 44 , a pinion gear housing 16 affixed to the motor housing 12 , a carrier 50 supported upon the shaft off set projecting portion 44 by two parallel arranged ball bearings 48 , a sanding pad assemblage 60 removably attached to the carrier 50 , intermeshing spur gears 54, 52 arranged on the pinion gear housing 16 and the carrier 50 , and a counter balance weight 62 rotating with the shaft portion 44 and having a particular position of its center of gravity, said pinion gear housing 16 having a circular cavity 56 surrounding the carrier 50 and engageable thereby at 58 as it revolves, to provide rotational support for the carrier 50 .
