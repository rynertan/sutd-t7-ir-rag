# A process for the catalytic gasification of carbonaceous materials.

## Abstract
A process for the catalytic gasification of carbonaceous materials is performed in the presence of a catalyst compris ing an added potassium salt of an acid having an ionization constant exceeding 10 ³, which salt has relatively poor cataly tic activity compared to the activity of potassium carbonate and a sodium or lithium compound. The sodium or lithium compound is either a salt of a weak acid having an ionization constant of less than 10 ³ or a salt of a strong acid that is converted temporarily or permanently to a salt of a weak acid having an ionization constant less than 10 ³, under the condition of the gasification reactions. High gasification rates may thus be achieved employing catalyst materials which are relatively cheaper than potassium carbonate.

## Description
A Process for the Catalytic Gasification of Carbonaceous Materials The present invention relates to a process for the catalytic gasification of carbonaceous materials such as oils, petroleum residua, coals and the like, and is particularly concerned with the catalytic gasification operations carried out in the presence of alkali metalcontaining catalysts. It has long been recognised that certain alkali metal compounds can be employed to catalyze the gasification of carbonaceous materials such as coal and other carbonaceous solids. Studies have shown that potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate and lithium carbonate will substantially accelerate the rate at which steam, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen and the like react with bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite, petroleum coke, organic waste materials and similar carbonaceous solids to form methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and other gaseous products. Other alkali metal salts such as alkali metal chlorides, however, have a low catalytic activity when compared to that of the corresponding carbonate.Because of the relatively high cost of cesium carbonate and the low effectiveness of lithium and sodium carbonates, most of the experimental work in this area which has been carried out in the past has been directed toward the use of potassium carbonate. In addition to utilizing individual alkali metal salts as a catalyst for the gasification of a carbonaceous material, it has been proposed to utilize mixtures of alkali petal salts. When such mixtures of alkali metal salts are used to promote the gasification of a carbonaceous feed material, it is expected that the mixture will accelerate the gasification reactions less than if an equivalent amount of the more active alkali metal compound is used alone and more than if an equivalent amount of the less active alkali metal salt is employed. In gasification processes using alkali metal containing catalysts, the cost of the catalyst is a significant factor in determing the overall cost of the product gas. Potassium carbonate is relatively expensive. The costs of other alkali metal compounds such as potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate are substantially cheaper than potassium carbonate but these compounds exhibit only a fraction of the catalytic activity exhibited by potassium carbonate. It would be highly desirable if the compounds mentioned above and other more abundant, less expensive potassium and sodium compounds could be effectively used as gasification catalysts thereby substantially decreasing the initial investment required in the catalyst and obviating the need for expensive secondary recovery techniques to decrease the amount of makeup alkali compounds that would otherwise be required to maintain the catalyst inventory at the required level. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved process for the catalytic gasification of a carbonaceous feed material. In accordance with the invention, it has now been found that catalyst costs incurred during the gasification of oils, petroleum residua, bituminous coa , subbituminous coal, lignite, organic waste material, petroleum coke, and other carbonaceous feed materials can be significantly reduced while at the same time obtaining unexpectedly high gasification rates by employing mixtures of inexpensive potassium compounds and sodium compounds as the catalyst. Laboratory tests have shown that when mixtures of coal, potassium chloride or potassium sulfate, and sodium carbonate or sodium sulfate are injected into a reaction zone and the coal is subsequently gasified, surprisingly high gasification rates are obtained. These gasification rates are substantially higher than expected based on the low activity of the individual potassium and sodium compounds relative to that of potassium carbonate. This is a significant and unexpected discovery since the observed gasification rates are high enough to enable mixtures of these inexpensive potassium and sodium salts to be used as gasification catalysts in lieu of the substantially more expensive potassium carbonate.Because of the quantities in which catalysts are required in catalytic gasification operations, the overall savings made possible in a large gasification plant by the invention may be quite substantial. In general, unexpectedly high gasification rates will be obtained when a carbonaceous feed material is introduced into a reaction zone along with a mixture of a potassium compound having a relatively poor catalytic activity as compared to that of potassium carbonate and a sodium or lithium compound selected from the group consisting of a weak acid salt of sodium or lithium and a strong acid salt of sodium or lithium that is converted to a weak acid salt in the reaction zone at reaction conditions, and the carbonaceous material is subsequently gasified.For mixtures of certain relatively noncatalytic potassium and sodium compounds, the gasification rate obtained will be nearly as great as the rate obtained when potassium carbonate alone is introduced into the reaction zone with the feed material in an amount that yields the same alkali metal to carbon atomic ratio as that of the mixture.Evidently, the sodium or lithium compound activates the poorly catalytic potassium compound thereby producing a substantial catalytic effect on the gasification rate of the carbonaceous feed material. In accordance with the invention, the use of catalysts containing mixtures of inexpensive potassium and sodium compounds reduces the initial catalyst cost and the cost of makeup catalyst and at the same time permits the attainment of high gasification rates. The use of such mixtures also obviates the need for expensive secondary catalyst recovery procedures. As a result, the invention makes possible substantial savings in gasification operations and permits the generation of product gases at significantly lower cost than would normally otherwise be the case.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 in the drawing is a schematic flow diagram of a process for the gasification of coal carried out in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a plot illustrating that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by using a mixture of potassium sulfate and sodium carbonate which is equimolar in potassium and sodium to catalyze the gasification of a carbonaceous material Figure 3 is a plot illustrating that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by using a mixture of potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate which is equimolar in potassium and sodium to catalyze the gasification of a carbonaceous material Figure 4 is a plot illustrating that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by using a mixture of potassium sulfate and sodium chloride which is equimolar in potassium and sodium to catalyze the gasification of a carbonaceous material Figure 5 is a plot illustrating that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by using a mixture of potassium sulfate and sodium nitrate which is equimolar in potassium and sodium to catalyze the gasification of a carbonaceous material Figure 6 is a plot illustrating that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by using a mixture of potassium chloride and sodium carbonate which is equimolar in potassium and sodium to catalyze the gasification of a carbonaceous material Figure 7 is a plot illustrating that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by using a mixture of potassium chloride and sodium sulfate which is equimolar in potassium and sodium to catalyze the gasification of a carbonaceous material Figure 8 is a plot illustrating that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by using a mixture of potassium and lithium to catalyze the gasification of a carbonaceous material Figure 9 is a plot illustrating that the addition of small amounts of various sodium salts will activate relatively noncatalytic potassium sulfate thereby rapidly increasing the gasification rate of a carbonaceous material and Figure 10 is a plot illustrating that the catalytic gasification acitivty of relatively noncatalytic potassium chloride can be substantially increased by adding sodium carbonate in an amount sufficient to yield a sodium to potassium mole ratio of 1.0 or greater. DESCRIPTZON OF ThE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The process depicted in Figure 1 is one for the gasification of bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite, organic waste materials or similar carbonaceous solids in the presence of added sodium and potassium compounds. It will be understood that the invention is not restricted to this particular gasification process and instead may be employed in any of a wide variety of fixed bed, moving bed and fluidized bed gasification operations in whick alkali metal compounds are used to promote the reaction of steam, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, or a similar gasification agent with carbonaceous feed materials and a char, coke or other solid product containing alkali metal residues is recovered.Many such operations have been described in the technical literature and will be familiar to those skilled in the art. In the process shown, a solid carbonaceous feed material such as bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, lignite or the like, which has been crushed and screened to a particle size of about 8 mesh or smaller on the U.S. Sieve SeriesScale is fed into the. system through line 10 from a coal preparation plant our storage facility which is not shown in the drawing. The solids introduced through line 10 are fed into a hopper or similar vessel 12 from which they are passed through line 13 into a feed preparation zone 14.The feed preparation zone shown includes a screw conveyor or similar device, not shown in the drawing, which is powered by a motor 16, a series of spray nozzles or the like 17 for the spraying of a solution of soluble alkali metal compounds introduced through line 18 onto the solids as they are moved through the preparation zone by the conveyor, and nozzles or the like 19 for the introduction of steam from line 20 into the preparation zone to heat the solids and drive off moisture. The alkali metal solution fed through line 18 is prepared by introducing soluble sodium and potassium salts or other sodium and potassium compounds into mixing vessel 21 as indicated by lines 22 and 23, respectively and dissolving these in water or other suitable solvent solution admitted through line 24.Alkali metal solution recycled from the catalyst recovery zone through line 25 as described hereafter may also be used.Steam is withdrawn from the preparation zone 14 through line 28 and will normally be passed to a condenser or heat exchanger not shown for the recovery of heat and condensate which can be used as makeup water or the like. The potassium compound introduced into mixing vessel 21 through line 23 will normally be an inexpensive compound which has a relatively poor catalytic activity as compared to that of potassium carbonate. Relatively poor catalytic activity as compared to that of potassium carbonate11 as used herein refers to a gasification rate obtained from gasifying a carbonaceous material in the presence of a sufficient amount of potassium compound to yield an atomic ratio of potassium cations to carbon atoms of about .03 or greater that is about one half or less that of the rate obtainable by gasifying the same material in the presence of an equi valent amount of potassium carbonate.Examples of such po tassium compounds include potassium chloride, potassium sul fate, and similar potassium salts of a strong acid. Strong acid as used herein refers to an organic or inorganic acid having an ionization constant greater than about lxlO 3 at 250C. The sodium compound introduced into mixing vessel 21 through line 22 will normally be either a sodium sält of a weak acid or a sodium salt of a strong acid that is con verted, either temporarily or permanently, into a weak acid salt of sodium when subjected to gasification conditions in the presence of the potassium compound. Weak acid as used herein refers to an organic or inorganic acid having an ioni zation constant less than about 1 x 10 3 at 250C. Examples of suitable sodium compounds that are salts of weak acids in dude sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate sodium Sulfide, sodium oxalate, sodium acetate, and the like. Examples of sodium salts of strong acids that may be used in conjunction with potassium sulfate because they are temporar ily or permanently converted to weak acid salts include sodium chloride, sodium sulfate and sodium nitrate. The actual so dium compound used will normally depend upon its availability, cost, degree of solubility and the potassium compound uti lized. It has been surprisingly found that when mixtures of the potassium and sodium compounds referred to above are in jected into a catalytic gasification zone with a carbonaceous feed material which is subsequently gasified in the zone, gas ification rates are obtained that are much higher than those that would normally be expected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Apparently, the poorly catalytic potassium compound activated by the sodium compound thereby producing a substan tial catalytic effect on the gasification rate of the carbon aceous feed material. Normally a concentration of the sodium compound sufficient to yield a sodium to potassium mole ratio of 1.0 will completely activate the potassium compound.In some mixtures, however, leaser amounts of the sodium compound may be used to activate the potassium compound without ruch activity loss. The actual mechanism by which the sodium compound activates the potassium compound in the presence of tlie carbonaceous feed material and under gasification conditions is not fully understood. It is believed, however, that certain interactions between the compounds take place which eventually result in transforming the poorly catalytic strong acid salt of potassium into a catalytically active weak acid salt. For example, the following equations are believed to represent the reactions that take place when the potassium compound utilized is potas 4uz sulfate and the sodium compound utilized is sodium carbonate.EMI8.1 As can be seen in equations l and 2 , the anion associated with the potassium compound and the anion associated with the sodium compound exchange with one another to produce K2C03 and Na2SO4, which is reduced in the presence of carbon, hydrogen or carbon monoxide under gasification conditions to Na2S.The Na2S then undergoes an anion exchange with the K2S04 to produce K2S and additional Na2SO4, which also is reduced toNa2S. The net results of these reactions is the conversion of the poorly catalytic K2S04, a strong acid salt of potassium into catalytically active K2C03 and FS, weak acid salts of potassium. The Na2S that is formed is also catalytically ac tive and is believed to add to the overall resultant catalytic activity of the original combination. It is believed that the weak acid salts, K2C03, R2S and Na2S, react with the acidic carbonaceous solids to form an alkali metal char sale , which is believed to be the active site in gasification.Thus, in the case where the potassium compound is h S04 and the sodium compound is Na2C03, both the potassium and sodium cations end up catalyzing the gasification of the carbonaceous solids. If the potassium compound is potassium sulfate and the sodium compound is sodium sulfate, the following equations are believed to represent the reactions that take place. K2S04 Na2SO4 3 EMI9.1 In the above illustrated case, an anion exchange cannot take place between K2SO4 and Na2SO4. since the anians are identical.It is theorized, however, that the strong acid salt Na2SO4 is reduced in the presence of carbon, carbon monoxide or hydrogen under gasification conditions to the weak acid saltNa2S, which then undergoes an anion exchange with the K2S04 to produce hS and Na2SO4. The Na2S04 thus formed is also reduced in the presence of carbon, carbon monoxide or hydrogen to Na2S. The net result of these reactions is the formation of catalytically active K2S and Na2S and therefore, like the example illustrated in equations 1 and 2 above, both the potassium and sodium cations end up catalyzing the gasification of the carbonaceous solids. It is believed that equations 5 and 6 set forth below represent the mechanism by which potassium sulfate is activated by sodium chloride.EMI9.2 As can be seen, the potassium and sodium compounds exchange anions thereby forming nd Na2SO4. The Na2SO4 is then reduced under gasification conditions and in the presence of carbon, hydrogen or carbon monoxide to Na2S, which undergoes an anion exchange with KC1 to yield catalytically active hS and catalytically inactive NaCI, one of the original reactants. Thus, unlike the examples illustrated in equations 1 through 4 above, only the potassium cations end up catalyzing the gasification reactions. As stated previously, any weak acid salt of sodium may be used to activate the relatively noncatalytic potassium compound however, only certain strong acid sodium salts will be effective for this purpose. In general, only strong acid salts of sodium that are either temporarily or permanently converted to weak acid sodium salts under gasification conditions and in the presence of the potassium compound to be activated can be utilized. The examples illustrated by equations 3 through 6 above represent two cases in which relatively noncatalytic K2S04 is activated by a strong acid sodium salt that is converted into a weak acid salt. In the example illustrated by equations 3 and 4 , the strong acid sodium salt Na2SO4 undergoes reduction and is thereby permanently converted to the weak acid salt Na2S.In the example illustrated by equations 5 and 6 , the strong acid salt NaCl is converted to the weak acid salt Na2S in a two step process. First the NaC1 participates in an anion exchange with the h S04 to form the strong acid salt Na2S04 which then undergoes reduction to Na2S. The Ways, however, then exchanges anions with KC1 to reform the strong acid salt NaCl.This example, therefore, represents a case where a strong acid sodium salt is only temporarily converted to a weak acid salt. An example of a strong acid salt oi sodium which is neither temporarily nor permanently converted to a weak acid sodium salt under gasification conditions in the presence of K2S04 and therefore will not activate FS04 is Na3P04. The total quaty of the sodium and potassium compounds used should normally be sufficient to provide a combined added alkali metal to carbon atomic ratio in excess of about .03 1. Generally speaking, from about 5 to about 507.by weight of sodium and potassium compounds, based on the coal or other carbonaceous feed material will be employed. Front about 107. to about 357e by weight is generally preferred. The higher the mineral content of the feed material, the more sodium and potassium compounds that should normally be used. Referring again to Figure 1, the feed solids which are impregnated with sodium and potassium compounds in feed preparation zone 14 are withdrawn through line 30 and passed to a feed hopper or similar vessel 31. From here they are discharged through a star wheel feeder or a similar device 32 in line 33 at an elevated pressure sufficient to permit their entrainment in a stream of steam, recycle product gas, inert gas or other carrier gas introduced into the system through line 34.The carrier gas and entrained solids are passed through line 35 into manifold 36 and fed through mfiltiple feed lines 37 and nozzles, not shown in the drawing, into gasifier 38. In lieu of or in addition to hopper 31 and star wheel feeder 32, the feed system employed may include parallel lock hoppers, pressurized hoppers, aerated standpipes operated in series, or other apparatus for raising the input feed solid stream to the required pressure level. Gasifier 38 comprises a refractory lined vessel containing afluidized bed of carbonaceous solids extending upward within the vessel above an internal grid or similar distribution device not shown in the drawing. The solids are maintained in the fluidized state within the gasifier by means of a mixture of steam and oxygen injected through bottom inlet line 39 and multiple nozzles 40 connected to manifold 41.Sufficient oxygen is added to the steam through line 42 to maintain the fluidized bed at a temperature within the range between about 1200OF and about 2000OF. The gasifier pressure will normally be between about 100 psig and about 2000 psig.Under these conditions, the added sodium and potassium compounds result in the production of an unexpected and substan tidal catalytic effect on the steam gasification reaction thereby resulting in the production of a gas composed primarily of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Other reactions will also take place and some methane will normally be formed depending on the gasification conditions. The gas leaving the fluidized bed in gasifier 38 passes through the upper section of the gasifier, which serves as a disengagement zone where particles too heavy to be entrained by the gas leaving the vessell are returned to the bed. If desired, this disengagement zone may include oneor more cyclone separators or the like for removing relatively large particles from the gas. The gas withdrewn from the upper part of the gasifier through line 43 is passed to cyclone separator or similar device 44 for removal of larger fines. The overhead gas then passes through line 46 into a second separator 47 where smaller particles are removed. The gas from which the solids have been separated is taken overhead from separator 47 through line 48 and the fines are discharged downward through dip legs 45 and 49.These fines may be returned to the gasifier or passed to the catalyst recovery section of the process as discussed hereafter. After entrained solids have been separated from the raw product gas, the gas stream may be passed through suitable heat exchange equipment for the recovery of heat and subsequently passed downstream for further processing. Char particles containing carbonaceous material, ash and alkali metal residues are continuously withdrawn through line 50 from the bottom of the fluidized bed in gasifier 38. The particles flow downward through line 50 counter current to a stream of steam or other elutriating gas introduced through line 51. Here a preliminary separation of solids based on differences in size and density takes place.The lighter particles containing a relatively large amount of carbonaceous material tend to be returned to the gasifier and the heavier particles having a relatively high content of ash and alkali metal residues continue downward through line 52 into fluidized bed withdrawal zone 53. Steam or othefluidizing gas is introduced into the bottom of the withdrawn zone through line 54 to maintain the bed in the fluidized state. Water may be introduced through line 55 in order to cool the particles and facilitate their further processing.The withdrawal rate is controlled by regulating the pressure within zone 53 by means of throttle valve 56 in overhead line 57. The gases from line 57 may be returned to the gasifier through line 58 or vented through valve 59. From vessel 53 the solid particles are passed through line 60 containing valve 61 into hopper 62. The char fines recovered from the raw product gas through dip legs 45 and 49 may be combined with the char particles withdrawn from the gasifier by passing the fines through line 63 into hopper 62. The particles in hopper 62 will contain sodium and potassium residues composed of water soluble and water in soluble sodium and potassium compounds. These particles are passed from hopper 62 through line 64 into catalyst recovery unit 65. The catalyst recovery unit will normally comprise a multistage countercurrent extraction system in which the particles containing the sodium and potassium residues are countercurrently contacted with water introduced through line 66. An aqueous solution of sodium and potassium compounds is recovered from the unit and may be recycled through lines 67 and 25 to the catalyst preparation unit or mixing vessel 21.Particles from which substantially all of the soluble sodium and potassium constituents have been extracted are withdrawn from the catalyst recovery unit through line 68. These solids will normally contain substantial quantities of sodium and potassium present in the form of sodium and potassium aluminosilicates and other water insoluble compounds. These compounds are formed in part by the reaction with the ash in the coal and other feed material of sodium and potassium compounds added to catalyze the gasification reaction. In general, from about 15Z to as much as 50 of the added alkali metal constituents will be converted into alkali metal aluminosilicates and other water insoluble compounds. By employing a mixture of inexpensive potassium and sodium compounds in accordance with the process of the invention in lieu of the more expensive potassium carbonate and other previously known catalysts, the need to recover and reuse the sodium and potassium compounds tied up as water insoluble alkali metal residues by expensive and sophisticated secondary recovery methods is obviated. In the embodiment of the invention described above, the feed solids are impregnated with a solution containing a mixture of sodium and potassium compounds prior to their introduction into the gasifier 38. It will be understood that other methods of introducing the sodium and potassium compounds into the gasification zone may be utilized. For example, the compounds may be mixed in the solid state with the carbonaceous feed particles and the mixture may be subse . quently passed into the gasifier. In some cases it may be desirable to introduce the feed solids, the sodium compound and the potassium compound through separate lines into gasifier 38. Other methods for separate introduction of the sodium and potassium compounds into this system will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The nature and objects of the invention are further illustrated by the results of laboratory gasification studies which show that unexpectedly high gasification rates are obtained by utilizing certain combinations of sodium and potassium compounds, and lithium and potassium compounds as catalysts. In all of the tests, about 2 grams of Illinois No. 6 coal crushed to between about 30 and about 100 mesh on theU.S. Sieve Series Scale was mixed with varying amounts Of finely divided alkali metal compounds and combinations of such compounds. The resultant mixture was then dampened with about one milliliter of distilled water and pyrolyzed for about 15 minutes at about 1400OF in a retort under an inert nitrogen atmosphere.A portion of the resultant char, containing between about 0.2 and about 0.5 grams of carbon, was then steam gasified at a temperature of about 1300OF and essentially atmospheric pressure in a laboratory bench scale gasification unit. The gasification rate obtained for each char sample was determined. The char not gasified was ashed to determine the amount of carbon present and the alkali metal cation to carbon atomic ratio was then calculated. The results of these tests are set forth in Figures 2 through 10.In all cases the gasification rate is expressed as the conversion weighted average rate in percent of carbon present per hour over the interval of 0 907. carbon conversion. Figure 2 sets forth the steam gasification rate data obtained from char impregnated with various concentrations of potassium carbonate, potassium sulfate, sodium carbonate and a mixture of potassium sulfate and sodium carbonate. It can be seen in Figure 2 that the relatively expensive potassium carbonate yielded much greater gasification rates than did the less expensive potassium sulfate and sodium carbonate and is therefore a much more active gasification catalyst than either of the latter two compounds. The dashed line in Figure 2 represents the gasification rates that one of ordinary skill in the art would expect to observe if a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium sulfate which is equimolar in sodium and potassium moles Wa X 1.0 was used as a catalyst. The expected gasification rate for such a mixture that yields an atomic ratio of .066 alkali metal cations per carbon atom was calculated as follows.The observed rate of about 517c carbon per hour for a concentration of sodium carbonate that yielded an atomic ratio of .066 sodium cations per carbon atom was added to the observed rate of about 9.0 carbon per hour for a concentration of potassium sulfate that yielded an atomic ratio of .066 potassium cations per carbon atom and the resultant value of 60 carbon per hour was divided by 2 to yield the expected rate of 30 carbon per hour. This rate was then plotted against the atomic ratio of .066 cations per carbon atom where .033 of the cations were potassium cations and the other .033 were sodium cations.The expected gasification rates for mixtures of sodium carbonate and potassium sulfate that are equimolar in sodium and potassium but yield alkali metal cation to carbon atomic ratios of other values were calculated in a manner similar to that described above. As can be seen in Figure 2, the actual gasification rates observed using mixtures of potassium sulfate and sodium carbonate were much greater than the expected rates represented by the dashed line and approached the rates obtainable with equivalent concentrations of potassium carbonate. The actual observed gasification rate for an atomic ratio of .066 potassium and sodium cations per carbon atom was 837. carbon per hour as compared to the 30 carbon per hour that was expected.Furthermore, the actual observed rate of 835 carbon per hour for the mixture at an atomic ratio of .066 potassium and sodium cations per carbon atom is much greater than the 9.0Z per hour obtained for potassium sulfate at an atomic ratio of .066 potassium cations per carbon atom and is also greater than the 517. carbon per hour obtained for sodium carbonate at an atomic ratio of .066 sodium cations per carbon atom. In view of the foregoing, the gasification rates obtained using mixtures of potassium sulfate and sodium carbonate as a catalyst are surprising and unexpected. The data set forth in Figures 3 through 5 indicate that surprisingly high gasification rates can also be obtained by utilizing potassium sulfate in combination with various sodium salts other than sodium carbonate. Figure 3 shows that unexpectedly high rates are obtained using mixtures of potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate that are equimolar in potassium and sodium as a gasification catalyst. Figure 5 makes a similar showing for mixtures of potassium sulfate and sodium nitrate that are equimolar in potassium and sodium.In both Figures the rates one of ordinary skill in the art would expect are represented by dashed lines and were c cu lated as discussed previously in reference to Figure 2. Figure 4 shows that surprisingly high gasification rates are obtained using mixtures of potassium sulfate and sodium chloride that are equimolar in potassium and sodium. In Figur0 4 the gasification rates for potassium sulfate alone and for sodium chloride alone fall on the same line. This line, therefore, also represents the gasification rates that would be expected for mixtures of the two salts that are equimolar in potassium and sodium. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate that catalysts comprised of a mixture of potassium chloride and one of various inexpensive sodium salts will yield higher than expected gasification rates when the catalyst concentration is above a certain value. Figute 6 shows that surprisingly high rates are obtained when a mixture of potassium chloride and sodium carbonate that is equimolar in potassium and sodium is employed in sufficient concentrations to yield an atomic ratio greater than about .08 alkali metal cations per carbon atom. Figure 7 makes a similar showing for a mixture of potassium chloride and sodium sulfate that is equimolar in potassium and sodium.As in previous Figures, the expected gasification rates are represented by a dashed line and were calculated as described in reference to Figure 2. Figure 8 illustrates that a catalyst comprised of a mixture of a relatively noncatalytic potassium salt and a lithium salt in lieu of a sodium salt will also yield unexpectedly high gasification rates. It can be seen inFigure 8 that surprisingly high gasification rates are obtained when char is gaslfied in the presence of a mixture of potassium sulfate and lithium sulfate that is equimolar in potassium and lithium. As in prior Figures, the dashed line represents the gasification rate that would be expected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Figure 9 shows the gasification rates obtained whenIllinois No. 6 coal char was gasified in the presence of catalysts comprised of mixtures of potassium sulfate and varying amounts of either sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate or sodium chloride. In all cases the potassium sulfate was present in quantities such that the atomic ratio of potassium cations to carbon atoms ranged between about .051 and about .057. The amount of the particular sodium salt present was varied over a range such that the ratio of sodium cations to potassium cations present per carbon atom ranged from .25 to 1.0. This ratio Na K is indicated next to each point plotted in the Figure. For comparison purposes, the rate of 8X carbon per hour obtained for the use of potassium sulfate alone Na K n O is also shown in the Figure.It can be seen from the plotted data that for each combination of potassium sulfate and one of the three sodium salts, the presence of only a small amount of the sodium salt Na K .25 resulted in a sharp increase in the gasification rate over that for a zero concentration of the sodium salt. The gasification rate continued to increase as the amount of the sodium salt in the mixture was increased up to a sodium to potassium atomic ratio of 1.0. Figure 10 is a plot similar to that of Figure 9 except that the gasification rates plotted are for a catalyst comprised of a mixture of potassium chloride and varying amounts of sodium carbonate. For comparison purposes, the rate of 18 carbon per hour for the use of potassium chloride alone Na K s O is also shown in the Figure. As can be seen in the Figure, small amounts of the sodium carbonate Na K .26to .49 do not substantially increase the gasification rate. It is only when the amount of sodium carbonate in the mixture is sufficient to provide a sodium to potassium atomic ratio of 1.0 or greater that the gasification rate rises rapidly. In view of the data set forth in Figures 9 and 10, it can be concluded that small amounts of certain sodium compounds will catalytically activate poorly catalytic potassium sulfate whereas greater amounts are necessary to activate poorly catalytic potassium chloride. It will be apparent from the foregoing that the invention provides a process for gasifying a carbonaceous material which makes it possible to employ mixtures of inexpensive alkali metal salts as catalysts and at the same time at tain gasification rates nearly as high as those obtainable by the use of expensive potassium carbonate. As a result, the overall cost of the product gas may be substantially reduced. Temperatures given herein in OF are convertible to OC by subtracting 32 and then dividing by 1.8.
