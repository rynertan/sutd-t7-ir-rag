## Description
The present invention relates to thiatriazine derivatives which have histamine H 2 antagonist activity. The invention also relates to processes for the preparation of these derivatives, to pharmaceutical preparations comprising them, and to their use. Histamine is one of a number of naturally occurring physiologically active substances which are thought to interact with specific receptors. In the case of histamine, there are at least two types one is called H l receptor Ash and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmac. 1966, 27 427 , and the other is called the H 2 receptor Black et al Nature 1972, 236, 385 . The action of histamine at the H receptors, for example, stimulation of bronchial and gastro intestinal smooth muscle, is blocked by the compounds generally known as antihistamines , but which are now also called histamine H l antagonists, for example, mepyramine.The action of histamine at the H 2 receptors, for example, stimulation of gastric acid secretion and heart rate, is not blocked by mepyramine, but is blocked by other compounds, for example, burimamide and cimetidine. Histamine H 2 antagonists may be used to treat those conditions resulting from stimulation by histamine of H 2 receptors, either alone, for example, in inhibiting gastric acid secretion and thus treating its sequelae, for example, gastric and peptic ulcers or together with H l antagonists, for example, in allergic and certain inflammatory conditions. The present invention provides compounds of the general formula I, which are histamine H 2 antagonists EMI1.1 in which formula represents a phenyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, furyl, thienyl, or pyridyl radical which radical may contain one or two substitutents, the first being selected from lower alkyl groups, and the second from lower alkyl, guanidino, and CH2NRÚRê groups, RÚ and Rê, which may be the same or different, each representing a hydro gen atom or a C1 C6 alkyl group, or together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, may form a pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, or N methylpipera zine ring X represents 0 , S , or CH2 n represents 0 or 1 m represents 2 or 3 p represents 1 or 2 R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl, C3 C6 alkynyl, phenyl, phenyl lower alkyl, carboxylic acyl C1 C6 , phenyl lower acyl, nitrile, or N alkyl 2 group R4 represents a hydrogen atom, a C1 C6 alkyl, C2 C6 alkenyl, C C6 alkynyl, phenyl or phenyl lower alkyl group, an O lower alkyl or Oaryl group, a nitrile group, or an NR5R6 group, in which R5 and R6, which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, a C1 C6 alkyl, tC2 C6 alkenyl, C3 C6 alkynyl, C3 C7 cycloalkyl, phenyl or phenyl lower alkyl group, a CH2 m X CH2 n A group, or an NH2 or nitrile group m, n, X and A being as defined above , or together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached may form a 5 or 6 membered ring optionally containing a second nitrogen atom or an oxygen atom, orR3 and 4 together with the atoms to which they are attached may form a 5 or 6 membered ring, containing one or more further heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur atoms.This invention also provides salts of a compound of formula I, especially physiologically tolerable salts. Alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and acyl groups in the present specification may be branched or unbranched and may be unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by one or more groups selected from hydroxyl groups OR7 groups in which n7 represents a C1 C alkyl group, C3 C7 cycloalkyl or a phenyl group NR R groups in which R 8 ana R , which may be the same or different, each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an aryl group or a lower acyl group, and may together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a 5 or 6 membered ring COOR 10 groups in which R10 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkali metal atom, for example, Na or K, or a lower alkyl group CONR8R9 in which R8 and R9 are as defined above lower alkylsulphonyl and arylsulphonyl groups cyano groups and phenyl groups which may be substituted by one or two substituent which may be the same or different selected from a lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, methylenedioxy, phenoxy, halogen, dimethylaminomethyl, trifluoromethyl, nitro, cyano, sulphonic acid, sulphonamide, amino, mono lower alkyl, amino di lower alkyl amino groups aromatic and non aromatic heterocyclic groups having 5 to 8 ring members and one or two hetero atoms selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen, and optionally having a lower alkyl substituent on a ring nitrogen atom, for example, furyl, tetrahydrofuryl, thienyl, pyridyl, dihydropyranyl, pyrrolidi nyl, N lower alkyl, pyrrolidinyl and piperidyl substituent. A phenyl group other than a phenyl group A which is defined above may be unsubstituted or substituted as defined immediately above for phenyl substituents of aliphatic and acyl groups. In the present specification the term 1lower 1 is used to denote a group having up to 4 carbon atoms. The term halogen denotes chlorine, bromine, iodine and fluorine. The term arylil , unless otherwise described, denotes aroma tics having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, naphthyl, bisphenylyl, particularly phenyl aralkyl means aralkyls having 7 to 13 C atoms, such as benzyl, phenethyl. It will be appreciated by a worker skilled in the art that a combination of substituents that are incompatible for steric reasons or because of potential inter reactions should not be chosen. The worker will also use his normal discretion in the number of substituents chosen. The present invention also provides a process for the production of a compound of the general formula I, which comprises a reacting a 1,2,4,6 thiatriazine of the general formula IIEMI4.1 in which L1 represents a halogen atom, an alkoxy or aryloxy group, an alkylthio or arylthio group, or an alkylsulphonyl 11 or arylsulphonyl group, p and R4 are as defined above, and R 3a us as defined above for R3 except that R3a may not represent a hydrogen atom, with a compound of the general formula III A CH2 n X CH2 m NH2 III in which A, X, m and n are as defined for formula I, or b reacting a 1,2,4,6 thiatriazine of the general formula IVEMI5.1 in which L1 and L2, which may be the same or different, each represents a halogen atom, an alkoxy or aryloxy group, an alkylthio or arylthio group, or an alkylsulphonyl or arylsulphonyl group, and p and R a are as defined above, with a compound of formula III as defined above, and reacting the resulting compound of formula VEMI5.2 with an amino compound HNR5aR6a in which R5a and R 6a are as defined for R5 and R in formula I and, in addition, either or both of R5a and R 6a may represent a trialkylsilyl group, for example, a CH3 3Si group or c reacting a 1,2,11,6 thiatriazine of the general formula II as defined above with an amino thiol of formula VI HXa OH2 m NH2 VI in which Xa is O or S , and m is as defined for formula I, and reacting the resulting a compound of formula VIIEMI6.1 in which R3 R R4, p and m are as defined above, with a com pound of the general formula VIII A CH2 n1 L VIII in which A is as defined for formula I, n1 represents 1, and L3 is a suitable leaving group, for example, a halogen atom, a hydroxy group, an alkoxy group, or a sulphonate ester, and, if desired, carrying out any one or more of the following reactings in any desired order i converting a group R3a into a hydrogen atom, ii converting a group R3 and or a group R4 into an other group R and or R4, respectively, iii converting an acid addition salt of formula I into the corresponding free base or converting a free base into an acid addition salt, iv oxidising a compound or formula I in which p repre sents 1 to give the corresponding compound in which p represents 2. In addition to serving as a substituent in the final product, R3 may also act as a protecting group in the above chemical transformations and may subsequently be removed, for example, by hydrogenolysis or by acid or base catalysed hydrolysis to provide a compound of the general formula I in which the thiatriazine ring carries a hydrogen substituent. Protecting groups which come within the definition of given in formula I are t butyl, lower alkyl carbonate, benzyl and benzoyl groups, for example. Oxidation may be carried out by a know method, for example, as described below. Interconversions of substitutents may also be carried out by known methods, for example, the hydrolysis of a cyano group to an acid or amide. Compounds II and III are generally reacted in a solvent or diluent, preferably an alcohol, DMF, or DMSO, at a temperature within the range of from, for example, from 0 to 1000C, generally from 0 to 600C. The compound of formula III should be reacted in the form of the free base, as shown. If it is initially present in the form of an acid addition salt, for example, as the hydrochloride or hydrobromide, this should be converted into the free base during or, preferably, after reaction with compound II. Conversion is carried out with a base, for example, triethylamine, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Compound IV is reacted with compound III under con di tions similar to those described above, except that generally lower reaction temperatures are preferred in order that the leaving groups L1 and L2 may be displaced selectively. The reaction of compound V with an amino compoundHNR5aR6a is generally carried out in an alcoholic solvent at a temperature from 0 to 600C. The reaction in all cases is faster when p 2 than when p 1. A compound of formula I may be converted into its salt form in the usual manner by reaction with an acid. Examples of physiologically tolerable acid addition salts are those with hydrobromic, hydrochloric, sulphuric, acetic, malonic, maleic, fumaric, succinic, citric, tartaric and isethionic acids. A compound of formula I in the form of an acid addition salt may be converted into the free base form by reaction with a base in the usual manner. A number of compounds of the type represented by the general formula III are known, see, for example, GB Specification 2,001,624 A U.S. Patent 3,950,333 U.S. Patent 4,128,658 and Belgian Patents 867,106 and 875,846. A few examples of the required thiatriazine intermediates represented by the general formulae II, IV and VI are disclosed in the chemical literature, see for example,German specification DE 2,026,625 and DE 2,943,703 U.S.patent 4,013,447 Heterocycles 12, 1199 1979 and Chem.Ber. 109 2107 1976 . However, many of the specific intermediates required for the present invention have not previously been described and form part of the present invention. Some thiatriazines of the general formula II may be prepared as shown in Scheme I. Scheme IEMI8.1 R11 represents an alkyl, dialkylamino, acylamino, nitro, halogen, aryl, nitrile, alkoxy, aryloxy or acyloxy group, and x represents 1 or 2. Preferably one group R11 is present, ortho or, preferably, para to the OCN group. Sulphamide IX may be reacted with an aryl cyanate of formula X in the presence of a base, for example, Na2O03, according to the method described in DE 2,026,625 to give a thiatriazine of formula XI. This compound may be alkylated on the nitrogen atom in the 4 position using an alkylating agent, for example, an alkyl halide or alkyl sulphate, for example, methyl iodide, benzyl bromide or dimethyl sulphate. The alkylation of the amino group may be carried out in a known manner, for example, in the presence of a base, for example, sodium methoxide or di isopropylethylamine, in a solvent, for example, methanol or acetonitrile, and generally at a temperature within the range of 20 to 1000C. Certain thiatriazines of the general formula IV may be prepared as shown in Scheme II or Scheme III.

The trialkyl group is preferably a trimethyl group. This reaction may be carried out as described in Chem. Ber. 101 3185 1968 . Gyclisation of compound XIV to give the thiatriazine of formula XV may be carried out by reaction of compound XIV with thionyl chloride, thionylaniline or thionyldiimidazole. A compound XV may be used diretly in a condensation reaction with a compound of formula III to give a compound of formula I, or may first be oxidised to the corresponding 1,1 dioxide XVI, using an oxidising agent, for example, a peracid, for example, m chloroperbenzoic Åacid, hydrogen peroxide, an alkyl hydroperoxide, for example, t butyl hydroperoxide, or a permanganate, for example potassium permanganate. Scheme IIIEMI11.1 Sulphonyl di isocyanate XVII may be reacted with a primary amine of formula XVIII in which R3a is as defined above according to DE OS 2,337,867, to provide the thiatriazine of formula XIX. Conversion of this compound to the thiatriazineXX having leaving groups L and L2 at the 3 and 5 positions ie a compound of formula IV in which p 2 may be accomplished by a variety of methods, for example, by treatment with PCl5 or C0Cl2 DMF in a solvent, for example, POCl3, CC14 or ClCH2CH2Cl, zo give LÚ Lê Cl, or by treatment with phosphorus pentasulphide or p methoxyphenylthionophosphine sulphide dimer with subsequent alkylation to give L1 L2 alkylthio. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that it is possible to convert a thiatriazine intermediate of formula IV into a thiatriazine intermediate of formula II by, for example, reaction with a primary or secondary amine NHR5aR6a EMI12.1 Certain thiatriazines of general formula II may be prepared as shown in Scheme IV. Scheme IVEMI13.1 In the above reaction scheme, R3, R4 and L1 are as defined R12 represents an a above, and R12 represents an alkyl group, for example an alkyl group having up to 4 carbon atoms, especially a methyl group an aryl group, especially a phenyl group or an aralkyl group, especially a benzyl group. In compound XXVI, the two groups R12 may be the same or different. In compound XXI, R 12 is for example, a methyl group, and in compound XXVI, for example, one of the two groups R12 is a methyl group and the other is a phenyl group, or both are methyl groups, or both are phenyl groups. Ac.ylaminosulphonylchlorides of formula XXVII are known, see for example, R. Graf, German Specifications 931,225 and 931,467. Dithioiminocarbonates of formula XXVI are also known, see for example, Z. Chem. 8, 459 460 1968 . The term known t is used herein to mean in actual use in the art or described in the literature of the art. An N substituted isothiourea XXI may be reacted with an acylaminosulphonyl chloride XXVII in the presence of a base, for example, triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, in an aprotic solvent, for example, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, generally at a temperature within the range of from 20 to 30 C, to give the key intermediate of formula XXV reaction i . A compound of formula XXV may also be prepared from an isothiourea XXI by another route reactions ii and iii . First, the isothiourea XXI reacted with a carboxylic acid chloride XXII, in the presence of a base, for example, triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, in an aprotic solvent, for example, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, generally at temperature within the range offrom 50 to OOC, to give a mixture of isomers from which the predominant one, compound XXIII, can be separated by conventional means, for example, by fractional crystalli sation or by chromatography. Compound XXIII is then reacted with aminosulphonyl chloride XXIV under conditions analogous to those described above for reaction i . Migration of the acyl group results in the formation of compound XXV. Compound XXV may be prepared by a third method reactions iv and v , which comprises reacting a dithioiminocarbonate XXVI with an acylaminosulphonyl chloride XXVI I under conditions analogous to those described above for reaction i and then displacing an SR12 group from the resulting compound XXVIII with primary amine of formula XXIX. Heating a compound of formula XXV in an aprotic solvent, for example, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, xylene or ethylenegglycol dimethyl ether, generally at a temperature within the range of from 80 to 160 C, affords a thiatriazine of formula XXX. In some compounds of formula XXX,the group R12S is a suitable leaving group L1, ie such compounds fall within the general formula II, but in other compounds of formula XXX it is necessary or preferable to convert a goup R12S into a leaving group L1 that is more readily displaced by a nucleophile.Such a conversion may be carried out by known methods, for example, by oxidising the sulphide group R 2S to the corresponding sulphoxide group using, for example, a peracid, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid, hydrogen peroxide, or a periodate, perborate or permanganate salt or by replacing the sulphide group R12S by a halogen atom, for example, by treating compound XXX with excess chlorine in an inert solvent, for example, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate, generally at a temperature within the range of from 20 to 1000C, and preferably in the presence of a catalyst, for example, zinc chloride. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of the general formula I may exist as one or more tautomeric isomers, especially those structures where R3 represents a hydrogen atom and R4 represents a group NR5R6 in which R5 or R6 represents a hydrogen atom, for example, as shown below EMI16.1 This tautomerism may also occur when the thiatriazine ring is substituted by carbon substituents EMI16.2 All possible tautomeric forms of formula I are part of the present invention. It will also be appreciated that when p represents 1, the sulphur oxygen bond in formula I can exist in two stereoisomeric configurations R and S. All stereoisomers of formula I are also part of the present invention. Any reference to a compound of formula I herein includes all possible tautomeric and stereoisomeric forms of that compound. Moreover, all possible tautomeric and stereoisomeric forms of any other compound mentioned in the present specification are similarly included within the general references to that compound. As indicated above, the compounds of the present invention have histamine H 2 antagonist activity. Histamine H2 antagonists have been shown to inhibit gastric acid secretion in a variety of test animals and in man. These compounds are also capable of blocking the gastric secretion stimulated by exogenously administered histamine or pentagastrin seeBrimblecombe et al., J. Int. Med. Res. 3, 86 1975 . Compounds of this invention were tested for antisecretory activity in the perfused rat stomach. The method ofGosh and Schild, Brit. J. Pharmacol. 13, 54 1958 as modified by Lawrence and Smith, Europ. J. Pharmacol. 25, 389 1974 was used to prepare the test animals and acid secretion was stimulated by infusing either histamine or pentagastrin at a constant rate. After the secretion plateau was reached, the test compound was administered i.v. and the amount of comound required to inhibit the stimulated secretion by 50 was determined. The ID50 values for some of the compounds of this invention are given in the following Table. Two to four rats were used for each determination.EMI17.1 4 ID50 umoles kg Rat perfused stomach i.v.
