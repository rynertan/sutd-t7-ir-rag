## Description
Method for cc,ntinuously measuring the production of liquid from a liquid eas mixture and meter for carrying Ott said method. The present invention relates to a method for measuring the production of liquid from a streaming liquid gas mixture and, in particular, to the measurement of the quantity of milk received from an individual animal in a dairy. The present invention also relates to a meter that enables one to carry out such a method. Apparatus for the measurement of quantities of liquid, such as milk, are known. In general, modern milking machines consist of a vacuum pump installation, provided with a regulator, which supplies the necessary vacuum. A pulsator device alternates periods of suction and periods of rest. The actual milking apparatus is hung from the udder of the animal. The milk yielded by the animals is collected in a milk pipeline, to which several milking apparatus are coupled. This pipeline carries the air milk mixture to an air separator from which the milk is pumped to its specific storage or processing place. Individual meters enable one to verify the individual production of each animal milked and can serve as the means for automatically removing the milking apparatus from the udder when the milking is finished. Such meters consist of a receiver with a single or double chamber, whereby the quantity of milk is registered in a volumetric or dynamic way or by weighing. In order to obtain good quality milk, the apparatus must be provided with means which can be cleane d and disinfected thoroughly. Up to now these meters were complicatëd, rather expensive and often difficult to clean and to maintain. The objet of the invention is to provide a more simple method to measure the production of liquid from a liquid gas mixture by means of an apparatus that works economically and efficiently. According to the invention there is provided a method for continuously measuring the production of liquid from a streaming liquid gas mixture, which comprises separating liquid produced from the liquid gas mixture by projecting the liquid along the surface of a cylindrical receiver, while the gas from the mixture is sucked up into a tube like float, located internally and concentric to said cylindrical surface, said float moving up and down in accordance with the quantity of liquid which is drawn off at the bottom of the cylindrical receiver through an outlet funnel on which said float is supported. The oscillations of the float are representative of the quantity of liquid that streams through the meter and said fluctuations are transmitted to a counter which displays the liquid production in litres. The meter in accordance with the invention which enables one to carry out said method consists of a cylindrical hollow float which moves up and down in a float chamber consisting of a cylindrical jacket with a supply pipe mounted at the upper end of the cylindrical surface of said jacket an upper part provided at its bottom with a circular slot with an outer diameter smaller than the diameter of the cylindrical jacket and which is placed with its opening towards said cylindrical jacket at the level of the supply tube mounted in this jacket and a lower part provided with means to hold upright the float and with a conical outlet funnel at its bottom, and the hollow float consisting of a cylindrical tube provided at its upper end with holes and at its bottom with a conical funnel which is adapted to engage the outlet funnel of the float chamber in use. More specifically the invention provides a meter for continuousy measuring the production of liquid from a streaming liquid gas mixture, comprising a receiver and a hollow float which moves up and, down in said receiver, the receiver consisting of a cyXindrical jacket, an upper part and a lower part, and said float consisting of a tube provided with holes and a conical funnel, the cylindrical jacket being provided at its top with a supply tube which is mounted slantwise thereon, the upper part of the receiver being provided at its bottom with a circular slot with an outer diameter smaller than the diameter of the cylindrical jacket and which is placed with its opening towards said cylindrical jacket at the level of said supply tuSe, and the lower part of the receiver being provided with means to hold upright the float and with an outlet funnel with which the conical funnel of the float engages in use, whereby the upper part of the receiver and the top of the float are provided with re spe.c,tive. c9mponents 9f an oscilla tion meter which registers the fluctuations of the float in the receiver. Further features and advantages of the method and the meter in accordance with the invention will be evident from the description of a, milk meter in accordance with the invention and its working method with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a diagram of a milk installation wherein the milk meter is fitted Fig. 2 is a perspective view of the milk meter separated into its different components Fig. 3 is a cross section of the milk meter in accordance with the invention Fig. 4 is a cross section of the milk meter in accordance with the invention at the level of the washjunction and Fig. 5 is a longitudinal cross section, on which the cross sections of fig. 3 and 4 are marked, of the milk meter in accordance with the invention. As shown in fig. 1 the milk meter 2 in accordance with the invention is mounted between the milking apparatus 1 and the milk pipeline 3 . The conduit that comes from the milking apparatus 1 is connected to the milk supply tube 5 of the milk meter 2 . The milk pipeline 3 , which takes care of the vacuum supply as well as of the milk discharge is mounted on the milk outlet 6 of the milk meter 2 . Electric signals coming from the milk meter 2 in accordance with the quantity of milk produced are processed and displayed in the milk meter operating panel 4 with digital display. The milk meter 2 in accordance with the invention is constructed of materials which satisfy the norms set by the food industry. It is composed of different, detachable parts. The main elements of the milk meter 2 are a milk receiver and a float 8 figs. 2,3 and 5 . The milk receiver itself is composed of a transparent, cylindrical jacket 9 , provided at its upper end with a supply tube 5 , mounted slantwise on the jacket 9 , to which the conduit coming from the milk apparatus 1 is connected an upper part 20 and a lower part 21 . The upper part 20 is fixed airtight to the jacket 9 with a sealing ring 19 and is provided in the middle with a cylindrical cavity which acts as a stabilization chamber for the tube like float 8 during its up and down movement, and with a circular slot 15 at its bottom of which the opening passes along the cylindrical surface of the jacket 9 at the level of the supply tube 5 which is connected with a conduit coming from the milking apparatus. The upper part 20 is also provided with a wash junction 7 which leads tangentially into the stabi lization chamber for the tube like float 8 . Through this wash junction 7 water can be injected in order to clean the milk meter 2 . At 2ts top, the upper part 20 is provided with a centrally mounted component of an oscillation meter 14 which is connected with the milk meter operating panel 4 by a wire 22 . This component 14 is protected by a removable lid 13 fixed on the upper part 20 . The lower part 21 is fixed airtight to the jacket 9 with sealing ring 19 but can also form part of the jacket 9 . The The 1otwer e r part 21 is provided with me3ns to hold upright the tube like float 8 represented in figs. 2,3 and 5 n the form of two or more vertical pins 11 which are laced round an imaginary circle with a diameter equal to the inner diameter of the cylindrical stabilization chamber of the upper part 20 and a conical ouLlet iunnel 10 , with the milk outlet 6 connected with the milk pipeline 3 . Within the milk receiver of the milk meter 2 , in accordance sath t h the invention, a tube like float 8 , which narrows at its bottom into a conical funnel 18 with two successive angular points, is placed. The gradient of the cone of the out let funnel 10 is worked out in such a was that the funnel 18 touches the outlet funnel 10 with . truncated cone surface so that the outlet funnel 10 also frictions as a seat for the tube like float 8 , while the vertical pins 11 function as guides for the said float 8 when it floats up and down. On top of the tube like float 8 , holes 16 and 25 are provided, while in the middle of the upper surface the comp emflltary component 17 of the oscillation meter 14 of the upper part 20 is provided. The milk meter 29 in accordance with the invention operates as follows. The vacuum supplied by the milk installation and the pulsator device causes the flowing of the milk air mixture towards the supply tube 5 . The mixture flows tangentially via the circular bloL 15 into t e float chamber, as represented in f g. ,. this circular slot 15 has preferabley a hyperboic section. As the stream of milk is forced into a certain movement, the milk flows down along the inner surface of the jacket 9 and fills the receiver gradually, while the air is separated from the mixture and is sucked up through holes 16 and 25 of the tube like float 8 . In its starting position the tube like float 8 closes the milk outlet 6 of the receiver because it rests under the influence of its weight in the outletfunnel 10 and because the cone of the funnel 18 and the outlet funel 10 fit together perfectly. In this position there is a small distance between the upper surface of the tube like float 8 , with worked in complementary component 17 , and the oscillation meter component 14 in the upper part 20 of the receiver. But us the level of the milk in the floatchamber rises, t,e tube like float 8 begins to float under the influence of the upward pressure of the milk.By doing so the milk outlet 6 is opened. The milk flows through the milk outlet 6 via the milk pipeline 3 towards the milk reservoir not shown . As long as the milk flows off, the tube like float 8 bobs in its seat. The fluctuations of the float alter the distance between the oscillation meter components 14 and 17 constantly.When the funnel 18 rests again in the outlet funnel 10 the milking operation is finished. In said milk meter, this fluctuation causes variations in the electro magnetic field between the compo nexts 14 and 17 of the oscillation meter, which are translated in the milk meter operating panel 4 into decilitres of production. The measuring is carried out continuously during the milking of the animal concerned. After each milking operation the milk meter 2 should be cleaned. The wash junction 7 of the upper part 20 of the receiver is connected by a tube to a wash apparatus.The waLor eir Lcrs the recci er and disperses along the jacket 9 and Lhe outer and inner surface of the tube like float 8 through the vertical 16 and horizontal 25 holes provided in said float 8 . The vertical holes 16 are preferably cut out parallel and blade like, as shown in fig. 4. Under the pressure of the injected rinse water the tube like float 8 turns round its vertical axis and is held up straight by the upper part 20 and the vertical pins 11 of the lower part of the receiver. The turning of the tubelike float 8 eases the cleaning of the milk meter 2 .
