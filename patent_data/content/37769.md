# ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY AND METHOD FOR MAKING AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An electrical connector assembly 10 and method of making wherein the connector does not require a separate contact but comprises end strands 52 of a multi stranded electrical conductor wire 50 . The strands 52 are formed into a loop 56 having overlapping portions 57 and the overlap ping portions are secured together by a weld. The forward portion of the strands 52 are straightened into axial align ment and the ends 53 of each strand cut and provided with angled end surfaces 54 . The conductor wire so prepared is inserted into a molded housing 20 having two mating halves 30, 40 , at least one of which is provided with a channel 33 including a loop cavity 62 and a projection 60 . The loop 56 of the conductor is mounted over the projection and the two connector halves secured together to complete the connector assembly.
