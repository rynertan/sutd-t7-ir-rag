# Corrosion resistant steel components and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A non alloy steel component is nitrocarburized at 550 to 720 C for up to 4 hours in a nitriding gaseous atmosphere eg. ammonia or ammonia and endothermic or exothermic gas, and is thus exposed to an oxidising atmosphere for 2 to 120 seconds to form an oxide rich layer thereon before being quenched into an oil water emulsion, degreased and a tack free wax coating applied. Alternatively, the component may be cooled in an oxidising atmosphere and then wax coated or it may be cooled in a non oxidising atmosphere and then reheated to provide the oxide rich surface layer before being cooled again and wax coated. As a further alternative, the component may be cooled, lapped to a surface roughness of not more than 0.2 micrometres Ra, reheated to oxidise end then quenched. These techniques give a good corrosion resistance to the component.
