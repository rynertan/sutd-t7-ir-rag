# Hydraulic braking systems for tractor trailer combinations.

## Abstract
A hydraulic braking system for agricultural tractor trailer combinations, taking hydraulic power from a pump P on the tractor. The system includes a pressure control valve 1A movable by the main hydraulic service supply to connect the main supply with a chamber 3 in communication with a re stricted bore 4 and an outlet for the by passed braking fluid. A pilot valve 1B responsive to tractor braking pressure at E , or manually operable at F , admits fluid to the tailer brakes at B and operates a check valve 34, 35, 38, 39 closing a con nection between the chamber 3 and a return line 40 for fluid not required for braking. The return line 40 may be connected to a low pressure sink or to the flow at the services outlet port preferably via another check valve.
