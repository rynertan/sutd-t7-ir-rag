## Description
ADDUCTS FROM . MINES D DI L TD POLYEPOXIDES Adducts from amines and mono and diepoxides have long been used in industry as curing agents for epoxy resins. The advantages of the formation of such adducts include lower volatility, lower irritation potential, reduced tendency to blush and exude, and the like. Such adducts and the advantages thereof are discussed in Lee and Neville, Handbook of Epoxy Resins, McGraw Hill 1967 . It is to be noted, however, that these adducts do not exhibit significant improvement in chemical resistance over that of their free amine counterparts. More specifically, such adducts have been prepared from diethylenetriamine with diglycidylethers of bisphenol A of varying molecular weight. These epoxy resins have all exhibited a unctionality of not more than two and have exhibited various improved performance characteristics. As previously noted, however, they have been deficient in the important characteristic of resistance to chemical attack, and primarily to solvent attack. For example, U.S. 3,655,624, li.S. 3,704,281 and U.S.3,996,186 disclose adducts of triglycidyl isocyanurate and amines.These adducts are solid in form, are noted for use in molding materials and are generally inferior in terms of solvent resistance. Thus, these materials would have limited value as protective coatings. Additionally, U.S. 3,538,184, U.S. 3,625,918 and U.S.3,629,181 disclose amine adducts which are based on epoxy resins of the bisphenol A type or are alicyclic epoxy resins. While such adducts exhibit improved handling and mechanical properties, it is to be noted that the resins used therein have a functionality of not more than two and that the adducts are again deficient in the important characteristic of resistance to chemical attack. It is the primary object of this invention to prepare novel liquid adducts of amines and di and polyepoxides. It is a further object to provide adducts for use as curing agents for epoxy resins. It is still a further object to provide such curing agents which overcome the disadvantages of prior art curing agents when said curing agents are combined with a wide variety of epoxy resins. Further objects and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following descriptive material and illustrative examples. It has now been surprisingly discovered that the preparation of amine adduct curing agents utilizing epoxides of functionality greater than two dramatically enhances the chemical resistance properties of the cured epoxy products, particularly with regard to solvent resistance, over results obtained from either free amines or the conventional amine adducts. The improved performance characteristics are believed to result from the extremelyvdense cross link network obtained with the use of such polyepoxides. Thus, when the liquid amine adducts are utilized as curing agents with a wide variety of epoxy resins, the resulting cured products exhibit excellent resistance to attack by a wide variety of solvents, thereby assuring the applicability of these cures systems as, for example, protective coatings. As suitable amines component A , there may be mentioned aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic primary and secondary amines, with the aliphatic and cycloaliphatic amines being preferred.Typical amines include monoethanolamine, ethylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, trimethylhexamethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, N,N dimethyl propylenediamine 1,3, diethylpropylenediamine 1,3,bis 4 amino 3 methyl cyclohexyl methane, bis p aminocyclohexyl methane, 2,2bis 4 aminocyclohexyl propane, 3,5,5 trimethyl s aminomethyl cyclohexylamine, N aminoethyl piperazine, m phenylene diamine, p phenylenediamine, bis p aminophenyl methane, bis p aminophenyl sulfone, m xylylenediamine, 1,2 diaminocyclohexane, 1,4 diaminocyclohexane, 1,3 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane, 1 4 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane and isophorone diarnine. Preferred amines include diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, l,2 diaminocyclohexane, bis p aminocyclohexyl methane, m xylylenediamine, isophorone diamine, 1,4 bis aminomethyl cyclohexane, N aminoethyl piperazine, 1,3 bis artinomethyl cyclohexane and bis p aminophenyl methane. The multi functional resin of functionality greater than two may be selected from either, Component BEMI4.1 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, and n is 0.2 3.4. These components are exemplified by the epoxidation products of cresol novolacs and phenol novolacs of varying molecular weight. The preparation of such materials is well known in the art. Component C The glycidyl reaction products of excess amounts of epichlorohydrin with polyfunctional phenolic compounds,Typical conpounds falling within this category include triglycidyl paraaminophenol, tetraglycidyl 1,1,2,2 tetrakis p hydroxyphenyl ethane and triglycidyl ether of phloroglucinol. Although components B and C may be utilized as the sole polyepoxide reactant, they may also be blended with a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A Component D or a diglycidyl ether of hydrogenated bisphenol A the diglycidyl ether of 2,2 bis 4 cyclohexanol propane Component E or mixtures thereof to form the epoxy resin component. Etchers such as component D correspond to the formulaEMI5.1 wherein m is 0 2.2, while ethers such as component E correspond to the formulaEMI5.2 wherein n is 0 2.2. In addition to the above noted components, accelerators and solvents may be optionally present. The accelerators function to speed the curing operation in the preparation of thin films, i.e.films of a maximum of 8 mil thickness per coat. Typical accelerators include aromatic acids such as benzoic and salicylic acids phenols such as phenol, p tert.butyl phenol, bisphenol A and nonyl phenol and aromatic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol. The solvents modify the curable blends, particularly serving to control viscosity. Applicable solvents include ether alcohols such as ethylene glycol monomethylether, mono ethylether, monobutyletherr and the diethylene glycol analogs aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene and toluene and the like. The new adducts of this invention are generally prepared by charging the amine, and the solvent and accelerator if present, to the reaction vessel and heating to a temperature of 500 800C.The polyepoxide is then added over a period of from 60 to 180 minutes, allowing a maximum exotherm up to about 1250C. At the conclusion of the polyepoxide feed, the reaction mixture is generally heated to 500 to 1200C. to ensure completeness of the reaction.The progress of the reaction can be followed by titration of the epoxide groups using samples taken during the reaction, completion being indicated by the absence of epoxy groups. With regard to relative concentrations of the various components, the following tabulated figures apply. In all instances, the amine is used in excess amounts. 1 Two component reaction products Component A is utilized in amounts ranging from about 6 20 weight equivalents ofA per weight equivalent of component B or component C, and preferably 8 12 equivalents of A per equivalent of B or C. 2 Three component reaction products Component B or component C is utilized in amounts ranging from about 1 3 weight equivalents per weight equivalent of component D and or E, and preferably 1 equivalent of B or C per equivalent of D and or E.The ratio of A to the epoxy mixture B D E or C D E ranges from 6 20 weight equivalents of A per weight equivalent of mixture, and preferably 8 12 weight equivalents of A per weight equivalent of mixture. The accelerator and solvent may each be present in concentrations ranging from about 0 40 by eight of the total reaction product. The adducts of the instant invention are liquids at room temperature with medium viscosity. They are yellow in color. As previously noted, the adducts of this invention are useful as curing agents for a wide variety of epoxy resins in both room temperature and heat cured applications. When combined with di and polyepoxides, at generally stoichiometric amounts, and cured at room temperature or with mild heat about 65eC , a network of high crosslink density occurs. Accordingly, the expres sion cure as used herein, denotes the conversion of the above adducts and epoxide material into insoluble and infusible crosslinked products, with simultaneous shaping to give shaped articles such as castings, pressings or laminates, or to give two dimensional structures such as coatings, enamels or adhesive bonds. The adducts prepared according to the invention and admixed with other polyepoxide compounds can furthermore be mixed, at any stage before cure, with usual modifiers such as extenders, fillers and reinforcing agents, pigments, dyestuffs, organic solvents, plasticizers and the like. As extenders, reinforcing agents, fillers and pigments which can be employed in the curable mixtures according to the invention there may, for example, be mentioned coal tar, bitumen, glass fibers, boron fibers, carbon fibers, cellulose, polyethylene powder, polypropylene powder, mica, asbestos, quartz powder, gypsum, antimony trioxide, bentones, silica aerogel erosil , lithopone, barite, titanium dioxide, carbon black, graphite, iron oxide, or metal powders such as aluminum powder or iron powder.It is also possible to add other usual additives, for example, flameproofing agents, agents for conferring thixotropy, flow control agents such as silicones, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyvinyl butyral, waxes, stearates and the like which are in part also used as mold release agents to the curable mixtures. The curable mixtures can be manufactured in the usual manner with the aid of known mixing equipment stirrers, kneaders, rollers and the like . The curable epoxide resin mixtures are especially useful in the fields of surface protection, the electrical industry, laminating processes and the building industry. They can be used in a formulation which is in each case suited to the particular end use, in the unfilled or filled state, optionally in the form of solutions or emulsions, as paints, enamels, sintering powders, compression molding compositions, dipping resins, casting resins, injection molding formulations, impregnating resins and adhesives, as tooling resins, laminating resins, sealing and filling compositions, floor covering compositions and binders for mineral aggregates. Of primary interest is their utility as protective coatings. The coating composition may be applied to any suitable substrate by any suitable means such as spraying, dipping, brushing, painting or roller coating. After the desired film thickness is applied, curing proceeds either at room temperature or at elevated temperatures. The resultant cured coatings are void free and possess excellent physical properties and chemical resistance.The distinct advantage of these systems is exhibited in the latter area where excellent resistance to the adverse effects of acids, solvents, alcohols and alkaline materials are noted.Of particular value is the unexpected resistance of these materials to the adverse effects of solvents. Such resistance is essential when the epoxy coatings are utilized as tank linings or flooring materials. The following examples will further illustrate the embodiments of the instant invention. In these examples, all parts are given by weight unless otherwise noted.
