# SEALED BATTERY.

## Abstract
A sealed battery includes a plurality of flat unit cells each formed by sealing a group of plates into a jacket made of a synthetic resin film or sheet. The cells are stacked together in the direction of their thicknesses, and are housed in a casing under pressure. In this way, it is possible to increase the volume efficiency of the battery and apply a uniform pressure to the plurality of unit cells. It is also possible to eliminate variations in life among the cells, and obtain a battery with a reduced thickness which can be easily assembled and has a high degree of reliability. It is therefore possible to provide a battery which is suitable as a power source for a portable electric device.
