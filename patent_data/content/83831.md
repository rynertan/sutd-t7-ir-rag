## Description
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING SUlFURIC ACID AND AMMONIA The present invention relates to a process for producing sulfuric acid and ammonia. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the recovery of sulfuric acid and ammonia from diammonium sulfate and to the possible further commercial utilization thereof in a unitary continuous process.As is known, diammonium sulfate is obtained in large quantities as a by product of a number of manufacturing processes, e.g. in the manufacture of caprolactan, acrylic acid and similar products.Although diammonium sulfate is utilizable as a fertilizer, the disposal of diammonium sulfate produced as a byproduct of such manufacturing processes is difficult in many cases due to the distances between such manufacturing sites and the potential markets for such fertilizer material. As a result great efforts are expended on recycling diammonium sulfate by converting it to sulfuric acid and ammonia.Thus in Federal Republic of Germany OffenlegungsschriftNo. 2 130 036 diammonium sulfate is first heated to convert it to ammonium hydrogen sulfate and NR3 whereby half of the ammonia is recovered. Next the ammonium hydrogen sulfate is pyrolyzed with a hydrocarbon oil at 10400 whereby the remaining half of the NH3 is destroyed but the sulfur content is recovered in the form of SQ2 which can be reoxidized to sulfuric acid.The very complexity of the above prior art process serves in itself to illustrate and emphasize the fact that thermal dissociation of diammonium sulfate to NH3 and H2S04 is not readily achievable beyond the stage of production of ammonium hydrogen sulfate. Therefore the known prior art processes all have recourse to severe decomposition reactions whereby ammonium hydrogen sulfate is reduced to SO2 with the loss of 50 of the NH3 of the initial diammonium sulfate. This is clearly an onerous procedure.There is therefore a need for an effective process that recovers the totality of NH3 and of H2S04 without going through a reduction oxidation sequence in addition to providing a better solution to the disposal of by product diammonium sulfate.The present invention provides a process for the recovery of sulfuric acid and ammonia from diammoni1lm sulfate, comprising the steps of a heating diammonium sulfate to a temperature sufficient to effect the thermal decomposition of ammonium sulfate to ammonium hydrogen sulfate and ammonia b introducing the resulting ammonium hydrogen sulfate into a solution comprising about 10 to about 45 weight per cent HcO, about 41 to 74 weight per cent S04, about 0.1 to 0.7 weight per cent H and about 13.5 to 15.5 weight per cent N114 to form a charged brine c contacting the charged brine with a solvent which is substantially water immiscible and which extracts H2S04 preferentially over ammonium sulfates whereby 112504 is selectively extracted from the brine and ammonium sulfate solids having molar ratios of NH4 to S04 ranging from above 1 1 to about 2 1 crystallize out of solution and d extracting the solvent loaded with H2SO4 with water to obtain a solution of sulfuric acid.As will be realized the present invention provides a simple process for producing sulfuric acid and ammonia from diammonium sulfate and is readily amenable to continuous operation with the regeneration and recycling of the components of the process.Thus, in preferred embodiments of the present invention, the crystallized ammonium sulfate solids from the step c can be separated from the brine and recycled for thermal decomposition according to the step a , the brine remaining from the step c can be recycled for use in the step b , and the washed solvent remaining after the step d can be recycled for use in the step c . Trie first step a of the process of the present invention is knows and can be carried out in several ways known in the art. In addition to the above mentioned German specification, this step is specifically described inU.S. Patent No. 3 674 427 and in French PatentNo. 2 370 694 amongst others. In all cases gaseous NH3 and ammonium hydrogen sulfate are obtained at temperatures of about 2500 to about 4500, preferably at temperatures of about 3500 to 4500. In the second step b of the process of the present invention the liquid ammonium hydrogen sulfate is fed into a reactor containing a solution comprising H20, SQ4, H and NH4, preferably in amounts of about 10 to about 30 weight per cent H20, about 58 to 74 weight per cent S04, about 0.3 to 0.7 weight per cent H and about 14 to 15 weight per cent NH4.The iligh temperature of the liquid ammonium hydrogen sulfate leaving the thermal decomposition stage permits easy control of the temperature of the solution which is obtained which may lose heat in subsequent operations.The temperature of operation is not critical and can be selected within a broad range. Generally temperatures higher than 100C and lower than the boiling temperature of the brine 1100 1300 are practical, with temperatures of 700C to 11000 being generally preferred.Furthermore the temperature need not be kept constant and a decrease of temperature will take place on contact with the solvent of the step c . The solvent used for selectively extracting sulfuric acid can be any solvent for 112504 that is not water miscible and substantially does not extract ammonium sulfates. Alcohols, e.g. pentanol, and many other ox genated and non oxygenated solvents satisfy this requirement.Naturally in each case extraction conditions must be adjusted to stability requirements of the chosen solvent.The class of solvents described in U.S. Patent No.4 291 007 is particularly suitable for this purpose.Thus an especially preferred solvent system for use in the present process comprises i a strong organic acid, which acid is oil soluble and substantially water immiscible both in free and in salt form ii an oil soluble amine, which amine is substantially water immiscible both in free and in salt form and iii a carrier solvent for the organic acid and the amine, wherein the molar ratio of the organic acid to the amine is from about 1 4 to 4 1.The process of the present invention has many valuable commercial applications including those wherein the process can successfully and advantageously be incorporated as part of a broader unitary commercial process.To illustrate this there may be considered the manufacture of phosphoric acid by the so called wet process. For every ton of P205 recovered through the acidulation of phosphate rock by sulfuric acid some 4 tons of by product calcium sulfate generally gypsum must be disposed of.This is costly and presents serious environmental problems.Through the application of the present invention sulfuric acid may be recovered from the gypsum and recycled to phosphoric acid manufacture by a sequence of operations represented by the equations below CaSO4 2N113 CO2 H20 CaCO NE4 2S04 9 No4 2504 112504 2N113 These equations indicate that concurrently with sulfuric acid recovery calcium sulfate is converted into environmentally innocuous calcium carbonate the ammonia serves an auxiliary function only .Thus the present invention in one of its preferred aspects relates to a process wherein the diammonium sulfate, from which the ammonia and sulfuric acid are produced, is itself first produced by reacting by product calcium sulfate from phosphoric acid manufacture with ammonia and carbon dioxide to produce calcium carbonate and diammonium sulfate, whereafter following the process of the present invention the recovered sulfuric acid is used in a manufacturing process for phosphoric acid, which later process results in the production of the calcium sulfate by product, and the ammonia produced in the step a is recycled for reaction with the calcium sulfate by product.The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples. EXESi 264 Grams of solid diammonium sulfate were fed to a reactor maintained at a temperature of about 4000C in which thermal decomposition of the diammonium sulfate occurred producing 34 grams of gaseous ammonia and 230 grams of liquid ammonium hydrogen sulfate. The ammonia gas was vented and recovered and the liquid ammonium hydrogen sulfate was fed Into a second reactor containing a solution comprising about 10.5 weight per cent 1120, 73.7 weIght per cent S04, 0.7 weight per cent r , and 15.1 weight per cent WH4 to form a charged brine solution which was maintained at a temperature of about 80 C. The charged brine was then contacted with 12 liters of a solvent prepared by mixing methyl tricaprylyl ammonium chloride sold by Henkel as Aliquat 336 and dinonyl naphthalene sulfonic acid sold b Ring Industries asSynex DN 052 in aromatics free white spirit to give 0.25M concentration of each this solvent was washed with water in order to wash away the HCl prior to use .In the single liquid liquid contact, the solvent took up 98 grams of 112504 and, simultaneously, solids containing 132 grams of diammonium sulfate crystallized out in the aqueous phase. The loaded solvent was then separated from the aqueous slurry and was further extracted with water in four oounter current stages to obtain a 30 solution of 112504. EXAMPLE 2The aqueous slurry formed in Example 1 was separated by centrifugation or filtration to obtain a recycle brine and a wet cake containing 132 grams of diammonium sulfate. The wet cake was then mixed with 132 grams of solid diammonium sulfate for thermal decomposition as carried out in Example 1. The recycle brine obtained from the centrifugation or filtration was then recycled for combination with the ammonium hydrogen sulfate formed from the thermal decomposition as described in Example 1 to reform a charged brine.Furthermore, the solvent exiting from the counter current extraction of Example 1 was also recycled into the process described in Example 1 for recontacting with the charged brine.The net result was the decomposition of 132 grams of diammonium sulfate to 98 grams 112504 and 34 grams NH3 and the regeneration of brine, washed solvent and recycle diammonium sulfate, ready for reuse in a further identical cycle.Thus the present example also illustrates the amenability of the present process to continuous operation.As will be realized the above exemplified system is self correcting with respect to the quantities of 112504 and diammonium sulfate obtained in every cycle so that they tend to satisfy the equation 2N11411504 N114 2504 112504 If due to fluctaations in operating conditions more 112504 is extracted than the equivalent to the diammonium sulfate precipitated then the composition of the recycle brine will automasically adjust itself so that in the subsequent cycle relatively less H2S04 will be extracted until the ratio corrects itself.EXAMPLE 3This example illustrates the applicability of the present invention to the production of phosphoric acid from phosphoric rock.A sulfuric acid obtained in Example 2, 98 grams, was concentrated to 98 weight per cent and then used to attack 115 grams of Florida phosphate rock. The slurry thus obtained was filtered and washed. An aqueous phase containing 32 grams of P205 and a filter cake containing 135 grams of calcium sulfate were formed. This ce was reacted with terse 34 grams 0 m rlonia obtained in Example 2 and the requ ed C02 44 grams and water according to established industrial processes.A solid phase contairi iinz 100 grams of calcium carbonate and an aqueous phase containing 132 grams of diammonium sulfate were obtained. After phase separation the water from the aqueous phase was evaporated and 132 grams of diammonium sulfate crystallized. The solid was treated as in Example 2 and 98 grams of sulfuric acid and 34 grams of ammonia were recovered. In the overall process an aqueous phase containing 32 grams of P205 and a solid phase containing 100 grams of calcium carbonate were obtained from 115 grams of phosphate rock and 44 grams of C02 Thus, in effect, the net result consisted of the attack of phosphate rock by CO2 to obtain phosphoric acid and calcium carbonate.
