# Injection stretch blow molding machine.

## Abstract
An injection stretch blow molding machine for produc ing hollow articles such as bottles by simultaneously per forming the formation of a parison by injection molding and sharping of the parison by stretch blow molding. The machine has an injection mold constituted by a male mold part 10 and a female mold part 2 and a stretch blow mold constituted by a male mold part 12 and a female mold part 7 . The machine further has four neck molds capable of opening and closing to release and clamp the neck of the parison and arranged on a rotary body 14 at a 90 interval. The rotary body 14 is rotatable to bring the neck molds successively through an injection position 8a , heating position 8b , blow position 8c and a discharge position 8d which are arranged at a 90 interval. As the rotary body 14 makes the 90 intermittent rotation, the parison formed by injection in the injection position 8a is brought by the neck mold to the heating position 8b , and the preceding parison heated in the heating position 8c is conveyed by another neck mold to the blow position to be finished by stretch blow molding. At the same time, the finished article is conveyed by still another neck mold to the discharge position 8d where the neck mold is opened to release the finished article.
