# An air fuel induction system for spark ignition internal combustion engines, and electromagnetic valves.

## Abstract
A motor vehicle fuel system operable selectively to supply metered quantities of either petrol or LPG in its gaseous state to a carburetter induction passage 15 . The LPG system 18 includes a single stage pressure regulator and an injection valve 26 . The regulator operates to vary the pressure of gaseous LPG with variations in engine loading by referring that pressure across a single diaphragm to the pressure established in the induction passage 15 down stream of the throttle valve 16 by operation of the engine 100 , whilst maintaining that regulated pressure above that subsisting in the induction passage 15 upstream of the throttle valve 16 . An electronic control system 19 re sponds to certain engine operating conditions and controls operation of the inlection valve 26 whereby the latter injects metered quantities of gaseous LPG for presentation to the induction passage 15 upstream of the throttle valve 16 in accordance with the requirements of the engine 100 .
