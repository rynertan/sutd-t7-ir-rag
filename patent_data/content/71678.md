# Pipe coupling.

## Abstract
A coupling pipe 3 extends between pipe unions 1 and 2 of which the union 1 is conventional with a metal com pression ring 5 which binds on to the pipe end and a back nut 4. At the other end a plastics compression ring 7 is employed, which does not bind on to the pipe so that longi tudinal shifting is possible to accommodate variations in the union to union spacing. Moreover the union 2 is bored out to accommodate an overlength pipe 3 which ensures that the end of the pipe is fully within the compression ring 7 over a range of union to union spacings.
