# Maximum throughput duplexing system for xerographic machines.

## Abstract
First side copying is produced on a sequence of copy sheets A, B, C, D equivalent to the number required to fill a closed loop duplex path 40, 41, 42 that returns the sheets to the imaging station 21 . An identical number of second images are transferred to the opposite sides as they are reintroduced from the closed loop duplex path through the imaging station. The sheet reintroduction is timed so that the next image transfer cycle is used for the first reintroduced sheet. The copy sheets are passed through a fuser station 38, 39 either prior to exit from the machine or as an element of the closed loop duplex return path.
