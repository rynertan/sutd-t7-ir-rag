# ELECTRICAL INTERCONNECT SYSTEM, METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME AND MASS FLOW METER INCORPORATING SUCH SYSTEM

## Abstract
A corrosion resistance electrical interconnect system has a flexible circuit with buried conductor patterns in an insulative film coating which is juxtaposed to a feed through connector having inlet outlet electrical contact pins therethrough. Sharp ends are present on the pins which pierce the insulative film and permit spot welding of the pin tips to portions of the conductor patterns. Other portions of the conductor patterns extend exteriorly of the flexible circuit and are electrically connected on to bond pads of an integrated circuit chip such as a sensor chip utilized in a mass flow meter.
