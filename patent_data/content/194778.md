## Description
This invention relates generally to a selective photoresponsive sensing circuit and, more particularly, to a multi photosensor arrangement for providing an exposure influencing control signal in a photographic camera apparatus. Various types of single cell and multicell photosensor arrangements for photographic cameras have been developed to measure the light reflected from a scene to be photographed and provide an exposure influencing control signal which may operate to control such exposure influencing events as the duration of the film exposure interval or the flash fire time and duration for a quench strobe. The simplest photosensors for cameras generally include a single photoresponsive cell that has a field of view approximately the same as that of the camera. Various types of multicell photometers have been developed in an effort to increase the accuracy of the film exposure interval determination over a wide range of differing scene illumination conditions. In some of these multicell photometers, the individual cells are arranged in an ordered array of rows and columns occupying an overall field of view equivalent to that of the camera. The output signals from the individual photosensors are utilized to determine an exposure interval in accordance with some selected algorithms. Difficulty may arise when there is extreme intensity of illumination over a small area of the scene, since such extreme intensity may have an inordinate effect on the calculated exposure interval. DE A 3007575 describes a multi metering device to generate an exposure influencing signal in response to photoelectric outputs received from a plurality of areas. A photoresponsor arrangement according to one aspect of the present invention, for providing an exposure influencing signal in a photographic apparatus, comprises a plurality of photoresponsive elements each arranged to have a different field of view and each providing an output signal corresponding to the scene light intensity detected by that photoresponsive element from its said field of view, and signal generating means for generating an exposure influencing signal in response to the output signals of the photoresponsive elements, and means controlling the transmission of the output signals from the photoresponsive elements to the signal generating means characterized in that the controlling means prevent the transmission to and use by the signal generating means of the output signal or signals from the photoresponsive element or elements detecting the highest and or lowest scene light intensity, whereby at least one output signal is transmitted to the signal generating means which provides the exposure influencing signal. With such arrangements, an extremely bright spot occupying a relatively small area of the scene, such as a small bright lamp in the foreground portion of an interior scene or the sun in an outdoor scene, is prevented from causing the exposure interval to be shorter than would otherwise be required to provide a full exposure of the major portion of the scene, excluding the bright spot. Conversely, a dark spot occupying a relatively small area of the scene such as may result from a small, highly non reflective object in the scene is prevented from causing a longer exposure interval than would otherwise be necessary to adequately expose the major portion of the scene excluding the said object. Advantageously, the multi processor arrangement embodying the invention provides an exposure influencing signal which is based on an average of the intermediate values of the scene light intensity sensed by the individual photosensors, regardless of the highest and lowest values of sensed scene light intensity. Preferably, the arrangement includes a circuit which operates resistively to bias the photoresponsive elements and in this manner to provide an output signal for each photoresponsive element corresponding to the scene light intensity detected by that photoresponsive element from its field of view. The circuit also provides a first control signal corresponding to the lowest scene light intensity detected by the photoresponsive elements and a second control signal corresponding to the highest scene light intensity detected by the photoresponsive elements. The circuit includes a gate control which responds to the output signals of the photoresponsive elements and to the first and second control signals to transmit the output signals of all the photoresponsive elements except the output signals of those selected photoresponsive elements which detect the highest and lowest scene light intensities. In order that the invention may be better understood, one example of a photosensor arrangement embodying the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Referring to Figure 1, there is shown the multiphotosensor arrangement of this invention comprising a plurality of photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄ each arranged to have a different selected field of view. Such fields of view need not be mutually exclusive and may in fact include overlapping areas of the scene to be photographed. Each of the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄ is preferably of the photoresistive type having positive terminals connected to a positive DC source V₁ by resistor elements R₁ through R₄, respectively, and negative terminals connected to the ground by resistor elements R₅ through R₈ respectively. The positive terminals of the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄ connect, respectively, to the anode terminals of diodes D₁ through D₄, and the cathode terminals of the diodes D₁ through D₄ are in common connection with respect to each other. In like manner, the negative terminals of the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄ connect, respectively, to the anode terminals of diodes D₅ through D₈, and the cathode terminals of the diodes D₅ through D₈ are in common connection with respect to each other. The cathodes of the diodes D₁ through D₄, in turn, connect by way of a resistor divider network comprising resistors R₉ and R₁₀ to the input terminals of a plurality of differential amplifiers or comparators A₁ through A₄. The other input terminals to the comparators A₁ through A₄ connect, respectively, to output terminals A through D from respective photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄. The cathode terminals of the diodes D₅ through D₈, in turn, connect by way of a resistor divider network comprising resistors R₁₁ and R₁₂ to the input terminals of another plurality of comparators or differential amplifiers A₅ through A₈. The other input terminals to the comparators A₅ through A₈ connect, respectively, to the output terminals A through D from respective photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄. The output signals G Operation of the photosensor arrangement of this invention proceeds in the following manner. The photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄ detect scene light from their respective fields of view and respond accordingly by providing a decreasing resistance in correspondence with the increasing intensity of the detected scene light. The photoresponsive element that detects the lowest scene light intensity which for purposes of illustration will be considered to be photoresponsive element P₁ also displays the highest resistance thereby forwardly biasing diode D₁ while the remaining diodes D₂ through D₄ remain reverse biased. Thus, there is provided a current flow through the diode D₁ and resistor R₉ corresponding to the minimum scene light intensity detected by all of the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄. Assuming for purposes of illustration that photoresponsive element P₄ detects the highest scene light intensity of all the photoresponsive elements, it will then display the lowest resistance so as to forwardly bias diode D₈, simultaneously reverse biasing the remaining diodes D₅ through D₇. Thus, there is provided a current flow by way of the diode D₈, resistor R₁₁ indicative of the maximum scene light intensity detected by the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄. The current flow from the resistor R₉ indicative of the minimum scene light intensity detected by the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄ is directed to respective input terminals of the comparators A₁ through A₄ to establish a comparator reference voltage. The other input terminals to the comparators A₁ through A₄ connect, respectively, to the output terminals A, B, C, and D from the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄. As is now readily apparent, the output signals from the terminals B, C and D which correspond to the scene light intensity detected, respectively, by the photoresponsive elements P₂, P₃ and P₄ exceed the reference voltage to the comparators A₂, A₃ and A₄ established by the current flow from the forwardly biased diode D₁ and resistor R₉ so as to switch the outputs from the comparators A₂, A₃ and A₄ to provide affirmative gate enabling signals at terminals G In like manner, the current flow through the forwardly biased diode D₈ and resistor R₁₁ corresponding to the maximum scene light intensity detected by the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄ is directed to respective input terminals of comparators A₅ through A₈. The reference voltage inputs to the comparators A₅ through A₈ are established, respectively, by the output signals from the terminals A, B, C and D corresponding, respectively, to the scene light intensities detected by the photoresponsive elements P₁ through P₄. As is now readily apparent, the output signals from the terminals A, B and C which determine the reference voltage levels for the comparators A₅, A₆ and A₇, respectively, are exceeded by the input voltage levels as determined by the current flow from the forwardly biased diode D₈ and resistor R₁₁ corresponding to the maximum scene light intensity so detected. Thus, the comparators A₅, A₆ and A₇ switch to provide affirmative gate enabling signals at the output terminals L As previously discussed, the gate control signals G Thus, the output signal from the terminal A corresponding to the scene light intensity detected by the photoresponsive element P₁ is transmitted through the gate 10 by virtue of the gate enabling signal provided from the terminal L Such exposure influencing events, as previously discussed, may include the timing of the exposure interval to close a shutter blade mechanism, the timing of the firing of a flash or a flash quench signal, or the preexposure detection of ambient scene light to determine whether the camera should be operated in a high or low ambient scene Light mode. Thus, in this manner the undue influence of inordinately high intensity localized ambient scene light as may result from a bright source of light occupying a relatively small area of the scene such as a small but bright lamp in the foreground portion of an interior scene or the sun in an exterior scene can be minimized since the output signal from that photoresponsive element which detects the bright spot of light is inhibited. Conversely, the effects from an inordinately low intensity portion of the scene which may be attributable to a dark shadow or a highly non reflective small spot in the scene may be minimized by inhibiting the transmission of the output signal from that photoresponsive element which detects the dark spot. Therefore, an averaged output signal is provided which more typically represents the overall scene light intensity regardless of local bright or dark spots in the scene light that could unduly influence the overall exposure. It will be readily understood that although four photoresponsive elements have been shown and described, the invention is by no means so limited and more or less photoresponsive elements may be utilized. For small numbers of photoresponsive elements, however, such as the four elements shown, it is preferred that additional means as are well known in the art be provided to properly scale the average exposure influencing control signal. In addition, conventional means may be provided to ensure that at least one output signal from the terminals A, B, C and D is gated through. Such means may include a latching circuit that counts the number of non enabling gate control signals to ensure that at least two gate enabling signals are provided to two serially connected gates. In addition, instead of inhibiting the transmission from the photoresponsive elements that detect the highest and lowest intensity of scene light it would also be well within the scope of the invention as claimed to inhibit the transmission of signals from those photoresponsive elements that detect scene light above a selected level and below a selected level. Toward this end, the trigger levels on the comparators A₁ through A₈ could be adjusted in a well known manner to determine selected ranges within which the scene light must be detected in order to qualify for transmission to the exposure control. In addition,it would also be apparent that the transmission of signals from the photoresponsive elements which detect the highest scene light intensities can be inhibited without inhibiting the transmission of signals from the photoresponsive elements which detect the lowest scene light intensities. Conversely, it would be equally apparent that the transmission of signals from the photoresponsive elements which detect the lowest scene light intensities can also be inhibited without inhibiting the transmission of signals from the photoresponsive elements which detect the highest scene light intensities.
