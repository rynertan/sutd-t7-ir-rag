# Apparatus and method for temperature control of chill water and steam in heating, ventilating, air conditioning HVAC systems.

## Abstract
In an HVAC network having a common thermal source 12 for providing thermal fluid to one or more HVAC systems 18, 19, 20 in the network which control the volume of thermal fluid circulating therethrough in dependence on the thermal energy demand from temperature regulated living spaces 46, 48 associated with each through position modulation of an associated fluid valve apparatus 34, 36 from a full closed position for a minimum volume to a full open position for maximum volume, electronic processing means 26 is provided in combination with dedicated sensing apparatus 86 for sensing the actual position of each fluid valve apparatus and the actual source discharge temperature 118, 120 , the electronic processing means 26 providing a determination of the magnitude of the greatest thermal energy demand within a short term interval in dependence on the most open of the actual valve position signals, and for further providing modulation of the source discharge temperature over the short term interval in dependence on the magnitude of the greatest thermal energy demand.
