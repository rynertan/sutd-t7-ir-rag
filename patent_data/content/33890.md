## Description
Power source apparatus for an electric flash lamp The present invention relates to a power source apparatus for an electric flash lamp. As well known, the power source apparatus for an electric flash lamp is generally of the type using a boosting transformer having a main capacitor connected to the secondary winding thereof. In this type of the power source apparatus, since a charge current flowing at the start of charging the main capacitor with a large capacity is large, the boosting transformer must be of the type of high load and high voltage withstanding, resulting necessarily in large size and heavy weight of the power source apparatus. Therefore, the prior power source apparatus using the boosting transformer has a problem that it is large in size and heavy in weight. To cope with the problem, there has been proposed another power source apparatus which employs a voltage multiplying circuit containing capacitors and diodes for charging the main capacitor, in place of the boosting transformer. This proposal is disclosed in a Japanese laid open patent publication No. 101318 79 or a Japanese laid open utility model publication No. 8635 79, for example. Although the power source apparatus of this proposal can solve the above mentioned problem, it has the following defects. In the power source apparatus, in order to reduce the charge time of the main capacitor, a charging resistor must be made small. If so done, it is difficult to limit a surge current at the time of charging. Further, the load for the charging circuit increases and a voltage drop along the power source line is remarkable.In this case, when the power source line has another circuit connected thereto, the another circuit may be adversely influenced. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a small and light power source apparatus for an electric flash lamp which can less the load for the charging circuit with a limited surge current at the time of charging and therefore can minimize the voltage drop along the power source line. According to the present invention, there is provided a power source apparatus for an electric flash lamp comprising a main capacitor for supplying discharge current to the flash lamp means for rectifying voltage supplied from an AC power source and multiplying the rectified voltage, the multiplied voltage being applied to the main capacitor switching means having a gate and connected between the voltage multiplying means and the AC power source and means for gradually lengthening a conductive period of the switching means by energizing the switching means at successively shortening periods of time. The present invention will better be understood when carefully reading the following description in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram of a power source apparatus for an electric flash lamp which is an embodiment according to the present invention and Fig. 2 is a time varying waveform of current supplied to a triac at the initial stage of charge, in which hatched portions are currents flowing through the triac. In Fig. 1 illustrating a circuit diagram of a power source apparatus for an electric flash lamp according to the present invention, the power source apparatus is comprised of a charge circuit 4 for charging a main capacitor 2, a soft start circuit 6 for minimizing the load for the charging circuit 4 by restricting the surge current flowing into the charging circuit 4 at the time of charging, and a voltage detecting circuit 8 which detects a charge voltage across the main capacitor 2 and deenergizes the soft start circuit 6 when the charging voltage reaches a predetermined voltage. In the charging circuit 4, an electric flash lamp 10 is connected in parallel with the charging capacitor 2, as shown, to form a discharge path. For simplicity of illustration, a trigger circuit for triggering the electric flash lamp 10 is omitted. In the charge circuit 4, a power source switch 14 connected to an AC power source 12 is connected in series to a charge register 16 and a triac 18 which controls the AC power supplied. The triac 18 is connected to a voltage multiplying circuit which is a voltage tripler circuit in the present embodiment.Connected between the triac 18 and the plus end of the capacitor 2 is a series circuit including first, second and third diodes 20, 22 and 24 which are arranged forwardly. A first capacitor 26 is connected between the cathode of the first diode 20 and the minus end of the main capacitor 2 connected to the AC power source 12. A second capacitor 27 is inserted between the anode of the first diode 20 and the cathode of the second diode 22. In the present embodiment according to the invention, the secondary winding of a pulse transformer 28 provided in the soft start circuit 6 for controlling a conductive angle of the triac 18 is connected between the gate of the triac 18 and the anode of the first diode 20.The plus end of the charging capacitor 2 is electrically connected through a voltage detecting line 32 to a comparator 30 provided in the voltage detecting circuit 8 for detecting the charging voltage across the capacitor 2. In the soft start circuit 6, input terminals of a diode bridge or a full wave rectifying circuit 34 are connected to the AC power source 12 and its output terminals are connected to a Zener diode 38 for constant voltage via a resistor 36. The Zener diode 38 is connected in parallel with a series circuit containing a diode 40 and a resistor 42. The resistor 42 is connected in parallel with a series circuit containing a resistor 44 and a first capacitor 46 charged through the resistor 44 and the diode 40. The capacitor 46 is connected across a series circuit which contains a variable resistor 48 and a second capacitor 50 charged through a path having the diode 40, the resistor 44 and the variable resistor 48. The plus end of the second capacitor 50 is connected to the emitter of a unijunction transistor UJT 52.Incidently, the UJT 52 may be substituted by a programmable unijunction transistor PUT . The first base of the UJT 52 is connected to the anode of the Zener diode 38 through the primary winding of the pulse transformer 28, while thetsecond base is connected to the cathode of the Zener diode 38 by way of a resistor 54. First and second photo transistors 65 and 58 of photo couplers are coupled in parallel with the first and second capacitors 46 and 50, respectively, in order to discharge the capacitors 46 and 50 when the charge capacitor 2 in the charging circuit 4 reaches a predetermined voltage. In the voltage detecting circuit 8, the AC power source 12 is connected in parallel with a Zener diode 64 for providing a constant voltage through the power source switch 14, a diode 60 and a resister 62. TheZener diode 64 connected across a capacitor 66. TheZener diode 64 also is coupled in parallel with a series circuit having first and second light emitting diodes 68 and 70 of the photo couplers. The series circuit of the photo diodes is connected across a collector emitter path of a transistor 72. The base of the transistor 72 is connected to the output terminal of the comparator 30 for energizing the transistor 72.The plus input terminal of the comparator 30 is connected to a junction point between a resistor 76 and a Zener diode 78, which form a series circuit connected in parallel with theZener diode 64, for suppling a referance voltage to the comparator 30. The minus input terminal of the comparator 30 is connected to a resistor 74 connected to a voltage detecting line 32 and to the anode of the Zener diode 64 through a resistor 79. With the above mentioned construction, the power source apparatus for the electric flash lamp according to the invention will operate in the following manner. When the power source switch 14 is turned on, electric power is supplied from the AC power source 12 to the charge circuit 4, the soft start circuit 6 and the voltage detecting circuit 8. Since no triggering voltage is applied to the gate of the triac 18 at the time of turning on the power source switch 14, the triac 18 is in OFF condition and therefore no charge current is supplied to the charge capacitor 2 of the charge circuit 4. Although the power is supplied to the soft start circuit 6, the UJT 52 is not immediately turned on. Therefore, no output pulse to be supplied to the gate of the triac 18 is developed in the secondary winding of the pulse transformer 18. The voltage supplied from the power source is full wave rectified by the diode bridge 43 and is clipped by the Zener diode 38 at about 24 V, for example.The clipped voltage is applied through the resistor 54 to the UJT 52. However, the charging voltage of the capacitor 50 is low at the start of charging. Therefore the UJT 52 remains OFF.Upon the turning on of the power source switch 14, the charging to the first capacitor 46 starts through the diode 40 and the resistor 44 and the charge to the second capacitor 50 starts through the variable resistor 48. Until the first half cycle of the full wave rectified voltage from the diode bridge 34 is terminated, the second capacitor 50 is charged to a predetermined voltage so that the UJT 52 is temporarily turned on.Therefore, the charge in the second capacitor 50 is discharged through the emitter base path of the UJT 52 and the primary winding of the pulse transformer 28. As a result, an output trigenning pulse is produced in the secondary winding of the pulse transformer 28 and the triac 18 is temporarily turned on, so that the charge current as designated by reference numeral 80 in Fig. 2 is supplied to the man capacitor 2 through the voltage multiplying circuit. In the next half cycle of the full wave rectified voltage, the second capacitor 50 is charged again through the combination of the diode 40, the resistor 44 and the variable resistor 48, while at the same time a chargeing current is supplied from the first capacitor 46 through the variable resistor 48 to the second capacitor 44.Therefore, the second capacitor 44 is charged to the predetermined voltage faster than in the first half cycle. As a result, the UJT 52 is kept ON for a longer period of time in the second half cycle and the charge current as indicated by numeral 82 in Fig. 2 is supplied to the charge circuit 4. In the succeeding cycle of the current, the charge voltage across the first capacitor 46 gradually grows and the charging time of the second capacitor 50 shortens. As a result, the UJT 52 oscillates earlier.The earlier oscillation makes advance the phase at which the triac 18 is triggered, so that the triac 18 is energized at successively shortening time intervals.The ON state duration in each half cycle gradually elongates as indicated by numerals 84 to 90 in Fig. 2 and finally the stationary charge current is supplied to the main capacitor 2. As seen from the foregoing description, at the initial stage of charging, the conductive angle of the triac 18 is restricted. Because of this, it is possible to restrict the surge current from possibly flowing into the charge circuit 4. In the above mentioned charging process, when the charge voltage for the main capacitor 2 is boosted to the predetermined voltage, for example 330 V, the voltage detecting circuit 8 operates to denergize the soft start circuit 6. That is, the plus input terminal of the comparator 30 is kept at the reference potential by the Zener diode 78 and the resistor 76, while the minus input terminal is kept at the voltage which is in propotion to the voltage charged to the main capacitor 2.When the voltage across the capacitor 2 fails to reach the predetermined voltage at the time of charging, the voltage at the minus terminal of the comparator 30 is lower than that at the plus input terminal. Accordingly, the potential at the output terminal of the comparator 30 is kept at high level and the transistor 72 is left in ON state. Under this condition, the rectifying current supplied to the series circuit of the first and second light emitting diodes 68 and 70 is bypassed by the transistor 72, so that these diodes 68 and 70 are kept deenergized. On the other hand, when the charge voltage across the main capacitor 2 reaches the predetermined voltage, the voltage at the minus input terminal of the comparator 30 is higher than the reference voltage at the plus input terminal, so that the level of the output voltage shifts to a low level.Therefore, the transistor 72 is turned off, so that the current is fed to the first and second light emitting diodes 68 and 70 and the phototransistors 56 and 58 are turned on. As a result, the first and second capacitors 46 and 50 are shorted by the phototransistors 56 and 58, respectively, to fully discharge the capacitors 56 and 58. Since this condition is continued so long as the charge voltage across the main capacitor 2 is not dropped, the UJT 52 will not oscillate and therefore the triac 18 is also kept OFF. As a result, the charge current is supplied to the charge circuit 4. As described above, since the power source apparatus according to the present invention does not include the boosting transformer, it is possible to make down the size and the weight of the power source apparatus.Additionally, since the surge current at the initial stage of the charging process is limited, the load for the charging circuit may be reduced and the voltage drop along the power source line may be prevented. As a consequence, it is possible to prevent the voltage drop from adversely influencing the related circuits.
