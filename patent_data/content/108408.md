# Temperature compensating voltage generator circuit.

## Abstract
A temperature compensating voltage generator circuit for compensating temperature characteristics of an electric circuit whose electrical characteristic varies in accordance with the change of the ambient temperature and whose electrical characteristic can be changed or controlled by a control voltage, the temperature compensating voltage generator circuit comprising a plurality of temperature senstive resistor circuits, a plurality of diode circuits and one or more resistor circuits, a temperature compensating voltage from the temperature compensating voltage gener ator circuit being independently adjustable at each predeter mined temperature.
