# Deglitching network for digital logic circuits.

## Abstract
A deglitching network for digital logic circuits includes a voltage actuated current source coupled to a linear track ing, constant voltage column clamp circuit. The deglitching network threshold level tracks closely with the predeter mined voltage of the column clamp, which also acts as a current sink. When heavy current loads are switched from the column clamp and its voltage falls briefly, the deglitching network is actuated to inject current into the column clamp circuit and restore the preset voltage.
