# Power transmission.

## Abstract
A power servo system which includes an actuator 12 coupled to a load and receives an input command signal R indicative of desired motion at the load. A sample data control system 20 receives and samples input signals R, Y indica tive of desired and actual motion at the hydraulic actuator and load, and provides drive signals U Z to the actuator neces sary to obtain desired motion. The sampled data control sys tem 20 includes digital processing circuitry 22 with series and feedback compensation 32, 28 , coordinated with the hydraulic system transfer function, to form a complete closed loop control system operating in the sampled data or Z transform domain. Different equation constants C₁, C₂, C₃ and G₁, G₂, G₃ in the series and feedback compensation circuitry are recalculated periodically. In one embodiment of the invention Figure 3 , such constants are recalculated as a function of system behavior, so that system control automa tically varies with operating conditions. In other embodi ments of the invention Figures 4 and 5 , system constants are calculated based upon a single operator variable or remote system input α , which accommodates rapid operator implemented tracking of system behavior while reducing cal culation time.
