# Method of projecting circuit patterns.

## Abstract
A method of exposure used to form circuit patterns of a circuit chip of, for example, a magnetic bubble memory device or a semiconductor IC device whose circuit patterns are composed of a plurality of partially different circuit patterns. In this method, a plurality of projections of a single reticle is effected on a substrate as the substrate is moved by predetermined pitch lengths, and it is possible to form alternate circuit patterns which differ slightly, by arranging small external areas 45, 46 of the pattern to overlap with corresponding areas 43,42 within the main circuit pattern 44 by successive exposures with the same reticle but with alternating pitches of slightly different values.
