# HIGH GAIN THYRISTOR SWITCHING CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A three terminal power switch utilizing a lateral thyris tor switching circuit is disclosed which exhibits very high gain for both turn on and turn off. The gate turn off capabil ity of the lateral thyristor 10 is accomplished utilizing a secondary shunting thyristor 11 to pull current out of the gate in response to the turn off signal. The output thyristor 10 is designed to maximize its turn off gain, and the drive thyristor 11 is designed for optimum forward conduction characteristics the output thyristor 10 carries approxi mately ten times the current of the drive thyristor 11 , in one embodiment.
