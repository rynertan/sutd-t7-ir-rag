## Description
SIMPLIFIED POWER SOURCE FOR FLUORESCENT LAMPS The present invention relates to a simplified power source for fluorescent lamps and the like. The usual fluorescent lamp circuit comprises a ballast circuit and a starter circuit to start and drive the fluorescent lamp for its illumination. Mr John T, Pierce disclosed a Power source for fluorescent lamps and the like patented on June 10, 1975 U.S. Patent No. 3,889,153 to have improved light output, lower power consumption and high reliability for fluorescent lamps. However, the lamps are independently operated from the oscillator circuit so that several capacitors are provided to couple the electric energy from the oscillating power source with the lamps. Hence, several defects are found as follows 1. Several windings of the transformer must be provided to induct voltage to pre heat the lamp filaments to cause dissipation of electric energy.2. Whenever removing either lamp from the circuit, an open circuit will occur so that the voltage across the transformer primary winding will be increased during the transistor turn off portion of the inverter cycle. The increased voltage may cause over heating of the transistors or serious damage to the capacitors. Hence, a unique protective circuit must be further provided to increase the product cost.3. As high voltage oscillation, the high tension will still exist on both sides of lamp sockets to cause danger when removing the lamp tube.4. The oscillator circuit is independently separated with lamps so that it will consume energy in despite of the connection or disconnection of fluorescent lamps. The object of the present invention is to provide a power source wherein the filaments of fluorescent lamps are connected in series with the transformer winding so that the primary winding of the transformer will be connected to the power source and oscillator circuit by means of the filaments and wherein the transformer winding itself will serve as an element of the oscillator circuit so as to simplify the whole circuit for lower construction cost and lower power consumption as well as to enhance safety because the circuit will be opened to stop oscillation and to prevent from occurring of high voltage when any lamp is removed from the circuit. The present invention can be clearly understood by the accompanying drawings, in which. Figure 1 is a circuit diagram of power source for two fluorescent lamps in accordance with the present invention and Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of power source for a single fluorescent lamp of the present invention. The attached drawings show the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The power source circuit as shown in Figure 1 comprises a high frequency transformer TR which is composed of three windings, N1, N1A and N2. Primary winding N1 of transformer TR is also an oscillating winding in that one end thereof is connected through contact 5, filament F1 of a fluorescent lamp L1 and contact 6 to the collector of transistor Q of an oscillator circuit and in that another end thereof is connected through contact 11, filamentF4 of a fluorescent lamp L2 and contact 12 tothe positive electrode 4 of the power source, Two ends of the winding N1A are respectively connected to filaments F2 and F3 which are connected in parallel through contacts 7, 8, 9 and 10 in order to facilitate the heating of said two filaments F2 and F3. Feed back winding N2 is connected at one end to the positive electrode 4 of power source and connected at another end to the base of transistor Q through resistor R3 and capacitor C2 which are connected in parallel. Associated with the transistor Q are resistor R1, which is connected between the base and the emitter, and a capacitor C1 which is connected between the collector and the emitter of the transistor Q. The emitter is connected to negative electrode 3 through a resistor R2. The terminals 1, 2 are fed with alternating current at, for example, 115 volts. The input current is rectified by rectifier RF and then smoothed by capacitor C3 to provide direct voltage across a resistor R4 which has terminals 3, 4. When the circuit is supplied with power, the base of said transistor Q will receive a positive bias to increase the current between the collector and the emitter thereof. The current passing through the filaments to primary winding N1 of transformer TR will be increased. However, the polarity of said feed back winding N2 is such that the winding provides negative feed back so as to choke the increasing current. The transistor constitutes a transformer coupled blocking oscillator, which oscillates at a frequency which is more than 20 KHZ. A high voltage is rapidly developed across the winding N1 the filaments of L1 and L2 will accept the current supplied from N1 to heat the lamp tubes for rapid starting. The voltage across the winding N1 will instantly light up the lamps. When removing either lamp from such a circuit, the oscillatory loop which includes the winding N1 will be opened and the high voltage across the windingN1 will be eliminated. In the modification shown in Figure 2 a single lamp 6 takes the place of the two lamps shown in Figure 1 the filament winding N1A and filaments F2, F3 will then be omitted. The present invention has the following advantages over the circuit shown in Pierce s patent 1. The filaments of the lamp or lamps constitute a current path which can be directly pre heated so that the complex pre heating winding and starting circuit of Pierce s patent can thus be simplified.2. The filaments also constitute a current path of said oscillator circuit so that the circuit will be opened when any lamp is removed therefrom thus open circuit protection is provided. 3. The filaments are connected in series with said primary winding N1 so as to avoid any coupling means or components between the transformer winding and the lamps. Therefore, the present invention has advantages of simpler construction, lower production cost, less maintenance, lower power consumption and greater safety than the circuit shown in Pierce s patent. The lamps connected in the circuit may be further modified to three sets or more in accordance with the present invention. The present.invention may be supplied with input voltage ranging from 6V to 300V by modifying the design data of the related components, such as capacitance, resistance or number of windings.
