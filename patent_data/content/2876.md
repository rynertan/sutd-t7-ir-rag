# Method of producing hydrothermally hardened products.

## Abstract
Hydrothermally cured articles are formed by mixing a filler and a binder, moulding this mixture and coating said moulded articles with silica or calcium oxide containing particles. Hydrothermal curing comprises a first step wherein the steam pressure in the autoclave is increased, thereafter the steam pressure is decreased and subsequently the pressure is increased up to a steam pressure being higher than in the first step.
