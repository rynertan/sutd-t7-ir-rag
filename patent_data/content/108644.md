# A charge control apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for controlling the electrical charging of a photoconductive member 10 used in an electrophotog raphic printing machine is described. The apparatus has a pair of corona generating devices 26, 36 . The second corona generating device 36 detects the level of charge on the photoconductive surface 12 after the charging thereof by the first corona generating device 26 . In response to the detected charge level, the second corona generating device 36 transmits a control signal to the first corona generating device 26 so as to regulate the charge on the photoconduc tive member 10 .
