# A method of manufacturing rubber modified styrene resins and resins produced by such a method.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing rubber modified styrene resins comprises the steps of a polymerizing a styrene monomer in the presence of a polymer rubber comprising butadiene moieties and optionally an organic peroxide in the ratio of 100 parts by weight, 3 to 15 parts by weight and 0 to 0.01 parts by weight respectively until the polymerization yield of the styrene monomer becomes 2 to 5 times the origi nal weight of the polymer rubber and b polymerizing the full amount of polymer mixture from step a and 0 to 200 parts by weight of fresh styrene monomer in the presence of 0.01 to 0.9 parts by weight of organic peroxide until the polymerization yield of the styrene monomer specific to step b becomes at least 1.5 times the polymerization yield of the styrene mono mer in step a . The molded product of the resin thus obtained shows an improved impact strength at the portions where polystyrene molecule orientation tends to occur.
