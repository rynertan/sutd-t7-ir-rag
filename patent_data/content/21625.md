# Electrolytic membrane cell.

## Abstract
A electrolytic cell comprises two or more units wherein each unit comprises a gas and liquid permeable anode 2 in close contact with one surface of a cation exchange membrane 1 and a gas and liquid permeable cathode 3 which is in close contact with the other surface of the membrane a gas and liquid permeable current collector 4 which is in close contact with a back surface of said naode 2 and a gas and liquid permeable current collector 5 which is in close contact with a back surface of said cathode. A partition wall made of a cathode side conductor 6 and an anode side conductor 7 is interposed between the two units, said cathode side conductor 6 being in contact with a current collector 5 which in turn is in contact with a cathode 3 and said anode side conductor 7 being in contact with a current collector 4 which is in contact with an anode 2 . An electrolyte solution is fed into said current collector 4 in contact with said anode and an electrolyzed solution is discharged from said current collector 5 in contact with said cathode.
