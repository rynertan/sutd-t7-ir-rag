# Process for the production of alginate fibre material and products made therefrom.

## Abstract
A process for producing dried alginate fibre material, in which wet spun insoluble alginate fibres are overlaid in a sheet 25 onto a more slowly moving liquid permeable conveyor 26 and are subjected to a dewatering drying operation, includes special treatment to eliminate or reduce bonding of the overlaid fibres at their points of contact or intersection. This is accomplished preferably by passing the dried sheet or web 50 that is produced through successive pairs of rollers 40, 42 , driven at different speeds so as to pull the individual fibres longitudinally and break any existing inter fibre bonds. Also, prior to and during initial drying of the sheet 25 of wet fibres application thereto of external mechanical forces is avoided and alcohol exchange to remove water may be used. The rollers 40, 42 may advantageously reduce a stretch breaking effect. The algin ate fibre material 50 produced is particularly suitable for making up medical or surgical dressings and the like.
