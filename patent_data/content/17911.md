# Polymer compositions and their production.

## Abstract
Increasing the solids content of an aqueous dispersoid of a a resin having aliphatic backbone carbons b addition polymer, and c graft polymer consisting of addition polymer grafted to the aliphatic carbon atoms of said resin which comprises bringing together ethylenically unsatur ated monomer, initiator, and such dispersoid, and polymeriz ing the such monomer in situ. Preferred products produced are water reducible epoxy resin based. These are produced by a process which com prises initiating addition polymerization of ethylenically unsa turated monomer in the presence of such dispersoid.
