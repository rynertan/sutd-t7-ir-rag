## Description
In Mould Coating Com ositions Containing Functional Group Terminated Liquid Polymers THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to moulded thermosetting plastic articles and especially fibre reinforced plastic articles and more particularly to coating compositions and methods for applying them to cover surface defects such as sink marks, porous areas, microcracks and open knit lines. The invention is more particularly directed to stable liquid coating compositions having extended shelf life which can be used as a single system for coating cured compositions, are particularly useful when applied to moulded substrates that have improved adherence, and can be substituted for a sanding and primer coating operation normally required for such uncoated articles prior to painting. In mould coating, compositions and methods of application are well known and in particular are described in British Patent 1,457,935. Such processes require inJecting a resin compound mixed with reinforcing fibres, usually glass fibres, in the form of either a sheet moulding compound or a bulk moulding compound into a shaped mould, compressing the mould to form the desired part applying heat to cure the resin, opening the mould slightly, inJecting a coating composition to fill the space between the substrate and the open mould face, closing the mould slightly to squeeze the coating uniformly over the surface to a thickness of less than 0.5mm usually from 0.01 to 0.13mm and curing the coating.In the present state of the art, the coating compositions are derived from a two component system which when mixed begins to polymerise and normally gels within a few hours or days at which point it becomes useless as an in mould coating composition. Furthermore, such two components require exact metering and measuring at the point of their use in order to derive a satisfactory coating having uniform properties and curing times. The coating compositions presented hereinafter provide the sheet moulder with a single mix composition which has stability for six or more months when stored under normal conditions and requires no accurate mixing of ingredients prior to use as an in mould coating. The invention provides therefore a method of forming a compression or inJection moulded, fully cured, reinforced thermoset article with a compression or injection moulded coating having a smooth surface, superior adherence and adequate hardness. The invention also provides a compression or injection moulded completely cured reinforced thermoset article having a compression or injection moulded coating. The invention also provides a moulding composition useful in providing a superior compression or injection moulded coating having superior adherence smoothness and durability when applied to a compression or injection moulded completely cured reinforced thermoset article. The coating composition according to the invention comprise a liquid mixture of an unsaturated polyester or polyurethane resin, a copolymerisable monomer and a functional group terminated liquid polymer having the general formula EMI2.1 wherein Y is OH, an aliphatic hydroxyl group containing radical of 2 10 carbon atoms, a vinyl group containing radical of 2 10 carbon atoms or a univalent radical obtained by removing hydrogen from an amine group of an aliphatic, alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic amine containing at least two primary and or secondary amine groups, and B is a polymeric backbone comprising carbon carbon linkages.Generally the carbon carbon linkage in B comprises at least about 90N by weight of total polymeric backbone weight, more preferably at least about 95 by weight of. total polymeric backbone weight. The amine terminated polymers contain an average from about 1.7 to about 3 primary and or secondary amine groups per molecule of polymer more preferably from about 1.7 to about 2.3 primary and or secondary amine groups per molecule.The amine terminated polymers may have Brookfield viscosities measured using a Brookfield RVT viscometer at 270C from about 500 cps to about 2,500,000 cps more preferably from about 500 cps to about 500,000 cps the hydroxyl terminated about 100,000 150,000 cps the carboxyl terminated 40,000 265,000 cps and the vinylterminated 85,000 600,000 cps. The reactive liquid polymers can be prepared from available polymers having the required polymeric backbone but different functional groups and in particular from carboxyl terminated polymers. For example, reactive liquid polymers may be prepared as described inUS 4,058,657 such teachings are hereby incorporated by reference . Carboxyl terminated or ester terminated liquid polymers having a carbon carbon backbone are reacted with at least one aliphatic, alicyclic or heterocyclic amine containing at least two primary and or secondary amine groups. Amine terminated liquid polymer is also prepared by reacting an acid chlorideterminated liquid polymer having a carbon carbon backbone with at least one aliphatic, alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic amine containing at least two primary and or secondary amine groups. The carboxyl terminated polymers used in manufacturing the reactive liquid polymers, especially the amine terminated materials, may contain polymerised units of at least one vinylidene monomer having at least one terminal ethylenically unsaturated group which may be selected from the group consisting of a mono olefins containing 2 to 14 carbon atoms, but preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms such as ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, l butene, l pentene, l hexene, l dodecene and the like b dienes containing 4 to 10 carbon atoms more preferably 4 8 carbon atoms such as butadiene, isoprene, 2 isopropyl 1,3 butadiene, chloroprene and the like c vinyl and allyl esters of carboxylic acids containing 2 8 carbon atoms such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, allyl acetate and the like d vinyl and allyl ethers, having allyl radicals containing 1 8 carbon atoms such as vinyl methyl ether, allyl methyl ether and the like and e acrylic acids and acrylates such as ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, octadecyl acrylate, methoxyethyl acrylate, butoxyethyl acrylate, hexylthioethyl acrylate, cyanoethyl acrylate, cyanooctyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, and mixtures thereof. The above described vinylidene monomers are readily epimerized with 0 50 and more preferably up to about 355 by weight of at least one comonomer selected from the group consisting of f vinyl aromatics such as styrene, a methyl styrene, chlorostyrene, vinyl toluene and the like g vinyl nitrile such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile and the like h vinyl halide such as vinyl bromide, vinyl chloride and the like i divinyls and diacrylates such as divinyl benzene, divinyl ether, diethylene glycol diacrylate and the like j amides of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids containing 2 8 carbon atoms such as acrylamide and the like and k allyl alcohol and the like. Examples of preferred liquid carboxyl terminated polymers include carboxyl terminated polyethylene, carboxyl terminated polyisobutylene, carboxyl terminated polybutadiene, carboxyl terminated polyisoprene, carboxyl terminated poly ethylacrylate as well as carboxyl terminated copolymers of butadiene and acrylonitrile and of butadiene and styrene. Carboxyl terminated copolymers of butadiene with acrylonitrile or styrene are found to be especially useful. These polymers may contain from 50 100, by weight of butadiene, from about 0 40 by weight of acrylonitrile or styrene and from about 0.4 10 by weight of carboxyl, based upon the total weight of the polymer. Of particular suitability are materials wherein the mole ratio of butadiene acrylonitrile average about 5 1 and have carbon carbon chains in the range of 200 300 carbon atoms.Carboxyl terminated liquid polymers can be prepared by free radical polymerisation using carboxyl containing initiators and or modifiers as disclosed in US Patent 3,285,949 and by solution polymerisation using lithium metal or organo metallic compounds and post treating the polymer to form carboxyl groups as disclosed in US Patents 3,135,716 and 3,431,235. The polymers can also be prepared by reacting liquid polymers having other than terininal carboxyl groups with compounds so as to yield carboxyl groups. For example, they can be prepared from hydroxyl terminated liquid polymers by reaction with dicarboxyl compounds. The essential features of the polymer are that it have at least terminal carboxyl groups and a polymeric backbone comprising carbon carbon linkage.The presence of ethylenic unsaturation in the carbon chain appears to produce no significant improved results. Once a carboxyl terminated polymer has been formed it can be isolated by methods well known to the art in order to produce acid chloride terminated liquid polymers.Furthermore, it can be esterified to provide esterterminated polymers, all of which are reactive with amines to produce the amine terminated liquid polymer useful in the practice of this invention. Amines which react well with the carboxyl terminated, ester terminated and acetyl terminated polymers described above include aliphatic amines containing 1 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 12 carbon atoms and at least 2 primary and or secondary amine groups. Also suitable are alicyclic amines containing 4 20 carbon atoms, most preferably 4 12 carbon atoms and at least 2 primary and or secondary amine groups. Heterocyclic amines may also be used which contain from 2 20 carbon atoms, more specifically 2 12 carbon atoms and at least 2 primary and or secondary amine groups. Preferably the amine has 2 amine groups which may be 2 primary or 2 secondary or 1 primary and 1 secondary. Examples of suitable amines just described include aliphatic amines such as ethylenediamine, 1, 2 propanediamine, 1, 3 propanediamine, 1, 4 butanediamine, 2 methyl 1,2 propanediamine, 1, 5 pentanediamine, 1, 6 hexanediamine, 1,7 heptanediamine, 1,8 octanediamine, l,10 decanediamine, 1,12 dodecanediamine and the like aliphatic polyamines such as diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, bis hexamethylene triamine, 3,3 iminobispropylamine and the like alicyclic diamines and polyamines such as 1,2 diaminocyclohexane, 1,8 p menthanediamine and the like and heterocyclic diamines and polyamines such as 4 aminomethyl piperidine piperazine N aminoalkyl piperazines wherein each alkyl group contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as N 2 aminoethyl piperazine, N 3 aminopropyl piperazine,N,N bis 3 aminopropyl piperazine and the like. More preferably the amines just described contain at least two primary and or secondary amine groups having different reactivities which makes the amine termination reaction more likely than the coupling of the liquid polymers, and a smaller amine excess is requiredin order to avoid coupling. Examples of more preferred amines include some alicyclic amines such as l,8 p methanediamine and the like and some heterocyclic amines such as 4 aminomethyl piperidine and N aminoalkyl piperazines wherein the alkyl group contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms such asN 2 aminoethyl piperazine, N 3 aminopropyl piperazine and the like. Excellent results were obtained usingN 2 aminoethyl piperazine. Aromatic diamines and polyamines can be used to produce amine terminated polymers. The high temperature required for aromatic amine reaction with carboxylterminated polymers causes excessive degradation of reactants and products and is therefore much less preferred.However, aromatic amines react well with the acyl terminated polymers described heretofore. Suitable aromatic amines contain at least two primary or secondary amine groups bonded directly to at least one aromatic nucleus. Examples of suitable aromatic amines include 4, 5 acenaphthenediamine, 3,5 diaminoacridine, 1,4 dsaminoanthraquinone, 3,5 diaminobenzoic acid, 2,7 fluorenediamine, 1,5 naphthalenediamine, 1,8 naphthalenediamine, 2,4 toluenediamine, 2,6 toluenediamine, o phenylenediamine, m phenylenediamine, p phenylenediamine and the like. A solvent is not required for the amine termination reaction but may be used. Mixtures of solvents may also be used. Suitable solvents include aliphatic and cycloaliphatic ethers containing from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as tetrahydrofuran, diethylether and the like halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2 dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene and the like and esters containing from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as ethyl acetate, n butyl acetate, hexyl acetate, benzyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate and the like.Also suitable as solvents and more preferred are aromatic compounds having the formula EMI8.1 wherein R4 is hydrogen, halogen or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and at least two R4 s are hydrogen. More preferably R4 is hydrogen, chlorine or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 2 carbon atoms, and at least three R4 s are hydrogen. Suitable aromatic solvents include benzene, chlorobenzene, toluene, o , m , and p xylene, o , m and p diethylbenzene, cumene, mesitylene and the like. A sufficient quantity of at least one amine described heretofore may be reacted with a carboxylterminated, ester terminated or ac id chloride terminated liquid polymer described heretofore in order to produce an amine terminated liquid polymer containing from about 1.7 to about 3 primary and or secondary amine groups per molecule. Typically the average number of total carboxyl, ester or acid chloride groups in a liquid polymer before reaction will be from about 1.7 to about 3 groups per molecule, more preferably from about 1.7 to about 2.3 groups per molecule. In this typical case, from about 1.2 to about 6 mole equivalents and more, more preferably from about 1.2 to about 3 mole equivalents of at least one amine described heretofore can be used per mole equivalent of carboxylated, esterified or acylated liquid polymer described heretofore.However, when the carboxylated, esterified or acylated liquid polymer also contains polymerised therein appreciable amounts of acrylic acid, acrylates or the like, the amount of amine reacted must be limited so that the amine terminated liquid polymer contains no more than about 1.7 to about 3 primary and or secondary amine groups per molecule. No catalyst is required, and many types of mixing apparatus can be used in the amine termination reaction. For example, simple mixers can be used, including turbine stirrers as well as propeller mixers. Reaction components can be combined in any order. The reaction mixture may be heated or refluxed if a solvent is used at a temperature from about 80 C to about 1500C, typically for about 1 to 6 hours. The amine terminated liquid polymer may be purified by vacuum distillation or by washing with a solvent such as a benzene methanol mixture, followed by drying the polymer. Amine content of the amine terminated liquid polymers can be analysed qualitatively by infrared spectroscopy. Amine content can also be analysed quantitatively following the procedure described by Siggia,Quantitative Organic Analysis via Functional Groups,N.Y. Wiley and Sons, Inc. 1963, p.452 456. The amine terminated polymers used in examples 1 44 are prepared readily by following the above described procedures. For example, a dipiperazino terminated poly butadiene acrylonitrile having the general formula EMI9.1 wherein x is 5, y is 1, and m is 10 and the butadiene content is about 70 by weight of the polymer, the acrylonitrile content is about 17 by weight of the polymer and the amine end group content is about 14 by weight of the polymer. This material has a Brookfield viscosity of about 200,000 cps at 270C 0.050 0.055 amine equivalents per 100 weight, an equivalent weight based on 4 amino hydrogens of 840 925 a specific gravity of about 0.938 and a refractive index of 1.5172. This polymer is sold byB.F.Goodrich Company as HYCAR ATBN 1300x16 HYCAR is a Trade Mark and can be made by copolymerising a mixture of acrylonitrile with butadiene in the presence of a peroxide catalyst in mol ratios of 1 5 thereafter dicarboxylated and reacted with N 2 aminoethyl piperazine by a method described above. Liquid carboxyl terminated polymers may be prepared by a free radical polymerisation using carboxylcontaining initiators and or modifiers as disclosed inUS Patent 3,285,949 and by solution polymerisation using lithium metal or organo metallic compounds and post treating the polymers to form carboxyl groups as disclosed in US Patents 3,135,716 and 3,431,235. The polymers can also be prepared by reacting liquid polymers having other terminal functional groups which react with carboxylterminated materials. For example, liquid carboxylterminated polymers can be prepared from liquid hydroxyl terminated polymers by reaction with dicarboxyl compounds or anhydrides. Liquid halogen terminated polymers can be reacted with unsaturated anhydrides in the presence of Lewis acids to yield carboxyl groups.A preferred liquid carboxyl terminated polymer includes copolymers of butadiene and acrylonitrile.

The use of such material is demonstrated in Examples 49 and 50. The above described functional group terminated liquid polymers having about 1.7 3 functional groups per mol are present in the coating compositions according to the invention in admixture with a copolymerisable polyester and or polyurethane resin and a copolymerisable monomer.

The amount of diisocyanate or polyisocyanate employed should be equal to at least 2 mols per mol of bisphenol A derivative employed. The hydroxy terminated esters of acrylic or methacrylic acids which are used to form vinyl terminated urethane resins are prepared by reacting acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with an alkylene oxide selected from the group consisting of ethyleneoxide and propylene oxide.The reaction is carried out by methods that are well known in the art.

Example I Polyester Urethane Resin According to the procedure as outlined in Example A, a two molar portion of 2,2,4 trimethyl 1,3 pentanediol is condensed with a one molar portion of maleic anhydride and thereafter condensed with a two molar equivalent of toluene diisocyanate and a two molar equivalent of hydroxyethyl acrylate. This material is dissolved in styrene to form a 70 resin in monomer solution. In addition to those described above the polyester urethane resin can be substituted by polyester resin, such as those having terminal vinyl groups and which are condensation products of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids or acid derivatives with a polyepoxide resin having more than one epoxide group per molecule. Representative of this group of resins are the condensation products formed by reacting methacrylic, acrylic or cinnamic acid with a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A or condensations of this epoxide with hydroxy containing compounds having 5 15 carbon atoms e.g. 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, cellosolve acrylate, hydroxybutyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate or their methacrylate equivalents and similar compounds as provided for in US Patents 3,720,592, 3,373,075, 3,306,954 and 3,342,896.Such materials are made commercially available by Dow Chemical Company as Derakane resins Derakane is a trade mark . Of particular interest is a styrene solution containing 65 Derakane 470 36 which is the major ingredient in Examples 29, 30 and 31. Certain ethylenically unsaturated polyester condensation products, such as that prepared by condensing two molar equivalents of maleic anhydride and one molar equivalent of terephthalic acid with three molar equivalents of propylene glycol may also be used as the unsaturated polyester in the coating compositions according to the invention. The coating compositions of the invention are homogeneous mixtures of the above described components.Suitable coatings containing 20 50 by weight of the unsaturated polyester or polyurethane component 2 15 by weight of the functional group terminated liquid copolymer and 30 60N by weight of copolymerisable monomer have been produced. In addition to these components, the blend may contain anti oxidants, mould release agents, adhesion promoters, pigments, fillers, dispersing agents and catalysts. A translucent coating is made by blending the liquid amine terminated polymers, the vinyl ester urethane components, along with monomers, anti oxidant, mould release agent and free radical type initiator catalyst.Translucent compositions are listed as parts by weight of the blend in Table 1, while pigmented coatings are described in Tables II, III, and IV. These coating compositions are cured in contact with fully cured sheet moulding compositions as shown in the following examples Example J Polyester Sheet Moulding Resin Into a 12 x 12 flat mould is placed a gelled pancake made according to a process of US Patents 4,062,826 and 4,073,828 containing 655 fibreglass and 35N of a polyurethane thickened resin composition containing 90 parts by weight of a 40 styrene solution of preformed polyester resin comprising isophthalic acid, maleic acid and propylene glycol 4.5 by weight of a polyol mixture containing 9 parts polyoxyethylene bisphenol A, having an average of 2 ethylene oxide units and 1 part by weight of a polyoxypropylated bisphenol A containing 2 mols of propyleneoxide per mol of bisphenol A 0.2 parts of a styrene solution containing 10 parabenzoquinone 1 part by weight of dibutyltin dilaurate 1 part by weight triethylamine 3 parts by weight zinc stearate 1 part of a peroxy ketal catalyst, such as l,l di t butyl peroxy cyclohexane or l,l di t butyl peroxy 3,3,5 trimethyl cyclohexane in 75 phthalate plasticiser and 5.5 parts ofRubinate M, a commercially available 4,4 diphenylmethane polydiisocyanate having an average of 2.7 isocyanate groups per mol is moulded into a sheet having a thickness of 6.4mm at a temperature of 135 1500C under a pressure of 27 ts. After 2 minutes the mould is opened and 5 10 grams of peroxide catalysed coating compositions as described inTables I and II are added from a syringe or automatically. The mould is closed under 27 ats pressure and after two minutes the coating cured over the SMC part moulded and then taken from the mould. After 24 hours the cured coatings are tested for adhesion to the cured substrate according to a procedure outlined in the Amercian Society for Testing MaterialsTest ASTM D 3359 74 otherwise referred to as the crosscut tape test. Adhesion is rated from 0 5, 5 indicating the best adhesion. The rating for each composition is listed in Tables I, II, III and IV below.Example K Polyester Sheet Moulding Resin A gelled sheet moulding composition is made by blending 30 fibreglass and 70 of a resin composition having 60 parts of a polyester resin described in Example J 6 parts styrene 11.24 parts of the polyol mix described in Example J 24.28 parts prepolymer prepared by reacting 1 mol of Rucoflex S 1011 110 Rucoflex is a trade mark with 2 mols of toluene diisocyanate and having terminal isocyanate groups 0.2 parts 1046 parabenzoquinone 0.6 parts triethylamine 1.0 part of a 75, solution of the ketal catalyst, described in Example J 3 parts of zinc stearate 150 parts calcium carbonate and 4.48 Rubinate M polyisocyanate having a functionality of 2.7 isocyanate groups per mol. Example L Polyester Sheet Moulding Resin A sheet moulding compound containing 30 fibreglass and gelled resin having 16.8 parts of a commercially available ethylenically unsaturated polyester PARAPLEX P340 PARAP X is a trade mark polymethylmethacrylate having carboxyl groups in styrene 0.56 zinc stearate 0.7 magnesium hydroxide 0.28 parts t butylperoctoate catalyst and 42 parts calcium carbonate. This substrate was coated and tested as described in Example J, the results of which are listed in Tables I,II, III and IV. Example M Sheet Moulding Com position A sheet moulding composition is made by blending polyester containing 30 glass and 70 gelled resin containing 92 parts polyester resin as described in ExampleJ 4 parts polyol mix as described in Example J 1 part styrene 0.02 parts 10 solution parabenzoquinone 0.1 part polyoxyalkylene diamine condensate containing 3 mols of polypropylene oxide and 1 mol ethylene oxide sold under the trade mark RA 800 by Union Carbide Chemical Corporation 0.1 part dibutyltin dilaurate catalyst 1.0 part peroxide catalyst described in Example J 4 parts zinc stearate 140 parts aluminium trihydrate Alcoa Aluminium Co C 331 and 4.4 parts Rubinate M polyisocyanate Rubinate is a trade mark . The above compositions were tested as described in Examples J and L, the results of which are listed inTables I, II, III and IV as Examples 1 50. In addition to the polymerising components, the coating composition may contain a commonly used mould release agent in order to ensure the formation of a smooth surface. Metallic soaps such as zinc stearate and other agents such as the natural product Lecithin and duPont sZelec UN aliphatic phosphate have performed satisfactorily Zelec is a trade mark . Various other common additives which are normally incorporated with the coating composition such as extenders, flexibilizers and colloidal silica may be used in accordance with standard moulding practice.Coloured pigments, when added to the coating composition, make it possible to fill sink marks and other defects to provide a glossy, pigmented surface all in one operation, so that when the part is removed from the mould it is ready for use without any additional operations such as hand sanding, finishing and conventional finish coating. Such coloured primer coats are usually made by incorporating carbon black, clay, iron oxide, lithopone, mica, silicious materials, titanium dioxide and coloured pigments. The reaction between the ethylenically unsaturated vinyl ester urethane and the vinylidene monomer is usually activated by the presence of a catalyst, for example, a peroxide like benzoyl peroxide, cyclohexanone peroxide, ditertiary butyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide and tertiarybutyl perbenzoate. Some of these catalysts react at low temperatures to initiate free radicals, while others are activated at higher temperatures, and others by an accelerator such as a dilute solution of cobalt soap or an amine. The selection of the free radical initiator catalysts is important if one is to control the temperature at which the vinylidene monomer polymerisation takes place. Inhibitors are sometimes used to prevent premature action by the catalyst.In the performance of the present invention, it is preferred that the polyvinylidene polymerisation takes place within the mould at the temperature of the mould. The compositions of the invention may also be used as a spray type primer when certain circumstances are required to repair a fender part which has been damaged to the point where a smooth surface must be generated outside the mould. In such instances, the spray composition may contain a light activated free radical initiating catalyst to cure the coating composition. In addition to the reactive polymerising materials may be added a minor portion 2 10 by weight of an anti swelling agent selected from the groups consisting of epoxide resins having reactive ethoxide groups which include, for example, Cardura E available from ShellChemical Company Cardura is a trade mark which is a glycidyl ester produced by reacting epichlorohydrin and a mixture of saturated highly branched mainly tertiary monocarboxylic acids having 9 11 carbon atoms GenepoxyN 205 Genepoxy is a trade mark , which is a modified diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, available from GeneralMills, Inc. Epon 812 Epon is a trade mark , which is diglycidyl ether of glycerol, available from Shell ChemicalCompany Epon 826, which is substantially pure diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, and Epon 828, which is a slightly resinified form of Epon 826, available from Shell ChemicalCompany.Such other materials as glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate are also useful. Such epoxide containing materials are useful in concentrations ranging from about 2 to 15 by weight of the coating composition and are thought to deactivate reactive amine sites which are available in the amine terminated liquid polymers. The use of these anti swelling agents is demonstrated inExamples 25 28 as shown in Table II.
