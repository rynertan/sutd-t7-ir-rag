## Description
VACUUM BAGGINGThis invention relates to a method and apparatus useful in the production of resin filled, carbon, glass, synthetic material and metal laminate structures otherwise known as composites by the vacuum bagging system and in particular relates to an improved seal therefor.Vacuum bagging is a term used to describe a method of producing pressure and vacuum on the various resin filled, carbon, glass, synthetic materials and metal laminates otherwise known as composites while curing and consolidation takes place, usually by means of heating in a pressurised autoclave or oven. The method may be used in production of various composite parts useful in the aircraft and performance motor car industries.The initial method used involved laying up the component together with layers of release sheets, bleeder cloths, air bleed ropes, rubber compression sheets and the like, on a metal or composite base covering the whole with an impervious sheet of flexible plastic material and securely sealing the latter to the base plate. This was achieved by means of a special acrylic sealant putty and or adhesive tapes to allow a vacuum to be drawn within the flexible plastic material sheet or bag . The bag is draped over the contours of the component and to ensure a good lay up and an efficient vacuum seal the process needs careful workmanship and takes a considerable time to operate. After curing in the autoclave or oven the vacuum bag must be removed with the special putty, which entails considerable cleaning up of the base plate and the bag and putty must often be replaced.In our UK Patent number 2073648 there is described an improved apparatus for forming a vacuum bag which comprises a base, ribbing fixed to the base about its perimeter, a stretchable membrane held within a framework and able to form a seal with the said ribbing, and means of fastening the framework to the base thereby forming a seal between the ribbing and the stretchable membrane, and means for forming a vacuum between the membrane the ribbing and the base.The latter apparatus works very well in most applications but suffers from two disadvantages. Firstly, the ribbing is fixed to the base plate of the mould and must therefore normally be secured in position on site in the user s factory. Secondly, when the mould component being produced involves very deep cavities the raised ribbing can in some circumstances prevent the membrane from evenly contacting the mould components after the vacuum is drawn. The present invention seeks to provide a form of the apparatus disclosed in our above mentioned UK patent in which the seal is modified to overcome or reduce the above mentioned disadvantages.According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for forming a vacuum bag which comprises a stretchable membrane held within a framework and carrying affixed to the membrane a resilient seal defining a cavity within which a vacuum can be drawn when the framework and membrane are placed on a mould base, and means for connecting the cavity with a source of vacuum.Preferably the seal comprises a pair of tubular members formed of a resilient plastic materials between them defining a vacuum cavity. When in place on a mould base the tubular members each seal with the base and vacuum drawn into the cavity pulls this seal tight. Conveniently the outer tubular member is provided with a flexible curtain depending downwardly and which serves the purpose of enabling a preliminary seal to be formed when vacuum is first applied until the sealing members are drawn into sealing contact with the base, but this is not essential and maybe omitted. By the apparatus of the invention two distinctive advantages are realised. Firstly the sealing member is affixed to the membrane within its framework and so the assembly may be prefabricated without the necessity of the mould base being present provided its dimensions and contours are known in advance. Secondly, the seal is, in use, considerably shorter in height than the ribbing disclosed in our above mentioned UK patent, allowing the membrane to stretch further into deep mould cavities.Advantageously the framework doubles as a vacuum manifold, i.e. it is hollow and supplies vacuum to the seal via one or more passages in the seal to the cavity communicating with the vacuum manifold framework. The latter may be a vacuum tight box section, e.g. of aluminium, or a convoluted metal, e.g. steel, hose.Preferably, as before, curing is carried out by heating the bagged lay up, for example, in an autoclave or oven.Consequently, the materials from which the various components are made are of necessity capable of standing curing temperatures without degredation. The preferred material for the membrane is an elastomeric silicone rubber sheet having elongation and tear strength properties and being capable of continued service at temperaures in the region of 400of 200 CC . Similarly the tubular members which form the vacuum cavity seal should also be of a similar material. The membrane with its vacuum cavity seal is attached to a framework, for example an aluminium box section, so that the membrane may be handled easily. This is especially important when the apparatus is used in the making of relatively large lay ups. The membrane and seals within the frame can be easily placed in its correct position over the base and the framework, membrane and seals are accurately located and contacted to the base by clipping the frame to the base. The rigid framework with the vacuum cavity seals has the further advantage that it secures and seals the perimeter of the membrane while the vacuum within the bag is drawn thus dispensing with the need for separate adhesive tape and the like which was formerly used in these circumstances.Where the seals comprise of tubular members it is advantageous to provide bleed holes to atmosphere to prevent pressure build up during autoclaving. The invention will be described further, by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a diagrammetic sectional view of an apparatus in accordance with the invention on a mould base andFigure 2 is a more detailed sectional view on a larger scale of the seal. Referring to the drawings, the apparatus comprises an outer vacuum manifold framework 10 for example of aluminium, to which is affixed stretchable membrane 12. A seal generally designated 14 is bonded to the membrane 12 and the framework 10 by means of a suitable bonding agent or adhesive. The seal 14 may be integral with the membrane 12 or may be bonded thereto. As illustrated in figure 1, the apparatus is intended to be used in conjunction with a mould base 16 to which the vacuum manifold framework may be clipped by means of clips 30 and which may include one or more cavities 18 into which the membrane 12 is drawn during the vacuum bag operation.A preferred form of seal is illustrated more clearly in figure 2 and can be seen to comprise a pair of tubular members 20, 22 of a resilient elastomeric material bonded to the membrane 12 and defining between them a cavity 24.A tapering curtain 26 depending downwardly from the outer tubular member 22 may also be provided.In use, the vacuum manifold framework 10 is manufactured of a size and shape, for example rectangular, corresponding to the peripheral dimensions of the mould base 16. The membrane 12 is affixed thereto and the seal 14 also about the periphery of the membrane. The seal cavity 24 communicates with the manifold 10 ViA f more passages 27.This unit may then be taken to location of the mould base where it will be placed on top of the mould base over a lay up 32, for example in the cavity 18. The vacuum manifold framework 10 will be clipped to the base by means of clips 30. A vacuum is firstly drawn within the cavity 24 of the seal 14 by means, for example, of one or more vacuum valves 28 connected into the vacuum manifold framework and to a suitable vacuum source.As can be seen from figure 1 the curtain portion 26, when provided, forms a loose seal with the mould base edge which is enhanced when the vacuum is applied until the tubular members 20 and 22 are pulled into sealing engagement with the mould base 16 by means of the vacuum being drawn in the cavity 24 via the vacuum manifold.When this vacuum has been drawn, the apparatus is securely attached in sealing engagement with the mould base 16 and a vacuum can be drawn within the bag portion by means of a suitable valve 34 within the membrane 12. Alternatively, there may be communication between the vacuum cavity 24 and the mould cavity 18 so that a single vacuum source both forms the seal and draws the vacuum within the membrane 12. However in many cases this will not be preferred since the requirement may be to vent the vacuum in cavity 18 whilst retaining the vacuum in cavity 24 and therefore the integrity of the seal. It is often advantageous to be able to release and re apply the vacuum within the mould cavity 18 without disturbing the seal.The apparatus of the invention provides an excellent seal and furthermore allows the operative parts of the vacuum bagging opertion to be assembled away from the mould base and taken to the location of the mould base in a ready touse form.
