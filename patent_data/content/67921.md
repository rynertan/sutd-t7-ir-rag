# A method for determining bioactive substances.

## Abstract
An active membrane containing a reactive biofunctional molecule is coated on a substrate and the latter is contacted with a solution to be analyzed containing a complex conjugate of said molecule. The rate of complexion of said conjugate moiety with the membrane which is a function of its concentration in the analyte is measured by optical means and correlated with corresponding rates obtained from standard reference measurements, thus providing data for determining the unknown concentration of said conju gate moiety in the analyte.
