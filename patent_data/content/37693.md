# AN ADJUSTABLE INSERT SEAT AND WEDGE ASSEMBLY FOR AN INDEXABLE BORING CUTTER

## Abstract
A boring cutter which is adapted to be rotated about its central axis includes at least one insert pocket having opposed parallel leading and trailing walls, as well as a bot tom wall. An insert seat of generally L shaped configuration is provided, with the leading surface of the insert seat being in abutting relationship with the leading wall of the pocket. The opposed trailing surface of the insert seat includes both a leading and rear locating support surface adapted to receive an indexable cutting insert. A wedge is receivable between the rear surface of the cutting insert and the trailing wall of the pocket. The radial position of both the insert seat and the wedge, relative to the central axis of the boring cutter is adjustable. By this arrangement, the radial position of the cutting insert may be varied to thereby adjust the effective outer diameter of the boring cutter. In addition, the amount of overhang, or the difference in the radial position between the cutting insert and the wedge, remains constant thereby main taining the structural support for the cutting edge of the insert.
