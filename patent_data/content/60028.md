# Cephalosporin derivatives and process for their preparation.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for producing an imidazole carboxylic acid derivative of the following general formula in the form of one or more sodium salt With the process for the present invention it ispossible to separate from the reaction solution the sodium salt s of the compound of formula 1 in a manner considerably easier that the production of sodium salts from other salts of the compound of formula 1 as previously disclosed. Moreover the sodium salts are less toxic than the corresponding potassium salts.
