# Dual chamber pacer with alternative rate adaptive means.

## Abstract
A dual chamber pacemaker system is disclosed with means for operating in one or another of alternate rate adaptive modes. The pacemaker incorporates an atrial synchronous mode, wherein pacing rate is determined as a function of sensed atrial signals. It also incorporates a T
