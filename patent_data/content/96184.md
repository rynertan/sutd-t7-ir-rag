# Method for controlling the energization of the print elements in an electroerosion printer.

## Abstract
Control circuit for selectively enabling the energization of printing elements 25 in sequence in a print head 26 to achieve a more nearly constant current flow in the print elements 25 to thereby produce recorded marks of more uniform size. The formation of the print elements 25 into gated small groups 25 1...25 17 25 2...25 18 reduces the maximum allowable current and, hence, the electromagnetic radiation. During traversal of the print head 26 along a print line, the lagging print element group 25 2...25 18 is enabled prior to the leading group 25 1...25 17 regardless of travel direction of the print head 26 in order to minimize the recording impedance for the energized print elements 25 .
