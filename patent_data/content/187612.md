# Abradable seal having particulate erosion resistance.

## Abstract
Porous plasma arc sprayed powder metal abradable materials used in knife edge labyrinth seals of gas turbine engines have their resistance to erosion improved when a thin ceramic surface layer containing fine aluminium particu late is applied. The fine equiaxed particulate and ceramic are applied as an aqueous liquid so that both the particulate and cermic matrix material fill the surface pores, without penet rating further into the powder metal material and thereby adversely affecting desirable abradability characteristics.
