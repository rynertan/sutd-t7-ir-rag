# Method and apparatus for splicing two twisted staple yarns.

## Abstract
A method for the splicing of two twisted staple yarns includes the steps of untwisting portions 6a, 7a of each yarn 6, 7 , drafting these portions to form beards 35 and retwisting the beards to form the splice 40 . In one aspect of the invention, the untwisting is effected by rolling the yarns between two surfaces 13 at nip point 18 to rotate the yarns. In a second aspect, each yarn is gripped between nips 18 at two locations defining the respective yarn portion which are spaced apart by a distance not signifi cantly greater then the mean yarn fibre length after untwist ing, the beards 35 are formed by drawing the ends of the yarns in opposite directions and longitudinally through the adjacent nips 18 , whereby both ends 35a of each beard 35 are held between the nips 18 defining the respective yarn portion 6a, 7a . Also disclosed is apparatus for carry ing out the respective aspects of the method.
