# AERIAL COUPLING DEVICE

## Abstract
An aerial coupling device enables an electronic circuit, such as a radio receiver or transmitter to be coupled to a body which then acts as an aerial. The aerial coupling device comprises one or more inductive elements 3 which may be part of respective resonating circuits 2 , supported by a bracelet or wrist strap 1 . Each inductive element 3 includes one or more loops or coils, which may be wound on a ferrite core 6 , the loops or coils extending in the direction of the arm, i.e. being transverse to the longitudinal axis of the bracelet or wrist strap. A case, such as a watch case 9 , attached to the bracelet or wrist strap 1 houses receiver or transmitter circuitry 7 and optionally a timing circuit and a time display 10 . The aerial coupling device may also be incorporated in other means, such as belt.
