## Description
This invention relates to an acoustic transducer. Acoustic transducers are well known in the prior art. They are employed for example in surface acoustic wave SAW devices such as electronic filters, as set out in Surface Wave Filters , Matthews, H. Ed , Wiley 1977. A typical transducer comprises a pattern of conductors laid upon a piezoelectric substrate. The conductors may take the form of two comparatively broad parallel metal contact pads arranged longitudinally with narrow lateral fingers extending inwardly therebetween. The fingers are interdigitated, and ac signals applied between the contact pads appear longitudinally between adjacent finger pairs to induce acoustic waves in the piezoelectric substrate. The waves may be SAW, SSBW surface skimming bulk wave or other similar waves. Such transducers are referred to as interdigital transducers or IDTs. Conventional SAW or SSBW filters incorporating IDTs are small, cheap, reproducible, passive and planar, and cover the frequency range 10 MHz to 1 GHz or more with excellent group delay and stop band rejection characteristics. However, it is well known that conventional SAW or SSBW IDTs are bi directional, ie the transducers generate acoustic waves in two mutually opposite directions. Accordingly, a conventional SAW filter incorporating two IDTs has an inherent insertion loss of 6 dB, since part of the signal generated by the emitting transducer is directed away from the receiving transducer. Furthermore, a spurious signal is generated known as the triple transit signal arising from multiple passage of acoustic waves through the device. Normal design arrangements to suppress the unwanted triple transit signal commonly increase the insertion loss to 20 dB. A number of techniques have been proposed to reduce the insertion loss of SAW filters. These include multistrip coupler based unidirectional IDTs Marshall et al., Electronics Letters, 1971, 7, pp 312 314 , two port resonators Marshall, F. G., Proc. 1975 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium pp 290 292 , nultiphase IDTs Rosenfeld et al., Proc. 28th Annual Frequency Control Symposium pp 299 303 , interdigitated IDTs Lewis, M. F., Proc. 1982 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium pp 12 17 , and so on. These prior art devices have one or more of a number of disadvantages, such as increased substrate area, complex fabrication and matching circuitry, and a restricted range of realisable filter characteristics. It has also been proposed Hartman et al., Proc. 1982 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium pp 40 45 to construct an IDT incorporating a superimposed reflector array having elements offset by λ 8 λ fundamental wavelength from spatial periodicity with the transducer finger centres. This device comprises a known interdigital finger arrangement produced by evaporating firstly aluminium on to a piezoelectric substrate, and secondly a gold reflector array produced by a second metal evaporation procedure. The reflector array reduces the 3 dB bidirectionality loss of the IDT arising from SAW generation in two opposite directions. It produces interference which enhances the required forward wave at the expense of the unwanted backward wave. However, this IDT has the disadvantage of requiring two evaporative processes for laying down the transducer fingers and reflector array, which must be carefully aligned with respect to one another to produce the necessary wave interference. It is an object of the invention to provide an alternative form of unidirectional interdigital transducer. The present invention provides an acoustic transducer arranged on a piezoelectric substrate as a ladder having rungs comprising interdigital fingers and having one or more reflector strips arranged in inter rung positions, characterised in that each reflector strip is offset by substantially λ 8 δ from a respective location distant nλ 2 from a transducer finger centre, where λ is a wavelength corresponding to the transducer centre frequency, n is an integer, and either δ is equal to zero, or, in the case of a transducer incorporating reflector strip arrays with combined unidirectional and blooming effects, δ is equal to λ 4π arcsin M N , where M is the number of transducer fingers per rung, N is the number of reflector strips per array and N is greater than M. The invention provides the advantages that transducer fingers and the reflector array may be laid down on a substrate in one metal evaporation process, instead of two such processes requiring mutual alignment as in the prior art. It is observed that the invention does not relate to ladder transducers with inter rung reflectors in locations other than λ 8 δ offsets from half wavelength periodicity with transducer fingers. Such transducers are known for the purposes of achieving improved bidirectional properties by blooming, and employ λ 4 offsets. See for example EP A 0,057,555. Transducer blooming will be described in detail later. The transducer may have more than two rungs with each inter rung space occupied by a respective reflector array of parallel strips. Each strip may be offset by substantially λ 8 from a respective location distant a discrete number of half wavelengths from a transducer finger centre, being the wavelength corresponding to the transducer fundamental frequency. The transducer may incorporate additional parallel reflector strips arranged externally of the rungs. The transducer finger length and or the reflector strip length may be weighted to obtain any desired transducer characteristics. Two transducers of the invention may be arranged on the same substrate to emit and receive acoustic waves either towards or away from one another, the former arrangement provided a bandpass filter and the latter a bandstop filter. The transducer may be associated with acoustic absorbers arranged on the substrate to absorb unwanted acoustic waves. The transducer may either be spatially periodic, i.e. have rungs separated by constant distances, or alternatively be aperiodic or have varying periodicity. The transducer may have weighted finger overlap varying in accordance with a sampled Fourier transform of a rectangular function with reflectors located in regions corresponding to zero overlap. Two such transducers may be formed on a substrate to provide a bandpass or bandstop filter. In order that the invention might be more fully understood, embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figure 1, which is not to scale, there are schematically shown two acoustic transducers 10 of the invention arranged to form a SAW filter. Each transducer 10 comprises two broad longitudinal upper and lower contact pads 11 and 12. The upper pads 11 have pairs of inwardly extending narrow fingers such as 14, and the lower pads 12 have individual fingers 15. The pads 11 and 12 and fingers 14 and 15 are formed by evaporating aluminium on to a piezoelectric substrate not shown and subsequent photolithography. The fingers 14 and 15 are interdigitated, and form regularly spaced finger groups such as 16 resembling the rungs of a ladder for which the contact pads 11 and 12 would be uprights. Because of this resemblance, transducers generally of the form 10 are referred to in the art as ladder transducers. AC signals applied across the contact pads 11 and 12 appear longitudinally between any two adjacent fingers 14 and 15, or finger pair, and produce acoustic waves in the piezoelectric substrate. In the art, the term finger pair accordingly refers to two adjacent fingers, one from each contact pad but not a split finger from one pad . The transducers 10 have inter rung spaces 17 occupied by reflector arrays 18. A further reflector array 19 is located adjacent to each transducer 10 remote from the other. Each reflector array 18 or 19 incorporates five narrow reflector strips such as 20. Each strip 20 is 1 4λ wide, and the gap between adjacent strips is also 1 4λ, λ being the acoustic wavelength corresponding to the filter centre frequency. The spacing between centres of adjacent strips 20 is accordingly λ 2. It should be noted that λ varies along a transducer, having differing values in metal coated and uncoated substrate regions. This is well known in the art, and in practice λ is an average value. The reflector arrays 18 and 19 of each transducer 10 are arranged to enhance SAW propagation towards the other transducer and to reduce SAW propagation away from it. This is achieved by positioning the reflector arrays 18 and 19 to provide constructive interference in one direction and destructive interference in the other, as will be described. Referring now to Figure 2, there is shown a section 30 of a ladder transducer 10 in more detail, although not to scale, parts equivalent to those described in Figure 1 being like referenced. For clarity, only one reflector strip 20 is shown. The section 30 corresponds to the left hand transducer 10 in Figure 1. It has two finger groups 16₁ and 16₂ with centres indicated by chain lines 31 and 32 respectively. A chain line 33 indicates points mid way between centres 31 and 32. The distance between centres 31 and 32 or rung to rung period is P, where P 2nλ, n being an integer and λ the wavelength previously defined. The transducer section 30 has an aperture Q indicated by arrow 34 and given by the overlap of adjacent fingers 14 and 15. Q may be in the order of 50λ to 100λ. The reflector strip 20 is positioned as indicated by chain line 35 offset by λ 8 from the mid point 33 of finger group or rung centres 31 and 32. Other reflecting strips see Figure 1 are arranged with centres spaced at 1 2λ intervals from that of strip 20. Acoustic waves produced by finger group 16₁ and propagating to the right comprise portions A and B indicated by arrows 36 and 37 transmitted and reflected by the reflector strip 20 respectively. Acoustic waves produced by finger group 16₂ and propagating to the left comprise portions C and D transmitted and reflected by the strip 20 and indicated by arrows 38 and 39 respectively. The filter illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 operates as follows. An acoustic reflector array such as 18 comprising periodic reflectors constitutes a reciprocal symmetrical two port junction. If the junction is lossless, a wave of unit amplitude incident at one side or port of the array produces transmitted and reflected amplitudes s₁₂ and s₁₁ which are in phase quadrature when referred to the reflector array centre. This result may be derived from a similar analysis to that for the three port case given by Lewis, M.F. in IEEE 1983 These particular orthogonal combinations are chosen because they are not mutually coupled by a symmetric or antisymmetric junction. Each accordingly emerges at full intensity but with a phase shift, ie they emerge as Thus s₁₁ The transducers 10 are arranged to emit or receive acoustic waves to or from one another. In view of their unidirectional properties, generation of unwanted acoustic waves travelling away from the receiving transducer is greatly reduced. This greatly reduces the insertion loss generated by the filter arrangement of Figure 1. The unidirectional properties of the transducers 10 are independent of the reflection mechanism of the strips 20. These properties obtain for reflection in SAW devices by mass loading, topographical effects, piezoelectric shorting or combinations thereof. Any significant loss in the reflector strips 20 would modify the λ 8 offset condition, but then the transducer or device incorporating it would not exhibit low loss. Accordingly the offset in any practical device would be substantially, that is very close to λ 8, or the equivalent for reflector arrangements which provide both for unidirectionality and blooming, as will be described later. Since the reflector strips 20 are located in inter rung spaces 17 or adjacent each transducer 10, there is no requirement to overlay transducer fingers with reflectors as in the prior art. Accordingly, the fingers and reflectors may be laid down in one metal evaporation process without the need to align a finger pattern with a subsequent reflector pattern a difficult task which increases costs. Furthermore, the reflector strips may be electrically isolated from one another and from the transducer, or may be shorted together, and earthed if necessary as appropriate in individual arrangements to optimise performance. This is not possible in the prior art, in which gold reflectors are shorted electrically to transducer fingers. Inter rung reflectors may be employed in accordance with the invention with a ladder transducer having any conventional finger groups or rungs. Referring now to Figures 3, 4 and 5, which are not to scale, there are shown three different forms of finger group indicated generally by 40, 50 and 60 respectively. Finger group 40 is of the one into one variety. Each contact pad 41 has two inwardly extending fingers 42 which are λ 4 in width. Each gap such as 43 between a finger of one pad and an adjacent finger of the other is also λ 4, finger centres being spaced λ 2 apart. Conventional anti reflection or blooming strips 44 are located adjacent to the finger group 40. The strips 44 have λ 4 widths and gaps therebetween, and are offset by λ 4 from a spatially periodic continuation of the transducer finger pattern of λ 2 between finger centres. Depending on the number of fingers 42, ie on the strength of reflections from the finger group, the reflectors 44 may sometimes be omitted. Finger group 50 comprises contact pads 51 with inwardly extending split fingers such as 52. Reflector arrays not shown in accordance with the invention would be located relative to the centre 53 of the respective internal gap 54 of a split finger. Adjacent centres 53 are λ 2 apart, and individual fingers 52 and internal gaps 54 are λ 8 wide. Split fingers have properties which avoid reflections occurring at transducer working frequencies. Finger group 60 is of the two into one variety, a first contact pad 61 having four inwardly extending fingers 62 per rung and the other pad 63 having two fingers 64. Finger widths and gaps are λ 6. The patterns of fingers shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5 may be extended laterally to provide larger finger groups if required to produce transducers with particular properties. In addition to transducers such as 40, 50 or 60 having constant finger overlap, finger length weighting may be employed as in the prior art to obtain specific transducer characteristics. In particular, finger overlap and phasing may be varied in accordance with a Fourier transform along filter transducers in order to improve filter passband characteristics and reduce sidebands. Such a transducer is shown in Figure 6. The transducer 70 has contact pads 71 and interdigital fingers such as 72. Finger overlap weighting and phasing is arranged as nearly as possible in accordance with a Fourier transform of a rectangular or square function, f x , eg f x a constant for x₁ x x₂, and f x 0 elsewhere. Although adjacent fingers extend largely from alternate contact pads 71, as indicated at four regions 73 two fingers extend from the same respective contact pad 71. This corresponds to phase reversal between adjacent lobes of the sin x x Fourier transform function for a square filter passband. In accordance with the invention, the transducer 70 would have associated reflector strips not shown to provide unidirectional properties, and a filter having two such transducers would have an approximately square passband. For example, the transducer 70 may be sampled , ie have fingers omitted to provide spaces to accommodate reflector strips. Conveniently, fingers may be omitted at regions 73 of zero finger overlap. Other options in transducer design include the use of absorbing material on the piezoelectric substrate to attenuate unwanted acoustic waves. Referring now to Figure 7, there is shown a SAW filter 80 incorporating two ladder transducers 81₁ and 81₂ of the invention on a lithium niobate piezoelectric substrate. The transducers are shown slightly closer together than in the actual device for presentational purposes. The transducers 81₁ and 81₂ have respective upper contact pads 82₁ and 82₂, lower contact pads 83₁ and 83₂, ten rungs such as 84₁ and 84₂ and inter rung reflector arrays such as 85₁ and 85₂. The rungs 84 incorporate five split fingers such as 86 see Figure 4 , three of which per rung extend from upper contact pads 82 and two from lower contact pads 83. The reflector strips such as 87 in the arrays 85 are λ 4 wide with λ 4 gaps, so that the strips are spaced by λ 2, where λ is 34.5 µm for the filter centre frequency of 100 MHz. The rung to rung period or rung centre spacing is 8λ in transducer 81₁ and 10λ in transducer 81₂. There are ten and fourteen reflector strips per array 85 in transducers 81₁ and 81₂ respectively. The transducers 81₁ and 81₂ have additional external reflector arrays 88₁ and 88₂ respectively which are periodic extensions of arrays 85₁ and 85₂. The reflector arrays 85₁ and 85₂ are offset by λ 8 to the right and left respectively from symmetrical positioning in inter rung spaces. This can be seen from the differing finger group reflector array separations either side of rungs 84 in the transducers 81. This offset towards the other transducer in either case produces unidirectionality of the transducers towards one another in Y Z lithium niobate ie the transducers 81 emit or receive acoustic waves preferentially towards one another, which is termed a face to face configuration. This would not necessarily be the case for other piezoelectric materials, since it is necessary to test a given transducer and material for output direction. The analysis given earlier did not predict the output direction. If the offset were to have been away from the other transducer, a back to back configuration would have resulted. Figure 7 is an enlarged reproduction of the art work of a practical SAW filter. The filter s actual length was about 7 mm measured between the outermost strips of reflector arrays 88₁ and 88₂, but it had a slightly larger gap than the scale of the drawing would imply. The separation of the transducers 81 if perfect is not absolutely critical, but preferably the reflector arrays of one transducer would be located as periodic extensions of those of the other. The filter of Figure 7 was tested together with a comparison filter having identical transducers but in a back to back configuration, ie reflector arrays offset by λ 8 away from the other transducer. In both cases the transducers were aluminium evaporated onto a Y Z lithium niobate substrate. The filters were mounted in a T08 container, and the contact pads were 0.15 µm thick with gold wire bonds. Each transducer was shunt tuned with a wire wound inductor of 100 nH to achieve a close match to 50 ohms. The performance of the test filters is shown in Figure 8, which shows three curves a , b and c . Curves a and c show filter attenuation as a function of frequency, and corresponds to transducers face to face and back to back respectively. The fundamental or centre frequency of 100 MHz is indicated at 90, and the frequency scale is 0.5 MHz per division, curves covering the region 97 MHz to 103 MHz. The ordinate scale is 5 dB per division. Curve b shows the variation in group delay through the face to face filter curve a , the ordinate scale being 1 µsec per division referred to a baseline 91 with the same frequency scale. A practical bandpass SAW filter of the invention would exhibit the curve a characteristic of a central maximum 92 or passband with associated subsidiary maxima such as 93. The filter had a measured insertion loss at the 100 MHz fundamental frequency of only 2.7 dB. This compares with a minimum The high degree of unidirectionality of the transducers is indicated by a pronounced central minimum 95 in curve c at the 100 MHz fundamental frequency. The minimum 95 corresponds to a loss of 31.9 dB, or about 29 dB below the position of the corresponding maximum 92 in curve a . The back to back transducers employed for the curve c filter generate and receive acoustic waves predominantly away from one another at 100 MHz, so that the fundamental frequency is strongly rejected. This property could be used to provide a bandstop filter. Tests were also performed using the curve a or face to face filter in a completely untuned configuration. This resulted in an insertion loss of still only 3 dB, although with somewhat greater passband group delay ripple. This embodiment s comparative insensitivity to lack of tuning is of importance in applications requiring minimisation of size, cost or vibration sensitivity. Referring now to Figure 9, there is shown a section 100 of a ladder transducer of the invention which is bloomed to reduce unwanted multiple transit signals. The term bloomed and similar expressions are employed by analogy with optical blooming of lenses with anti reflection coatings. The section 100 has two rungs 101 and 102 and a central bank 103 of thirty reflector strips such as 104 with λ 2 centre spacing. Banks 105 are shown in full and banks 106 in part. Each rung 101 102 has six fingers such as 108 extending from an upper contact pad 109 and seven fingers such as 110 extending from a lower contact pad 111. Adjacent finger pairs 108 110 have λ 2 spacing between centres. In operation, the upper contact pad 109 carries the rf signal and the lover contact pad is earthed. The blooming reflector banks 105 and 106 are separated by λ 4 from a periodic continuation of the respective rungs 101 and 102. The centres 112 and 113 of the rungs 101 and 102 have a mid point indicated by a chain line 114. A further chain line 115 indicates the centre of the unidirectional reflector bank 103, and is separated or offset from inter rung mid point 114 by λ 8. The section 100 has both unidirectional and antireflection properties, and may have as many rungs and associated unidirectional and blooming reflectors as may be required for individual applications. The use of blooming reflectors are an alternative to split fingers shown in Figure 4, which are difficult to produce for operation above 500 MHz where the λ 8 width is less than 1 µm. An attraction of the arrangement of Figure 9 is that In the examples hereinbefore described, reflection of acoustic waves at transducer fingers have either been ignored for convenience Figures 1 and 2 , or disposed of by split finger transducers Figures 4 and 7 or blooming Figure 9 . Referring now to Figure 10 and also to Figure 2, consider acoustic wave A indicated by arrow 36 propagating from transducer rung of finger group 16₁ to rung 16₂. Wave A will be partially reflected to form a wave not shown in Figure 2 travelling from rung 16₂ to rung 16₁. Similarly, wave C will be partially reflected at rung 16₁ to form a wave travelling towards rung 16₂. The rungs 16₁ and 16₂ have equal numbers of equally reflecting fingers 14 and 15, and the two partial reflections are in phase by symmetry. Accordingly, the partial reflections may be described by a single vector Waves B and D reflected by reflector strip 20 are described by vectors It is possible to combine the effects of blooming and directional reflectors to simplify design. To do this, the offset λ 8 must be changed to an offset λ 8 δ. Consider a two rung transducer having M fingers per rung and an inter rung reflector array having N strips, where N is greater than M. The fingers of the rungs 16₁ and 16₂ generate respective reflections It is assumed as a very good approximation that the reflection is small at each finger or reflector strip, so that each successive reflection leaves the transmitted amplitude substantially unaltered. This simplifies summing the reflected contributions, and does not affect the result substantially. To provide a reflector strip arrangement which provides blooming and unidirectionality, the vectors Accordingly, a ladder transducer of the invention having M fingers per rung will have both blooming and unidirectional properties if it incorporates reflector arrays having N strips, where N M, the strips are dimensionally equivalent to the overlapping finger portions and the strips are offset by λ 8 λϑ 4π ϑ arcsin M N from spatially periodic continuations of the transducer finger patterns. Whereas the above discussion relates to a two rung transducer, it applies similarly to transducers having any number of rungs. The advantage of this and the previous arrangement using blooming is that all transducer and reflector fingers have widths λ 4, which facilitates production. Transducers of the invention may be employed as described in filters, particularly in so called front end filters receiving antenna signals directly. This would reduce in band spurious signals in IF mixer stages from cross products between the local oscillator frequency and various unwanted received signals in other bands. Moreover, they may be used as IF filters provided that the relevant transducer design were to be of appropriate bandwidth. Mobile communications typically require 1 MHz bandwidth, for which the performance shown in Figure 8, curve a , is adequate. However, some applications require larger fractional bandwidths, for which a different design would be needed. At IF, this would allow fewer amplifier stages because of the low insertion loss characteristics of the invention. Moreover, the low insertion loss and linear group delay properties are of importance for use in oscillators such as the quartz crystal variety. Low insertion loss results in oscillations sustainable by one transistor, instead of two or more in the prior art, and linear group delay provides linear frequency modulation avoiding spurious sidebands a familiar problem in the prior art. The low insertion loss property is particularly relevant to applications in which low power consumption and hence minimum amplification is important, such as battery powered devices. The examples hereinbefore described have been shown with identical reflector banks with λ 8 offset, or the equivalent for the arrangement described with reference to Figure 11 and providing both for blooming and unidirectionality. In practice, transducers may require special properties. These may be provided for example by the following In each case, transducer response may be calculated by a vector diagram related to that described with reference to Figure 11.
