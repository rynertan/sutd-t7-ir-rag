## Description
Uhis invention relates to a self copying paper, particularlyfor composing printed forms and other prints arranged in multiple stacked sheets. As is knovm, the term self copying paper covers all those paper materials intended for the production of printea forms or other prints, as pre arrangea in the form of two or more stacked sheets which have been so treated as to result, under the application of localized pressure, in the impression of writings or any other graphic symbols being transferred in a condition of total readability to the front or upper side of all the sheets in the stack self copying paper differs from ordinary carbon paper in that a green sheet shows in practice no discoloration with respect to an untreated sheet. Self copying paper is constructed such as to present a covering layer on the back side thereof commonly defined CB side and a covering or coating on the upper or front side thereof commonly defined CFt side . In practice, a form comprising a stack of sheets in mutual overlapping relation ship is so composed as to have the first or uppermost sheet with its front side untreated, thus constituting the original , and the back side of the last or lovzermost sheet untreated, the intermediate sheets having both their sides treated, respectively with a IloFit and 7CB coating. According to the latest and most widely accepted practice, the transfer effect id obtained through the utilisation of so called microcapsules. These.mic rocapsules contain a given amount of a color ing matter hereinafter called toner, which is in a clear or colorless so called leuco state, in order for the layer including such microcapsules to be cor respondingly clear or colorless the toner, however, is adapted to become activated or developed, thereby it acquires the desired color and imparts the desired visibility to the symbollorwriting being transferred onto the paper, by a compound or substance which is present in the layer composition facing the one includ ing the microcapsules,whi ch upon manual or mechanical writing are in practice ruptured to allow the toner in leuco form out. he use of microcapsules, while of widespreaa application in the production of self copying paper, is not devoid of shortcomings, inasmuch as it requires special arrangements during the application of the layer containing the microcapsules and involves the use of a laminar air jet method to prevent incidental pressures, such as may occur during the application of the microcapsules onto the paper, from creating regions where an undesired color may appear already prior to the utilization of the printed forms themselves on the other hand, that method permits no local area treatment. Furthermore, the preparation of the layer containing the micro capsules is considerably expensive owing to the very presence of the micro capsules, and not always results in a product having a durable stability and an acceptable stability toward temperature variations. Another drawback is that, in the majority of cases, it is necessary to utilize, for the paper material backing layer, papers which have already undergone surface treatments in order to prevent the migration of toner from one side of that sheet to the other moreover, it generally happens that this type of paper has a relatively high thickness, which hinders the composition of forms vath a high number of stacked sheets. This invention sets out to eliminate the problems encountered in the past by providing a self copying paper which allows ordinary paper, such as is normally available from the paper industry, to be used which, after the treatment, is still quite thin and, therefore, suitable for the production of a high number of transfer copies. Within that general aim, it is a further object of the invention to provide a self copying paper which can be manufactured by means of reduced size and cost apparatus, that is such as ean be advantageously utilized by organizations and shops where form paper is printed prior and or subsequently to the deposition of the layers on the sheet sides. It is another object of this invention to provide a sclf copying paper wherein the application of the front and back layers is only allowed at predetermined areas of the sheet, to thus render self copying joust those portions which actually require to be so treated. The application operation, as mentioned, can be carried out at the printing shop which, by virtue of a continuous cycle operation, is advantageously enabled to produce forms printed in several colors and sensitized for self copying at selected portions thereof. A not unimportant object of this invention is to provide a self copying paper which affords transfer copies capable of successfully withstanding ageing to sunlight and of resisting fading upon wetting. These and other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a self copying paper, particularly for composing printed forms and other prints arranged in multiple stacked sheets,according to the invention, characterized in that it comprises, on the back side thereof, a thermoplastic matrix in which there is dissolved or partly dissolved and partly dispersed a toner in the leuco form, and on the front side thereof, a uniform layer including a developer agent for developing said toner in the leuco form, said toner on the back side of one sheet being adapted to be transferred to the front side of the next underlying sheet by application of localized pressure and developed thereon by said developer agent contained on the front side of said next underlying sheet. Further details will become more clearly apparent from the following detailed description of some preferred embodiments of the self copying paper according to the invention. The back or CB layer which contains the toner in the leuco form comprises a thermoplastic matrix which is a microcystalline wax matrix, a solvent of the toner which is compatible with said wax matrix, the whole having a melting point higher than 600C and preferably in the 80 to 1100C range understandably, the toner or mixture of toners in the leuco form will then be added, preferably dispersed through the mass. The high melting point is necessary in order to obtain a product which does not develop any unpleasant greasy feel when touched, even in the hottest climates and regions of the earth. Absolute compatibility, at least for the massive utilization ratios of wax matrix to solvent for the solid state toner, is a strict requirement in preventing solvent migration phenomena. The use of a microcristalline wax matrix imparts to the layer an optimum feel quality and prevents a premature showing of the color as due to rubbing against the underlying sheet which is moated with a toner developer or activating agent constituting the layer OFt . The copy obtained with that back layer is resistant to water and photo oxidation, since the reacted toner remains protected by the waxy product itself, which is insoluble in water and forms a good sun radiation screen. It will be apparent how such a wax matrix must be susceptible to micro rupture under the mechanical action of a ballpoint pen or type writing machine, which apply a localized pressure, such as to be transferred to the toner displaying layer or CF layer. All these properties are achieved by employing as the waxy carrier high melt microcrystalline paraffinic waxes or synthetic waxes of the Fischer Tropsch type or solid chloro paraffines which, owing to their chemical inertia saponification number, O , do not react with commercially available leuco toners, not even in their molten condition. It is also contemplated that natural waxes may be used, such as montan and carnauba, or synthetic ones, such as S wax or OP wax, although the results to be obtained thereby, as relates to transparency and colorlessness of the layer, are inferior to those to be obtained through the use of synthetic waxes which only comprise carbon and hydrogen, or carbon, hydrogen and chlorine.As toner solvents, cwroro paraffine,1,2, diphenylethane, esters of phtalic acid, partly hydrogenated triphenyls, esters of salicylic acid, can be used either singly or in combination. The leuco toners which can be utilized are those normally indicated in the pertinent literature, such as crystal violet lactone a compound of triarylmethane , blue of N benzoyl leucomethylene a compound of thiazine , and others, such as derivatives of xanthene e.g., rodamine B anilinelactame , spirodipyrane, and others. The percentages by weight of the various components are normally within the following ranges of values I 50 80 microcrystalline wax leuco toners 1 3 7 Vo toner solvents 10 30 . ., Inert inorganic fillers may also be added, such as calcium carbonate or urea formaldheyde resins, to vary the degree of whiteness and the opacity of the product. A particularly preferred composition is the following Example 1Fischer Tropsch microcrystalline wax 65 average molecular weight, 700 Crystal violet lactone 5Chloro paraffine amount in Cl 45 20Calcium carbonate 10 100 Another formulation having a high rate of toner development is the following Example 2Fischer Tropsch microcrystalline wax 40 average molecular weight, 700 Crystal violet lactone t, 5 1 , 2 diphenylethane 15 Urea formaldehyde resin 5 Zicrocrystalline paraffine, 35 refined melting point, 75 80 C 100 The products utilized to form the CB layer of Examples 1 and 2 should be applied to the paper at a temperature ranging from 100 to 120 C, in which range falls the most suitable viscosity value for the application. On the front side of the sheet, there is provided a uniform layer, or r CF layer, including a developing agent for the toner in the leuco form.The displaying layer or WCF layer differs from those mentioned in the pertinent patent literature mainly because it employs, as the primary developing agent, micronized silicas of high purity i.e. with a SiO2 content exceeding 95So, and preferably higher than 98 and above , obtained by pyrohydrolysis silicon tetrachloride. The extraordinary specific surface area of those silicas makes them compounds of exceptional reactivity, also but not exclusively, in combination with zinc chloride, which acts as a catalyst for the oxidoreduction reaction involved in the development of color. Since the use of high purity silicas, notwithstanding their ability to develop the color instantaneously, is not sufficient to ensure durability of the color brilliance, it becomes necessary to employ, as secondary developers, phenolic products such as phenol formaldehyde resins in particular the ones prepared by poly condensation of p phenyl phenol and formaldehyde , diphenylolpropane, and esters of 3,4,5 trioxybenzoic acid. For the application of such products, a liquid phase must be made available wherein the developing agents are dissolved and or dispersed. That liquid phase comprises essentially ketones, alcohols, alcoholethers, Particularly effective being the acetone methanol pair which, having a high evaporation rate ,allows the product to be applied by means of a machinery of comparatively small size and low cost, including a drying system with a length of 2 to 3 meters, adequate to evaporate the solvent while having an output rate which reach 200 to 250 m minute. In order for the product spread onto the paper to be perfectly anchored thereto and to show no indications of inconsistency to the touch, it is necessary to introduce in the formulations suitable amounts of synthetic resins effective to improve the adhesion of the layer to the front side, among such resins the use of cellulosic ethers being particularly advantageous. The presence of silica, colloidally dispersed in the solvents, and the use of binders which are completely dissolved in the solvents, may raise the flash point of the product to values exceeding 219C, even when solvents are employed having per se a neatly lower flash point, such as methanol and acetone. The percentages of the dis ved and or dispersed solids ranges from 20 to 40 by weight of the product. The zinc chloride to silica ratio is in the 0.00 to 0.4M0 range. A further important feature is the use of high boiling solvents for the leuco toners which are retained by the silica owing to the strong oil absorbency that characterizes it. Such solvents, e.g. chloroparaffines, partly hydrogenated tri phenyl, esters of phtalic acid, favor and accelerate the color development process because, being preferably adsorbed by the silica, they favor its contact with the toner upon application of a localized mechttnical action or pressure which causes the CB product to separate locally and contact the ttOF layer it is known, indeed, that the color developing reaction occurs preferably in the liquid phase, that is with the toner dissolved. This explains the high effectiveness of the silica leuco toner solvent combination. Two preferred compositions for the CF layer are now given here below.

The forms or prints to be obtained with the self copying paper according to the invention have, as usual, the front side of the first or uppermost sheet untreated, and the back side of the last or lowermost sheet also untreated, whereas both sides of the intermediate sheets are treated, thereby upon application of a localized pressure as due to manual or mechanical writing, the back layer is transferred to the underlying front layer, thus producing a development of the toner in the leuco form, which in a very short time becomes visible. Therefore, it will be appreciated from the foregoing that the invention achieves its objects and in particular it should be noted that, by eliminating the microcapsules and replacing them in practice with a layer of a crystalline wax material, in addition to affording a drastic reduction of the production costs, the invention ensures a product of improved quality, both as regards the sharpness of the resulting copies, and stability in time. The invention as described is susceptible to numerous modifications and variations, all of which fall within the purview of the instant inventive concept. Moreover, all of the details may be replaced with other technically equivalent elements.
