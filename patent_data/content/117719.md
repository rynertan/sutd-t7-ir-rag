# Method of decoding an encoded video signal and a receiving apparatus for decoding the signal.

## Abstract
A video signal is encoded prior to broadcasting by invert ing portions of the signal about an encoding axis at a pre determined reference level. To enable the reference level to be determined accurately after the received signal has been re corded and played back using a VTR having a noise reduction circuit, two identification signals having the same level are in cluded in two consecutive horizontal periods of the signal, respectively. The level of the identification signal in the second horizontal period is unaffected by the noise reduction circuit. A decoding circuit detects the level of that identification signal and uses it to generate a decoding axis having the reference level. The decoding circuit at the receiver is thus able to accura tely restore the encoded signal by reinverting the inverted por tions about a decoding axis having the same level as the en coding axis.
