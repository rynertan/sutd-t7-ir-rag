# Method and apparatus for holographic processing.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for holographically processing optical signals in a fiber optic sensor system. In the present invention, holographic processors are utilized in various combinations with light sources, fiber optic transmission means, sensors and detectors to provide low cost, com pact, sensitive and accurate sensor systems. By means of the holographic processors of the present invention, the aforementioned sensor systems are used to monitor such physical parameters as temperature, pres sure, flow rate, and the like, and to provide output signal indications thereof that are compatible with digital receiving stations and immune to electro magnetic inter ference, hazardous atmosphere, and the inimical effects of inadvertent intensity variation due to equipment vibration and the like. In one typical embodiment, a pair of holographic pro cessors are employed in a color multiplex demultiplex sen sor system in which a first holographic processor is em ployed to color multiplex a sensor signal and a second holographic processor is employed to decode the color multiplexed signal into a binary pattern that is then trans mitted onto a set of photo detectors. In each of the embodiments of the invention disclosed, a unique geometrical orientation of a hologram is utilized to minimize spurious signal interference that would other wise hamper or totally preclude the holographic proces sing.
