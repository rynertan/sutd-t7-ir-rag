# Vortex shedding flowmeter circuit arrangements.

## Abstract
A circuit arrangement for a vortex shedding flowmeter generates an analog signal proportional to the vortex shedding frequency and a pulse signal which equals or is proportional to the vortex shedding frequency signal. More specifically, a vortex shedding frequency signal from a vortex sensor 10 is passed via a preamplifier 12 and a threshold detector 14 to a one shot 16 that generates fixed width pulses. An output 28 of the one shot 16 is directed to a pulse signal network 22 and a low pass filter 20 to produce the pulse signai and analog signal, respectively. A scaling or range selection counter can be provided between the pulse signal and an output stage for changing the effective range of measurement by dividing the shedding frequency by a selected and known number.
