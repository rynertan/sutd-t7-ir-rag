# HEAT RECOVERABLE EXTRUDED ARTICLES

## Abstract
A heat recoverable tubular composite article 4 com prising an inner layer 5 comprising a crosslinked elas tomeric polymeric material having a modulus at 100 el ongation at 20 C of about 40 to about 900 pounds per square inch and an outer layer 3 comprising a thermoplastic mat erial having a 2 secant modulus at 20 C of about 5,000 to about 100,000 pounds per square inch said composite article 4 being formed by coextrusion, having a direct bond bet ween said layers with a peel strength of at least 6 pounds per linear inch, and being in a radially expanded configuration, said thermoplastic outer layer 3 being capable of retaining the elastomeric inner layer 5 in an expanded configuration at ambient temperature and incapable of retaining the elas tomeric layer 5 in an expanded configuration at a tem perature above a predetermined temperature thereby per mitting the composite article 4 to recover to or toward its unexpanded configuration.
