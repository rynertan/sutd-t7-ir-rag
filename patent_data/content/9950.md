## Description
BLOCK COPOLYMER HOT MELT ADHESVIE COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF FILLING A CAVITY The present invention relates to a hot melt adhesive composition, to a method of filling voids with the adhesive composition and to articles filled or coated with the hot melt adhesive composition. More particularly, it refers to block copolymers containing glass fibers and a particulate mineral reinforcing agent, to a method of filling voids with such compositions and to articles, filled or coated with the compositions. Hot melt adhesives are well known in the prior art.These materials are conveniently applied to a substrate in the molten state and upon cooling form an adhesive bond. However, a deficiency common to. most of the hot melt adhesiwsof the prior art is their tendency to soften and flow at elevated temperatures, as, for example, 70 to 1000C. with a resulting loss of bond strength. Consequently, these materials are not suitable for use over a broad temperature range. Attempts to upgrade the softening and flow temperatures have involved using very high molecular weight resinous materials and or crosslinking of the resin. These methods have resulted in materials with higher softening points and flow temperatures. However, in most cases the resulting material was not adapted to thermal processing because its higher molecular weight and or crosslinked structure engendered extremely high application viscosity. Thus these materials were not suitable for use as hot melt adhesives. In the manufacture and repair of metal bodies such as automobiles and appliances, solder compositions containing lead are frequently used to fill cavities and voids. These lead solders are extremely dense and can add a significant increment to the weight of the metal body. They present a health hazard which mandates special handling to protect workers engaged in the soldering and cavity filling operations.Curable adhesives such as epoxies are generally unsatisfactory for such cavity and void filling applications because they require careful metering of the components to provide good physical properties and bond strength, because they take too long to cure to a sandable state and because they have rather poor weather resistance.Conventional hot melt adhesives are also unsatisfactory for cavity and void filling applications because they cannot be sanded rapidly at assembly line speed, they do nto readily accept paint, exhibiting bleed throug , and they do not withstand the high temperatures necessary for the subsequent cure of paint overcoats, Bleed through or telegraphing is the term used to describe the revelation of difference in composition of the substrate when it has been painted, caused by a difference in reflectivity between the painted metal and the painted adhesive composition. U.S. Patent 3,650,999 discloses block copolymer comprising hard polyester segments and soft polyamide segments having improved adhesion and high temperature performance obtained by reacting a crystalline polyester, a C18 to C54 polycarboxylic acid and a primary diamine. This poly ester amide in common with other hot melt adhesives has deficiencies in creep resistance at temperatures above 1500C, in the range up to 205be, and above and in shrinkage when the hot melt is cooled to room temperature after application.These deficiencies have been covercome to a considerable degree by incorporating a metal powder into the block copolymer to yield a cavity filling composition which possesses good.sandability and paint acceptance. However, the metal powder copolymer composition can lack adequate impact resistance especially at low temperatures and can sag excessively at elevated temperatures. Attempts to improve the impact resistance by introducing an energy absorbing rubber reinforcement were generally unsuccessful and added a further complication of blinding of the sanding disc, making sanding extremely difficult. The present invention is directed to an adhesive composition of improved impact resistance at low temperatures, which is less dense and toxic than lead solder, forms a strong bond to metal and painted metal substrates, withstands extremes of humidity and temperature, has sag resistance at elevated temperatures, is readily trowelled to fill a cavity, sets rapidly to a sandable state, is easily sanded smooth and accepts paint without bleed throught , The adhesive composition comprises a block copolymer, a particulate mineral reinforcing agent and glass fiber wherein the block copolymer is selected from the group consisting of copolyesters, copolyamides, copoly esteramides and copoly ether esters melting at a temperature of at least about 1500C., having from about 30 to about 70 weight percent of hard segments and from about 70 to about 30 weight percent of soft segments, wherein the weight ratio of block copolymer to aluminum powder and glass fiber is in the range of about 3 7 to about 3 2, wherein the weight ratio of block copolymer to glass fiber is at least about 3 4 and wherein the weight ratio of particulate mineral reinforcing agent to glass fiber is in the range of about 1 3 to about 9 1. Another aspect of the invention is directed to substrates coated or filled with the adhesive composition and yet another aspect is directed to a method of filling a cavity in a substrate which comprises applying the adhesive composition as a hot melt to fill the cavity, cooling the adhesive composition below the crystallization temperature of the block copolymer and sanding the adhesive composition to provide a surface even with the surrounding substrate. The block copolymer of the adhesive compositions of the present invention is selected from the group consisting of copolyesters, copolyamides, copoly ester amides and copoly ether esters melting at a temperature of at least about 1500C., having hard segments and soft segments to provide a balance of physical properties and processability. These segments are considered to exist in microscopic domains within the bulk mass of copolymer resin to provide a heterephase system in which the copolymer will have physical properties reflecting the properties which the respective segments would manifest independently, By control of the relative size, proportions, crystallinity and crystal melting points of the segments, the tack, open time and bond strength of the adhesive can be controlled.The hard segments contribute crystalline blocks to the copolymer so that optimum bulk physical properties such as tensile strength an l stiffness can be achieved without incurring the disadvantage of high processing viscosity. The hard or crystalline segments can be polyester or polyamide of weight average molecular weight of from about 400 to about 16,000 to ensure that the segment will contribute the optimum ordered structure to the final polymeric product.Polyesters and polyamides with a weight average molecular weight of less than about 400 have a short chain length and cannot contribute the necessary ordered structure to the final polymeric product which also comprises soft segments. Polyesters and polyamides with a weight average molecular weight of greater than about 16,000 may require excessive reaction times or temperatures to form the final block copolymer leading to degradation of the polymer and a subsequent loss in adhesive properties. To ensure that the final polymeric product has excellent thermal properties such as resistance to flow at elevated temperatures the melting point of the hard polyester or polyamide segment should be at least about 1800C. Preferably, the melting point is in the range of from 2000C.to 2700C. The hard or crystalline polyester segments of the block copolymer are condensed from at least one aliphatic or alicyclic diol having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and at least one alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 8 to 20 carbon atoms selected to give a melting point in the desired range. Representative examples of such acids are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, hexahydroterephthalic acid, the naphthalic acids, such as 2,6 , 2,7 , 2,8 , 1,5 and 1,4 naphthalene dicarboxylic acids and other such acids which form high melting polyester resins, Examples of glycols are ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, tetramethylene glycol, neopentylene glycol, 1,4 cyclohexane dol, 1,4 cyclohexane dimethanol and other such glycols.High melting polymers containing components such as 2,2 dimethylpropane diol, form polyesters which have melting points above 2340C. Mixtures of the foregoing polyesters can also be used, Preferably, a polyester from the following group can be used to provide the hard segments of the block copolymer Poly ethylene terepthalate isophthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly ethylene hexamethylene terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly ethylene neopentylene terephthalate, 100 0 to 75 25 Poly tetramethylene terephthalate isophthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly tetramethylene hexamethylene terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 Poly tetramethylene neopenty.lene terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 PolyCethylene propylene terephthalate , 100 0 to 60 40 and Poly tetramethylene 2,6 naphthalate terephthalate , 100 0 to 75 25 etc. When the hard polyester segments comprise polyethylene terephthalate, the molecular weight range corresponds to an inherent viscosity range of about 0.05 to about 0.7 determined at 259C. with a solution of 0,5 g 100 ml in a solvent pair consisting of phenol and sym tetrachloroethane in the weight ratio of 60 40, The hard or crystalline polyamide segments of the block copolymer can be condensed from at least one aliphatic or alicyclic diamine having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic or alicyclic dicarboxylic acid having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms selected to provide a polyamide with a melting point in the desired range. Examples of diamines include ethylene diamine, 1,3 propane diamine, 1,4 butane diamine,i, 5 pentane diamine, hexamethylene diamine, 1,10decanediamine, cyclohexanediamine, etc.Examples of acids include oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic and sebacic acids. The hard or crystalline polyamide segments of the block copolymer can be obtained by polymerization of LLLaminocarboxylic acids containing from 2 to 10 carbon atoms such as aminoaceti act , 3 aminopropionic acid, 4 aminobutyric acid, 6 aminohexoic acid, 10 aminodecanoic acid, etc. Polymerization of lactams such as caprolactam provides a route to several of such polyamides.Among the preferred polyamides are poly hexamethylene adipamide and poly caprolactam . The soft, amorphous or low melting eg..,ents of the block copolymer contribute wettability, elasticity and rubber character to the copolymer, They can be polyester, poly ether ester or polyamide and are generally of weight average molecular weight in the range of about 300 to about 16,000 and possess a glass transition temperature less than about 500C.and more preferably in the range of about 30 to about 400C. The soft polyester segments of the block copolymer can be condensed from an aliphatic or alicyclic diol having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms and an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms selected to provide a polyester with a glass transition temperature in the desired range. They can be formed by reacting a polylactone diol of number average molecular weight in the range of about 350 to 6000 with an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms.Poly ether ester segments can be prepared by condensing a poly alkylene ether glycol of number average molecular weight in the range of about 350 to 6000 in which the alkylene groups have from 2 to 10 carbon atoms with an aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms.Polyamide segments can be prepared by condensing an aliphatic or alicyclic diamine having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms with a mixture of an aliphatic or alicyclic dicarboxylic acid having from 4 to 54 carbon atoms and at least 40 weight percent of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having from 18 to 54 carbon atoms. The block copolymers are prepared by a one step or two step method. In the one step method the components which form the hard or soft segments are polymerized in the presence of a prepolymer of the soft or hard segments respectively. In the two step method the hard segments and soft segments are prepared separately as prepolymers and then condensed together. The preferred block copolymer component of the present invention contains about 30 to about 70 percent by weight of hard segments and conversely about 70 to about 30 percent by weight of soft segments. It is further characterized as having a weight average molecular weight in the range of about 5500 to about 30,000, more preferably in the range of about 8000 to about 20,000 for an optimal balance of physical properties and processability. The melting point of the copolymer com ponent is above about 1500C. and IS preferably in the temperature range of about 155 to about 2250C. for ease of processing without degradation of the copolymer.The glass. transition temperature associated with the soft segments of the copolymer is generally less than about 500C. and is preferably in the range of about 30 to 400C. to contribute wettability, elasticity, and rubber character to the copolymer, The melting point and glass transition temperature are conveniently determined with a duPont differential thermal analyzer Model DTA 900 with the scanning calorimeter attachment, employing a 5 to 25 mg sample heated at a rate of 200 per minute, in a nitrogen atmosphere.The melt viscosity of the copolymer at 2320C. is preferably less less than 150,000 centipoise at a shear rate of 4 sec and is preferably in the range of about 25,000 to 100,OCO centirc,se. The most preferred group of block copolymers are block copoly ester amides of the type described in U, S. Patent 3,650,999. They comprise hard segments of polyester as described hereinabove, and soft segments of polyamide formed by condensing a C18 to C54 dicarboxylic acid and a C2 to C10 aliphatic or alicyclic primary diamine. The dicarboxylic acids include the dimer acids 1 from dimerization of unsaturated aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, e.g., linoleic acid, available commercially as mixtures of monobasic, dibasic and tribasic acids containing up to 10 weight percent of monobasic and tri basic acids. The aliphatic or alicyclic diamines include ethylene diamine, 1,3 propane diamine, 1,4 butanediamine, 1,5 pentane diamine, hexamethylene diamine, 1,10 decane diamine, cyclohexanediamine,2,2 dimethyl 1,3 propane diamine, etc. Optionally up to 60 percent by weight of a linear aliphatic dibasic acid having from 4 to 17 carbon atoms may be substituted for a corresponding amount of the C18 to C54 polycarboxylic acid used to prepare the soft polyamide segments of the polyesteramlde. Examples of these acids include oxalic, succinic, adipic, pimelic, suberic, azelaic, sebacic, dodecanedioic and thapsic acids. The advantage of substituting the Cq to C17 acids for the C18 to C54 acids is to provide a more heterogeneous character to the polyamide segments of the polymer and to modify the glass transition temperature. The second component of the adhesive composition is a finely divided particulate mineral reinforcing agent added to improve the creep resistance of the block copolymer and the sandability. It may be of average particle size in the range of about 0.2 micron to about 150 microns and is preferably of average particle size in the range of about 1 to about 50 microns. The particulate mineral reinforcing agent is preferably granular with an aspect ratio of about 10 or less and even more preferably, the particles are rounded and relatively rree of sharp edges, and have an average aspect ratio less than about 4, especially when the adhesive composition is used for cavity filling since such a particulate mineral reinforcing agent allows the hot melt composition to be readily smoothed and burnished when it is sanded. In addition to improving the creep resistance and sandability of the adhesive composition, the particulate mineral reinforcing agent allows longer working time or longer open time between application of the hot melt and closing of the bond and higher green strength or faster onset of bond strength, and reduces the degree of shrinkage of the adhesive composition when it is cooled from the hot melt temperature to ambient temperature. The particulate mineral reinforcing agent can be selected from a wide variety of minerals used for reinforcement of condensation polymers. It is preferably selected from the group consisting of anhydrous inorganic oxides such as alumina, silica and titanium oxides, and anhydrous silicates such as wollastonite, mullite, garnet and calcined clay. Particularly preferred are silicas of the type sold by Malvern Minerals Company under the registered trademark Novacite , and calcined clay. When the adhesive composition comprises only the block copolymer and the particulate mineral, the impact re .sistance tends to be low particularly at low temperatures such as 300C. and the molten composition tends to sag at the elevated temperatures at which it is applied. Addition of glass fiber as the third component of the adhesive composition improves the impact resistance at low temperatures, reduces the tendency of the adhesive composition to sag at elevated temperatures and permits greater latitude in overcoming shrinkage and minimizing coefficient of expansion differences with the substrate. The glass fiber is of the type conventionally used for reinforcement of thermoplastic resins. It is preferred to use relatively soda free glasses comprising lime aluminum borosilicate glass such as types C and 11t glass.The glass fiber is preferably in the form of milled fibers or chopped fibers of average length in the range of about 1 32 inch 0.8 mm to about 1 4 ich 6.4 mm and longer and of diameter in the range of about 2 to about 20 microns. The preferred average length is in the range of about 1 16 inch 1.6 mm to about 1 4 inch 64 mm . The inorganic components of the adhesive composition may optionally be treated with an effective amount of. coupling agent by methods well known to those skilled in the art before or while being blended into the block copolymer, Such coupling agents include organosilane coupling agents exemplified by triethoxy vinylsilane, vinyl methyl dichlorosilane, 2 tri me.hoxysilyl ethyl methacrylate, 3 amno l trethoxysilyl propane, etc. organotitanium coupling agents such as the alkyl alkanoyl titanates exemplified by C1 to C40 alkyl stearyl titanates fatty acids exemplified by oleic and stearic acid fatty amides exemplified by oleamide and stearamide and chromium compounds exemplified by methacrylato chromic chloride.These coupling agents can cause a significant reduction in the melt viscosity of the blend, can improve the wetting and dispersion of the inorganic ccmponents i.e the particulate mineral and the glass fiber and can enhance the physical properties of the adhesive composition, The ratio of the three components of the adhesive composition is selected so that the desired balance of flow and workabilityçadhesion, sag resistance, impact resistance ad sandability is achieved.Excessive amounts of the inorganic components should be avoided since they can contribute to very high melt viscosity, cause poor workability as manifested by the difficulty with which the composition can be spread or trowelled and feathered onto a substrate and decrease the adhesion of the adhesive composition to the substrate. It is therefore, preferred to select the components so that the weight ratio of block copolymer to inorganic components, i.e.to the sum of particulate mineral and glass fiber, is in the range of about 3 7 to about 3 2 and is preferably in the range of about 1 2 to about 1 1 the weight ratio of block copolymer to glass fiber is at least about 3 4 and is preferably in the range of about 1 1 to about 5 1 and the weight ratio of particulate mineral to glass fiber is in the range of about 1 3 to about 9 1 and is preferably in the range of about 1 2 to about 3 1. The component ratios are preferably selected so that the melt viscosity of the hot melt composition is preferably less than about 300,000 centipoise and preferably less than about 150,000 centipoise, at a temperature of 2500C. and l a shear rate of 4 sec measured in a Brookfield Thermocel Unit Model HBT.When the melt viscosity is above 300,000 centipoise, the hot melt is difficult to apply and spread, and tends to be dragged from the point of application. The hot melt composition is formed by mixing the particulate mineral and the glass fiber with the melted polymer in any convenient way such as by melt blending in a blenderextruder. A good mix is considered to have been obtained if the filler particles are evenly distributed through the melt. In poor mixes, the filler particles are not adequately wet by the melt, and tend to be unevenly distributed, remaining aggregated within the melt, Melt stability of the mix is determined by maintaining the mix at 2160C for two hours. Sf the melt viscosity changes less than 10 percent during this time, the mix is considered to have melt stability. Creep resistance of te compositions of the present invention is determined by observing the.sag of a 10 to l5 gram sample ot the composition placed on an aluminum plane inclined at 600 to the vertical. The observations are carried out at 1750 and 2050C. Creep or sag in less than 60 minutes at the designated temperature is recorded as a failure to meet the test. Impact strength is determined by applying the composition as a hot melt at 5000F. 2600C. to a smooth steel panel 7.5 cm X 22.5 cm to provide a strip 4 cm wide and in the range of 25 to 250 microns thick. The panels are conditioned for 24hoursat 300C. One lb. 454 g steelballs are dropped onto the strip of composition from heights of 18 inch 46 cm and 36 inch 92 cm . The impact is repeated three times at 15 minute intervals. If chipping or cracking of the composition or separation from the steel panel occurs, the composition is considered to have failed the test. Similar test panels are prepared for testing of the sandability of the composition. In the preparation of the panels, the ease of flow of the hot melt composition is observed and its ability to be spread or trowelled to provide a smooth cohesive strip is noted. The panel is cooled to room temperature and a disc sander, 12.5 cm. diameter, with 80 grit medium tungsten carbide abrasive, is applied to the composition at 1000 rpm to smooth and feather the composition.If the surface of the composition becomes smooth enough to accept paint without telegraphing or showing a difference in reflectivity between the painted steel and the painted composition, and without blinding or blocking the abrasive surface of the sander, the composition is rated sandable. Depending upon the particular substrate and especially when the substrate is bare metal, it can be advantageous to apply a primer coat to improve the adhesion of the hot melt composition. Suitable primers include the commercially available primer coatings, and the etherified methylolmelamines described in U.S. Patent 4,053,682. Also suitable, can be organic solvent solutions and aqueous dispersions of the block copolymer component of the hot melt adhesive composition. The hot melt adhesive compositions of the present invention find widespread utility in a wide variety of applications. They are especially valuable in those applications where resistance to creep at elevated temperatures is a necessary requirement. The adhesive compositions of the present invention may be used to great advantage to bond a variety of substrates including metal, glass, synthetic and natural textiles, leathers, synthetic polymeric sheet material, wood, paper, etc, The present invention also includes the concept of incorporating various ingredients into the adhesive composition to improve process ing and or performance of these materials. These additives and adjuncts include antioxidants, thermal stabilizers, extenders, dyes, pigments, adhesion promoters, plasticizers, etc. The following examples are set forth in illustration of the invention and should not be construed as a limitation thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLE l A block copolymer which is approximately 65 percent by weight crystalline polyethylene terephthalate segments and 35 percent by weight amorphous polyamide made from dimer acid and hexamethylene diamine, is prepared in two steps.. In the first step 157,5 parts 0.272 mol of a C36 dibasic acid and 30.8 parts 0.266 mol of hexamethylene diamine are charged to a reaction vessel and heated with agitation at about 2150C.for one hour to form a polyamde resin. During the first 30 minutes the pressure rises to 1000 kPa after which time the reaction vessel is vented to reduce the pressure to 600 kPa.At the end of one hour the pressure is released and 332 parts of a crystalline polyethylene terephthalate M.P. 260 C. inherent viscosity 0.147 and 7.5 parts 0.095 mol of ethylene glycol are charged to the vessel along with a minor amount of an antioxidant. The vessel is flushed with nitrogen and the mixture is heated to about 2800C. while maintaining a nitrogen pressure of 240 kPa. After 0.5 hour the vessel is vented and vacuum applied and the reaction is continued under full vacuum 0.1 to 5 mm. of mercury for two hours. At the end of this time the resulting molten poly ester amide is discharged under pressure into a water bath to quench the material. The polymer obtained melts at 205 C. and the inherent viscosity is 0.50. A filled composition of block copolymer, particulate mineral and glass fiber in the weight ratio of 50 45 5 is prepared by the following procedure. To a stainless steel reactor fitted with an anchor agitator and a jacketed hot oil heating system is added 100 parts by weight of the poly ester amide and heating is begun.When the contents have reached 250BC.,lagitation is begun at 60 rpm and 100 parts by weight of a mixture of a silanated silica sold by Malvern Minerals Company under the registered trademark Novacup L207A of average particle size 4 micron and milled glass fiber of average length 1 16 inch 1.59 mm is fed into the mass at a rate of 10 parts by weight per minute. The agitation is continued and the temperature is raised to 2660C. under a nitrogen blanket. Agitation is con tin.ued for 15 minutes after the addition of the mixture is complete and the molten mass is discharged under slight N2 pressure 250 kPa , quenched in a bath, ground and redried.This material is used as a hot melt to fill dents and orifices in a metal plate. After application it is cooled to room temperature, sanded smooth with 80 grit tungsten carbide abrasive and painted with an automotive surface coating. No telegraphing is observed. The filled adhesive composition is excellent in flow at 2600C., is spread or trowelled well, and passes the 18 in.lb. and 36 in.lb. impact tests at 300C. EXAMPLES 2 12 Adhesive compositions are prepared in the manner set forth in Example 1 with the various weight percentages of copolymer and with various weight ratios of particulate mineral to glass fiber. The compositions are evaluated for flow at 2600C., workability, impact strength and sandability. The data are presented in Table 1. Lap bond tensile strengths of the compositions of Examples 8 and 10, determined by ASTM test method D 1002 72, are respectively 171 and 165 kg cm TABLE 1COPOLYESTERAMIDE HOT MELT COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING SILICA AND GLASS FIBERImpact Test 30 C.Weight Weight Ratio Flow at 18 in.lbs. 36 in.lbs.Example Copolymer Mineral Glass 250 C.
