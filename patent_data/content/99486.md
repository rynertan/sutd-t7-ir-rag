# Diamond single crystals, a process of manufacturing and tools for using same.

## Abstract
An artificial diamond single crystal, a process for producing it, and tools for utilizing it are disclosed. The artificial diamond crystal has at least one surface which has a rough surface formed by suppressed crystal growth at that surface. The single crystal is produced by providing a diamond synthesis reaction system comprised of a reaction chamber, a carbon source 3 and a solvent metal 8 arranged in contact with the carbon source 3 . A seed crystal 1 is provided in the reaction chamber under elevated pressures and temperatures which permit diamond to be maintained thermodynamically stable. The reaction system is heated to provide a temperature gradient in such a way that a portion of the solvent metal 8 in contact with the carbon source 3 is higher in temperature than a portion of the solvent metal 8 in contact with the seed crystal 1 . This temperature gradient causes a migration of the carbon from the higher temperature portion to the lower temperature portion using the solvent metal 8 as a medium. This allows the carbon to precipitate and grow as diamond on the seed crystal 1 due to the difference in solubility caused by the temperature gradient. The conditions in the reaction cham ber housing are maintained so as to suppress crystal growth in at least one direction perpendicular to the direction of the temperature gradient, at the end of the solvent metal 8 . The suppressed crystal growth provides the rough surface of the single crystal which can be connected to a tool and thus provides good adherence between the crystal and the tool.
