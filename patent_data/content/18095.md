# Turf maintenance machine.

## Abstract
In turf maintenance machines, lifting and lowering of e.g. cutter units and partial counterbalancing of such units in their working positions may be provided by hydraulically actuated means comprising at least one selector valve 1 , the or each valve having ports connected with at least one unit lifting ram 55 , a pump 17 , a reservoir 29 and an accumulator 48 . An operator can be certain that, when a unit is lowered to the ground, the required degree of partial counterbalance can be provided. In a preferred machine, the valve is a four position spool valve which in the lower position thereof permits discharge of fluid from a ram to the reservoir thereby lower ing an associated unit, whilst connecting the pump to charge the accumulator. When the unit reaches the ground the operator moves the valve to the counterbalance posi tion, thereby counterbalancing the unit to the required extent by connecting the ram to the accumulator.
