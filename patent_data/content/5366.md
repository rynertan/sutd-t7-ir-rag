# Toner head and toner clean off head for use in electrostatic printing.

## Abstract
A toner head for delivering liquid toner to a moving record medium carrying a latent electrostatic image, the toner being moved by vacuum pressure, requires lower sealing pressures than in the prior art thereby preventing excessive inward deflection of the record medium. The toner head 14 comprises a housing 24 having an inlet plenum 56 and an outlet plenum 58 for receiving fresh and depleted toner, respectively. Vacuum applied to the outlet plenum 58 moves the liquid toner. A manifold, formed as a series of modules 44i, 46e in one embodiment, communicates with both plenums to direct toner flow therebetween via image development zones located in the manifold. The manifold comprises a plurality of elongate, shallow channels 68 across which toner liquid flows in operation, the channels 68 being laterally bounded by a plurality of outwardly extending wear rails 72, 74, 76 and the outer side of the channels 68 being bounded by the record medium 10 resting on the rails 72, 74, 76 , so that several narrow toning zones are formed. The manifold modules 44i, 46e are formed of electrically conductive material so that their upper surfaces 47 function as counterelectrodes during the toning process. As viewed end on, the manifold modules and the wear rails collectively present a portion of a cylindrical surface over which the record medium is drawn during toning. Because of the cylindrical surface, an initial sealing pressure is provided by the wrap and tension of the record medium so that it conforms easily to the outer edges of the wear elements and other contacting lands, thereby ensuring good sealing engagement throughout the toning process, without requiring the application of high vacuum.
