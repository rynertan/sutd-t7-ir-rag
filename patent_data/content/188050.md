# Method for production of cellulolytic enzymes.

## Abstract
A method for the saccharification of a cellulosic material comprises the steps of culturing a microorganism of Acre monium cellulolyticus in a medium containing carbon sources and nitrogen sources, collecting a celluolytic en zyme from the resultant culture broth, and causing the cellulolytic enzyme to act on the cellulosic material.
