## Description
TITLE REMOVAL OF WATER FROM AQUEOUS CARBOXYLIC ACID STREAMS This invention relates to the removal of water from aqueous carboxylic acid streams, in particular where the acid is carboxylic acid is acrylic acid, to facilitate recovery of the acid. Acrylic acid is currently manufactured by the vapour phase catalytic oxidation of propylene or acrolein. The gaseous reactor effluent from this process contains about 10 GO wt. acrylic acid, with water, acetic acid and various organic impurities.Tliis stream is then condensed or absorded to obtain an aqueous solution of acrylic acid, acetic acid and water. Purification of this stream to obtain acrylic acid has been extremely difficult. Simple fractional distillation is not easy due to the relative volatility of acrylic acid, acetic acid and water. The prior art is replete with methods of removing water from this system. U.S Patent No.816,524 describes a method of separating acrylic acid from the aqueous solution. U.S. Patent No. 3,432,401 describes a method of using specific solvents as entrainers to aid in azeotropic distillation. Salts have also been used ill an attempt to concentrate the acrylic acid in this stream.U.S. Patent No. 2,922,815 discloses that calcium chloride, sodium sulfate, and dry metal salts such as nickel chloride and nickel bromide have been used as drying agents to concentrate the acrylic acid up to about 80 . U.S. Patent No, 3,846,488 discloses a method for accelerating the separation of an organic solvent phase from an aqueous phase obtained by the extraction of acrylic acid with a solvent by adding an alkali metal salt or ammonium salt in minute amounts to the aqueous solution. Addition of solvents or entrainer s has the disadvantage of requiring an additional step of separation and the use of salts has the disadvantage that large quantities are required or they are difficult to regenerate. We have now found that polyanhydrides are very effective in concentrating acrylic acid by removing water from an aqueous acrylic acid stream and avoid the disadvantages referred to above. The present invention provides a process for removing water from an aqueous carboxylic acid stream which comprises contacting said stream with a polyanh ydride. The invention also provides a process for removing water from an aqueous carboxylic acid stream comprising a contacting said aqueous stream with a polyaalhydride to remove water therefrom and to concentrate the carboxylic acid and b separating the concentrated carboxylic acid stream from the polyanhydride. Typical carboxylic acids useful in the present invention include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid.While the polyanhydride will remove water from an aqueous stream having any amount of carboxylic acid contained therein, it is preferred that the aqueous stream have at least 50 , preferably 80 and most preferably 95 concentration of acid. The present invention is thus extremely useful in the final purification steps for the production of a high purity acid. The polyanhydride can be any polyanhydride known in the art such as aromatic, heterocylic or aliphatic. Preferably the polyanhydride will have a minimum solubility in the carboxylic acid. The polyanhydride can be present in the polymer or co polymer form. For example, maleic anhydride may be polymerized to form a useful polyanhydride.An example of another anhydride that may be polymerized is citraconic anhydride. The polyanhydrides formed from two or more monomers to produce a co polymer can also be used in accordance with the present invention. It is well known in the art that some anhydrides will polymerize themselves while other anhydrides will require a co monomer to form a polyanhydride. It is preferred in the present invention that polyanhydride be a co polymer. Preferably the polyanhydride is a co polymer of maleic anhydride. The co monomer which is polymerised with maleic anhydride can be a monomer such as diisobutylene, dipropylene, styrene, indene, alpha methy lstyrene, etc, of an a ol efins such as propylene, isobutylene etc. The selection of the other monomer depends upon the size of the polyanhydride that is desired One of tie preferred monomers for polymerizing with maleic anhydride would be diisobutylene. In order to minimize solubility of the polyan hydiidc with the carboxylic acid, one may cross link the polyanhydride with a cross linking agent. For example, the pol yaiiijydride foiincd from maleic anhydride and diisobutylene will have some solubility in acrylic acid. However, when cross linking Wi tii an agent such as divinylbenzene, a more rigid polymeric structure is formed that becomes relatively insoluble to acrylic acid, yet still is reactive to water. Care must be taken in using a cross linking agent, however, for if a too rigid or cross linked structure is produced, it is also possible that the water removal capabilities of the polyanhydride will be reduced. Cross linking agents are known in the art and thus a detailed description is not necessary. However, it is preferred that cross linking agents have two or three double bonds in one molecule. Examples of such agents are trialkylcyanurate and 3, 9 divinyl 2,4,S,lO tetraoxaspiro 5,5 undecane. Once the polyanhydride has been produced, it may be contacted with the aqueous carboxylic acid stream by several different methods. Such methods may be by batch operation wherein the aqueous carboxylic acid and the polyanhydride are in a static condition in a vessel.The contacting process may also be continuous wherein the aqueous stream is passed over a bed of polyanhydride. In the continous process, after the polyanhydride has become saturated with water the stream can then be transferred to a second bed of fresh poly anhydridc while the first bed is regenerated. An advantage of the present invention is that water may be removed from an acid stream at relatively low temperatures. Temperatures of under 100 C can be used with the preferred temperatures being around 500C. The exact temperature of course, depends upon the polyanhydride being used and the initial concentration of acid in the aqueous stream. The amount of polyanhydride to be used can be cstimated once the desired polyanhydride has been selected. For example, tiie polyanhydride formed from maleic anijydri de and diisobutylene has one anhydride group per fonnula weight of polysc1 . Assuming that one formula weight of polyanhydride will react with one mole of water, and knowing tie initial concentration of acrylic acid, the amount of polyanhydride necessary to remove all the water can be calculated. The time necessary for extracting water from the aqueous stream, is of course the function of the initial concentration of the acid, and the effectiveness of the polyanhydride, and the temperature. The iollowing Examples illustrate the invention Examples 1 2 Fifty parts each of maleic anhydride and diisobutylene is stir mixed and refluxed under an atmosphere of nitrogen in a 2 litre 3 neck round bottom flask. Nitrogen was used since moisture and free oxygen are harmful to the reaction components. One part divinylbenzene was dissolvcd iii 200 parts toluene which served as a solvent. The solution was then injected continuously into tie flask via a syringe pump at a flow rate of approximately 5 cc minute. The reaction temperature was maintained at approximately 800C.After refluxing for seven hours, the white cross linked product obtained was blended and then washed with methanol. Finally, the product was dried at approximately 120 C overnight under vacuum. The polyanhydride was then placed in a soxhlet extraction apparatus. The apparatus was modified such tiiat all the reflux liquid from the condenser contacted the polyanhydride placed iiiside tiie thimble of the apparatus. The thimble was filled with approximately 7 grams of discrete polyanhydride particles. About 60 cc of concentrated crude acrylic acid was added to the soxhlet bottom pot.Hydroquinone was added to the crude acid liquid to give a concentrated of approxim ately 500 ppm in order to inhibit unwanted formation of acrylic acid polymer during the heated eNtraction process. TIie system was gradually evacuated and the liquid gently heated up to a temperature of 70 80 C.For Example 1, during reflux, the thimble was heated with an infrared lamp and maintained at approximately 55 C for approximately two hours. This time was extended for Example 2 to 221 hours. The results of these examples are shown in the Table. Example 3 Example 3 shows the polyanhydride of Example 1 being stri mixed with the acrylic acid solution in anErlenmeyer flask for 30 minutes. The liquid was then separated and analyzed. Examples 4 5 A second batch of maleic anhydride diisobutylene polyanhydride was made as per Example 1, except the divinylbenzene was in 200 parts of benzene rather than toluene. Example 4 shows the effect of using this polyanhydride in the process of Example 1. Example 5 sows the effect of regenerating polyanhydride. The spent polyanhydride from Example 4 was regenerated by vacuum heat treatment. Atter water and other volatiles were removed, the polyanhydride solid was ground up and reused. The results are shown in the Table. Table Coiicentrating Acrylic Acid Solutions With Maleic Anhydride Disolbutylene PolyanhydrideExample Temp. C Pressure Initial Wt. Final Wt.
