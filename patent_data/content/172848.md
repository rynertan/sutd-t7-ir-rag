## Description
This invention relates to an umbrella having a canopy, a frame of interconnected ribs connected to a collar and means for the automatic opening and closing of the umbrella, said means comprising a hollow outer cylinder provided with at least one slot extending therethrough along a portion of its length, said collar having at least one pin extending through said slot, said collar sliding along the exterior surface of said hollow outer cylinder, a handle attached to said hollow outer cylinder, an internal screw threadably inserted into a threaded nut and attached to a drive shaft of an electric motor being fixed to said hollow outer cylinder and connected to a battery, and a switch, which allows a flow of electricity. It is known in the art to construct umbrellas which open automatically with the manual release of a catch wherein the compression of a spring causes a hollow member, to which the ribs of the umbrella are attached, to move along a shaft extending through the hollow member. It is also known in the art to provide means for the biasing closed of the umbrella by springs. However, the umbrellas of the art in general require the movement of the hand from one position to another in order to effect closing or even worse require the use of two hands. These defects are coupled with a complexity of design which contributes to a high cost of manufacture. FR A 2 238 448 discloses an umbrella which automatically opens and closes by means of a motor and gear. However, the opening and closing of the umbrella cannot be handled in an easy way. It was the object of the present invention to provide an umbrella which can be open and closed with one hand without moving the hand from its normal position on the handle. According to the present invention an umbrella is provided having a canopy, a frame of interconnected ribs connected to a collar and means for the automatic opening and closing of the umbrella, said means comprising a hollow outer cylinder provided with at least one slot extending therethrough along a portion of its length, said collar having at least one pin extending through said slot, said collar sliding along the exterior surface of said hollow outer cylinder, a handle attached to said hollow outer cylinder, an internal screw threadably inserted into a threaded nut and attached to a drive shaft of an electric motor being fixed to said hollow outer cylinder and connected to a battery, a switch which allows a flow of electricity, known from FR A 2 238 448, that is characterized in that a hollow inner cylinder is located concentrically within said hollow outer cylinder, slidably moves therein and is attached to said collar via the pin, the threaded nut is attached to said hollow inner cylinder and the switch has a first position which allows a flow of electricity from the battery such that said shaft of said electric motor rotates in one direction which forces said canopy and ribs from the closed position to the open position and has a second position which allows the flow of electricity from the battery such that said shaft of said electric motor rotates in the other direction which returns the umbrella to the closed position. The presently disclosed umbrella device accomplishes both automatic opening, as accomplished by the previous art, but by a means different from that of the prior art and in addition discloses a means by which the automatic closing of the umbrella can be accomplished by a means not disclosed in the prior art . Novel mechanical means are used to allow the opening and closing of the umbrella without the need to move the hand from its normal position on the handle in the normal carrying position to either open or close the umbrella. Figure 1 illustrates in the closed position an umbrella according to the present invention. Figure 2 illustrates the opened position of the embodiment of Figure 1. Figure 3 contains an overhead view of the umbrella mechanism while in the open position. Figure 4 is a side view of Figure 1 showing a detail of the aforementioned modifications. Figure 1 depicts an umbrella according to the present invention in which the opening and closing of the umbrella is accomplished by the upward and downward movement of inner cylinder 79. In Figure 1 there can be seen umbrella ribs 10 held in a closed position by umbrella struts 2 wherein umbrella ribs 10 rotate about pivot point 3, while strut 2 and rib 10 are attached one to the other at the second pivot point 4. Ribs 10 are covered by and attached to water repellent fabric 11. In addition strut 2 is attached to collar 75, which is attached to inner cylinder 79 via the pin 80. Cylinder cap 8 is attached to outermost cylinder 5. Inner cylinder 79 is free to slide up and down within outer cylinder 5. Cylinder 5 is attached at its lower end to the handle 13. A threaded nut 86 has been attached to the lower end of inner cylinder 79 such that when internal screw 81 is threadably inserted and rotated the threaded nut 86 and consequently the inner cylinder 79 move upward and downward. The rotating shaft 89 of bidirectional motor 84 is attached to the lower end of internal screw 81. The casing of the electric motor 84 is attached by means of motor support 83 to the handle 13. By means of electric circuitry commonly known in the art of electronics the potential energy stored in battery 85 can be used to effect, with the movement of position switch 82 to one of its available positions, the shaft of the electric motor 84 to rotate in a given direction causing the upward or downward motion of threaded nut 86. Movement of the position switch 82 to yet another position can be made to effect the rotation in the opposite direction of the shaft of electric motor 84. This of course causes movement of threaded nut 86 and consequently of inner cylinder 79 in a direction opposite to that previously induced. In this manner the umbrella can be made to open and close automatically, where the open position of the umbrella is shown in Figure 2 and the closed position is shown in Figure 1. Figure 3 shows the opened position of the umbrella in overhead view. Ribs 10 are attached to cylinder cap 8 and covered by water repellent fabric 11. Figure 4 shows collar 75 which is attached by means of collar pin 80 to internal rod 79, wherein collar pin 80 extends from collar 75 through slot 74 to internal rod 79. For purposes of illustration, slot 74 has been shown to have a tringularly shaped slot end 77 at its upper end and a triangularly shaped slot end 78 at its lower end.
