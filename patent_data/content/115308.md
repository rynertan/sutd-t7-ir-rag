This invention also relates to a process for preparing the penem antibiotic of structure I, above. This process involves the reaction of an appropriately substituted 2 thiopenam 1 EMI3.1 with a Michael reagent in the presence of base wherein R1 and R2 are as previously defined and R is a removable protecting group. This invention also relates to a process for preparing f and 6,6 disubstituted 2 substituted thio pen 2 emEMI3.2 wherein R1, R , R3, R4, and W are as previously defined, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters which are useful as antibiotics. There is a continuing need for new antibiotics. For, unfortunately, there is no staticeffectiveness of any given antibiotic because continued wide scale usage selectively gives rise to resistant strains of pathogens. In addition, the known antibiotics suffer from the disadvantage of being effective only against certain types of microorganisms. Accordingly, the search for new antibiotics continues. Thus, it it an object of the present invention to provide a novel class of antibiotics which are useful in animal and human therapy and in inanimate systems. These antibiotics are active against a broad range of pathogens which representively include both Gram positive bacteria such as S. aureus, Strep. pyogenes, and B. subtilis, and Gram negative bacteria such as E. coli,Pseudomnas, rroteus morganii, Serratia, and Klebsiella. Further objects of this invention are to provide chemical processes for the preparation of such antibiotics and their nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters pharmaceutical compositions comprising such antibiotics and to provide methods of treatment comprising administering such antibiotics and compositions when an antibiotic effect is indicated. This invention also relates to a process for preparing substituted 2 thioxopenams which are useful in the preparation of known penem antibiotics 7 .The process may be conducted enantiospecifically to produce the latter in their correct enantiomeric state necessary for full antibacterial activity.EMI5.1 EMI6.1 wherein R6 and R7 are independently selected 9 9 from hydrogen R NH R is acyl or H substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, having 1 6 carbon atoms aryl, such as phenyl heterocyclyl, heteroaryl, having 1 4 heteroatoms selected from O,N,S cycloalkyl, and cycloalkenyl wherein said substituent or substituents are selected from halo chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo , hydroxyl1 cyano, carboxyl, amino, and the above recited values for R6 R7. R6 and 7 R are described in detail below however, it should be noted now that the term acyl in the foregoing definition means those acyls known to be effective in the related bicyclic ss lactam antibiotic art, such as the penicillins and cephalosporins.In this regard the definition of acyl recited in U.S. Patent 4,226,866 issued 10 7 80 is incorporated herein by reference. Also, with respect to 6 and 7 R , it should be noted that reactive functional groups carried by R6 R7, such as, amino, hydroxyl, or carboxyl, for example, may be covered by conventional blocking groups, such as p nitrobenzyl oxycarbonyl, 2,2, 2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl and triorganosilyl, wherein the organo moiety is selected from alkyl having 1 6 carbon atoms, phenyl, and phenylalkyl. R2, in functional terms, is a group which potentially forms a stable carbonium ion, for example trityl C C6H5 3 bis methoxyphenyl meth 2 diphenyl isopropyl, 2, 4 dimethoxybenzyl, EMI8.1 and the like. M is a thiophilic metal such as silver, thallium, mercury, or the like. R1 is a removable protecting group such as allyl, p nitrobenzyl,or a biologically removable group, for example pivaloyloxymethyl, pivoloyloxyethyl, ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, phthaliayl, or the like in short, 9 is selected from any of the conventionally employed protecting groups, or pharmaceutically acceptable ester moieties known in the classical penicillins, and cephalosporins and nonclassical e.g., carbapenems, and penems ss lactam antibiotic art see for example, U.S Patent 4,226,866, which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent that it discloses such ester moieties . X is a leaving group such as substituted or unsubstituteci phenoxy, alkoxy, phenylthio, or alkylthio having 2 to 7 carbon atoms halo chloro or bromo , and the like, wherein, for example, such.substituents are chloro, nitro, methyl, and the like. R8, representatively defined below, is, inter alia, substituted and unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, and the like wherein the substituent or substituents are selected from amino, cyano, amidino, carbamoyl, hydroxyl, acyl, acyloxy, carboxy, and the like. The ultimate penem antibiotics 7, including the foregoing definitions for R1, R6, R7 and R 8 are representatively disclosed in the following publications and pending U.S. Patent applications, all of which are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of defining 7 and its utility as an antibiotic U.S. Patent 4,260,618 4 7 81 U.S.Patent 4,215,124 7 29 80 U.K. Patent ApplicationG.B. 2013674A 8 15 79 U.K. Patent Application G.B.2042520A 9 24 80 and U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial Numbers 353,451, filed March 1, 1982 353,450, filed March 1, 1982 353,454, filed March 1, 1982 353,453, filed March 1, 1982 and 373,088, filed April 29, 1982. The conversion process of appropriately substituted 2 thioxopenams 5 to the corresponding antibiotic 2 SR8 pen 2 em 3 carboxylic acids acid 6 is known as is the final deblocking step 6 to 7 EMI9.1 wherein R8Xo is an alkylating agent XO is bromo or iodo, for example and R8 is as defined above1 for example, cyanomethyl, cyanoethyl, or the like R8 is additionally defined below.With respect to the formation of 5 and its conversion to 6, see U.K. Patent Application GB2074563A or J.Chem. Soc. Chem. Cummun. No. 13, pp 713 714 1982 , which are fully incorporated herein by reference. In the previous process referred to above wherein R6 is hydrogen and 7 protected hydroxyethyl the thioxopenams are prepared by a distinctly different process where the C C6 positions have the cis configuration. This is a result of two factors. First, the 3 substituted 4alkylthioazetidinone intermediates are obtained with the C3 C4 trans configuration and, second, the ring closure step involves displacement at the C4 carbon atom causing an inversion at this position.Thus the known alkylation of the cis thioxopenams produces the undescribed and antibacterially inferior 5,6 cis 2 alkylthiopenems which are converted to a mixture containing the 5,6 trans penems by a thermal equilibratio, The present invention maintains the stereochemical integrity of the substituent on the intermediate azetidinone throughout the conversion to thioxopenams and alkylthiopenems. Thus it provides the preferred 5R,6S 6 1 R hydroxyethyl penems from the azetidinone nucleus derived from 6 aminopenicillanic acid. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following diagram conveniently summarizes the process of the present invention DIAGRAM IEMI11.1 In words relative to the above diagram, the azetidinone starting material 1 is known, or can readily be prepared by known methods. Representative, and representatively preferred values for R6 and 7R are given below. R2 in starting material 1 must be a group which allows the formation of a carbonium ion. Preferred values for R2 include, trityl, bis p methoxyphenyl methyl, 2, 4 dimethoxy benzyl, and the like. The most preferred value forR2 is trityl. As defined above, the most preferred values for R1 include allyl, p nitrobenzyl, and the like.The conversion 1 to 2 is accomplished by treating 1 in a solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, DMF, or the like, in the presence of powdered fused potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride, potassium t butoxide, Triton B or the like, and 18 crown 6 or a tetraalkylammonium salt, or the like with a bromoacetic ester such as allyibromoacetate, p nitrobenzylbromo acetate, or the like, for from 0.5 to 4 hours at a temperature of from 0 to 800C. The conversion 2 to 3 is accomplished by treating 2 in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, or solvent mixtures such as methanolmethylene chloride, or the like, in the presence of pyridine, picoline, lutidine, 4 dimethylaminopyridone or the like, with a thiophilic metal salt reagent such as silver, mercury, thallium, nitrate, triflate, acetate, or the like, for from 0.1 to 3 hours at a temperature of from 0 to 600C. The most preferred thiophilic metal is silver, and the most preferred silver reagent is silver nitrate. The conversion 3 to 4 is accomplished by treating 3 in a solvert such as methylene chloride, benzene, tetrahydrofuran, or the like, with a halothiocarbonate ester of the formula EMI13.1 wherein X. tchloro, bromo, and X is an aryloxy, arylthio, alkylthio, alkoxy or halo group, for example, in the presence of pyridine, picoline, lutidine, 4 dimethylaminopyridine, or the like,. at a temperature of 0 to 300C for from 0.5 to 2 hours. In the foregoing, alkyl is 1 6 carbon atoms and aryl is phenyl. In general, the cyclization 4 to S is accomplished in the presence of base. For example, cyclization 4 to 5 may be accomplished by treating 4 in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, ether, dioxane, or the like, or mixtures thereof in the presence of lithium hexamethyldisilazide, lithium 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl piperidide, lithium triethyl methoxide, sodium hydride, potassium t butoxide, or the like, in the presence of hexamethylphosphoramide, lr3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone DMF . or the like, at a temperature of from 780 to 230C for from 0.1 to 8 hours.Alternatively, the conversion of 4 to 5 is accomplished by treating 4 in a solvent such as, methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, benzene, or the like, in the presence of 1,8 diaza bicyclot5.40 undec 7 ene, diisopropylethylamine, l,5 diazabicyclo 4.3.0 non 5 ene l,8 bis dimethyl amino naphthalene, or the like, at a temperature of from 200 to 800C for from 1 to 18 hours. The conversion 5 to 6 is accomplished by treating the 2 thioxopenam in a solvent such as methylenechloride, dimethoxyethane, dimethylformamide, or the like, at a temperature of from 250 to 1000C with an alkylating agent R8XO wherein R8 is alkyl, alkenyl, aralkyl, heteroaralkyl, alkynyl, or heterocyclyl and XO is a leaving group such as halo, arylsulfonate, trifluoromethyl sulfonate, or the like, or with an alkanol, dietbylazodicarboxylate, and triphenyl phosphene, and the like. The final deblocking step 6 to 7 is accomplished by conventional procedures such as hydolysis or hydrogenation. Typically 6 when R1 is p nitrobenzyl in a solvent such as dioxane waterethanol, tetrahydrofuran aqueous dipotassium hydrogen phosphate isopropanol, or the like, is treated under a hydrogen pressure of from 1 to 4 atmosphere in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium on charcoal, palladium hydroxide, or the like at a temperature of from 0 to 500C for from 0.5 to 4 hours to provide 7. When R1 is allyl, the ester is removed by the method of Jeffrey and McCombie, J. Org. Chem. 43, 587 1982 . Typically the penem allyl ester is stirred in a solvent such as methylene chloride, ethylacetate or tetrahydrofuran with potassium or sodium 2 ethylhexanoate and a catalytic amount of tetrabistriphenylphosphine palladium 0 at ambient temperature for from 15 minutes to 1 hour. The potassium salt of the penem usually precipitates from solution or may be precipitated by the addition ofEt2O and is recovered by filtration. When R7 is a protected hydroxyalkyl group the hydroxy protec ing group may be removed prior to or simultaneously with the removal of the ester blocking group.Typically when the protecting group is tert butyldimethylsilyl it is removed prior to deesterification by treatment with 3 eq. of tetrabutylammonium fluoride buffered with 10 eq. of glacial acetic acid in tetrahydrofuran solution at 230 for 24 72 hours. When the hydroxy protecting group is p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and. the ester group is p nitrobenzyl they are removed simultaneously by hydrogenation above .PREPARATION OF STARTING MATERIALEMI15.1 Starting materials 1 are known, or are prepared according to known methods. The.most preferred situation finds R6 H and R7 as defined above, such as, alkyl having 1 6 carbon atoms and hydroxyl substituted alkyl, for example, CH3CH OH wherein the hydroxyl function is typically protected by a triorganosilyl group, such as, t butyldimethylsilyl TBDMS , or the like. The racemic tritylthioazetidinone 1 may be prepared according to U.K.Patent No. 2,042,514 1980 r which is incorporated herein by reference the preferred chiral azetidinone 1 R6 H, R7 protected hydroxyethyl can be prepared from 6 APA by the method of A. Yoshida, T. Hayoshi, N. Takeda, S. Ohda and E. Olki Chem. Pharm.Bull. 29, 2899 1981 , citing the procedure of F. DiNinno, U.S. Patent 4,168,314 1979 and J. Org. Chem.42, 2960 1977 who used a p nitrobenzyl PNB blocking group on the OH instead of TBDMS. These publications are all incorporated herein by reference.Other, representative values of R6 and R7 are listed below.DEFINITION OF R6 and R7EMI16.1 DEFINITION OF R8 Representative values for R8 include CH31 CH2CH3, CH2CONH2, CH2CN, Cfl2CN2OH, CN2CH2CN, CN Me CH2CONH2, CH Me CH2CN, CH2 CH3 CHCN, EMI17.1 EMI17.2 CH2CO2R, where R Me, Et, allyl or pnarmaceutlcally acceptable ester. The most preferred 2 thioxopenams bear at ring position number 6 the 1. hydroxyethyl substituent. The most preferred configuration of these thioxopenams is 8R, 6S, SR.EMI17.3 With regard to the preparation of the preferred 2 thioxopenams of the present invention, the following diagram specifically recites their synthesis. DIAGRAM IIEMI18.1 R t butyldimethylsilyl phenyl R1 CH2CH CH2 or p nitrobenzyl PNB Step I In the preferred process 3R,4R 4 acetoxy 3 R l tert butyldimethylsilyloxy ethyll 2 azetidinone 1 is stirred with sodium triphenylmethylmercaptide in DMF solvent at OOC for 45 minutes to produce after workup and isolation 3S,4R 4 triphenylmethylthio 3 R tert butyldimethylsilyloxy ethyl 2 azetidinone 2 . Alternatively intermediate 2 can be produced by exposure of 1 to tritylmercaptan in methanolic soidum methoxide. Step II The tritylthioazetidinone 2 is treated with 1.5 equivalents of allyl bromoacetate and powdered potassium hydroxide in benzene solvent at ambient temperature in the presence of dicyclohexyl 18 crown 6 for 4 hours. The resulting 3S,4R l allyloxy carbonyl methyl 3 R l tert butyldimethylsilOxy ethyl 4 triphenylmethylthio 2 acetidinone 3 is isolated by conventional means. Alternatively p nitro benzylbromoacetate may be substituted for allylbromoacetate. Step III The azetidinone 3 is treated with a methanolic solution of silver nitrate in the presence of pyridine in methanol solvent at OOC for 0.5 hours. After removal of the water soluble salts the crude mixture containing the silver thiolate 4 is preferably carried into the next step but may be purified by conventional techniques, such as preparative thin layer chromatography. The solvent methanol employed herein serves a dual purpose in that it reacts with the incipient trityl carbonium ion to form trityl methyl ether, which need not be separated from the silver thiolate, as it is inert to the reagents used in Step IV and may be conveniently separated later. The process of forming silver thiolates from 4 tritylthioazetidinone and their acylation has heen described in the U.K. Patent 2,042,520A, which is incorporated above.This invention adopts that process to specifically form a 4 dithiocarbonate ester of an azetidinon l yl acetic ester giving the critical intermediate 4 for the hitherto unknown cyclization reaction in Step V.Step IV The crude silver thiolate obtained from StepIII is thioacylated with phenoxythiocarbonyl chloride in methylene chloride solvent in the presence of pyridine at OOC for 20 minutes. The chlorothiocarbonate ester employed herein is not critical, however, the leaving group X should not be so reactive that is undergoes elimination under the conditions of the thioacylation reaction, leading to side reactions nor so wealkyl reactive that it is displaced with difficulty during Step V. Phenoxy acid substituted phenoxy are preferred for group X, although alkoxy, alkylthio and arylthio may be used.From 0.1 to 1.0 equivalents of pyridine or a similar organic base is used to catalyze the reaction In the preferred case it is not necessary to purify the resulting phenoxythiocarbonyl derivative 5 for use in the next step, particularly if purified silver thiolate is used in the reaction. Step V Purified 3S,4R l allyloxyearbonyl methyl 3 R 1 tert butyldimethylsilyloxy ethyl 4 phenoxy thiocarbonyl thio 2 azetidinone 5 is treated with 2.75 equivalents of the preferred base lithium hexamethyldisilazide at 780C in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran containing some 1, 3 dimethyl 2 imida olidinone DMI , which appears to make the reaction proceed more uniformly, under an atmosphere of nitrogen.After 5 15 minutes, the mixture is neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid, although other organic acids such as acetic, trifluoroacetic, and p toluenesulfonic acids, as well as aqueous buffers, may be used, and worked up to give the desired 2 thioxopenams 7. Since the initial product of the reaction is the thiolate anion 6, it may be treated in situ if desired with the alkylating agent to directly give penem derivatives. Alternatively, a strong organic base such as diazabicycloundecene DBU will give slow cyclization of 5 to 7 at room temperature Although in the preferred process the hydroxy group is protected by a t butyldimethylsilyl group, the presence of this group is not necessary during all of the steps in the reaction sequence. It may be conveniently removed from the thioxo penam 7 either before or after alkylation or it may be removed earlier in the sequence e.g., from 3 and be replaced with a more readily hydrolyzable group such as trimethylsilyl just before the cyclization to 6 . The following diagram conveniently summarizes a process for preparing compounds of Formula I EMI22.1 EMI23.1 In words relative to the foregoing equations, the 2 thioxopenams 1 are readily prepared in either racemic or enantiomerically pure state according to the above cited, and incorporated by reference, concurrently filed application of DiNinno, Leanza, and Ratcliffe see also U.K. Patent Application GB 2074563A or J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. No 13, pp.713 714 1982 , which are incorporated herein by reference Base mediated reactions of thioxopenams 1 with electron deficient olefines, allenes, and acetylenes result in the formation of new penems A and known penems B, above. Such reactions of a nucleophile and an electron deficient acceptor are commonly referred to as Michael type reactions. See MerckIndex, 9th ed., page ONR 60. By the Michael type reactions of thioxopenams 1, as depicted above, is meant those that fall into two general reaction classes a addition to the electron deficient substrate commonly known as Michael acceptors and b addition eliminations, in which theMichael acceptor is suitably disposed to accomodate the expulsion of the leaving group X. X is typically bromo, iodo, sulfonyloxy, phosphoryloxy, or the like.Bases such as diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, diazabicycloundecene DBU , diazabicyclooctane DABCO , sodium hydride, lithium hexamethyldisilazide, or the like, may be employed in the reaction with 1 in a solvent such as acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, methanol, toluene, or the like, at a temperature of from 780C to 80 C for from a few minutes to 72 hours. The electron deficient olefines, allenes, and acetylenes are known, commonly employed synthetic reagents and are explicitly defined below for the purpose of representative disclosure but this listing does not limit the scope of the invention.In addition, the nature of the Michael acceptor maybe cyclical in two general arrays, in which the electron withdrawing component can either be endocyclic or exocyclic. The reactions of thioxopenam 1 as given in equations 4, 6, and 7 provide diastereomeric mixtures of products whereas the analogous reactions of equations 1, 2 and 5 usually provide geometric mixtures of olefines. In equation 2, when W CN, only the Z olef in geometry predominates, the result of the formal trans addition of the thioxopenam to the acetylene. R t R t R r R4, and W are as previously defined. R is an ester protecting group selected from allyl, p nitrobenzyl, o nitrobenzyl, acetonyl, or the like.

Oxidation of the penem esters A and B is conveniently performed using established procedures see for example the following U.S. Patent Applications assigned to Merck Co., which are incorporated herein by reference to the extent that they define the oxidated transformation 1. U.S. Serial Number 353,452, filed March 1, 1982 2. U.S. Serial Number 353,451, filed March 1, 1982 3. U.S. Serial Number 353,450, filed March 1, 1982 4. U.S. Serial Number 353,454, filed March 1, 1982 and 5. U.S.Serial Number 353,453, filed March 1, 1982 in which A or B is treated with 1.0 1.5 equivalents of an oxidant such as m chloroperoxybenzoic acid, peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, or the like, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or the like at a temperature of from 78 C to 230C for from a few minutes to several hours. The deprotection of penems A and B to their biologically active forms I and Ia, respectively, is accomplished by established procedures. When R1 or R2 is a protected hydroxyalkyl group the hydroxy protecting group may be removed prior to or simultaneously with the removal of the ester blocking group. Typically when the protecting group is tert butyldimethylsilyl it is removed prior to deesterification by treatment with 3 eq. of tetrabutylammonium fluoride buffered with 10 eq. of glacial acetic acid in tetrahydrofuran solution at 230 for 24 72 hours. When the hydroxy protecting group is p nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl and the ester group is p nitrobenzyl they are removed simultaneously by hydrogenation below . The final deblocking step to I andIa is accomplished by conventional procedures such as hydolysis or hydrogenation. Typically A and B when R is p nitrobenzyl in a solvent such as dioxane waterethanol, tetrahydrofuran aqueous dipotassium hydrogen phosphate isopropanol, or the like, is treated under a hydrogen pressure of from 1 to 4 atmosphere in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium on charcoal, palladium hydroxide, or the like at a temperature of from 0 to 500C for from 0.5 to 4 hours to provide I or Ia. When R is allyl, the ester is removed by the method of Jeffrey and McCombie, J. Org. Chem. 43, 587 1982 . Typically the penem allyl ester is stirred in a solvent such as methylene chloride, ethylacetate or tetrahydrofuran with potassium or sodium 2 ethylhexanoate and a catalytic amount of tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium 0 at ambient temperature for from 15 minutes to 1 hour.

These publications are all incorporated herein by reference.Other, representative values of R1 and R2 are listed below. 1 2DEFINITION OF R and R EMI32.1 The most preferred 2 thioxopenams bear at ring position number 6 the l hydroxyethyl substituent. The most preferred configuration of these thioxopenams is 8R, 6S, 5R.EMI32.2 With regard to the preparation of the preferred 2 thioxopenams of the present invention, the following diagram specifically recites their synthesis. DIAGRAM IVEMI33.1 R t butyldimethylsilyl phenyl R1 CH2CH CH2 or p nitrobenzyl PNB Step I In the preferred process 3R,4R 4 acetoxy 3 I R l tert butyldimethylsilyloxy ethyl 2 azetidinone 1 is stirred with sodium triphenylmethylmercaptide in DMF solvent at 0 C for 45 minutes to produce after workup and isolation 3S,4R 4 triphenylmethylthio 3 R 1 tert butyldimetylsilyloxy ethyl 2 azetidinone 2 . Alternatively intermediate 2 can be produced by exposure of 1 to tritylmercaptan in methanolic sodium methoxide.Step II The tritylthioazetidinone 2 is treated with 1.5 equivalents of allyl bromoacetate and powdered potassium hydroxide in benzene solvent at ambient temperature in the presence of dicyclohexyl 18 crown 6 for 4 hours The resulting 3S,4R l allyloxy carbonylEmethyl 3 R l tert butyldimethylsiloxy ethyl 4 triphenylmethylthio 2 azetidinone 3 is isolated by conventional means. Alternatively p nitro benzylbromoacetate may be substituted for allylbromoacetate. Step III The azetidinone 3 is treated with a methanolic solution of silver nitrate in the presence of pyridine in methanol solvent at OCC for 0.5 hours. After removal of the water soluble salts the crude mixture containing the silver thiolate 4 is preferably carried into the next step but may be purified by conventional techniques, such as preparative thin layer chromatography. The solvent methanol employed herein serves a dual purpose in that it reacts with the incipient trityl carbonium ion to form trityl methyl ether, which need not be separated from the silver thiolate, as it is inert to the reagents used in Step IV and may be conveniently separated later. The process of forming silver thiolates from 4 tritylthioazetidinone and their acylation has been described in the U.K. Patent 2,042,520A, which is incorporated above.This invention adopts that process to specifically form a 4 dithiocarbonate ester of an azetidinon l yl acetic ester giving the critical intermediate 4 for the hitherto unknown cyclization reaction in Step V. Step IV The crude silver thiolate obtained from Step ill is thioacylated with phenoxythiocarbonyl chloride in methylene chloride solvent in the presence of pyridine at OOC for 20 minutes. The chlorothio carbonate ester employed herein is not critical, however, the leaving group X should not be so reactive that is undergoes elimination under the conditions of the thioacylation reaction, leading to side reactions nor so weakly reactive that it is displaced with difficulty during Step V. Phenoxy and substituted phenoxy are preferred for group X, although alkoxy, alkylthio and arylthio may be used. From 0.1 to 1.0 equivalents of pyridine or a similar organic base is used to catalyze the reaction. In the preferred case it is not necessary to purify the resulting phenoxythiocarbonyl derivative 5 for use in the next step, particularly if purified silver thiolate is used in the reaction. Step V Purified 3S,4R l allyloxycarbonyl methyl 3 R l tert butyldimethylsilyloxy ethyl 4 phenoxy thiocarbonyl thio 2 azetidinone 5 is treated with 2.75 equivalents of the preferred base lithium hexamethyldisilazide at 780C in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran containing some l,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone DM1 , which appears to make the reaction proceed more uniformly, under an atmosphere of nitrogen.After 5 15 minutes, the mixture is neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid, although other organic acids such as acetic, trifluoroacetic, and p toluenesulfonic acids, as well as aqueous buffers, may be used, and worked up to give the desired 2 thioxopenams 7. Alternatively, a strong organic base such as diazabicycloundecene DBU will give slow cyclization of 5 to 7 at room temperature. Although in the preferred process the hydroxy group is protected by a t butyldimethylsilyl group, the presence of this group is not necessary during all of the steps in the reaction sequence. It may be conveniently removed from the thioxo penam 7 or it may be removed earlier in the sequence e.g., from 3 and be replaced with a more readily hydrolyzable group such as trimethylsilyl just before the cyclization to 6 .

EXAMPLE 21Preparation of Pharmaceutical Compositions One such unit dosage form is prepared by mixing 120 mg of compound A Compound of Example 18 with 20 mg of lactose and 5 mg of magnesium stearate and placing the 145 mg mixture into a No. 3 gelatin capsule. Similarly, by employing more of the active ingredient and less lactose, other dosage forms can be put up in No. 3 gelatin capsules, and, should it be necessary to mix more than 145 mg of ingredients together, larger capsules such as compressed tablets and pills can be prepared. The following examples are illustrative of the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations TABLET PER TABLETCompound A 125 mg.Cornstarch, U.S.P. 6 mg.Dicalcium Phosphate 192 mg.Lactose, U.S.P. 190 mg.Magnesium Stearate Balance 800 mg. The active ingredient is blended with dicalcium phosphate, lactose and about half of the cornstarch. The mixture is then granulated with 15 cornstarch paste 6 mg and rough screened. It is dried at 450C and screened again through No. 16 screens. The balance of the cornstarch and magnesium stearate is added and the mixture is compressed into tablets, approximately 0.5 inch in diameter each weighing 800 mg.
