# Reactor monitoring assembly.

## Abstract
A combined in core flux detector and thermocouple assembly for a nuclear reactor composed of an outer tube 20 which is sealed at its upper end an inner tube 24 disposed within, and extending along the length of, the outer tube 20 a neutron detector means 28 disposed within the inner tube 24 an element 30 connected to the neutron detector for displacing the neutron detector along the length of the inner tube 24 and a plurality of thermocouples 34 37 disposed outside of the inner tube 24 and enclosed within the outer tube 20 . With this arrangement a plurality of measurement loca tions can be served with one reactor vessel penetration.
