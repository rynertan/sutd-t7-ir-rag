## Abstract
A computer comprises an integrated circuit device having addressable memory locations and a processor with a plurality of registers 60, 63, 65 67, 69 74 arranged for sequential execution of a plurality of instructions each instruction being of the same bit size and having the same format of bit positions, one set of bit positions being function bits and other bit posi tions being data bits. Such instructions enable the processor to operate with a reduced number of registers 60, 63, 65 67, 69 74 and reduced time delays in decoding instructions.
