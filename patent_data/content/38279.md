# Tire and method of reinforcement.

## Abstract
A cast or injection molded tire 57 having a reinforcing sheet 11 14 of netting material providing openings 62 for striking through of elastomeric material during filling of the mold 45. The process of making the tire 57 includes shaping the sheet 11 14 of netting material by stretching and thereby orienting the stands 15, 16. The shaping is done at elevated temperatures and then the netting material cooled in the shaped form. A mat 10,28 of overlapping sheets 11 14 of netting material may be used with the strands 15, 16 being muitidirectional to provide uniform sidewall strength. An overlapping breaker ply 42, 43 of netting material may also be used to connect two mats 10,28 of reinforcing sheets 11 14 on opposite sides of the tire 57.
