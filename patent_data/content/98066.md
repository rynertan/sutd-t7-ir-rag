# A data transmission system.

## Abstract
A data transmission system including two transmission wirings or lines comprising magnetic coupling means con nected to at least one of said two wirings, and element means connected between a pair of transmission wirings, the element means showing a low impedance at a data transmitting frequency for transferring data in the data transmission system, so that the magnetic coupling means and the element means provide the data to be transferred in the data transmission system.
