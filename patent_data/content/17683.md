Means for testing the load bearing characteristics of a shipping container comprising means for supporting a load so that the load can he inserted into the container through open doors at one end thereof, means for elevating the container so that the load is transferred from the supporting means to the container, means for supporting the container in the elevated position when the elevating means are lowered and means for measuring any stresses or strains in the container whilst it is under load. 2. Means as claimed in claim 1 wherein the container is supported on a platform mounted on a carriage running on a track aligned with the load supporting means, and the elevating means are positioned between the platform and the carriage. 3. Means as claimed in claim 2 wherein the elevating means comprises air bags, or hydraulic jacks or screw jacks or scissors. 4. Means as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims wherein the load is in the form of a plurality of removable segments. 5. Means as claimed in anyone ofthe preceding claims wherein the load is supported on the load supporting means in a saddle like fashion. 6. Means as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims wherein the load is fitted with wheels or rollers to enable a test under a rolling load to be conducted. 7. Means as claimed in anyone of the preceding claims wherein the means for supporting the container comprises one or more sets of twist locks for supporting the container from the top or from each side, said sets of twist locks being fitted to a supporting structure. 8. Means for testing the load bearing characteristIcs of a shipping container substantially as herein described.

## Description
THIS INVENTION relates to the testing of shipping containers to ensure that they are capable of carrying a predetermined load.At the present, cargo handling equipment such as slings, grabs, and the like are subjected to regular testing to ensure that they have not deteriorated and are capable of supporting a predetermined load. Shipping containers are not subjected to such testing because a simple means of testing is not available.The object of the present invention is to provide such a means of testing which is relatively safe in use.The invention resides in a means for testing the load being characteristics of a shipping container comprising means for supporting a load so that the load can be inserted into the container through open doors at one end thereof, means for elevating the container so that the load is transferred from the supporting means to the container, means for supporting the container in the elevated position when the elevating means are lowered and means for measuring any stresses or strains in the container whilst it is under load.The invention will be better understood by reference to the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying diagrammatic drawings wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing the container in broken lines in the position prior to elevation Fig. 2 is an end elevation and Fig. 3 is a side elevation showing the container being positioned to receive the load supporting means. As shown in the drawings the supporting means comprises an elongated beam 11 anchored at one end to a supporting structure 12 so that it projects therefrom in a substantially horizontal cantilevered position. A substantially inverted U shaped test load 13 of a size appropriate to the size of the container to be tested is mounted on the beam in a saddle like position as is best seen in Fig. 2As will be seen in Fig. 3 of the drawings the load is in two segments. It may be formed in any number of segments so that the load can be readily varied by removing one or more segments. The beam is positioned above a track 14 on which a carriage 15 is mounted. The track is aligned with the supporting beam which is surmounted by a supporting structure 16 provided with conventional twist locks 17, 18 and 19 for engaging a container in the usual manner.The container to be tested identified by reference C and shown in broken lines is mounted on a platform 20 carried by the carriage 15. Air bags 21 or other suitable elevating means such as hydraulic or screw jacks or scissors are positioned between the carriage and the platform to enable the platform to be raised.In operation the container C to be tested is positioned on the platform 20 with the carriage 15 clear of the supporting structure. The platform is provided with suitable guides not shown for correctly positioning the containers and the doors at the end of the container adjacent the supporting structure. The carriage is then moved into position under the supporting structure with the load on the supporting beam entering the container through the open doors. Means not shown are provided for correctly positioning the carriage with respect to the supporting structure. The platform is then elevated to lift the container to a position in which it can be engaged by one of the sets of twist locks. This action provides one test for the alignment of the container. If the container is out of square the twist locks will not properly engage the container. As the container is lifted it engages the load 13 and lifts it clear of the supporting beam 11. After the twist locks have engaged the container the platform is lowered leaving the container suspended from one of the sets of twist locks. Strain gauges or photogrammetric means or other suitable measuring devices of conventional design are used to test the strength of the container. If desired the container may be tested whilst supported from the top set of twist locks 17 or one of the two side sets 18 and 19.If it is desired to test the container under a rolling load wheels may be provided on the underside of the load 13.When the tests have been completed the platform is raised and the twist locks disengaged. As the container is lowered the load engages the supporting beam 11 after which the carriage can be run clear of the supporting structure and then the container lifted off. In the embodiment described above the supporting beam 11 remains in position so that it will receive and support the load 13 if a container should fail when under test.In some instances it may be desired to test a container with the doors closed. In this case the supporting structure is located at the other end of the track remote from the load supporting beam. The container is run into position with the doors open at one end and the platform elevated so that the load is engaged by the container and lifted clear of the supporting beam. The carriage is then moved clear of the supporting beam with the load in the container and the doors closed. The carriage is then moved into position under the supporting structure and tested. The operation is then reversed to return the load to its position on the supporting beams.
