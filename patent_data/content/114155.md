# A dismountable belt conveyor.

## Abstract
In order to make a belt conveyor easily dismountable and easy to operate, the conveyor includes a framing com posed of at least three parts 12, 17 provided with telescop ing components 26 . The end parts 12 of the framing are provided with support means 13 designed in such a manner that the belt 20 can be slipped into the framing 10 side wardly, when the parts have been assembled, but before the framing has been stretched to its full length, for instance by means of turnbuckles 27, 28 or the like.

## Description
Translation convention draftA DISMOUNTABLE BELT CONVEYOR. The present invention refers to a dismountable bet conveyor, in the first hand adapted to transfer roof tiles from the ground to a roof, or vice versa, but which can also be used in various construction works. The aim is to provide a conveyor composed of parts having a size and weight permitting it to be easily moved from one place to another, for instance by a small truck or a car trailer. A prerequisite for a simple and safe operation is the possibility of using a belt, permanently formed into an endless unit. This will impose certain restrictions upon the framing carrying the belt, the intention being to permit the belt being slipped into, and removed from the framing, respectively, but nevertheless being satisfactorily stretched in use. The invention thus refers to a dismountable belt conveyor comprising a framing carrying driving means and having rollers at its opposite ends for guiding an endless belt.The invention is characterized in that the framing is com posed of at least three interengaging parts, of which the end parts each carries a roller and is provided with support means adapted to permit a sideward introduction of the belt into the framing before this is extended to full operating length. The parts of the framing are preferably adapted for interengagement by way of telecoping components, and an elongating device, for instance a turnbuckle, is fitted between at least two of the parts of the framing. The invention wilL below be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in whichFigure 1 schematically shows a belt conveyor according to the invention,Figure 2 shows the upper end part oE the conveyor, Figure 3 shows the lower end part of the conveyor, andFigure 4 shows a belt support adapted to be mounted at the intermediate part of the conveyor. The conveyor 10 shown in Figure 1 comprises a lower end part 11 and an upper end part 12. These are provided with strut members 13 and 14, respectively, or other suitable support means, which facilitate the location of the conveyor with one end resting upon the ground 15 while the other end extends to a roof 16, or some other elevated structure. An intermediate part 17 extends between the two end parts 11 and 12, and may possibly be subdivided into two or more portions, so a suitable length of the conveyor is obtained considering the expected work to be performed, but without each part being too long or too heavy for transportation in dismounted state. Each end part 11, 12 carries a roller 18, 19, of which the former encloses a built in, reversible electric motor. An endless belt 20 will, in use, pass over the rollers 18, 19 and is provided with spaced apart carrier dogs 21. As the driving motor is reversible the conveyor can be used for instance for transferring roof tiles from the ground to a roof, but it may also be used for lowering tiles to the ground, when a roof is to be repaired. The lower end part 11 of the framing and a portion of the intermediate part 17 are shown in Figure 3. An electric motor not shown is fitted within the roller 18, and is supplied with current through a cable 22. Starting and stopping, as well as selection of direction of rotation are governed by means of a control box 23. The intermediate part 17 can be formed as a ladder like structure having parallel side beams 24, interconnected by cross pieces 25. The end parts 11 and 12, as well as the intermediate part 17 are built up of square section Light nepal tubes, the tube ends of one part being provided with studs 26 oE reduced cross suction, which can be introduced in the tubular ends of the juxtaposed part. The studs 26 permit a guided telescoping movement between the parts, which is essential for the possibility of mounting and stretching the belt 20. For that purpose it is important that the strut means 13 and 14 are designed so as to permit the belt 20 being slipped on sidewardly upon the framing. This will preliminarily be assembled with the parts 11, 12, 17 pushed to a close position. When the belt has been slipped upon the rollers 18, 19, the belt is stretched by the parts 11, 12, 17 being moved apart, along the studs 26. This can be performed by means of a turnbuckle device 27, 28, or by means of toggle levers or the like. Adjacent to the end rollers 18, 19 there are guiding rollers 29, rotating about axes being perpendicular to the plane of the framing. A suitable number of support rollers 30, rotating about axes parallel to the plane of the framing are provided at the uppwardly face of the framing. The latter rollers are, in a conventional manner, provided with tapering end portions. These rollers will support the belt and hold it out of contact from the framing the tapering end portions guiding the belt in its longitudinal direction. At the lower face of the framing there are further guide rollers 31, similar to the guide rollers 29 at the end parts. At the lower face of the framing the belt tends to sag down, so support rollers 30 will not be so efficient here. Support rollers 30 and guide rollers 31 can preferably be mounted at a fitting 32 of the kind shown in Figure 4. A number of such fittings are mounted at the intermediate framing part 17, spaced apart by a suitable distance. The embodiment shown and described in the specification will illustrate he basic principle only, and the shape of the various components may vary in many ways within the scope of the appended claims. The intermediate part 17 may, as is mentioned above, be composed of a number of components fitted together. The struts 13 of the lower end part 11 may be provided with wheels to facilitate transportation of the conveyor within a working place.
