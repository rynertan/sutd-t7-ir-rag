# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY DEVICE

## Abstract
In a semiconductor memory device including memory 7 and dummy cells 6 connected to groups of data lines 3 , word lines 4 and dummy word lines 9 for selecting the memory and dummy cells, respectively, and a signal detec tor 8 for differentially amplifying the read signal from the memory cell selected by the signal of the word line and a reference signal from the dummy cell, the improvement wherein the memory cell capacitor 1 consists of two capacitors, each having substantially the same structure as a dummy cell capacitor 11 and connected in parallel with the other.
