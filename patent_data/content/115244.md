# Fuel control.

## Abstract
Fuel flow to the burner 10 of a gas turbine engine 15 is turned on and off by a minimum pressure valve 60 controlled by a fluid pressure operated sequence valve 110 . The sequence valve includes a valve element 125 set by the pressurization thereof with fuel discharged from a pump 35 . The setting of the sequence valve element 125 is maintained by a fluid latch also energized by fuel discharged from the pump whereby no complex linkages or electric motors are required for the setting of the sequence valve and the maintenance of such setting.
