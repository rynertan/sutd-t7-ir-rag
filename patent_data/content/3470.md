## Description
The present invention relates to a saliva ejector comprising a suction tube which can be bent to different forms and is adapted to be connected to a suction hose at one end thereof, an inlet opening being provided at the other end of said tube. The most common saliva ejector of this type millions of which are manjfactured and used every year by dentists practically all over the world has a small cap of polyethylene which includes a caqe portion of varying length and a socket portion. The cap is mounted on the suction tube at said other end, the inlet end, by meats of the socks portion so that the cage portion covers the inlet opening. The caqe portion then serves as a spacer keeping the soft tissue of the mouth spaced from the inlet opening of the suction tube when the saliva ejector is supported at the cap by the floor of the mouth, to prevent the soft tissue from being sucked into the suction tube when the saliva ejector is beina used.If the soft tissues are sucked into the suction tube this can be painful to the patient and moreover can cause unpleasant sores in the mouth. The saliva ejector of this type is well suited for its purposes but from a productional point of view it is not weli suited for mass production because the cap is a separate part which must be manufactured individually by injection moulding and must be mounted on the suction tube in a separate working step. Furthermore, the cap must also in many cases be secured to the suction tube when this is prescribed by the authorities concerned, which means that the manufacture will be still more complicated. In a saliva ejector recently proposed the cap is replaced by a socket open at both ends, which is passed onto the suction tube at one end thereof, a connection being provided between the inner end of this socket and the passage through the suction tube. A socket of this type can easily be produced because it can be cut from an extruded tube length and therefore a saliva ejector of this type is more advantageous than that having a cage cap. However, the working step of mounting and possibly securing the socket on the suction tube is still necessary. The object of the invention is to eliminate at a saliva ejector of the kind initially referred to the risk of the soft tissues of the mouth being sucked into the suction tube when the saliva ejector is being used, by arranging the suction tube proper in a special way so that caps, sockets or other separate events can be dispensed with. For this purpose the saliva ejector is c .aracter ized in that an end portion of the tube at said ther end, such portion being formed with a series of through openings in the tube wall, is aouhie olded with the openings facing each other and with the fold parts engaging each other, the tube being flattened at the fold. The arrangement according to the invention considerably facilitates the manufacture of the saliva ejector and moreover the saliva ejector to a great extent can be manufactured by automatic operations because no separate elements are involved. In order to illustrate the invention an embodiment thereof will be described in more detail below reference being made to the accompanying drawing in which FIG. 1 shows a hose of which the saliva ejector is to be manufactured, in a first stage of manufacture FIG. 2 shows the hose after having been double folded at one end thereof and FIG. 3 shows the completed saliva ejector bent to the form which it usually has when used in the mouth. The suction tube in a conventional manner can comprise a hose 10 of polyethylene or other suitable plastics material a wire 11 being embedded in the wall of the tube so that the hose will maintain the form to which it has been bent. One end 12 of the suction tube is adapted to be connected to a suction hose while the other end 13 shall be located in the mouth.At said latter end there is provided a longitudinal row of openings in the tube wall said openings incudin two longer transverse slots 14 at the outer and inner ends of the row, respectively, and three intermediate shorter transverse slots 15. Such slots can easily be cut in an automatic machine by using cutting tools. The form of the openings is of no importance. Thus, the openings can be rectangular, oval or circular or thav can have a form which more or less resembles one or theZother of these forms. The slots 14 and 15 are cut in the wall of hose 10 as closely as possible and symmetrically in relation to a longitudinal line diametrically opposite to wire 11. In a second step of the manufacture of the saliva ejector the end portion with openings 14 and 15 is double folded in such a way that the openings will be facing each other and wire 11 will be located on the outside of the fold as shown in FIG. 2. When the hose is double folded it will be flattened at the fold proper. The folding will be more compact if it takes place at a location where the central slot 15 is positioned particularly when the walls between the slots are thin so that no substantial compression of the material will take place at the inner side of the fold. The passage through the hose could be completely blocked at the fold by such compression and, moreover, the folding would be clumsy.The fold parts engage each other and preferably the end 13 is folded firmly against the hose 10 where it is kept in position by wire 11 so that said end completely or partly covers the innermost slot 14 in order to reduce false draught through this slot. The hose can be terminated at end 13 in a plane through the outermost slot 14 which accordinxly will ha e only about half the width of the other slots. Tris will make it easier to cover the innermost slot 14 ard simultaneously to provide a more compact fording. In the final form according to FIG. 3 the hose 10 is bent substantially to the form of an umbrella handle the wire 11 being located at the inner slae oz the bend, and the folded portion at the end 13 is bent outwardly at an angle to the rest of the hose. The form of the bend and the angle of the folded portion can be adapted to the work that has to be performed in he moth, and this is made by the dentist when using te saliva ejector in the specific case. The folded portion forms a support plate by which the saliva ejector when suspended from the mouth can rest against the soft tissues of the mouth floor if not supported at the bend by the lower row of teeth. Since the suction openings formed by the slots 14 and 15 are located between the upper and lower parts of the double folded portion of the hose and open at the side of the double folded portion the risk of soft tissue being sucked into said slots when the saliva ejector is being used is reduced to a minimum. However, an excellent drainage of the mouth is obtained by means of the saliva ejector because the openings are located relatively close to the surface resting against the soft tissues in the mouth.Thus, the saliva is not allowed to rise to an appreciably high level on the mouth floor before the saliva is sucked up and disposed of by means of the saliva ejector. If the slots 14 and 15 should be obstructed more or less at the sides of the saliva ejector due to a too great flattening of the folded portion or due to the fact that amalgam or other material emanating from the work in the mouth is collected at the side openings the drainage can be impeded so that the saliva level on the mouth floor rises. Fowever, the saliva will soon flow into the hose through the opening at the end 13 thereof.Then, the saliva may not be able to pass through the passage of the hose past the fold proper where the hose is flattened and the passage through the hose may be blocked as a consequence thereof but nevertheless the saliva will be removed because it can flow out through the slots 14 and 15 of the upper part of the folded portion and then flow into the hose again through the slots 14 and 15 of the lower part of the folded portion wF e t. saliva will be stoked away immediately. When the e d portion of the saliva ejector, formed with opening, s folded the wire 11 uncovered at the end surface of the hose will be drawn into the material of the hose wall due to the fact that the wire is located at the outer side of the fold. Thereby it is avoided that the patient could be injured in the mouth by a projecting wire end. It is possible, of course, to make the folded portion longer or shorter than that shown herein and to arrange more or less openings in the hose wall than shown herein if this is found suitable considering the work that has to be performed in the mouth.
