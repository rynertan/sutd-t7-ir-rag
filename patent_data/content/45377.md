# Heat recovery system.

## Abstract
A system for recovering waste heat from a stream of heated gas is disclosed. The system includes a convection heat transfer chamber 12 , a boiler tank 14 , and a plurality of heat pipes 68 thermally interconnecting the convection heat transfer chamber 12 with the boiler tank 14 . Each of the heat pipes 68 includes an evaporator section 76 which is disposed in heat transfer relation with a stream of heated gas flowing through the convection heat transfer chamber 12 , and a condenser section 78 disposed in heat transfer relation with a volume of water contained within the boiler tank 14 . The boiler tank 14 is provided with a header plate 66 having an array of heat pipe openings 108 through which the heat pipes 68 project. A heat pipe support sleeve 100 is received in each heat pipe opening 108 in sealed engagement with the header plate 66 , with the heat pipes 68 projecting through the support sleeves 100 and thermally interconnecting the convection heat transfer chamber 12 with the boiler tank 14 . An intermediate portion of each heat pipe 68 is received in sealed engage ment with its associated support sleeve 100 .
