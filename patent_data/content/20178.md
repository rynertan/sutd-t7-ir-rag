# Rotational speed detector.

## Abstract
A rotation speed signal detector comprises a cylindrikal rotor magnet 1 having n rotor magnet poles 1A provided along the inner circumference and m m n rotation speed detection magnet poles 1B provided along the outer circumference a stator winding 4A a rotation speed detection coil 5 including a pair of coil conductors 16, 17 provided on the outer side of the rotor magnet in the form of a ring and a terminal base 8 having output terminal pins connected to one end portion of the coil conductors and a short circuiting terminal pin for connecting the other ends of the coil conductors. Each conductor may be short circuited by a conductor on a winding conductor processing substrate 7 provided separately instead of being short circuited by the terminal pin.
