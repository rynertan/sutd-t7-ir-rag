# Improvements in or relating to heat stabilizer compositions and to halogen containing polymers or resins containing the heat stabilizer compositions.

## Abstract
The combination of one or more conventional antimony or bismuth containing heat stabilizers with certain aromatic esters or aryloxides containing boron, phosphorus, silicon, an timony, tin or zinc interacts synergistically to provide an unex pectedly high level of heat stability to halogen containing po lymers or resins such as polyvinyl chloride PVC . In addition the aromatic ester or aryloxide inhibits spontaneous degrada tion of the stabilizing component in the presence of heat and or light.
