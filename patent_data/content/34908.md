## Description
PROCESS FOR ilYDRODEMETALLIZATION OF iIYDROCARBON STREAElS Background of the Invention This invention is related to the catalytic treatment in the presence of hydrogen of heavy hydrocarbon streams containing asphaltenic material and metals and to catalysts that are employed in such treatment. It is widely known that various organometallic compounds and asphaltenes are present in petroleum crude oils and other heavy petroleum hydrocarbon streams, such as petroleum hydrocarbon residua, hydrocarbon streams derived from tar sands, and hydrocarbon streams derived from coal. The most common metals found in such hydrocarbon streams are nickel, vanadium, and iron. Such metals are very harmful to various petroleum refining operations, such as hydrocracking, hydrodesulfurization, and catalytic cracking. The metals and asphaltenes cause interstitial plugging of the catalyst bed and reduced catalyst life. The various metal deposits on a catalyst tend to poison or deactivate the catalyst. moreover, the asphaltenes tend to reduce the susceptibility of the hydrocarbons to desulfurization. If a catalyst, such as a desulfurization catalyst or a fluidized cracking catalyst. is exposed to a hydrocarbon fraction that contains metals and asphaltenes, the catalyst will become deactivated rapidly and will be subject to premature removal from the particular reactor and replacement by new catalyst. Although processes for the hydrotreating of heavy hydrocarbon streams, including but not limited to heavy prudes, reduced crudes, and petroleum hydrocarbon residua, are known, the use of fixed bed catalytic processes to convert such feedstocks without appreciable asphaltene precipitation and reactor plugging and with effective removal of metals and other contaminants, such as sulfur compounds and nitrogen compounds, are not too common.while the heavy portions of hydrocarbon streams once could be used as a low quality fuel or as a source of asphaltic tpe materials, the politics and economics of today require that such material be hydrotreated to remove environmcntal hazards therefrom and to obtain a greater proportion of usable products from such feeds. As the availability of various petroleum hydrocarbon types becomes diminished, the refineries are looking toward heavier and heavier feedstocks for processing.In addition, they are looking for alternate sources of hydrocarbons, among which are coal, oil shale, and tar sands. Of course, as the hydrocarbon stream is composed of higher amounts of higher boiling materials, asphaltenes, metals, and other contaminants, more sophisticated and comples refining techniques must be employed.This more recent technology includes the use of specific types of catalysts, particularly, those catalysts which are made up of very large pore materials. Such materials include the more common refractory inorganic oxides, namely, alumina, silica, and silica alumina, as well as a newer type of catalytic support, namely, a microporous glass catalyst support. Numerous references have disclosed catalysts having glass catalyst supports. In United States Patent 3,843,340, Cone teaches a method for making glass beads, which are useful as catalyst supports. Several patents consider skeletal glass catalysts.In United States Patent 2,834,738, Vincent considers the production of skeletal glass catalysts containing silica.and alumina from a misture of materials containing alumina, silica, boric acid, and an alkaline earth metal. In United States Patent 2,835,637, Dowden, et al., consider the production of alumina silica catalysts, e.g., a skeletal glass of good mechanical strength and catalytic activity. Such catalysts are useful for dealkylation, isomerization, and alcohol dehydration. In United States Patent 2,863,838, Vincent considers the production of catalysts containing vanadium and a skeletal glass material. Such catalysts are useful for the oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide. The patent literature also teaches the use of porous glass support materials for catalysts to be used in the control of automobile exhaust emissions. For example, in United States Patent 3,804,647, Elmer, et al., teach a stabilized porous glass support material for noble metal and base metal catalysts which can be used in the catalytic conversion of harmful automotive exhaust emissions. In United States Patent 3,881,944,Beall, et al., disclose the development of strong, highly porous glass ceramic bodics that are useful as catalyst supports for catalysts that can be employed in the emissions control systems associated with internal combustion engines. In United States Patent 4,045,370, Cares discloses the deep polymerization of. oligomers of isobutylene at a temperature of 2000C to 5800C in the vapor phase by employing a catalyst consisting essentially of the oxides of chromium, molybdenum, or tungsten on a highsurface area silica. Cares prefers a silica support, but indicates that alumina, fire brick, glass beads, and ceramics can be used as the support material. Handel, et al., In United States Patents 3,843,341, 3,923,533, 3,923,688, 3,972,720, and 3,972.721, disclose the use of thermally stable, mechanically strong, micro porous glass articles with large pore volumes, surface areas, and varying pore sizes as catalyst supports for the refining of petroleum hydrocarbons. They also disclose methods for making such glass materials in the form of beads. In Z. ANORG. ALLGEA1, CHO 1., Volume 432, pages 242 8 1977 , wolf, et al., consider the hydrogenation of hydrocarbons on catalysts of a porous glass metal system. In United States Patent 3,513,106, Chapman, et al. disclose a method for making a porous glass catalyst having at its surface a catalytically active species such as a mixed oxide catalyst. Primarily, such catalysts are useful for cracking of hydrocarbons, for isonierization reactions, and for the alkylation and dealkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons. In United States Patent 3,816,298, Aldridge considers a process wherein a hydrocarbon feedstream com prising heavy hydrocarbons is simultancously coked, partially desulfurized, hydrogenated, cracked, and par tially converted to a hydrogen containing gas in the presence of an alkali metal containing catalyst which can have a solid particulate support of porcelain, glass, or marble spheres or other inert spherical materials. It has now been found that a catalyst having a support material comprising porous glass which has unique physical properties can be used satisfactorily for the hydrodemetallization of hydrocarbon residual material and tar sands. Summary of the Invention Broadly, according to the invention, there is provided a process for the hydrodemetallization of a heavy hydrocarbon stream containing asphaltenes and a substantial amount of metals, which process comprises contacting said stream in a reaction zone under suitable conditions and in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst comprising one or more transition metals on a porous glass support having a surface area within the range of about 50 m2 gin to about 300 m2 gm, a pore volume within the range of about 0.2 cc gm to about 0.8 cc gm, and an average pore diameter within the range of about 70 A 7 nm to about 450 45 nm . Metals from Group VIB of the Periodic Table of Elements and Group VIII of thePeriodic Table are suitable for the catalyst of this process. Preferred metals are cobalt, nickel, molyb denim, and tungsten. Any metal is present as the element, an oxide, a sulfide, or mixtures thereof. Suitable operating conditions for this hydroconversion process comprise an average catalyst bed temperature of about 3710C 7000F to about 4820C 9000F , a total pressure of about 3.55 MPa 500 psig to about 41.5 MPa 6,000 psig , a hydrogen partial pressure of about 3.45 MPa 500 psia to about 20.7 MPa 3,000 psia , a hydrogen flow rate or hydrogen addition rate of about 178 m3 m3 1,000 SCFB to about 1,780 m3 m3 10,000 SCFB , gas volumes are measured at 15.60C and 101.3 kPaj and an LHSV of about 0.2 to about 2.5 volumes of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst. Brief Description of the Drawing The accompanying figure is a simplified schematic flow diagram of an embodiment of the process of the present invention. Detailed Description The present invention is directed to a novel process for the hydrodemetallization of heavy hydrocarbon feedstocks. Such feedstocks will contain asphaltenes, metals, and other contaminants, such as nitrogen compounds and sulfur compounds. It is to be understood that the feedstocks that are to be treated by the process of the present invention will contain from a small amount of nickel and vanadium, e.g., less than 15 ppm nickel and less than 30 ppm vanadium, up to more than 500 ppm of nickel and 500 ppm of vanadium and from 6 wt up to about 14 wt asphaltenes. The above mentioned contaminants will deleteriously affect the subsequent processing of such feedstocks, if they are not lowered to acceptable levels. Typical feedstocks that can be treated satisfactorily by the process of the present invention will often contain a substantial amount of components that boil appreciably above 5380C 1,0000F . Examples of typical feedstbcks are crude oils, topped crude oils, petroleum hydrocarbon residua, both atmospheric and vacuum residua, oils obtained from tar sands and residua derived from tar sand oil, and hydrocarbon streams derived from coal. Such hydrocarbon streams contain organometallic contaminants which create deleterious effects in varous refining processes that employ catalysts in the conversion of the particular hydrocarbon stream being treated. The metallic contaminants that are found in such feedstocks include, but are not limited to, iron, vanadium, and nickel. Nickel is present in the form of soluble organometallic compounds in most crude oils and residuum fractions. The presence of nickel porphyrin complexes and other nickel organometallic complexes causes severe difficulties ifs the refining and utilization of heavy hydrocarbon fractions, even if the concentration of such complexes is relatively small. It is known that a cracking catalyst deteriorates rapidly and its selectivity changes when in the presence of an appreciable quantity of the organometallic nickel compounds. An appreciable quantity of such organometallic nickel compounds in feedstocks that are being hydrotreated or hydrocracked harmfully affects such processes.The catalyst becomes deactivated and plugging or increasing of the pressure drop in a fised bed reactor results from the deposition of nickel compounds in the interstices between catalyst particles. Iron containing compounds and vanadium containing compounds are present in practically all crude oils that are associated with the high Conradsn carbon asphaltic and or asphaltenic portion of the crude. Of course, such metals are concentrated in the residual bottoms, when a crude is topped to remove those fractions that boil below about 2320C 4500F to 3160C 6000F . If such residuum is treated by additional processes, the presence of such metals adversely affects the catalyst in such processes. It should be pointed out that nickelcontaining compounds deleteriously affect cracking catalysts to a greater extent than do iron containing compounds.If an oil containing such metals is used as a fuel, the metals will cause poor fuel oil performance in industrial furnaces, since they corrode the metal surfaces of the furnaces. While metallic contaminants, such as vanadium, nickel, and iron, are often present in various hydrocarbon streams in rather small amounts, they are often found in concentrations in excess of 40 to 50 ppm by weight, often in excess of 1,000 ppm. Of course, other metals are also present in a particular hydrocarbon stream. Such metals exist as the oxides or sulfides of the particular metal , or they are present as a soluble salt of the particular metal, or they are present as high molecular weight organomctallic compounds, including metal naphthenates and metal porphyrins, and derivatives thereof. In any event, if the metals content of the feed stream is too large, the feed stream should be treated for demetallization prior to its being submitted to the refining processes of desulfurization, denitrogenation, hydrocracking, catalytic cracking, and the like. Broadly, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for the hydrodemetalization of a heavy hydrocarbon stream containing asphaltenes and a substantial amount of metals, which process comprises contacting said stream in a reaction zone under suitable conditions and in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst comprising one or more transition metals on a porous glass support having a surface area within the range of about 50 ni2 gm to about 300 m2 gm, a pore volume within the range of about 0.2 cc gm to about 0.8 cc gm, and an average pore diameter within the range of about 70 7 nm to about 450 45 nm . Typically, the glass support is in the form of glass beads, which can have any suitable diameter. Of course, the hydrocarbon stream can contain asphaltenes. A substantial amount of metals corresponds to at least 40 ppm total metals. A catalyst having a porous glass support, such as glass beads, can be used advantageously in a process for the hydrodemetallization of heavy hydrocarbon streams, such as petroleum hydrocarbon residual materials and tar sands. Such glass supports are stable to a temperature as high as 982 C l,8000F and should be impervious to various acids. Such a catalyst can be used to pretrear the residual material or tar sands to remove metals and to partially hydrotreat the asphaltenes to a lower asphaltene content. When the catalyst has become deactivated because of coke or metal deposits, it can be regenerated readily by burning in an oxygen containing atmosphere or by leaching with an acid to recover the accumulated materials.Since the glass support will not become dissolved in the presence of strong mineral acids, except hydrofluoric acid, it can be reused in a catalyst. The catalyst can be produced from glass beads of any dimension. Suitable glass beads have a diameter within the range of about 0.079 cm 1 32 in to about 0.316 cm 1 8 in . Such porous glass beads have the properties listed hereinabove. The porous beads can be impregnated easily with transition metal salts contained in aqueous or organic solvents. Typically, the catalytic composition that is employed in the process of the present invention may be prepared by impregnating one or more of the transition metals upon particles, e.g., beads of suitable dimen sion, of the porous glass support. Such Such impregnation may be accomplished with one or more solutions of heatdecomposable compounds of the appropriate metals. The impregnation may be a co impregnation when a single solution of the metals is employed. Alternatively, impregnation may be accomplished by the sequentialImpregnation of the various metals from two or more solutions of the heat decomposable compounds of the appropriate metals.The impregnated support is dried at a temperature of at least 121 C 2500F for a period of at least 1 hour and calcined in air at a temperature of at least 5380C 1,0000F for a period of time of at least 2 hours. Suitable transition metals that can be used in the catalyst that is employed in the process of the present invention are the metals of Group VIB o the PeriodicTable of Elements and the metals of Group VIII of thePeriodic Table of Elements. Any mention herein to thePeriodic Table of Elements refers to the Periodic Table presented on page 628 of liEESTER S SEVENTH N7Eli COLLEGIATE DICTIONAlY, G. C. Merriam Companv, Springfield, Massa chusetts, U.S.A. 1963 . Cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten are transition metals that are preferred for use in the catalyst that is employed in the process of the present invention. The metal or metals are present in th e elemental form, as oxides, as sulfides, or mixtures thereof.Group VIB metals, such as molybdenum and tungsten, when present, are present in an amount within the range of about 5 wt to about 20 wt , calculated as the trioxide of the metal and based upon the total catalyst weight. Group VIII metals, such as nickel and cobalt, when present, are present in an amount within the range of about 0.1 wt to about 5 wt , calculated as the oxide and based upon the total catalyst weight. Suitable operating conditions for the hydrodemetallization process of the present invention comprise an average catalyst bed temperature of about 3710C 7000F to about 4820C 9000F , a total pressure of about 3.55 MPa 500 psig to about 41.5 MPa 6,000 psig , a hydrogen partial pressure of about 3.45 MPa 500 psia to about 20.7 NPa 3,000 psia , a hydrogen flow rate or hydrogen 33 addition rate of about 178 m3 m3 1,000 SCFB to about 33 1,780 m m 10,000 SCFB , gas volumes are measured at 15.6 C and 101.3 kPa and an LHSV of about 0.2 to about 2.5 volumes of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst.Preferably, the operating conditions comprise an average catalyst bed temperature of about 3880C 7300F to about 4320C 8100F , a total pressure of about 8.4 MPa 1,200 psi to about 20.8 MPa 3,000 psig , a hydrogen partial pressure of about 8.3 MPa 1,200 psia to about 13.8 NPa 2,000 psia , a hydrogen flow rate or hydrogen addition rate of about 712 m3 m3 4,000 SCAB to about 1,424 m3 m3 8,000 SCFB , and an LHSV of about 0.4 to about 2.0 volumes of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst. A preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention is presented in the accompanying figure, which is a simplified flow diagram and does not show various pieces of auxiliary equipment, such as pumps, compressors, heist exchangers, and valves. Since one having ordinary skill in the art would recognize easily the need for and location of such ausiliary equipment, its omission is appropriate and facilitates the simplification of the figure. This process scheme is presented for the purpose of illustration only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Referring to the figure, a Jobo II 400 OF feed, containing about 3.7 wt sulfur and about 0.6 wt nitrogen and more than 570 ppm metals, is withdrawn from source 10 through line 11 into pump 12, whereby it is pumped through line 13. A hydrogen containing recycle gas stream, discussed hereinafter, is passed from line 14 into line 13 to be mixed with the hydrocarbon feed stream to form a mised hydrogen hydrocarbon stream. The mixed hydrogen hydrocarbon stream is then passed from line 13 into furnace 15 where it is heated to a temperature within the range of about 404dC 7600F to about 4160C 7800F . The heated stream is then passed through line 16 into reaction zone 17. Reaction zone 17 comprises one or more reactors, each of which contains one or more fised beds of catalyst. The catalyst comprises cobalt and molybdenum, their oxides, and their sulfides deposed on porous glass beads having a diameter of about 0.031 inch 0.079 centimeter and possessing the physical properties listed hereinabove. The operating conditions employed in this scheme comprise a hydrogen partial pressure of about 8.3 MPa 1,200 psia to about 11.0 MPa 1,600 psia , an average catalyst bed temperature within the range of about 404 C 7600F to about 4160C 780 F , an LHSV within the range of about 0.4 volume of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst to about 0.8 volume of hydrocarbon per hour per volume of catalyst, and a hydrogen recycle rate within the range of about 890 m3 m3 5,000 SCFB to about 1,424 m3 m3 8,000 SCFB . The effluent from reaction zone 17 is passed through line 18 into high temperature, high pressure, gas liquid separator 19, which is operated at reactor pressure and a temperature within the range of about 4040C 7600F to about 416 C 7800F . In separator 19, hydrogen containing gas is separated from the rest of the effluent. The hydrogen containing gas is passed from separator 19 through line 20. It is cooled and sent into lighthydrocarbon separator 21, wherein the condensed light hydrocarbons are separated from the hydrogen containing gas and withdrawn via line 22. The hydrogen containing gas is removed by way of line 23 and passed into scrubber 24, wherein the hydrogen sulfide is removed or scrubbed from the gas.The hydrogen sulfide is removed from the system by way of line 25. The scrubbed hydrogen containing gas is then passed through line 14 where it can be joined by make up hydrogen, if necessary, via line 26. The hydrogen containing gas stream is then added to the hydrocarbon feed stream in line 13, as described hereinabove. The liquid portion of the effluent is passed from the high temperature, high pressure, gas liquid separator 19 by way of line 27 to high temperature flash drum 28. In flash drum 28, the pressure is reduced to atmospheric pressure and the temperature of the material is within the range of about 371 C 700 F to about 427 C 8000F . In flash drum 28, any light hydrocarbons containing not only the naphtha but those distillates boiling up to a temperature of about 28sOC 5500F to 316 C 600 F , such as fuel oils, are flashed from the rest of the product and are removed from the system by way of line 29. Such light hydrocarbons can be separated into their various components and sent to storage or to other processing units. The heavier material that is separated from the light hydrocarbons, that iss material that boils at a temperature above about 3160C 6000 , present in an amount of about 30 wt ,o to about 90 wt4 o based upon the hydrocarbon feed, is removed from flash drunk 2S by way of line 30 for use as feeds to other processes or as a low sulfur, heavy industrial fuel. Such liquid material contains about 0.10 wt sulfur to about 1.0 wt sulfur and about 2 ppm to about 200 ppm nickel and vanadium. This liquid effluent is passed via line 31 to furnace 32, or other suitable heating means, to be heated to a temperature as high as 4270C 8000F . The heated stream from furnace 32 is passed by way of line 33 into vacuum tower 34, where vacuum gas oil VGO is separated from a low sulfur residual fuel. TheVGO is passed from vacuum tower 34 by way of line 35 to storage or to further processing units, such as a hydrodesulfurizer not shown , followed by a conventional catalytic cracking unit not shown . The low sulfur residual fuel is passed from vacuum tower 34 by way of line 36 to storage or to other processing units where it can be used as a source of energy. Alternatively, the material boiling above 3160C 6000F that is removed from flash drum 28 through line 30 can be sent by way of line 37 to a resid hydrodesulfurizer not shown and then to a resid catalytic cracking unit not shown . The following examples are presented to facilitate the understanding of the process of the present invention. They are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, but are presented for the purpose of illustration only. Example I A catalyst was prepared by impregnating 10 gm of glass beads obtained from PPG Industries, Inc., with 6 ml of an aqueous solution containing 0.05 gm of platinum as chloroplatinic acid H2PtC16 . All of the solution was taken up by the glass beads. The impregnated beads were then dried at a temperature of 121 C 2500F for a period of two hours and then calcined at a temperature of 5380C 1,000 F for a period of three hours.

This reactor was heated by an electrically heated steel bloc and had a concentric 1 8 inch O.D. thennowell extending up through the reactor. A movable thermocouple provided temperatures along the axis of the catalyst bed.The feed was pumped by a Ruska positive displacement pump through a line where it was blended with once through hydrogen and the resulting misture was.introduced into the reactor.The oil gas misture was passed over a fised catalyst bed within a heated reactor.

The regeneration included the burning of the coke from the surface of the porous glass beads, treating the material with acid to remove the metals, and reimpregnating the acid treated material with a nickelous nitrate solution. The coke was burned off of the porous glass beads by treating the coked beads in air for 3 hours at a temperature of 538 C 1,0000F . The gas charge flow rate that was employed during this coke burn was 0.043 m3 hr 1.5 ft3 hr . The material was then leached with a solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid to remove the metals from the surface. A 6 gln portion of the acid treated material was impregnated with a solution that had been prepared by dissolving 0.23 gin of nickelous nitrate in 5 ml of acetone. The impregnated material was then dried in air at a temperature of 121 C 2500F for a period of 3 hours and subsequently calcined in air at a temperature of 5380C 1,OPOOF for one hour. This regenerated catalytic material was prepared to contain 1 wt nickel oxide. It is identified hereinafter as Catalyst D.

The used catalyst was calcined in air for 3 hours at a temperature of 480 C 9000F , extracted with boiling concentrated hydrochloric acid, rinsed with acetone, dried in air for 3 hr at a temperature of 1210C 2500F , and calcined for 1 hr in air at a temperature of 5380C 1,0000 . The calcined material was found to have a surface area. of 178 m2igm. An emission spectrographi analysis showed the following 0.5 wt vanadium, 0.03 wt b nickel, and 0.02 wt iron. These data indicate that the glass had sufficient purity and high surface area to permit it to be reused for additional processing of residual hydrocarbons. The stability and regenerability of the catalyst that is employed in the process of the present invention is demonstrated by the above data. Such performance is contrary to that of conventional high surface area catalysts which are supported on high surface area refractory inorganic oxides, since such conventional catalysts decompose in strong acids and are, consequently, nonregenerable. The valuable metals found on these conventional catalysts, e.g., vanadium and nickel, cannot be recovered easily. The process of the present invention employs a reusable catalyst that should be more.economical, since the metals deposited thereon can be recovered by an easy process in which the catalytic support material is not destroyed. The results of this Test No. 2 demonstrate that the process of the present invention can demetallize effectively a Jobo II residual material.
