# Bulk polymerization of cycloolefins.

## Abstract
A process for bulk polymerizing a norbornenetype monomer, or a mixture thereof, that includes the steps of mixing the monomer with an organoammonium molybdate or tungstate catalyst and an alkoxyalkyl aluminum halide cocatalyst at a temperature at which polymerization of the monomer remains essentially dormant for at least one hour, and conveying the resulting mixture to a mold maintained at a temperature at which polymerization of the monomer takes place in less than about 2 minutes.
