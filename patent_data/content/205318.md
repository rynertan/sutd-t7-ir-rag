# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO THE CUTTING OF FLEXIBLE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described for use in cutting flexible material, for example cloth, and includes a source roll 26 of material M , means for drawing a length of material from the source to be laid upon an upwardly facing support surface 32 of a carrier device 28 , conveniently a drum, and means to cause relative movement between cutting equip ment T arranged above the support surface 32 and the material M laid on the surface. Thus a cut is made in the material according to a predetermined pattern. The material continues to be cut in a manner described and eventually is removed from the drum 28 by a take off arrangement 42, 52 .
