# Determination of terminal saccharide groups in glycoprotein.

## Abstract
A method of determining qualitatively and or quantitatively terminal saccharide groups in glycoproteins from body liquids having a microheterogeneity in the saccharide group or groups. The method comprises three steps 1 Binding of glycoprotein antibodies to a solid phase 2 Binding of glycoprotein from body liquid and from standard solutions with a defined composition of terminal saccharide groups to the product from step 1. 3 Binding of labeled lectin to the complex of antiglycoprotein, glycoprotein and solid phase from step 2. The amount of bound labeled lectin can then be measured in the product from step 3 or the amount of unbound marked lectin in the supernatant and possible wasing solutions can be measured. This amount is correlated to the amount of terminal saccharide groups in the glycoprotein and on the basis of this the amount of a glycoprotein component with a special composition of terminal saccharide groups can also be determined. The method can be used in medical diagnostics.

## Description
Determination of terminal saccharide groups in glycoprotein This invention relates to determination of various terminal saccharide groups in glycoprotein components from body liquid, said glycoprotein showing microheterogeneity in the saccharide group or groups. The term glycoprotein is intended to include glycopeptides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. The invention is especially intended for use with quantitative determination of terminal saccharide groups in glycoprotein components in body liquid from human beings, e.g. plasma, serum or saliva even if body liquid from animals of course can be analyzed. The invention can also be utilized for qualitative determination of said saccharide groups. By saccharide groups sugar groups are intended. Glycoproteins consist of at least one polypeptide portion and at least one carbohydrate portion. Glycoproteins are very frequent in biological tissues and liquids.Various globulins i.a. immunoglobulins , fibrinogen, transferrin, prothrombin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, hemoglobin, carcinoembryonic antigen CEA , a fetoprotein, orosmucoid, fetuin, ferritin, C reactive protein, prostatic acid phosphatase, mucoproteins, certain enzymes, serum a1 proteinase inhibitor etc. can be mentioned here. Certain known medically, clinically defineable states are accompanied by a changed microheterogeneity in the saccharide groups in glycoprotein from body liquid, i.e. one or more glycoprotein components with a certain composition of terminal saccharide groups are included in an abnormal amount. Such a clinical state is alcoholism. It is known that a prolonged, high alcohol consumption is accompanied by a selective, mostly marked increase of the amount of a transferrin component in serum, which component haslan,isoelectric pH value pI of 5.7 and is normally a minor portion about 3 of the total transferrin content. The principal.trans.ferrin component has a pI value of 5.4.An increased amount of the transferrin component having a pI value of 5.7 is consequently an indication of a prolonged, high alcohol consumption. The charge of pI being dependent of the amount of terminat sialic acid residues. At present such a transferrin abnormality is established by a method including isoelectric focusing followed by immunofixation and quantitative densitometry. As this method is time consuming and requires special equipment it is not suitable for clinical use on a large scale Subst Alcohol Actions Misuse 1 1980 , pages 247 252 . Other clinical conditions have also been correlated to small changes in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins. See e.g. Int J Cancer Res 22 1978 , pages 515 20 and Biochem Biophys Acta 458 1976 , pages 355 373. These articles discuss microheterogeneity in the carbohydrate portion of CEA and a fetoprotein, respectively, as a consequence of various diseases. It is consequently an object of the invention to develop a simple and sensitive method for qualitative and or quantitative determination of terminal saccharide groups in microheterogeneous glycoproteins which method is suitable for routine use on a large scale. According to the invention this object is achieved by a method characterized by the following steps 1 antibodies with a specificity to the glycoprotein to be determined are bound to a solid phase, an immunoadsorbent being formed 2 glycoproteins from samples of body liquid or from different standard solutions, which solutions each contain glycoprotein with a defined composition of terminal saccharide groups,are bound to the antibody of the immunadsorbent, an immunoadsorbent glycoprotein complex being formed 3 labeled lectin or lectin, which can be labeled, is incubated with the immunoadsorbent glycoprotein complex from step 2, in which complex one or more terminal saccharide groups in the glycoprotein has optionally been modified, which lectin during incubation is bound to the terminal saccharide group to be determined in the microheterogenic glycoprotein of the complex, after which the amount of lectin bound by the complex.from step 2 or the amount of lectin unbound by this complex is determined in a way known per se. The method of the invention can be given the ratio al name radio lectin immunoassay RLIA . The antibodies used in the first step of this method, i.e. immunoglobulins having specificity to a human glycoprotein to be analyzed, are prepared by methods based on technique previously described. Such methods include e.g.that the glycoprotein to be analyzed is injected into an animal where it will give rise to antibodies, i.e. immunoglobulins with the desired specificity, which are separated and purified in a way known per se. Many such antibody preparations are commercially available. In the first step according to the invention such immunoglobulins are bound to a solid phase by any suitable known technique. The invention is then not restricted to any special technique now known. Moreover, such methods can probably also be used as can possibly be developed in the future. In this connection a phase, which can be easily separated from a liquid phase making it possible to change and renew the liquid phase, is intended by a solid phase. The product obtained when the immunoglobulins are bound to a solid phase is called immunoadsorbent. This method of rendering the antibodies insoluble can be carried out in various manners, e.g. by covalent binding of antibodies to a solid matrix, such as particles of agarose e.g. Sepharose OR Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB,Sweden , cross linked dextran e.g. Sephadex ,. Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Sweden or cellulose. At covalent binding to hydroxyl group containing polymers such asSepharose gel the gel is preferably activated by means of cyanogen bromide under alkaline conditions before the addition of antibodies see e.g. US patent 3 645 852 .Also cross conjugation, incorporation in polyacrylamide gels or physical adsorption to activated carbon, glass or plastic surfaces, can be utilized for the inolubiliza tion. Due to the great number of methods available for insolubilization the reaction time, pH, temperature and other variables can be allowed to vary within wide limits.Of course each method has its permitted ranges of the variables. The essential thing is that the antibodies after the insolubilization retain completely or partly their antigen binding ability. The second step according to the invention comprising binding of glycoprotein to the immunoadsorbent can be carried out in such a way that the immunoadsorbent is incubated with the glycoprotein in solution or with the body liquid to be investigated. The body liquid can be diluted, if necessary. The incubation means that the glycoprotein is bonded to the antibody of the immunoadsorbent due to a biospecific affinity. The incubation can be carried out at a temperature of 10 to 500C conveniently 10 40 C and preferably 20 40 C, and at a pH value of 3 9, preferably 6 8. These conditions are not especially critical and suitable conditions can be easily established by one skilled in the art. The incubation time can vary from some minutes, e.g. 5 minutes, to a couple of hours or longer. Usually a time of maximum 2 hours. is enough. After the immunoadsorbent has been reacted with the glycoprotein to be investigated the solid phase may be washed. In the resulting complex terminal saccharide groups in the glycoprotein can be modified in respect of transferrin, e.g. by incubation with galactosidase, to N acetyl glycosamide, GlNac, and thereafter with N acetyl glycosaminidase to mannose. The third step according to the invention comprising binding of lectin to the immunoadsorbent antigen com plex from step 2 is carried out in a way known per se.The lectin then used is capable of being bound biospecifically to the terminal saccharide group which is to be determined in the microheterogenic glycoprotcin. The gel from step 2 is preferably incubated at a temperature of about 37 C for about 10 90 min. after which unbound lectin is removed. The incubation conditions are not specifically critical but about the same ranges of temperature, pH and time indicated above for step 2 can be used. The amount of lectin bound or, alternatively, not bound to terminal saccharide groups is then measured in a suitable manner. At labeling with an isotop a liquid scintillation counter or counter can be used. One advantage of the method of the invention is that very small amounts of glycoprotein are enough for utilization of the invention, as amounts below 1 nmol of terminal saccharide groups can be determined both quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, a resolving power of 30 pmoles saccharide has been achieved, which value can probably be improved if the test conditions are optimized. Glycoproteins which can be determined according to the invention are such as a give rise to formation of antibodies when injected into an animal, whereby an antibody fraction formed can be separated and purified, and b show microheterogeneity in the saccharide group or groups. It is then intended by microheterdgeneity that glycoproteins which are bound to the same antibody preparation can show different terminal saccharide groups in the saccharide portion. The terminal saccharide groups can e.g. consist of sialic acid, galactose, or mannose. Moreover, the terminal saccharide groups of these glycoproteins should not be antigen determinants, i.e. antibodies formed with a specificity to the glycoprotein should not react with terminal saccharide groups in the glycoprotein. An essential characteristic feature of the invention is the use of lectins for quantitative and or qualitative determination of different terminal saccharide groups in a microheterogenic glycoprotein. By lectins proteins, optionally glycoproteins, are intended, which can be obtained from animal or plant sources, and are. capable of binding to specific saccharide groups.Examples of such lectins are galactose binding lectin from Crotalaria juncea see Ersson, B., Afpberg, K. andPorath, J., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, volume 310 1973 , pages 446 452, and Ersson, B., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, volume 494 1977 , pages 51 60 , a podded plant, and a sialic acid binding lectin from the horseshoe crab,Limulus polyphemus. According to the invention labeled lectin or lectin, which can be labeled, is used in order that the terminal saccharide groups in the glycoprotein might be determined qualitatively and or quantitatively. Isotop labeling e.g.by means of iodine 1251 or 1311 can be used with advantage. Also other labeling methods which are known and frequently used in immunological and similar methods can be use As examples labeling if with enzmes or fluorescent dyestuffs, such as fluorescein or rhodamine, or diazotized dyestuffs, such as Evans blue, can be mentioned. By means of labeled lectin or lectin, which can be labeled, the content of the terminal saccharide groups of a microheterogenic glycoprotein, which are capable of being bound to the lectin, can be determined in a sample. This can be carried out by comparing the amount of lectin which is bound to the immunoadsorbent glycoprotein complex of a sample with the amount which is bound to the corresponding complex obtained if the immunoadsorbent instead of being reacted with a sample is reacted with standard solutions containing known contents of the glycoprotein with the terminal saccharide group which is to be determined quantitatively. Alternatively the amount of unbound lectin remaining in the ssupernatant and possibly in washing solutions can be measured. At isotop labeling of the lectin a liquid scintillation counter or counter is preferably used for determination of the amount of bound or free lectin. At labeling with fluorescent dyestuffs microspectroiluoro metry can e.g. be utilized for quantitative determination.By using different types of lectin bound to different terminal saccharide groups it is also possible to determine which terminal saccharide groups are included in a glycoprotein and possibly also in which ratio these are included. As to the conditions used when carrying out the different steps according to the invention these are not especially critical, as stated above. Conditions frequently used in immunological processes can be used. As stated above the method of the invention can be utilized with advantage at determination of a certain transferrin component occurring in an increased amount in serum from persons with a prolonged high consumption of alcohol. Therefore the invention is described in the following examples more in detail with reference to such a transferrin component determination. The results of these examples are compiled in diagrams on the enclosed drawings, Fig. 1 showing a diagram of analysis results obtained when using labeled. Crotalaria lectin and Figs. 2A and B showing diagrams of analysis results obtained by using labeled Limulus lectin. Example 1 Determination of asialotransferrin by means of Crotalaria lectin. A. Preparation of immunoadsorbent 25 ml of Sepharose 9 4 B washed with distilled water are suspended in 25 ml of re distilled water, and cooled to 20 0C and transferred to a beaker with magnetic stirring. 5 g of cyanogen bromide are added and the pHvalue is adjusted to and maintained at 11 by addition of ice cold sodium hydroxide solution 2 moles l The temperature is kept at 20 0C by means of crushed ice and after almost complete titration after about 15 min the gel is washed in an ice cooled Bchner funnel with ice cooled sodium phosphate buffer 0.07 moles l phosphate, pH 8.0 .This gel is added to an equal amount of antitransferrin solution Dako., Copenhagen, Denmark 10 mg ml at room temperature, and is allowed to stand at room temperature with magnetic stirring for 2 h.Ethanolamine HCl 1 mole l, pH 8.0 is then added 5 ml ml of gel and the mixture is incubated with stirring for additional 2 h. The buffer is exchanged by washing and centrifugation to 0.05 moles l of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 mole l sodium chloride. The gel is stored at 4 0C in an equal volume of this buffer. B. Formation of immunoadsorbent Rlycoprotein complex Standard solutions containing various percentages of asialotransferrin and transferrin are prepared by transferring 0.069 U agarose bound neuraminidase from Dactylium dendroides Sigma, S t Louis, Mo, USA having an activity of 44 U g of agarose 1 U releases 1 mole min of sialic acid from AcNeu lactose at pH 5.0 and 370C to sodium phosphate buffer 0.01 moleil, pH 6.3 . In this buffer 1 mg of human transferrin AB Kabi, Sweden is dissolved which is added to the agarose to a total volume of 1 ml and is incubated with shaking for 30 min at 37 0C. The agarose is pelleted at the bottom of the tube and asiolotransferrin is transferred to another tube. 1 mg of untreated transferrin is dissolved in the same buffer and standard solutions are prepared by mixing the asialotransferrin solution and the transferrin solution in various proportions. 10 ul of antitransferrin gel from A in a total volume of 20 ul of phosphate buffer 0.05 moles l, pH 7.5 containing sodium chloride 1 mole l are into duced into ice cooled plastic centrifuge tubes. Transferrin in the sample and standard solutions is in this example and example 2 in excess of the transferrin during incubation.This gel is thereafter incubated with shaking at 370C for 10 min with 1 different standard solutions of 50 ug of transferrin asialotransferrin of different composition in 50 ul of phosphate buffer 0,01 mole 1, pH 6,3 and 2 with samples of 100ul of serum from different persons after a preceding additon of 100,us sodium phosphate 0.05 moles l citrate 0.02 moles l , pH 7.2. The gel is then freed by washing from soluble transferrin. C Formation of immunoadsorbent glycoprotein lectin complex The gel is then incubated with 50 100 jug of 125it labeled Crotalaria lectin for 10 min in a thermostated shaking device at 37OC. Unbound lectin is removed from the pelleted gel, after which the latter is suspended in a buffer of 0.5 ml, is transferred to a scintillation container and counted in the presence of scintillation liquid Atuasol , NEN Chemicals, Germany . Crotalaria lectin had been labeled in the following way Crotalaria lectin was solubilized in sodium phosphate buffer 0.07 moles l, pH 8.0 to a concentration of 10 g l and the solution was cooled with ice. 0.09 nmoles of Bolton Hunter reagent NEN Chemicals, Germany 2200 Ci mmole were evaporated in nitrogen from a solution in 20 jul of anhydrous benzene in a glass centrifuge tube. About half the benzene volume was evaporated at room temperature for 10 min and the residue for 20 min after placing the tube in an ice bath. 5 pl of the Crotalaria lectin solution 50 tug of lectin were thereafter added from an ice cooled micropipette and it was left for 1 hour at 0 0C and then for 3 hours at 4 C. 1 mg of the Crotalaria lectin solution was then added and the macromolecular material was eluted from a Sephadex G 25 column PD 10, Pharmacia, Uppsala with a simultaneous buffer exhange to sodium phosphate 0.05 moles l, pH 7.5 containing sodium chloride 1 mole l . Fractions of 1 ml were collected. The lectin remained active for at least 4 months after storage at 4 0C in the latter buffer. Example 2 Determination of sialic acid as terminal group in transferrin. The method in example 1 was repeated except for the fact that 125I lsabeled sialic acid binding lectin from Limulus polyphemus was used in C instead of Crotalaria lectin. 0.1 ml of Na EDTA 0.1 mole l, pH 7.4 was first added to the immunoadsorbent transferrin complex prepared according to example 1A and 1B. Exchange of buffer toTris HCl 0.05 moles l, pH 7.2 containing NaCl 0.15 moles l and CaCl2 0.1 mole l was then carried out by washing. About 20 25 pg of labeled Limulus lectin dissolved in 0.1 ml of the latter buffer were then added followed by three washes. The Limulus lectin had been labeled as in example 1 exceptvfor the fact that labeling had been carried out at a lower concentration 1 g l and with a ratio of protein to Bolton Hunter reagent being one tenth of that used in example 1. After labeling the Limulus lectin was diluted with an equally great volume of Na EDTA 0.1 mole l, pH 7.4 and transferred to a buffer of Tris HCl 0.05 moles l, pH 7.2 , NaCl 0.15 moles l and CaCl2 0.1 mole l . The results from example 1 are shown in the diagram in Fig. 1. A molar ratio of transferrin to galactose binding lectin of about 1 1 has been used as presumably maximally only one lextin molecule can be bound to one of the galactose groups exposed in asialotransferrin. The measurements have been carried out in the range clinically interesting for investigation of persons alcohol habits, which is 0 15 of asial6trans ferrin based on total transferrin amount. In Fig. 1 two curves are shown as obtained withRLIA of terminal galactose groups in 1 standard solutions containing 50,ug of transferrin with an indicated ratio of asialotransferrin filled circles or in 2 100 M1 of serum containing an indicated ratio of the transferrin component with a pI of 5.7 unfilled circles . The standard X curve and three coordinates Q in the serum transferrin curve are authentic while other coordinates in the serum transferrin curve 0 represent values obtained from another preparation of antitransferrin gel, a correction equivalent to each coordinate being inserted for the higher background value of lectin binding to the latter gel. The background binding of the serum incubations was 8 9000 cpm at the first incubation, and 12500 cpm at the second incubation. The lectin bound on the latter incubation occasion corresponds to 10 15 of added lectin or 8 12 lug.About the same percentage of marked lectin is bound to partially hydrolyzed Sepharose containing an excess of terminal galactose residues, when the dilution ratio between marked and unmarked lectin is the same.Table of Fig. 1 incubation No. 2 Percentage of serum desialotransferrin Bound Crotalaria lectin with pI 5.7, determined by iso using the claimed method electric focusing Radio lectin immunoassay cpm 2 13300 200 4 13950 890 6 15660 8 15340 890 8 15980 1310 12 15730 13 16260 1840 14 17310 16 18690 160 It is apparent from Fig. 1 that the standard curve in the range of 0 to 15 t of asialotransferrin has about the same inclination as the curve obtained with serum samples in the range of 2 to 16 of the transferrin component with a pI 5.7.Moreover, such values lying in the lower left part of the serum curve, i.e. with a normal content of the transferrin component with pI 5.7, have been obtained with serum from persons having a low or normal alcohol consumption whereas values obtained with serum from persons with a high alcohol consumption lie in the upper right part of the serum curve, i.e. corresonding to a clearly increased amount of the transferrin component with pI 5.7. The results from example 2 are shown in Figs. 2A and 2B. These diagrams show the results from RLIA of terminal sialic acid in transferrin with labeled Limulus lec tin,10 p1 of antitransferrin Sepharose gel being incubated with 50Jug of transferrin containing untreated transferrin and completely desialylated asialotransferrin in indicated porportions, which gel has then been incubated with 25 pg of labeled Limulus lectin. It is apparent from these diagrams that transferrin will bind a significantly larger amount of Limulus lectin than asialotransferrin does. On the other hand, the asialotransferrin antitransferrin complex binds significant amounts of Limulus lectin. This is probably due to the fact that sialyl groups are included in the antibodies and contribute to the binding of Limulus lectin. Example 3 Determination of absolute concentration of asialotransferrin in serumstandaras A CNBr Activation of Sephacryl C 2 g Sephacryl 400, allyl dextran cross linked with N,N methylene bisacrylamide Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Sweden , was suspended in 40 ml potassium phosphate buffer 1,25 mol l, pH 11,7 at OOC, in an ice bath. 2 g cyanogen bromide Fluka AG, Switzerland was weighed and dissolved in 40 ml distilled water at 20 C. The cyanogen bromide solution was added gradually to the gel, using slow magnetic stirring. The components were allowed to react for 10 minutes at OOC, with continued slow stirring. The gel was then washed on a glass filter with 2 1 ice cold distilled water. Any free cyanogen bromide in the flask was eliminated by use of sodium hydroxide pellets. The gel was acidified by washing with 250 ml acetic acid 0,01 mol l . The gel was then suspended in distilled water and ultrasonicated for between 1 15 minutes, until a homo genous preparation was obtained. The gel was sucked dry on a glassfilter us ing 100 ml acetone. It was then transferred to a vacuum desiccator and allowed to dry under vacuum, until all traces of acetone smell had disappeared. The gel is stored dry at 4 C. B Coupling of antitransferrin to the activated gel 150 mg activated gel was added to a solution containing 1,25 ml antitransferrin 1,9 mg ml DAKO, Den mark . and 1,5 ml 0,05 mol l BICIN buffer pH 8,3 Sigma,US containing 0,02 NaN3, 0,1 t Tween 20, 0,5 mol lNaCl. This mixture was mixed thoroughly, then allowed to couple for 16 hours at 4 0C, using end over end rotation. Any excess active groups remaining on the gel after coupling were then blocked with 5 ml glycine 0,2 mol l dissolved in BICIN buffer pH 8,3 . The mixture was rotated end over end for 2 hours at room temperature. Next the gel was washed four times each, with alternately acidic and basic pH buffer solutions. Buffers used Acetate buffer 0,05 mol l pH 4,0, 1 mol l Nazi, 0,1 t Tween 20 . Tris HCl buffer 0,05 mol l pH 8,0, 1 mol l NaCl, 0,02 t NaN3, 0,1 Tween 20 . The gel was finally washed with phosphate buffer pH 7,4 0,04 mol l Na2HPO4 2H2O, 0,008 mol l KH2PO4, 0,16 mol l NaCl, 0,008 mol l NaN3, 0,1 t Tween 20 . The gel was stored in the same phosphate buffer in a volume ratio of gel buffer of 3 5. C Incubation of serumstandards with the immunoad sorbent Standard solutions containing varying amounts of asialotransferrin were prepared by adding, to a serum pool with known quantitites of asialotransferrin and total transferrin, differing amounts of neuraminidase treated transferrin as described in an earlier example . 60 pl antitransferrin gel from B in a total volume of 100 jil phosphate buffer is placed in a series of test tubes. The various serum standard solutions were diluted five times with saline buffer above described phosphate buffer . 100 ul of each was added, then incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with shaking. This means that the available antigenbinding sites on the immunoadsorbent are in excess of the tranferrin during incubation. Any unbound transferrin was washed from the gel with three washes of 2 ml phosphate buffer 0.05 ml l Nla2HPO4, pH 7,5, 1 mol l Nail, 0,1 t Tween 20,polyoxyethylene sor bitan monolaurate, Atlas Chemie, Germany . D Incubation with Crotalaria lectin The gel was labelled with 20 g 1251 Crotalaria lectin in a 100 jul volume per tube. The tubes were then incubated, with shaking for 60 minutes at 370 C. Unbound lectin was washed off with 4 x 2 ml phos phate buffer. Radioactivity of the gel was then measured with a counter for 2 minutes.
