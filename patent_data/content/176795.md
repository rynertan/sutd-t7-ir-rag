## Description
The present invention relates to a method for cracking a heavy oil containing heavy metals and at least 1 by weight of asphaltene. Recently, hydrogenolysis of heavy fraction oils has increasingly been of importance. There have been proposed many methods for thermal cracking, catalytic cracking, and hydrogenolysis, etc. The heavy fraction oils referred to herein are hydrocarbon oils containing 50 wt. or more of a fraction boiling above 350 C, particularly those containing 1.0 wt. or more of pentane insoluble ingredients. For example, they include residual oils yielded by atmospheric or vacuum distillation of crude oils, or oils produced from coal, oil sand, oil shale, bitumen or the like. The term cracking herein is intended to obtain light fraction oils including naphtha and gasoline fractions, and, kerosene and light oil fractions. In the general hydrogenation treatment of heavy fraction oils, the reduction of catalytic activity is the most serious problem technically or economically. Namely, the heavy fraction oil contains an asphaltene fraction which contains heavy metals such as vanadium and nickel. These metals severely deteriorate catalysts and hinder economical and continuous long term uses of the catalysts. Many efforts for improving catalysts have been exerted to solve such a problem, and many improved catalysts have been proposed but they are not thoroughly satisfactory. In addition, though there have been proposed many elaborate contributions to improve a reaction device, there are still many problems to be solved. Moreover, the cost of hydrogen is an important factor economically and technically. In the hydrotreatment of heavy fraction oils, the amount of consumption of hydrogen may be increased as a starting oil is heavier, thus costing a great deal. As one of methods which solve the problem of such hydrogen cost, there is known a method in which a hydrogen donative compound yielded by hydrogenating a polycyclic aromatic compound is used for example, US A 4,430,197 . When the hydrocracking of a heavy fraction oil is effected with use of such a hydrogen donative compound, it is also well known that a catalyst is not necessarily needed and the hydrocracking reaction proceeds in an atmosphere of hydrogen gas at a relatively low pressure for example, US A 4,294,686 and Oil Gas Journal, Nov. 22, 1982, Pages 111 through 116 . The hydrogen donative solvent described above is a compound yielded by hydrogenating a hydrocarbon compound having polycyclic aromatic rings such as naphthalene and anthracene. It is well known that such a hydrogen donor liberates a hydrogen atom at high temperatures for example, above 380 C . There have also been accordingly proposed many trials to take advantages of said liberation nature industrially for example, US A 2,953,513 . It is also well known that such a hydrogen donative material is included in a thermally cracked oil, catalytically cracked oil, and hydrogenated oil from a heavy fraction oil, serving as an effective hydrogen donor in itself for example, US A 3,970,545 . However, the cracking reaction in these methods is effectively performed only at relatively high temperatures, resulting in deposition of carbonaceous materials causing a problem called coking. US A 3 957 619 describes a process for the conversion including upgrading of solid carbonaceious materials, and in particular for the hydrogenation of coal slurries. The process comprises passing a slurry composed of solid carbonaceous material and solvent, together with hydrogen through a reaction vessel that contains a plurality of reaction zones separated by porous partitions. A portion of said zones is adapted to contain a solid particulate hydrogenation catalyst which will not pass through said porous partitions. The remainder of said zones forms substantially unobstructed passageways through said reaction vessel. The volumetric proportion of substantially unobstructed passageways through said reaction vessel. The volumetric proportion of substantially unobstructed passageways to catalyst zones is preferably from about 20 1 to about 1 10. According to a preferred embodiment of this prior art anthracene oil is employed as a hydrogen donative solvent in a hydrogenation reaction. The oil is mixed with the solid carbonaceous material. Hydrogenation with desulfurisation is the only process exemplified. When the charge to the reactor was liquid Example X, wherein a Kuwait Vacuum Bottoms was subjected to different hydrogenation conditions it was found that desulfurisation in a fixed bed where the total catalyst was used to fill the entire lower half of the reactor was more effective than in the zoned reactor. In view of the drawbacks of the conventional methods for hydrogenating heavy fraction oils, it is an object of the present invention to provide a more effective method for cracking heavy fraction oils in which is solved a problem as to an increased pressure loss caused by coking in a cracking tower reaction tower when treating the heavy fraction oils containing 1.0 wt. or more of asphaltene. It is the object of the present invention to provide a method for cracking heavy fraction oils containing 1.0 wt. or more of asphaltene with little reduction of catalyst activity, reduced consumption of hydrogen and high cracking efficiency. According to the present invention, the interior of a cracking tower is vertically divided into at least two portions with a partition for housing a solid catalyst having a hydrogenation function, and the divided portions are communicated with each other at the upper and lower parts thereof. A starting heavy fraction oil containing heavy metals and at least 1 by weight of asphaltine, a hydrogen donative solvent, and a hydrogen containing gas are introduced into at least one of the divided portions at the lower part of said at least one portion, and further the fluid so introduced is circulated between the divided portions. The method described above serves to relieve the problem of coking, and to effectively crack heavy fraction oils. It should be noted here that cracking with use of a hydrogen donor does not require a catalyst and it can be effected without a catalyst in many cases. The present inventor has found the following facts experimentally Namely, when cracking heavy fraction oils with the aid of a hydrogen donor, the presence of a slight catalytic action is effective, for which a solid catalyst can be the most conveniently used. Although the solid catalyst may be used in a fixed bed form, the use thereof is likely to cause blockage or clogging. With such an occurence the flow rate of a fluid is insufficient, and the fluid and gas are prevented from flowing due to carbonaceous materials produced, resulting in accumulation of the carbonaceous materials followed by causing blockade. To avoid this, it is considered to fluidize the catalyst for use. However, when heavy fraction oils are generally cracked using a hydrogen donor solvent, the catalyst in the form of very fine particles should be employed to produce a uniform flow of the catalyst with use of the starting oil, the hydrogen donor and the gas. With the use of such fine particles, it is difficult to separate these particles from the resulting reaction products. When there are used relatively large particles for example, more than 0.1 mm which are possible to separate from the reaction products, a high fluid flow rate is required to fluidize these particles. However, it is impossible to obtain such a high flow rate only by the use of the starting oil and the hydrogen donor. Accordingly, for this purpose, it is necessary to recycle the reaction products. The recycling will be the cause for complication of an apparatus to be installed and for an increase in construction cost thereof. According to the present invention, a required flow velocity can be obtained by causing a natural circulating flow in a cracking tower and thereby avoiding any clogging with carbonaceous materials, while an effective cracking reaction can be conducted by allowing a catalyst having a hydrogenating function to exist in the cracking tower thereby causing the cracking reaction effectively and enabling the production of carbonaceous materials to be greatly reduced. Another method for hydrocracking heavy hydrocarbon oils containing 1.0 wt. or more of asphaltene, comprises the two steps 1 and 2 One characteristic of the cracking method just described above according to the present invention, is to treat heavy fraction oils as described hereinabove in the two steps by the use of the hydrocracked oil functioning itself as a hydrogen donor since the hydrocracked oil contains the original hydrogen donor compound. The present inventor has revealed that when the heavy fraction oils were cracked with use of a hydrogen donative solvent, metals such as vanadium and nickel are in a state in which they can be removed. Consequently, by cracking heavy fraction oils with use the hydrogen donative solvent and removing metals in the first step, there are obtained oils which have been cracked to some extent while the metals have been almost removed therefrom. Thus, in the second step, the reduction of catalytic activity may be remarkably lessened and the operational conditions are enabled to be remarkably mild. The methods according to the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figs. 1 through 3 are respectively longitudinal and cross sectional views of a cracking tower used in the present invention. Numeral 1 is an introduction tube for introducing a starting oil, a hydrogen donative solvent and a hydrogen containing gas, and 2 a partition for housing a solid catalyst with a hydrogenating function. The partition 2 in Fig. 1 is cylindrically shaped around the tube 1. The partition 2 in Fig. 2 comprises two plates around the introduction tube 1. The partition 2 in Fig. 3 is plate shaped, on one side of which is provided the introduction tube 1. Numeral 3 is a foamy hydrogen containing gas rising in a cracking tower, 4 an outlet pipe for discharging cracked fluid produced by cracking and the hydrogen containing gas, and 5 a cracking tower. In Fig. 1 a , H indicates the height of the cracking tower 5, h the height of the cylindrical partition 2, Di the inside diameter of the cracking tower 5, do the outside diameter of the cylindrical Partition 2, di the inside diameter of the cylindrical partition 2, and 1 the distance between the lower end part of the cylindrical partition 2 and an air space in the cracking tower 5. In Fig. 2, two of the plate shaped partitions 2 are provided around the introduction pipe 1 and the outlet pipe 4. Both side ends of each of the partition 2 are substantially brought into contact with the side surface of the cracking tower 5, and the upper and lower side ends thereof are communicated with each other on the upper and lower parts thereof. In Fig. 3, one sheet of the plate shaped partition 2 is employed to provide the introduction pipe 1 and the outlet pipe 4 on one side thereof. Both of the side ends of the partition 2 are brought into contact with the wall surface of the cracking tower 5, and the upper and lower side ends thereof are communicated with each other at the upper and lower parts thereof. Figs. 4 a and b show by way of example partitions 2 usable in the present invention, a a cylindrical one 2 and b a plate shaped one 2. Next, the method according to the present invention will be described below with reference to Fig. 1. A starting oil, a hydrogen donative solvent and a hydrogen containing gas are introduced through the introduction pipe 1 provided on the lower part of the cracking tower 5. The interior of the cracking tower 5 is vertically divided into two parts by the cylindrical partition 2 including a solid catalyst housed therein, and the aforesaid two parts are commumicated with each other on the upper and lower parts of the partition 2. It is preferable for the introduced hydrogen containing gas 3 to be introduced toward the inner part of the cylindrical partition 2 so as not to flow into the outside portion of the partition 2. The same is also applied to the heavy fraction oil and the hydrogen donative solvent. The foamy hydrogen containing gas 3 ascends the interior of the partition 2. With such construction, the fluid in the cracking tower 5 is circulated in the direction of an arrow shown in the figure due to the intra tower pressure unbalance caused by the small specific gravity of a region in which the hydrogen containing gas 3 exists. A part of the above described circulating fluid is capable of passing through the solid catalyst housed partition 2 from the outside of the partition 2 the side on which the hydrogen containing gas 3 is not existent to the inside thereof the side on which the gas is existent in the direction shown by an arrow dotted line . The amount of passage of the fluid changes depending on the pressure balance between the outside and inside of the partition 2. The void ratio of the partition 2 preferably ranges from 5 to 95 in general. The void ratio used herein is the proportion of a portion existing as a space in a unit volume. With such arrangement where a cylinder as the partition 2 is inserted in the cracking tower 5, it is made possible to yield a circulating flow inside the tower, assure a required flow velocity, and avoid any blocking in the cracking tower 5 caused by carbonaceous materials therein. The hydrogen containing gas 3 rises in the cylindrical partition 2 and is exhausted from the outlet pipe 4, while the fluid circulates in the cracking tower 5 and, after a prescribed residence time, is discharged from the outlet pipe 4. Accordingly, the fluid which resides for a prescribed period of time under conditions of a prescribed temperature and pressure can be cracked and made lighter fractions. At this point, the fluid contacts with the catalyst in the cylindrical partition 2 while circulating in the cracking tower 5, so that the cracking may be more effectively effected with the attendant remarkable reduction of production of carbonaceous materials as compared with a case in which no catalyst is used. To obtain a satisfactory circulating flow with the structures of the cracking tower 5 and cylindrical partition 2, the symbols indicated in Fig. 1 should preferably be in the following relationships The partition for housing a solid catalyst according to the present invention is porous as a whole, one part or the whole of which being composed of the solid catalyst having a hydrogenation function, while it is generally porous plane plate or curved plate shaped as a whole. A part or the whole of the plate is formed by an assembly of solid catalyst particles having a hydrogenation function. The partition may be illustrated by those prepared by housing at least one kind of particulate catalyst selected from extrusion molded catalyst, spherical catalyst and compression molded catalyst, in a metal mesh, punching metal or the like, and may also be illustrated by an assembly of catalyst particles bonded to each other with a binder. The thickness of the partition for housing a solid catalyst is 1 200 to 1 5, preferably 1 100 to 1 10, of the inside diameter of the reaction tower. The sizes of openings of the metal mesh and punching metal for housing a solid catalyst are such that solid catalyst particles do not pass through the openings and the fluid may sufficiently contact with the catalyst particles. The amount of catalyst used in the present invention ranges from 1 100 to 1 1.5, preferably 1 50 to 1 2, of the internal volume of the cracking tower. The solid catalyst is not particularly limited only if it is one having a hydrogenation function such for example as hydrocracking, hydrodemetallization, hydrodesulfurization or hydrodenitrification. But, from the viewpoint of long term operation, the preferable catalyst is one which will not remarkably decrease in activity due to vanadium, nickel and the like contained in starting oils even if it has originally low activity. For example, there can be used the same catalysts as employed in a heavy fraction oil treating process such as hydrocracking, hydrodesulfurization or hydrodenitrification for heavy fraction oils, or there can also be employed such catalysts already used. In addition, it is possible to add a small quantity of a new catalyst to the above described catalysts or to also use catalysts having relatively low activity instead of the above described used catalysts. The solid catalysts include oxides or sulfides of a Group VIII metal such as nickel or cobalt or of a Group VI B metal such as molybdenum or tungsten, the metal oxides or sulfides being carried on an inorganic substance such as alumina, silica, silica alumina, alumina boria, silica alumina magnesia, silica alumina titania, or natural or synthetic zeolite. Although the solid catalyst is not particularly limited in shape, for example an extrusion molded catalyst, a spherical catalyst or a compression molded catalyst may be used. The diameter of the catalyst particle ranges from 0.01 to 10 mm, preferably 0.1 to 5 mm. Operating conditions used in the present invention are as follows reaction temperature, 380 to 470 C reaction pressure, 30 to 150 kg cm² G 2942 to 8826 KPa varying depending on the kind of hydrogen containing gas residence time of starting heavy fraction oil in the cracking tower, preferably 0.2 to 10 hours circulating flow speed of the fluid in the cracking tower, at least 1 cm sec., preferably 5 to 100 cm sec. In this way, 30 wt. or more of heavy metals such as vanadium and nickel, etc., contained in a starting heavy fraction oil can be adhered to the catalyst in the cracking tower. The starting oils used in the present invention are heavy fraction oils containing at least 1.0 wt. , preferably 5 to 30 wt. , of asphalten pentane insoluble ingredients , preferably 5 to 30 wt. and comprising at least 50 wt. of a fraction boiling above 350 C One of preferable hydrogen donative solvents used in the present invention is a hydride of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are illustrated by those having 2 to 6 rings, preferably 2 to 4 rings and the derivatives thereof. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be used singly or in combination. There can be listed, as examples of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, naphthacene, chrysene, benzopyrene, perylene, picene and the derivatives thereof. In addition, the hydrogen donative solvents according to the present invention further include the hydrides of hydrocarbon oils containing at least 30 wt. of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and boiling in the range of 150 to 1500 C. As examples of the hydrocarbon oils, there can be listed various products obtained from petroleum such as a cycle oil from a cat cracker FCC , a bottom oil from a catalytic reformer or a thermally cracked oil of naphtha, or various products such as tar oil, anthracene oil, creosote oil and coal liquefied oil, each being produced from coal. The hydrogen containing gases used in the present invention are preferably those containing at least 70 wt. of hydrogen gas and include hydrogen containing gases from a reformer. Another method for cracking heavy fraction oils according to the present invention will be further detailed below with reference to Figs. 5 and 6. Fig. 5 is an example of a flow chart illustrating execution of the method according to the present invention. In Fig. 5, numeral 1 is a cracking tower, 2 hydrogenation tower, 3 a separation device, 4 an introduction passage for a starting heavy fraction oil, 5 an introduction passage for hydrogen gas, 6 and 7 effluent passages for reaction product mixtures in the cracking and hydrogenation towers, respectively, 8 a recycling flow passage for a hydrogen donative solvent from the separation device 3 to the cracking tower, and 9 and 10 product effluent passages from the separation device. The starting heavy fraction oil is passed, together with a recycled hydrogen donative solvent from the recycle flow passage 8, to the cracking tower 1 where the cracking is effected using the hydrogen donative solvent. The reaction in the cracking tower is carried out at preferably 380 470 C. The supply of hydrogen to the cracking tower is effected by the hydrogen donative solvent and, therefore, it is not necessarily required to supply hydrogen gas, particularly high pressure one, from other sources. However, in order to prevent coking and make conveniently the hydrogen pressure in the cracking tower equal to that in the hydrogenation tower which is required to be high, it is preferable to introduce hydrogen gas usually from the hydrogen gas introduction passage 5 to the cracking tower and effect the reaction under a hydrogen gas pressure of 30 150 kg cm² G. In conventional cracking with use of a hydrogen donative solvent, it is a common practice to effect a reaction in a cracking tower in the blank state. Namely, a hydrogen donative solvent and starting oil each at a high temperature are introduced into a tower or a vessel in the blank state without being charged with fillers and the like where the cracking of the oil is effected in the presence of hydrogen liberated by the hydrogen donative solvent. In contrast, one of the characteristics of the method according to the present invention is that the solid catalyst, porous solid or both are placed in the cracking region employing the hydrogen donative solvent and then vanadium and nickel which are made apt to be removed due to cracking are allowed to adhere to the solid materials. Further, the method according to the present invention is characterized in that cracked products from the cracking tower and the hydrogen donative solvent liberating hydrogen in the cracking tower are both directly introduced into the hydrogenation tower. But, the catalyst and or the porous material existing in the cracking tower is not introduced into the hydrogenation tower. Namely, the whole contents called a reaction product mixture in the cracking tower after the reaction except the solid catalyst and porous solid are introduced into the hydrogenation tower. As described above, in the present invention, unlike in conventional methods, the cracked products from the cracking tower are not separated by distillation and the used hydrogen donative solvent is not hydrogenated separately, but these cracked products and solvent are passed through the passage 6 from the cracking tower 1 to the hydrogenation tower 2 where the hydrogen donative solvent and the cracked products are hydrogenated in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. The hydrogenation in the hydrogenation tower is quite the same as that effected by the conventional fixed floor system. The hydrogenation tower effects hydrogenation at a reaction temperature of 300 to 450 C and a hydrogen pressure of 30 to 150 kg cm² G in the downstream flow in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. Since the starting heavy fraction oil has been hydrocracked in the cracking tower, an operating condition may be mild in the hydrogenation tower. In addition, since the metals have been removed in the cracking tower, the catalytic activity will little decrease in the hydrogenation tower. The hydrogen donative solvent is regenerated or hydrogenated due to hydrogenation in the hydrogenation tower to recover its hydrogen donative nature, while the cracked products are hydrogenated are refined to remove the impurities such as sulfur containing and nitrogen containing ingredients. The reaction product mixture in the hydrogenation tower, i.e., the whole contents in this hydrogenation tower except the solid catalyst, is fed The hydrogen donative solvent described above is not required to be previously hydrogenated before being introduced into the apparatus. Namely, it is hydrogenated in the hydrogenation tower to provide a new hydrogen donative solvent. The solid catalyst and or porous solid used in the cracking tower of the present invention is intended not only to crack heavy fraction oils, but also to collect metals, which are made apt to be removed due to cracking, by allowing them to adhere to the solid materials. In addition, it is preferable that the solid catalyst and the porous solid have high capability of attaching such metals thereto. As the porous materials, there can be listed alumina, silica alumina, ceramics, carbonaceous materials, clay and the like, which are inexpensive. There is set no particular limitation on a catalyst used for in the hydrogenation tower of the present invention. Namely, catalysts generally used in hydrogenation treatment can be used for respective desired purposes. What types of catalysts may be used is dependent on the composition and properties of a starting oil to be used and desired products to be obtained. Such reactions as effected in the first and hydrogenation towers in the present invention, although they may be executed in two separate towers, they may also be effected in one tower by dividing it into two areas for reaction, one area being for the first step reaction cracking and the other for the second step reaction hydrogenation . The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of illustrative examples. The first hydrocracking method for heavy fraction oils according to the present invention will be described below experimentally for Arabian reduced pressure residual oil with reference to the cracking tower in Fig. 1. There are shown the properties of starting oils in Table 1, the operating conditions in Table 2, and the dimensions of the cracking towers in Table 3. A cylindrical partition is provided by housing an 1 32 inch 0.0008m extrusion molded catalyst composed of cobalt 3.6 wt. and molybdenum 10.7 wt. carried on a silica alumina carrier pore volume 0.55 cc g , surface area 93 m² g , average pore radius 62 Å in a cylindrical metal mesh. The starting oil listed in Table 1 and a hydrogen donative solvent tetralin are introduced in a weight ratio of 1 1 into a cracking tower at the lower part thereof, while hydrogen gas is introduced into the cracking tower at the lower part thereof. They are permitted to ascend only in the cylindrical partition along it. The resulting reaction products are recovered, and the tetralin is separated, and thereafter the properties of the products are measured. Although the operation of the apparatus is continuously executed for 1300 hours, there is found no increase of pressure loss. The properties of the resultant products are listed in Table 1, and the mass balance and consumption of hydrogen in Table 4. The cylindrical partition was removed from the apparatus shown in the Example 1, and the same starting oil was treated under the same conditions. The operation was interrupted after 420 hours because of a great increase in pressure loss. The properties of a product obtained during the operating time were shown in Table 1, and the mass balance and consumption of hydrogen shown in Table 4. The following results were obtained from Tables 1 to 4. Khafuji reduced pressure residual oil was experimentally cracked by the method of the present invention. In the cracking tower, a direct desulfurization catalyst for atmospheric pressure residual oil which had been industrially already employed for about 8,000 hours was used as a downstream fixed bed. In the hydrogenation tower, there was used an 1 16 inch 0.0016m extrusion molded catalyst composed of cobalt 3.5 wt. and molybdenum 12.0 wt. carried on a silica alumina carrier pore volume 0.6 cc g, surface area 190 m² g, average pore radius 65 Å 6.5nm . As a reaction apparatus, there were used the cracking and hydrogenation towers which were each 40 mm in inside diameter and 1,300 mm in length. Each tower was filled with said catalyst so as to provide 1,000 mm of filling length. The starting oils and hydrogen gas as indicated in Table 5 were heated with a heater, and fed to the cracking tower in a downstream flow. As the hydrogen donative solvent, the bottom oil from a reforming device having the properties shown in Table 8 was employed, and make up was used in amounts of 20 wt. of the starting oil. The gas and liquid effluent from the hydrogenation tower were passed to a vapor liquid separator where they were separated from each other, and thereafter the liquid was passed to a rectifying tower to recover fractions boiling in the range of from 25 to 350 C for recycled use as a hydrogen donative solvent. The amount of solvent recycled was 1.5 times as large as that of the oil. The hydrogen gas was, after separated through the vapor liquid separator, partly recycled and the remainder was mixed with make up hydrogen and thereafter fed, together with the starting oil and the circulating solvent, through a heater into the cracking tower. The operation was conducted for 2,500 hours in succession. The properties of the treated starting oil and those of the products were shown in Table 5. The operating conditions were shown in Table 6. The mass balance in the present experiment was shown in Table 7. Variation in cracking rates with the lapse of time was shown in Fig. 6. The rate of cracking was defined as follows In addition, in order to estimate a rate of demetallization in the cracking tower, a liquid sample was collected and amounts of metals were measured. The result was listed in Table 9. The same starting oil, apparatus, and catalyst as used in Example 2 were employed in this comparison test to conduct a hydrogenation experiment by making use of a prior fixed bed reaction device. But, the same cracking and hydrogenation towers were each charged with the same catalyst as charged in the hydrogenation tower in Example 2. There were not conducted addition of any hydrogen donative solvent to the reaction system and recycling thereof. Namely, a prior hydrocracking method using hydrogen and a proper catalyst was employed. The operation was continuously conducted for 2,500 hours, and the results were compared with those obtained in Example 2. The operating time was listed in Table 6 as well as the product properties and mass balance in Tables 5 and 7. The cracking rates varying with the lapse of time were shown in Fig. 6. In addition, the starting oil and hydrogen gas were charged downstream as in Example 2. Further, the cracking rate and demetallization rate at the outlet of the cracking tower were shown in Table 9. Advantages of the method for cracking heavy fraction oils with use of a hydrogen donative solvent according to the present invention are as follows Likewise, advantages of the method for cracking a heavy fraction oil according to the present invention by making use of a solid catalyst and porous solid are as follows
