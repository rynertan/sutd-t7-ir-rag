## Description
DESCRIPTION AN AMINOGLYCOSIDIC ANTIBIOTIC SALT This invention relates to an aminoglycosidic antibiotic salt with educed toxicity. Aminoglycosidic antibiotics such as dibekacin 3 , tobramycin 3 deoxyRanamycin B , 4 dideoxykanamycin B gentamicln, kanamycin bekanamycin kanamycin B , amikacin and neomycin are widely used as antibacterial agents which are very effective for clinical treatment of the infections caused by Gram positive, Gram negative and acid fast bacteria.However, it has been reported that these antibiotics, when administered to patients suffering from renal failure or other diseases, may induce disorders in the auditory organ or kidney, and as a result, such antibiotics have found only limited utility in clinical applications. Thus, an agent for reducing the disorders in the auditory organ and kidney induced by aminoglycosidic antibiotics or an aminoglycosidic antibiotic with reduced toxicity has long been desired. As a result of studies into the possibility of reducing the toxicity of aminoglycosidic antibiotics, it has now been found that a D glucaro 1,5 lactam salt of an aminoglycosidic antibiotic produced by havingD glucaro 1,5 lactam act upon the aminoglycosidic antibiotic is less toxic than the aminoglycosidic antibiotic per se Accordingly, the invention resides in one aspect in an aminoglycosidic antibiotic salt comprising an aminoglycosidic antibiotic associated with D glucaro l, 5 lactam. In a further aspect, the invention resides in an anti microbial pharmaceutical composition including, as a main ingredient, a salt of aminoglycosidic antibiotic and D glucaro l, 5 lactam in such an amount that the salt exhibits the intended antibiotic effect but has reduced toxicity as compared with the aminoglycosidic antibiotic per se. D glucaro 1,5 Lactam having the following formula EMI3.1 is already disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication 28,375 70. As its formula suggests, the D glucaro 1, 5 lactam has a strong carboxylic acid group which renders it acidic and, therefore, it reacts readily with the amino group of an aminoglycosidic antibiotic in a solution and forms a salt. To be more specific, an addition of a D glucaro 1,5 lactam aqueous or watercontaining methanol solution to an aminoglycoside aqueous or water containing methanol solution results in immediate formation of a salt thereof at room temperature. The salt may also be produced by having a calcium or barium salt of D glucaro 1,5 lactam act on an aminoglycoside sulfate and removing the calcium or barium sulfate precipitated.The amount of the D glucaro 1,5 lactam added varies with the number of the amino groups of the aminoglycoside and with the pH of the solution of the resulting salt, 2 to 5 moles of the lactam generally being used per mol of the aminoglycoside. The molar ratio of the lactam to glycoside should be relatively large for aminoglycosidic antibiotics having 5 to 6 amino groups such as dibekacin, tobramycin, gentamicin, bekanamycin and neomycin, whereas the ratio should be relatively small for aminoglycosidic antibiotics having 4 amino groups such as kanamycin A and amikacin. An increased amount of D glucal 1,5 lactam is necessary for preparing a weak acidic sal√ß within the pharmaceutically acceptable pH values and hence the molar ratio of the lactam to glycoside is not necessarily an integer.One reason for the variation in the molar ratio of the lactam to glycoside is that an aminoglycoside in the form of a free base often absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide gas, and this results in a decrease in the amount of D glucaro 1, 5 lactam to be added to the aminoglycoside. The salt of the aminoglycoside and D glucaro 1, 5 lactam hereinafter referred to the compound of this invention is generally isolated in the form of a powder by concentrating a solution containing the compound of this invention to dryness, freeze drying the solution, or forming a precipitate from the solution by addition of ethanol or acetone.

An injection may be a dry product which can be rendered liquid by being dissolved in water or any other suitable vehicle prior to use. A liquid preparation such as an aqueous solution, oily suspension or emulsion may also be used as an injection. Suitable aqueous vehicles are sterile distilled water and physiological saline solution, and suitable nonaqueous vehicles are a vegetable oil such as sesame oil, an animal oil such as squalene, or propylene glycol. A preferred suspension is a 1 0 suspension. The liquid preparation ma contain a suspending agent such as methyl cellulose, an emulsifying agent such as lecithin, a preservative such as methyl p iiydroxybenzoate, or a conventional stabilizer. For rectal infusion, the antimicrobial composition preferably takes a form of a suppository which may use cocoa butter or other glycerides as a base. For oral administration, a tablet, capsule, powder, dry syrup or a liquid preparation such as syrup is conveniently used. The tablet or capsule may contain a binder such as gelatin, a filler such as calcium phosphate, a lubricant such as talc, a disintegrator such as potato starch, or a wetting agent such as sodium lauryl sulfate in the conventional manner. For local administration, these liquid preparations or ointment is used convenientlt. Since D glucaro 1,5 lactam hac no effect on the antibacterial activity of the compound of this invention, the amounts of the conventional aminoglycosides as calculated for clinical use in terms of antibacterial potency can serve a direct substitute for the dosage of the compound of this invention. A high dose of the compound of this invention can be administered without inducing any sideeffect to the patients who require a high dose of aminoglycoside. For example, the salt of dibekacin and D glucaro 1,5 lactam is administered to a human adult at a dose of 50 to 200 mug potency as a free base of dibelacin daily.
