# Process for producing hydrocarbons containing alcohols.

## Abstract
CO hydrogenation process for producing alcohols is de scribed utilizing novel thallium promoted iron catalysts Fe T1 100 1 to 1 100 . Mixtures of CO H₂ 1 4 to 4 1 volumes are se lectively converted to liquid C₆ C₁₂ hydrocarbons containing C₆ C₁₂ alcohols with attendant low methane and low CO₂ make.
