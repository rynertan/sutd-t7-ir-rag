## Description
linprovements in and Relating to Moulding Machines This invention relates to the extrusion or injection moulding of dough moulding compositions.Such materials are stiff, pasty and difficult to feed to moulding apparatus because they do not flow, except under pressure. Hitherto, this problem has been overcome by means of a reservoir containing a supply of dough moulding compound and a piston which is applied to the dough moulding compound so as to progressively urge it into the moulding apparatus. However, as the supply runs out, it is necessary to stop the apparatus, withdraw the piston and replenish the reservoir. To avoid stopping the moulding apparatus, a second, duplicate reservoir can be employed, together with means for changing over to this second reservoir when the first one is empty.For example, the reservoirs may be mounted so they can be interchanged, or a valve may be used to switch the flow of moulding composition from one reservoir to the other.Such arrangements necessarily call for the use of two, relatively large reservoirs, complete with pistons and their operating mechanisms. It is an object of the invention to enable continuous operation of the moulding apparatus without the inconvenience of such a duplicate reservoir and piston assembly. DESCRI T r e ThE INN L f√¨i According to the present invention, means for feeding dough moulding composition to the barrel of an extruder or injection moulding machine comprises a reservoir, having means therein to urge moulding composition from said reservoir to the barrel of the extruder or injection moulding machine, a channel connecting said reservoir and barrel1 said channel having a variable volume portion and isolating valve means for closing the channel between the reservoir and said variable volume portion so that when said channel is open, moulding material flowing through the channel to the barrel will at least partly expand said portion so as to store moulding material therein, the arrangement being such that on closing said isolating valve means, and contracting said variable volume portion the flow of moulding composition to the barrel is maintained from said portion for at least as lcng as is necessary to replemish the reservoir.Preferably the variable volume portion is constituted by an ancillary piston and cylinder device.Preferably, the apparatus also includes means for operating the isolating valve means and the ancillary piston and cylinder device in timed relation substantially auto magically when the level in the reservoir has fallen to a rechosen extent. Advanageously, the ancillary piston and cylinder device and isolating valve means are located directly at the base cf the reservoir so that normal operation of the latte fills the cylinder by displacing the piston therein, subsequent return movement of the piston progressively displacing substantially the whole of the thus stored material from the cylinder before the isolating valve means is used to permit new material from the re filled resernoir to enter.By preventing the piston of the pistcm and cylinder device from being displaced by this new material for a brief period, the new material can be U t e it. ve means and associated of previo sAy stored material. This is important in .minimisir.g the risk of any material curing or becoming degraded by virtue of an excessively long dwell time in the apparatus. It is therefore helpful in maintaining homogeneity in the final product or products made by the extruder or injection moulding machine.The storage capacity of the ancillary piston and cylinder device in a typical case would be about 10 to 15 of that of the reservoir, so that a reservoir holding say a charge of 32kg. of material would have an ancillary piston and cylinder device capable of holding 4kg. of material.Naturally, the amount which it is necessary to store will also reflect the speed and ease with which the reservoir can be replenished, allowing for normal minor delays which may occur under production conditions.The rate of consumption by the extruder or injection moulding machine must also be considered in this context. EMBODIMENT OF THE IIRENTION In order thgt the invention be better understood a preferred embodiment of it will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing in which the sole Figure is a cross sectional view through apparatus for feeding dough moulding composition to an extruder, taken in a plane normal to the axis of the extruder barrel and including a hydraulic circuit and associated components.In the figure, an extruder barrel 1 contains a screw 2 both are conventional and will therefore not be described further. Mounted on the barrel in communication with a feed aperture 3 is the apparatus for feeding dough moulding composition to the extruder. The apparatus comprises a support block 4 carrying a feed hopper 5,The bottom of the hopper has a discharge outlet 6 the body of the whopper is essentially cylindrical and contains a piston 7, operated by a hydraulic actuator 13 . The outlet 6 communicates with the feed aperture 6 through a passageway 8 nlc.. rciudes an isolating valve 9 and an ancillary 1EtGII ad cylinder device, a cylinder 11 and a piston 12 operated by a hydraulic actuator 14.The latter is itself a piston and cylinder device operated by the hydraulic circuit, as will be discussed later.The passageway 8 opens into the cylinder 11 from the valve 9 so that when the piston 12 in the cylinder is at the limit of its travel to the right, in the figure , the end of the cylinder together with passageway 8 defines a flow path containing no dead spaces wherein material can lodge. The flow path is essentially selfpurging.The hydraulic circuit is depicted in conventional manner and includes flow reversal valves 15, 16 and 17, position sensing limit switches 18,19,20,21, and 22, a hydraulic actuator 23, a flow control valve 24, and pressure reducing valves 25 and 27. Hydraulic lines marked P are connected to a source of fluid under pressure, whilst lines markedT conmunicate with a fluid reservoir which is at, or near atmospheric pressure, for all practical purposes. Although not shown for reasons of simplicity, the pressure source and fluid reservoir are those associated with the moulding machine.The operation of the apparatus is as follows, starting with the hopper 5 full of dough moulding composition.To feed the barrel 1 the valve 9 must be opened by operating valve 17. This in turn operates the actuator 23 and opens the valve. Valve 15 is thereafter operated to urge the piston 7 downwardly inside the hopper under the control of the piston and cylinder device 13. This forces moulding composition through the passageway 8 into the piston and cylinder device 10 and into the feed aperture 6. Valve 16 is closed at this time so that no pressure is applied to the piston 12 by the actuator 13. However, fluid in the actuator is free to escape back into the reservoir at a rate ccrrlled by the valve 24, so that the flow of moulding material through passageway 8 causes the piston 12 to be displaced to the left in figure 2, thereby filling the cylinder 11 whilst at the same time feeding material to the screw 2 through aperture 3.The flow control valve 24 serves to regulate the rate at which material accumulates in the cylinder 11 so that the stored material is compacted.When the piston 7 has moved down to such an extent that the hopper is nearly empty, limit switch 22 is operated by a cam 26. This operates the valve 17 to close the isolating valve 9 it also operates valve 15 to halt the movement of the piston 7. Simultaneously, the valve 16 is operated to admit fluid to the piston and cylinder device 13 which therefore applies pressure to the piston 12 so as to force the stored moulding composition back into the passageway 8 and because the valve 9 is closed, into the feed aperture 6. The supply of moulding composition is thereby maintained until the hopper 5 has been replenished by withdrawing the piston 7 and introducing a fresh supply of moulding composition. The maximum length of time available for this will depend on the rate of consumption of the moulding machine, as well as on the capacity of the cylinder 11.In this context, the limit switches 18 and 19 should be mentioned. Limit switch 18 serves to indicate that the cylinder 11 has been filled a failure to do this could of course lead to an unwanted interruption of the supply to the machine.Limit switch 19 indicates that the contents of the cylinder 11 have been used up and that valve 9 should be opened, together with valve 15 to initiate the supply of material from the replenished hopper 5. In practice, of course, the limit switch 19 starts the whole operating sequence again, but by means of a timer associated with the machine control system, the valve 16 is not released immediately and pressure remains on the piston 12 until the new moulding material has purged the passageway 8 and the right hand end portion of the cylinder 11. The necessary delay is introduced automatically by the timer in the machine control system. It will be appreciated that valves 15 and 16 must be operated preferably automatically to stop the flow of material when the screw 2 is not rotating, because the resultant back pressure may result in extrusion of material around the margins of the pistons 7 and 12.It will also be appreciated that the apparatus can be used with a plunger type injection moulding machine to feed material to the plunger.In order to ensure a sensibly constant feed rate, the areas of the pistons 7 and 12 and the hydraulic pressures applied are preferably selected so that approximately the same pressure is always applied to the moulding composition being fed This is to avoid undue variation in the moulding process.
