# Solar collector comprising an absorber plate which exchanges heat with the evaporator section of a heat pipe.

## Abstract
A solar collector, comprising an absorber plate 7 which is arranged in thermally conductive relationship with the evaporator section 8 of a heat pipe 9 , the absorber plate 7 and the evaporator section 8 being surrounded by an evacuated transparent envelope 1 , the condenser section 10 of the heat pipe projecting from the envelope 1 to exchange heat with a medium to be heated, the evaporator section 8 of the heat pipe being enclosed by a tube 5 , one end of which is closed while its other end is connected to the end wall of the envelope 1 through which the heat pipe passes, the absorber plate 7 being connected to the tube and a suitable thermally conductive medium 11 being present between the tube 5 and the evaporator section 8 .
