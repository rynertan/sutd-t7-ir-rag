# Vacuum circuit interrupter.

## Abstract
The invention disclosed a vacuum type electric circuit interrupter comprising a highly evacuated envelope which includes at least one metallic tube 18,20,26,28 made of the magnetic material or the ferromagnetic material, a pair of relatively movable contacts disposed within said envelope in a location and means for eliminating the magnetodistortion of said metallic tube 18,20,26,28 . This means comprises a magnetic flux generating member 56 for supplying the magnetic flux to said metallic tube. The noise generated from the vacuum circuit interrupter is, accordingly, elimin ated by means of a magnetic field applying member for applying previously the magnetic field to said metallic tube or by increasing the magnetic reluctance of the metallic tube.
