## Description
Background of the Invention The sulfonylurea herbicides are an extremely potent class of herbicides discovered within the last few years. A multitude of structural variations exist within this class of herbicides, but they generally consist of a sulfonylurea bridge, SO2NKCONH , linking two aromatic or heteroaromatic rings. See, for example, the compounds disclosed in U.5. Patents 4 , l69, 19, U.S. 4,127,405, U.S. 4,120,691, U.S. 4,221,585, U.S.4,190,432, U.S. 4,225,337, U.S. 4,371,391, U.S.4,339,266, U.S. 4,191,553, U.S. 4,305,884, U.S .4,214,890, U.S. 4,339,267, U.S. 4,302,241, U.S. 4,342,587, U.S. 4,310,346, U.S. 4,293,330, U.S. 4,301,286, U.S. 4,370,479, U.S. 4,370,480, U.S.4,368,067, U.S. 4,369,320, U.S. 4,348,219, U.S.4,348,220, U.S. 4,333,760, U.S. 4,368,069, and U.S. 4,323,611 as well as in our EP 7,687. It is difficult to find herbicidal compounds which exhibit sufficient selectivity, that is, which will control weeds but which will not damage useful crop plants. Many of the sulfonylurea herbicides exhibit excellent selectivity on a number of crops while still controlling weeds at very low application rates. Nonetheless, even with such selective herbicides, it is often desired to provide even greater protection for crop plants than that provided by the herbicide alone. Antidotes have been found for other classes of herbicides which, when applied in combination with the herbicide, act to protect the useful crop plant from damage caused by the herbicide but which do not adversely affect the action of the herbicide on weeds.See, for example, U.S, Patent 3,564,768 which disclases that 1,8 naphthalic anhydride protects corn from damage caused by N,N dialkylthiocarbamate ester preemertent herbicides, or U.S. 4,070,389 which discloses a cyanomethoxyimino benzacetonitrile as a safener for herbicides such as the triazine and carbamate herbicides. U.S.Patent 4,343,649 discloses that these known antidotes, as well as the antidoteN,N diallyl 2,2 dichloroacetamide, are useful for protecting crops from injury caused by certain sulfonylurea herbicides, namely, 2 chl oro N 4 m ethoxy 6 methyl 1,3,5 triazin 2 yl aminocarbonylZbenzenesulfon amide, 2,5 dichloro N 4,6 dimethoxypyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl benzenesulfonamide and 2 N 4,6dimethylpyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoic acid, methyl ester. There is a continuing Seed for methods of antidoting the sulfonylurea herbicides and thereby increasing their usefulness to the agriculture industry. Summary of the Invention It has now been found that compounds of FormulasI and II can b used to protect crops from injury caused by sulfonylurea herbicides.EMI2.1 where R is C02CH3 or C02C2H5 R1 is H, C1 or CF3 is C1 C3 alkoxy or NR3R4 is H, OCH3, C1 C4 alkyl, cyclohexyl,C1 C4 alkyl substituted withEMI2.2 C1 C4 alkyl substituted with C1 C2 alkoxy or C1 C4 alkyl substituted with ethoxyethoxy R4 is H or C1 C2 alkyl R5 is H, C1 or OCH3 and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. This invention therefore relates to the method of using compounds of Formulas I and II to protect crop plants from injury due to herbicidal sulfonylureas. It also relates to herbicidal compositions comprising an herbicidally effective amount of one or more sulfonylurea herbicides and an antidotally effective amount of one or more compounds of Formula I orII. The compounds of Formula II are novel. Compounds of Formula I are novel where R R5 are defined as above, provided that when R is C02CH3 and R2 isC1 C3 alkoxy, then R1 is other than H. This invention therefore also relates to these novel compounds and their agriculturally suitable salts and to agricultural compositions containing them. Certain of the antidotal compounds of Formulas I and II are preferred for reasons of their great effectiveness and favorable ease of synthesis. These groups of compounds are those where 1 R1 is H. 2 R2 is OCH3 or NR3R4 3 R4 is H and, when R3 is C1 C4 alkyl substituted withEMI3.1 R5 is H. 4 R3 is H or C1 C4 alkyl optionally substituted with phenyl or with C1 C2 alkoxy. Specifically preferred for the same reasons are the following antidotal compounds 2 t aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoic acid, methyl ester, ammonium salt . 2 aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoic acid, methyl ester and . 3 aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl 2 thiophene carboxylic acid, methyl ester The antidotal compounds of Formulas I and II have been found to be especially effective in protecting crop plants from damage caused by sulfonylurea herbicides of Formula III EMI4.1 where R6 is C 2R8 or C1 R7 is H, C1 or CF3 R8 is C1 C3 alkyl X is CH3 or OCH3 Y is CH3, OCH3 or C1 and Z is CH or N provided that a when Y is C1, then Z is CH and Cb when R6 is C1, then R7 is H, X is CH3, Y is OCH3 and Z is N and their agriculturally suitable salts. Detailed DescriptionSynthesis Compounds of Formulas I and II are prepared as shown in Equation 1 by the reaction of an appropriately substituted o alkoxycarbonylbenzenesul fonyl isocyanate IV or 2 alkoxycarbonylthiophene 3 sulfonyl isocyanate V with an amine or alcohol whereinR, R1 and R2 are as previously defined.Equation 1EMI5.1 The reactions of Equations la and lb are best carried out under anhydrous conditions in an inert aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, chloroform, ethyl ether, acetonitrile or toluene. The sulfonyl isocyanate can be added neat or dissolved in the solvent and added to a solution of the appropriate amine or alcohol. A reverse addition of the reagents can be carried out where R2 is C1 C3 alkoxy or NR4R5 wherein R4 and R5 are not hydrogen.Although pressure and temperature are not critical, atmospheric pressure and temperatures of from 0 C to the boiling point of the solvent or ambient temperature are suitable for these reactions. In the pre sence of an excess of the amine HNR4R5 in Equation 1 the amine salt of the sulfonylurea is formed. This product can be dissolved in water or a lower alcohol and acidified with an acid such as hydrochloric acid or other strong mineral acid to yield the free acid form of the sulfonylurea. Alternatively, where R2 is C1 C3 alkoxy, these compounds can also be prepared as described in JapanPatent 57126 404. The corresponding benzenesulfonamide is dissolved in an alkaline aqueous solution and is reacted with the appropriate alkyl chloroformate e.g. methyl chloroformate, at low temperatures to yield the desired compounds. Where R2 isNR4R5 and R4 is other than H or methoxy and R5 is H, the ctompounds of this invention can also be prepared by the addition of an alkyl isocyanate to the appropriate sulfonamide as shown in Equation 2. Equation 2EMI6.1 This reaction can be carried out by mixing stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate sulfonamide, isocyanate and a base such as potassium carbonate in a polar solvent such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone at ambient to reflux temperature. The reaction mixture is poured into ice water and neutralized with hydrochloric or similar acid to precipitate the desired product. The sulfonylurea herbicides of Formula III are known, and their preparation is disclosed in U.S.Patent 4,127,405 and in EP A 7,687. Agriculturally suitable salts of the antidotes of Formulas I and II and of the herbicides of FormulaIII can be prepared by methods known in the art.Suitable salts include alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. potassium, sodium or calcium salts quaternary amine salts and acid addition salts, e.g. g toluenesulfonic acid or trichloroacetic acid addition salts. Following are examples illustrating the preparation of the antidotal compounds of this invention.All degrees are in Centigrade. Example 1Methyl 2 butylaminocerbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoate A mixture prepared from 20.13 g of methyl 2 aminosulfonyl benzoate, 12.0 g of n butyl isocyanate, 13.0 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate and 150 ml of acetone was stirred for two days at ambient temperature and pressure. It was then poured into 500 g of ice and water and neutralized to pH 7 by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid to yield a gummy precipitate. Extraction with methylene chloride 2 x 300 ml followed by drying of the organic phase over magnesium sulfate, filtering and evaporation of the solvent yielded a gummy residue. This product crystallized slowly on standing to yield 18.4 g of the desired compound, melting at 83 880, which was suitably pure for the purposes of this invention. Example 2Methyl 2 t aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyllenzoate ammonium salt To a solution prepared from 2 ml of liquified ammonia in 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran prepared under anhydrous conditions was added 1 g of methyl 2 isocyanatosulfonylbenzoate at 00. The resultant product was isolated by filtration and after washing with ethyl ether melted at 1180 with evolution of a gas.It showed absorption peaks by infrared analysis at 1720, 1650 and 1580 cm 1, consistent with the desired sulfonylurea product. Example 3Methyl 2 aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl benzoate Enough water was added to the ammonium salt, prepared as in Example 2, to dissolve the sample.This solution was acidified to pH 3 by the addition of 10 aqueous hydrochloric acid to precipitate the desired compound, melting at 165 1700. It showed absorption peaks by infrared absorption spectroscopy at 1760, 1690, 1550 and 1530 cm 1, consistent with the desired product. Example 4Methyl 3 aminocarbonyl aminosulfonyl thiophene carboxylate, ammonium salt To a solution containing 3 ml of liquified ammonia in 35 ml of tetrahydrofuran under anhydrous conditions was added 3.9 of methyl 3 isocyanatosulfonyl thiophene 2 carboxylate at 100. The precipitate thus formed was removed by filtration and air dried. It melted at 147 1490, with evolution of gas, and showed absorption peaks by infrared absorption spectroscopy at 3380, 3200 and 3180 cm l, con sistent with NH groups and 1680, 1650 and 1575 cm consistent with the desired sulfonylurea product. Example 5Methyl 3 aminosulfonyl aminocarbonyl 2 thiophene carboxylate The ammonium salt obtained in Example 4 0.9 grams was dissolved in 25 ml of water and the desired free acid form of the title compound was precipitated by the addition of 10 hydrochloric acid to pH 3. The product which was removed by filtration melted at 146 149 with decomposition and showed absorption peaks by infrared absorption spectroscopy, at 3480, 3360, 1740 and 1705 cm 1 , consistent with the desired product.

They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few litres to several thousand litres per hectare from a few pints to several hundred gallons per acre . High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 5 to 99 solid or liquid diluent s .More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Weight Percent Active Ingredient Diluent s Surfactant s Wettable Powders 20 90 0 74 1 10Oil Suspensions, 5 50 40 95 0 15Emulsions, Solutions, including EmulsifiableConcentrates Aqueous Suspension,Solution 10 50 40 84 1 20Dusts 1 25 70 99 0 5Granules and Pellets 1 95 5 99 0 15High Strength 90 99 0 10 0 2Compositions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al., Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents andCarriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described inMarsden, Solvents Guide, 2nd Ed., Interscience, NewYork, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at ODC. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MCPublishing Co., Glen Rock, New Jersey, as well asSisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents, Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foam, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. Preferably, ingredients should be approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the use intended. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example, Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J.

The product is reblended before packaging.Utility Test results indicate that compounds of FormulasI and II are useful in protecting crop plants from injury due to sulfonylurea herbicides by combining application of the herbicide to the locus of the plant with application of a non phytotoxic antidotally effective amount of one or more of the compounds of Formulas I or II to the crop seed, the crop plant or to the locus of the crop plant. Crop plants which can be protected from injury include cereal crops such as corn, wheat, sorghum and barley. Soybean crops can also be protected by means of this invention. A number of methods are available for combining application of the herbicidal and antidotal compounds described herein. The herbicide and antidote may be applied preemergence applied to the soil after planting, but before crop plants emerge , preplant soil incorporated applied to the soil and mixed into the soil before planting , or postemergence applied to the emerged crop and or weeds and on the exposed soil surface . Postemergence treatments may be directed so that the herbicide and or antidote is applied primarily to the weeds or crop. The antidotes and herbicides may be applied either simultaneously or sequentially. If applied sequentially, the antidote application usually precedes the herbicide application, although the reverse sequence can also be effective. In addition, the antidote may be applied directly to the crop seed.The seeds may be uniformly coated with the antidote according to standard seed treating procedures prior to planting. Alternatively, the antidote may be applied over the exposed seed in open furrow at planting, just prior to covering the seed with soil in the furrow treatment . The ratio of antidote to herbicide used will vary, depending upon the specific antidote and herbicide used and upon the method of application used.The crop species and cultural practices may also have an effect. For example, when the antidote is applied as a seed coating, it may be applied at a rate of about 0.1 to 0.5X of the seed weight. When the seeds are planted at from 10 to 150 kgSha, the antidote would be distributed at from 0.01 to 0.75 kg ha. In the preemergence, preplant soil incorporation and postemergence treatments, the antidote may be applied at about 0.1 to 10 kg ha. Similar rates may be used for in the row treatments however, since only the furrow is treated, the lower per hectare rate would be diminished to as low as about 0.01 kg ha, depending upon the row spacing. Since the herbicides may be used at rates of about 0.001 to 2 kg ha, the ratio of antidote to herbicide may vary between 1 200 to 10,000 1.One skilled in the art could determine the proper ratio to use in a given situation.

The pots were watered with tap water and fertilized with Peters 20 20 20 general purpose fertilizer once a week. The herbicide antidote treatments were made on the seedlings at the 1 3 leaf stages by a foliar spray. Application of the herbicide and antidote was made sequentially with single sprays of the herbicide or antidote formulation, the antidote formulation being sprayed first. Solutions of the herbicide and antidotes were made up separately in acetone water glycerine surfactant AGWT at a vol ume rate of about 560 aha. Evaluation of the antidote action was made 2 3 weeks after the postemergent spray. The degree of injury caused by the herbicide antidote applications and by the control applications herbicide alone was rated by visual evaluation and fresh weight measurement which was expressed as percent of untreated shoot fresh weight. Treatments with herbicide and solvent alone were also included in the tests. The results are given in Tables III to V. Many of the tests were repeated at different times of the year, accounting for the sometime divergent results. Although the growth stimulation i.e., weight greater than 100 of check observed in some of the tests may be due to the chemicals themselves, this effect may also be a result of lack of competition due to effective weed control.

A few drops of water were added and the jar was rotated until the seeds appeared evenly coated. After the seeds had been aerated thoroughly, they were planted in plastic pots or Fiber Paks in steam sterilized soil Metro Mix. Non coated seeds were similarly planted. Sulfonylurea herbicide treatments were sprayed in AGWT at a volume rate of 560 t ha on the soil surface as a typical preemergence treatment PRE . In the postemergence treatment POST , the sulfonylurea herbicides were applied as foliar sprays to the plants 9 days after treating and planting seeds.Immediately after planting and treating in all but the postemergence treatments, the test containers were watered with a fine mist to activate the chemical treatments and initiate crop germination. The tests were then held in the greenhouse under standard greenhouse care until evaluation after 14 21 days. Shoot fresh weight is recoraea and herbicide injury and or antidoting is computed as percent of check plant shoot fresh weight. The results are recorded in Tables VI and VII.
