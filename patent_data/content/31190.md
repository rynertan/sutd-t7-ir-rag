# Method of separating isotopes.

## Abstract
A method of separating isotopes of an element, for example uranium, comprises providing molecules of a com pound of the element having an isotopically shifted, but over lapping, infrared absorption spectrum associated with the isotopes of the element which does not change appreciably on absorption of photons. For uranium such molecules can be mixtures of ²³⁵UO₂ and ²³⁸UO₂ containing molecules of UO₂A₁A₂.L A₁ and A₂ being monovalent anions, for example CF₃COCHCOCF₃, and L a neutral ligand, for example trimethylphosphate. The molecules are irradiated at an infrared absorption frequency to isotopically selectively dis sociate said molecules to provide molecular fragments over a time interval, and collecting only those fragments which dis sociate within a predetermined portion of the time interval, for example between 0.1 and 10 microseconds after initiation of irradiation. Collection can comprise a second irradiation shifted by upto 100cm ¹ and of pulsewidth less than 5 mic roseconds.
