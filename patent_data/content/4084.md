# VAPOR LIQUID CONTACTING TRAY WITH VAPOR THRUST MEANS

## Abstract
A vapor liquid contacting tray is disclosed having an enclosure member overlying and extending transversely across the tray deck top surface from a portion above a tray support ring to an adjacent perforated portion of the tray deck wherein the perforation openings are unobstructed by the support ring. A vapor flow opening is located in the enclosure member over the portion of the tray deck above the support ring. Vapor flowing into the enclosure member from the overlaid tray deck perforation openings is directed through the vapor flow opening into the liquid on the tray deck surface portion overlying the support ring, to effect vapor liquid contacting and prevent liquid flow stagnation thereon.
