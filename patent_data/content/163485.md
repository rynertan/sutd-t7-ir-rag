# Single pivot bin sorter.

## Abstract
A sorting apparatus 20 has a nest of a plurality of sheet receiving bins B1 B5 supported on a sorting support frame 23 . Each bin has a sheet output end and a sheet input end. The bins are pivotally mounted at their output end about the same pivot point 25 on the support frame such that the output end of each bin is at a level higher than its input end so that the bins slope upwardly for uphill stacking of sheets as they are inserted. The bins are spaced relatively close together at the input end and relatively far apart at the output end. The apparatus is also provided with means 35 51 55 to sequentially pivot the bins about their pivoting mount to index the bins past a fixed feed throat for sheet insertion. As the bins are indexed past the fixed feed throat the indexing means widely spaced adjacent bins to facilitate sheet entry for successive bins when positioned opposite the feed throat while said input ends of said bins are nested close together on either side of the sheet entry.
