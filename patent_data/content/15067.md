## Abstract
A booster comprising a shell 1 and a second shell 2 sealingly and securely retained coaxially therein, by means of grommet 4, tongue 9 and crimps 10 and 11, the shell 2 having a closed end innermost within the cavity of shell 1 and shell 1 having one end closed by the shell 2 and the other closed by an end wall 12, and a body of granular explosive within shell 1 and surrounding at least the innermost part of shell 2. To be made ready for use, the booster is clamped in a cord connec tor with a detonation cord abutting end wall 12 and a further cord is inserted into the cavity 5 within shell 2 until the cord end abuts the wall 12, the cord being retained against retrac tion by prongs 8 of tube 7.
