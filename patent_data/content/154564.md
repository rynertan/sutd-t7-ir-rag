# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LAMINATING MULTILAYER PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS HAVING BOTH RIGID AND FLEXIBLE PORTIONS

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for laminating multilayer printed circuit boards having both rigid and flexible portions. The multilayers of a multilayer printed circuit board are positioned on a lower lamination plate which rests on a bleeder plate which itself rests on a vacuum plate. The circuit layers are then covered with another steel plate, a sheet of silicone material, a breather blanket and a plastic vacuum bag which is hermetically sealed to the vacuum plate using a silicone sealing material. The vacuum plate and the compo nents thereon are positioned within a pressure vessel, a vacuum line is connected to the vacuum plate and the multiple layers of the multilayer printed circuit board are laminated within the pressure vessel.
