# Method of forming a seal.

## Abstract
A method of forming a seal over at a discontinuity in a tubular area eg a joint 2 between two pipes 1 comprises providing a sealing sleeve 3 around the area and clamping the sleeve 3 in position with a clamping element 4 extending around the sealing sleeve 3 . The clamping element 4 has portions 8 with interengaging formations eg teeth 9 adapted to allow relative movement between said two portions 8 to apply clamping pressure to the sleeve 3 but to prevent relative movement in the other direction.
