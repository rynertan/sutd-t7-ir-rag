# An improved elevation setting mechanism for a table saw and the like.

## Abstract
Elevation setting mechanism for a motor driven tool in a power tool apparatus such as a table saw. The table saw described includes a housing 20 having a table top 26 with an opening through which the saw blade 43 can pass, and an assembly including a frame pivotally mounted in the housing 20 about a first axis. Pivotally mounted in the frame about a second pivot axis is a first subassembly which includes the saw blade 43 . Further, there is included a second subassembly pivotally mounted about the second pivot axis. The basic elevation setting mechanism includes a control lever 44 operatively connected to the second subassembly for pivoting same. The mechanism further includes a second control mechanism 52 operatively connected to the first subassembly for imparting additional pivotal movement thereto for effecting a vernier elevation adjustment of the saw blade 43 .
