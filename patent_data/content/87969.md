# Catalytic curing of coatings.

## Abstract
A method of curing a wet catalyst curable resin on a substrate in which the substrate is passed through a treating zone provided by a sealed vapor curing chamber connected to sealed entrance and exit ante chambers at respective ends. The ante chambers are each separated from the vapor curing chamber by a wall provided with a passage having height adjustable means to limit passage of gas. The substrate is passed in turn through the entrance chamber where the boundary layer of air is substantially replaced by inert gas, through the entrance chamber into the vapor curing chamber where it is exposed to the catalyst vapor, and then through the exit chamber where the curing vapor is removed. When a web provides the substrate, a jet of curing vapor is impinged on the web surface as it enters the vapor curing chamber at an angle and at a velocity effective substantially to remove the barrier layer of gas and permeate the coating. In starting up, the entrance and exit chambers and vapor curing chamber are purged with inert gas thereby to remove air and on termination of the curing operations the vapor curing chamber is purged with inert gas to remove curing vapor. Apparatus is disclosed for carrying out the method, featuring height adjustable doors between the vapor curing chamber and the entrance and exit chambers. Other features are labyrinth seals and turning vanes adjacent to the passage from one chamber to the other to minimize escape of gas.
