## Description
AUTOMATIC RADAR EMISSION EXTRACTORThe invention herein refers to an automatic radar emission extractor.In particular, it refers to the structural realization of an automatic radar emission extractor connected to an interceptor which is able to convert the impulse parameters of received radar emissions to digital form.Such parameters at the carrying frequency, the direction oi origin, the dur tion of impulse and the amplitude.For automatic radar emission extractor is intended a system which accepts data in codified Ã²rm rclative to cach impulse of all the radar emissions present in the electromagnetic environment as input, re ar ranges them according. to the different types of emission, extracts from them the characteristics parameters and presents them in concise forrr, on an appropriate display.In the existing tcchniques, such a function comes about by resorting to the following procedure for a certain number of emissions, known apriori, a certain number of Jigital filters are predisposed for the afore seid parameters cxcludis g the amplitude and the direction of origin as much as the emission is not identified , together with a time sequence of apertures in time, with the aim of considcring in the filter the period o repetition of the emission itself. In such a way it is possible to over cona ,he sequence of interlaced impulses, knowtl apriori, from the other received impulses.For the emissions riot known apriori, means are 1 ukell to trisualize eadi parameter on separate screens or else on bi dimens onal screcns gener ally anglc frequcncy or else duration of impulse angle . At this point an operator is able to pres ose an appropriate filter template in the aimensions of the screen coordinates, that isolates the desired sequence from the others and therefore allows for the measurement of the repetition period and the other characteristics at longer time intervals from the emission itself cadence of rctation at the antenna and type of scanning and also time tracking of the isolated emission.The disadvantages oI this system of extraction are that the atmosphere emissions are still noteworthy. In more, there is need for a full time operator who would otherwise concentrate on more important tasks such as tactical evaluations and countermeasures, also the use of an operator can only assure slow reaction to the variation of the electromagnetic environment and greatly increase the possibility of loosing short term emissions that are not known apriori. In order to overcome this inconvenience it is necessary that the function of filter of the emissions not knout apriori be made automatically and in a way that the reaction times be adequate.To obtain this result, a possible structure to realize is one that memorizes for a certain time the impulses received, it examines them and it associates them and then it refers itself to a successive group of impulses. This can be realized by means of two types of structure one that works on a full memory calculates when the memory is full and one that works at the completion of time, elaborates, after a certain time has elapsed, on that which is gathered in the memory The present invention refers to an extractor that works according to the second type of structure.A des criptin of the above mentioned can be obtained by referring to figure I which demonstrates, in block form, the structure object of the invention. The makcup of time extractor is as follows the impulses of the emitting radar, received in real time and converted into digital form. in its impulse parameters angle, fequency, duration ofimpulse and amplitude from the ecciver, are gathered by a group cf digital filters block 1 in figure l whose filtering templates are automatically adapted to the existing electromagnetic surroundings in a rather short time inier val which will be called dt. The functioning principal of this template is the following.At the beginning of the time interval dl, the first impulse reccived, pertaining to a Radar l characterized by a phase Fl, and angle G1, and an impulse duration PWI determines the establishment, in the firsi filter which makes up part of the above mentioned group of a seauence of acceptance parameters cqual to F1, G19 PW1, in which the acceptance interval 15 given by F1 AF, G1 4 AG, PW l PW1 in which T, A C and PW depend upon the characteristics of the means ef measurement and those o the electromagnetic environment.The amplitude A of the reception impulse does not establish an acceptance window because this magnitude can be a variable parameter at very short time intcrvals for example in relation to the antenna lobe size . Aiter the adjustment of the first filter it comes about that a successive impulse from the Radar 1 sequence will be accepted by the afore mention ed filter as much as it i characterized by the same parameters F1, G1, PW1 and can nevertheless still be memorized together with its arrival time such as to furnish information and a basic of calculation to determi ne the value and the structure of the repetition rythm of the impulse. An impulse originating from a Radar 2 is rejected by the first filter and will determine the adaptation of a second template characterized by an acceptance interval F2 F, G b C, PW2 b PW according to the nanner described above This functioning mecnanism is called filter adaptation in time dt to the electromagnutic environment. This continues in scquC.e with the third, fourth ctc. filters, dctermining the nda stations of new filter whenever an arriving impulse is rejected by all the pr cee ding filters.This operating sequence continues until the time interval dt expires.During this timc interval a certain number n of radar sequences can be accepted, t .at gene1aliy is less than the maximum number of existing radar sequences in the atmosphere.Therefore, a characteristic of the filter group is that the number of filters is not proportional to the foreseen total number of emissions present, but to the use of tiic receiver by the emissions that arc foreseen to be received during the above time interval dt.The time interval dt is chosen proportionally to the ioreseen maximum receiving time of illumination of a scanning radar. The filters remain adjusted to the external environment for the same time interval dt aiter which they loose the memorized received adaptation and are made availa ble to be newly adapted to the existing electromagnetic environmcnt in the succesi ve time interval dt.In this way, during each time interval the parameters of the impulses relative to the emissions that are present in the interval itself are picked up.If the number of filters is well proportioned in relation to tb maximum traffic foreseen, the probability that an Emission not be picked up by the filters that adapt themselves to the electromagnetic environment is small. Moreover, the impulses picked up by each filter are limited to a maximum number the exceeding ones are discarded .Besides this, to each of these impulses is associated its respective time of arrival and it is then reserved in . memory bank foreseen for each filter.On the expiration of the time interval dt the Contents of the memory bank of each filter is passed to one or more means of programmable calculation that have the tasl of determining how many and which emissions were present in the said time interval and to calculate the non impulsive parameters and in the shortest time of the picked up emissions cadence oi impulse time repetition and time of cadence The means of calculation that work in pipe line will the group of fieis, carry out this opcration in thc time intcrval dt successive to the pick ul interval by tlie filte rs . With this device, therefore, an automatic extraction in time dt is rcalizcd.in the time intcrval dt , successive to dt , the same operation is performed by the group of filters on the radar sequenccs that arc received in the said interval.In general. the radars present in the time interval dt will be the S me wl.ic , already present in the interval dt2 p US others that insurge in the interval dt, whe re other radars present in dtl shall have ceased to exist or thc receiver has not been capable of receiving an adequate number of impulses to make possible the extraction operation in the time dt .Finally, the two extracted environnients an the times dtl and dt2 will generally have some radars in common, while some will only be present in dtl cr only in dt2. After a sufficiently large number of dt1 intervals, all the radars present in the electromagnetic environment will have had a predetermined probability to have been received and memorized in at least one of the dt intervals.Therefore, having availablc in short time intervals proceeding the extractor,one or more means of calculation, it is possible to say after an adequate time t dt in what timc interval dtl the emission of each radar has been received, with what characteristics, and with what amplitude.This permits the automatic extraction of the environment, characterizing in such a way the behaviour of the emitter in the time t and therefore permitting the exams nation of the parameters in longer timc intervals antenna rotation cadence and tL pe of cadence .It is worthwhile to note that the succeeding integration operations come about onc after the other always In the successive time intervals dt.For example, in the time dt3 are integrated dtl dt2 in dt4 is integratcd dt3 the integration of dtl dt2 and so on.The quoted time bt dt is not an extractor parameter but only indicates a time interval sufficiently long, starting from the instant of light up, in order to allow the extractor to have arrived at a steady state condition.The results of the integration are transfErred to the introducing means in human time and therefore not every dt . As we have sccn how ver, the automatic extraction is therefore realized by silts grating the extracted environments in the times dt by nicans of one or more sucCe sive means of programmable calculation that execute the operations as in a film in which the framcs are the extracted environment in the times dt. These last means of calculation have therefore the task of establishing how many emissions are present ii. the atmosphere and to calculate the long time parameters antenna sweep and time of sweep . If the integration operation is realized with a single means of calculation, the afore mentioned is generally also capable of handling the interface with the means of introduction. If instead, such an operation comes about with more parallei cal culting means, another means cf programmable calcultion will be necessary to pick up the data from the parallel calculating means, make up the total environ ment and handle the interface with tie introducing means. Therefore, the object of the invention hercin is an automatic radar emission extractor connected to an interceptor capable of converting the impulse parame ters of the received radar emission, charac.erized by the fact that they are m e up of a group of autoadaptive filters with respect to the said parameters, into digital form a memory bank associated to each filter cf the group in which are reserved the impulses accepted by the filter together with their respective arri val times one or more means of programmable calculation that execute the auto matic extraction in a time dt one or more second means of programmable calculation that execute the automa tic extraction at long time intervals by integrating the extracted environment in said time dt in the case in which the said first and or second means of programmable calcula tion are multiple, an ulterior means f programmable calculation for the calcula tion of data from the parallel environment extractors and for the interface reali zation with the mcans of iniroduction. The present invention has been described in one of its realized forms but it can be modified and substitutions made without, because of thins, leaving the limits of protection of the following industrial patent right.
