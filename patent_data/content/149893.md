# Apparatus for coding and decoding data.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for coding signals representing a stream of digital data groups for example run lengths for transmission or storage, each group representing a numeric al quantity, is described. The signals are supplied via input and modify registers 4,6 and an encode latch 11 to a set of encode PROMs 12 . The PROMs 12 generate for each data group a code representing the group, the code comprising a terminator codeword and, where necessary, one or more make up codewords. The codewords are based on one or more multiplicative modifiers. The codewords are fed in parallel to output registers 13,14 and then serially shifted out of the output registers for subsequent transmission, a storage, or further processing.
