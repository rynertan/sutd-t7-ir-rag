## Description
This invention relates to circuit breakers capable of breaking associated circuit upon a short circuit or when an overcurrent higher than a rated current keeps flowing and, more specifically, to a circuit breaker improved remarkably in the current limiting effect so as to be able to reliably protect any circuit specifically including such elements not withstandable to short circuit current as semiconductors. A circuit breaker of the kind referred to, as has been disclosed in, for example, US A 3,329,913, comprises a fixed contact carrier carrying a fixed contact, a movable contact carrier carrying a movable contact contactable with the fixed contact a manual contact opening and closing mechanism normally operable to separate the movalbe contacts from the fixed contacts and including a trip means which forcibly separates the movable contacts from the fixed contacts, an electromagnetic device operating in response to the short circuit current as well as the overcurrent to attract an armature linked to the trip means, and an arc suppressing means disposed adjacent contacting and separating position of the fixed and movable contacts. Thus the contacts are normally closed and opened by means of the manual contact opening and closing mechanism which moves the movable contacts with respect to the fixed contacts whereas, upon the short circuit or when the overcurrent higher than the rated current keeps flowing, they are opened by means of the trip means which separates the movable contacts from the fixed contacts with an actuation of the electromagnetic device and attraction of the armature. An arc generated upon such contact opening is shifted towards the arc suppressing means to be therein divided, cooled and suppressed. In the known circuit breaker, however, a relatively long time has been required until a complete arc suppression is achieved after the separation of the movable contacts from the fixed contacts by the trip means specifically upon the actuation of the electromagnetic device due to the short circuit current which causes the armature to be attracted. The arc suppressing means is merely disposed adjacent the contacting and separating position of the contacts, rendering the time relatively long required for driving and drawing the arc towards the arc suppressing means by a magnetic driving force and consequently until the complete arc suppression is reached. In an event where the circuit of which breaking is to be made includes such elements low in the withstand voltage as semiconductor elements, they are damaged by a high voltage applied thereto upon the short circuit. Still more important, it has been desired for the circuit breaker of the kind referred to that the movable contacts are rapidly separated from the fixed contacts specifically at the time of the actuation of the electromagnetic device responsive to the short circuit current, and that the arc suppression is achieved in an extremely short time, so that the current limiting effect can be remarkably improved and a smooth application to the circuit involving the elements of low withstand voltage can be achieved. It is also known another circuit breaker, as disclosed in GB A 2061619, which comprises A primary object of the present invention is to obtain a circuit breaker which shortens the required time from the separating motion of the movable contact carrier from the fixed contact carrier upon the actuation of the electromagnetic device having detected a current higher than a predetermined rated value, thus improving the current limiting effect remarkably. According to the present invention, the movable contactor is caused to be propelled so as to promote its opening motion immediately after a release from a latch member upon the trip operation, whereby the instantaneous responsibility is made excellent and thus the current limiting effect is elevated. According to the present invention FIG. 1 is a plan view of a circuit breaker according to the present invention, FIG. 2 is a side elevation of the breaker of FIG. 1 with one of two dividable halves of its casing removed, FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the disassembled circuit breaker with the casing removed, FIG. 4 is a sectional view as taken along line IV IV in FIG. 1, FIG. 5 is a sectional view showing main parts only of FIG. 4 in contact closed state, FIG. 6 is a sectional view similar to FIG. 5 in a state where the electromagnetic device of the circuit breaker is completely actuated due to overcurrent, FIG. 7 is an endwise elevation of the circuit breaker, FIG. 8 is a sectional view taken along line VIII VIII in FIG. 2, and FIG. 9 is a sectional view taken along line IX IX in FIG. 2. Referring to the drawings, a circuit breaker 10 is provided with an electromagnetic device 11, a manual contact opening and closing mechanism 12 including a trip mechanism operably coupled to the electromagnetic device 11 and being shiftable into a tripped state when an overcurrent flows, a contact section 13 including a movable contact carrier 14 with a movable contact 16 and a fixed contact carrier 15 with a fixed contact 17. The contacts can be opened or closed by operating the manual contact opening and closing mechanism 12. An arc suppressing means 18 is provided for allowing at least a part of the movable contact carrier 14 where the movable contact 16 is held to pass therethrough when the movable contact carrier 14 performs its contact opening motion. In the electromagnetic device 11, a rectangular yoke 20 of a magnetic material is provided, and a cylinder 22 on which a coil 21 for detecting the overcurrent is wound is secured to the yoke 20. In the cylinder 22, a magnetic head 23 is secured substantially in the center, and a first plunger 24, to which loads of a viscous fluid and of a spring are applied, and a second plunger 25 are disposed to oppose each other with the magnetic head 23 interposed between them. In this case, any overcurrent flowing through the coil 21 causes initially the first plunger 24 to be attracted to the magnetic head 23 while being subjected to a retarding action due to the viscousity of the fluid and the spring load and then the second plunger 25 is also attracted to the head 23 with an increased magnetic force. When, on the other hand, a short circuit current flows through the coil 21, the second plunger 25 is caused to be attracted to the magnetic head 23 immediately without waiting for the attraction of the first plunger 24 to the head 23. One of lead out ends of the coil 21 is projected out of the yoke and connected to a lead wire 26 having a sufficient flexibility, and the other lead out end is extended downward from the yoke 20 and secured to a terminal 27 of the breaker. For details of the foregoing electromagnetic device see GB A 2117 973 published after the priority date of the present patent. At the upper end portion of a side part of the yoke 20, there is provided a frame 28 for supporting the manual contact opening and closing mechanism including the trip mechanism so as to be integral and to project substantially in extended direction of the upper beam part of the yoke 20. The frame 28 comprises vertically and mutually parallelly extended short and long frame parts 29 and 30. In the short frame part 29, there are provided shaft bearing holes 32 and 33 respectively made in the foremost end extension 31 and rearward upper corner, as well as a further shaft bearing hole 34 made in the rearward portion below the hole 33. The long frame part 30 is provided, on the other hand, with a shaft bearing hole 36 made in an expanded part 35 provided at a position corresponding to the extension 31 of the short frame part 29, and with shaft bearing holes 37 and 38 respectively in the rearward portion at its corresponding positions to the holes 33 and 34 in the short frame part 29. In the long frame part 30, further, a reverse L shaped sliding aperture 39 is formed to have at a part an arcuate edge 40, while the tip end part is bent substantially perpendicularly. Such bent part 41 is provided at the upper edge with an engaging part 42 and at the lower edge with a horizontal arc running extension 43 of a small disk shape. In the manual contact opening and closing mechanism 12, a handle 44 has a shaft bearing hole 46 made in the center of a lower cylindrical part 45 which is provided at a part of its periphery with an expanded part 48 having a through hole 47. The handle 44 is rotatably supported by the frame 28 with a supporting shaft 49 passed through the hole 46 and born at the shaft bearing holes 32 and 36 of the short and long framing parts 29 and 30. In the through hole 47, one leg 51 of a U shaped link pin 50 is inserted, and the free end of this leg 51 is freely engaged in the L shaped sliding aperture 39 of the long framing part 30 to be shiftable along the arcuate edge 40. The other leg 52 of the link pin 50 is passed through respective shaft bearing holes 57 and 58 of projections 55 and 56 provided to oppose each other on a link arm 54 while its free end is engaged freely in the sliding aperture 39 so as to be slidable in the other vertical part thereof. The link arm 54 itself is provided with a base part 59 of a reverse U shape as seen endwise, and an engaging opening 60 is made in the base part 59. From forwarding end of the base part 59, mutually parallelly and vertically downwardly extended arms 61 and 62 on which the projections 55 and 56 are provided extend as formed integrally with the base part, and shaft bearing holes 63 and 64 are provided in respective tip ends of the arms 61 and 62. Further, one of the arms has a kicking tongue 65 projected from the lower edge as bent into an L shape and slightly slanted upward with respect to the vertical direction, and also a stopping projection 66 projected from the upper edge as bent also into an L shape to be substantially horizontal. A support shaft 67 is born in the shaft bearing holes 63 and 64 at the tip ends of the arms 61 and 62, as passed through a shaft bearing hole 68 of the movable contact carrier 14 of an angled shape and connected through the lead wire 26 to one end of the detecting coil 21, whereby the movable contact carrier 14 is pivoted to the link arm 54. At a position above the shaft bearing hole 68 of the movable contact carrier 14, an expanded part 70 having an engaging hole 69 is provided to project upward, while the movable contact 16 made preferably of a material of a high conductivity is secured to the tip end at its lower edge. The above described movable contact 16 of the movable contact carrier 14 is disposed to be contactable with the fixed contact 17 made preferably of a highly conductive material and secured to the fixed contact carrier 15 disposed below the movable contact carrier 14. The fixed contact carrier 15 per se is slanted at one leg part of a U shaped portion 71 to which the fixed contact 17 is secured, to be inclined downward toward the arc suppressing means 18 so as to provide an arc running part 72 extending further downward to a position opposing the arc running extension 43 of the frame 28, while a connecting part 74 made integral with a terminal 73 extends from the other leg part of the U shaped portion 71 and is bent into an L shape. There is provided an arrangement for accelerating the contact opening speed of the movable contact carrier 14. An interlocking arm 76 of the trip mechanism is pivoted to a support shaft 75 born in the shaft bearing holes 33 and 37 of the frame 28. This interlocking arm includes a base part 78 having a notch 77 for engaging the head part of the second plunger 25 of the electromagnetic device 11, a pair of arms 79 and 80 are extended from the forward end of the base part 78 vertically and mutually parallelly, the support shaft 75 is born in shaft bearing holes 81 and 82 made in the respective arms 79 and 80, and the interlocking arm 76 is pivoted to the frame 28 as referred to above. One arm 79 extends downward bent to be L shape, and a kicking foot 83 projects to be capable to hit the kicking tongue 65 of the link arm 54 to propel the same. To the support shaft 75, further, a latch member 84 of an L shape as seen sideward and operating integrally with the interlocking arm 76 is pivoted through shaft bearing holes 85 and 86, one extension of this latch member 84 is formed to be an arm 87 which is normally separated slightly from the lower surface of the base part 78 of the interlocking arm 76 but is engageable thereto upon its actuation, and the other extension extends downward with a leg 89 having a hook 88 to project into the engaging opening 60 of the link arm 54 and engages to an edge of the same. A coil spring 90 is mounted about the support shaft 49 of the handle 44, and always provides to the handle 44 a rotating force acting in the direction of the contact opening motion, that is, in the clockwise direction in FIG. 2, being engaged at one end to an angled corner edge of the sliding aperture 39 and at the other end to the leg 51 of the link pin 50 while being guided by a semi annular guide 53 on the lower part 45 of the handle 44. To the tip end engaging part 42 of the long frame part 30 in the frame 28, further, one end of a return spring 91 is engaged while the other end thereof is engaged in the hole 69 of the movable contact carrier 14, so that the contact carrier 14 will always receive a force acting in the direction of separating from the fixed contact carrier 15. Further, an interlocking arm spring 92 and latch spring 93 are mounted about the support shaft 75 of the interlocking arm 76, and the interlocking arm spring 92 is engaged at one end to the lower surface of the base part 78 of the interlocking arm 76 and at the other end to a shaft 94 held in the holes 34 and 38 of the frame 28 so as to always urge the interlocking arm 76 in the counterclockwise direction in FIG. 2, that is, in the direction of pulling the second plunger 25 upward. The latch spring 93 is engaged at one end to the shaft 94 and at the other end to a proper portion of the frame 28 as, for example, to circumferential edge of a round hole 95 made in the long frame part 30 so as to be effective to urge the latch member 84 always in the counterclockwise direction, that is, to be engageable to the link arm 54. Between the arc running extension 43 of the frame 28 and the arc running part 72 of the fixed contact carrier 15, the arc suppressing means 18 is disposed. This arc suppressing means 18 is provided with a recess 96 through which the tip end of the movable contact carrier 14 is allowed to pass, and comprises a plurality of deion grids 97 of a U shape as seen flatly and mutually separated with a small clearance. These deion grids 97 are held between both side plates 98 and 99 and provided at their end edges with an end plate 100 fixed to the side plates 98 and 99. Arc gas discharging opening 101 is made in the end plate 100 while, in the center of the opening 101, a direct discharge restricting plate part 102 is provided to oppose the recess 96 of the deion grids 97. A casing 103 for housing therein all of the foregoing constituent members is provided for defining a housing space with mutual engagement of two divided casing halves 104 and 105, which are respectively provided with a notch for forming a rectangular slit 106 in an end wall on the side where the arc suppressing means 18 is disposed when engaged to each other. The slit 106 is positioned behind the direct discharge restricting plate part 102. The casing 103 further defines in its upper surface part a handle hole 107 through which the handle 44 projects and which restricts its rotation within a predetermined angle of rotation, while allowing the lower part 45 of the handle 44 to be rotatably seated immediately below the hole 107. Inside the casing 103, a projection suitable for restricting the rotating stroke of the link arm 54 when being engaged to the stopping projection 66 of the arm 54 is provided, and a square shaped pillar 108 to which the U shaped part 71 of the fixed contact carrier 15 can be fitted and, preferably, a projecting wall for insulating the contact carrier from environment of the lead wire 26 on the side opposite to the pillar are provided. Further inside the casing 103, bed parts 109 and 110 are provided for compactly and stably seating thereon the electromagnetic device 11 and arc suppressing means 18. An elastic member such as a spring may be attached to the above restricting projection so as to cause the link arm 54 to be repelled back, whereby the link arm 54 is made to rotate in the counterclockwise direction after a rapid rotation in the clockwise direction. The operation of the circuit breaker shall be further referred to. When the handle 44 of the manual contact opening and closing mechanism is in the position of FIG. 2 or 4, that is, rotated clockwise in the drawing, leg 51 of the link pin 50 is positioned at the uppermost end of the arcuate edge 40 of the sliding aperture 39 while the other leg 52 is located at the upper part in the other vertical part of the aperture 39 and, with the biasing force of the return spring 91 applied additionally, the link arm 54 and movable contact carrier 14 are moved upward. When the handle 44 is rotated from the position of FIG. 2 or 4 to that of FIG. 5, resisting thus against the biasing forces of the coil spring 90 mounted on the support shaft 49 for the handle and of the return spring 91, the handle 44 is stopped at its position rotated counterclockwise overcoming the biasing forces of the springs 90 and 91 when the position of leg 51 of the link pin 50 inserted in the through hole 47 of the expanded part 48 at the lower part 45 of the handle has exceeded a line connecting the handle support shaft 49 and leg 52 of the link pin 50, and the handle is retained there. Thereby leg 51 of the link pin 50 is made to reach the lower part of the arcuate edge in the sliding aperture 39 and the other leg 52 to reach the lower part of the vertical part in the aperture 39, thus the link pin 50 is made to be substantially in vertical state in which the hook 88 of the latch member 84 is engaged edgewise to the engaging opening 60 of the link arm 54, the link arm 54 as well as the movable contact carrier 14 which is coupled through the support shaft 67 to the arm 54 are both rotated to be slanted forward until the contact closing state is reached. In this case, an electric circuit is formed by means of the terminal 27, coil 21, lead wire 26, movable contact carrier 14, movable contact 16, fixed contact 17, fixed contact carrier 15 and terminal 73. When an overcurrent as, for example, a current 1.15 times as large as the rated current keeps flowing in the contact closing state of FIG. 5, the magnetic head 23 is excited through the coil 21 in the electromagnetic device 11, and the first plunger 24 is attracted gradually to the magnetic head 23. The permeability of the magnetic circuit through the yoke 20 is thereby increased and the second plunger 25, normally disposed in its upper position through the interlocking arm 76 due to the spring load of the interlocking arm spring 92, is attracted to the magnetic head 23 against this spring load. Accompanying this, the interlocking arm 76 and latch member 84 are rotated with the support shaft 75 as the center, the hook 88 of the latch member 84 is disengaged from the edge of the engaging aperture 60 of the link arm 54 and, as shown in FIG. 6, the kicking tongue 65 of the link arm 54 is hit by the kicking foot 83 of the interlocking arm 76 to be moved upward. The link arm 54 is, therefore, subjected to a sort of firm starting force due to such hitting and propelling motion, the rotary force of the link arm 54 is rapidly increased, and the movable contact carrier 14 is rapidly separated from the fixed contact carrier 15 to reach the position of FIG. 6 under the assistance of the return spring 91 engaged to the movable contact carrier 14 coupled to the link arm 54. Since, at this time, the electromagnetic driving force produced by the current flowing through the fixed and movable contact carriers 15 and 14 acts on the arc generated upon the contact opening and, the movable contact 16 positioned outside the arc suppressing means during the contact closed state is caused to pass immediately through the recess 96 of the arc suppressing means 18, the arc is divided, cooled and extremely effectively suppressed within this arc suppressing means. As the fixed contact carrier 15 is slanted at the portion adjacent the fixed contact 17 to be positioned very close to the arc suppressing means 18 as has been described, the arc is made to effectively shift to the arc suppressing means 18 even before it reaches the arc running part 72 so that the arc suppressing efficiency is also elevated by this arrangement. When the movable contact carrier 14 has moved upward, the upper part of its tip end is positioned very close to the frame 28 so that there can be formed an electric path through the frame 28 having the arc running extension 43 and the yoke 20 integral with the frame 28 after the contact opening. In addition, while an arc gas generated upon the arc suppression can be discharged from the discharging opening 101 formed in the end plate 100 of the arc suppressing means 18 through the slit 106 of the casing 103 to the exterior, the provision of the direct discharge restricting plate 102 in the discharge opening 101 as aligned in the longitudinal direction of the casing 103 with the slit 106 causes the arc gas to go around the restricting plate 102 without being directly discharged to the exterior, whereby the gas discharge can be made relatively gradual and any rapid arc gas discharge can be prevented. The rapid arc gas discharge is not desirable since the divided arcs inside the arc suppressing means 18 are caused to be mutually short circuited through the arc gas in the exterior of the suppressing means again and the arc suppressing efficiency is deteriorated. The slight separation at one arm of the latch member 84 from the lower surface at the base portion of the interlocking arm 76 renders the second plunger 25 of the electromagnetic device 11 not to be subjected to any load incurred by the weight of the latch member 84 as well as its associated members but rather to be actuatable at a predetermined current level upon, for example, the short circuit. Further, when a short circuit current, that is, a current which is two or three times as large as the rated current flows, the second plunger 25 is immediately attracted to the magnetic head 23 since the exciting force of the coil 21 is extremely large, and the interlocking arm 76 and latch member 84 are caused to be instantaneously actuated. Except for this respect, the same operation as that performed when the overcurrent flows as has been disclosed is also performed upon the short circuit, and the same function can be obtained. In the described circuit breaker the movable contact carrying part of the movable contact carrier always passes through the interior of the arc suppressing means upon the opening operation of the contacts, and thus the arc dividing, cooling and suppressing are remarkable. When the circuit breaker is tripped, the link arm 54 supporting the movable contact carrier is hit and propelled, whereby the contact opening operation can be performed extremely quickly. Generally, the current limiting effect of the breaker can be improved and a large current flow in the circuit can be effectively prevented, so that elements sensitive to overcurrents, as semiconductors, included in the circuit can be sufficiently protected.
