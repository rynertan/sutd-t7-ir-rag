# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING CHARACTERISTICS OF LIQUIDS

## Abstract
The pour point of an oil, for example, is detected by reciprocating an actuator which first allows a member to sink under its own weight into the liquid, and then lifts the member back to its original position. The temperature at which the member fails to sink by a predetermined distance within a predetermined time period is noted. The member is made of heat insulating plastics material. Means are pro vided to produce an audible, visual and or electrical signal when the member has shifted downwardly by the predeter mined distance.
