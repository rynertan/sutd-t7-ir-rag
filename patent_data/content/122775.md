# Method for making a cathode, and method for lowering hydrogen overvoltage in a chloralkali cell.

## Abstract
The invention provides an improved process for making an iron activated cathode for a chloralkali cell, and an improved method for lowering the operating voltage of a chloralkali electrolysis cell, which comprises adding to the cathode compartment of the cell a solution of a water soluble or caustic soluble ferrite and passing an electric current through the cell. By virtue of the invention, the hydrogen overvoltage in the cell is lowered, and considerable operating improvement thereby attained.
