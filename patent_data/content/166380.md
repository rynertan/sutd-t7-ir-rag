# FREQUENCY SELECTIVE FILTER CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A time domain filter having ideal high pass and low pass characteristics is provided by means of a one shot monostable multivibrator and a flip flop interconnected by means of an AND gate and an EXCLUSIVE OR gate wherein the set time for the one shot is equal to the half period of the cut off frequency. The time domain bandpass filter circuit having ideal bandpass filter characteristics comprises a pair of one shot monostable multivibrators connected in cascade with each other and interconnected with a flip flop by means of an AND gate. A further application of a modi fied time domain filter is that of time domain FM demodula tor having an optional phase locked loop.
