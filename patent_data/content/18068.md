# Adjustable vapour deposition apparatus.

## Abstract
A vapor deposition system for forming an optical waveguide blank, comprises vapor deposition means 12 for receiving source material vapor and directing the vapor or reaction products thereof toward a starting member 10 . Enclosed reservoirs 18, 20, 22 contain liquids comprising source materials. Each reservoir has a heater 24,26,28 for heating the liquid therein to a temperature sufficient to maintain a predetermined minimum vapor pressure within each reservoir. Control valves 42,44,46 are coupled to each of the reservoirs to control the flow of vapors of the liquid in the reservoirs at a controlled flow rate to the vapor deposition means. The vapors may be delivered through a conduit 71 into which oxygen may be introduced.
