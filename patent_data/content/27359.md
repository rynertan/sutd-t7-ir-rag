# Method of removing oil from water, and bag and two or more linked bags of feathers for use therein.

## Abstract
Previously proposals of employing feathers to remove oil from water have not proved successful because of difficulties in effectively exposing all the feathers to the oil. The problems are now overcome by distributing bags 10 loosely contain ing feathers 13 onto oil on water to enable the feathers to take up the oil. The bags 10 have openings sufficiently large to permit the oil to enter and contact the feathers, yet suffi ciently small to retain the feathers within the bags. The bags 10 can be linked together, for example in a chain using ropes 11 . Once the feathers have become saturated with oil the bags 10 can be picked up from the water.
