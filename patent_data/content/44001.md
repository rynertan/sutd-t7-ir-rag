# Multiple station packaging machine and method for packaging.

## Abstract
A packaging machine 50 and method for automatically packaging articles F such as fruit one layer at a time into containers 68 is provided. Means 61 are provided for disposing the articles F in a nested relationship at several supply positions 58 . Means 70 are also provided for situating containers 68 at loading stations 66 adjacent to said supply positions 58 . The articles F are lifted from the supply positions 58 and deposited into the containers 68 at the loading positions 66 . Each array of articles F comprises a separate layer in a box or container 68 . After such layers are deposited simultaneously at each of said loading stations 66 , the boxes 68 are advanced to the next loading station 66 wherein the cycle is repeated until the container 68 is filled. Preferably, a number of supply and loading positions 58, 66 and containers 68 is equal to the number of layers which will fit into the box 68 , so that the net result is having one box 68 filled for each machine cycle.
