# IMPROVEMENTS IN CATALYSTS

## Abstract
It has been found that synthetic microporous catalyst which are active in converting oxygen containing aliphatics into hydrocarbons can lose activity deactivation of the catalyst can be reduced significantly by mixing an organic additive which contains ethylenic unsaturation or a precur sor therefor with the feedstock.
