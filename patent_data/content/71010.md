# METHOD FOR PLANARIZING AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT STRUCTURE

## Abstract
A method is given for planarizing an integrated circuit structure just prior to the formation of metallurgy intercon nection lines on the integrated circuit. The method begins with the integrated circuit intermediate product having device elements 14, 16, 20 formed therein but before interconnection metallurgv 42, 44, 46 has been formed on the principal surface of the product. A glass layer 40 is deposited in a non conformal way onto the principal surface of the integrated circuit. The glass is chosen to have a thermal coefficient of expansion that approximates that of silicon and has a soflening temperature of less than about 1200 C. The structure is heated to cause the flow of glass 40 on the surface of the integrated circuit product to fill in the irregularities therein and to thereby planarize the integrated circuit surface. Openings are then formed through the glass 40 down to the device elements 14, 16, 20 of the integrated circuit. The interconnection metallurgy 42, 44, 46 is formed over the surface of glass 40 and through the openings of the glass to interconnect the device elements 14, 16, 20 of the integrated circuit. The glass 40 may be deposited by various methods which include the sedimenta tion methods of spraying, centrifuging and spin on plus sputtering or evaporation methods.
