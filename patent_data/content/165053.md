# Obturation in a firearm.

## Abstract
A riot control weapon comprises a barrel, a fixed breech block, and there between a chamber having a loading aperture through which a cylindrical round of ammunition can be inserted and ejected, the round being insertable by firstly a translational movement to bring the forward end of the round into the chamber, and secondly a rotational movement during which the round is pivoted until the round is fully chambered in alignment with the barrel, and wherein the chamber is provided with an obturating surface which extends continuously from a point adjacent the forward end of the chamber adjacent the loading aperture, rearwardly and away from the loading aperture to complete a closed loop within a cylindrical surface internally of the chamber, whereby the said rotational movement brings the round into sealing contact with the obturating surface around a com plete loop. In a preferred embodiment there is provided a stop adjacent the forward end of the chamber, the round coming into contact with the stop at the end of the said translational movement, and the stop acting as a pivotal point for the said rotational movement.
