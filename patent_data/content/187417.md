# Television receiver comprising a teletext decoding circuit and a page number memory.

## Abstract
A television receiver which is suitable for displaying teletext pages comprises a control system including a microcomputer. This microcomputer is coupled to a volatile memory which comprises a plurality of page number registers. A page number can be stored temporarily in each of these registers. With the aid of a keyboard the user makes known which page numbers he wants to have stored in the different registers and the stored page numbers represent a first series of pages. One single read key RCL is provided for the display of such a page. Each time this key is depressed once, a different page belonging to the first series appears on the picture screen. The sequence in which the pages appear is the same as the sequence in which the user has keyed in the relevant page numbers. This sequence can be interrupted by the occurrence of a preselected operating instruction in re sponse to which a number of teletext pages not associated with said first series can be displayed on the picture screen. Thereafter, the display of the teletext pages of the first series can be continued.
