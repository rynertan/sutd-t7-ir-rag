# Reforming catalysts and use thereof.

## Abstract
Nickel catalysts for the reforming of hydrocarbons, consisting of cylindrical or solid prismatic elements, their exterior lateral walls being grooved, and the spacing, depth and width being such that in relation to a non grooved cylinder or prism of identical height and size, the gas solid contact surface is increased while maintaining a sufficient crush strength.
