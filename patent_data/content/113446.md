# Encoder and decoder of variable length messages for data transmission systems.

## Abstract
Variable length message encoder, apt to operate on digital signals, endowed with reduction codes and synchronism signals, to effect a redundancy reduction, and message decoder, apt to separate and expand the above signals, after extracting them from parallel data blocks, obtained from a flow transmitted via a digital channel.
