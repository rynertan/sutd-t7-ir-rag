# Bar code reading device.

## Abstract
The bar code reading device comprises a semiconductor laser diode, a first end face of which is optically coupled to an end of an optical fibre, a second end face being optically coupled to a detector. The bar code information is presented to the other end of the optical fibre. This information is read by the semiconductor laser diode by way of optical feedback.
