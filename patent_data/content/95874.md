## Description
Melt extrudable anhydrous polyvinyl alcohol compositions and extruded articles therefrom This invention is concerned with melt extrudable anhydrous polyvinyl alcohol compositions. Present day packaging films are used to prepackage many foodstuffs, medicinal products,cosmetic products, etc. Films of, for example, regenerated cellulose, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinylidine chloride are commonly used for this purpose. These materials provide acceptable packaging where heat sealability, low cost and protection against humidity changes are required. However, use of an extruded film of one polymer usually does not provide long package life to materials susceptible to oxygen deterioration and multiple ply products made by post lamination and, in some instances, co extrusion at near melt temperatures, of a number of different polymers have been developed to provide optimum life to pre packaged goods sensitive to oxygen deterioration. It has long been known that films of polyvinyl alcohol ancl its copolymers with vinyl acetate are the most effective barrier polymers for fixed gases at low humidities, but that these films have poor moisture barrier properties and change in their barrier qualities for fixed gases at high humidities. Studies of the prior art indicate that films o polyvinyl alcohol or PVOH have been primarily made from aqueous solutions of the polymer or require the presence of some water in conjunction with water soluble plasticizers. In our prior art search every reference included a plasticizer characterized by having a plurality of hydroxyl groups in the molecule, for example glycerine, various glycols and other polyhydric compounds. The polyvinyl alcohol polymers known and used in making extruded products, such as films and laminates, have not been melt processed in the absence of melt processing additives and when in their pure homopolymeric form, no thermal processing methods are known to exist. The temperature ranges essential for such extrusion methods are known to cause decomposition of the homopolymer moulded melt extrusion products produced thereby are not commercially satisfactory.When copolymers containing up to about 85 polyvinyl alcohol PVOH and about 15 or more of polyvinyl acetate are plasticized with an aqueous solution of a water soluble glycol or polyglycol, extensive and corresponding costly modifications are required in the process and apparatus used to effect moulding or extrusion. Among the prior art patents relating to extruded polyvinyl alcohol products, the following are believed to be the most relevant. British Specification 1,544,780 describes a method wherein a mixture of water, glycerine or other watersoluble plasticizer and polyvinyl alcohol is co extruded along with a polyolefin, such as polypropylene, at a temperature above 1500C. Rapid decompression and venting are required to flash off the water vapour present. Rate of through put through the extrusion head is critical and vacuum is essential to aid water removal. Wysong, in U.S. Patents 4,156047 4,155,971 and 4,119,604, discloses the use of mixtures of low and medium molecular weight polyvinyl acetate alcohol copolymers, optionally with a vinyl alcohol methyl methacrylate copolymer , a polymeric polyethylene oxide liquid having a molecular weight of 380 to 420, and water. The extrusion process is operable only with partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol polymers. Japanese Patent Specification 73 29306 describes the extrusion polyvinyl alcohol with water. JapanesePatent Specification 5 09890 describes the production of blown polyvinyl alcohol films using a dry gas inside the bubble at 1000 2000c and further drying the outside of the bubble at 900 2000C from a mixture of 70 parts polymer, 30 parts water and an optional water soluble plasticizer, such as diethylene glycol. Westhoff et al, in Starch, 31,163 1979 describe mixtures of starch, 96 hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol, and a glycol glycoside from ethylene glycol and starch cast on to a silicone treated plate. The mixtures are not heat extrudable, however, and no thin films were ever produced. U.S. Patent 3.886,112 describes extruded mixtures of partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol with watersoluble polyols, suc as hexanediol, propylene glycol and tetramethylene glycol, in conjunction with less than 0.5 sodium borate. It is an inoperative system with fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol homopolymers. U.S. Patent 3,409,598 is the only prior document found which discloses the use of an anhydrous melt extrusion of partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol PVOEI . Homopolymers of vinyl alcohol were not shown to be melt extrudable under any conditions. This patent makes it clear that the only polymers melt extrudable under anhydrous conditions were those specifically produced from a copolymer by saponifying vinyl acetate or a copolymer of vinyl acetate preferably with small amounts of acrylic, maleic or itaconic acid, their esters or ethers . Further the saponification step requires the presence in the above specific vinyl acetate before polymerization see column 3, Example 1 ad before saponification, of a polyhydric alcohol. Some polyhydric alcohol essentially becomes a part of the resultant copolymer.That this.m ust be is reflected in the observation that when polyhydric alcohol is mixed after completing the saponification, it is inferior in its thermoplasticity as a conventional intermix after completing the saponification column lines 21 26 . Column 1, lines 54 59 also establish that it has been known that water and plasticizer are mixed with PVA polyvinyl alcohol to lower the melt viscosity of the PVA and the mixture is subjected to extrusion moulding . This patent therefore appears to provide self plasticized polyhydroxy copolymers. Our study of prior art has shown that it is considered essential to use water in conjunction with a plasticizer which is a selected water soluble polyhydric alcohol at least in the mixing step prior to the meltextrusion of hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols. The only exception found is that of U.S. Patent 3,409,598 where a special polymer is made in the presence of a watersoluble polyhydric alcohol. No known references indicate that a fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol has been satisfactorily melt extruded or injection moulded by prior art techniques. Water appears to be universal in the case of polyvinyl alcorlol polyvinyl acetate copolymer technology. Otherwise these polymers char rather than melt at the essential high temperatures of melting and extrusion. Glycerine and water are commonly used in combination in the extrusion or injection mass. Water aids in the deve oprncnt t the essential melt flow characteristics, improves the thermal stability of the polyner at moulding temperatures, and inhibits migration or exudation of the polyol plasticizer. The presence of water causes bubbles and imperfections in the extrudate, however, so that early de volatilization thereof is a prerequisite. Homopolymers of polyvinyl alcohol containing in excess of 95 vinyl alcohol polymer have not hitherto been melt extruded from anhydrous systems containing polyhydric alcohol and glycol or polyglycol or glycerine plasticizers. Our prior art study has shown that polyvinyl alcohol copolymers generally, containing from 85 to 95 polyvinyl alcohol and not fully hydrolyzed, have also not hitherto been melt extrudable in the absence of water and a water soluble polyhydroxy group containing plasticizer. According to the present invention, there is provided an improved melt extrudable composition which comprises at least one vinyl alcohol polymer and at least 5 by weight of a plasticiser, in which the plastlciser is a hydroxyl free organic material which is substantially water insoluble and non volatile at extrusion temperatures and has a solubility parameter greater than 10 cal cc 2. The composition according to the invention may be melt extrudable, injection or blow mouldable the the vinyl alcohol polymer may comprise a 100 hydrolyzed polymer of polyvinyl alcohol or a copolymer of polyvinyl alcohol, which may contain as much as 15 of polyvinyl acetate units and may be an olefin alcohol copolymer in which the olefin contains from 2 4 carbon atoms. As indicated above it is well known that cor lpletely hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols and copolymers of o1RvirlZl alcohols with polyvinyl acetate and other polymerizable monomers, and in particular olefin modified polyvinyl alcohols,have outstanding usefulness because of their low gas transmission rates, particularly for gaseous oxygen. It is well known in the packaging art that the principal cause of deterioration of packaged goods on storage is oxidative deterioration. Thus, the art is replete with attempts to produce films and injection moulded or blow moulded articles of polyvinyl alcohol as at least one layer of a packaging material,such as bottles and film wraps,to inhibit oxygen transmission through the packaging material. Fundamentally, this invention provides a melt extrudable polymer composition of matter which can provide, for example, packaging materials such as bottles and flexible films, which have exceptional resistance to permeation by gases, particularly oxygen. The melt extrudable anhydrous polyvinyl alcohol polymer compositions of this invention comprise at least one of the following sub classes which may be ed alone or in combination with one another. A. Fully hydrolyzed homopolymer of vinyl alcohol, in which the vinyl alcohol units are in excess of 95 preferably near 100 e.g. greater than 96 , more pvreferably greater than 98 . B. Copolymers of vinyl alcohol and vinyl acetate, which are arbitrarily defined as containing less than 95 polyvinyl alcohol units. Such copolymers preferably contain at least 85 vinyl alcohol units. C. The polymers of A or B where the poly vinyl alcohol polymers are copolymerised with from 5 to 40 of an olefin having 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Ethylene is the preferred olefin as ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers are presently commercially available. Other suitable polymers of this class, as described in U.S. Patent 3,585,177 contain from about 8 to 35 of a 2 to 4 carbon atom olefin modification including ethylene, propylene and isobutylene. D. Physical mixtures of each of the above three classes may be selected depending on say, price and end use, for the production of co extruded films, laminates, injection moulded articles, blow moulded articles, etc., monofilaments and films useful alone, or as substrates for packaging. Polymers of polyvinyl alcohol as described above are available in a variety of molecular weight ranges an appropriate choice of molecular weight can there fore be made in preparing a composition according to the invention. Polyvinyl alcohol polymers generally useful may range in molecular weights within the range of from 30,000 to 150,000. Proportions of varying molecular weight ranges may be co blended to modify, regulate and control the melt viscosity and melt temperature in amounts of, say 4 to 50 by weight of the conlposition according to the invention. The plasticizers used in the composition according to the invention are water insoluble organic compounds which are free from hydroxyl groups and further characterized by t hree additional limitations, namely the soittbility parameter is greater than 10 cal cc 2 tho plasticizer should be substantially water insoluble e.g. a water solubility of less than ,, and the plasticizer should be cssentially non volatile that. is have a negligible vapour pressure at extrusion temperatures e.g. up to 2320C . The plasticizer is generally used in excess of about 5 , and up to an upper limit of about 50 by weight of the polymer content. The plasticizers used in the invention do not embrace most of the well known plasticizers as are in common use with polyvinyl chloride, such as alcohol esters of phthalic acid propylene glycol dibenzoatc, ethylene glycol dibenzoate and di octyl adipate. Specific classes of plasticizers suitable for use in compositions according to the invention compriseN substituted long chain fatty amides long chain embracing the water insoluble aliphatic fatty acid amides from about 10 to 22 carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain ,alkyl, aryl e.g. alkaryl sulphonamides, N alkyl pyrrolidones, sulphonates of alkyl phenols, alkyl ad aryl phosphates and phosphites. and mixtures of two or more thereof. Specific members of the above classes which are readily available commercially include, by way of exmaple, the following materials Santicizer 9 para toluene sulphonamide , and Santicizer 8 a mixture of ortho and para isomers of N ethyl toluene sulphonamide , available from Monsanto Co. Mesamoli a sulphonated alkyl phenol from Mobay Chemical Co. Kronitex 50 said to be isopropyl phenyl di phenyl phosphate from FMC Corporation Hallcomid M 18 OL a dimethyl amide of oleic acid from C.P. Hall Co. and N cyclohexyl pyrrolidone GAF . Tile plasticizers decrease the melt viscosity of the polymers with increasing plasticize. content the melt viscosity, however, is more effectively regulated through control of the amount of the low molecular weight polymer components as is consistent with normal polymer behaviour. The compositions according to the invention can provide melt extruded or extrusion coated articles of manufacture which may be in single layer films, coextruded lamina ted films where one or more layers may be of another material, or they may be a layer of thicker sections as in blow moulded or injection moulded articles, as for example, bottles. The use of polyvinyl alcohol polymers in the oration of a variety of physical shapes and consisting of laminates of various compositions of polymeric films, sheets, rods, plates, concentric tubes, and complex geometric forms is, of course, known. However, the sub classes of polyvinyl alcohols described above have not previously been considered extrudable on standard equipment. The compositions according to the invention may be formulated just prior to and directly in commercial forming operations they can be used in a readily feedable particulate form for melt extrusion, blow moulding and injection moulding operations. The compositions according to the invention can be used in the manufacture of articles as described in U.S.Patent 4,254,169 and British Specification 1,544,780 without the requirement of proportionate feeding equipment, and other equipment essential to pre blending. Melt extrusion of compositions according to the invention under anhydrous conditions at temperatures of the order of 193 to 2270C enables clear, bubble free films characterized by extremely low gas transmission rates, particularly to oxygen, to be produced. A major advantage of compositions according to the invention, in addition to the controlled superior quality of the transparency of films produced therefrom and their freedom from sttrface imperfect ons , is that they can be processed iti machinery used in processing standard polymers, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene propylene copolymers, polyvinyl chloride and nylon. In order that the present invention may be more fully understood the following Examples are given by way.of illustration only. In the Examples all parts are by weight unless indicated to the contrary.EXAMPLE 1 One hundred parts of a 99 hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol homopolymer having a weight average molecular weight of about 100,000 Elvanol 71 30 was dried at 710C for 16 hours and mixed with 20 parts of p toluene sulphonamide Santicizer 9 , 10 parts of a mixture of the ortho and para isomers of N ethyl toluene sulphonamide Santicizer 8 and 2 parts of zinc stearate as lubricant. After extensive blending at high shear rate, the mixture was extruded through a 1.9 cm extruder equipped with 7.6 cm slot die. The extruder had a temperature profile of 149 , 1990, 2270C from the throat to the metering section with a die temperature of 2160C.Extruded films drawn to a thickness of 0.5 x 10 4m. extruded well, were free of surface defects and bubbles, which was indicative of commercially accepted quality.EXAMPLE 2 Eighty five parts of an 87 to 89 hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol copolymer having a molecular weight of about 138,000 Vinol 52 was dried for 2.5 hours at 82 930C and mixed with 15 parts of p toiuene sulphonamide and 2 parts of stearamide as lubricant.The essentially anhydrous powder was intensively mixeci and fecal into an extruder with a tempenature profile of 149 , 182 , 2040C from the throat to the metering section and a slot die temperature of 1 t ,0C . Fi Films of clear, fused PVOH copelymer film were extruded in thicknesses of 0.25 to 5 x 10 4m. While films drawn were soluble in cold water, the rate of dissolution was slower than films of the same polymer cast from an aqueous solution.EXAMPLE 3 Ninety parts of the polyvinyl alcohol copolymer of Example 2, similarly rendered anhydrous, were mixed with 10 parts of the sulphonated alkyl phenol plasticizer Mesamoll of Mobay Chemical and 2 parts of stearamide. After intensive mixing, the dry powder was fed through an extruder under the same controlled conditions as in Example 2. A water white or colourless film was smoothly extruded and drawn down to a 0.5 x 10 4m. thickness.EXAMPLE 4 Eighty parts of the dried polyvinyl alcohol copolymer of Example 2 were plasticized by the addition of 18 parts of Santicizer 8 an.d 2 parts of zinc stearate as lubricant. After thorough pre mixing and extrusion as set out in Example.2, the resulting clear films had the following properties RESIN PEEL STRENGTH kg cm Plexar 1.08 1.82 Macromelt 6901 1.58 PVC 0.0 Oxygen permeability At 0 Relative Humidity R.H. 60 cc mm 100 in 2 2 24 hours. At 100 R.H. 84 cc mm 100 in 2 24 hours.EXAMPLE 5 Fifty parts of a 99 hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol homopolymer of molecular weight of about 100,000 Vinol 125 and 40 parts of an 87 to 89 hydrolyzed copolymer of polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl acetate of about 1 38,000 molecular weight Vinol 523 were carefully dried to constant weight, intensively mixed with one part stearamide and 10 parts of a mixture of ortho and para isomers of N ethyl toluene sulphonamide Santicizer 8 and extruded as in Example I. Films from 0.25 to 1 x 10 4m in section were clear. Thicker sections exhibited a slight haze.EXAMPLE 6 Forty five parts of an 87 to 89 polyvinyl alcohol copolymer having a molecular weight of about 43,000 Vinol 205 and 45 parts of similarly hydrolyzed copolymer having a molecular weight of about 138,000, Vinol 523 see Example 5 , 2 parts of stearamide and 10 parts of Santicizer 8 were intensively mixed and extruded as in Example 2. The blend of low and medium weight polyvinyl alcohol copolymers extruded with a lower viscosity than when using the high molecualr weight copolymer alone as in Example 2.EXAMPLE 7 Ninety parts of copolymer of Vinol 205 seeExample 6 , 10 parts plasticizer p toluene sulphonamide and 2 parts zinc stearate were dried to constant weight and intensively mixed. The compound extruded with ease on a 1.9 cm extruder as detailed inExample 2. EXAMPLE 8 Ninety parts of Vinol 205 as in Example 6 and 10 parts of the dimethyl amide of oleic acid available from C. P. all Co. as Hallcomid M L30L and 2 parts zinc stearate were extruded as in Example 2. Except for a slight yellow cast the extruded films were comparable with Example 7 and Example 2.EXAMPLE 9 Comparative Seventy parts Vinol 523 as in Example 5 and 30 parts of an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer VAL F from Kuraray Co. Japanj were extensis ely mixed and dried. The extrudate was non homogeneous. A typical opaque substrate was formed upon exiting the die showing that the mixture was incompatible.EXAMPLE 10 Comparative Example 9 was repeated using 50 parts by weight of Vinol 205 see Example 6 and 50 parts of EVAL F ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. The composition upon extrusion was incompatible and non homogeneous. EXAMPLE 11 Eighty nine parts of the ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer EVAL F of Example 9 and 11 parts of p toluene sulphonamide were dried and intimately admixed. The dry blend extruded easily at 204 C, producing a clear film. The melt leaving the extruder had improved flow characteristics compared with the ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer alone under the same extruding conditions. The plasticized extruded film adhered yell to Plexar 6 Chemplex Co. film when heat bonded together for 30 seconds at 2320C.EXAMPLE 12 41 parts Vinol 523, 44 parts EVAL F, and 15 parts p toluene sulphonamide were extensively mixed, dried and extruded through an extruder having a temperature profile of 127 C,177 C and 2040C throat to a metering section having a die temperature of 204 C. The extrudate films was as clear as the film of Example 11 and adhered well to a polyamide Macronlelt 6900, Henkel Corp and other polymer blends containing polyvinyl alcohol polymers and copolymers and or ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer of varying olefin content.EXAMPLE 13 90 parts of a pre blend consisting of 45 parts of homopolymer of vinyl alcohol Eivancl 90 50 , having molecular weight from 50 75,000 45 parts of a similar homopolymer having a molecular weight of about 100,000 Elvanol 71 30 and 10 parts of isopropyl phenyl diphenyl phosphate Kronitex 50,F.M.C. Corp were intensively mixed. The blend was extruded under the conditions of Example 1. Some bubbling under the extrusion conditions was noted.On regrinding and re extrusion, the material had contact clarity and homogeneity.EXAMPLE 14 45 parts Elvanol 90 50 45 parts Elvanol 71 30 and 10 parts p toluene sulphonamide were intensively mixed and extruded under the conditions of Example 1.The extrudate was clear and few bubbles developed.The extruded compound was reground and re extruded three times. No significant increase in viscosity was observed However, a yellow colour developed and deepened after each re extrusion.EXAMPLE 15 The melt viscosities of the extrudates ofExamples 2 and 6 were measured at 2000C. Tile results show the regulating effect upon melt viscosity relative to the low molecular weight component, which is consistent with normal polymer behaviour. It is observed that the plasticizer exhibits of its effect in the temperature range near the extrusion temperatures, rather than at ambient temperatures.

Extrusion through a 7.5 cni w wide slot die at a melt temperature of 2130C resulted in a well fluxed and clear film. Compositions according to the invention can be melt extruded as a single layer film, or as a part of a multilayer structure, with cost savings relative to the prior art. Drying before melt extrusion is necessary as raw materials exposed to high humidity conditions may acquire objectionable water content. Intensive mixing before melt extrusion of the essential components can advantageously be carried out at about 1380C. The presence of olefin modified polyvinyl alcohol copolymers with homopolymers and copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol reduces the sensitivity of the extrudates to water exposure. Known polymer compositions containing major amounts of polyvinyl alcohol homopolymer and minor amounts of ethylene vinyl alcohol would not provide homogeneous extrudates this has been overcome according to the invention. The compositions according to the invention are quite 4 compatible and are readily extruded and co extruded. Excellent adhesion of the polymer blends of this invention co extruded with commercial polymers such as Plexar , certain modified polyesters, some polyamides and other olefin modified copolymers, can be achieved. The solubility parameter as used in the fore going description and in the following clams is the parameter 8 defined on page IV 342 of Polymer Handbook edited by S. Brandrup and E.H.
