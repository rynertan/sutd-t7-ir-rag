## Description
PYR I DYL OXY TIO PHENOXY COMPOUNDS, HERBICIDAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS This invention relates a to novel pyridyl oxy thio phenoxy compounds, b to herbicidal compositions of such novel compounds and c to methods of using such compounds for the preemergent and postemergent control of grassy weeds in non crop areas as well as in the presence of certain valuable crops such as soybeans, cotton and wheat. Belgian Patent No. 834,495, issued February 2, 1976, as well as the published German patent application eguivalent thereto, viz., No. 2,546,251, publishedApril 29, 1976, describe 2 4 pyridinyl 2 oxy phenoxy alkanoic acids, salts and esters having halo substItution in the 3 and or 5 ring positions in the pyridine ring.Later references, e.g. published British Patent application 2,026,865 disclose such compounds having trifluoromethyl substitution on the pyridine ring andEuropean Patent Application 0002800 describes the enhanced effect of the D stereoisomers of such compounds. The present invention is directed to novel pyridyloxy thio phenoxy compounds having herbicidal activity and which correspond to the formula EMI2.1 wherein X is CF3, CHFz CClF2, Br or Cl T is O or S and Z is an organic moiety containing N, O or S atoms or a metallic, ammonium or organic amine cation and is or can be hydrolyzed and or oxidized in plants or soil to a carboxyl moiety that is in undissociated and or dissociated form. The invention is also directed to the novel stereoisomers of such compounds, the R isomers having exceptional activity. A variety of herbicidal compounds containing substituted pyridyl and phenoxy moieties joined via a bivalent 0 and S are described in the art. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,046,553 4,317,913 4,267,336 4,213,774 4,324,627 and 4,309,547 and European Patent 483 all describe such compounds, methods of making them, compositions containing them and methods of utilizing said compositions.In general, the moieties bonded to the pendant 0 group of the phenoxy in the herbicidal compounds described in these references will also be suitable as the monovalent organic radical represented by Z in the formula for the aforementioned novel compounds and, given the appropriate pyridine starting material, the compounds of this invention can be prepared by methods described in the above mentioned prior art, and can be utilized in compositions as described in said prior art Z moieties include, but are not limited toEMI3.1 wherein Y is a saturated or unsaturated alkyl group containing an even number of carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 18 carbon atoms, n is 0 or 1, 21 is H or aC1 C3 alkyl group and R2 is a group corresponding to one of the following formulae CN,EMI3.2 EMI3.3 wherein X is halogen, or CN,EMI3.4 wherein M is a metallic cation, ammonium or an organic amine cation typically, but not exclusively, containing alkyl saturated or unsaturated , alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic groups, all unsubstituted or substituted with various other groups not limited to, but including, halo, cyano, nitro and unsubstituted or substituted thiol, hydroxy, amino or carboxyl groups and, additionally, alicyclic, heterocyclic and aromatic groups substituted with unsubstituted or substituted saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups, for example, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, cyanomethyl and vinyl, CH2OR ,EMI4.1 EMI5.1 EMI6.1 EMI6.2 where X is S or O, where W is halogen R3 is H or R6 R4 is H, alkoxy orR6 R5 is H, a metallic cation or R6 and R6 is an alkyl saturated or unsaturated , alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic group, unsubstituted or substituted with various other groups not limited to, but including, halo, cyano, nitro and unsubstituted or substituted thiol, hydroxy, amino or carboxyl groups and, additionally, alicyclic, heterocyclic and aromatic groups substituted with unsubstituted or substituted saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups, for example, trifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, cyanomethyl and vinyl,EMI7.1 EMI7.2 where A is o, S or N, orEMI7.3 where R7 completes an unsubstituted or substituted saturated heterocyclic ring system. The above derivatives can be made by processes generally known to those skilled in the art and as described in the above mentioned patents For example, the corresponding acid chlorides can besreacted with aGrignard reagent to make the desired aldehyde or ketone derivative. Similarly, reaction of an acid chloride with KSH will provide the desired thiol acid. Thioamides may be prepared from the corresponding amide by reaction with P2 S5 or, if hydrogen is present on the nitrogen atom, the carbonyl may be converted to, e.g., chloride, with removal of HC1, followed by reaction with hydrogen sulfide. Carbamoyl chlorides are available in the art or they may be prepared from the desired amine and phosgene or thiophosgene for use in making compounds containing theEMI8.1 group. The reaction of an amine with a sulfonyl chloride, e.g., R5NH2 R6SO2Cl provides the groupEMI8.2 for use in reacting with an appropriate acid chloride. The reaction of an amine with BrCN provides, e.g.,EMI8.3 which reacts with the appropriate acid chloride to provide compounds containing theEMI8.4 moiety. P2 S5 is employed to make the correspondingS containing compound. Reaction of the above cyanoamine with phosgene or thiophosgene providesEMI9.1 for use in making the corresponding derivatives. The reaction of the compounds having the moietyEMI9.2 with PCl5 will provide compounds having the moietyEMI9.3 The reaction of the corresponding acid chloride with RONH2 will provide compounds having the groupEMI9.4 Various hydrazine derivatives can be made, e.g., from trimethyl hydrazine by reaction with the acid chlorides. The reaction of the amides, e.g.,EMI9.5 with dicarboxylic anhydrides will provide compounds having the group EMI10.1 R2 is preferably a carboxylic acid group, an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt thereof, an ammonium or organic amine salt thereof or a lower alkyl ester thereof, wherein lower alkyl includes straight, branched or cyclic saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups containing no more than 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, n is 0. In the above formulae the aliphatic groups preferably contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms, the alkenyl and alkynyl groups preferably contain 2 to 6 carbon atoms, Cle alicyclic groups preferably contain 3 to 6 carbon atoms and the aromatic moiety is preferably phenyl, although other ring systems, including heterocyclic ring systems, may be employed if desired. In the formula for the aforementioned novel compounds, T is preferably 0 and X is preferably CF3, Cl or Br. Most preferred are the compounds in which X is CF3 or Cl, T is 0, and Z isEMI10.2 wherein R is methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl or n butyl. The compounds of the above formula, hereinafter referred to for convenience as 1,active ingredients , have been found to be especially active as herbicides for the control of undesired vegetation, for example, grassy or graminaceous weeds and are unexpectedly more effective than the compounds of the known art.Especially surprising is the finding that the unexpected activity of the presently claimed compounds is specifically related to fluorine substituted in the 3 position of the pyridine ring fluorine substitution in other positions on the pyridine ring, e.g., the 5 position, does not cause unusually beneficial activity result. With the compounds of this invention, it is possible to employ lower dosage rates and still obtain effective control thus reducing plant residues and any potential environmental contamination and or toxicological effect on fish and warm blooded animals.. Accordingly, the present invention also encompasses herbicidal compositions containing one or more of these active ingredients as well as preemergent and postemergent methods of controlling undesired plant growth, especially in the presence of valuable crops.Such methods comprise applying a herbicidally effective amount of one or more of said active ingredients to the locus of the undesired plants, that is, the seeds,.foliage, rhizomes, stems and roots or other parts of the growing plants or soil in which the plants are growing or may be found. The term herbicide is used herein to mean an active ingredient which controls or adversely modifies the growth of plants because of phytotoxic or other effects substantial enough to seriously retard the growth of the plant or further to damage the plant sufficiently to kill the plant. By growth controlling or herbicidally effective amount is meant an amount of active ingredient which causes a modifying effect and includes deviations from natural development, killing, regulation, desiccation, retardation, and the like. The term plants is meant to include germinant seeds, emerging seedlings, rhizomes, stolons and other underground propagules, and established vegetation. The active ingredients, i.e., new compounds, of the present invention are readily prepared by processes described in the above cited prior art by choosing the appropriate starting materials. The stereoisomers are readily separated as described inEuropean 0002800 referred to above. Certain of the pyridine reactants employed to make the novel pyridinyloxyphenoxy compounds of this invention are themselves novel compounds and such reactants may be made as generally described hereafter and as specifically set forth in the following examples or by methods analagous thereto, starting with known compounds We have unexpectedly found that the fluorine atom in 3 chloro 2 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine can be readily replaced with a 2 cyano group by reacting said pyridine compound with an alkali metal cyanide, preferably potassium cyanide, in a polar aprotic solvent, preferably dimethylsulfoxide, at a temperature of 16s 500C,, preferably 200 300C We have further found that the chlorine atom in the resulting product, ie., 3 chloro 2 cyano 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine is readily selectively replaced with fluorine by reaction with, e.g., cesium or potassium fluoride in a polar aprotic solvent, preferably dimethyl sulfoxide, at a temperature of 800 1400C., preferably 900 1000C. The cyano group in the resulting 2 cyano 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine can be readily converted, by known procedures, to the corresponding acid or amide, as desired. The resulting acid may be readily converted to the corresponding bromine derivative by the Hunsdiecker reaction, as shown in the following Example 4, or the amide may be converted to the corresponding amine and then hydroxy compound by the Hoffmann hypobromite reaction followed by diazotization and replacement by hydroxide as known in the art.The latter is then treated with POCl3 plus PCl5, as known in the art, to prepare, for example, 2 chloro 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine. Alternatively, 2, 3 difluoro 5 trifluoro methyl pyridine may be prepared by contacting 2, 3 dichloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine or 3 chloro 2 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridine with a fluorinating agent and the 2,3 difluoro 5 tri fluoromethyl pyridine may be used directly to make 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy alkanoic acids and derivatives.

These compounds, the active ingredients of the present invention, have been found to have advantage over prior art compounds in the control of annual and perennial grassy weeds in that the present compounds control such weeds at substantially lower dosage rates. In addition, the present compounds are sufficiently tolerant towards most broad leafed crops to contemplate control of grassy weeds therein at substantially commercially practicable levels, particularly so with the preferred compounds.In addition, certain of the compounds have sufficient tolerance towards cereal crops such as wheat to enable selective grassy weed control in these crops as well. For such uses, unmodified active ingredients of the present invention can be employed. However, the present invention embraces the use of the compounds in composition form with an inert material, known in the art as an agricultural adjuvant or carrier, in solid or liquid form. Thus, for example, an active ingredient can be dispersed on a finely divided solid and employed therein as a dust or granule. Also, the active ingredients, as liquid concentrates or solid compositions comprising one or more of the active ingredients can be dispersed in water, typically with aid. of a wetting agent, and the resulting aqueous dispersion employed as a spray.In other procedures, the active ingredients can be employed as a constituent of organic liquid compositions, oil in water and water in oil emulsions or water dispersions, with or without the addition of wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents. Suitable adjuvants of the foregoing type are well known to those skilled in the art. The herbicidally effective concentration of the active ingredients in solid or liquid compositions generally is from 0.0003 to 95 percent by weight or more. Concentrations from 0.05 to 50 percent by weight are often employed. In compositions to be employed as concentrates, the active ingredient can be present in a concentration from 5 to 98 weight percent. The active ingredient compositions can also contain other compatible additaments, for example, phytotoxicants, plant growth regulants and other biologically active compounds used in agriculture. In further embodiments, the compounds of the present invention or compositions containing the same, can be advantageously employed in combination with one or more additional pesticidal compounds. Such additional pesticidal compounds may be insecticides, nematocides, miticides, arthropodicides, herbicides, fungicides or bactericides that are compatible with the compounds of the present invention in the medium selected for application and not antagonistic to the activity of the present compoundµ. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the pesticidal compound is employed as a supplemental toxicant for the same or for a different pesticidal use or as an additament. The compounds in combination can generally be present in a ratio of from 1 to 100 parts of the compound of the present invention with from 100 to 1 parts of the additional compound s . The active ingredients of the present invention have been found to possess desirable herbicidal activity in general against grassy weeds such as foxtail, barnyardgrass, wild oats, seedling johnsongrass and crabgrass in preemergent operations and also against the same grasses in postemergent operations while being tolerant to important broadleaf crops such as cotton, soybeans, sugarbeets and rape and in the case of certain of the compounds, certain cereal crops such as wheat. These compounds are also uniquely effective in selectively controlling perennial grassy weeds such as johnsongrass, quackgrass, bermudagrass and dallisgrass. The active ingredients of the present invention have been found to possess particularly desirable herbicidal activity against wild oats, foxtail, barnyardgrass, crabgrass and seedling johnsongrass in postemergent operations as well as desirable broad spectrum activity against the perennial grassy weeds listed above and at lower dosage rates than the substituted propanoates and propanols of the prior art while showing high selectivity to broadleaf crops and, in the case of certain of the compounds, wheat. The present compounds which are substituted propanols or propyl ethers are more effective in preemergent operations than in postemergent applications. The exact rate to be applied is dependent not only on a specific active ingredient being applied, but also on a particular action desired, the plant species to be modified and the stage of growth thereof as well as the pa rt of the plant to be contacted with the toxic active ingredient. Thus, all of the active ingredients of the present invention and compositions containing the same may not be equally effective at similar concentrations or against the same plant species. In postemergent operations a dosage of about 0.05 to about 20 pounds acre 0.056 22.4 kg hectare is generally applicable, although not all compounds are equally effective and some weeds are more difficult to control. Thus, a dosage rate in the range of about 0.01 to. about 1.0 pound acre 0.01 1.12 kg hectare is preferred in postemergent control of annual grassy weeds, while about 0.05 to about 5 pounds acre 0.056 5.6 kg hectare is a preferred dosage range for the postemergent control of perennial grassy weeds. In applications to tolerant crops a weed controlling but less than crop damaging amount of from about .005 to about 1.0 lb acre 0.0056 to 1.12 kgs hectare is generally employed. In preemergent operations a dosage rate of 0.01 to 10 lbs acre 0.011 to 11.2 kgs hectare , preferably 0.05 to 2.0 lbs acre 0.056 to 2.25 kgs hectare and most preferably 0.1 to 1 lb acre 0.11 to 1.12 kgs hectare is generally employed. The following examples illustrate effects of the compounds of this invention.Example 18 In representative operations, each compound to be utilized in a series of tests is dissolved in acetone to one half of the final volume twice the final concentration to be used and the acetone solution in each case is admixed with an equal volume of water containing 0.1 percent by weight of the non ionic surfactant TWEENY 20 a polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate . The compositions, generally in the nature of an emulsion, were employed to spray separate respective plant species which had been grown to a height of 2 6 inches in soil of good nutrient content in a greenhouse.Sufficient amounts were employed to provide various application rates as listed in the table. The various beds were positioned side by side and exposed to substantially identical conditions of temperature and light. Each bed was maintained so as to prevent any interaction with test compounds in different seed beds.Other portions of the plants were left untreated to serve as controls. After treatment, the plants were maintained for about two weeks under greenhouse conditions conducive for good plant growth and watered as necessary. The specific plant species, test compound and dosage and the percent postemergent control obtained are set forth in the table below. Control refers to the reduction in growth compared to the observed results of the same untreated species. Note the means not tested .
