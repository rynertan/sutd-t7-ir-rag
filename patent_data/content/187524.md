## Description
The present invention relates to a novel diaryl butyric acid derivative and the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as well as a production process thereof. More specifically, it relates to a diaryl butyric acid derivative or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which is effective for ameliorating and curing or treating various symptoms based on cerebral organic disorders or cerebral dysfunction or brain organic syndrome and pathergasia. The term cerebral organic disorders used herein means various symptoms derived from cerebral ischemic disorders or diseases such as cerebral infarct sequela, cerebral hemorrhage sequela, and cerebral arteriosclerosis sequela and various organic disorders derived from senile dementia, dementia presenilis, amnesia, cephalic traumatic sequela, and cerebral operation sequela. Furthermore, the term pathergasia used herein means psychogender organic diseases like mania, melancholia, neurosis, Parkinson s disease, schizophrenia, schizophrenia like disorders, and chorea or Huntington s chorea as well as various syndromes derived from medicines and alcoholic beverages. Cerebral cells retain their own intracellular environments which are completely different from the surrounding environments, i.e., extracellular fluids, and while this difference is maintained, cerebral cells are alive. For this reason, it is necessary for energy to be always generated and supplied to cerebral cells. Most of the energy required by cerebral nerve cells is supplied by oxygen and glucose. These energy sources are not substantially stored in the brain and, therefore, are always to be supplied from the blood. If certain cerebral disturbances or disorders occur, and if the supply of oxygen and glucose to the brain is stopped, generally there is a gradual or stepwise progression in energy cacochimia. As a result, the cells lose their functions with the elapse of time, and the cells are soon organically broken. Thus, the cerebral cells cannot effect their normal functions. Therefore, a mechanism to adjust cerebral bloodstreams in the cerebral blood vessels themselves has been fully developed to stably supply the energy sources to the cerebral tissues and to maintain the outer environments of cerebral nerve cells. Various cerebral circulation ameliorating agents or circulating improvers , cerebral vasodilators, and cerebral excitometabolites have been heretofore used for the medical treatment of cerebral blood vessel disorders. However, although these medicines are effective for ameliorating subjective symptoms, no substantial amelioration in neural symptoms and mental symptoms are observed. Of these medicines, it is reported in, for example, JP A 58 110547, JP A 55 17329 and JP B 41 732 that 4 amino butyric acid derivatives are considered to be effective for curing dementia and amnesia. Furthermore, it is proposed in, for example, JP A 50 24276 and JP A 52 19672 that diaryl butyric acid derivatives are useful as medicines for treatment of central nervous system disorders. In addition, although various medical studies have been made into the amelioration and cure of senile dementia, there still remain many problems to be solved because of the presence of various psychogender functional symptoms. For this reason, families and other persons must take great care when nursing these patients, which need becomes a serious social problem. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel compound having effective activities for ameliorating and curing or treating various symptoms caused by the above mentioned various cerebral disorders or brain syndromes. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description.

The physical properties of the resultant compounds are as follows Various activities of certain compounds prepared in the above mentioned Synthesis Examples were evaluated as follows. The toxicity i.e., 50 lethal dose LD₅₀ of the compounds according to the present invention was 110 to 500 mg kg or more when the so called up and down method, in which the sample compound was intraperitoneally injected into ddY STF mice, was used. Male ddY mice having a body weight of 22 to 30 g were used i.e., 6 mice in one group . The sample compound prepared in the Synthesis Example 1 or 7 was intraperitoneally injected into the mice and the mice were decapitated 30 minutes after the injection. After decapitation, the gasping times were determined. The results were compared with a control group to which only the saline was injected. In addition, when the compounds obtained in the Synthesis Example Nos. 6, 15, 19, 30, 32, and 33 were injected at a dose of 50 mg kg or less, there was a significant difference in the extension of the gasping time. Male ddY mice having a body weight of 22 to 30 g were used i.e., 7 to 10 mice in one group . The mice were placed in a desiccator having a volume of about 1 liter and the desiccator was evacuated and adjusted by a vacuum pump to a pressure of 180 mmHg. Then, the sample compound prepared in the Synthesis Example 1 or 7 was intraperitoneally injected into the mice. The desiccator was evacuated 30 minutes after the injection and the time from the start of the evacuation to the termination of breathing by the mice was determined to be the survival time. If a mouse was still alive 15 minutes after exposure to the hypoxia, the survival time was assumed to be 15 minutes. The results were compared with a control group, to which only the physiological saline was injected. In addition, when the compound obtained in the Synthesis Example No. 33 was injected at a dose of 50 mg kg or less, there was a significant difference in the extension of the survival time. However, the compound obtained in the Synthesis Example 19 reduced the survival time, compared with the control group. Male ddY mice having a body weight of 22 to 30 g were used i.e., 7 to 10 mice in one group . The sample compound prepared in the Synthesis Example 1 or 7 was intraperitoneally injected into the mice and, 30 minutes later, the mice were placed in a desiccator having a volume of about 1 liter and filled with a gas mixture of 96 N₂ and 4 O₂. The survival time up to the termination of breathing by the mice was determined. During the test, the N₂ O₂ gas mixture was continuously supplied at a rate of 3 ℓ min. When the survival time was more than 15 minutes, the survival time was assumed to be 15 minutes. The results were compared with a control group, to which only a physiological saline was injected. Male mice having a body weight of 22 to 30 g were used i.e., 7 to 10 mice in one group . The sample compound prepared in the Synthesis Example 1 or 7 was intraperitoneally injected into the mice and, 15 minutes later, 5 mg kg of hemicholinium No. 3 was injected into the tail vein of the mice. The time from the injection of hemicholinium No. 3 to the termination of breathing by the mice was determined to be the survival time. The results were compared with that of a control group to which only a physiological saline was injected. A Male Wister rats having a body weight of 350 to 380 g were used. A rat was decapitated and the whole brain other than the cerebellum was homogenized in 10 times volume of ice cooled 50 mM buffered saline PBS having a pH of 7.4. The homogenized mixture was then centrifugally separated and the resultant supernatant frozen at a temperature of 30 C. The frozen specimen was melted in flowing water and was then diluted with 3 times volume PBS to prepare the diluted homogenate. A 10 µℓ of a solution of the sample compound prepared in the Synthesis Example 1 or 7 was added to 1 mℓ of the diluted homogenate obtained above and the mixture was incubated at a temperature of 37 C for 30 minutes. Thereafter, 200 µℓ of an ice cooled 35 HClO₄ solution was added and the mixture was shaken to terminate the reaction. The mixture was centrifugally separated for 10 minutes at 3,000 rpm. A 0.5 mℓ amount of the resultant supernatant was used for the so called TBA reaction see H. Ohkawa, N. Ohishi, and K. Yagi, Anal. Biochem., The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mℓ of the supernatant, 0.2 mℓ of 0.2 SDS, 1.5 mℓ of 20 NaOAc, 1.5 mℓ of 0.8 TBA, and 0.3 mℓ of H₂O. As is the case of the test compound solution, 10 µℓ of the standard solution of tetramethoxypropane TMP was prepared and was added to the reaction mixture in amounts of 0 to 10 nmole tube. The reaction mixture was heated to a temperature of 95 C for 60 minutes in a water bath. After cooling, 1 mℓ of water and 5 mℓ of a mixed solvent of butanol and pyridine 15 1 was added. The extraction was effected for 5 minutes in a shaking machine. Thereafter, the resultant layers were stabilized for 10 minutes at 2,000 rpm and the absorbance of the organic layer at 532 nm or the fluorescence intensity of the organic layer at 553 nm excited at 515 nm were determined. The lipid peroxide content was determined and represented a nmole number of malon dialdehyde MDA per mg of protein. The protein was determined by a Lawry method i.e., Lawry et al., J. Biol. Chem., The results are as follows. B Male ddY mice having a body weight of 24 to 27 g were used i.e., 5 to 9 mice in one group . After 16 to 17 hours nestia, 85 mg kg of alloxan was rapidly injected into the tail vein of the mice. After injecting the alloxan, the mice were subjected to free feeding and free water intaking and, 24 hours later, the sample compound was intraperitoneally injected into the mice. After further 24 hours, anesthesia was applied to the nice with ether and the blood of alvine aorta and cava was sampled. The amounts of the lipid peroxides in the blood serum were quantitatively measured according to a Yagi s method i.e., K. Yagi, Biochem. Med., The results were compared with that of a control group to which only a physiological saline was injected. As a result, at a dose of 50 mg kg, the compounds of the Synthesis Examples 3, 12, 13, 18, 28, 31, and 33 made a significant difference in the inhibition of the formation of the lipid peroxides. The compounds of the synthesis Examples 1, 4, 6, 9, 29, and 36 caused inhibition at a dose of 10 mg kg, and the compounds of the Synthesis Examples 8 and 16 caused inhibition at a dose of 5 mg kg. Ten male ddY mice having a body weight of 22 to 30 g were used as one group. A slit was located between a light room and a dark room. In the dark room, an arrangement was made whereby an electric shock was given to the feet by an electric current. Thus, the behavior of the mice in relation to step through to the dark room was studied. The mice were amnesically treated with an administration of scopolamine with or without the injection of the sample compound 1 or 7 and the time taken to avoid step through by the mice to the dark room was determined by the so called step through passive avoidance learning method. The electric current used was 0.6 mA. The scopolamine was hypodermically injected in an amount of 0.5 mg kg at 20 minutes prior to the first session and the sample compound was intraperitoneally injected immediately after the first session. The retention test i.e., the second session was carried out 24 hours later. The results are as follows. Male ddY mice having a body weight of 22 to 30 g were used i.e., 5 mice in one group . The sample compound prepared in the Synthesis Example 1 or 7 was intraperitoneally injected in a dose of 100 mg kg, 200 mg kg, or 500 mg kg. None of the mice died.
