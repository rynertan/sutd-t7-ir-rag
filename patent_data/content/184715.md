# COPOLYESTER COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
Disclosed are blends of low melting, slowly crystallizing copolyesters or of substantially amorphous copolyesters hav ing relatively high glass transition temperatures containing very small amounts of low molecular weight polyolefins. These blends have sharply increased crystallinity and crystallization rates and provide significant improvements in production be cause of the enhanced crystallization.
