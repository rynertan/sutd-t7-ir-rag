# Disk loading and unloading system.

## Abstract
A disk loading and unloading system 5 including a disk holding section 10, 11, 15, 16, 23 mounted for pivotal movement with respect to a main body of the system. When the disk holding section 10, 11, 15, 16, 23 is pivotally moved outwardly away from the main body, the disk holding section 10, 11, 15, 16, 23 moves to an upper position in which at least a portion of a disk 6 supported in the disk holding section clears the disk holding section and is exposed to view. Thus the disk 6 can be removed from the disk holding section by holding its side edge by hand.
