# SOLID ACID CATALYSTS AND PROCESS OF PRODUCING THE SAME

## Abstract
A solid acid catalyst is obtained by washing niobium hydroxide with water, optionally treating it with sulphuric acid or hydrofluoric acid to obtain hydrated niobium oxide Nb₂O₅ nH₂O and then heat treating the hydrated niobium oxide at a low temperature in the range of 100 to 400 C, preferably 200 to 300 C. The solid acid catalyst is catalytical ly active in olefin hydration reactions and other acid catalysed reactions involving water, such as hydrolysis, esterification and Beckman transformation reactions.
