# GRAIN ORIENTED SILICON STEEL AND STRESS COATING THEREFOR

## Abstract
An improvement in a stress coating composition containing colloidal silica, metal phosphate and hexavalent chromium for application to grain oriented silicon steels after final high temper ature texture annealing to develop tensile stress in the steel is divided by replacing 5 to 50 of said colloidal silica with finely powdered silica to increase the viscosity of the stress coating composition and permit the coating to be applied in a uniform and controlled coating thickness to the silicon steel in strip form.
