# Preparation of carboxylated latices and compositions containing them.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a carboxylated latex contain ing an N alkylolamide of an unsaturated carboxylic acid comprises carrying out the polymerisation reaction in two or more stages in which the majority or all of the N alkylolamide monomer is supplied to the second stage. The reaction may be carried out using a batch procedure but a continuous reaction is preferred. The product latex is par ticularly suitable for paper and textile applications and especially for use in paper coating compositions.
