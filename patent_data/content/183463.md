# Low temperature curing maintenance coatings.

## Abstract
A low temperature curing coating composition contain ing 10 80 by weight of binder and 20 90 by weight of an organic solvent in which the binder is 1 a polymer of polymerized monomers selected from the following group styrene, methyl methacrylate, an alkyl methacrylate, an alkyl acrylate, each having 2 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group and the polymer having pendant amino ester groups or hydroxy aminoester groups 2 an epoxy resin and 3 a polyamine curing agent. The composition is used as a primer or topcoating for metal substrates and curings at temperatures of 0 C to ambient temperatures and at high relative humidty and provides a primer that has excellent adhesion to the substrate and provided a durable, corrosion resistant finish.
