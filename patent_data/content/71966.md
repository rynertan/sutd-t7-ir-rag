# PROCESS FOR SEPARATING PORPHYRINS AND RESIN ADSORBENT USED THEREFOR

## Abstract
A process for separating prophyrins, which com prises 1 adjusting the pH of the liquid phase of a culture broth containing at least two porphyrins to about 2.5 to about 4 and collecting the resulting solid containing the porphyrins, 2 either a preparing an acidic aqueous solution of said solid and adjusting the pH of its liquid phase left after removal of insoluble matter to about 6 to about 8 to form an aqueous solution containing the porphyrins, or b preparing an acid containing lower alcohol solution of said solid, adjusting the pH of its liquid phase left after removal of insoluble matter, add ing water in an amount at least twice the amount of the solution to precipitate lower alkyl esters of the por phyrins, collecting the precipitates and dissolving them in an organic solvent to form an organic solvent solu tion of the porphyrin esters, 3 contacting the solution obtained in a or b in step 2 with a copolymer having a surface area of at least about 700 mÂ² g and derived from i divinylbenzene, ii styrene or its functional derivative, iii an alkenyl ester of a benzenepolycarboxylic acid represented by the following formula
