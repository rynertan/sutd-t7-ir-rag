## Description
FUEL PUMPSThis invention relates to fuel pumps and in particular to pumps for delivering fuel to the reheat system of a gas turbine engine.Gas turbine engine reheat systems are operated only intermittently and are supplied with fuel from a pump which is separate from that used for supplying fuel to the main burners of the engine. The reheat pump impeller is supported in a cantilever fashion in bearings and is typically constantly driven by turbine which is supplied with air from the engine compressor.The pump inlet may be shut off by way of a valve so that the pump is emptied when the reheat system is not in use. Such an arrangement is disclosed in U.K. Patent 1423363. It is a disadvantage of such an arrangement that fuel seals in the pump can overheat when the pump is empty. It has been proposed to overcome this disadvantage by providing a separate coolant flow for the.fuel seals. However, the space needed for such a coolant flow has the effect that the pump impeller overhangs its supporting bearings by an unacceptable amount.It is an object of the invention to provide a pump suitable for a gas turbine engine reheat system, in which the foregoing disadvantages are overcome.According to the invention a fuel pump includes a housing having an inlet and an outlet, a valve device for shutting off said inlet, an impeller for urging fuel from said inlet to said outlet, and a sealing arrangement between said impeller and said housing, said sealing arrangement comprising a rigid annular sealing element engageable with said impeller, biassing means urging said sealing element away from engagement, and means for applying a pressure signal for urging said sealing element into said engagement.In a particular embodiment said pressure signal is derived from a zone within said pump immediately downstream of said valve device.In a preferred embodiment said sealing element is supported by an annular carrier and said pressure signal is applied to said carrier.An embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example only and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a reheat system for a gas turbine engine, incorporating a pump according to the invention,Figure 2 shows to an enlarged scale, a sealing arrangement within the pump of Figure 1, andFigures 3 and 4 show plan and side views of a spring washer forming part of the sealing arrangement ofFigure 2.As shown in Figure 1 a gas turbine engine 10 may be supplied with fuel through a line 11 from a main burner control system 12 which includes a high pressure pump not shown . The system 12 is supplied from a backing pump 13. The pump 13 supplies fuel at a pressure of 165 psi 1.14 x 106 Pascals . The backing pump 13 also supplies fuel to the inlet 14 of a pump 15 from whose outlet 16 fuel can flow to reheat burners of the engine 10. The pump 15 includes a valve closure element 17 which is biassed by a spring 18 towards sealing engagement with a seat 19 and is movable against the bias of spring 18 by a pressure signal in a line 26. It is arranged that the closure element 17 is operated only in the fully open position shown or in shutting engagement with the seat 19. A vane impeller 20 is journalled in a thrust bearing 21 in the pump housing 22 so as to extend in cantilever fashion from the bearing 21. The outlet 16 includes a divergent portion not shown by means of which velocity head in the outlet 16 may be converted to pressure head, and a combined shut off and dump valve 23 which can be opened against a spring bias by the pressure head in the outlet 16, to pass fuel to the engine 10. In its shut conditions the valve 23 connects the pump outlet 16 to a drain 27.A fuel control arrangement 24 which may be of a type disclosed in U.K. Patent 1423363, regulates fuel flow to the reheat burners. Between the impeller 20 and the housing 22 is a sealing arrangement 25 which is shown in more detail in Figure 2.As shown in Figure 2 the sealing arrangement 25 comprises concentric rigid annular sealing elements 30, 31 which are engageable with a face 32 of the impeller 20. The radially outer sealing element 30 is mounted on a carrier 33 which is axially and sealingly slidable relative to a support plate 34 and a part 35 of the sealing arrangement 25. A pin 36 is mounted in the part 35 and passes with slight clearance through the carrier 33 to prevent relative rotation between the latter and the part 35. A spring washer 37 is engaged between the carrier 33 and a retaining ring 38 in the part 35. The washer 37 is shown in more detail in Figures 3 and 4 and has a wave like shape. The washer 37 is oriented in the housing so as to lie clear of the pin 36 and is maintained in this orientation by a tab 39 which engages a recess not shown in the part 35.The radially inner sealing element 31 is mounted on a carrier 40 which is axially slidable within the plate 34. A plurality of pins 41 is engaged between the carriers 33, 40 so that the carrier 40 is also restrained against rotation relative to the part 35. A spring washer 42 is engaged between the carrier 40 and plate 34, to urge the sealing element 31 against the face 32 of the impeller 20.A passage 43 in the housing 22 communicates with a zone of the pump immediately downstream of the valve seat 19 Figure 1 so that the delivery pressure from the backing pump 13 is applied to the passage 43 immediately the closure element 17 is moved to an open position. The pressure in the passage 43 is applied to an annular chamber 44 to urge the carrier 33 against the bias of the spring 37 and to bring the element 30 into sealing contact with the face 32 of the impeller 20. As indicated above this sealing contact is effected substantially immediately the element 17 is moved to an open position. With the element 17 in its shut position the pump 15 empties and the pressure in passage 43 falls to a value in which the sealing element 30 is lifted from the face 20 by the spring washer 37.Lubricating oil applied to the bearing 21 is retained by the sealing element 31. Between the sealing elements 30, 31 is an annular zone 45 which communicates with a drain passage 46. Lubricant leaking past the sealing element 31 and fuel leaking past the sealing element 30 pass to the drain passage 46 by way of the zone 45. The pump 15 has a delivery pressure of approximately 1150 psi 7.93 x 106 Pa , but the high duty sealing arrangement described above is effective to prevent significant leakage of the pumped fuel and at the same time to prevent undue heating and wear by lifting the element 30 when the pump is not in use. The elements 30, 31 are of tungsten carbide and the surface 32 of the impeller is plasma spray coated with a wear resistance material such as tungsten.In alternative embodiments the pressure applied to the chamber 44 to urge the sealing element 30 into contact with the impeller 20 may be derived either from adjacent the roots of the blades of the impeller 20 or from the pump outlet 16.
