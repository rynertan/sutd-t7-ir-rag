# Optical measurement device.

## Abstract
An output measurement device in which changes in the output wavelength of the light source 7 do not affect the measurement accuracy. Values representing the output wavelength of the light source 7 are supplied by a detector 9 to a signal processing device 5 and used to correct the measurement result for errors otherwise induced by changes in the wavelength of the light source output.
