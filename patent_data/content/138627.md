## Description
ENERGY TRANSFER AGENTS This invention relates to energy transfer agents for nhotochemical reaction systems, especially those used for the solar reduction of water and to processes for the production of hydrogen utilizing such energy transfer agents. The development of solar energy as a major source of energy requires techniques for the conversion of solar radiation into forms of energy that can be efficiently stored and transported. These two requirements can be met in a single operation by the photochemical conversion of solar radiation into high grade chemical fuels A.W. H Mau and W.H.F. Sasse, Proc. Roy. Aust. Chem. Inst., 1977, 44, 89 . Among the most attractive options for the photochemical conversion and storage of solar energy is the photocleavage of water by visible light J.R. Bolton, Science, 1978, 202, 705 . This problem has attracted much attention and today many photochemical systems are known that produce hydrogen from water. In nearly all these systems hydrogen is formed by the interaction of the radical cation of methylviologen 1,1 dimethyl 4,4 bipyridinius dication with hydronium ions H30 and a platinum catalyst. The methylviologen radical cation is produced from methylviologen dication by donation of an electron from an excited species whose energy of excitation has come from sunlight. The species which absorbs the solar radiation and becomes excited the sensitizer can be any one or more coloured compounds which absorb ultraviolet and visible light to form excited states. The sensitizer must also be stable for long periods under the conditions of use. The energy of the excited molecule, its lifetime and its redox properties must be such that the electron transfer agent can be reduced so that it in turn can reduce hydronium ions to hydrogen. One of the best known systems for the photolysis of water employs the tris 2,2 bipyridine ruthenium II dication Ru bpy 32 as sensitizer, methylviologen mv2 as electron transfer agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta as sacrificial electron donor, and platinum on poly vinyl alcohol Pt PVA as electron transfer catalyst hydrogen is formed according to the reactions 1 6 . Ru bpy 32 hv 510 nm Ru bpy 32 , 1 Ru bpy 32 Ru bpy 3 2 2 Ru bpy 2 mv2 Ru bpy 33 mv ., 3 Ru bpy 33 mv . Ru bpy 32 mv2 , 4 Ru bpy 33 edta Ru bpy 32 edta ., 5 2mv 2H Pt 2mv2 H2. 6 The yields of hydrogen vary considerably with experimental conditions and catalyst nevertheless there is now agreement that the initial quantum yield of hydrogen formation, p1 2H2, is 10 i 2 .One factor which contributes to this low level of performance is the relatively low cage escape yield ce of 25 in reaction 3 . ce is a measure of the probability of separation of the ions Ru bpy 33 and mv . per encounter of Ru bpy 32 with mv2 . The efficiency of this bimolecular encounter q varies with the concentration of mv2 but is essentially an inherent property of the ion pair and it cannot be markedly altered by changes in the experimental conditions. Hence substantial improvements in the cage escape yield require the replacement of Ru bpy 32 and or mv by other reagents. Some time ago we reported the effects of certain structural modifications of mv2 on the efficiency of hydrogen production withRu bpy 32 as sensitizer. Although improvements in the production of hydrogen were achieved, they were not caused by increases in the cage escape yields of the quenching step. We have also reported that the anion of 9 anthracenecarboxylic acid AA is much more effective than Ru bpy 32 as sensitizer for the photo reduction of water. Thus hydrogen has been obtained in quantum yields up to 0.93 in accordance with reactions 7 11 and 6 AA hv k 392 nm SAA , 7 SAA TAA, 8 TAA mv2 AA mv , 9 AA mv AA mv2 , 10 AA edta AA edta 11 SAA denotes the singlet ground state of AA denotes the excited Triplet state of AA In the previous report we also referred to differences in the performance of AA and Ru bpy 32 as sensitizer for the photoreduction of water. AA yields more hydrogen because reaction 9 gives more mv than Ru bpy 32 in reaction 3 . The higher efficiency of reaction 9 is related to the longer lifetime of TAA which leads to more efficient bimolecular quenching moreover, the pair AA , mv undergoes cage escape with unit efficiency while the corresponding process with the ruthenium complex yields only n0.25. In the context of solar conversion the stability of the sensitizer and its ability to harvest solar radiation are as important as the yields of hydrogen. In the first two areas Ru bpy 3 2 is superior to We . We realized that the two compounds complement each other as sensitizers for the photoreduction of water and that it was therefore of practical value to combine the favourable attributes of each sensitizer within a single system. The outcome of quenching experiments suggested that it might be possible to combine the high efficiency of TAA in the production of hydrogen with the more favourable light absorption of Ru bpy 32 . Accordingly we examined the production of hydrogen by irradiation of the enlarged system Ru bpy 32 AA mv2 edta Pt PVA under conditions which excluded direct excitation of AA . The results obtained showed that in the presence of even small amounts of AA the hydrogen yield is substantially greater than that obtained by irradiation of the system Ru bpy 32 mv edta Pt PVA. However despite the increased efficiency of hydrogen formation shown by our experiments, the stability of the anthracene carboxylate anion and other water soluble anthracene derivatives is not sufficient for a long lived practical system for the solar photolysis of water on a commercial scale. The excited molecules undergo a variety of side reactions leading to the loss of the anthracene type energy transfer agent and eventual cessation of hydrogen production. Some of these side reactions are photodecarboxylation from the triplet state, photodimerization from the singlet state, and irreversible oxidation. In the case of the anthracene carboxylate anion these can destroy up to 1 of the anion per cycle. A principal object of the present invention is to provide a means for increasing the rate of production of hydrogen and its overall yield in systems of the general type described above. The basis for our present invention resides in our discovery that pyrene derivatives can be used as energy transfer agents in a manner analogous to our previous experiments with anthracene carboxylate but with greatly superior performance and durability. When water soluble pyrene derivatives, e.g. trimethylammonio pyrene salts, are added to the hydrogen producing system described in Equations 1 to 6 , e.g. using tris 2,2 bipyridine ruthenium II dication as sensitizer, methyl viologen as electron transfer agent, edta as sacrificial electron donor and platinum on PVA as electron transfer catalyst, the increased light utilization efficiency and hydrogen production rate noted with anthracene carboxvlate is coupled with a long lifetime for the system components. In particular the lifetime of a system using pyrene derivatives is about 100 times that of an analogous system using anthracene carboxylate. Suitable pyrene derivatives must have some water solubility, have an appropriate redox potential and a long triplet lifetime. Examples of these are compounds with the groups 11R3 tR2H, tRH2, tH3, R NH3 R S03, zwitterions e.g. R2 Cfl2 3 S03, tR2 CH 2 3 CoD , or, t 3 X COO , where R is a C1 C6 alkyl group, R is a C1 C6 alkylene group attached to the pyrene nucleus, and x is a cl C6 alkylene group.EMI5.1 The effect of the energy transfer agents is not restricted to systems using methylviologen per se but is also observable when an energy transfer agent is employed with related electron transfer agents, such as those disclosed by Johansen et al. in Aust. J. Chem 1981 34, 981 991 and launikonis et al. Israel J. Chem, 22 1982 , 158 162. Similarly the effect of the energy transfer agents is not restricted to the use of one sensitizer in isolation e.g. Ru bpy 3 In this way a combination of sensitizers can be used to match the solar spectrum of the sun, the result being a much enhanced rate of hydrogen production. See example Nos. 2 and 3 below . According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a photochemical reaction system which produces hydrogen by reduction of hydronium ions using methylviologen or a related compound as an electron transfer agent and a coloured compound or compounds as sensitiser characterised in that a water soluble pyrene derivative is present in amount sufficient to act as an excitation trap to transfer the energy from the sensitizer to the electron transfer agent with high efficiency. The invention also includes, in another aspect, a process for the production of hydrogen by solar reduction of water, in which hydrogen is produced by the interaction of an electron transfer agent with the hydronium ion and a platinum catalyst, characterised in that the said electron transfer agent is activitated by an energy transfer agent which is a water soluble pyrene derivative and is itself activated by a sensitizer which captures solar radiation. Having broadly portrayed the nature of the present invention, a particular embodiment will now be described by way of example and illustration only. The photochemical system for the production of hydrogen from water using a pyrene derivative Pyrq methylviologen and a platinum catalyst chosen for this illustration depends upon the following set of reactions Ru bpy 32 Sunlight Ru bpy 32 1 Ru bpy 32 Pyrq Ru bpy 32 Tpyr9 lA TpyP mv Pyr .q l mv. 2A Pyr q l edta Pyr9 edta 3A 2mv 2H3O Pt pvao H2 2mv2 2H2O 4 where q denotes the formal charge of the pyrene derivative.where Ru bpy 32 is the tris 2,2 bipyridine ruthenium 1I dication the light absorbing species , mv2 is the 1,1 dimethyl 4,4 bipyridinium dication methylviologen , edta is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and Pyr is the pyrene derivative.Pt pva is a colloidal platinum catalyst supported on polyvinylalcohol.In this model system, the edta acts as a sacrificial electron donor in a commercial facility for the photolysis of water, the electrons will be supplied by a system similar to the above which results in the oxidation of hydroxyl ions to oxygen. In this present system operation should continue until all edta is consumed. Many other photochemical systems depend upon Reaction 4 to produce hydrogen although they use different electron donors and or photosensitizers. The present invention is applicable to all systems using methylviologen and related compounds as electron transfer agents. The following experimental examples illustrate the working of our invention and the benefits obtainable from its use. EXAMPLE 1 The following stock solutions were made up 1. PVA supported platinum catalyst made by forming platinum hydroxide in the presence of dissolved polyvinyl alcohol using the method of Rampino, L.D. and Nord, F.F. J. American Chem. Soc. 1941 63, 2745 . The finished stock solution of 50 ml contained 5 mg of Pt supported by 0.5Z w w of PVA with average molecular weight 125,000. Apparently this catalyst is reduced to the active catalytic species during the induction period which has been observed to occur upon irradiation of the water reduction system.2. 293.2 mg of methylviologen dichloride hydrate made up to 100 ml with pH 5 buffer. This was analysed by spectroscopy and the concentration shown to be 1x10 2 M. 3. 20.2 mg of Ru bpy 3Cl2.5H20 made up to 100 ml with pH 5 buffer.4. 37.2 mg of edta as the disodium salt made up to 100 ml with pH 5 buffer final concentration l M .5. 33.2 mg of trimethylammoniopyrene chloride dihydrate was made up to 50 ml with deionized water final concentration 2x10 3 M .6. 153.7 mg glutathione reduced made up to 100ml with pH 5 buffer final concentration 5xl0 3 . These stock solutions were used to make up a mixture containing the following ingredients at the stated concentration Ru bpy 32 6xlO 5M mv2 1x10 3M edta O.lM Pt PVA 1xl04M Glutathione 5x10 4M This was divided into three. Trimethylanmoniopyrene chloride solution was added to one portion to produce a concentration of 8xlO 4M. Sodium 9 anthracene carboxylate was added to another portion to produce a concentration of 8xlO 4M. No additions were made to the Final portion. These solutions were irradiated using the folLowing procedure. Irradiation procedure The irradiations were carried out in flat bottom pyrex tubes 17 mmO.D., 13 mm I.D., overall length 90 mm with a ground conical joint at the top and a sidearm 30 mm below the top. Argon carrier gas was introduced through an inlet tube 50 mm long fitted into the top of the irradiation tube. A Corning 3 72 filter is used to remove light of 420nm . A 5 ml aliquot of the mixture was irradiated while the carrier gas was passed through the solution and out the sidearm through a bed of Sofnolite Sofnol Ltd., U.K. to absorb C02 produced by photolysis of edta, and then into the sampling valve of a gas chromatograph. Suitable adjustments of dead volume, carrier gas flow rate and frequency of sampling gave both the composition and yield of hydrogen in the gas mixture.The gas chromatograph used a 2 m column of molecular sieve type SA and a catharometer detector to separate and measure the hydrogen. The radiation source was a xenon mercury arc lamp 1 kW, Oriel which delivered, after passing through 10 cm of water in a pyrex dish, a total light flux of about 0.50 W of which 3.5xlO 5 Einstein min was in the range 350 550 nm.Hydrogen Production The yields of hydrogen obtained at various trials of irradiation are given in Table 1.
