## Description
The present invention relates to a polymerization process using compounds having more than one polymerizable acylurethane structure. In general, compounds having an isocyanate group are widely used in the field of polymer chemistry because of their excellent reactivity. Particularly, those having a polymerizable double bond and an isocyanate group in the molecule are expected to have great usefulness, because the double bond and the isocyanate group can respectively participate in various reactions depending upon different reaction mechanisms. Specific examples are vinyl isocyanate Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., 18, 319 1979 , isocyanatoethyl methacrylate Japanese Patent Publn. unexamined No. 5921 79 , acryloyl isocyanate Chem. Ber., 84, 4 1951 and methacryloyl isocyanate Chem. Ber., 84, 4 1951 . The present inventors have been engaged in the research work on acryloyl isocyanate and methacryloyl isocyanate and developed an industrial process for production of them from acrylamide or methacrylamide and oxalyl chloride EP A 0143613 . As a result of the extensive study for development of the industrial application of acryloyl isocyanate and methacryloyl isocyanate, it has been found that the reaction of those isocyanates with hydroxyl group containing compounds can afford acylurethane group containing compounds. The acylurethane group containing compounds still maintain polymerizable double bonds in the acylurethane group, and these polymerizable double bonds are very active so that said acylurethane group containing compounds are readily polymerized under mild conditions. For instance, they can be polymerized with ease at a low temperature even in the absence of any catalyst. As well known, the essential parts of optical fibers to be used for optical transmittance are often made of glass fibers, which are fragile and have inferior elasticity. Thus, the glass fibers are readily broken even by application of a small outer force. In order to prevent the glass fibers from breakage, a resinous material is coated on the outer surfaces of them. Typical examples of such resinous material are epoxy resins and urethane resins. However, the elasticity and toughness provided by those resinous materials are still not satisfactory within a temperature range of 40 to 80 C, at which optical fibers are normally used. In addition, they require a relatively long time for curing, and therefore the processing efficiency is inferior. For overcoming this drawback, some proposals have been made cf. Japanese Patent Publication unexamined Nos. 92553 82 and 223638 83 . As stated above, the acylurethane group containing compounds are curable at such a low temperature as 40 to 80 C with a short period of time by irradiation with high energy rays or in the presence of catalysts. Yet, the cured products show excellent elasticity and toughness. Further, the cured products adhere well to appropriate substrates when applied as coating materials. Acylurethane group containing compounds are suitable as coating materials for, inter alia, optical fibres. GB A 1193601 discloses compounds containing 3 or more substituents of the formula CH₂ CH CO NH CO O , for use as hardening agents for water soluble polymers, especially gelatine. According to the present invention, a polymer is prepared by polymerising the ethylenic double bond, optionally with one or more copolymerisable monomers, of a compound having more than one substituent of the formula It is convenient to consider a compound to be used according to the invention as derived from the corresponding compound having OH groups instead of the said substituents. However, the invention is not restricted to compounds prepared by direct derivation from such a corresponding compound herein often referred to as hydroxyl group containing compound . For production of the acylurethane group containing compound, a corresponding hydroxyl group containing compound may be reacted with an isocyanate compound of the formula wherein R is as defined above. It is characteristic that this reaction can proceed with ease under mild conditions, e.g. at a relatively low temperature in the absence of any catalyst. Alternatively, the acylurethane group containing compound can be produced by reacting a hydroxyl group containing compound with an isocyanate compound of the formula wherein R is as defined above and subjecting the resultant product having a haloalkanoylurethane group of the formula wherein R is as defined above to dehydrohalogenation. This process is disadvantageous in requiring two steps but is still industrially applicable. As the hydroxyl group containing compound, there may be used any one having at least two hydroxyl groups. While no particular limitation is present on the molecular weight of the hydroxyl group containing compound, those having a molecular weight of about 50 to 50,000, especially of about 60 to 20,000, are favorable in easy handling, because they are usually in a liquid state having an appropriate viscosity. For instance, those having a molecular weight of not more than 50,000 can be used by themselves as coating materials without any solvent. In addition, a hydroxyl group containing compound having a molecular weight within said range can give an acylurethane group containing compound which affords a coating film having good physical properties. Specific examples of the hydroxyl group containing compound are as follows In combination with the above exemplified hydroxyl group containing compounds, there are also usable low molecular weight hydroxyl compounds such as alkanols e.g. methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, stearyl alcohol , alkenols e.g. allyl alcohol, crotyl alcohol , aralkanols e.g. benzyl alcohol, phenethyl alcohol , aralkenols e.g. cinnamyl alcohol , phenol, di lower alkylamino lower alkanols e.g., dimethylaminomethanol, dimethylaminoethanol, dimethylaminopropanol, diethylaminoethanol, diethylaminopropanol, N methyl N ethylaminopropanol , di lower alkylaminophenols e.g. o dimethylaminophenol, m dimethylaminophenol, p dimethylaminophenol, m diethylaminophenol , lower alkyl phenylamino lower alkanols e.g. N methyl N phenylaminoethanol, N methyl N phenylaminopropanol , lower alkylphenyl lower alkylamino lower alkanols e.g. N methyl N benzylaminoethanol, N ethyl N benzylaminoethanol, N ethyl N phenethylaminopropanol , N hydroxypyrrolidine, N hydroxypiperidine, N hydroxymorpholine, pyrrolidino lower alkanols e.g. pyrrolidinoethanol, pyrrolidinopropanol , piperidino lower alkanols e.g. piperidinoethanol, piperidinopropanol , morpholino lower alkanols e.g. morpholinoethanol, morpholinopropanol , di lower alkylamino lower alkoxy lower alkanols e.g. dimethylaminoethoxyethanol, dimethylaminoethoxypropanol, diethylaminoethoxypropanol and atropine. As the isocyanate compound I , there may be exemplified acryloyl isocyanate, methacryloyl isocyanate and ethacryloyl isocyanate. Examples of the isocyanate compound II are beta halopropionyl isocyanate, alphamethyl β halopropionyl isocyanates and α ethyl β halopropionyl isocyanates. The reaction between the hydroxyl group containing compound and the isocyanate compound I or II may be conducted in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, at a temperature of 40 to 100 C, preferably 20 to 50 C, and more preferably 0 to 30 C. The use of an inert solvent is usually preferred, in order that the reaction should run smoothly. In general, the hydroxyl group containing compound is used in an equimolar amount or more with respect to the isocyanate compound I or II . Examples of suitable inert solvents are aliphatic hydrocarbons e.g. pentane, hexane, heptane , aromatic hydrocarbons e.g. benzene, toluene, xylene , alicyclic hydrocarbons e.g. cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, naphthalene , petroleum based hydrocarbons e.g. petroleum ether, petroleum benzin , halogenated hydrocarbons e.g. carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,2 dichloroethane , ethers e.g. ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, anisole, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran , ketones e.g. acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, acetophenone, isophorone , esters e.g. ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, 2 ethoxyethyl acetate , acetonitrile, dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide. If an isocyanate compound II is used, the subsequent dehydrohalogenation of the haloalkanoylurethane group containing compound can be conducted in the presence of any hydrogen halide eliminating agent, in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, at a temperature of 40 to 100 C, preferably 20 to 50 C, and more preferably 0 to 30 C. The inert solvent, if used, may be chosen from those as exemplified above. The hydrogen halide eliminating agent which is used may be either a hydrogen halide eliminating agent in the strict sense, i.e. one used theoretically in at least an equimolar amount with respect to the haloalkanoylurethane group containing compound, or a hydrogen halide eliminating catalyst which may be employed in a smaller than equimolar amount. Specific examples of suitable hydrogen halide eliminating agents are amines such as triethylamine, 1,8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undecane 7, pyridine and quinoline, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide, metal oxides such as copper oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, alumina and iron oxide, metal complexes such as Ph₃P ₂Ru CO ₃ and PhP ₃Pt wherein Ph is phenyl , metal halides such as lithium chloride, titanium chloride, aluminium chloride and sodium chloride, metal salts such as zinc naphthenate, nickel acetate, barium sulfate and potassium phosphate, metal alkoxides such as potassium t butoxide, sodium ethoxide and sodium isopropoxide, synthetic zeolites such as molecular sieve and microporous glass, boric acid, oxirane, zinc metal or triphenyl phosphine. Among them, particularly preferred are those chosen from amines, metal oxides, metal halides, synthetic zeolites and triphenyl phosphine. The hydrogen halide eliminating agent is normally employed in an amount of 0.1 to 100 mol, preferably of 0.1 to 10 mol, to 1 mol of the haloalkanoylurethane group containing compound. In the above reactions, it is necessary that at least a portion, preferably 1 10 or more of the hydroxyl groups present in the starting hydroxyl group containing compounds are to be substituted to form an acylurethane group A . Thus, substitution of all the hydroxyl groups is not necessarily required. Recovery of the acylurethane group containing compound from the reaction mixture may be effect by application of a per se conventional separation procedure such as concentration and filtration. In any of the above reactions and the post treatments, a small amount of a polymerization inhibitor may be incorporated into the reaction system or the reaction mixture for prevention of the unnecessary polymerization on the double bond. Examples of the polymerization inhibitor are hydroquinone, p methoxyphenol, 2,6 di t butyl 4 methylphenol, 4 t butylcatechol, bisdihydroxybenzylbenzene, 2,2 methylenebis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , 4,4 thiobis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , p nitrosophenol, diisopropylxanthogensulfide, N nitrosophenylhydroxylamine ammonium salt, 1,1 diphenyl 2 pycrylhydrazil, dithiobenzoylsulfide, p,p ditolyltrisulfide, p,p ditolyltetrasulfide, dibenzyltetrasulfide and tetraethylthiuramsulfide. The acylurethane group containing compounds can be readily polymerized or cured by irradiation with high energy rays e.g. alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays, electron beam, X rays, near ultraviolet rays, ultraviolet rays , especially ultraviolet rays, or in the presence of catalysts such as peroxides. Therefore, the acylurethane group containing compounds or their mixtures with other polymerizable monomers can be used e.g. as coating agents, adhesive agents, fillers and photoresists. The cured products of the acylurethane group containing compounds with or without other polymerizable monomers are characteristic in high elasticity and toughness. When the starting hydroxyl group containing compound has an epoxy group in the molecule, the reaction with the isocyanate compound I or II proceeds usually between the hydroxyl group in the hydroxyl group containing compound and the isocyanate group in the isocyanate compound I or II so that said epoxy group can be retained as such in the reaction product. Such acylurethane group containing compound can be reacted with an amine so that the Michael type addition reaction proceeds with addition of the amine. When a polyamine is used as a curing agent, not only the epoxy group but also the ethylenic unsaturation can be reacted therewith so that the cured product shows a high elasticity due to a large crosslinking density. Further, said acylurethane group containing compound is self crosslinkable by irradiation with high energy rays or in the presence of radical catalysts and also can be subjected to copolymerization with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer so that a graft polymer comprising a carbon carbon bond as the resinous chain is obtainable. Furthermore, said acylurethane group containing compound can be reacted easily with a mercaptan compound whereby radical addition proceeds. Lewis acids such as hydrogen halides can be also added with ease. Moreover, the acylurethane group containing compound can be reacted with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide at the ethylenic unsaturation to make an additional epoxy group. Utilizing those characteristic properties, the acylurethane group containing compound having an epoxy group may be employed in various industrial fields. For instance, it may be cured by the use of a polyamine so that a coating film having a high toughness and a high adhesive strength is obtainable. When irradiated with ultraviolet rays or contacted with a free radical catalyst, self crosslinking proceeds so as to attain curing. When grafted with an acryl resin, various characteristics can be imparted to the resulting product. In addition to the field of coating industry, the acylurethane group containing compound may be used e.g. as an adhesive agent, a molding resin or a resin for electric instruments. A typical application field of the acylurethane group containing compound is the field of coating industry. For such application, the acylurethane group containing compound may be used alone, but it is practically formulated with other polymerizable monomers and additives such as polymerization initiators to give a coating composition comprising the acylurethane group containing compound in an amount of not less than 0.5 by weight. Examples of the other polymerizable monomers are styrene, alpha methylstyrene, vinyltoluene, acrylic esters e.g. methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, dodecyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, allyl acrylate, ethyl diethyleneglycol acrylate , methacrylic esters e.g. methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, dodecyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl methacrylate, ethyl diethylene glycol methacrylate , allylic esters, crotonic esters, maleic esters, vinylpyrrolidone, diacetoneacrylamide, isobutoxymethylacrylamides, acrylamide, N,N dimethylacrylamide, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylic acid, itaconic acid, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, vinyl ethyl ether, vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate. These other polymerizable monomers may be preferred to use in an amount of not more than 50 by weight on the basis of the weight of the composition. Examples of the polymerization initiators are benzoyl peroxide, t butyl peroxybenzoate, acetophenone and benzophenone. The amount of these polymerization initiators may be usually not more than 10 by weight on the basis of the weight of the composition. In addition, the composition may be incorporated with a resinous modifier e.g. epoxy resins, polyamides, polyurethanes, polyethers, polyamide imides, silicon resins, phenol resins , a curing accelerator e.g. cobalt naphthenate, zinc naphthenate, dimethylaniline , an organic silicon compound or a surfactant. For coating glass fibers with the coating composition of the invention, there may be adopted any per se conventional coating process cf. German Offenlegungsschrift 2,459,320, Japanese Patent Publication unexamined No. 139545 78 . Then, ultraviolet rays are irradiated on the coating films provided on the surfaces of the optical fibers for curing. The coating composition curable with high energy rays, particularly usable for coating optical fibers, comprises usually 1 a photocrosslinkable or non crosslinkable polymer or oligomer, 2 a photopolymerizable monomer or low molecular weight oligomer, 3 a photopolymerization initiator or photosensitizer and 4 a heat polymerization inhibitor or stabilizer, optionally with a photosensitizing aid or a coloring agent.
