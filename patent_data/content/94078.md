# Multilayer electrostrictive element which withstands repeated application of pulses.

## Abstract
In a multilayer electrostrictive element wherein electro strictive sections 31 are defined by internal electrodes 32 in a stack having a peripheral surface which has a predetermined outline perpendicularly of an axis of the stack, each internal electrode is given an outline which is approximately congruent with the predetermined outline. In order that external elec trodes 33, 34 may readily be connected to the internal elec trodes grouped into two, each internal electrode may have a peripheral end which is partly recessed from the predeter mined outline. Alternatively, the internal electrodes of each group may be connected together by a conductor rod which passes through the electrostrictive sections. For a great num ber of internal electrodes, an element may be manufactured by laminating conductive paste printed green sheets transverse ly of the stack axis and then sintering the lamination. Each in ternal electrode may include a ceramic material, such as an electrostrictive material of the electrostrictive sections, an other electrostructive material of a lower sintering tempera ture, or glass.
