## Description
This invention relates to a method of designing a logic circuit according to the preamble of claim 1. It is well known that the CMOS technology provides advantages over integrated semiconductor technologies that use only N channel devices, which may be referred to as NMOS devices, or only P channel devices, which may be referred to as PMOS devices. Some of these advantages include speed and virtually no standby power. In static logic designs using only the N channel device technology, complex random logic circuits are either constructed from simple logic blocks or from AND OR arrays which consume direct current power and are often slow and inefficient in the use of semiconductor surface area. A basic logic circuit comprising a matrix having a plurality of circuits of serially arranged P channel devices disposed between a power supply and an output terminal and having a plurality of circuits of serially arranged N channel devices disposed between the output terminal and a point of reference potential, such as ground, is taught in U.S. Patent US A 3,252,011, filed by B. Zuk on March 16, 1964. In U.S. Patent US A 4,069,426, filed by M. Hirasawa on October 5, 1976, there are taught more complex matrices with more parallel circuits having a higher number of devices for handling a variety of functions. Several logic charts, logic circuits and a truth table are disclosed. Furthermore, this patent discloses logic formulas, one of which relates to the P channel circuit and another which relates to the N channel circuit of a matrix. This complementary MOS logic circuit for obtaining second logic signals corresponding to a large number of logic combinations derived from a group of first logic signals, wherein a plurality of series circuits each formed of a plurality of series circuits each formed of a plurality of series connected first channel type IG FET s and a plurality of series each formed of a plurality of series connected second channel type IG FET s are jointly connected to the output terminal of said complementary MOS type logic circuit. This complementary MOS logic circuit with IG FET s does not meet the requirements for making high density circuits which produce any desired Boolean logic function at high speeds with a low power. In Electronic design Volume 15, Number 19, 13 September 1967, pages 81 87 is a nanopower IC logic with complementary MOS arrays described. In this publication is a method described how to design a logic circuit starting with a trues table which determines the logic functions for the performance of which the logic circuits should serve. The proposed circuits of this document do not solve the objective of this invention, particularly each circuit component or its input respectively can not be accessed individually. U.S. Patent US A 3,945,000 filed by Y. Suzuki et al on July 30, 1974, discloses a logic matrix having all P channel devices formed in one area of a chip and all N channel devices formed in another area of the chip. Also, this patent discloses that the P channel devices are arranged according to a logic function of a certain expression, and the N channel devices are arranged according to a logic function of a different expression. U.S. Patent US A 3,643,232, filed by J. S. Kilby on June 5, 1967, describes a semiconductor chip having a plurality of devices preformed within a semiconductor substrate and then selected devices are interconnected with metallic strips to form desired circuits. It is the object of this invention to provide a method of designing a logic circuit which produces any desired Boolean logic function at high speeds with low power and allows automation of logic chip designs from truth tables or logic expressions to the chip layout. The solutions of the object are characterized in claims 1, 4 and 5. In accordance with the teachings of this invention, a method is provided for reducing an arbitrary Boolean logic function or expression to, e.g., static CMOS circuits by the use of a general matrix of P channel devices and N channel devices which are interconnected in accordance with the terms of Boolean logic expressions derived from a truth table. More specifically, a Boolean expression as a sum of products expression is derived from the 1 binary data outputs of a truth table having binary 0 and 1 inputs. This is accomplished by complementing, or barring, in the expression the inputs or literals which are a binary 1 when the output is 1 and leaving true or unbarred the inputs or literals that are a binary 0. Then each input of a given product term in the expression is applied as a voltage to the gate electrode of a P channel device, which devices are connected in series with one end tied to a source of potential and the other end of the series circuit connected to an output terminal. Each product term is arranged in parallel with other P channel device series circuits to form one half of a complete logic matrix circuit. Similarly, for the other half of the matrix, a sum of products expression giving the binary 0 outputs of a truth table having binary 1 s or 0 s for an input is found. Each input of a given product term is applied as a voltage to the control gate of an N channel device, which devices are connected in series with one end tied to a potential reference point, such as ground, and the other end of the series circuit is connected to the output terminal. Each product term is arranged in parallel with other N channel device series circuits to form the other half of the logic matrix. Each of the two halves of the matrix can be minimized by factoring out the common literals in the sum of product expressions. Redundant P and N channel devices are eliminated and common nodes are tied together. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following and more particular description of the preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Referring to the drawings in more detail, there is illustrated in Fig. 1 a basic schematic diagram within which the circuits produced by the present invention may be formed. The diagram includes a first switch 10, made of one or more PMOS devices, connected between a source of potential V Fig. 2 illustrates a convenient arrangement of P channel devices or field effect transistors, each being identified by P, which may be used to form the PMOS switch or network 10 shown in Fig. 1. A similar arrangement of N channel devices or field effect transistors, each being identified by N, which may be used to form the NMOS switch or network 12 is also shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 3 illustrates an arbitrary logic truth table having four input signals or literals A, B, C and D and an indication of the output signal Q, a binary 1 or 0, arranged in four rows and four columns, for the various combinations of inputs of the four literals A, B, C and D. The Boolean expression for this truth table may be found to be In accordance with the teachings of this invention, from a truth table, such as the table of Fig. 3, a Boolean logic expression Q By using known algebraic theorems and by factoring out the common inputs in the sum of product expression, Having derived this Boolean expression, a voltage representative of each input of a given product term of the expression is applied to the gate electrode of a P channel device P in the PMOS switch or network 10 which are connected in series with one end tied to the source of potential V By referring to Fig. 4 of the drawings, it can be seen that the inputs Further in accordance with the teachings of this invention, from the truth table in Fig. 3, a Boolean logic expression Q By using known theorems and by factoring out the common inputs in the sum of product expression, With this Boolean expression Q By again referring to Fig. 4 of the drawings, it can be seen that the inputs Although the circuit of Fig. 4 was formed from expressions Q In Fig. 5, there is illustrated a layout or topological view of a portion of a semiconductor chip or wafer 46 in which the circuit of Fig. 4 is fabricated. The chip 46 includes a substrate 48 which may be made of P conductivity type silicon. An N well 50 is formed in the substrate 48 by, e.g., diffusion or implantation of arsenic. A first thin layer of silicon dioxide 52 is grown or deposited over the N well 50 and a second thin layer of silicon dioxide 54 is grown or deposited over substrate 48 outside of the N well 50 but adjacent thereto. A thick oxide layer 56 is grown or deposited by any known technique over the substrate 48 outside of the thin silicon dioxide layers 52 and 54. A plurality of parallely arranged conductive strips 58, preferably made of doped polysilicon, are formed over the insulating layers 52, 54 and 56. Under the first thin silicon dioxide layer 52 and adjacent to each side of each strip 58 is a source drain P conductivity type region 60 which may be made by implanting boron into N well 50 with the strips 58 acting as a shield for defining the channel regions of the PMOS devices or transistors, each of which includes two adjacent source drain regions 60 separated by one of the strips 58 disposed over the transistor s channel region. Under the second thin silicon dioxide layer 54 and adjacent to each side of each strip 58 is a source drain N conductivity type region 62 which may be made by implanting arsenic into the substrate 48 with the strips 58 acting as a shield for defining the channel regions of the NMOS devices or transistors, each of which includes two adjacent source drain regions 62 separated by one of the strips 58 disposed over the transistor s channel region. A bus V It can be seen that the structure of Fig. 5 forms a very compact CMOS logic circuit which is readily expandible and which adheres to an automated logic methodology. It is apparent that a finite matrix can be used as a program logic array which is programmable at the mask level. This implementation may be used for any CMOS technology. It should be understood that this methodology for rapidly preparing logic circuits from truth tables is valid for any random logic function and also for common logic building blocks such as NOR, NAND, AOI, XOR and multiplexers. The stacking of devices is limited only by performance. For several levels, the output may be buffered and amplified, if desired. The speed of operation of this circuit is enhanced by the processing of the input data in parallel and by its compactness. Static DC power is not dissipated at any time. It should also be understood that the methodology described hereinabove in connection with static CMOS circuits also applies to static and dynamic NMOS circuits and to dynamic CMOS circuits. For static NMOS circuits, the P channel array or PMOS switch 10 is replaced by, e.g., a single N channel load device or transistor. Stacking is limited in this case due to ratioed constraints. Dynamic NMOS and CMOS circuits replace the P channel array 10 with pulsed or clocked load devices of either N or P channel type. Such arrays, however, are leakage and noise sensitive, and must be operated synchronously. The matrix 10 of Fig. 4 provides amplification, a full supply voltage being available at the output terminal Q. Additional amplification may be provided in the matrix if desired, to further improve speed.
