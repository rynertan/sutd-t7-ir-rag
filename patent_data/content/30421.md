# Glass spinning vessel.

## Abstract
To ensure an adequate mixing of fresh melted glass with the molten glass already in the vessel of a glass spinning de vice, there is provided a vessel having at least one glass inlet 8 laterally offset from the position of the draw bar and located above a first reception trough 11 separated by a first weir 12 from a second reception trough 13 itself separated from the main body of the glass in the vessel by a second weir 14 . It has hitherto been customary, in order to get the neces sary mechanical strength and wear resistance at the tempera tures involved, to use draw bars and nipples 25 of platinum. By embedding in the plate 21 a substantial portion of the length of the nipples 25 , the onset of cooling can be delayed so that the temperature of the glass entering the nipple 25 can be at a lower level. This enables the use of temperature re sistant alloys such as nickel chromium alloys in place of plati num to be acceptable.
