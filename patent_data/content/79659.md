# Inductive device.

## Abstract
The device comprises a winding support 1 with a base which comprises connection points and on the upper side of which there is provided a centring member 19 whose exterior defines a cylindrical or conical surface which is coaxial with the cylindrical central portion 15 of a coil core 15, 19 . The winding 13 is provided about the central portion. The coil core furthermore comprises a non rotationally symmetrical upper flange portion 17 which cooperates with a ferromagnetic adjusting core 25 which is formed by a cap which is arranged over the coil core and whose portion which faces the base corresponds internally as regards shape and radial dimensions to the cylindrical or conical surface defined by the centring member. This portion encloses the centring member with a suitable fit, so that the adjusting core is rotatable about the axis of the coil core. The portion of the adjusting core 25 which is situated near the upper flange portion 17 of the coil core 15, 17 is also non rotationally symmetrical.
