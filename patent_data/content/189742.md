# Device for transmitting signals and or data.

## Abstract
Device for transmitting signals and or data between a measuring device 1 and a transducer 2 , the two being mechanically connected with each other and the transducer being movable, for example rotatable, relative to a test object 3 , comprising a rotatable body 5 journalled in a bearing 14 in or on a base 15 , one transducer 2 eccentrically journalled 8 in the rotatable body 5 , a mechanical connection link 13 , for example a hollow pendulum arm, arranged between the base 15 and the transducer 2 , a coupling 11 , via which said mechanical connection link 13 is connected to the base 15 while the centre 7 of said link is located at the centre axis 6 of the rotatable body, a coupling 12 via which said mechanical connection link 13 is connected to the transducer 2 , and a conductor 4 between the measuring device 1 and the transducer 2 disposed through or near the couplings 11, 12 . According to the invention said two couplings consist of flexible couplings for transmitting a rotary motion and or a torsional moment, for example hollow flexible bearings which are blocked or locked by means of driver or carrier pins 10 to prevent the transducer 2 from rotating to any major extent relative to the base 15 , thus preventing the conductor conductors 4 from being damaged by twisting.
