# High speed photodiodes.

## Abstract
A high speed planar photodiode having a bandwidth in excess of 50 GHz is fabricated on gallium arsenide and includes a Schottky diode having an optically transparent metal barrier 11 or a heterojunction diode having an opti cally transparent heterojunction region. The diode is sur rounded by a nonconducting region 21 to minimise fringing fields and beam leads may be provided to minimise lead inductance. A high speed MESFET phototransistor using the planar photodiode is also disclosed.
