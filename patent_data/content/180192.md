## Description
This invention relates to a novel plasmid containing a DNA fragment comprising genes which govern the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase. More specifically, it relates to a plasmid containing a DNA fragment comprising genes which govern the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase, for example tryptophan operon or a DNA fragment at least comprising trp A and trp B and a DNA fragment having a promoter function of expressing trp A and trp B. The novel plasmid has a large copy number and excellent stability in host cells, and in cell proliferation, is exactly partitioned between daughter cells without deletion. Extensive reasearch has been done heretofore on the cloning of DNA fragments containing genes which govern the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase. However, such DNA fragments have unsatisfactory stability in host cells as described, for example in Journal of GeneralMicrobiology, Vol. 118, 253 1980 , and their application to industrial production of tryptophan is considered to encounter many difficulties. On the other hand, the most important problem in practice in the stability of a plasmid in host cells is generally the phenomenon of deletion of the plasmid in the subcultivation of the host cells. Various attempts have therefore been made to prevent deletion of plasmids.For example, a method for stabilizing the properties of a microorganism containing a plasmid was proposed in which a plasmid having inserted thereinto a DNA fragment containing a chromosomal gene which governs the property of a microorganism of the genus Escherichia to be independent on streptomycin is included into a streptomycin dependent mutant of the genus Escherichia U. S. Patent No.4,371,615 . This method, however, is economically disadvantageous. Moreover, since complex functions need to be incorporated in the desired plasmid, it. is anticipated that the plasmid will not easily be partitioned stably between daughter cells during proliferation of the host.Industrial application of this method would be considerably difficult. With the foregoing background, the present inventors extensively worked for a plasmid having the function of stably partitioning a DNA fragment containing genes governing the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase, such as tryptophan operon, in a parent cell between daughter cells in subcultivation, and noticed that a DNA fragment containing genes which govern the partition system of F plasmid contributes greatly to the stabilization of plasmids. On this basis, the present inventors previously created and proposed a novel plasmid, named plasmid pMTY lw by the inventors, which comprises a DNA fragment containing genes governing the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase and a DNA fragment containing genes governing the partition system of the F plasmid JapaneseLaid Open Patent Publication No. 2189 1985 .This new plasmid pMTY l is useful for expressing a gene unstable in host cells, but has the disadvantage that its copy number is as small as 1 to 2, and it has a low efficiency in obtaining large amounts of the product of the gene within the cells. It has been desired therefore to develop a plasmid which has a large copy number and a high expression efficiency, is stable, and is exactly partitioned between daughter cells in subcultivation with little deletion in the cells of a transformed microorganism. The present inventors have noted that a ColEl type plasmid of E. coli usually has a copy number of several tens per chromosome, and have succeeded in creating a plasmid which has a large copy number and can be stably partitioned in subcultiavtion by combining a DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from the ColEl type plasmid and govern its autonomous replication, a DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from theF plasmid and govern its partition system and a DNA fragment containing genes which govern the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase. According to this invention, there is provided a novel plasmid which can be autonomously replicated within the cells of Escherichia coli, said plasmid comprising a DNA fragment containing genes which govern the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase, a DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from F plasmid and govern its partition system and a DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from a Col El type plasmid and govern its autonomous replication. The DNA fragment containing genes which govern the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase to be sometimes abbreviated as T fragment constituting the plasmid of the invention denotes a DNA fragment containing genes which govern the biosynthesis of L tryptophan from indole and L or DL serine. The T fragment includes, for example, tryptophan operon, a larger DNA fragment containing tryptophan operon, a DNA fragment containing trp A and trp B, which are genes included within tryptophan operon, and governing the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase, and a promoter and an operator joined thereto, and a DNA fragment containing trp A and trp B and at least one of trp C, trp D and trp E, and a promoter and an operator jointed thereto for example a DNA fragment containing trp A, trp B, trp C, trp E, a promoter and an operator . If a microorganism transformed with the plasmid of this invention is used, the production of tryptophan by a so called fermentation method becomes economically feasible. In the production of tryptophan from indole and L serine in actual operation, DL serine may be added to the reaction system instead of L serine because onlyL serine reacts selectively as materials by utilizing only the tryptophan synthase action derived from tryptophan operon, the efficiency of biosynthesis of tryptophan decreases because tryptophan operon as the T fragment has the function of jointly producing three other enzymes in addition to tryptophan synthase. In order to increase the efficiency of biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase in tryptophan operon, the present inventors extensively worked on a plasmid which meets this purpose. Consequently, the present inventors have found that a plasmid comprising a combination of a DNA fragment which is obtained by ligating a DNA fragment having a promoter function of expressing trp A and trp B and optionally a DNA fragment having an operator function of controlling the promoter function to trp A and trp B fragments which are genes governing biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase, a DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from the F plasmid and govern its partition system and a DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from the Col El type plasmid and govern its autonomous replication markedly increases the efficiency of producing tryptophan synthase. Accordingly, the T fragment used in this invention is preferably a DNA fragment obtained by ligating aDNA fragment having a promoter function of expressing trpA and trp B to be sometimes referred to as tryptophan promoter and as required, a DNA fragment having an operator function of controlling the promoter function to be sometimes referred to as tryptophan operator to trp A and trp B fragments. In practice, the T fragment is preferably that derived from E. coli. There is no particular restriction on the source of the T fragment, but E. coli ATCC 23282, E. coli ATCC 23437 and E. coliATCC 23461 can be advantageously used. A detailed method of preparing the T fragment suitable for the purpose of this invention from these bacteria, for example a tryptophan operon or a DNA frag ment composed of trp A and trp B fragments, a tryptophan promoter and a tryptophan operator is shown in Example 1, C and Example 3, B given hereinbelow. The basic procedure comprises infecting phage B 80 with an E.coli strain having tryptophan operon in its chromosomal genes, and then inducing the phage to prepare a large amount of the phage having tryptophan operon incorporated in the phage DNA. Then, the phage DNA is extracted and a tryptophan operon DNA fragment is cut out from it by using restriction endonucleases BamHI, EcoRI, etc. As required, this DNA fragment is further partially cleaved with restriction endonuclease HincII to obtain a DNA fragment containing trp A and trp B genes. A DNA fragment containing a promoter and an operator can be obtained by treating the tryptophan operon DNA fragment with restriction endonuclease PvuII. The resulting twoDNA fragments are ligated by using a DNA ligase to prepare a DNA fragment composed of trp A and trp B fragments and the tryptophan promoter and the tryptophan operator joined thereto. One characteristic feature of this invention is that as described hereinabove, the T fragment is combined with the DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from F plasmid and govern its partition system. TheF plasmid is a known plasmid having a molecular size of 94.5 Kb 62 x 106 daltons having the structure shown in the genetic map and the physical map by EcoRI shown at page 64 of R. A. Skurray, H. Nagaishi and A. J. Clark Proc. Natl. Acad. SCi., U.S.A., Vol. 73, page 64 1976 .The F factor plasmid exists in enteric bacteria such as coli usually in a copy number of 1 to 2 per cell chromosome. This plasm id has a mechanism whereby it is accurately transmitted to daughter cells after cell division the proliferation accurately in accord with the pace of proliferation of a host in spite of a low copy number level as in this case is called the stringent control of proliferation . It has already been found that such a function of stringently controlling proliferation in the F plasmid is carried on a fragment, called mini F, which has a molecular size of 9.1 Kb and can replicate autonomously. It is also known that the mini F can be cut out from the F plasmid by restriction endonuclease EcoRI The present invention utilizes the partition system of the mini F.Thus, the DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from the F plasmid and govern its partition system to be sometimes abbreviated as the F fragment denotes a DNA fragment having a mechanism of accurately transmitting the F plasmid to daughter cells .A typical example of such F fragment is a mini F fragment having a molecular size of about 9.1 Kb. The DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from a Col El type plasmid and which govern its autonomous replication to be sometimes abbreviated as S fragment to be used in combination with the T and F fragments in this invention denotes a DNA fragment which has a copy number of 20 to 30 per cell chromosome and contains genes governing the autonomous replication of the Col El type plasmid. A typical example of the S fragment is an S fragment derived from the plasmid pBR322 and having a size of about 4.3 Kb. The plasmid provided by this invention comprises the T fragment, F fragment and S fragment as essential constituents, and may further include DNA fragments bearing other genetic information, for example a DNA fragment containing an ampicillin resistance gene which is an antibiotic resistance marker, and a DNA fragment containing a kanamycin resistance gene One typical example of the plasmid provided by this invention is a plasmid, named plasmid pMTY 2 by the present invenotrs, which consists essentially of the T fragment tryptophan operon DNA fragment , the F fragment mini F fragment and the S fragment and having a molecular size of about 13.7 megadaltons about 20.8 Kb . In the present application, the molecular sizes of plasmids are determined by the agarose gel electrophoretic method. The plasmid pMTY 2 will be described in detail. The sensitivities the number of recognition or cleavage sites of the plasmid pMTY 2 to the following restriction endonucleases, and the lengths Kb of fragments cleaved with these restriction endonucleases are tabulated below.

First, the tryptophan operon DNA fragment T fragment is prepared by, for example, infecting a phage, such as phage B 80 ATCC 11456all with E. coli having tryptophan operon in its chromosomal gene, such asEscherichia coli K 12 IFO 3301, ATCC 10798, or ATCC e23562 , lyzing and inducing the phage to prepare a large amount of a phage having tryptophan operon incorporated in the phage DNA see R. M. Denney, C. Yanof sky J.Bacteriol., 118, 505 1974 1, extracting the phage DNA from it 1T. Maniatis, E. F. Fritsch, J. Sambrook Molecu lar Cloning 1982 , pages 164 165, Cold Spring HarborLaboratory , and cutting out the tryptophan operon from the extracted phage DNA using a restriction endonuclease such as BamHI or EcoRI. The mini F fragment may be prepared, for example, by extracting the F plasmid from a microorganism harboring the F plasmid, such as E. coli K 12 ATCC 15153, ATCC e23589, or ATCC e23590 , by a method known per se , for example by the method described in P. Guerry,D. L. LeBlanc, S. Falkow J. Bacteriol, 116, 1064 1973 , and cutting out a mini F fragment having a molecular size of about 9.1 Kb from the F plasmid using restriction endonuclease EcoRI. It is convenient to use plasmid pBR322 which is a typical example of the Col El plasmid as a source of the fragment containing genes governing the autonomous replication of the Col El plasmid. The tryptophan operon DNA fragment T fragment prepared as above and plasmid PBR322 treated with the same restriction endonuclease as that used in cutting out the T fragment were ligated by means of a ligase such as ligase derived from T4 phage to prepare a plasmid having the T fragment inserted into the plasmid pBR322. The resulting plasmid is then cleaved with restriction endonuclease EcoRI, and ligated with the mini F fragment prepared as above by the action of a ligase. As a result, the desired plasmid pMTY 2 is obtained. The preparation of the plasmid pMTY 2 is more specifically described in Example 1 below. The plasmid pMTY 2 of this invention so prepared has a large copy number, is stable and is not deleted when partitioned between daughter cells during the cell division of the host. Another typical example of the plasmid provided by this invention is a plasmid, named plasmid pMTY 3 by the present inventors, which consists essentially of the T fragment trpA trp B tryptophan promoter tryptophan operator , the F fragment mini F fragment and theS fragment and has a molecular size of about 9.0 megadaltons about 13.6 Kb . The plasmid pMTY 3 will be described in detail below. The sensitivities the number of recognition sites of the plasmid pMTY 3 to the following restriction endonucleases, and the lengths Kb of fragments cleaved with these restriction endonucleases are tabulated below.

First, the T fragment consisting of trp A, trpB, tryptophan promoter and tryptophan operator is prepared as follows A phage, such as phage 8 80 ATCC 11456a Bl , is infected with E. coli having tryptophan operon in chromosomal genes, such as E. coli K 12 IFO 3301, ATCC 10798 or ATCC e23562 , and lyzing and inducing the phage to prepare a large quantity of a phage having tryptophan operon incorporated in the phage DNA Lsee R.M. Denney, C. Yanofsky J. Bacteriol., 118, 505 1974 1, and extracting the phage DNA from it see T. Maniatis, E.F. Fritsch, and J. Sambrook Molecular Cloning 1982 , pages 164 165, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , cutting out a tryptophan operon DNA fragment from it using a restriction endonuclease such as BamHI and EcoRI, and further partially cleaving the DNA fraction with restriction enzyme HincII to obtain a DNA fragment containing trp A and trp B genes. Treatment of the tryptophan operon DNA fragment with restriction endonucleasePvuII gives a DNA fragment containing a promoter and an operator. The resulting two DNA fragments are ligated using T4 DNA ligase derived from T4 phage. As a result, a T fragment is obtained in which the DNA fragment containing the promoter and the operator is ligated with trpA and trp B fragments and which contains an EcoRI site at both terminals. The mini F fragment may be prepared, for example, by extracting the F plasmid from a microorganism harboring the F plasmid, such as E. coli K 12 ATCC 15153, ATCC e23589, or ATCC e23590 , by a method known èr se , for example by the method described in P. Guerry,D. L. LeBlanc, S. Falkow J. Bacteriol, 116, 1064 1973 , and cutting out a mini F fragment having a molecular size of about 9.1 Kb from the F plasmid using restriction endonuclease EcoRI. As a source of the fragment containing genes governing the autonomous replication of the Col El plasmid, it is convenient to use plasmid pBR322 which is a typical example of Col El plasmid. The mini F fragment prepared as above is treated with restriction endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI is ligated by means of T4 DNA ligase with plasmid pBR322 treated with the same restriction endonucleases to construct a plasmid having the mini F fragment inserted into plasmid pBR322. The resulting recombinant plasmid is cleaved with EcQRI, and ligated with the T fragment prepared as above by the action of T4 DNA ligase to thereby obtain the desired plasmid pMTY 3. The preparation of the plasmid pMTY 3 will be more specifically described in Example 3 given hereinbelow. The plasmid pMTY 3 of this invention so prepared has a large copy number, is stable and is not deleted when partitioned between daughter cells during the cell division of the host. Still another typical example of the plasmid provided by this invention is a plasmid, named plasmid pMTY 8 by the present inventors, which consists substantially of the T fragment, F fragment and S fragment and has a molecular size of about 9.0 megadaltons about 13.6Kb , wherein a the T fragment consists at least of trp A, trp B, a tryptophan promoter and a tryptophan operator, b the F fragment is a mini F fragment, c the S fragment is derived from plasmid pBR322, i the direction of transcription from the promoter in the DNA fragment containing genes governing the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase, the direction of replication from the replication initiation point of the mini F fragment, and the direction of replication from the replication initiation point of the DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from Col El type plasmid and govern its autonomous replication are identical, and ii the DNA fragment containing genes governing the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase is located upstream of the DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from the Col El type plasmid and govern its autonomous replication. The plasmid pMTY 8 will be described in detail below. The sensitivities the number of recognition sites of the plasmid pMTY 8 to the following restriction endonucleases, and the lengths Kb of fragments cleaved with these restriction endonucleases are tabulated below. Number of Length of Restriction recognition the endonuclease sites fragment CKb EcoRI 2 10.7, 2.9 BamHI 2 9.7, 3.9 SalI 3 10.6, 2.9, 0.1 PstI 5 5.9, 4.0, 1.8, 1.5, 0.4 AvaI 1 13.6 The plasmid pMTY 8 having the above characteristics can be produced, for example, by the following procedure. A detailed method for preparing plasmid pMTY8 is shown in Example 6 given hereinbelow. The basic procedure is as follows A DNA fragment containing genes governing the biosynthesis of tryptophan synthase is cut out from pMTY 3 using restriction endonuclease EcoRI.pMTY 3 is deposited as introduced into E. coli K12 YK2009 Deposit No. FERMP 7957 and can be extracted from the cultivated cells see T. Maniatis, E. F. Fritsch and J.Sambrook Molecular Cloning 1982 , pages 86 94 . TheDNA fragment so cut out was re ligated using T4 DNA ligase derived from T4 phage. As a result, the plasmid pMTY 8 is constructed in a proportion of about 10 based on the plasmid pMTY 3. The plasmid pMTY 8 of this invention so prepared, like the plasmid pMTY 3, has a large copy number, is stable and is not deleted when prtitioned between daughter cells during the cell fission of the host. The plasmids of this invention are much expected to be applicable to the industrial production of trypto phan. In the production of tryptophan, a host organism is transformed with the plasmid of the invention.Possible candidates for such a host organism include E.coli, B. subtilis and Saccharomyces strains. Microorganisms of the genus EsQherMhia, particularly microorganisms of the E. coli K 12 type, are preferred. Of these, strains having no activity of decomposing Ltryptophan i.e., tryptophanase deficient mutants , are especially preferred. The plasmid of this invention can be introduced into the host organism by a method known per se, for example the method described in M. Mandel and A. Higa J.Mol. Biol. 53, 159 1970 . The host organism so transformed is cultivated by a method known per se to produce and accumulate tryptophan synthase fully within the cells, and then can be utilized in an enzymaic reaction for the production ofL tryptophan from indole and L or DL serine. The cultivation of the transformed host organism can be carried out by a method known Eher se. Culture media that can be used may include any natural and synthetic media containing carbon sources, nitrogen sources and inorganic salts which are used in ordinary microorganism cultivation. Examples of the carbon sources are various carbohydrates such as glucose, glycerol, fructose, sucrose and molasses. Examples of the nitrogen sources are natural organic nitrogen sources such as tryptone, yeast extract, corn steep liquor and casein hydrolyzate. Many of the natural organic nitrogen sources can also serve as carbon sources. Examples of the inorganic salts include potassium monohydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, ferrous sulfate, calcium chloride and manganese chloride. Other nutrients such as vitamins and amino acids useful for the growth of microorganisms may be added to the culture media. Furthermore, indoleacrylic acid or its salt may be addd to the culture media. This addition has been found to markedly increase the amount of tryptophan synthase produced. Indoleacrylic acid or its salt may be added in the initial stage of cultivation or during the cultivation. In the latter case, it is desirable to add it at the latest before the final stage of the logarithmic growth period of the microorganism. The addition may be performed once or several times, or continuously. The amount of indoleacrylic aid or its salt added is not strictly limited. Generally, it may be added in such an amount that the final concentration of it based on the culture medium is at least 25 micrograms ml, preferably 80 to 100 micrograms ml, more preferably 100 to 200 micrograms ml. The salt of indoleacrylic acid may be an alkali metal indoleacrylate such as sodium indoleacrylate. The final concentration , as used herein, denotes the total concentration of indoleacrylic acid or its salt added to the culture medium until the end of the cultivation. In the process of this invention, it is desirable to use glucose as at least part of the carbon source.The amount of glucose used is generally 10 to 600 moles, preferably 50 to 400 moles, more preferably 100 to 300 moles, per mole of indoleacrylic acid or its salt. The cultivation time varies depending upon the type of the microorganism, the other cultivation conditions, etc. Usually, it is about 1 to about 120 hours.The cultivation temperature is usually about 20 to about 50 C, and the pH of the culture medium is generally 5 to 9, preferably about 6 to about 8. The cultivation is preferably carried out under aerobic conditions by shaking, or by aeration and agitation. The microorganism cells so cultivated may be directly utilized in the enzymatic reaction of producingL tryptophan. They may, however, be used in the form of a crushed product obtained by crushing the cells by, for example, ultrasonication, an extract obtained by extracting the crushed product with water or the like, or a partially purified product obtained by treating the extract with ammonium sulfate, etc. to precipitate the enzyme component. As required, the cells and their treated products may be immobilized prior to use. The reaction of indole with L or DL serine in the presence of the above cells or their treated product is carried out, as in an ordinary enzymatic reaction, in a solvent such as 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 9.0 or water pH 7.0 9.0 at a temperature of about 20 to about 50 C, preferably about 30 to about 40OC, usually for a period of about 0.1 to about 72 hours. The amounts of indole and L or DL serine used at the time of the reaction are not particularly restricted. Generally, these materials are suitably used each in a concentration of 0.01 to 20 wt vol . The amount of the cells or the treated product thereof used are neither restricted in particular, and may generally be 0.1 to 10 wt vol . After the reaction, L tryptophan may be separated from the reaction mixture and purified by methods known per se, for example adsorption and desorption using an ion exchange resin or activated carbon. The enzymatic process described above is very advantageous industrially because it can markedly increases the rate of production of tryptophan in the production of L tryptophan by reacting indole and L orDL serine in the presence of the cultivated cells of a microorganism of the genus Escherichia transformed with the plasmid provided by this invention, for example the plasmid pMTY 2, pMTY 3 or pMTY 8, or a product obtained by treating the microbial cells. The host organism transformed with the plasmid of this invention may also be utilized in the production of L tryptophan by a fermentation method. Specifically, when the transformed host is cultivated, L tryptophan is produced and accumulated in the culture medium and can be recovered from the culture broth. The cultivation can be carried out by using the same medium as described above under the same conditions as described above. In the fermentation method, indole or anthranilic acid or its salt the salt may be the same as exemplified above with regard to the salt of indoleacrylic acid may, as required, be added to the culture medium as a precursor of L tryptophan. In the case of cultivating E. coli K 12 YK2004 transformed with the plasmid pMTY 2, it is prefered to add indole or anthranilic acid or its salt. In the case of E. coli K 12YK2009 transformed with pMTY 3 or E. coli K 12 YK2014 transformed with pMTY 8, the addition of indole is preferred. The addition may be effected in the initial stage of the cultivation or during the cultivation as in the case of adding indoleacrylic acid or its salt.When the addition is effected during the cultivation, it should desirably be done at the latest before the final stage of the logarithmic growth period of the microorganism. The addition may be carried out once or a plurality of times or continuously. The amount of indole or anthranilic acid or its salt is not strictly limited.For example, when glucose is used as the carbon source, the amount of indole or anthranilic acid or its salt is 0.005 to 1 mole, preferably 0.01 to 0.5 mole per mole of glucose. L Tryptophan may be recovered from the culture broth obtained by cultivation under the above cultivation conditions by methods known er se, for example by adsorption desorption treatment using an ion exchange resin, activated carbon, etc. The process of the invention described above can give L tryptophan very efficiently, and is very advantageous industrially. A plasmid containing the DNA fragment containing genes governing the partition system of the F plasmid such as the mini F fragment , the DNA fragment containing genes which are derived from Col El plasmid such as pBR322 and govern its autonomous replication, and a promoter capable of expressing a foreign gene such as a promoter derived from tryptophan operon , and preferably further containing an operator can be used as a vector.An example of the foreign gene used is a structural gene corresponding to tryptophan synthase. The following Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically. EXAMPLE 1 Construction of plasmid pMTY 2 A Preparation of a mini F fragment E. coli K 12 strain ATCC 15153 was inoculated in one liter of L medium Bacto tryptone 10 g, yeast extract 5 g, NaCl 5 g, glucose 1 g, water 1 liter pH 0 7.2 , and cultivated with shaking at about 37 C for 4 hours. The cells were harvested, treated with lysozyme, and lyzed with sodium dodecylsulfate SDS . The lysate was centrifuged for 40 minutes at 32,000 x G. The supernatant was separated, subjected to cesium chlorideethidium bromide equilibrium density gradient centrifugation and then dialyzed to separate a solution containing the F plasmid. The solution was precipitated with ethanol to finally collect about 20 micrograms of the F plasmid. Then, 5 micrograms of the F plasmid was taken and subjected to the action of restriction endonucleaseEcoRI for 1 hour at 37 0C to cleave the DNA. As a result, a DNA solution containing a mini F fragment having a size of about 9.1 Kb was prepared. B Preparation of phage B 80pt E. coli K 12 strain IFO 3301 was inoculated in 100 ml of L medium having the same composition as indicated above , and cultivated with shaking at370C for 4 hours. 0.5 mg of the culture broth was mixed with 0.1 ml of an aqueous solution of phage 8 80 ATCC 11456a B1 1O ml in L medium soft agar L medium agar powder , and the mixture was overlaid on an L medium agar plate. When the plate was cultivated at 37 0C for about 5 hours, a plaque formed. When the cultivation was continued further for 2 to 3 days at 37 C, grown colonies of phage 80 lysogenic bacteria formed in the plaque.The lysogenic bacteria were cultivated in L medium at 0 37 C for 4 hours and plated on the same L medium agar plate as above, and then by the induction of the lysogenic phage by ultraviolet radiation 400 800 ergs mm2, 10 20 seconds , phage 8 80 pt a phage DNA containing tryptophan operon was prepared. C Preparation of a tryptophan operon DNA fragment coli K 12 strain IFO 3301 was inoculated in 1 liter of L medium having the same composition as indicated above, and cultivated with shaking at about 37 0C for about 3 hours. In the logarithmic growth period, 10 ml of a 25 w v glucose solution and the phage 8 80 pt solution prepared in B were added moi 20 in a concentration of 1011 my, The shaking culture was continued for 5 hours, and by the addition of chloroform, a large amount of phage 8 80 pt was prepared seeT. Maniatis, E. F. Fritsch, J. Sambrook MolecularCloning 1982 , pages 76 80, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory .

The phage DNA was reacted with restriction endonuclease BamHI at 30 OC for 30 minutes to obtain a tryptophan operon DNA fragment. D Construction of plasmid pMTY 2 The tryptophan operon DNA fragment obtained in C was digested with restriction endonucleases SalI and 0XhoI at 37 C for 1 hour. The digestion product was then heat treated at 65 OC for 5 minutes to inactivate the restriction endonucleases, and mixed with plasmid pBR322 treated similarly with restriction endonucleaseSalI. ATP adenosine triphosphate and DTT dithiothreitol were added, and thereafter, DNA ligase derived fromT4 phage T4 DNA ligase produced by Takara Shuzo Co., 0Ltd. was added.

The transformants were subjected to liquid cultivation, and a plasmid containing tryptophan operon was isolated from the culture broth. The plasmid containing tryptophan operon was reacted with restriction endonuclease EcoRI at 37 0C for 0 1 hour, and then heat treated at 65 C for 5 minutes to inactivate EcoRI. The mini F fragment obtained in a above was then added, and ATP, DTT and the DNA ligase were further added. The mixture was maintained at 12 0C for 24 hours, and then heat treated at 650C for 5 minutes to inactivate the DNA ligase. E. coli K 12 strain tryptophan auxotrophic mutant was transformed with the ligated DNA, and then inoculated in L medium Bacto tryptone 10 g, yeast extract 5 g, NaCl 5 g, glucose 1 g, water 1 liter pH 7.2 containing 50 micrograms ml of ampicillin and cultivated with shaking at 37 0C for 18 hours.The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed and then plated on the minimum medium having the same composition as above to obtain transformants. The transformants were subjected to liquid cultivation, and a plasmid was isolated from the culture broth. The resulting plasmid pMTY 2 has the restriction endonuclease map shown in Figure 1 of the attached drawings. The map was prepared by digesting the plasmid pMTY 2 with restriction endonucleases EcoRI, BamHI, SalI, etc. either singly or in combination, and then subjecting the digestion products to agarose gel electrophoresis. The transformants harboring the plasmid pMTY 2 were deposited in Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Ministry of International Trade and Industry, at 1 1 3, Higashi, Yatabe cho, Tsukuba gun, Ibaraki ken,Japan on September 7, 1984 deposit number FERM P 7838 .
