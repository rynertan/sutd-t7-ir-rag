## Description
METHOD OF TREATING TUMORS IN WARM BLOODED ANIMALS WITH NOVEL COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel compositions of matter useful for ameliorating cancer diseases in mammals.More particularly, it relates to therapeutic compositions containing certain 1,4 bis substituted amino 5,8 dihy droxyanthraquinones which inhibit the growth of transplanted mouse tumors. The invention includes the new compositions of matter and the method of inducing the regression and or palliation of leukemia and related cancers in mammals therewith. The 1,4 bis substituted amino 5,8 di hydroxyanthraquinones of the present invention may be represented by the following structural formula EMI1.1 wherein n is the integer 2 or 3 and Q and Q are each individually selected from the group consisting of moieties of the formulae EMI2.1 wherein m is the integer 2 or 3, with the proviso that at least one of the groups Q and Q must be cyclic.Also included within the purview of the present invention are the leuco bases and tautomers thereof which may be represented by the following general formulae EMI2.2 II, LEUCO BASES III, TAUTOMERIC FORM wherein n, Q and Q are as hereinabove defined. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Certain of the active compounds of the present invention where Q and Q are the same and cyclic are obtainable as blue black crystalline materials having characteristic melting points and absorption spectra and which may be purified by recrystallization or by leaching with lower alkanols. The organic bases of this invention, I, II andIII form non toxic acid addition salts with a variety of pharmacologically acceptable organic and inorganic salt forming reagents. Thus, acid addition salts, formed by admixture of the organic free base with 1,2 or up to eight equivalents of an acid, suitably in a neutral solvent, are formed with such acids as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfamic, citric, lactic, malic, succinic, tartaric, acetic, benzoic, gluconic, ascorbic, and the like. For purposes of this invention the free bases are equivalent to their non toxic acid addition salts.The acid addition salts of the organic bases of the present invention are, in general, crystalline solids, relatively soluble in water, methanol and ethanol but relatively insoluble in non polar organic solvents such as diethyl ether, benezene, toluene, and the like. The active compounds of the present invention may be readily prepared in accordance with the following reaction scheme EMI4.1 wherein R is CH2 m OH and n, m, Q and Q are hereinbefore defined. In accordance with the above reaction scheme, a 1,4 dihydroxy 5,8 bis hydroxyalkylamino alkylamino anthra quinone free base IV may be converted to the fully cyclized product I by stirring and refluxing a mixture of the free base in a solvent such as benzene with two or more equivalents of aqueous formaldehyde 37.1 for a period of 3 hours, then collecting the product by filtration and washing with benzene. Alternatively, when the free base IV in benzene is refluxed as described above with only one equivalent of aqueous formaldehyde, the product I is obtained where only one of Q and Q is cyclic. The precursors IV and general reaction conditions are also set forth in U.S. Patent No. 4,197,249 which is hereby incorporated by reference. The active compounds described herein are useful as chelating, complexing or sequestering agents. The complexes formed with polyvalent metal ions are particularly stable and usually soluble in various organic solvents. These properties, of course, render them useful for a variety of purposes wherein metal ion contamination presents a problem e.g., as stabilizers in various organic systems such as saturated and unsaturated lubricating oils and hydrocarbons, fatty acids and waxes, wherein transition metal ion contamination accelerates oxidative deterioration and color formation. They are further useful in analyses of polyvalent metal ions which may be complexed or extracted by these materials and as metal carriers.Other uses common to sequestering agents are also apparent for these compounds. The active compounds of the present invention also possess the property of inhibiting the growth of transplanted mouse tumors as established by the following tests.Lymphocytic leukemia P388 test The animals used are DBA 2 mice all of one sex, weighing a minimum of 17 g. and all within a 3 g. weight range.

The active ingredients of the therapeutic compositions of the present invention inhibit transplanted mouse tumor growth and induce regression and or palliation of leukemia and related cancers in mammals when administered in amounts ranging from about 0.3 mg. to 100 mg. per square meter of body surface area per day. The interrelationship of dosages for animals of various sizes and species and humans based on mg. m2 of surface area is described by Freireich, E. J., et al., Quantitiative Comparison of Toxicity of Anticancer Agents in Mouse, Rat,Hamster, Dog, Monkey and Man. Cancer Chemother. Rep., 50,No. 4, 219 244, May 1966.A preferred dosage regimen for optimum results would be from about 1.0 mg. m2 day to about 30 mg. m2 day and such dosage units are employed that a total of from about 0.5 mg. to about 60 mg. of the active compound for a subject of about 70 kg. of body weight are administered in a 24 hour period. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response.For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The active compounds may be administered by the intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. The active compounds may be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions or dispersions of the active compound as a free base can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile i njectable solutions or dispersians. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like , suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectabie solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agents is incompatable with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to achieved, and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired as herein disclosed in detail. The principal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form as hereinabefore disclosed. A unit dosage form can, for example, contain the principal active compound in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 200 mg., with from about one to about 30 mg. being preferred. Expressed in proportions, the active compound is generally present in from about 0.1 to about 100 mg. ml.of carrier. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingredients. Regression and palliation of cancers are attained, for example, using intraperitoneal administration. A single intravenous dosage or repeated daily dosages can be administered. Daily dosages up to about 5 or 10 days are often sufficient. It is also possibie to dispense one daily dosage or one dose on alternate or less frequent days. As can be seen from the dosage regimens, the amount of principal active ingredient administered is a sufficient amount to aid regression and palliation of the leukemia or the like, in the absence of excessive deleterious side effects of a cytotoxic nature to the hosts harboring the cancer. As used herein, cancer disease means blood malignancies such as leukemia, as well as other solid and non solid malignancies such as the melanocarcinomas, lung carcinomas, and mammary tumors.By regression and palliation is meant arresting or retarding the growth of the tumor or other manifestation of the disease compared to the course of the disease in the absence of treatment.
