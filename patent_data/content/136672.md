## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR X RAY EXPOSURE The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for X ray exposure to transfer a pattern shape formed on a mask onto a photoresist layer applied to the surface of a wafer. Such as integrated circuits IC or large scale integrated circuits LSI are so manufactured in order to obtain desired circuits as by forming a photoresist layer covering the surface of a wafer made of silicon, transferring a desired pattern formed on a mask onto the photoresist layer, and performing repetitive processings such as etching, ion implantation or the like in accordance with the transferred pattern. In order to attain a more improved integration density for the LSIs or the like, it is necessary to form a miniaturized pattern in which the width of an electric passage constituting electrical circuits is 1 Vm or a more narrower sub micron. In order to meet with such requirements, it has been suggested to employ X rays which have shorter wavelength than conventionally utilized light rays and have a good precision of transferring. Fig. 1 shows an outline of a prior art of stepand repeat type X ray exposure apparatus. X rays 2 from an X ray source 1 are irradiated on a mask 3, and a pattern 4 on the mask 3 is transferred onto a photoresist on a wafer 5.In a precise transferring with a sub micron electric passage width, an exposure onto the surface of the wafer 5 is successively carried out by step and repeat in which by an exposure area at one time is taken in a small area. One of the reasons for this is to improve the precision of dimension. A short wavelength X ray called as a hard X ray for medical care is not used for the X ray source 1, but a low permeability and long wavelength X ray called as a softX ray is used for the X ray source 1 for some reasons associated with the material of the mask described later.More specifically, such as Mo L alpha rays 5.4 or the like, having a wavelength of several to several tens , are used.Soft X rays are selectively used among white X rays, such as obtained from the SOR Synchrotron Orbital Radiation . Next, the problems associated with the prior art step and repeat type X ray exposure apparatus will be described with reference to Figs. 2 and 3. The mask 3 comprises a supporting ring 7 for example, made of silicon , a back ring 8 for reinforcing the supporting ring for example, made of a plate glass , a membrane 9 for example, made of organic material or inorganic material such as BN, Si3Nt or the like applied to and extended along the supporting ring 7 for serving as an X ray permeable member, and a pattern section 10 such as having 0.8 m thickness of gold for patterning by intercepting the X rays. One of the important factors to be considered in transferring of a pattern onto the photoresist layer 6 withX rays, is a contrast C of the pattern 10 at the wavelength of the X rays from the X ray source 1 exposing the photoresist 6. Although it is better the larger the contrast C is, the X ray exposure is hard to obtain a larger contrast regardless of an appropriate selection of the wavelength, due to the fact that X rays are stronger in transmission than visual light rays. An X ray transmission coefficient K of an object irradiated by X rays is expressed in the following formula. K e pt ...... 1 where absorption factor t thicknessThe following relation can be established assuming that theX ray intensity before the transmission into the mask is lor the intensity after the transmission from the pattern is Ip, and the intensity after the transmission from the transmission section is It. I kp . Io 2 p p 0 It t Kt o1o 3 K a transmission coefficient of the pattern p section, Kt an X ray transmission coefficient of the transmission section.Representing a contrast of the exposure at a time called as a shot by C1, thenEMI3.1 Since the step and repeat system carries out a number of shots, the exposure conditions on each portion of the surface of the wafer, however, can not be maintained uniform as illustrated in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, small circle and semicircles on the wafer 5 indicate each shot. That is, for example, the area Al is exposed one time and its contrast isC1. However, in the areas A2 and A3, two times and three times multiple exposures are respectively brought about.More in particular, for example, the area A2 is not exposed with a pattern of an adjacent exposure area, but is irradiated with X rays transmitted through a thin gold layer of an adjacent exposure area so that the contrast is worsened. As a result, the contrasts C2 and C3 for the areas A2 and A3 respectively are EMI4.1 In general, the contrast C N for the N multiple exposure is represented by EMI4.2 Therefore, even if the contrast C1 in the formula 4 is, for example, 10, the contrasts C2 and C3 are largely deteriorated 5.5 and 4 respectively. Therefore, in the case all the areas Al, A2, and A3 are exposed, material should be chosen in correspondence with the area A3 having the smallest contrast.In order to follow the above, the thickness of gold of the pattern section 10 is required to have for example 1 vm. Assuming that the width of a wiring line is 0.5 ism, it is necessary to realize a pattern with an aspect ratio of , which is extraordinary hard to manufacture.Further the difference of contrasts among the areas Al, A2, and A3 becomes large so that the controllability for the width of transferred pattern becomes worse, which results in a great hardness for the control of a wiring line width such as 0.5 pm 0.1 Vm. As described above, in the conventional step andrepeat type X ray exposure system, there occurs such problems as the deterioration of contrast on multiple exposure portions, and the worsening of the control of an electric passage width resulting from the lack of uniformity of contrasts. Thus, the applications utilizing X rays have been suppressed. The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and it is an object to provide a method for X ray exposure and an exposure apparatus suitable for practicing the method as above, in which the X ray exposure for the area other than the required area is intercepted for every shot so that there is no fear of making the contrasts of adjacents areas worsen. A further object is to provide an improved apparatus for X ray exposure which is adaptive to changing of a mask pattern or shot area, while contrast characteristic is improved. In order to accomplish the above objects, an exposure method according to the present invention features in that in a method for exposing X rays in which the X rays radiated by an X ray source are transmitted through an X ray exposure subjecting mask and irradiated upon an X ray exposure subjecting substrate, and in which a pattern provided on the mask is transferred onto the substrate, the method for X ray exposure comprising providing between the X ray source and the substrate a stop for the X rays constructed as of a different body from the exposure subjecting mask, and intercepting the incident X rays to the portion other than the exposure portion on the substrate surface. Further, in order to carry out the above method with ease and to sufficiently display the effects thereof, an apparatus for exposing X rays according to the present invention features in that in an apparatus for X ray exposure constructed in such a manner that an X ray source and an X ray exposure subjecting mask are provided, means for fixing and moving, relative to one another, three of the two members and an X ray exposure subjecting substrate, and the X rays radiated from the X ray source are passed through the X ray exposure subjecting mask and irradiated upon the X ray exposure subjecting substrate so as to transfer a pattern on the mask onto the substrate, the apparatus for X ray exposure comprising providing between the X ray source and the substrate stop means for the X rays constructed as of a different body from the mask. The present invention will be apparent trom t è following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view simplified an X ray exposure apparatus for explaining the X ray exposure,Fig. 2 is a vertical sectional view of a prior art X ray exposure apparatus, Fig. 3 is a plan view showing the top surface of a wafer in the X ray exposure apparatus of Fig.Fig. 4 is a vertical section showing one embodiment according to the present invention, Fig. 5 is a plan view showing the top surface of a wafer in the above embodiment ofFig. 4, Fig. 6 is a diagram for explaining the position precision in the above embodiment of Fig. 4, Figs. 7 are concrete arrangements of masks in the above embodiment ofFig. 4, wherein Fig. 7A is a plan view and Fig. 7B is a vertical section. Figs. 8 through 10 are vertical sections of masks different from the above embodiment, Fig. 11 is a plan view showing a top surface of a stop according to further embodiment of the invention, Fig. 12, is a plan view showing a top surface of a stop according to further embodiment of the invention, and Fig. 13 is a partial plan view of the stop according to the other embodiment of the invention. One of the embodiments according to the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 4 to 7. Fig. 4 is a diagram conceptually showing a stop means for intercepting surplus X rays in accordance with the present invention, and Fig. 5 is a view for lustratzg the operation of the stop means. By X rays 2 from an X ray source 1, a pattern section 10 on a mask 3 is transferred onto a photoresist 6 on a wafer 5. The radiation area of the X rays 2 reaching the mask 3 is restricted by a stop 11 on the mask 3 such that as shown in Fig. 5 each shot 12 is not subject to a multiple exposure even under the exposure method of a step and repeat system. The stop 11 according to the present invention is not for limiting the amount of rays passing through the stop, but is for restricting the exposure area for the X rays passing through the stop. That is, in Fig. 4, assuming the condition where the stop 11 is temporarily removed, the X ray on an optical path shown by an imaginary arrow line 2a among the X rays 2 reaches a point S outside an exposure area EX through it is weakened by a thin gold film of the pattern section 10.Therefore, the contrasts of the portions adjacent to the exposure area Ex are worsened. However, with the stop 11 provided as shown inFig. 4, the X rays reaching outside of the exposure area Es are fully intercepted so that the contrasts for the adjacent areas are not deteriorated. In order to attain the above effects, the stop 11 is made of a material not allowing the transmission of X rays more in detail, by using a material with a low transmission coefficient for X rays, having such a thickness that makes it possible to consider the transmission amount of X rays as substantially zero in a practical use , and is constructed to have a configuration described later in detail convering the area other than the exposure area Ex. A detailed description is further given as to the shielding effects of the above stop 11. The intensity 1B of an X ray passing the stop 11 is 1B 10 KB ........ 8 wherein KB is an X ray transmission coefficient of the stop 11. Similar to the formulas 4 to 6 explained with the prior art, the calculation of the contrasts C1 , C2 , and C31 for areas Al , A2 , and A3 yields EMI9.1 The contrast CN1 for the area subjecting to N multiple exposures is generally represented by EMI9.2 which shows that the contrast for such an area is large when compared with that represented by the formula 7 indicative of the contrast in the prior art. The material quality and thickness of the stop 11 are selected in compliance with the following procedure and criterion 1 N is determined by the maximum number of multiple exposures in the step and repeat process. 2 the contrast and contrast precision necessary for transferring the pattern section 10 are determined and represented as Cp i Cp. P 3 the above determinations along with the formulas 12 and 9 , give the following CN C1 C11 S 2ACp2 Cp ......... 13 and cN 2 Cp ACp .......... 14 1B is determined so as to suffice the formulas 13 and 14 , then the transmission coefficient is determined from the formula 8 , and the material quality and thickness are derived from the formula 1 . The material quality and thickness of the stop 11 have been determined from the preceding description. Next, the position of the stop 11 will be described with reference to Fig. 6. In an X ray exposure, a penumbra Bp of the pattern section 10 is existed on the photoresist 6 by theX ray source 1 with a dimension of d.EMI10.1 where L a distance between the pattern section 10 and the X ray source 1, G a gap between the pattern sect nd the photoresist 6.The stop 11 as well produces a penumbra B B as shown in the figure EMI11.1 where M a distance between the stop 11 and the pattern section.The penumbra B is a distance between the adjacent shots 12 refer to Fig. 5 , and it is commonly a scribe area about 50 to 100 vim . If an allowance value for the penumbra BB, a penumbra Bp, an X ray source diameter d, and a gap G are determined, then, by using the formulas 15 and 16 i the distance of the stop 11 from the pattern section 10 is determined. Further, the precision for determining the position of the stop 11 in horizontal direction with respect to the mask surface may be determined by the space between adjacent shots in consideration of the penumbra BB, such that the tolerances of the stop position and penumbra B B are included within the space of shots. A concrete plan view of the mask 3 in the above embodiment is shown in Fig. 7A, and the similar front section is shown in Fig. 7B. A stop 11 made of aluminum plate of 1 mmt is bonded between the supporting ring 7 and the back ring 8. The inner edge surface cut out of the aluminum plate are machined in accordance with the radiation angle 13 of the X ray 2. In addition, flatness of the machined inner edge surface of stop 11 is finished within about t1 vm. Moreover, an alignment aperture 14 is provided for enabling an alignment. In the case when the alignment pattern is not transferred, a shutter 15 may be mounted at the side of the X ray source. The construction and position of the shutter 15 are determined similarly to the stop 11.The shutter 15 is of such an arrangement that when the alignment is carried out it is opened and when the exposure is carried out it is closed. The working for the edge surface of the stop 11 made of aluminum can be dispensed with sometimes depending upon the precision for determining the position of the penumbra B B or the like. Fig. 8 shows another embodiment different from the one described above. In this embodiment, a back ring 16 is provided which has both functions of the supporting ring and the back ring. Fig. 9 shows a further different embodiment in which a stop supporting ring 17 is provided which has both functions of the supporting ring and the stop. Fig. 10 shows a still further different embodiment.In this embodiment, attached to a membrane 9 is a stop 18 which comprises an upper stop 18a provided for the adjustment of a tension force of the membrane and a lower stop 18b provided at the lower side of the membrane 9. In the embodiment just described above, either one of the upper and lower stops 18a and 18b may be omitted.Also, it may be possible to additionally employ each stop means respectively described in the above embodiments. The other embodiments will be explained with referring to Figs. 11 to 13 below. Fig. 11 shows only a stop apparatus which is formed by two separated movable plates 110. The movalbe plates 110 can be slided in the horizontal direction of arrows X and Y manually or by a driving device, so that the opening shape or area can be varied at one s desire. Therefore in this embodiment, the X ray exposure apparatus can adaptive to various shapes of the patterns without deteriorating contrast characteristic, and can also expose only a particular portion of wafer. In further embodiment of Fig. 12, the opening of the stop 11 is fixed. However, another plate 111 which is un permiable to X ray covers the opening. The shape and area of the opening can be controlled by sliding the plate 111 so as to obtain same effects as shown in the embodiment of Fig. 11. In the other embodiment of Fig. 13, the opening is covered by a layer of which material is permiable toX ray. Another plate 112 which is non permiable to X ray is disposed on the opening layer. Therefore, X ray can be passed only an area other than the plate 112 in the opening of the stop 11. An area of the exposing shot can be controlled according to the shape and position of the plate 112. In addition to above embodiments, stop 11 can be rotated in a horizontal plane so as to change shot area of the wafer. As seen from the above detailed description of a method for X ray exposure according to the tion, excellent practical effects can be obtained wherein the X ray exposure for the area other than the required area is intercepted for every shot so that there is no fear of making the contrasts of adjacents areas worsen. Further, according to the X ray exposure apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to practice the above method with ease and to sufficiently manifest the effects thereof.
