# Supercharger carry over venting means.

## Abstract
An improved supercharger of blower 10 of the Roots type with reduced airborne noise and improved efficiency. The blower includes a housing 12 defining generally cylindrical chambers 32, 34 containing meshed lobed rotors 14, 16 having the lobes 14a, 14b, 14c, 16a, 16b, 16c thereon formed with an end to end helical twist according to the relation 360 2n, where n equals the number of lobes per rotor. The chambers include cylindrical wall surfaces 20a, 20b and end wall surfaces 20C, 24a which sealing cooperate with the rotor lobes and ends. Blower housing 12 also defines inlet and outlet ports 36, 38 . The inlet port includes a longitudinal extent defined by housing wall surfaces 20f, 20f and a transverse extent defined by housing wall surfaces 20g, 20i. Transverse wall surfaces 20g, 20i are disposed substantially parallel to the associated rotor lobes. The outlet port includes a longitudinal extent defined by housing surfaces 20m, 20r and a transverse extent defined by housing surfaces 20p, 20s . Spaces 32a, 34a between adjacent lobes of each rotor transfer volumes of low pressure inlet port air to relatively high pressure outlet port air. Associated with the outlet port are first and second expanding orifices 42, 44 disposed on transversely oppo site sides of the outlet port for controlling the rate of backflow into the transfer volumes and operative at predeter mined rotor speed and pressure differential relationships to maintain a substantially constant backflow rate into each of the transfer volumes. Pairs of arcuate channels 46, 48 and 58, 60 are respectively formed in end walls 20c, 24a to vent trapped volumes ΣTV₁ and ΣTV₂ defined by meshing lobes. Channels 46, 48 prevent compression of air in trapped volumes ΣTV₁ and channels ΣTV₂ prevent vacuum tending expansion of trapped volumes ΣTV₂.
