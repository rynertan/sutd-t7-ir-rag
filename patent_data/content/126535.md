# Fiber reinforced glass matrix composites.

## Abstract
What is disclosed is a method of preparing fiber reinforced glass composites from high modulus fibers and organopolysilox ane resins. The composites are obtained by firing a partially cured, pressed, and post cured prepreg to an elevated tempera ture in an inert atmosphere. A simple, low temperature laminating procedure is used in the composite preparation in place of the standard hot pressing technique.
