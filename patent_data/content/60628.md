# Tuned small loop antenna.

## Abstract
A tunable small loop antenna, having an input admittance, for transmitting or receiving signals within the VHF and UFH frequency band and tunable over a wide range of resonant fre quencies while substantially maintaining impedance matching between the antenna and an antenna feeder line comprises a loop conductor 1 having a loop area, circumferential length and equivalent conductor radius, a capacitive element 2 con nected in series with the loop conductor 1 for providing a resonant circuit having a loaded Q of not less than 20. In this antenna, the loop area, circumferential length and equivalent radius are selected so that the ratio of the resonant frequency f
