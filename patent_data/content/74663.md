# AID FOR A RECEPTIONIST

## Abstract
A receptionist s aid has a memory for storing reception ist s information input through a processing means, and has a display screen for displaying input and recalled informa tion. The aid can interact with a private automatic branch exchange to automatically receive extension numbers di alled from the private automatic branch exchange by a telephonist, and recall information stored in the memory which represents a person to be found at that extension number. Persons can access their respective memory facili ties by dialling their own extension number, and by dialling further predetermined codes can store and delete their own receptionist s information in and from the memory.
