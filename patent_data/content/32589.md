## Description
LOG SPLITTER WITH PROTECTION AGAINST TWISTING MOMENTS This application has a connection with my prior European application Number 80.103.600.5, filed June 25, 1980, entitled LOG SPLITTER IMPROVED CLAMP . This invention relates to log splitters and in particular to log splitters intended for home use. Such a log splitter must meet demanding requirements for economy and portability. The cost must be low enough that the user can make substantial savings by the use of the splitter and it must be light enough that it can be readily moved about by one person. Such a log splitter, however, must also be capable of exerting the large forces, for example of the order of 10 or 12 tons, required for splitting logs and which are accompanied from time to time by the inevitable generation of large twisting moments. The requirements for light weight precludes the use of a construction sturdy enough to withstand the direct forces of these twisting moments.However, by supporting the log substantially at one point and applying the splitting force at a directly opposite point1 the twisting moments transmitted to the supporting frame can be minimized. Nevertheless, if adequate splitting force is to be provided, certain logs will cause the generation of twisting moments large enough to permanently distort the frame of the splitter. I have, previous to the present invention, attempted to protect the frame from damage by the use of a tiltable ram guide mounted atop the power driven ram and having guide wheels at each end, positioned at a level considerably below the point of engagement with the ram head, that engaged frame members of circular cross section. However, the inevitable twisting moments generally cause a rotation of the ram guide about its longitudinal axis, and this rotation during the upward movement of the ram guide causes the guide wheels to follow an angular path along the frame members and to disengage therefrom even though no twisting moments have been generated of sufficient magnitude to damage the log splitter.Summary of the Invention The invention is embodied in a log splitter in which the log to be split is centrally supported at one end while the opposite end of the log is engaged by the point of a splitting wedge that is clamped in position and caused to split the log by forces applied to the lop support. In accordance with the present invention, the log is supported on a ram guide having a central area making contact with the log and to which is applied the force that pushes the log into the splitting wedge. The ram guide is arranged so that the generation of offcenter forces in excess of a certain magnitude will cause the ram guide to tilt while notched end portions of the ram guide, which encompass the width of the supporting frame members, move parallel with the axes of the frame members.This tilting of the ram guide gives a visual indication to the operator that twisting moments are being generated and, if the forces are allowed to become large enough, causes the ram guide to disengage from the frame members and abort the splitting operation before the forces reach a magnitude that would damage the log splitter. Rrief Description of the Drawing Figure 1 is a front view of a log splitter embody ing the invention Figure 2 is a top view of the ram guide forming part of the log splitter shown in figure 1 Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a longitudinal sectional view taken along line 4 4 of Figure 2 Figure 5 is a partial front view showing the position of the ram guide when the splitting operation generates substantial twisting moments and Figure 6 is a similar view illustrating the position of the ram guide under greater twisting monments and in position to cause the splitting operation to abort.Description of the Preferred Embodiment As shown in Figure 1, a splitting wedge 2 is mounted on a carriage assembly, generally indicated at 6, which is releasably clamped to two spaced, parallel, upright frame members 8 and 8a. Two clamps 10 and 10a by which the carriage is secured to the frame members may for example be of the type described in the aboveidentified co pending applications and are caused tc release the carriage assembly from the frame members 8 and 8a by manually actuating the clamps with the aid of a handle 12. The frame members 8 and 8a may be formed of lengths of pipe, but I prefer to use H beams of cold rolled steel as shown in Figure 2. The frame members 8 and 8a are supported by a base 14 that is welded to a pair of perpendicular U shaped runners 16 and 18 on which the log splitter rests. This base 14 also serves as a support for a hydraulic jack 20, which sits upon but is not secured to the base 111, and which has an upwardly extending ram 22 on which rests a ram guide, generally indicated at 24. The upper end of the ram 22 carries an enlarged head 26 Figure 4 having a conical upper surface 28 that fits into a corresponding socket formed in the under surface of a conical central section 30 of the ram guide 24. The ram guide is thus self centering on the ram 22 but is not otherwise secured thereto.By terminating the ram head 26 in a cone, as shown, the ram guide resists tilting until the twisting moments become great enough that the wall of the socket area of the ram guide rides up on the tip of the cone.The force required to tilt the ram guide is a function of the splitting force and the steepness of the cone on the end of the ram head and will be adjusted so that the force required for tilting will always be less than that which would damage the frame of the log splitter.Alternatively, the top of the ram head may be ball shaped and the socket area of the ram head shaped accordingly.With this arrangement, the force required to tilt the ram guide is primarily a function of the splitting force. I prefer, however, not to provide a flat surface on the end of the ran head because of the loss of the self centering feature and because when the ram guide tilts, excessive forces may be concentrated on one edge of the ram head. For reasons to be explained later, the conical upper surface of the ram guide 24 slopes downwarly from its apex at an angle of 30 degrees from the horizontal as indicated by the angle a in Figure 11. The conical central section of the ram terminates in a short arcuate wall 32 that leads to two opposing outwardly extending channel sections 34 and 34a. The two channel sections are identical in construction and only one of them is described in detail. In the other section, similar portions are referred to by similar numerals followed by the suffix a . The channel section 34 is generally U shaped as shown in Figure 3, with outwardly extending flanges 35 and 38 along its lower edges for reinforcement of the structure.The upper surface 40 of the channel section slopes downwardly so that the height of the side walls 112 and 44 Figures 1 and 2 of the channel section decreases outwardly from the center of the ram guide 24. The slope of the surface 40 of the channel section is less than the slope of the upper surface of the conical central section 30 and, in this example, is 81Q from the horizontal as shown by the angle b in Figure 4. The angle between the horizontal and a line connecting the apex of the central conical section 30 to the outer end of the ram guide 211 is 15 degrees as indicated by the angle c in Figure 4. The outer end of the channel section 34 terminates in a notch 46 that forms ears 118 and 50 that extend on opposite sides of the frame member 8. The width of the notch 115 and 46a, as indicated at d in Figure 2, is greater than the width of the frame member 8 along which it moves to provide clearance for movement along the frame. The depth of the notch 46 is such that adeauate clearance is provided at the end of the ram guide 24 to permit it to move smoothly along the axis of the frame member 8 while restricting the longitudinal movement of the ram guide.The ram guide may be formed from a single piece of metal by stamping or forging. The frame members are illustrated as H beams with the ears 48 and 50 moving along the wider flat surfaces.If desired, the frame members may be positioned at a 900 angle from that shown, the choice being dependent upon the particular clamping mechanism used for the carriage 6. If one elects to use the clamping mechanism described in my co pending application Serial No. 06 053,199, it is desirable to position the frame members at an angle of 900 from that shown in the drawing. It is important that the surface of the ram guide 211 slope downwardly away from the conical center section 30, as stated above, so that the outside edge of the log will not rest on the ram guide. However, it is important also that the vertical distance between the point where the ram head 26 engages the ram guide and the level of the ears 48 and 50, as indicated by the dimension g in Figure 4, be as short as possible so that a minimal sideways rocking movement of the ram guide will not cause the ear 48 or 50 to bind on the frame. The angle e of 15 degrees between the horizontal and a line connecting the the end of the ram guide at ears 48 and 50 with the apex of the conical section 30 meets both of these requirements in a satisfactory manner.The angle used will depend somewhat upon the size and structure of the splitter, but preferably will be be at least 10 degrees and not more than 20 degrees. The ram guide 24 is maintained in engagement with the ram head 26 by two tension springs 51 and 51a which are secured at one end by ears 52 and 52a to the ram guide and which extend downwardly and outwardly at an angle and are secured at their opposite ends to the base 14. These springs permit vertical movement of the ram guide and also permit it to tilt when the twisting moments are applied and return it to a horizontal position when the force is removed. In use, the lower end of a log to be split, indicated in broken lines at 53 in Figure 1, is placed on the conical section 30 and held in place while the carriage clamps 10 and 10a are released and the splitting wedge 2 lowered to make contact with the upper end of the log.The hydraulic jack 20 is then actuated, for example by a power mechanism as described in the above identified copending application, forcing the ram guide 24 upwardly and causing the wedge 2 to penetrate and split the log.Because both weight and economy are essential to a log splitter intended for home use, the frame members must be relatively light in weight, a condition that is possible only if the predominate forces applied to the frame members 8 and 8a are tensile forces parallel with the axes of the frame members. The generation of twisting moments is minimized by the conical support 30 which is positioned in line with the point 54 of the wedge 2. Because of the shape of the ram guide and the downwardly sloping surfaces 40 and 40a, only the center portion of the log makes contact with the ram guide. The conical section 30 will make some penetration of the log, but it is important that this penetration be limited and that the log not make contact with the ram guide at any point other than the conical section 30.In practice, the section 30, which has a partially conical surface in order to limit the width of the ram guide 24, may have a diameter, in the lengthwise direction of the ram guide, indicated by the dimension e in Figure 2, of about 3 inches. The conical section 30, crosswise of the ram guide has a dimension f of about 2 inches. By a conical surface is meant a surface of any circumferential shape generally tapering to a point or other shape that will prevent the log from slipping sideways when the splitting force is applied. For example such a conical surface could be generally rounded with a central projection or point to anchor the log, or it could be such a rounded surface with a smaller flat top on which the log can rest. If the conical section 30 is too small, it will penetrate the log, particularly when softer woods are being split, and allow the log to make contact with the surface 40 or 40a of the ram guide and generate excessive twisting moments that if the splitting action were not aborted would distort the frame members 8 and 8a. If the conical section 30 is too large, excessive twisting moments may be generated by contact with the conical section itself.If the relatively steep angle of thirty degrees or so is maintained over the full width of an excessively large conical section, trouble may be experienced with binding of the ram guide on the members 8 and 8a as a result of the greater vertical distance from the point of engagement between the ram head 26 and the ram guide 24 to the ends of the ram guide where they are in sliding engagement with the frame members 8 and 8a. In practice, the surface of the conical section 30 may have an area as little as one square inch and a maximum area of as much as 12 square inches. The angle of the conical surface from the hori zontal is shown as 30 degrees and preferably is between 25 and 35 degrees. The angle b between the horizontal and the surfaces 40 and 40a is illustrated as 8 1 2 degrees and is preferably between 6 and 12 degrees. For the most part, logs to be split do not have exactly perpendicular ends and, if the angle of cut is large enough, one edge of the log may make contact with the upper surface 40 or 40a of the ram guide. This can usually be prevented by rotating the log around its longitudinal axis or turning it end for end. If the outer edge of the log is allowed to make contact with the ram guide, the ram guide will tilt during the spitting action, to prevent the build up of excessive twisting moments, making it necessary to stop the splitting action and remove the log. Excessive twisting moments of sufficient magnitude to permanently distort the frame members 8 and 8a may be caused by variations in the density of the wood, because of knots or other reasons, or by the direction of the grain of the wood, which may not always be parallel with the direction of movement of the log during the splitting operation. The ram guide 24 serves two functions when such excessive twisting moments are encountered. The eccentric force causes the ram guide to tilt on the coni cal surface of the ram head 26, as illustrated in Figure 5. This visual indication of the presence of excessive twisting moments permits the operator to stop the splitting action and remove or re position the log.However, if the operator fails to stop the splitting action, no damage is done to the frame of the unit because the splitting action is automatically aborted. As shown inFigure 6, when the angle of tilt reaches a critical limit, one or both of the retaining notches 46 and 116a retreat from the frame members enough that the ears 48 and 50 can no longer serve to restrict the lateral movement of the ram guide and the entire assembly including the ram guide 24 and the jack 20 topples over. The jack 20 has no lateral stability. Because the jack is not required to resist lateral movement, it can be much lighter construction than would otherwise be required. The lateral.stability in the horizontal plane, while the ram guide is horizontal or not tilted enough to disengage, is provided by the notches in the ram guide cooperating with the frame members. From the foregoing it will be seen that my invention makes it possible to fabricate a log splitter of lighter weight and lower cost than would be possible without the protection provided by the visual indication and fail safe operation of the ram guide. It will be seen that the invention is subject to a variety of modifications in form and structure to best adapt it to each particular log splitter design and construction.I CLAIM
