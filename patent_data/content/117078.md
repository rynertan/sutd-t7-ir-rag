# Automatic laminator.

## Abstract
Apparatus for automatically laminating photoresist dry film 52 onto each of a plurality of panels 63 stacked upright in a panel feed unit 16 with a 10 DEG slant counterclockwise from the vertical, the film being easily contaminated, limp and tacky, although peelable, thereby enabling the use of a polyethylene protective coating, includes a film feed bar 28 for pulling the film from a roll 18 into a laminating station 22 on a 10 DEG upward slant, the polyethylene coating being wound on a take up roll 20 . It further includes a film hold bar, a film hold cutoff bar 30 and a film cutoff knife 24 for cutting the film precisely to the length required for folding the film over a panel 62 on both sides with no overlap. A panel pick up unit 14 picks up each of the panels 62 in succession and moves it down into engagement with a transverse center line on the film 52 , through a laminating nip and between heated laminating rolls 26 , and delivery belts 50 and cooperating lugs move the laminated panel to delivery stack 44 . The film feed, film hold, and film hold cutoff bars, and the panel pcik up unit include vacuum cups and or cavities for handling the film and the panels. The sequential operation of the several components is controlled by a microprocessor.
