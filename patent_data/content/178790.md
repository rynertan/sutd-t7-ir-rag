## Description
This invention relates to improvements in processes and materials for carrying out specific binding assays. Included among specific binding assays are the well known immunoassays, as well as corresponding assay schemes in which, instead of an immunological pair, e.g., antigen or hapten and antibody, another kind of specific binding pair is involved, such as a hormone and its corresponding binding protein from serum, or biotin and avidin or streptavidin. A variety of techniques is known for carrying out enzyme linked and other forms of label linked immunoassay, in which an enzyme or other label fixed to a member of a specific binding pair involved in the assay, has its activity determined as an index of the amount of labelled material present in the free or bound state. The prior art is rich in variety of patterns of reaction scheme and assay configuration, as well as in the variety of particular specific binding pairs involved in the assays. Illustrative examples of specifications describing such assays are USP 3 654 090, Also included in the prior art are devices for carrying out immunotests for antigens, in which reagent zones are arranged in the form of solid or fibrous layers containing various reagents needed for the tests GB 2 111 676, Liotta . In the devices of GB 2 111 676, a layer of immobilised antigen intervenes between a layer where sample and enzyme linked antibody are applied, and a colour forming layer, so that in principle only the labelled antibodies bound to the sample can penetrate to the colour forming layer. Specification GB A 2 023 816 Damon describes immunotests in which an antibody for carrying out an immunotest of the separation type is occluded within semipermeable nylon microcapsules the test is specific for a freely diffusible analyte such as thyroxin or cortisol etc and the free or bound portion after a binding reaction is estimated from the quantity of labelled material within or outside the capsules. The prior art also contains many other clinical assay arrangements, e.g. glucose indicators as exampled in GB 2 036 963 Miles and GB 2 026 160 VEB Arzneimittelwerk Dresden , EP 0 058 334 Miles and EP 0 078 971 Behringwerke , and the devices and tests of EP 0 110 173 Lifescan , WO 84 02004 Quidel and WO 79 01081 Battelle . USP 4 233 402 Syva discloses so called enzyme channelling immunoassays, which involve conjugates of two different enzyme labels, one with each of two complementary specific binding partners. The product of the first enzyme e.g., hydrogen peroxide from glucose oxidase is a substrate for the second enzyme e.g. horseradish peroxidase , and the molecular coupling between the two different enzyme molecules in the resulting immune complexes is mentioned as giving enhanced production of colour product. Further enzyme channelling assays are mentioned in Monoclonal Antibodies and Developments in Immunoassay 1981, Elsevier pp 109 119, in an article entitled Homogeneous Enzyme Immunoassay Techniques for Proteins , by E.F. Ullmann, in one example of which the conjugate of one enzyme and binding pair member is coupled to agarose beads, and catalase is supplied to consume hydrogen peroxide which escapes without reacting with bound enzyme, to minimise its reaction with unbound enzyme. GB 2019562 Syva describes such systems in detail. The present invention aims to provide a number of novel assay arrangements which can be widely applied to many different analytes, with a common reaction pattern which provides relative simplicity and convenience in use. According to the invention there is provided a process for carrying out a label linked specific binding assay, e.g. an immunoassay, comprising the steps of Also provided by the invention is a test kit for carrying out the said specific binding assay, e.g. an immunoassay, the test kit comprising Several examples of the invention correspond to an assay system and corresponding process and test kit for carrying out a label linked specific binding assay e.g. an immunoassay , wherein a label is used which either is a first coreagent which is reactive with a second coreagent in a reaction to produce a detectable result, or is a generator of said first coreagent, said label being linked to a member of a specific binding pair relevant to the assay, to form a labelled specific binding material, said assay system comprising a bounded zone containing a dispersed quantity of said second coreagent in said reaction, or a generator of said second coreagent, said bounded zone also carrying an immobilised member of said specific binding pair, an aqueous reaction zone comprising a consumer of one of the coreagents in said reaction, together with said labelled specific binding material, whereby in use the assay reaction results in the binding of a variable quantity of said labelled member of said specific binding pair in said bounded zone, so that said detectable result is produced by reaction of the coreagent in the bounded zone with the labelling material or the coreagent generated by said labelling material. In the assay system, the first coreagent can be for example a participant in a luminescent reaction, or an enzyme that catalyses directly or indirectly a luminescent or chromogenic or fluorogenic reaction, and the mentioned second coreagent is for example a further reactant in said reaction or an enzyme that catalyses said reaction. A generator of said coreagent can be for example an enzyme that catalyses a reaction of which the product is said coreagent, or a system that generates said co reagent non enzymically. The bounded zone can be for example a discrete zone, for example that formed by a gel or capsule or bead, and the surface thereof, optionally together with the zone molecularly adjacent to said surface, i.e., that zone which contains any molecules directly or indirectly sorbed to said surface. The immobilised member of said specific binding pair can for example be carried on said surface, and can be fixed there by The said second coreagent in said reaction or generator thereof which is dispersed in said bounded zone is occluded or entrapped there, e.g. by occlusion of free coreagent or generator within liposomes or membrane microcapsules or entrapment during polymerisation of a polymer such as acrylic polymer. The boundary between the bounded and the aqueous reaction zones in examples described below is such as to prevent the consumer reagent which can be for example an enzyme from penetrating or dispersing or diffusing into said bounded zone, and in many cases also prevents the labelled specific binding material from penetrating further than the surface and or the molecularly adjacent layer of the bounded zone. The discretely bounded zone can contain either an enzymic or non enzymic generator of the second coreagent, or a supply of the second coreagent. In particular examples of the test kit, a first reagent preparation comprises a preparation of beads or capsules to provide the bounded zone, carrying immobilised specific binding material and containing a hydrogen peroxide generating system as second coreagent generating system, and said second reagent preparation comprises a second specific binding material, complimentary to the first, linked to a peroxidase enzyme or a peroxide reactive chemiluminescent label material, the text kit also comprising catalase in use to consume any hydrogen peroxide in the aqueous reaction zone outside the beads or capsules , and optionally also a chromogenic or fluorogenic or luminescent material to give a detectable result upon reaction with the label and the reactant. Usually, the label is brought into contact with the second coreagent in the bounded zone by arranging that there is a determinate quantity of specific binding material located in immobilised form in the bounded zone, to bind a variable quantity of the label linked to one of the specific binding partners in the assay reaction, according to the quantity of analyte present in the test system. According to a convenient arrangement within the scope of the invention, the second coreagent is diffusible, is supplied or provided in the bounded zone, and its effective absence from the aqueous reaction zone is assured by a consumer reagent in the aqueous reaction zone that effectively consumes the coreagent diffused from the bounded zone, i.e. to prevent it from undergoing appreciable or substantial reaction with the label in the aqueous reaction zone. The label and the second coreagent are chosen so that they can react together in the bounded zone to produce a detectable result. In many examples, a suitable label is for example an enzyme, and a detectable product results from reaction of the enzyme and the second coreagent, e.g. a coloured or fluorescent product, or a result that is detectable in some other way, e.g. as a luminescent reaction. In many examples of this system, a co reactant is present, which reacts with the second coreagent and enzyme to produce the product. The second coreagent can be for example a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide, the co reactant can be a chromogen or fluorogen or a reactant in a luminescent reaction, and the enzyme can be a peroxidase. Any co reactant in the system can but need not be localised to the bounded zone it can for example be soluble and present in solution in aqueous liquid forming the aqueous reaction zone. An alternative suitable enzyme, to be occluded within gel or microcapsules, is yeast methanol oxidase, supplied with substrate quantities of methanol and oxygen, thereby to supply hydrogen peroxide as a reactant for the assay. In alternative embodiments, the label need not be an enzyme it can for example be a luminescent substance. A suitable example of such a substance is an N methylated product of a 9 acridine carboxyl group, which reacts with H₂O₂ as the reactant, to give a light output. Where appropriate, references to enzyme herein include the case of another type of reactive label. These arrangements can for example be provided by means of a biphasic or two compartment system in which diffusible coreagent is supplied or provided, e.g. by a coreagent generating system, in the first phase or compartment and diffuses into the second phase or compartment where it is consumed by the consumer reagent. This arrangement offers the advantage of example of enabling the production of immunoassays in which the result is indicated by a colour reaction, with unusually definite endpoints at high or low analyte levels, and very few liquid addition operations. Often the minimum rate of colour formation attainable in a chromogenic immunoassay is an appreciable fraction of the maximum rate of colour formation, and many liquid addition operations are needed. In a further alternative embodiment, the bounded zone of the reaction system can contain a chromogenic, fluorogenic or luminescent coreagent or plural number of coreagents, e.g., horseradish peroxidase with one of its substrates mentioned herein, carried in for example a polymer gel which is sufficiently crosslinked to exclude entry of catalase, and carrying specific binding activity fixed to the gel surface, and the label can be a generator of a remaining coreagent, e.g. glucose oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide. In this arrangement the unbound labelled material generates hydrogen peroxide coreagent in the aqueous liquid adjacent to the gel, but the consumer reagent catalase consumes it. Upon binding of the labelled material to the gel surface the generated coreagent can produce a detectable result by reaction with the materials contained within the gel. The provision of a consumer reagent or otherwise of a reactant free zone enables the minimum rate of colour formation to be brought down much lower than usual and ideally to zero. A further advantage of this assay arrangement lies in the facility to provide all reagents together in one reaction volume. There is no need to separate free labelled material from bound labelled material, nor to separate the reaction liquid for the specific binding step s from the reaction liquid in which a chromogenic or fluorogenic enzyme reaction takes place in order to enable detection of the assay result. Using the techniques described herein, it is possible and advantageous to add in a single reaction liquid or reaction system all the components of the assay including the chromogen or fluorogen or other co reactant such as luminescent material . The bounded zone of the assay system of the invention can effectively comprise the first phase or compartment of the biphasic or two compartment system mentioned above, together with so much of the interphase or interfacial region as contains appreciable supplies of the reactant, and the aqueous reaction zone effectively comprises the rest of the second phase or compartment. Under these conditions, the enzyme can be brought into contact with the second coreagent by a binding event which fixes it in the interphase or interfacial zone. For example, the interfacial or interphase zone can include a gel surface or a membrane having fixed thereto specific binding sites to which the enzyme can become bound, e.g. in the form of a conjugate with a member of the specific binding pair relevant to the assay, to an extent dependent on the quantity if any of analyte which can be one member of the specific binding pair present in the system. The specific binding sites can be provided by for example The way in which the enzyme becomes bound can correspond to any of the ways in which enzymes have heretofore been bound to immunoadsorbents during the course of immunoassay. For example, in several arrangements an enzyme linked to an antigen or hapten can become bound to an antibody immunosorbent in inverse relation to the quantity of analyte antibody or antigen or hapten which is available for previous binding or completion with respectively the enzyme conjugate or the immunoadsorbent. This is the pattern tht occurs in for example a competitive immunoassay. Alternatively the enzyme linked to an antibody or antigen can become bound to immunosorbent in direct proportion to the quantity of analyte that can be bound both by the immunosorbent and by the conjugate although these latter do not otherwise appreciably bind with each other. This is the pattern that occurs in for example a sandwich immunoassay or an antiglobulin test or an immunoglobulin capture assay. For example, a competition assay can be arranged by attachment of antibody to the interphase or interfacial zone, e.g. anti beta 2 microglobulin or anti C reactive protein, and the enzyme to be brought into effective contact with the reactant can be provided in a form in which it is conjugated, by any suitable known conjugation technique, to the corresponding antigen, namely beta 2 microglobulin or C reactive protein. The analyte in such a case can be the corresponding antigen itself. By way of further example, a sandwich assay can be arranged again by attachment of antibody to the interphase or interfacial zone, e.g. anti ferritin or anti hepatitis B surface antigen or anti immunoglobulin E . A further antibody also with specificity for the same antigen can then be used in the form of its conjugate with the enzyme to be brought into effective contact with the second coreagent It is within the scope of the invention to link the label to the specific binding material or bindable material in an indirect manner, e.g. as a label occluded in a preparation of microcapsules or liposomes such as those described in EP 0 014 530 and or a label linked to a further binding material such as an antiglobulin with affinity for the material which it is intended to label. It will be apparent to the reader that any specificity can be imparted to the assay materials provided by this invention upon appropriate choice of specific binding components. One convenient method of providing an interphase or interfacial zone including an immunosorbent capacity is to provide beads or capsules containing a second coreagent generating system together with an immunosorbent surface. For example, polyacrylamide beads containing a second coreagent generating system can be provided with immunosorbent surfaces. In one very suitable example of a second coreagent generating system, an enzyme to generate the coreagent is immobilised or occluded in the bounded zone, e.g. dispersed within a bead or capsule, e.g. a crosslinked polyacrylamide bead, but unable itself to escape into the aqueous reaction zone, which can be liquid surrounding the bead or capsule. A suitable example preparation of beads or capsules for this purpose comprises beads of 20 500 µm micron diameter, sufficient to allow free diffusion of low molecular weight coreagents, e.g. made by suspension or emulsion polymerisation of acrylamide with crosslinker. In alternative examples, the second coreagent generating system can be contained within liposomes bearing specific binding material on their surface, e.g. those mentioned in EP specification No. 0 014 530 and references cited therein, and examples given herein below. A suitable enzyme to generate the second coreagent is for example glucose oxidase provided with glucose and oxygen , which enzyme can be for example occluded within a polyacrylamide bead which has a degree of crosslinking sufficient to prevent any appreciable diffusion of the glucose oxidase out of the bead. The occluded glucose oxidase enzyme can be provided with its substrates glucose and dissolved oxygen by for example diffusion from outside the bounded zone, e.g. by diffusion from liquid surrounding the bead or capsule. This system generates hydrogen peroxide H₂O₂ within the bead, and the H₂O₂ diffuses out freely from the bead into the surrounding liquid, where it can be used as the second coreagent. This example of a coreagent for the rest of the assay system H₂O₂ can alternatively be produced by any other convenient generating source in the bounded zone, and diffuses through the interphase or interfacial zone into the aqueous reaction zone, e.g. surrounding liquid, where the consumer reagent can for example be a suitably chosen concentration of catalase enzyme. An alternative analogous second coreagent is for example glucose 6 phosphate, which can be released for example from a gel preparation as the bounded zone which occludes a sufficient supply of glucose 6 phosphate, e.g. in solid slowly dissolving form. For this purpose the consumer reagent present outside the bounded zone can be glucose 6 phosphatase, and a corresponding enzyme label is glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase. In this case the coenzyme NADP is supplied, and the extent of its reduction can be detected in the usual e.g. spectrophotometric or fluorometric manner, and is directly related to the amount of the enzyme which has become bound to the gel surface. The glucose 6 phosphate can be provided for example in the form of a finely divided solid carried within a hydratable polymer gel, e.g., an acrylic polymer gel which is sufficiently crosslinked to exclude the consumer reagent, e.g. such a gel which has been produced by polymerisation of an acrylic comonomer mixture carrying the finely divided solid particles in suspension, in non aqueous solvent. Conversion of such beads to specific binding material of desired specificity can be achieved in any suitable way, but in particular by incorporating biotin, e.g. in the manner described below, or a hapten, and then absorbing the biotin or hapten with e.g. avidin or anti hapten conjugated to an antibody, of desired specificity. Alternative second coreagent generating systems not involving enzymes can also be chosen. For example, where hydrogen peroxide is the coreagent which it is desired to generate, the generating system can be a chemical hydrogenperoxide generating system, e.g. a photochemical system, in which the bounded zone is illuminated with light which is actinic for material which can reduce oxygen under photo activation in the presence of an electron donor, e.g. flavin mononucleotide FMN , flavin adenine dinucleotide FAD , anthraquinone, methyl viologen or 1,1 ethylene 2,2 bipyridylium in the presence of an aliphatic tertiary diamine, such as a substituted ethylene diamine, e.g. EDTA. These photochemical hydrogen peroxide generating systems include systems known Preferred embodiments of the invention are described by way of example, together with details for the preparation or procurement of the principal assay materials, as follows A polymerisable biotin derivative, the 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate ester of biotin, can be prepared by the following process Dissolve 0.5g of the biotinyl chloride in a mixture of 42.5g of 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate HEMA and 0.5g pyridine. Adjust the pH to approximately 7 by the addition of more pyridine. Stir at 20 C for two hours. Add the mixture to 400ml toluene, and then add 400 ml water. Shake, and then remove the organic layer. Add a further 400 ml water and repeat the extraction. Dry the organic layer over anhydrous magnesium sulphate. Remove toluene on a rotary evaporator, keeping the temperature less than 60 C. Store the product at 0 5 C. It contains the 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate ester of biotin biotin HEMA ester monomer in admixture with a substantial amount of HEMA. Deoxygenate by bubbling nitrogen through the mixture for fifteen minutes. Then add 3ml of an ammonium persulphate solution 0.4g ml and 8ml of a glucose oxidase solution 2mg ml, in SAB . Pour the mixture into a 500ml glass bowl containing 350ml n hexane and 0.9g SPAN 80 detergent Trade Mark . Stir the mixture with an overhead stirrer fitted with a U shaped glass stirrer contoured to the bottom and sides of the bowl. Adjust the speed to approximately 220 rpm. Stir for one minute after the addition of the monomer mixture. Then increase the speed to about 250 rpm. Add 2.2ml tetramethylethylenediamine TEMED and continue stirring for three minutes. Turn the speed back down to 220 rpm and continue for one hour. The bowl should be covered during stirring to reduce evaporation of hexane . Decant off most of the hexane, filter off the beads, and wash with a large volume of SAB. Remove any large lumps of polymer, and store in SAB with a small amount of thimerosal antimicrobial preservative at 0 5 C. Examples of beads prepared according to the above procedure have been found to have a particle size range of about 30 500 microns and to show swelling in SAB of 5.1g g and glucose oxidase activity equivalent to about 1.3 x 10 ⁴g enzyme g dry polymer . The following details refer to an assay for biotin, using among other materials avidin peroxidase conjugate. It will, however, be clear to the skilled reader that the polymer beads prepared as described above can be converted to form an immunoadsorbent of desired specificity by first adsorbing them with a conjugate of avidin or streptavidin linked in known manner e.g. by use of a known glutaraldehyde coupling technique to an appropriate antigen or antibody or specific binding analogue or specific binding competitor of an antigen or antibody of appropriate specificity. Then the desired form of immunoassay or other specific binding assay can be arranged by using the peroxidase conjugate of an appropriate specific binding agent in place of the avidin peroxidase conjugate used as described below. The format of the immunoassay can be chosen from among any of those described hereinabove, or any other suitable assay format. Materials for the performance of an example specific binding assay include Component b , the conjugate, is used in diluted admixture with an inert protein, ratio 200 400µg conjugate to 100mg protein , in this case bovine serum albumin, in order to stabilise it in the usual stock solutions and containers. An assay of biotin using these materials can be performed either in two stages or in one stage. To perform the assay in two stages, a first stage mixture can be made, comprising the following constituents per ml of reaction liquid i 50mg of bead component a ii a standard aliquot of conjugate b in a quantity in the range about 7.5 15µg which is the same for all samples, calibration standards and controls in a given assay run iii 3.75mg bovine serum albumin, diluent stabiliser, inert protein used in admixture with the stock solutions and preparations of conjugate b . The liquid in which stock solutions are made up for suspending and dissolving these components is phosphate buffered saline PBS containing per litre 8.5g NaCl, 1.07g disodium phosphate and 0.39g monosodium phosphate in purified water and iv sample liquid adjusted if possible e.g. by serial dilution to contain about 0.003 0.3µg biotin. The first stage mixture can be shaken for about 40 minutes to keep the polymer beads in suspension. Then the beads are separated, e.g. by centrifugation, and added sample by sample to respective aliquots of further reagents to make a second stage mixture containing per 2.5ml 50mg of treated beads from first stage mixture, 0.46mg catalase, 2mg ABTS, 10mg glucose, all in PBS solution. After 30 minutes incubation an aliquot of supernatant liquid is taken for absorbance measurement at 630nm against a comparison blank of PBS solution containing only the ABTS, catalase, and glucose as used in the second stage reaction mixture. The assay routine has been found to permit satisfactory assay of biotin at the levels indicated. In alternative assays, all the reagents are mixed together in a single reaction liquid the weights of reagents given above for the second stage can be scaled down to leave the same final concentrations . This enables a particularly convenient form of one stage assay which can be presented by means of appropriate combinations of stock reagents so as to minimise the number of manipulations required on the part of the user. Such an assay can be carried out for example as follows. In the following example procedure the binding reaction partners are allowed to react together before the addition of substrate and consumer enzyme catalase , but experiments have shown that this delayed addition is unnecessary the substrate and the enzyme can be added at the start. Stock solutions of avidin HRP conjugate obtainable from Vector Laboratories Trade Mark are prepared as follows Biotin solutions were 4.2 x 10 ⁴ mg ml in phosphate buffered saline PBS . All the above stock solutions are diluted to 5 ml with PBS before use. The biotin substituted beads, high biotin level are filtered and weighed out into 24 x 50 mg lots. These are divided into eight lots of three and 1 ml of solution a is added to each bead sample of one group of three, 1 ml of b to each sample of another group of three, etc. to give triplicate readings at each point . They are then put on a wrist shaker for 40 minutes. To each bead sample 1 ml catalase solution 0.46 mg ml, in PBS is added, then 1 ml ABTS dye solution 2 mg ml, in PBS and then 0.5 ml glucose solution 20 mg ml, in PBS . They are put on a wrist shaker. Thirty minutes after the glucose addition, 200 µl of supernatant is removed after having allowed the beads to settle . The optical densities are measured at 630 nm against a blank composed of 1 ml PBS 1 ml catalase solution 1 ml dye solution 0.5 ml glucose solution. Within the range of 0.6 35 nanogram tube biotin the colour development of the assay tubes was found to vary between substantially its maximum and minimum values, inversely with the biotin concentration. In this example, gentamicin is assayed by a procedure in many ways analogous to the procedure given above for Example 1. The components of an illustrative microbead assay system for the assay of gentamicin are in outline as follows further description is given below The following section describes the preparation and characterisation of H₂O₂ generating beads for the gentamicin assay and the preparation of HRP conjugates. The example bead types prepared in this way all contain active glucose oxidase but they can differ in the functional groups arrayed on their surfaces. Beads produced for use with the avidin HRP conjugate substantially as in the preceding example are given surface biotin groups, whilst beads intended for linking to amino groups on antibodies or antigens are provided with carboxyl groups through the incorporation of acrylic acid as a comonomer . The coupling of antibodies to carboxyl containing beads can be accomplished in essentially known manner by means of the N hydroxy succinimide EDC carbodiimide reaction. Beads to be used for coupling vias the amino groups of the antibody are prepared using sodium acrylate comonomer to give surface carboxyl groups, in the following modification of the procedure described above for biotin substituted beads in connexion with Example 1 . The materials used include Sodium carbonate anhydrous PBS buffer pH 7.2 Acrylic acid glacial Acrylamide and N,N¹ methylenebisacrylamide MBA , electrophoresis grade Glucose oxidase, type VII ex Sigma Ammonium persulphate Hexane fraction from petroleum SPAN 80 Trade Mark surfactant Tetramethylenethlenediamine TEMED , electrophoresis grade Thimerosal. The suspension medium is prepared by dissolving SPAN 80 0.4g in hexane 350 ml in a round bottomed glass reaction flask. The monomer solution is prepared by dissolving sodium carbonate 0.88g in PBS buffer 33.3g . To this glacial acrylic acid is slowly added 1.19g and the solution was stirred until effervescence ceases. Acrylamide 4.70g and methylenebisacrylamide 0.93g are added and allowed to dissolve. The solution is deoxygenated by bubbling with nitrogen for ten minutes. 1 ml glucose oxidase solution 15 mg ml in distilled water is dispersed in the monomer solution using the nitrogen stream to obtain good mixing. 1.5 ml ammonium persulphate solution 0.4 g ml in distilled water is added the nitrogen stream to thoroughly mix this in, over a 30 second period. The monomer mixture is poured into the warmed suspension medium 27 29 C whilst stirring with a U shaped glass stirrer at approximately 230 rpm. After 30 seconds 5.0 ml TEMED is added to the hexane and the flask is covered to minimise solvent loss through evaporation. The polymerisation is allowed to proceed for 30 minutes, then the stirrer speed turned down to approx. 120 rpm for a further 25 minutes. The stirrer is then stopped to allow the beads to settle. Most of the hexane is decanted off, and the beads are filtered and washed with PBS until free of both hexane and SPAN 80 surfactant. The beads are stored as a slurry in PBS 4 C containing approx. 0.01 w v thimerosal as preservative. The resulting beads, as made in one example test run of this procedure, were found to contain glucose oxidase activity at the level of 0.140 µg enzyme mg dry beads. Anti gentamicin antibodies are coupled to the micro beads for example as follows. Materials used include Micro beads bearing surface carboxyl groups prepared as above , 5g wet weight N hydroxy succinimide NHS , 70 mg The micro beads are washed in distilled water to remove preservatives, etc. The washed microbeads 5g, wet wt. are resuspended in 6 ml distilled water. NHS 70 mg in 5 ml distilled water is added to the suspension so formed. EDC 100 mg in 5 ml distilled water is then added, bringing the total volume to about 20 ml. The reaction mixture is roll mixed for 1 hour at room temperature activation . After 1 hour the micro beads are washed with 3 x 15 ml distilled water. The washed, activated micro beads are resuspended in 10 ml distilled water containing 3 mg anti gentamicin IgG fraction. This activated micro bead IgG reaction mixture is roll mixed overnight at 4 C to couple the antibody to the activated microbeads. The antibody coupled micro beads are then washed with 2 x 15 ml distilled water. Ethanolamine 0.3 v v in 15 ml 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer pH 9.8 is then added to the antibody coupled micro beads to neutralise block residual protein coupling sites on the beads. The reaction mixture is roll mixed for 1 hour at room temperature. After 1 hour the micro beads are washed in 1 x 15 ml distilled water, 2 x 15 ml PBS pH 7.4, 1 x 15 ml phosphate citrate buffer, pH 6.1 1 Triton, 1 x 15 ml phosphate citrate buffer, pH 6.1 and, finally they are suspended in 15 ml of phosphate citrate pH 6.1. The beads are then stored at 4 C in phosphate citrate buffer, pH 6.1. Gentamicin HRP Conjugate is prepared by a technique adapted from the description by Boersma and Streefkerk J. Immunol. Methods., 1979, HRP 10 mg is dissolved in distilled water 2 ml . Sodium m periodate 0.1 M aqueous 500 µl is then added. This reaction mixture is rolled for 25 minutes at room temperature to oxidise sugar groups on the enzyme. After 25 minutes rolling, the mixture is dialysed overnight at 4 C against 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 4.0 . The dialysed mixture is then transferred to a reaction vial with gentamicin sulphate 2.8 mg in 1M carbonate buffer pH 9.5, 1 ml . This reaction mixture is rolled for 2 hours at room temperature to couple gentamicin to HRP by Schiff base formation . After 2 hours rolling, sodium borohydride 400 µg in distilled water 100 µl is added. The reaction mixture is rolled for 2 hours at 4 C. After 2 hours rolling the mixture is trransferred to narrow bore Visking Trade Mark tubing and dialysed overnight at 4 C against 0.01 M PBS, pH 7.4. Finally, the product conjugate is stored at 4 C in a stoppered brown glass vial 5 ml capacity . Using the materials prepared above, a competitive assay for gentamicin can be carried out as follows. In this system antibodies are bound to the bead surface, and the labelled material used is gentamicin labelled with horse radish peroxidase as described above . Free gentamicin from the sample is able to compete for the antibodies bound to the bead surface. Materials used for assay include A set of tubes 2 ml Sarstedt is arranged, each containing 50 µl of antibody linked micro beads 100 ug per tube . Gentamicin standards 50 µl each are then added to give replicate tubes with 0, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 ng gentamicin per tube. Conjugate solution 50 µl diluted 1 200 is then added to each tube, followed immediately by glucose OPD substrate solution. All of the tubes are placed on a continuous mixer for 40 minutes in the dark at room temperature. After 40 minutes incubation, 125 µl aliquots are withdrawn from each tube, placed in the wells of a microtitre tray and their optical densities measured at 405 nm with a standard plate reader Uniskan Trade Mark . A calibration curve derived from this assay showed variation of colour development from substantially maximum to substantially minimum within the range 2 500 nanogram tube gentamicin, with an inverse relation between gentamicin level and colour intensity. A further useful example of an assay, based on a photochemical hydrogen peroxide generating system, is an antiglobulin test for mouse antibody raised against E.coli 0149 lipopolysaccharide. Suitable liposomes incorporating the antigen at their surface are as described in EP 0 014 530, except that the material occluded in the liposomes is a mixture of 0.01 M FMN and 0.01 M EDTA. A sandwich type antiglobulin test can be arranged using a commercially obtainable conjugate of horseradish peroxidase with sheep anti mouse immunologlobulin, by illuminating a reaction liquid sample containing all of the ingredients including the liposomes, antibody sample, antibody conjugate, catalase, and chromogenic peroxidase substate. If desired, the reaction liquids can contain a suitable dense polymeric or polysaccharide suspending agent e.g. Ficoll, Trade Mark which can be provided in a suitably chosen density of solution to eliminate the need to shake the bead suspensions. Alternatively, the beads or other forms of polymer with the properties indicated therein can be provided in a form in which they are attached to or form part of the surface of a macro solid phase carrier material such as a larger e.g. 5mm diameter bead, or a stick, peg or strip, e.g., a paper or cellulose or glass fibre or synthetic plastics material. As alternative materials to the liposomes mentioned above, polymer membranes, especially e.g. as capsules, can be used, such as for example those described in GB 1 540 461 Damon , and modified by attachment of specific binding groups. In the examples given above, a peroxidase enzyme is used as the enzyme label attached to a binding reaction partner, and hydrogen peroxide is used as reactant for the enzyme label together with a chromogenic co reactant. Among such chromogenic co reactants, besides 2,2 azino di 3 ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid ADBS , producing a green soluble product that absorbs light particularly strongly at 415 nm, other chromogens can be used, for example o dianisidine, giving a sparingly soluble yellow orange product that absorbs especially at 400 nm, 5 aminosalicylic acid, giving a brown soluble product that absorbs especially at 450 nm, dicarboxidine dihydrochloride, which gives a brown soluble product absorbing especially at 440 nm, and o phenylene diamine, giving an orange soluble product absorbing light particularly strongly at 492 nm as well as tetramethylbenzidine, which gives a blue insoluble product. Further examples of suitable chromogenic co reactants are 3 methyl 2 benzothiazolinone hydrazone 3 dimethylamino benzoic acid, giving a purple soluble product absorbing especially at 590 nm, diaminobenzidine, giving a brown insoluble product, and 4 chloro 1 naphthol, giving a blue insoluble product. Coloured insoluble products can be especially usefully applied to qualitative detection tests, for example. A fluorescent result can be achieved for example by using 3 4 hydroxyphenyl propionic acid as the co reactant. Alternatively, a luminescent coreactant can be employed. For example, in an embodiment of the test system described herein wherein a peroxide is present, luminol can be used to provide a detectable luminescence by reaction with the peroxide and peroxidase enzyme label. Among the luminescent materials that can be used as a label without requiring an enzyme label are N methylated 9 acridine carboxyl groups introduced for example by reaction of the substance to be labelled with the corresponding acid halide, followed by N methylation.
