## Description
TAPE ELECTRODEI. DESCRIPTION.Background of Prior Art In its preferred embodiments this invention is directed to medical electrodes for application to the skin.Skin electrodes are of varying types and may be used either as transmission electrodes or sensing electrodes. A wide variety of design configurations have been provided in the past for these kinds of electrodes. A desirable skin electrode is one which maintains good electrical contact with the skin and is free of localized current hot spots, For example, a prior art electrode utilizing karaya gum tends to creep on use and flatten out exposing the skin to possible direct contact with the current distribution member or lead wire. It is an object of this invention to provide electrodes in which the component contacting the skin possesses superior adhesive properties. The adhesive properties are not appreciably affected by skin moisture, allowing the electrodes to be. used for several days at a.time. It is also substantially homogeneous and creep resistant and is thus able to avoid the development of hot spots . The skin contacting component is also inherently electrically conductive, not requiring electrically conductive additives. It is a further object of this invention to provide electrodes having desirable elastic properties and wherein the skin contacting component does not foster the growth of bacteria or other micro organisms between the electrode and the skin.Brief summary of Invention Accordingly, the electrodes of this invention essentially comprise electrical lead means contacting a mixture of polymerized 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid or one of its salts with water and or an alcohol.Polymer mixtures and copolymers may also be used as described below in detail. The mixture gels and takes the form of a self supporting flexible material having adhesive properties. Additionally, it has inherent electrically conductive properties. Other constituents may optionally be included in the mixture and various components such as backing supports and differing electrical lead arrangements may be used.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of an electrode according to the invention. Figure 2 is an elevational view of the electrode of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2.Detailed Description of the Invention As previously pointed out, this invention particularly lends itself to medical electrodes of varying shapes and configurations. For exemplary purposes herein, a skin electrode 10 is shown in one of the more common rectangular configurations. Electrode 10 includes flexible, adhesive and conductive member 12 for contacting the skin. An electrical lead 14, including a conductive member 14a and an insulating sheath or covering 14b, electrically contacts member 12. In its my sot preferred form, as shown in the Fig ures, the electrode also includes an electrical current distribution member 16 which also electrically contacts electrical conductorEMI3.1 member 12. In this configuration, member 12 is referred to as a substrate. Current distribution member 16 is preferably formed of a metallic foil, such as stainless steel foil, which is readily available in very thin configuration or form such as .001 inches.Such a foil may be included in the electrode without having any substantial effect on its flexibility. Due to the adhesive nature of the substrate 12, the foil readily adheres thereto. A separate adhesive such as is described below may be used for this purpose and in some instances may be preferred. Other forms of distribution member 16 may be used, such as wire mesh, conductive cloth or the like. The preferred embodiment of the electrode as shown in the Figures also includes a support or backing 18, the chief purpose of which is to provide a protective and supportive member for the electrode. A preferred backing material is polyethylene foam. One such material is oommercially available from Fasson, Inc., a division of AveryInternational of Paynesville, Ohio, under the trade desigEMI3.2 NED 416. The material is a four pound density crosspolyethylene foam coated with a tacky adhesive material of an acrylic type. The foam is 1 16th of an inch thick. However, various thicknesses may be used. The foam need not be coated with the adhesive since it will in most instances, readily adhere to substrate 12 which, as previously pointed out, is adhesive itself.However, the preferred embodiment makes use of the adhesive coated foam, the stainless steel foil current distribution member 16 and the substrate member 12. The substrate member may be of various thicknesses, about .025 to .250 inches being preferred. Greater thicknesses may be used as dimension is not critical as long as resistance is not excessive for the particular use involved. In operation and use, electrode 10 is applied with conductive substrate 12 in dIrect contact with the skin. The adhesive properties of substrate 12 eliminate the need for separate adhesive tape or any other separate securing measures to hold electrode 10 in continuous contact with the skin. Upon prolonged exposure or use, the substrate may be wiped with water or alcohol to increase its adhesiveness. Electrical signals either to or from the skin are conducted through substrate member 12 and the electrical lead means, such as the current distribution member 16 and wire 14, 14 shown in the Figures. The composition of conductive member 12 is unique to the invention. As previously stated, it includes polymerized 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid or a soluble salt thereof mixed with water and or an alcohol, preferably glycerol or propylene glycol, in flexible sheetlike form. Copolymers of it may also be used and it may be blended with additional polymeric thickeners and the like.Other alcohols may be used too, The components are provided in such relative amounts as to form a flexible, selfsupporting material which has adhesive properties and is electrically conductive. The 2 acrylamido 2 meth lpropanesul fonic acid or its soluble salt may be incorporated into the mixture in the monomer form and then polymerized. Alternatively, the polymerized acid or its soluble polymerized salt may be incorporated into the mixture directly. Both approaches are illustrated in the examples below. In the principal preferred embodiments, the member 12 is a sheet of polymerized material formed from 2acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid monomer purchased from The Lubrizol Corporation and sold under the tradenameAMPS, a registered trademark. The monomer upon being dissolved in water, is polymerized to attain a sheet like form which is flexible, conductive and adhesive. It is preferred that the monomer be refined grade as per the Lubrizol Process For The Manufacture of Refined AMPS datedDecember 14, 1976. Briefly, refined monomer is made by dissolving reaction grade monomer in methanol and recrystal lizing it. Examples 1 9 are of this type. The term polymer as used hereinbelow refers to polymers of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid or its soluble salts and, where appropriate, it is further characterized by acid or salt for additional specificity. The term monomer herein refers to the monomeric form of the compounds. EXAMPLE 1 50 g. of the commercially available acid monomer were dissolved in 50 g. of distilled water. The mixture was purged with nitrogen for about 10 minutes before adding the initiators. Initiator was added. The Lubrizol Corp.recommends ferrous sulfate and hydrogen peroxide in small amounts eg., .01 g. ferrous sulfate heptahydrate and .25 g.hydrogen peroxide in a .05 solution, which was used in this example. Upon addition of the initiator, the mixture was poured into a tray in an enclosed nitrogen atmosphere to form a rectangular sheet having a thickness of about .125 inches. .25 inch thick sheets have also been prepared in this way. After pouring, the mixture rapidly gelled to a flexible material with adhesive conductive qualities. EXAMPLE 2 25g. of the acid monomer were dissolved in 25 ml.of deionized water. 4.24 g. of ammonium hydroxide were then dissolved in this mixture. The solution was purged with nitrogen for about 10 minutes and polymerization initiator was then added. The initiator was 1 ml. of a .38 g. 100 ml. solution of potassium bisulfite, 1 ml. of a .38 g. l00 ml. solution of potassium persulfate and 1 ml. of a .24 g. 100 ml. solution of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate.15 seconds was allowed for mixing then the mixture was poured into a mold under a nitrogen atmosphere to form the sheet material. The mixture rapidly gelled as in Example 1. EXAMPLE 3 Same as Example 2 except 4.50 g. of lithium carbonate were substituted for the ammonium hydroxide. The resistance of the sheet was 7.5 kilo ohms for a sheet sampie 1.5 X 1 X .125 inches. EXAMP1 4 Same as Example 2 except 8.36 g. of potassium carbonate were substituted for the ammonium hydroxide. The resistance of the sheet was 2.1 kilo ohms for a sheet sample 1.5 X 1 X .125 inches. , EXAMPLE 5 Same as Example 2 except 10.16 g. of sodium bicarbonate were substituted for the ammonium hydroxide. The resistance of the sheet was 2.1 kilo ohms for a sheet sample 1.5 X 1 X .125 inches. EXAMPLE 6 Another example of polymerizing the monomer and forming the sheet simultaneously was provided by mixing 50 g. of the monomer with 35 ml. of distilled water and 15 ml. of glycerol. The primary purpose of the addition of an alcohol such as glycerol is to retard drying of the polymerized sheet. The mixture was purged with nitrogen by bubbling.about 10 minutes to substantially remove oxygen.Initiator in the form of 1 ml. of a .15 hydrogen peroxide solution was added. The mixture was then poured onto release paper a silicone coated paper under a nitrogen atmosphere and it very quickly gelled to be self supporting.It was then placed in an oven at 50 or for two hours to remove sur face moisture. When placed in the oven overnight at 500C,, the material lost substantial tackiness. However, the surface of the material which was against the release paper retained good adhesive properties. EXAMPLE 7 The same procedure was used as in Example 6 except that 10 ml. of glycerol and 40 ml. of water were used.The resulting sheet was more firm than that of Example 6. EXAMPLE 8 Another sheet electrode was prepared as in Example 1. After polymerization, the electrode surface was wiped with glycerol and left exposed to ambient environment.Wiping was found to retard drying for at least 7 days.However, storage in sealed plastic bags was also found to be effective in preventing drying of the polymer sheet. EXAMPLE 9 Eight sheet like pads of polymerized material were prepared as in Example 1 except the initiator used was 1 ml. of a. .38 g. 100 .ml solution of potassium bisulfite, 1 ml of a .38 g. 100 ml solution of potassium persulfate and 1 ml of a .24 g. 100 ml solution of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate. Each pad was about 4.5 X 7 X 0.125 inches in size. They were tested for skin irritation on both laboratory animals and humans with no primary skin irritation resulting. The typical electrical resistivity of the polymerized sheet prepared and described in Examples 1 and 6 9 was about 3 X 102 ohm cm. and the sheet was substantially colorless and substantially transparent in appearance. The monomer and its salts may be polymerized in aqueous solutions by common water soluble radical initiators or redox systems. It can also be polymerized in emulsion, rather than in solution, using common vinyl polymerization techniques. The molecular weight of the polymer may be varied by changing the initiator concentration, the monomer concentration, the temperature or by the use of a chain transfer agent such as a mercaptan. The molecular weight of the polymer formed for use herein is not critical so long as it is high enough to form a self supporting gel. The higher the molecular weight, the easier the material is to handle and the better. its performance, such as resistance to creep and dehydration. Since the polymer itself ie., poly 2 acrylamido2 methylpropanesulfonic acid and many of its polymerized salts are water soluble, the substrate member may also be prepared by dissolving already formed polymer in water or other suitable solvents such as alcohols and forming sheet or film of desired thickness by compression forming or by solution casting and evaporating. Additional constituents may be mixed with the polymer in such preparations also. Examples of such mixtures or blends are included below. Sheets of each were prepared and tested. The mixtures, in the amounts indicated below, were stirred together, placed between two pieces of mylar, pressed to desired thickness to form sheet or film, and dried overnight in an oven at 500C.
