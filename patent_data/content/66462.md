# PARTITIONS HAVING RACEWAYS FOR COMMUNICATION CABLES

## Abstract
A movable room divider or partition having a panel section 11 supported on feet 14 is provided with a low profile raceway 2 for communication cables and other casual wiring. The raceway comprises a U shaped channel 3 connected with the partition section, and extending along and beneath the base of the panel section. The channel has a dual durometer construction with a rigid web 5 for supporting the cables, and a pair of upstanding flanges 7 with free edges disposed adjacent the partition base to enclose the raceway. At least one of the flanges is resiliently flexible to permit localized, elastic deformation of the flange for inserting and withdrawing the cables from the raceway.
