# Reservoir height extender for lash adjuster assembly.

## Abstract
A resevoir height extender for a lash adjuster assembly 150 comprising an inverted hollow insert member 60 disposed in fluid resevoir chamber 42 within a plunger member 40 of assembly 150 . Plunger member 40 is reciprocally moveable within a bore 38 of a body member 36 having a first fluid passageway 48 adapted to receive fluid from a fluid source and which communicates with a second fluid passageway 46 in plunger member 40 adapted to enable the fluid to flow into fluid resevoir chamber 42 . Insert member 60 is displaced from a wall of plunger member 40 surrounding chamber 42 for a distance sufficient to provide a third fluid passageway 68 therebetween which communicates between passageway 46 and an opening 64 through insert member 60 that is higher than passageway 46 and which enables a substantial increase in the level of fluid within resevoir chamber 42 .
