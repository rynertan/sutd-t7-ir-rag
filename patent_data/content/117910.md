# Apparatus for signal evaluation by accumulation at one rate and releasing and testing at a slower rate.

## Abstract
Method and means for evaluating the quality of audio and or video transfer characteristics of a device upon which, or through which, audio and or video information is con tained, or passes, respectively. Both method and apparatus concern the evaluation of the quality of information transfer in the recording and playing back of a recording medium or in the transferring of audio and or video information through an information handling device referred to as a throughput device. Unit evaluation is accomplished by establishing an input signal of known content, measuring selected para meters of selected parts of the input signal, feeding the input signal to the unit under test, measuring the parameters of parts of the output signal from the unit under test corres ponding to the same selected parts of the input signal, and comparing the selected parameters of the input signal with the corresponding parameters of the output signal. Whether monitoring the quality of the signal transfer characteristics of a throughput device, a magnetic tape containing program material, or a video disc, master disc or replica, a signature is created for the unit under test, and subsequent analysis of the unit as it progresses along a production line or of a copy made on the same or alternate recording medium results in a second signature which is compared against the first signature to make a determination as to the quality of the signal handling or transfer characteristics of the unit. In this manner, out of tolerance conditions can be automatically detected, thereby eliminating subjectivity and providing consistency in the quality level of device testing.
