# METHOD OF PRODUCING TRANSPARENT POLYCRYSTALLINE ZNS BODY

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method of producing a very hard transparent polycrystalline ZnS body which is useful for optical materials for use in infrared instruments. The method of the invention comprises the hot isostatic pressing of a polycrystalline ZnS body, obtained by a chemi cal vapour deposition method, for 1 hour or more at tem peratures higher than 1,050 C and pressures of 500 atm or more.
