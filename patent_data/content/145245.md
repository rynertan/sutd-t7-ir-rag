## Description
The present invention relates to the core of a noise filter comprised of amorphous alloy. More particularly, it relates to the core of a noise filter for eliminating pulse noise, the noise filter comprising a core and a pair of windings for generating magnetic fluxes which offset each other. Description of the Prior Art 1 Soft Magnetic Materials Conventionally, ferrite is used as the core of a noise filter. Ferrite has an excellent permeability characteristic but its saturation flux density is low. Silicon steels are also conventionally used as the core of a noise filter. Silicon steels have a high permeability at a low frequency and a high magnetic flux density. However, the frequency characteristic of the permeability is not excellent. In addition, compacted iron powder is conventionally used as the core of a noise filter. Compacted iron powder has a high saturation density but its permeability is low. Amorphous alloys can be excellent magnetic materials because of their disordered structure and a watt loss as low as one third that of conventional crystalline alloys. Therefore, as is well known, enormous efforts have been made to investigate the thermally stable soft magnetic properties, such as a high residual flux density, a high saturation flux density, and a low watt loss of amorphous alloy compositions. Such soft magnetic properties can usually be attained when the BH curve has a rectangular shape and is longitudinally elongated, i.e., when the coercive force is low the magnetization at a predetermined magnetic field is high. EP A 0119432 discloses amorphous alloys for electromagnetic devices, particularly transformers. An iron based, boron, silicon, carbon and chromium containing magnetic alloy is described having at least 85 percent of its structure in the form of an amorphous metal matrix which is annealed at a temperature and for a time sufficient to induce precipitation therein of discrete particles of its constituents and to form an oxide layer on the surface of the matrix. The resulting alloy is claimed to have decreased high frequency core losses and increased low field permeability and is said to be particularly suited for high frequency applications. This document constitutes prior art but only as regards novelty and not inventive step under Article 54 3 EPC. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 54 148122 discloses an amorphous alloy which contains from 80 to 84 atomic of iron, from 12 to 15 atomic of boron, and from 1 to 8 atomic of silicon and which exhibits a high saturation flux density, a high ductility, and a high temperature stability. United States Patent No. 4,217,315 illustrates the composition of an Fe B Si based amorphous alloy by a curved area and describes an Fe₈₁B₁₃.₃ ₁₅.₇ Si₃ ₅ composition as a typical one which has a high saturation magnetization, a high cyrstallization temperature, and a low coercive force and is thus excellent for use as a motor and a transformer. United States Patent No. 4,219,355 discloses that in an Fe Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 116750,corresponding to EP A 55327,discloses that in an Fe Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 137451 discloses that an amorphous alloy which consists of from 77 to 80 atomic of iron, from 12 to 16 atomic of boron, and from 5 to 10 atomic of silicon exhibits the following properties 15 kG or more of a saturation magnetization, approximately 3.2A m 0.04 Oe or less of a coercive force, and 0.22 W kg 0.1W pound of watt loss 1.26T 12.6 kG 60 Hz . Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58 34162 discloses that an amorphous alloy which consists of from 78 to 82 atomic of iron, from 8 to 14 atomic of boron, from 5 to 15 atomic of silicon, and up to 1.5 atomic of carbon has an anti magnetic aging property and good watt loss and magnetic flux density. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58 42751 discloses that in an amorphous alloy which consists of from 77 to 79 atomic of iron, from 8 to 12 atomic of silicon, from 9 to 11 atomic of boron, and from 1 to 3 atomic of carbon, the secular change of magnetic properties is very small. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 56 127749 discloses that when x is from 4 to 9.5 atomic and a is from 82 to 86 atomic in an Fe Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 190304 discloses that in the Fe In the above described prior art, most of the investigations are directed to finding the appropriate content ranges of Fe, B, Si, and C while setting the Fe content at around approximately 80 atomic . In these prior arts, no composition which can exhibit excellent properties as the core of a noise filter can be found except for Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 116750, in which appropriate B and Si contents at an Fe content of 75 atomic are investigated, and except for Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 190304, in which the enhancement of the squareness ratio due to Mo is reported. However, since in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 116750 the amorphous alloy is subjected to a heat treatment under a magnetic field so as to provide a square and longitudinally long BH curve, properties suitable for a core of a noise filter cannot be obtained. Proc. 4th Int. Conf. on Rapidly Quenched Metals Sendai, 1981 pp1035 1038 reprots a study of the permeability change depending upon the frequency regarding the Fe₀.₇₆B₀.₁₄Si₀.₁₀ ₉₈ Be,C,Al,Co,Ni,Cr,Nb ₂ and Fe Disclosed in this study is an abnormal phenomenon in which the permeability drastically decreases at a certain frequency, e.g., in the vicinity of 50 kHz, by approximately 20 percent. The report also discloses that this abnormal decrease in the permeability is attributable to a magnetomechanical resonance, and is mainly influenced by the magnetostriction that is, the abnormal decrease in the permeability is most remarkable in amorphous alloys having a large magnetostriction. 2 Noise Filter The noise filter may be referred to as a two line power filter for digital equipment, such as in USP No. 3,996,537, or a power supply filter for noise suppression, such as in USP No. 3,683,271. The prior art of a noise filter is described with reference to Fig. 1. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a circuit of a noise filter Fig. 2 is a graph illustrating the relationship between the noise input voltage and the noise output voltage Fig. 3 is a diagram showing the range of A, B, and C components according to the present invention Fig. 4 is a graph illustrating the permeability and permeability changes depending upon applied magnetic field Fig. 5 is a ternary diagram of amorphous alloys and, Fig. 6 is a graph illustrating a relationship between the µ₂ after demagnetization and µ₂ after pulse deterioration or the pulse deterioration percentage Referring to Fig. 1, the noise filter 1 comprises the core 1A and a pair of windings 2A and 2B. The alternating current indicated by AC 100 V is applied to the noise filter and generates magnetic fluxes when it is conducted through the windings 2A and 2B. The sum of the magnetic fluxes produced by the windings 2A and 2B is zero. A capacitor 3 and capacitors 4A and 4B are connected between the windings 2A and 2B. The capacitors 4A and 4B are connected to each other and are grounded at the connecting point thereof. The relationship between the noise input voltage and the noise output voltage is shown in Fig. 2. As is apparent from Fig. 2, the noise output voltage abruptly increases when the noise input voltage exceeds a critical value. The reason for this is because the core 1A Fig. 1 of the noise filter is magnetically saturated, and when such an abrupt increase in the noise output voltage occurs, the noise filter does not function. The curve shown in Fig. 2 has in the low noise output range an inclination which is determined by the inductance of the noise filter 1 Fig. 1 , i.e., the permeability of the core 1A. The inclination is lessened in accordance with an increase in permeability. The noise input voltage, at which the curve shown in Fig. 2 abruptly increases, is determined by the saturation flux density of the core 1A. Therefore, the core of a noise filter must have a high permeability and a high saturation flux density. In addition, when a noise filter is used for filtering noise of a high frequency voltage, the frequency characteristic of the permeability must be excellent. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 56 46l6 discloses a core of a noise filter which consists of an essentially completely amorphous alloy. This core is remarkably improved over the conventional ones, especially when it is used for filtering a high noise voltage. However, it is insufficient for suppressing a high voltage noise pulse of 1,000 V or more generated for 1 µsec or more. Such a noise pulse is frequently superimposed on the current of a power line or power circuit. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 24519 discloses a core of a noise filter which consists of a magnetic amorphous alloy which partially contains precipitated crystals. The core was invented by the present inventors, who discovered that when precipitated cyrstals are present in an amorphous alloy the core can effectively suppress a high voltage noise pulse. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 57 24518 specifies the BH curve of an amorphous alloy for use as a noise filter. More in detail, as is noted hereinabove with refernce to Figs. 1 and 2, a high inductance for a high permeability of the core of a noise filter usually results in a decrease in the noise output voltage. However, in the case of a square and longitudinally long BH curve which is obtained by increasing the permeability, a high voltage noise pulse cannot be eliminated. Therefore, in this publication the BH curve is specified to have a slanted shape in terms of 0.2T αµρ B₂ αµρ 0.7 Bs T 2,000 G αµρ B₂ αµρ 0.7 Bs G , wherein B₂ is the magnetic flux density at a magnetization of 160A m 2 Oe and 50 kHz and Bs is the saturation flux density. In this publication, Fe₇₆Co₄B₁₈.₉Si₂.₁, Fe₇₈.₄Ni₁.₆B₁₂Si₈ , Fe₆₂.₄Ni₁₆Mo₁.₆B₁₆Si₄ , and the like are mentioned as amorphous alloys. Japanese Patent Application No. 56 l85201, corresponding to Unexamined Patent Publication No. 58 87803, discloses that an amorphous alloy which has a specified BH curve in terms of µi initial permeability 2,000 5,000, Br αµρ 0.3T 3kG , B₂ 0.6 0.9T 6 9 kG , an B Preferable magnetic properties of the core of a noise filter are different from those of a core of a conventional transformer, an electric motor, or the like in the following respects. In the core of a noise filter, the BH curve should be slanted, i.e., a constant permeability characteristic or an unchanged permeability µ, depending upon the magnetic field, and a not very high residual flux density Br. Such BH curve is undesirable for the core of a transformer, an electric motor, or the like. Presumably, the properties required for the noise filter can be obtained by adjusting the composition of the amorhous alloy to have zero magnetostriction, since the above described abnormal decrease in the permeability, which is undesirable for the core of a noise filter, can be avoided by the zero magnetostrictive composition, according to the report Proc. ... Rapid Quench Metal. In the Co based amorphous alloy having zero magnetostriction, the properties other than the magnetostriction especially the magnetic flux density, are poor, and further, the magnetic properties exhibit a great secular change. This makes the zero magnetostrictive alloy inappropriate for the core of a noise filter. It is an object of the present invention to provide an amorphous alloy which can prevent deterioration of the properties of the core of a noise filter, particularly a pulse resistance deterioration, which deterioration may occur in a known noise filter core composed of, for example, approximately 80 of Fe and, occasionally, Co or Ni, the balance being B and or Si. Pulse resistance deterioration, discovered by the present inventors, is a phenomenon in which a high volt age noise pulse can be eliminated as desired the first time a noise filter is used but cannot be eliminated at subsequent times the noise filter is used. The core of a noise filter according to the present invention comprises a coiled thin strip of an amorphous magnetic alloy which essentially consists of an A component which is Fe or Fe together with at least one transition metal element, a B component which is at least one selected from the group consisting of Si and Al, and a C component which is at least one selected from the group consisting of B, C, and P, contains the A, B, and C elements in an amount falling on or within curve X shown in Fig. 3, and exhibits a permeability µ₂ of from approximately 2,000 to approximately 5,000, i.e., a permeability measured at 100 kHz and a magnetic field of 0.16A m 2 mOe ,a 0.3T 3 kG or less of a residual flux density Br determined on a BH curve at a frequency of 2 kHz and a maximum applied a magnetic field of 160A m 2 Oe , and from 0.6 to 0.9T 6 kG to 9 kG of a magnetic flux density B₂ , i.e., a magnetic flux density at 160A m 2 Oe . The composition of this amorphous magnetic alloy is hereinafter referred to as the first composition. An amorphous magnetic alloy having the first composition has a low pulse resistance deterioration. The core of a noise filter according to the present invention comprises a coiled thin strip of an amorphous magnetic alloy which essentially consists of an A component which is Fe or Fe together with at least one transition metal element, a B component which is at least one selected from the group consisting of Si and Al, and a C component which is at least one selected from the group consisting of B, C, and P, contains the A, B, and C elements is an amount falling on or within curve Y and falling outside the curve X shown in Fig. 3, and exhibits a permeability µ₂ of approximately 4,000 or more, i.e., a permeability measured at 100 kHz and a magnetic field of 0.16A m 2 mOe ,a 0.3T 3 kG or less of a residual flux density Br determined on a BH curve at a frequency of 2 kHz and a maximum applied a magnetic field of 160A m 2 Oe , and from 0.5 to 1.1T 5 kG to 11 kG of a magnetic flux density B₂ , i.e., a magnetic flux density at 2 Oe. The composition of this amorphous magnetic alloy is hereinafter referred to as the second composition. An amorphous magnetic alloy having the second composition has a low pulse resistance deterioration and a high permeability. Pulse resistance deterioration is not quantitatively determined in the industrial standards of inductors or the like. The VDE 0565 Teil 3.3.6 inductance 3.6.2 of West Germany is an industrial standard which specifies general inductors, and in this standard it is mentioned that when current is supplied to a rod core or a choke coil made of a dust core, the variation in inductance from the nominal value must be 20 or less. This variation can undoubtedly be satisfied according to the first and second compositions. The pulse resistance deterioration percentage is defined herein by the euation Prior to defining the pulse resistance deterioration percentage, the present inventors manufactured amorphous alloy cores in a toroidal form 31 mm in outer diameter, 19 mm in inner diamter and 8 mm in height, applied a magnetic field or 1600 A m 20 Oe or less to them, demagnetized them, and measured the following permeability changes The present inventors obtained the results shown in Fig. 4. As is apparent from Fig. 4, the reduction in permeability µe is the greatest at 320 A m 4 Oe of the applied magnetic field. That is, when a mangetic field of 320 A m 4 Oe is applied to the amorphous alloy cores, the permeability µe is reduced by approximately 30 compared with the permeability µe before application of the magnetic field, i.e., the permeability µe which an amorphous alloy primarily exhibits. This means that a high voltage noise pulse, which can ordinarily be primarily eliminated, may not be able to be eliminated since the ability to eliminate noise decreases by approximately 30 when an extraneous noise which generates a magnetic field or 320A m 4 Oe is applied to a core. Based on the results obtained by the present inventors, the pulse resistance deterioration percentage is determined as above. By controlling the pulse resistance deterioration percentage, it is possible to control the most serious pulse resistance deterioration which can possibly occur in cores. When the pulse resistance deterioration percentage is appropriately controlled, pulse resistance deterioration which may occur at a magnetic field higher than 320A m 4 Oe can be controlled. In addition, the permeability µ₂ represents the noise pulse suppression characteristics of a core to which a magnetic field higher than 0.16A m 2 mOe is applied due to a noise pulse voltage. Previously, there have been no quantitative methods for evaluating deterioration in pulse suppression, presumably because the inherent unforeseeable variation of a noise pulse, i.e., a great noise pulse voltage variation and plus or minus charge variation, hindered the development of such quantitative methods. In the present invention, the permeability is one of the important factors. However, since the permeability of amorphous alloys is structure sensitive, accurate measurement thereof is not always easy. In the experiments carried out by the present inventors, the permeability was measured as accurately as possible using a 4274 tester of HP corporation. However, measurement of the permeability can involve a 5 error at the maximum. The amorphous magnetic alloy according to the present invention is essentially amorphous. It may, however, optionally contain precipitated fine crystals in a minor amount. Precipitated fine crystals in the amorphous magentic alloy cause almost no change of the saturation flux density B The second composition, in which Fe of the first composition is partly replaced with Mo preferably in an amount of 3 or more, attains a pulse resistance deterioration equivalent or superior to that of the first composition, where the contents of A, B, and C components are outside the curve X shown in Fig. 3. An effect of Mo discovered by the present inventors is described with reference to Table 1. Table 1 shows the properties of the amorphous alloy having an Fe Mo is more effective for the properties of amorphous alloy for the noise filter, than are the other additives, such as Nb, Cr, and or the like, disclosed in the first composition, as is now described with reference to Table 2. In Table 2, Fe of the fundamental composition Fe₇₆Si₆B₁₈ is partly replaced with the components shown therein. The upper, middle, and lower values of the replaced composition indicate µ₂ after demagnetization , µ₂ after the pulse deterioration , and the pulse resistance deterioration percentage, respectively. The Fe₇₆Si₆B₁₈ composition has the following properties As is apparent from Table 2, Mo drastically enhances µ₂ after demagnetization and after pulse deterioration while maintaining the pulse deterioration percentage at 20 . W and Mo do not virtually change these properties. Ni impairs all of these properties. The other elements improve only either the µ₂ after demagnetization and after pulse deterioration or the pulse resistance deterioration percentage. Incidentally, if Ti is included in an amount of 1 and W in an amount of 3 , the production of an amorphous alloy ribbon is impossible. The first composition is now described. The A component is Fe or Fe and at least one transition metal element. The at least one transition metal element is selected from the 4s transition elements Sc Zn , the 5s transition elements Y Cd , the 6s transition elements La Hg , and elements having atomic numbers equal to or greater than Ac and may be Co, Ni, Cr, Cu, Mo, Nb, Ti, W, V, Zr, Ta, Y or a rare earth element. M is preferably Mn, Cr, Mo, Nb, Ni, or Co, more preferably Mn. When Hi, Co, and Fe are used as M, Ni and Co may be approximately 20 or less based on M. When, in addition to one or more of Ni, Co, and Fe, the other elements are used as M, their amount is usually approximately 5 atomic or less. The B component is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Si and Al. The content of Al is preferably 10 atomic or less based on the total content of Si and Al. The C component is at least one element selected from the group consisting of B, C, and P. The content of C is preferably 20 atomic or less based on the total of B, C, and P, and the content of P is preferably 5 or less based on the total of B, C, and P. In addition to the A, B, and C components, at least one element selected from the group consisting of Be, Ge, Sb, and In may be contained in the first composition since such element does not impede the effects of the present invention. If the composition of an amorphous alloy is on or within the curve X, the soft magnetic properties are somewhat inferior to those outside the curve X but not only can a high voltage noise pulse be effectively eliminated but also pulse resistance deterioration is not appreciable. When the A, B, and C components are located on or within the four sided region formed by connecting 73, 9, 18 , 73, 12, 15 , 76, 9, 15 , and 76, 6, 18 expressed by the ternary ordinate in atomic , pulse resistance deterioration is very small. The magnetic properties of the amorphous alloy having the first composition are now described. If the permeability µ₂ is less than approximately 2,000, the inductance of the core of a noise filter is low so that the noise output voltage is disadvantageously high. On the other hand, if the permeability µ₂ is more than approximately 5,000, the BH curve markedly tends to saturate at low pulse voltage, with the result that a high voltage noise pulse cannot be eliminated. The residual flux density Br should be as low as possible. If the residual flux density Br is more than 0.3 T 3 kG , the constant permeability characteristic is lost and the compositional range of the amorphous alloy, in which the eliminating ratio of pulse voltage is high, tends to be disadvantageously narrowed. In an embodiment of the present invention the first composition , the pulse resistance deterioration percentage is 10 or less. In another embodiment, in which the A, B, and C components are appropriately selected within the curve X, the pulse resistance deterioration percentage is 5 or less. Referring to Fig. 5, the range of the first composition is denoted by curve X in the ternary diagram. Curves Y and Z indicate compositions having a pulse resistance deterioration percentage of 20 and 30 , respectively. If the content of the A component is less than 70 atomic , vitrification of an alloy which consists of the A, 5, and C components becomes difficult. Curves U, V, and W indicate compositions having, after demagnetization, a permeability of 10,000, 7,500, and 5,000, respectively, measured at 100 kHz. The permeability measured at 25 kHz is the highest within the curve U. The compositional range within the curve U is almost coincident with that where the permeability µ₂ is the highest. As will be understood from the descriptions with reference to Fig. 5, the content range of the A, B, and C components where the pulse resistance deterioration percentage is low is not coincident with that where the permeabilities are the highest. Curve S in Fig. 5 indicates the amounts of the A, B, and C components, at which amounts the saturation flux density measured at 2 kHz of alternating current and 800 A m 10 Oe of magnetization force becomes approximately 15 kG. When the amounts of the A, B, and C components are on the right hand side of the curve S on the iron rich side , the above mentioned saturation flux density becomes high. Therefore, the amounts of the A, B, and C components indicated by the curve X according to the present invention are such that the above mentioned saturation flux density B A preferable ratio of crystals to glass glass crystals is usually 50 or less regarding the first composition. The second composition is now explained. The A component is Fe and Mo or Fe plus Mo and at least one transition metal element selected from the 4s transition elements Sc Zn , the 5s transition elements Y Cd , the 6s transition elements La Hg . The Mo and the at least one transition element are hereinafter referred to as the M. The M other than Mo is preferably Co, Ni, Cr, Cu, Nb, Ti, W, V, Zr, Ta, Y or a rare earth element. Ni and Co of the M components can be contained in the second composition in an amount up to approximately 20 atomic based on Fe. The other M components except for Mo can be contained in the second composition in an amount up to approximately 5 based on Fe. M is preferably V, Mn, Cr, Nb, Ni, or Co, more preferably Mn, V, or Nb. The B component is at least one element selected from the group consisting of Si and Al. The content of Al is preferably 10 atomic or less based on the total content of Si and Al. The C component is at least one element selected from the group consisting of B, C, and P. The content of C is preferably 20 atomic or less based on the total of B, C, and P, and the content of P is preferably 5 or less based on the total of B, C, and P. When the A, B, and C components fall on or within the curve y₁ shown in Fig. 3, the µ₂ after demagnetization of 5000 or more µ₂ 5000 is obtained. When the A component is 80 or more, the crystallization temperature becomes low, and the secular change of permeability is seriously increased. A preferred content of the A component is less than 80 . In addition when the A, B, and C components fall on or within the curve y₂ shown in Fig. 3, the µ₂ after demagnetization of 6000 or more µ₂ 6000 can be obtained. The A, B, and C components are in an amount falling on or within the curve 3 shown in Fig. 3, because, in amounts outside the curve 3, the pulse deterioration resistance is impaired and µ₂ 4000 is occasionally not attained. The permeability µ₂ , the residual flux density Br , and the magnetic flux density B₂ are determined in the second composition so as to provide the core of a noise filter which can effectively eliminate a high voltage pulse, as specifically described hereinafter. When the permeability µ₂ is less than approximately 4000, the inductance of the core of a noise filter becomes too low to attain a high attenuation of noise or a low noise output voltage. The lower the residual flux density Br , the more advantageous are the characteristics of the core of a noise filter obtained. In other words, when the A, B, and C components are outside the curve Y, the magnetic properties, such as a high magnetic flux density and low core loss required for the soft magnetic material, can be attained, since the conventional amorphous soft magnetic material having the Fe amount of around 80 do have such properties, but the pulse resistance is seriously impaired. The amount of A, B, and C components, which is indicated by the overlapping curves X and Y, is not included in the fourth composition, since the permeability µ₂ is generally low, e.g., approximately 3000. When the residual flux density Br exceeds 0.3T 3 kG Br 3 kG , the constant characteristic of permeability disadvantageously tends to be lost, with the result that, an efficient pulse voltage elimination, which is attained at the constant permeability, is restricted. When the magnetic flux density B₂ is less than 5 kG , the permissible input voltage of noise disadvantageously becomes low. On the other hand, when the magnetic flux density B₂ is more than 11 kG, the BH curve tends to have a non linear portion, i.e., the permeability tends to become inconstant, and the permissible input voltage of noise becomes low. This means that steep increase of the curve shown in Fig. 2 occurs at a low input voltage. In order to investigate whether or not the decrease in the pulse resistance deterioration percentage due to Mo is attributable to a decrease in the magnetomechanical resonance, the present inventors measured the magnetostriction of the amorphous alloys shown in Table 3. The magnetostriction amount was not essentially changed by the addition of Mo. In addition, the squareness ratio of the alloys according to the present invention was measured. This was less than 50 , and usually 20 or less. It is therefore not believed that Mo is effective for enhancing the squareness ratio of the alloys according to the present invention. Furthermore, it was discovered that Co, Ti, and W caused change in the magnetostriction amount. Neither the squareness ratio nor the magnetostriction are attributable to the low pulse resistance deterioration percentage. Trial investigations from view points other than those discovered above could not clarify which one of the physical properties is attributable to the low pulse resistance deterioration percentage. During the heat treatment of the completely amorphous alloy, a small amount of the fine crystals may be precipitated depending upon the temperature and time of the heat treatment. The fine crystals precipitated in the amorphous alloy at a minor amount are detected by the following procedure. A thin strip of the amorphous alloy is subjected to ion etching or electrolytic polishing to reduce its thickness to 50 nm or less. The thin strip is then observed by a transmission type electron microscope under the conditions of an accelerated voltage of 100 200 kV and magnification of 10,000 to 100,000. The presence and quantity of precipitated fine crystals can be determined by contrast. Where the fine crystals are precipitated in the amorphous alloy of the second composition, they are 3 by area or less, usually 0.5 by area or less. A condition of the heat treatment for precipitating the fine crystals is explained with reference to Table 4. The amorphous alloy subjected to the heat treatment is Fe₇₅Mo₅Si₁₂B₈ , and under the conditions Nos. 3 through 7, the properties according to the present invention are attained. The precipitation of fine crystals causes virtually no change in the saturation flux density B The Fe₇₃Mo₅Si₉B₁₃ amorphous alloy the second composition was subjected to various heat treatments to change the µ₂ after demagnetization . The influence of the µ₂ after demagnetization upon the µ₂ after pulse deterioration and the pulse resistance deterioration percentage was investigated. The results are shown in Fig. 6. As is apparent from Fig. 6, the µ₂ after pulse deterioration lies slightly lower than the µ₂ after demagnetization µ₂ after pulse deterioration line when the µ₂ after demagnetization is approximately 5000 or less. The µ₂ after pulse deterioration lies far below this line, and the pulse deterioration percentage is drastically decreased, when the µ₂ after demagnetization is more than approximately 5500. Such a tendency as shown in Fig. 6 is present in the amorphous alloy having the second composition but is mitigated due to Mo as compared with the amorphous alloy which is free of Mo. The core may be disposed in a nonmagnetic resin case, a nonmagnetic or magnetic metal case or a ceramic case. The thin strip of an amorphous alloy can have a thickness of from approximately 10 µm to 100 µm, preferably from 10 µm to 50 µm, and a width of from 0.1 cm to 50 cm. One end of the coiled thin strip may be fixed to another part of the strip by any appropriate means, such as bonding, welding, taping, or caulking, and insulating material may be sandwiched between the opposed surface parts of the coiled thin strip. A heat treatment for precipitating fine crystals may be carried out in the ambient air, an inert gas, or a non oxidizing atmosphere. This heat treatment has also a purpose of stress relief annealing of the coiled thin strip of an amorphous magnetic alloy. The present invention is hereinafter described with regard to examples. Amorphous magnetic alloy thin strips 18 µm thick and 8 mm wide were produced by a known single roll method, were wound as cores, and were heat treated. The properties of the heat treated cores were measured. These properties and the compositions of the amorphous magnetic alloy thin strips are shown in Table 5. In Table 5, the compositions indicated by are those of the present invention, and the compositions not indicated by are comparative examples. As is apparent from Table 8, the amounts of the A component Fe alone or a combination of Fe and M , the B component Si alone or a combination of Si and Al , and the C component B alone or a combination of B, C, and P are critical for obtaining improved resistance to pulse. Amorphous alloy thin strips 18 µn in thickness and 8 mm in width were produced by a known single roll method, wound in the form of a wound core, and heat treated. The properties of the cores and the composition of the amorphous alloy are shown in Table 6.
