# Raster CRT flicker reducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A raster scanned CRT device includes auxiliary vertical deflection means 11 operable during each scan line of the raster to deflect the electron beam 9 selectively between adjacent pairs of uniformly spaced image lines 14 on the screen 2 . Control logic 12 operates in response to video information representing an image to be displayed to write image pels 16 on the screen during two successive field scans of the raster 10 . The auxilliary deflection means 11 is controlled so that the entire image is formed on the image lines 14 , and the field scan in which te pels 16 are allocated for display is selcted on the fly for successive portions of the input video in such a way that pel imbalance between the two fields constituting the final image is minimised.
