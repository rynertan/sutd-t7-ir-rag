# Cubic boron nitride coated material and producing method of the same.

## Abstract
There are disclosed a cubic boron nitride coated mate rial including a substrate and an outer layer composed prin cipally of cubic boron nitride and formed on a surface of the substrate, comprising an intermediate layer formed of at least one intermediate layer and interposed between the substrate and outer layer, the intermediate layer or the outermost one of intermediate layers being formed of a lay er of at least one nitrogen containing compound selected from the nitrides and nitroxides of Al, Ga, In and Tl and mu tual solid solutions thereof, and a producing method of the same which comprises provideng, on the surface of the substrate, an interme diate layer formed of at least one intermediate layer, the in termediate layer or the outermost one of intermediate lay ers being formed of a layer of at least one nitrogen con taining compound selected from the group consisting of ni trides and nitroxides of Al, Ga, In and Tl and mutual solid solutions thereof and causing the outer layer to undergo oriented growth on a face of the layer of the at least one nitrogen containing com pound, the face being densely packed with nitrogen atoms.
