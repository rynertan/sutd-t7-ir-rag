# Weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A weighing system includes a weighing apparatus com posed of distributive table, a plurality of radial supply troughs disposed around the peripheral edge of the distributive table for being supplied with articles to be weighed from the distri butive table, a plurality of weighing units supporting respec tive openable weighing hoppers for weighing articles sup plied to the weighing hoppers, at least one of the distributive table and the radial supply troughs having a slide surface slanted radially outwardly to a large extent for allowing the articles to slide thereon, each of the radial supply troughs having a radially outer distral end disposed one of the weigh ing hoppers, and a collection chute disposed below the weighing hoppers. A liquid drain device is disposed at the distal end of each of the radial supply troughs. A shutter is interposed between each of the radial supply troughs and a corresponding one of the weighing hoppers. The radial sup ply troughs are supported on respective vibrators which are supported by detachable coil springs on a base plate. The weighing apparatus also includes a device for transmitting an output signal through space when the articles supplied to the distributive table reach a prescribed amount.
