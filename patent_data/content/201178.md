## Description
Plasma Heated Sintering SurfaceThis invention relates to a furnace and method for the sintering of refractory and ceramic materials using plasma heated gases.Prior art sintering furnaces, in general, tend to be inefficient and slow. Long furnace retention times are necessary when using conventional sintering furnaces, which results in poor energy utilisation, excessive furnace gas consumption and high maintenance costs.Many ceramic or refractory materials are sintered in prior art tunnel or periodic kilns which are fired by energy released from the combustion of fossil fuels with air or oxygen. If the ceramic or refractory material can be exposed to air and or the products of combustion, then the kiln may be directly fired, in which case, the heating and utilisation of energy may be reasonably efficient.However, for certain refractory materials, such as the carbides, nitrides and borides, the firing must be done in the absence of oxygen or oxygen bearing gases, including water and carbon dioxide, to prevent formation of oxides, which may result in products having undesirable physical and chemical properties. Under such conditions, fossil fuel fired furnaces may be used but the ceramic or refractory materials must be kept in a controlled environment, such as a retort, isolated from the combustion products of the fuel. Such heating is indirect, inefficient and slow. On a commercial scale, an apparatus such as a tunnel kiln requires about 70 90 hours including the cooling cycle to sinter refractory or ceramic articles. Prior art electric kilns are also used to sinter ceramic or refractory materials under controlled atmospheres, but again tend to be energy inefficient and slow. In the case of a kiln equipped with graphite heating elements, the voltage can be controlled and the kiln can be heated to fairly high temperatures, yet there are several disadvantages 1 The heating elements have a limited size, complex shape and must be kept under a strictly controlled atmosphere to maintain a long life and 2 Furnace size is limited and it is difficult to achieve a uniform temperature in this type of kiln because the heating elements provide only radiant heat. Because of radiant heat transfer, as well as a heat element size limit, the kiln has a poor load density, a limited productivity and a poor energy efficiency.A typical sintering cycle time using a prior art electric kiln is around 24 hours including cooling .Plasma arc technology has recently been applied to the production of refractory and ceramic materials to reduce the furnace energy requirements and retention times.Plasma sintering of refractory and ceramic materials results in higher density and superior strength products than those made by conventional processes.Plasma arc fired gases differ greatly from ordinary furnace heated gases in that they become ionised and contain electrically charged particles capable of transferring electricity and heat or, as in the case of nitrogen, become dissociated and highly reactive. For example, nitrogen plasma gas dissociates into a highly reactive mixture of N2 molecules, N atoms, N ions and electrons. This dissociation or ionisation greatly increases the reaction rates for sintering ceramic or refractory materials. Nitrogen, for example, which dissociates at around 50000C and 1 atmosphere pressure 1 bar , would not dissociate under the normal furnace sintering conditions of around 15000C 20000C. Thus, the use of plasma gases results in a highly reactive environment, which greatly increases the reaction sintering rate.Plasma arc technology has generally only been used for the fusion of high temperature materials and not for sinterin or reaction sintering. This is because the required sintering temperature for most ceramic or refractory materials is usually less than 25000C, whereas the average temperature of gases heated with a plasma arc torch is above 40000C. At such high temperatures, the refractory or ceramic materials may decompose. However, a plasma gas can be superheated to effect ionisation or dissociation, while the ceramic or refractory material is then directly heated by this preheated gas to a much lower temperature.For example, nitrogen plasma gas heated to around 30000C will bring silicon carbide refractory articles up to a temperature of 10000C 16000C in two to eight hours and nitrogen plasma gas heated to around 4000 C will bring the articles up to a temperature of 19000C 22000C in the same time period. Thus, a plasma gas may be heated to a much higher temperature than the sintering temperature required.This invention relates to an efficient furnace and method for the sintering of refractory or ceramic materials using plasma heated gases.The present furnace comprises a sintering chamber, at least one plasma torch inlet, an exhaust outlet, and means for controlling the furnace temperature during sintering so that the article being sintered does not decompose.Preferably, the furnace contains at least two plasma torch inlets, positioned asymmetrically through the walls of the sintering chamber. Asymmetric positioning of the plasma torch inlets can be achieved by locating the inlets on adjacent or opposite walls of the sintering chamber to create a uniform temperature distribution. If the furnace contains only one plasma torch inlet, the inlet should be positioned near the top of the sintering chamber to maximise convective turbulence created by the plasma heated gases. If there are two or more plasma torch inlets, at least one inlet should be positioned near the top of the sintering chamber, and at least one inlet should be positioned near the centre of the sintering chamber.Preferably, the exhaust outlet is located near the bottom of the sintering chamber in order to increase the plasma gas retention time, as well as increase the thermal convective turbulence.In a preferred embodiment, the furnace is cylindrically shaped, with a rectangular shaped inner sintering chamber.In another embodiment of the invention, the sintering chamber is cylindrically shaped. The furnace mass should be low to accommodate a high heating rate. The sintering chamber is surrounded by insulation, preferably formed from carbon or graphite as felt or material known under the Registered Trade Mark Fiberform . Thick insulation is not necessary when fast heating rates are utilised for sintering, since the cycle times are shortened. The exterior of the furnace comprises a structural material such as stainless steel. Preferably, there is a water cooled jacket layer between the insulative layers and the outer structural shell. The furnace may be opened from the bottom, sides or top. The present furnace is useful for sintering refractory or ceramic articles in a temperature controlled plasma environment. There are three means in the present furnace for controlling the furnace sintering temperature so that the ceramic or refractory material does not decompose.The first means comprises tangential injection of a secondary colder gas stream into the primary plasma gas stream as disclosed in US P ,559,312. The combined gas stream is fired into the sintering chamber through the plasma gas inlet s . Tangential injection of the secondary gas stream creates a swirl effect wherein the cold gas envelopes the hot plasma gas. The second means comprises the use of a plasma torch which can achieve highly stable and lower plasma gas temperatures. One such plasma torch is manufactured by Plasma Materials, Inc. PMI . A further means comprises directly introducing a secondary gas stream into the sintering chamber. Waste heat can be introduced as the secondary gas stream to improve the energy efficiency and to control the furnace temperature.Use of the present furnace for sintering ceramic or refractory materials results in a high furnace productivity, a higher energy efficiency, and uniform furnace temperatures.Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a plasma heated furnace which can be effectively controlled for the sintering of ceramic or refractory materials.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a furnace for sintering ceramic or refractory materials which achieves a high furnace productivity, a uniform temperature distribution in the sintering chamber, and a significant reduction of the retention time required for sintering.Another object of the present invention is to provide a sintering furnace for ceramic or refractory materials which must be sintered in a controlled gaseous environment.It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a furnace for the sintering of ceramic or refractory materials which is efficient and produces consistent, uniform and superior quality products.For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional top view of a preferred embodiment of the present furnace Figure 2 is a cross sectional side view of the furnace taken along the line A A of Figure 1 Figures 3 and 4 are diagrams showing the effect of tangential injection of a secondary gas into a primary hot plasma gas stream Figure 5 is a cross sectional side view of a plasma torch useful in connection with the present furnace and Figure 6 is a schematic process flowsheet showing the utilisation of the present furnace in a sintering process.This invention may be used to a great advantage in practising the process set forth in US P 4,559,312 entitled A SINTERING OR REACTION SINTERING PROCESS FORCERAMIC OR REFRACTORY MATERIALS USING PLASMA ARC GASES.The present furnace is also useful in practising the inventions as disclosed in USSN 718,375 co pending EPApplication No. entitled PLASMA ARC SINTERINGOF SILICON CARBIDE and as disclosed in USSN 718,374 entitled SYSTEM FOR PREVENTING DECOMPOSITION OF SILICONCARBIDE ARTICLES DURING SINTERING. USSN 718,375 discloses a process for the sintering of silicon carbide refractory or ceramic articles in a plasma heated furnace, wherein the silicon carbide article is heated by a plasma gas having an energy capacity of 2000 BTU lb 6000 BTU lb 4652 kJ kg 13956 kJ kg to a sintering temperature of between 15000C 25O00C, at a heating rate of 3000C hr 20000C hr, and held at the sintering temperature for 0.1 2 hours, yielding a total cycle time including cooling and loading of 1.5 to 20 hours and preferably around seven hours.This compares to a total cycle time of around 24 hours for an electric kiln. It should be noted that in such prior art electric kilns, such as furnaces known under the Trade Marks Centorr or Astro, the only mode of heat transfer is through radiation. USSN 718,374 discloses a process for the sintering of silicon carbide refractory or ceramic articles in a plasma heated furnace, wherein decomposition of the silicon carbide article is prevented by the use of covered crucibles, strategic placement of the plasma torches and exhaust outlet, and or the use of a sacrificial body of silicon carbide which decomposes before the silicon carbide article being sintered.At the outset, the invention is described in its broadest overall aspects with a more detailed description following. This invention relates to a furnace for sintering refractory or ceramic materials using plasma heated gases. The furnace of the invention comprises a sintering chamber, with strategic positioning of at least one plasma torch inlet and exhaust outlet, and means for controlling the furnace temperature during sintering so that the articles being sintered do not decompose.Preferably, the furnace contains at least two plasma torch inlets, positioned asymmetrically through the walls of the sintering chamber. Preferably, the exhaust outlet is located below the plasma torch inlets to increase the plasma gas retention time and thermal convective turbulence. The furnace of the invention for sintering refractory or ceramic articles includes three separate means for controlling the furnace sintering temperature 1 Tangential injection of a secondary colder gas stream into the primary plasma gas stream, with the combined gas stream being injected through the plasma gas inlet s into the sintering chamber 2 Use of a plasma torch which can achieve very stable and lower plasma gas temperatures and 3 Directly introducing a secondary gas stream into the sintering chamber. This third means may be used, separately, or in conjunction with one of the first two means for controlling the furnace temperature.Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings show cross sectional top and side views of a preferred furnace design of the present invention. The furnace 10 contains a sintering chamber 12, having two plasma torch inlets 14 and 14 , an exhaust outlet 16 and a furnace door bottom 18. The sintering chamber 12, shown in Figures 1 and 2, is rectangular box shaped, although it could also be cylindrically shaped. The sintering chamber 12 is lined with graphite plate 20. The exhaust outlet 16 is also lined with a material such as graphite 24. An insulative layer 26, such as of insulation material known under theTrade Mark Fiberform , surrounds the sintering chamber 12 in a rectangular shape. Insulative graphite felt layers 28 and 30 further surround the sintering chamber. Thick insulation is not required when high heating rates are utilised, such as disclosed in USSN 718,375 co pending EPApplication No. , since the total cycle time is less than 20 hours and preferably around seven hours. The furnace should have a light mass when high heating rates are utilised. A structural shell 32, such as stainless steel, forms the outer structure of the furnace. Between the outer structural shell 32 and the ring layer 30 is a water cooled jacket layer 34. The furnace top 36, bottom 38, 38 and door 18 are made from insulative materials such as graphite Fiberform . There is also water cooling of the top and bottom steel plates of the furnace not shown .Figure 2 of the drawings shows the positioning of the furnace door 18 on the bottom of the furnace so that the furnace charge may be loaded and unloaded easily in a sintering process such as that shown in Figure 6. The furnace door may also be positioned on the sides or top of the furnace, depending on process requirements. The exhaust outlet 16 is preferably positioned near the bottom of the sintering chamber 12 in order to increase the plasma gas retention time and to increase the thermal convective turbulence.Preferably, at least two plasma torches are utilised in connection with the furnace of the present invention to create a uniform temperature distribution. The torches should be positioned asymmetrically through injection ports in the walls of the sintering chamber to achieve a uniform temperature distribution. Asymmetric positioning of the plasma torch inlets may be achieved by locating the plasma torch inlets on opposite walls of the sintering chamber. For example, one inlet could be positioned in the upper right quadrant of the front face of the furnace sintering chamber 14 and another inlet could be positioned asymmetrically to the first inlet on the rear face 14 . Alternatively, the front face plasma gas inlet could be positioned near the top and middle and the rear face inlet could be positioned near the centre and middle.If the sintering chamber is cylindrically shaped, the plasma torch inlets should be positioned on opposite sides of the chamber 1800 apart , preferably with one torch inlet towards the top of the furnace, and the other towards the centre. There are an unlimited number of ways to position the plasma torch inlets to achieve asymmetric positioning. Asymmetric positioning is contrasted to symmetric positioning which involves plasma torch streams coming into direct opposition for instance, plasma torches located in the centre of both the front and rear faces of the furnace sintering chamber. Preferably, the plasma torch inlet is at a perpendicular angle to the sintering chamber, if the sintering chamber is rectangular shaped, although a slight angle may serve to avoid impingement of the plasma stream on the article being sintered.For a cylindrically shaped sintering chamber, the plasma torch inlet should be positioned radially with respect to the sintering chamber. If only one plasma torch is utilised, it should be positioned near the top of the furnace to maximise the convective turbulence created by the plasma heated gases. If more than two plasma torches are utilised, at least one torch should be positioned near the top of the sintering chamber, and at least one torch should be positioned near the centre of the sintering chamber.The furnace of the invention comprises three alternative means to control the temperature of the plasma heated gases, and to thus provide appropriate sintering temperatures for refractory and ceramic articles so that they do not decompose.The first means of controlling the furnace temperature is disclosed in US P 4,559,312. This means comprises tangential injection of a secondary colder gas stream into the hot primary plasma gas stream, as illustrated inFigure 3, with the resulting gas stream being fired directly into the sintering chamber through the furnace injection port s . Tangential injection of the secondary gas stream creates a swirl effect wherein the cold gas envelopes the hot plasma core, as illustrated in Figure 4.This tangential injection yields high energy efficiencies because the cold gas stream enveloping the hot plasma core stream prevents hydrodynamic interference of the secondary gas stream with the plasma arc gas stream. Another means of controlling the furnace temperature for the sintering of ceramic and refractory materials involves the use of a plasma torch which provides very stable sintering conditions at lower plasma gas temperatures.One such plasma torch which is useful in connection with the furnace of the invention is an NTLN 80 torch manufactured by Plasma Materials, Inc. PMI , 349 EastIndustrial Park Drive, Manchester, NH 03105. A crosssectional side view of the PMI torch is shown in Figure 5.The plasma torch 50 has two electrodes, a cathode 56 and an anode 54 which generate an electric arc to ionise or dissociate the plasma gas. A cathode holder 52, made from a conductive material such as copper, holds a pointed cathode tip 56 made of tungsten. The sharpness of the cathode tip 56 at a given primary gas flow rate determines the operating voltage across the electrodes. The anode 54 is also made of copper. Nitrogen, argon or other gases 58 are introduced through thirty openings 60 and 60 only two are pictured in Figure 5 in a collar which surrounds the space 62 between the cathode tip 56 and anode 54 where the gas is ionised or dissociated. The plasma gas stream 64 exits the plasma torch 50 at one end 64. The arrow shows the direction of travel. Water 66 and 66 is circulated through the torch 50 for cooling.A further means of lowering and or controlling the sintering furnace temperature is to directly introduce a colder secondary gas stream into the sintering chamber.Waste heat from the sintering process may be recirculated back into the furnace as such a secondary gas stream. Two types of secondary gas stream additions are illustrated, generally, in Figure 6. This means may be utilised solely to control the furnace temperature so that decomposition of the article being sintered does not decompose, or it may be used in conjunction with the two aforementioned alternate means of 1 tangential injection of a secondary gas stream into the hot primary gas stream, or 2 use of a temperature controlled plasma torch such as the PMI torch. Figure 6 is a flowsheet showing the utilisation of the furnace of the present invention in a sintering process.A load of formed refractory or ceramic articles 70 is placed onto a car 72 which moves along a track system 74.The load 70 is moved along the track 74 to directly under a furnace 76. There, a lift system 78 lifts the charge 70 up into the furnace 76. The furnace 76 is closed and evacuated by a vacuum pump 80. Evacuation of the furnace is especially important for refractory or ceramic materials such as the carbides, nitrides and borides, which should be sintered in an oxygen free environment.Suitable plasma gases for these materials include argon, nitrogen, neon, helium and hydrogen, or a combination of these gases.After evacuation, a plasma torch 82 fires a plasma gas, such as nitrogen 84, into the furnace 76 for a sufficient time to sinter the refractory or ceramic articles. A secondary cooler gas stream 86 is useful for lowering and controlling the furnace sintering temperature. Exhaust from the furnace leaves the furnace through an exhaust outlet 88 and is cooled in a primary gas cooler 90 and a secondary gas cooler 92. The cooled gas is then filtered 94, and sent to the building exhaust system 96 by a blower 98. The filtered exhaust stream may also be recirculated 100 back as waste heat to the furnace 76 for controlling the furnace temperature.After sintering and cooling, the sintered load 70 is unloaded by the lift system 78 and moved down the track system 74. A typical cycle time for sintering refractory or ceramic articles using the furnace and method of the present invention is around eight hours, including loading, sintering, cooling and unloading. The invention is further illustrated by the following example. EXAMPLE 1A cylindrically shaped furnace having dimensions of about 30 inches 76.2 cm in height and an outer diameter of around 35 inches 88.9 cm was constructed in accordance with the invention. The sintering chamber was approximately 13 inches 33.02 cm by 14 inches 35.5 cm wide and 15 inches 38.1 cm high and lined with approximately 0.5 inch 1.27 cm of graphite. Ten layers two inches 5.08 cm of graphite felt surrounded the sintering chamber. Pieces of carbon felt of 19 inches 2 square 122.58 cm to 26 7 8 inches 67.95 cm diameter further surrounded the walls of the sintering chamber to yield a 26 7 8 inches 67.95 cm diameter shape.Sixteen layers of carbon felt further surrounded the chamber to form an outer diameter of 34R inches 88.27 cm .Stainless steel was used for the outer shell a space was left between the insulation and shell for water cooling. The furnace top, bottom and door were made from graphite Fiberform . The furnace top was 33 inches 9.53 cm high, the furnace bottom was 8 1 6 inches 20.8 cm high at its maximum, and the furnace door was 9 inches 24.77 cm high at its maximum. The furnace had two plasma torch inlets and an exhaust outlet, all lined with graphite.One of the plasma torch inlets was positioned on a side wall near the top of the sintering chamber and the other plasma torch inlet was asymmetrically positioned on the opposite wall of the sintering chamber.Accordingly, a furnace has been developed for the plasma sintering of ceramic or refractory materials which is energy efficient, results in high furnace productivities and superior sintered products.
