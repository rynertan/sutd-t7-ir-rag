# Process and catalyst for the oligomerization of olefins.

## Abstract
Olefins are oligomerized to a desired oligomer by utilizing a catalyst which comrpises a porous support containing a catalytically effective amount of an iron group metal hydrate in which the mole ratio of water of hydration to iron group metal is greater than 0.5 1 in combination with a catalytically effective amount of an alkyl aluminum com pound and and aluminum halide.
