# EXTRUSION MACHINERY

## Abstract
Conform machinery for continuous friction effected extrusion having a wheel 1 comprising two cheek members 2, a central hub 4 which forms the base of the working passage way 5 and two separate ring members 3 which form the side walls of the working passageway and provide slip surfaces 11, 12 between the cheek members and the rings. The abutting slip surfaces of the check members and rings are shaped to allow thermal expansion of the rings relative to the cheek members with the slip surfaces in driving engagement but to limit radial movement in a radial direction at any particular place on the circumference to a distance less than the relative expansion in the diameter of the ring between ambient temp eratures and the expected working conditions of the machine.
