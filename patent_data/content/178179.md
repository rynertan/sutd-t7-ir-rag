# HANDLING AND STORING CABLE SPLICED ENDS OF OPTICAL FIBERS

## Abstract
For storing the spliced end sections of optical fibers, a tray 1 is used having a first and second series of channels 9, 11 each for receiving an optical fiber 20 , the first series being spaced from the second series by a gap, and a splice block 31 is releasably mounted in the gap, the splice block also having a series of channels 33 that substantially span the gap where by the respective channels of the first series are connected to the corresponding channels of the second series by the chan nels in the splice block. A tray 1 is used for each group of fibers one group from each cable 27, 29 , spliced together respectively to connect the cables together. The optical fibers 20 from a first cable 27 are spliced to the corresponding op tical fibers 20 in a second cable 29 , the splices being mount ed on the splice block 31 . The tray constitutes a means 39, 41, 47 ,49, 51, 53 for storing the buffer tubing 23, 25 that is wound up on the tray 1 . A receptacle 59 is provided with a plurality of tray mounting cavities 69 for storage and in dividual retrieval of each of the trays 1 .
