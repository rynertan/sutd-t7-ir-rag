## Description
The present invention concerns a proccss for the production of aggregates with simultaneous recovery of industrial or civil wastes consisting of waste waters, dusts and or muds. The invention also concerns the aggregates, foamed and not foamed as obtained by using said process.Processes for the production of aggregates are already known, said processes starting from a base material, at least a binder and additives with which fresh granules are formed and subsequently sent to a thermal treatment.It is known that clay, shale, other natural materials as well as industrial wastes such as ashes coming from coal combustion, wastes coming from ore concentration and flocculation, etc. are used as base material. Still according to said known processes see for instance theItalian patent application no.49115 A 80 , the fresh granules are prepared starting from a base material which is sprayed with a binder, in case constituted by clay, saturated with water, and then sent to a slanting rotary granulation plate or to extruders. Afterwards the fresh granules are submitted to sintering in a rotary furnace.As starting material the use of not better specified industrial wastes was foreseen, under the form of impalpable ash, dust or wastes from ore concentration and flocculation. It has however been noticed that said process is not suitable for making waste waters dusts and or muds inert and harmless, specially if they have high metal content, for which it is absolutely necessary that a safe and complete resistance to washout is obtained in order to ensure in any case that the aggregates obtained are not themselves a source of pollution.Other processes of aggregating inorganic industrial muds, even with high metal content, are known and they essentially consist in mixing the base material with appropriate dehydrating materials, hydraulic and or aggregate binders, and in granulating them. The materials obtained, according to their composition, can be sent to dump or, in particular cascs, they can also be used in the cement industry.In case the production of light aggregates and in particular foamed clay is foreseen, thn techniques comprise the preparation of granules starting from clay, water and additives. Among the latter, combustible oils are specially used, as in the subsequent thermal treatment they will be eliminated by combustion, thus forming pores in the granules. At the same time water and other volatile substances disappear under the gaseous state, so that an expansion and an increase in volume are obtained.The final result is constituted by granules which are internally porous and externally clinkerized, with apparent density in heap ranging 3 between 0.2 and 1 Kg dm , with sizes ranging between 0.1 and 30 mm and having mechanic resistance to compression, determined according to UNI 7549, exceeding 2 3 Kg cm , said granules being suitable for different uses.Also in the production of light aggregates, the use of substances coming from industrial wastes was proposed see for instance the above said Italian patent application .However, the known systems, have various drawbacks among which mainly the fact that the fresh granules have an insufficient mechanic resistance to be treated in a rotary furnace, and also the fact that often no expansion occurs during the thernlar treatment, so that it is therefore not possible to obtain the production of foamed aggregates having equal properties as those of the commercially available foamed clays. In general, however, the technologies known up to now for the formation of aggregates with waste waters, muds and or dust coming from industrial and or civil wastes by using clay or similar products are based on the concept of inserting the waste material into a kind of outer skin consisting of sinterized clay and made impermeable or substantially impermeable by means of appropriate processes.Said known techniques however do not assert that wastes, specially containing metals, are made completely harmless under conditions of prolonged washout, but above all they cannot be used with aggregates which may be employed in any possible use and therefore even in uses in which they are submitted to frequent washout, eventually even in crushed or ground condition, nor with foamed aggregates which present a certain fragility to compression stresses and which therefore can break, freeing the substances to be made harmless and therefore cpmpletely Aestroçirxg the advantageous ecological effects of the above mentioned technologies.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of aggregates with the recovery of waste waters, dusts and or muds coming from purification of industrial and or civil wastes, eventually also containing metals, in order to a final product absolutely inert as far as pollution is concerned, even if submitted to prolonged washout and also in crushed or ground condition, in particular an aggregate which gives positive results when submitted to know washout tests carried out on ag gregates under granular ïorl, obtained by the treatment as well as on aggregates which underwent a subsequent operation of breaking or even of grinding.Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of foamed aggregates, also allowing to perform the recovery of waste waters1 dusts and or muds from purification of industrial and or civil wastes, and obtaining a final product absolutely equal to traditional foamed clays.Still another object of the invention is to provide a process of the abovesaid type and with the abovesaid characteristics which also allows to obtain considerable savings in respect to the technologies known up to now used to produce foamed clays, said savings being obtainable also thanks to the elimination or reduction of said combustible oils and or other expanding additives, on one side, and due to an energy saving during the thermal treatment, on the other side.when the material to be ecovered contains organic substances.To sumari,e, tric invention proposes a new process for the industrial production of foamed or not foamed agbregates, obtained in an conorrically advantageous way using, at least partly, recovery material, eventually containing metals, with the warranty that said material, if polluting in itself, is comple tely made inert and harmless indep ndently from its use and the treatment to which the aggregates obtained are submitted.To achieve said objects, the invention concernes a process for the industrial production of aggregates starting from waste waters, dusts arid or muds of industrial and or cix 1 purification, characterized by the steps of mixing from 30 to 99 by volume of clay and from 70 to 1 by volume of said waste waters, dusts and or muds adding if necessary water so as to reach at least 10 humidity of the mixture treating the mixture mechanically or by other physical processes to obtain a high homogenization of the mixture granulating and thermally treating the mixture at temperatures ranging between 7000C and 13000 C. In an absolutely new and surprising way, the product obtained is completely inert to all washout tests, not only under the conditions as it comes out of the treatment according to the invention, but also if it is submitted to subsequent operations, such as grinding operations, which destroy the external protective layer of the granule. Therefore, even in ground condition, the product resists to washout tests, thus being completely inert and harmless at least up to the level of crystal lattice, notwithstanding the polluting materials contained in the starting formulation.As mn 2 oned above, said dusts X muds S1 contain organic sub stances, in particlllar substances with high molecular weight and low volatility, preferably with a molecule weight cveceding 80 and irore preferably e cceeb 00. It is the case for e,xa...ple 6 residues of resins, rubbers, starch, cellulose, dys, proteins, hydrocarbons, etc.Of ourse, type of mud can be used, in general inorganic muds and or muds with partial organic contents deriving from processes of purification of industrial waters or waste waters. These can range from suspensions having up to 99 in water to solids for example filter pressed panels containing 30 50 in water . Muds deriving from process water thickening sedimentation for example refinery muds can be used, containing even considerable amounts of organic substances up to 60 on the dry product . Other possibilities are given by the utilization of flying ashes and heavy ashes deriving from coal combustion, for instance from thermoeletric power plants. These recovery materials can also contain metals, generally under the form of oxides,the content of which ranges from few p.p.m. to various for instance from 0.01 to 80 by weight on the dry product .Besides calcium, silicium and alluminium the first is usually added to purification plants under the form of lime to precipitate metal hydroxides, the second ones are constituents of earth, sand and flocculating agents variable quantities of all metals can be present, in particular iron, nickel, chromium, zinc, cadmium, cobalt and others, in amounts obviously varying according to the process from which they come. Th. process to obtain aggregates according to the invention comprises, as already said, a thorough mixing of the clay with waste waters, dusts and or muds, even tual3y with the addition of water and additives which can consist of lime, calcium carbonate, volatile ashes and heavy ashes, hydraulic binders, molding sands, smoke winning powders, sand.These additives, in amount to 30 by volume, are added because they can serve as fluxes if nuds nn not sufficient and or they can lower the water content in the initial mixture and nally irWrove t.e wor kaj1iii Ly. Cold mixing is performed and then the mixture is submitted to a mechanical or physical process such as to obtain a maximum of homongeneity in the treated mass.This processing can comprise a kneading operation, a rolling step and extrusion or granulation of the mixture, or other types of processing, for instance squashing in apparatuses of pan mill type, or also homogeneization with suspension in water, in order to achieve the above mentioned object of the maximum possible homogeneity of the treated mass. At the end, granules of the desired sized are obtained adapted to be submitted to drying. This operation can be performed in the same furnace as that of the subsequent cooking of the material as well as in appropriate driers for instance of a rotary type, which work at temperatures ranging between 50 and 250 C.After that the material is submitted to cooking in furnace, preferably in rotary furnace with countercurrent or ecuicurrent flows and with temperatures from 700 C to 1300 C.The above defined process allows to obtain both foamy or nol. foamed aggregates. In the first case a percentage of clay from 80 to 99 will be used with thermal treatment between 100000 and 1300 C and a composition of the waste waters, dusts and or muds wi l such as to introduce a sufficient quantity of organic materials to obtain expansion without the need of adding cornbustible oils and therefore with considerable economic advantage. It has been calculated that it is sufficient to use muds having at least 1 of organic substances, with molecular weight exceeding BO, preferably exceeding 300.The obtained foamed aggregate, with specific weight less than 0.8 kg dm , has the same physical properties as the commercially available foamed clay and, even if the starting waters, muds or dusts contain metals, it results completely harmless to washout tests.Should the clay percentage be reduced to 30 80 , preferably to 40 70 w, with waste waters, dusts and or muds from 70 to 2zSó, better from 60 to 30 , and containing metal oxides and or metals from 0.01 to 80 by weight on the dry product, and should the thermal treatment be performed between 700 C and 1100 C, a generally not foamed aggregate is obtained.The mechanical properties of the aggregates thus obtained obviously depend on the starting material used and on the percentage of same in respect to the clay. In particular, it will be possible to obtain aggregates having ever decreasin density by adding to tne mixture organic substances serving as expan ers, for example sub.sfanefs which can also be obtained frm,industri l aru o civic wistes. The products are characterized by the fact of containing more than 0.1 by weight and preferably more than 5 by weight in metals on the dry product, besides the clay metal contribution, and have apparent density ranging 3 between 0.5 and 2 kg dm . Moreover they present almost inexistent washout harmfullness when checked by means of the presently known lixiviation tests.The invention will be now illustrated by the following examples, given by indicative and not limiting purpose.EXAMPLE 1An industrial tes.t was performed using muds coming from purification processes of industria wastes, in particular muds from chemical plants having 57.1 H20 and 33.5 of organic subsbances. The mud, after a thickening operation in appropriate filter press, had a humidity ranging between 45 and 75 and showed a high content of organic substances.The mud was mixed with clay so as to have a homogeneous mass having the following composition clay 99 mud 1 water up to reach a mixture with 30 humidity.Muds and clays were taken from measuring boxes capable ef giving the desired percentages. A part of the clay was mixed with the muds in a pre filter where stones and slags were eliminated, and then the addition of base clay was performed thus completing the mixture.The latter was then treated in a sod breaker unit, in a mixing and homogenizing pan mill machine and in a mixer in which water was added to reach the desired humidity degree.When out, the mixture was placed in a misuring box from which suitable amounts were drawn for subsequent treatment in a train of rolls, in another mixJ de vice and finally in a kneading machine with extrusion head die operating with degassing step. At the end of the extrusion, which was performed t the higher pressure the greatest was the mud cor,t nt, the completely homogenized mixture was sent to thermal treatment to be dried and then cooked at approximately 1150 C. Said thermal treatment was carried out in a rotary furnace thus obtaining a foamed aggregate having apparent density of 0.31 kg dm and physical properties, in particular a pressure resistance, identical to the ones of foamed clay in the trade.EXAMPLE 2The same kind of mud of example 1 was used by mixing it with clay in different ratios, but following the same procedure. The starting mixtures had the following compositions clay 96.60S 93.72 1,00 mud 3.40 6.28 9.00 water up to reach approximately 30 humidity.The foamed aggregates obtained had an ar,oarent density of 0.31 kg dm and 0.35 kg dm and 0.32 kg dm respectively. Thr, presence of small size grit, due to granules crurbling, re sulted to be within the limits of normal production, as in the previous example.EXAMPLE 3 The mud of the preceding examples was used additioned with inorganic mud coming from a mechanical plant and having 22.1 of H20.The mud was mixed with clay as in Example 1 so as tc have a homogeneous mixture having the following composition 80 clay mud from chemical plant 2 mud from mechanical plant 18 eventually water up to reach 30 humidity.The product after drawing and drying was thermally treated in a rotary furnace obtaining a foamed clay with apparent density of 0.33 kg dm EXAMPLE 4A tannery mud was used having 77.5 , of H20 and 10.3 of organic substances.The raw granules had the following composition clay 95.3 mud 4.7 The product submitted to the usual process, gave a foamed aggregate with apparent density corresponding 3 to 0.31 kg dm , good characteristics both of thermal isolation and of granule resistance.In this case, too, as in all the previous ones, foamed aggregates were obtained having behaviour and cha racteristics equal to those of normally produced foamed clay, said aggregates being obtained with energy savings due to the elimination of combustible oil, and being able to overcome elution tests.EXAMPLE 5An industrial test was carried out using muds coming from industrial operations and containing mineral oils.The mud was mixed with clay so as to have a homogeneous mass with the following composition clay 70 by volume mud a by volume eventually water up to reach a mixture aaVing 33D humidity. is and claj s were treated as in example 1 except for the fact that the thennal tre8 Jrnt drying and then cooking was performed up to a temperature of 8c O0C. The product obtained resulted to be an aggregate perfectly resistant to usual washout tests, having good mechanic resistance and apparent density of approxifliately 0.75 kg dm3. EXAMPLE 6 Thie same kind of niud as in example 5 was used mixing it with clay and following the same procedure as that of example 5, but with the following ratics lay 30 by volume mud 736 by volume eventually water up to reach a mixture having approximately 30 humidity.The aggregate obtained presented the same characteristics of resistance to washout as the one of exampl 3 5, an apparent density of approximately 1.25 kg dm and higher mechanic resistance.EXAMPLE 7A dust with a high content in heavy metals coming from electrofilters was used.The dust was treated as in example 5, mixing it with clay in the following ratios powder from smokes 30 by volume clay 70 by volume eventually water up to reach 30 humidity in the mixture.The obtained aggregate had apparent specific weight of approximately 0.75 kg dm with perfect resistance to washout and good characteristics of mechanic resistance. EXAMPLE 8Following the same procedure and using the same dust as in example 7, aggregates were obtained having apparent 3 specific weight of approximately 1.25 kg dm and re sistant to washout, starting from an initial mixture having the following composition dust 70 by volume clay 30 by volume eventually water up to reach approximately 30 humidity for kneading and extruding. EXAMPLE 9Aggregates were obtained starting from the following materials inorganic mud coming from chemical plant 40 mud with high content in organic substances coming from textile plant 10 clay 50 eventually water up to obtain sufficient humidity for kneading and extruding.In this case the result was an aggregate which was obtained with energy savings due to the presence of organic substances and which, as in any case all the aggregates of the present invention, overcome the elution tests, in particular the tests according to a Law region of Lombardia Italy No.94 80 enclosure 3 b Environ,ental Protection Agency EPA Report 1980 both under granular form and after crushing and or grinding of granules, substantially giving the same results.
