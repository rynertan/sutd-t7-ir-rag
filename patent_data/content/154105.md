# A process for decreasing the nitrate content in water.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process for decreasing the content of nitrate in ground water, artificial ground water, that is infiltrated surface water, or surface water flowing through an aquifer or through a basin or a filter containing naturally occurring filter material. Water containing denitrifi cation organisms and or substrate therefore is introduced intermittently through a number of injection wells or injec tion pipes arranged around one or more extraction wells or extraction pipes for purified water. During each introduction of water containing denitrification organisms and or subs trate therefore said water is fed to only some of said injection wells or pipes and simultaneously water is drawn from nearby, adjacent or intervening injection wells or pipes or the purpose of creating a denitrification zone at a distance sufficiently far from the extraction well or extraction pipe.
