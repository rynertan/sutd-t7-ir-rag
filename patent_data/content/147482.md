# Low temperature tunneling transistor.

## Abstract
The transistor comprises two electrodes, source 12 and drain 13 , with a semiconductor tunnel channel 11 arranged therebetween. A gate 14 for applying control signals is coupled to the channel. The semiconductor, at low temperatures, behaves like an insulator with a low barrier some meV through which charge carriers can tunnel under the influence of an applied drain voltage. The tunnel current can be controlled by a gate voltage V
