# Mass transfer apparatus and its use.

## Abstract
A process for increasing mass transfer coefficients for mass transfer between two fluid phases, one of which is a liquid, is disclosed. The process comprises charging the fluids to an element 9 which has a large interfacial area and which is permeable to the fluids and rotating the element 9 such that the fluids are subjected to an acceleration of at least 300 m sec
