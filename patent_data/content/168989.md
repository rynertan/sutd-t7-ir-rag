## Description
Ruthenium Promoted Cobalt Catalyst for the Dealkoxyhydroxymethylation of Formaldehyde Acetals to Form Glycol EthersThis invention relates to the dealkoxyhydroxymethylation of acetals.More particularly, it relates to a novel process for the dealkoxyhydroxymethylation of certain dialkyl , dicycloalkyl , or diarylformaldehyde acetals by reacting said acetals with syngas, i.e., hydrogen and carbon monoxide, in the presence of novel ruthenium carbonyl promoted cobalt carbonyl catalysts to form the corresponding ethylene glycol monoethers. Still more particularly, it relates to the catalysts per se and methods for preparing the same. The methylal described herein may be added directly or formed in situ from the corresponding formaldehyde and alcohol precurors.The glycol ethers described herein encompass known classes of compounds Åaaving various uses, as for example as jet fuel additives, cleaners, coatings solvents, intermediates in the production of certain diphthalates, and the like.One current well known method of manufacturing ethylene glycol m9noethers such as monoalkyl ethers consists of reacting ethylene oxide with the alcohol corresponding to the desired alkyl ether, employing various known catalyst systems. Alternatively, the cobalt catalyzed reaction of aldehydes or their dialkyl acetals with syngas, i.e., a carbon monoxide hydrogen mixture, to form the corresponding glycol ether is also described in the art. Thus, for example, a method of making ethylene glycol ethers is described inU.S. Patent No. 2,525,793 which employs cobalt oxide to catalyze the reaction of methylal with syngas to provide a reaction mixture which, after hydrogenation.over nickel, gives relatively uneconomical conversions on the order of 25 33 .Numerous attempts have been made to obtain more practical yields of glycol ethers from aldehydes or their dialkylacetals. A number of promoters have been used in conjunction with various cobalt catalysts in an effort to improve reaction rates and product yields. U.S.Patent 4,062,898, for example, discloses a ruthenium chloride promoted cobalt iodide catalyst which hydrocarbonylates formaldehyde dimethylacetal methylal to ethylene glycol monomethyl ether EGMME in yields of 10 or less. The reaction temperature required is 1850C at 20 atm. or above. A second method, described in Jpn. Xokai Tokkyo Koho 81 83,432 1981 uses substantial quantities of 2,4,6 collidine or similar aromatic amines to promote the cobalt carbonyl catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of methylal in benzene as a solvent. The reaction of methylal with highly pressurized syngas in this process at 1900C for 10 hours gave 44 selectivity to EG at at 98 conversion. A further patent,Euro. Pat. Appln.EP 34,374 1981 uses both iodine and triphenyl or tricyclohexylphosphine together with RuC13 H20 to promote the Co Ac 24H2O catalyzed hydrocarbonyiation of methylal using 3000 psig of syngas, and temperatures of between 150 and 1750C to obtain results nearly comparable to those of the Japanese.More recently, Knifton has found that cobalt carbonyl promoted with aGroup VIB donor ligand catalyzes the hydrocarbonylation of an aldehyde in an alcohol to make ethylene glycol monoethers U.S. 4,308,403. Yields of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether EGMBE as high as 61 were reported in this patent. A cyclopentadienyl ligated cobalt catalyst is also effective for these reactions giving glycol ethers in up to 54 yield U.S. 4,317,943.Propylene glycol monoalkyl ethers are formed by contacting high pressure mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen with either an acetal or an aldehyde and an alcohol using a cobalt catalyst promoted with a tin or germanium containing compound U.S. 4,356,327. Yields of glycol ethers up to 31 were reported in this patent. Ethylene glycol ethers were also formed from a formaldehyde acetal or formaldehyde and an alcohol using tin or germanium promoters for cobalt carbonyl U.S. 4,357,477. The highest glycol ether yield EGMBE was 53 in this case.Finally, propylene glycol monoalkyl ethers were formed by hydrocarbonylation of acetaldehyde acetals or acetaldehyde and alcohols using rhodium, ruthenium or nickel compounds to promote either cobalt carbonyls or cobalt compounds having group V ligand systems attached.Glycol ether yields up to 28 were realized when these promoters were used Knifton, U.S. 4,390,734 1983 . Thus, the use of various promoters for the cobalt catalyzed hydrocarbonylation of aldehydes or acetals has resulted in glycol ether yields of from 10 61 , depending on the glycol ether produced. The highest reported yield of EGMME is 44 , of EGMBE is 61 and PGMEE is 28 . In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an improved process for the reaction of certain dialkyl , dicycloalkyl , or diaryl formaldehyde acetals or their formaldehyde alcohol precursors with syngas in the presence of novel ruthenium carbonyl promoted cobalt carbonyl catalysts, to form the corresponding ethylene glycol monoethers.This reaction, which may best be described as the dealkoxyhydroxymethylation of an acetal formed separately or in situ by the known reaction of formaldehyde with an alcohol, may be depicted by the following general reaction scheme.EMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2, which may be the same or different, and which together may be joined by one or more bridging atoms as described below to form a cyclic compound, comprise any organic moieties which are inert to the conditions of the reaction, and are selected from the group consisting of a a straight or branched chain alkyl group having from I to about 20 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, t butyl, 2 ethylhexyl, dodecyl, and the like b a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl group having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, 3 methylcyclopentyl, 3 butylcyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, adamantyl, decalyl, 3 phenylcycloheptyl and the like and c a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group having from I to about 20 carbon atoms such as henzyl, phenyl, naphthyl, fluoroanthryl, tetralyl, tolyl ethylphenyl, cumyl, anisyl, chlorophenyl, and tbe like. It will be understood that when RI and R2 in the foregoing reaction scheme are different, the resulting products will actually be mixtures of the corresponding ethers and alcohols.This invention is also described to the novel ruthenium promoted cobalt carbonyl catalysts per se, and to methods for preparing the same. In a further embodiment it has been found that additionally there may be employed as the catalyst a composition comprising a ruthenium carbonylpromoted cobalt carbonyl metal cluster of the formula Co2 Ru CO ll, which may be prepared by the method disclosed by Roland et al,Angew. Chem. Int. Engl., 20, 679 1981 , and which is useful for preparing glycol ethers derived from other acetals as well, such as diethoxymethane, dileutoxymethane, diethoxyethane and the like. This process, using the novel catalysts of this invention, provides an improvement over the methods of the prior art in that the instant catalysts do not require the added presence of the iodide, amines, or phosphine promoters such as are disclosed in the prior art, and thus are less costly and easier to prepare and recover. Moreover, these novel catalysts permit the reaction to be carried out under more mild conditions of time and temperature than those of the prior art, yet most surprisingly provide rates and selectivities of desired product over those obtained by the use of cobalt carbonyl alone.The novel homogenous catalysts of this invention which may be prepared in varying ways, are ruthenium carbonyl promoted dicobalt octacarbonyls, more specifically, triruthenium dodecacarbonyl dicobalt octacarbonyl mixtures. This catalyst system is readily prepared by simply mixing dicobalt octacarbonyl Co2 CO 8 with ruthenium dodecacarbonyl Ru3 CO 12 in the reaction medium. The molar ratios of these two components are optimally in the range of about 10 1 to 1 10, and preferably about 5 1 to 1 5.It has also been found, in accordance with this invention, that when the catalyst mixture is allowed to precipitate from the reaction medium following completion of the hydroxymethylation reaction this material unexpectedly has been found to have superior catalytic activity over the initial ruthenium cobalt carbonyl mixture in terms of rates and selectivities. This activity has been found to vary somewhat, however, depending upon the rate at which the precipitate forms, along with other factors such as the initial concentrations, ratios, and the like.Thus, for example, when the ruthenium and cobalt carbonyl catalysts are mixed into the reaction medium in molar ratios of 1 1, and the mixture allowed to precipitate out of solution, following dealkoxyhydroxymethylation, for a period of 1 25 days, the resulting solid, when introduced into a methylal syngas reaction, has equal or increased activity with respect to rates and selectivities for ethylene glycol monoether.Equally surprising, it has also been found that an even more active catalyst than the precipitate described above may be obtained by heating the ruthenium and cobalt mixture for periods of from about 1 to 5 hours in the presence of an inert organic solvent, preferably a chlorinated aromatic such as chlorobenzene, o dichlorobeazene, or the like, under pressurized syngas. The mixture, on cooling, results in an orange colored precipitate, which when used as a catalyst in the dealkoxylhydroxymethylation of methylal, results in significant improvements in the rates and selectivities for the ethylene glycol ether over the original catalyst mixture.For example, when ruthenium and cobalt carbonyl are mixed in molar ratios of 1 1, heated in chlorobenzene at about 1500 C. under ev 3000 psi of syngas for about 3 hours, and then cooled, the resulting precipitate has increased catalytic activity in a methylal dealkoxyhydroxymethylation reaction. The formaldehyde acetal dealkoxyhydroxymethylation reaction with syngas, as described above, utilizing the novel ruthenium cobalt carhonyl catalyst mixtures of this invention, including the aforedescribed precipitated forms thereof, may conveniently be conducted in a generally known manner whereby the desired acetal is reacted with syngas under elevated temperature and pressures for given periods of time, during which period the reaction mixture is efficiently stirred.In this reaction, the volume ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen in the syngas desirably is in the range of from about 1 3 to 3 1, and more preferably 1 2 to 2 1. Following rapid cooling, the reaction product is then recovered from the mixture in a routine manner. In contrast to the prior art reaction conditions described above, the novel ruthenium cobalt carbonyl catalysts of this invention advantageously permit the use of more mild operating conditions. Thus, temperatures in the range of from about 100 to 2000C, and preferably about 125 to 1750C, pressures of from about 500 to 5000 psi, and preferably about 1000 to 3000 psi, may satisfactorily be employed.The ratio of the weight of catalyst mixture employed, to the weight of acetal, is desirably in the range of from about .001 0.1, and preferably .005 .05 in a batch reaction. In a further embodiment of this invention, it has been found that highly advantageous effects may also be obtained in this dealkoxyhydroxymethylation process by the addition of solvents in combination with the catalyst system of this invention.The solvents which may be advantageously used comprise any polar or non polar organic solvents which are inert to the conditions of the reaction. Included amongst these solvents are C1 12 alcohols, preferably those corresponding to the alkyl group of the formaldehyde acetal, such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, 3 ethyl 2 hexanol and the like ethers which will not cleave under the conditions of the reaction, such as glyme, diglyme, diphenyl ether and the like aromatics and substituted aromatics such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, anisole, and the like.The solvents may constitute anywhere from 0 to 90 volume percent of the reaction mixture, and preferably 20 to 80 percent. The acetal starting materials employed in this invention have the aforedescribed general formula, namelyEMI10.1 wherein the RÚ and Rê groups are as defined above. These acetals can be prepared in a known manner, separately or in situ, as for example as described in E.V. Dehmlav and J. Schmidt, Tetrahedron Letters, p.95 6 1976 B.S. Bal and H.W. Pinnick, J. Org. Chem. V44 21 , p. 3727 8 1979 D.W. Hall, U.S. Patent 3,492,356, Jan. 27 19 0 , by the reaction of formaldehyde with an alcohol, or mixture of alcohols, of the general formula RÚOH or RêOH, where again RÚ and Rê are as defined above, form the corresponding acetal. Hereinafter, when the scetal is referred to, it will be understood that the corresponding precursors, formaldehyde and the desired alcohol, are also intended to be included. As also mentioned above, the organic substituents of the resulting acetal may be joined by one or more bridging atoms to form such cyclic compounds asEMI11.1 and the like, wherein X is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aralkyl, aryl and cycloalkyl groups having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms.It is essential, in selecting the acetal starting material, that it not contain any substituents which are reactive under the conditions of the dealkoxyhydroxymethylation process of this invention. In other words, the R1 and R2 groups should not, for example, contain or comprise such reactive moieties as phosphine, arsine, amino, sulfido or carbonyl groups, acetal moieties, or olefins or acetylenic double bonds. Other like groups will be recognized or readily determined by those skilled in the art as resulting in produdts other than the desired monoethers.When these acetals are dealkoxyhydroxymethylated with syngas in accordance with the process of this invention, there is obtained the corresponding ethylene glycol monoether in which the ether moiety will correspond to the organic moieties of the acetal starting material. Also formed in lesser amounts is the trialkoxyethane of the gene ral formula EMI12.1 together with the alcohol R2OH, which may be recycled to form additional acetal starting material. Again, ss above, if the R groups of the acetal are different, a mixture of corresponding R substituted compounds will result.As shown below, the selectivities for the desired monoether over the trialkoxy by product are in the ratio of from about 3 1 to as much as 10 1 or more.In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the starting materials are preferably symmetrical acetals where the R groups are lower alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms1 thereby forming the corresponding ethylene glycol mono lower alkyl ethers such as the monomethyl ether, the monoethyl ether, and the like.Alternatively, the acetal may contain such RÚ and Rê groups as nathyl and phenyl. In the case of naphthyl, the reaction of the resulting formaldehyde acetal with syngas will provide 2 2 naphthyloxy ethanol, a known sedative, which in turn may be oxidized to the corresponding 2 naphthyloxyacetic acid, a plant growth hormone. Likewise, the dealkoxyhydroxymethylation of the acetal, wherein R1 and 2 R are phenyl, will produce 2 phenoxy ethanol, a topical antiseptic, which when oxidized, results in phenoxyacetic acid, a fungicide.Similarly, the formaldehyde acetal wherein RÚ and Rê are 2, 4, 5 trichlorophenyl will yield, in accordance with this process, 2, 4, 5 tricholophenoxyacetic acid, an herbicide. In a like manner, whenRÚ and Rê are p nonylphenyl, p nonylphenoxyacetic acid, a corrosion inhibitor and antifoaming agent in gasoline and cutting oils will be formed.Each of these aforedescribed products may be recovered routinely by methods well known in the art.The invention will now be illustrated by, but is not intended to be limited to, the following examples. EXAMPLES Examples 1 21A series of runs was carried out in which the following general procedure was employed, using as the catalyst a mixture of Co2 CO 8 and Ru3 CO 12, or Co2 CO 8 alone for comparative purposes . In the table below, it should be noted that whereas addition of Ru3 CO 12 caused an increase in production of the glycolether, B, over that obtained with CO2 CO 8 alone, other metal carbonyls had no such effect. To a 300 ml stainless steel autoclave equipped with a magnedrive stirrer was charged methylal, solvent if any , and catalyst. Carbon monoxide, 800 psig, and hydrogen, 1600 psig, were admitted and the reaction mixture was rapidly heated to the desired temperature. The mixture was stirred for the designated time at reaction temperature after which the reactor was cooled by immersion in an ice bath. When the contents reached 250C the final pressure was recorded. After venting the gas the liquid was analyzed by GLPC.The results are reported in Table I below. Reaction conditions, amounts, and the use of solvents were varied in accordance with the data set forth in this table.

Filtration of the orange solid followed by drying in vacuo gave a material which exhibited characteristic metal carbonyl bands in the infrared but was neitherCo2 CO 8 nor Ru3 CO 12. The ir bands in the isolated solid were at 4.83, 4.92 and 4.98u. The bridging carbonyl of the starting Co2 CO 8 5.37u had totally disappeared in forming the new act.ive complex.

It can be seen from the tabulated results of Table III that running the reaction in a solvent such as n butyl alcohol or o dichlorobenzene gives generally superior yields to running the reaction in neat CH2 0Bu 2.In Table III, the examples were conducted in accordance with the following general procedure Dicobalt octacarbonyl, 4 mmoles, triruthenium dodecacarbonyl, 4 mmoles,CH2 0Bu 2 in the amount listed in the table and solvent in the amount listed in the table were charged to a 300 ml stirred autoclave to which 3200 psi of a 1 1 mixture of CO and H2 were abided and then heated to 1500C for 3 4 hrs.
