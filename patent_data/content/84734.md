# Membrane switch with sequentially closeable contacts.

## Abstract
Membrane switch 2 comprises a substrate 12 having first 4 , second 6 , and third 8 switch contacts thereon. A flexible insulating film 16 extends parallel to the substrate 12 and has a commoning conductor 26 on its underside. The flexible film has first 30 and second 32 contact projec tions extending towards the substrate, the first contact projec tion 30 being against the first switch contact 4 and the sec ond contact projection 32 being spaced from the second switch contact 6 . A pair of supporting projections 34, 36 ex tend from the film 16 and bear against the surface 10 of the substrate at locations adjacent to the switch contacts 4, 6, 8 . The film is supported by the first contact projection 30 and the pair of supporting projections 34, 36 . When the film 16 is pressed towards the substrate 12 , the second contact pro jection 32 sequentially moves against the second switch con tact 16 and thereafter the commoning conductor 26 is moved against the third switch contact 8 .
