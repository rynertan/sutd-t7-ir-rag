# TRUCK

## Abstract
Trucks of the rolling container type are frequently used for the handling and transport of non returnable packages for, e.g. milk. The trucks generally have three side walls and an openable fourth side wall or gate. In the automatic handling and loading of rolling containers the handling of the gate constitutes a problem, and the gate, moreover, is frequently exposed to damage which impairs its function. In order to overcome this difficulty, the gate in the rolling container in accordance with the invention has been re placed by retaining bars which terminate each shelf 7 at its free end. The retaining bars 10 extend upwards as well as downwards from the shelf plane and thus come into contact with the upper as well as the lower end of the packing containers placed in the rolling container, as a result of which the packing containers are effectively prevented from falling off the shelves during the handling of the rolling container.
