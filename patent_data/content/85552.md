# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ZIRCONIUM ALLOYS

## Abstract
Alpha zirconium alloy fabrication methods and resultant products exhibiting improved high temperature, high press ure steam corrosion resistance. The process, according to one aspect of this invention, utilizes a high energy beam thermal treatment to provide a layer of beta treated micros tructure on an alpha zirconium alloy intermediate product. The treated product is then alpha worked to final size. According to another aspect of the invention, high energy beam thermal treatment is used to produce an alpha annealed microstructure in a Zircaloy alloy intermediate size or final size component. The resultant products are suitable for use in pressurized water and boiling water reactors.
