# Electro optical velocity measuring system.

## Abstract
An electro optical system for the noncontact measure ment of the velocity of a diffusely scattering surface is de scribed. In one embodiment of the invention, a linearly po larized monochromatic light beam 22 is converted into two orthogonally polarized beams 44, 46 which also have a frequency difference induced between them. The two beams are directed so that they intersect at the moving sur face 56 to be measured such that there is a predetermined angle between the beams in the plane containing the veloc ity vector of the moving surface. Light scattered 58 by the surface from both of the incident beams is picked up by a pair of photosensors 74, 76 . The difference between the output of the two photosensors is a signal which is indepen dent of scattering direction and is directly proportional to the velocity of the moving surface in the plane determied by the two incident beams. Measurements of substantially im proved dynamic range for the primary velocity signal and a zero primary velocity signal at zero surface velocity are obtained by using an optical up down frequency shifter to generate the two beams which illuminate the moving surface.

## Description
TitleELECTRO OPTICAL VELOCITY MEASURING SYSTEMBackground of the InventionField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to an electro optical system for the noncontact measurement of the velocity of a diffusely scattering surface. More particularly, the invention relates to a system which employs dual laser or light beam illumination including not only means for providing a velocity bias so that the primary velocity signal is non zero at zero velocity but also means for providing substantially improved dynamic range for the primary velocity signal.The Prior ArtFor the accurate measurement of the velocity of soft, elicate, hot, or moving objects, a noncontacting velocimeter is desirable because contacting sensors 1 may slip on the surface being measured,2 may distort or damage the surface being measured, 3 may not be able to maintain contact due to the erratic motion of the object being measured, or 4 may be destroyed due to the erratic, violent motion of the object being measured. Prior art noncontacting velocimeters employ various techniques namely, moving pattern method, 2 direct Doppler method, and 3 differential Doppler method.The moving pattern method uses a beam of coherent light, usually from a laser, to illuminate the diffusely scattering surface to be measured.If the light scattered by the moving surface is imaged onto a viewing screen, a granular pattern is observed which appears to move at a rate related to the velocity of the surface. The rate of motion of the pattern can be measured by passing it through a grating comprised of alternating opaque and transparent straight, equally spaced parallel bands oriented perpendicular to the direction of motion of the pattern.The intensity of the light transmitted through the grating is modulated at a frequency which is proportional to the rate of motion of the pattern. The modulation frequency can be measured using a photoelectric detector and suitable electronic circuitry. The velocity component of the surface to be measured can then be computed. Flower, et al.,U.S. Patent 3,432,237 issued March 11, 1969 discloses a velocimeter based on this method.While the moving pattern method has certain advantages, it suffers from a serious disadvantage arising from the fact that the relationship between the surface and the pattern motion is sensitive to the angular orientation of the surface. Thusly, this method is susceptivle to errors which are proportional, to first order, to the product of the change in orientation and the distance between the illumination spot on the surface and the grating.Another prior art technique, the direct Doppler method, is based on measuring the frequency shift, i.e., the Doppler shift, of a beam of light after it is scattered from a moving surface. The magnitude of the Doppler shift is proportional to a velocity component of the surface which scattered the light. The Doppler shift can be measured by heterodyning the scattered light with the unshifted light from the same light source.While the direct Doppler method has certain advantages, it suffers from a serious disadvantage arising from the fact that the condition for an optimal signal and maximal intensitivity to changes in the angle of the surface requires that the illumination be perpendicular to the surface.Unfortunately, very often it is desirable to measure the velocity component of the surface in the direction parallel to the surface. For this requirement, perpendicular illumination does not provide the information about the velocity component of interest.Another prior art technique, the differential Doppler method, disclosed in Penney, et al., U.S. Patent 3,604,804 issued September 14, 1971, is based on nearly illumination. This technique overcomes some of the aforementioned disadvantages of the direct Doppler method.Nevertheless, the apparatus disclosed in the Penney patent has several inherent disadvantages. Firstly, the primary velocity signal is zero at zero surface velocity. In practice, this requires that only surface velocity above a non zero limit can be measured. Secondly, bedause of the wide distribution in the sizes of the spatial characteristics of the surface being measured, there is a large, wildly fluctuating low frequency light signal at the photosensor which severely limits the dynamic range of this type apparatus.The use of a frequency shifter to introduce a frequency shift to permit the measurement of zero and negative velocities has been part of the prior art in Doppler velocimeters used in gas dynamic particle studies, e.g., the one described in the article Laser Doppler Velocimeters by L.M.Fingerson, Laser Focus, August 1982, pp. 53 56. Nevertheless, measuring the speed of a diffusely scattering moving surface is substantially more difficult than measuring the speed of gas particles. The approach discussed in the aforementioned arS cle is both very expensive and does not solve the problems addressed by the instant invention.While these prior art techniques are useful for some applications, they cannot be used for many industrial applicationr For example, in a rolling mill it is frequently necessary to measure the length, i.e. the integral of the velocity, of an object whose velocity ranges over a wide range including zero velocity. For example, the shear to length operation in a bloom mill operates down to zero velocity, and, in fact, requires a range which can handle sligthly negative velocities.Object of the InventionIn view of the foregoing, it is the main object of this invention to provide an electro optical system for the noncontact measurement of the velocity of a diffusely scattering surface in which the primary velocity signal is not zero at zero surface velocity.Also an object of the invention is to provide an electro optical system with a large dynamic range for the primary velocity signal. Another object of the invention is to provide an electro optical system of relatively simple design which operates reliably and which can be operated with a minimum of field adjustments.Statement of the InventionIn accord with one embodiment of the instant invention, the noncontact velocity measuring system includes 1 a source of a beam of linearly polarized monochromatic radiant energy, such as a laser, 2 a means for converting said linearly polarized beam into two coincident, orthogonally polarized beams which also have a frequency difference induced between them, 3 means for splitting said beam into two orthogonally polarized separate beams each of which is linearly polarized and contains radiant energy of only one frequency, 4 means for directing said two separate beams such that they intersect at and are incident upon a diffusely scattering moving surface such that there is a predetermind angle between the beams in the plane which contains the velocity vector of the moving surface, 5 means for collecting the radiation scattered by the surface from said incident beams, 6 means for splitting said scattered radiation into two beams, 7 means for mixing the orthogonally polarized components in each of the two scattered beams such that the primary velocity signals in the two scattered beams are 180 degrees out of phase with each other, 8 means for photosensing said two beams, 9 means for subtracting the one photosignal from the other, and 10 means for converting said difference signal to an output proportional to the velocity of the moving surface. Preferably, the system includes known means to convert the cross section of said coincident beams into an elliptical cross section with its long axis parallel to the velocity of the surface to produce a signal with a higher signal to noise ratio and a narrower velocity spectrum than with a circular cross section. The DrawingsIn the drawings, Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of the optical system of the instant invention.Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of the optical up down frequency shifter in Fig. 1.Figure 3 is a block diagram of the electronic circuitry for processing the signals produced by the photosensors in the system shown in Fig. 1.Detailed Description of the InventionWhile the technique has application for a wide range of radiation sources, the following description is taken by way of example with respect to an optical measuring system. The term radiant energy as used herein includes, but is not limited to, electromagnetic energy of all frequency ranges.Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, a laser 20 produces a narrow beam of linearly polarized, monochromatic light 22 of frequency iJ . The beam 22 passes through the up down frequency shifter 24 which is described in more detail in the description of Fig. 2. Beam 26 is split into two beams 34 and 35 by beamsplitter 28 which is partially transmissive and partially reflective. The polarizer plate 30 mixes the orthogonally polarized coincident components of beam 35 to produce beam 31 . Photosensor 32 then provides a reference signal with a frequency 4 u , the frequency difference induced by the up down frequency shifter 24 between the orthogonally polarized components of beam 26 .The anamorphic beam expander 38 converts the circular cross section of beam 34 into a beam 40 which has an elliptical cross section with its major axis parallel to the velocity vector of the surface.The elliptical cross section has the advantages of producing an enhanced signal to noise ratio and a narrower velocity spectrum. Woolaston prism 42 separates the orthogonally polarized components of beam 40 into two beams 44 and 46 whose directions ofpropagation differ by a small angle. Lenses 50 and 54 and beamsplitter 52 divert the beams 44 and 46 so that they intersect at the diffusely scattering surface 56 . The velocity V, of surface 56 is shown by the arrow inFig. 1. The light scattered by the surface 56 from the incident beams is shown invfigures as the dashed rays 58 . The scattered light 58 is collected by lens 54 and is transmitted by beamsplitter 52 to provide beam 62 . Lens 64 transforms beam 62 into a converging beam 66 which is split into a pair of beams 70 and 72 by beamsplitter 68 .Beams 70 and 72 pass through polarizers 73 and 75 . Polarizers 73 and 75 mix the orthogonally polarized components in beams 70 and 72 , respectively. The optic axes of polarizers 73 and 75 are oriented so that signals in photosensors 74 and 76 are 180 degrees out of phase.Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of the optical up down frequency shifter 24 . The up down frequency shifter 24 is placed in the linearly polarized, monochromatic beam 22 in order to 1 convert the linearly polarized beam 22 into two orthogonally polarized, coincident beams, 2 induce a frequency shift between these two orthogonally polarized beams such that the frequency of one is w 2 and the frequeny of the other is cl 2tJ where is the frequency of beam 22 and 4 is the difference frequency between the two orthogonally polarized beams, and 3 accomplish 1 and 2 with good efficiency, i.e. nominally 50 of beam 22 goes into each orthogonally polarized beam .In one embodiment, up down frequency shifter 24 is comprised of a rotating half wave retardation plate 82 . Half wave plate 82 is rotated by a device 80 at a frequency w . Device 80 can be a motor with a through hole in its shaft. Theresulatantbeam 83 then passes through a quarter wave retardation plate 84 to producebem 26 which is comprised of two coincident, linearly orthogonally polarized beams 26A and 26B each with frequency w 2w and tq 2 , respectively. Mechanical rotation of the half wave plate 82 can provide frequency shift, 4 of up to 2 5 KHz between the two orthogonally polarized beams. When greater frequency shifts are desired, the mechanical rotation of the half wave plate can be replaced by an equivalent electro optical device.The range to which the apparatus can measure velocities on both sides of zero velocity is determined by the magnitude of the frequency shift.For the instant invention, negative velocities up to nominally 1 of the positive velocity limit can be measured. By rotating quarterwave retardation plate 84 by 90 degrees, the velocity range can be flipped about zero velocity to provide a significant negative velocity range. This can be done either manually or automatically.Figure 3 is a block diagram of the electronic circuitry for processing the signals produced by the photosensors 74 and 76 in order to yield an output signal proportional to the velocity of the surface 56 . Preamplifiers 90 and 92 convert the photocurrents from photosensors 74 and 76 to electrical signals 91 and 93 .Difference amplifier 94 subtracts signal 91 from signal 93 to produce signal 95 so that the large, spurios low frequency components present in signals 91 and 93 are eliminated from signal 95 . Furthermore, since the surface velocity frequency shift signals are 180 degrees out of phase in signals 91 and 93 , the subtraction amplifier 94 not only substantially eliminates the large, spurios low frequency components but it also enhances the quality of the primary velocity signal.The analog signal 95 is passed through an anti aliasing filter 96 to eliminate any signal components above the Nyquist limit of one half the sampling frequency. The sample and hold circuit 98 and the analog to digital converter 100 change the continuous analog signal 97 to a series of digital values 101 which are stored in a digital memory 102 . When the memory contains the correct number of digital values for the Fast Fourier Transform, FFT, processor, the contents 103 of the digital memory 102 are transferred to the FFT processor 104 which calculates the frequeny spectrum of the signal. The frequency spectrum 105 is then transferred to the microprocessor lid6 which finds the frequency of the peak which is proportional to the velocity of the moving surface.The signal from photosensor 32 is passed through an amplifier 110 which provides a signal 111 suitable for the frequency counter 112 .The microprocessor 106 calculates the velocity of the surface by subtracting the frequency shift 113 measured by the frequency counter 112 from the frequency of the peak of the frequency spectrum 105 and multiplying by a constant to obtain the velocity output 107 in conventient units, e.g. feet second. Velocity output 107 can be used with a visual digital display not shown or as an input to a computer for process control.Obviously, changes can be made in the implementation of the signal processing. Depending on the cost and speed of available components, it may be desirable to share the processing among a combination using more than one sample and hold 98 , analog to digital converter 100 digital memory 102 , FFT processor 104 , or microprocessor 106 . It may also be desirable to change the division of processing between the FFT processor 104 and microprocessor 106 or combine them into one unit.The device described herein has significant advantages over prior art devices. In particular, the splitting of the laser beam into two orthogonally polarized beams of nominally equal intensity to illuminate the moving surface permits the generation of two out of phase signals, using polarization techniques, which can be subtracted to provide a substantially improved range for the primary velocity signal. In addition, the use of an optical up down frequency shifter provides a velocity bias so that zero and negative velocities can be measured. Obviously, changes can be made in the embodiment of the invention illustrated, and the invention as defined in the claims.
