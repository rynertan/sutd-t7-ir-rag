## Description
Hull configurationThe invention relates to a displacement type hull configuration which makes it possible to improve a vessel s deadweight tonnage, transverse stability, navigational and sailing properties and to reduce stresses on the hull beam whether the vessel is sailing in quiet water or into the waves.At given main dimensions of length, breadth and depth to the design waterline, conventional hull configurations can obtain greater deadweight tonnage by increasing the roundness of the underwater portion of the hull, thereby increasing the total displacement.To improve the transverse stability of a conventionally formed hull, expressed as a higher initial metacenter, the breadth of the hull can be increased to obtain a greater moment of inertia at the waterline, optionally also raising the volumetric center of gravity of the underwater hull.However, changes of this nature increasing roundness and breadth , as demands for transverse stability and speed increase, will eventually result in an unacceptable increase in a conventional vessel s resistance to propulsion in quiet waters as well as in heavy waves.To improve the seagoing properties of a conventional hull configuration, expressed as the vessel s angular movements about a transverse axis pitching2, vertical movements heave and the amount of increase in propulsion resistance compared to the resistance in quiet seas, one seeks to alter the vessel s natural frequency of pitching and heaving so that this frequency insofar as possible does not coincide with the frequency of the wave lengths which the vessel encounters.In the case of conventional hull designs, structural alterations result in only slight improvements in the seagoing properties of the vessel, and extreme pitching and heaving movements and a great increase in the resistance to propulsion will occur when the ship is sailing into the waves when the prevailing wave length is approximately equal to the ship s length at the waterline.Depending on the type of vessel and its rate of speed, such synchronous movements always make it necessary for a conventional ship to reduce speed or alter course in relation to the waves, thereby altering the cycles of encounter with the waves so that the wave period does not coincide with the natural frequency of the vessel s pitching and heaving.Conventional hull configurations having an approximately rectangular displacement distribution will be subjected, as a function of increasing size, to bending and shear stresses which necessitate very large dimension materials and in special cases also restrict the distribution of cargo and or ballast.In accordance with the present invention, the deadweight tonnage, transverse stability, seagoing properties and the magnitude of tolerable bending and shear stresses on the hull beam can all be improved without incurring the above drawbacks. The invention permits the hull to be made with rounder lines than conventional hull configurations, expressed by the term for leanness of line L Vl 3, whereL is the length of the hull at the design waterline corresponding to the depth T to the summer freeboard and V is the displacement volume of the hull at the design waterline, and where L V1 3 can be about 3 or greater than 3 without increasing the specific resistance to propulsion compared to conventional hull configurations, while at the same time the hull breadth B can be increased such that the L B ratio can be about 2 or greater than 2, where B is the maximum breadth of the hull at the design waterline, whereby the height of the metacenter of the hull can be more than doubled in relation to conventional hull configurations of the same length.At the critical wave length hull length ratio for conventional hull configurations sailing into the waves, the seagoing properties of the hull configuration of the invention are improved, such that the hull s pitching and heaving movements are reduced compared to the movements of conventional hulls traveling at the same rate of speed, and these movements are also retarded such that the improved hull does not exhibit correspondingly large movements until the wave length hull length ratio is more than twice as large, while at the same time the improved hull s resistance to propulsion is reduced to a similar degree.According to the invention, the displacement distribution in the longitudinal direction approximates a Rayleigh wave which with normal distribution of cargo will result in a reduction of the longitudinal moment of bending on the hull beam of around 50 compared to conventional hulls. To obtain the abovesaid improvements, the hull configuration according to the invention must be formed with squarely cut off, approximately harmonic sinusoidal waterlines dwl, 1,2, 3 with extremity points at the ends of the hull fore and aft, while at the same time the base lines of the waterlines dwl 1t 2t 3 from the design waterline dwl and at increasing depths from this, gradually are displaced in the direction of forward propulsion and shortened so that an approximately oblique plane s , straight or approximately sinusoidal in longitudinal cross section and with extremity points around L 2 and at the hull s stern end, forms a wide, elevated surface s which comprises the stern half of the hull, and which thus permits utilization of a propulsion system characteristic for this hull configuration consisting of a support plane p extending transversely in the horizontal plane across the full breadth of the hull, having a streamlined shape, and being fixed or rotatable about a horizontal axis in connection with supports q , optionally provided with one or more horizontal rudders h at the aft edge, and wherein a plurality of propulsion units f are mounted at the fore or aft wedge of the support plane, above or beneath it.According to the invention, a transverse section through the hull configuration below the design waterline dwl at a distance of about 0.15 L from the stern, will have a ratio between the breadth B 1 at the design waterline and the depth t1 of the hull measured from the same waterline which will be about 3 or greater than the corresponding ratio for a section at L 2 where the breadth B2 and depth t2 are measured in the same way. As a result of the invention, the hull parameter e c c dwl p will be about 1 or greater than 1, where cp is defined as the hull s longitudinal prismatic. coefficient expressed as the ratio between the displacement volume V to the design waterline and the volume of a body equal to the area of a transverse section up to the design waterline at L 2, designated AL 2 multiplied by the design waterline L, which may be expressed by the equation cp V e 2 L, L, and where Cdwl is the waterline coefficient for the design waterline, defined as the ratio between the waterline area Adwl and the product L B where B is the maximum breadth at the waterline, which may be expressed by the equation Cdwl Adwl LBAs a result of the invention, the design waterline s areal center of gravity LCF will be located around 0.2 L aft of L 2 and the improved hull s volumetric center of gravity buoyancy LCB at the depth of the design waterline dwl around 0.075 L forward of the areal center of gravity, which may be expressed as LCF LCB N 0.075 L.The hull configuration according to the invention can in the region from the stern post and forward to about 0.3 L be provided with turbulence controlling appendages which may consist of fixed or flexible fin like means v in the streamline direction mounted approximately perpendicular relative to the hull and located approximately at the transition between the bottom and sides of the hull, or as longitudinal grooves in the form of pointed, rectangular or wave like grooves x which decrease in depth in the direction of forward propulsion and which at about 0.3 L terminate in and coincide with the even portion of the oblique plane s and whose depth d will usually be about 0.02 B.The improved hull configuration of the invention is shown in the accompanying figures 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7.Figure 1 shows the improved hull configuration s squarely cut off, approximately harmonic sinusoidal waterlines around the design waterline dwl with extremity points around the hull s bow and stern ends, with the areal center of gravity LCF about 0.2 L astern of L 2 and where the length breadth ratio L B of the design waterline is shown as being about 2.Figure 2 shows the improved hull below the design waterline dwl in vertical section, where it may be seen that the base lines of the squarely cut off, approximately harmonic sinusoidal waterlines dwl l 2 3 along the oblique plane s , which are displaced in the direction of forward propulsion of the vessel,coincide with the base plane g at about L 2, and the distance between the areal center of gravity LCF and the buoyancy center of gravity LCB of the hull at the depth of the design waterline dwl is about 0.075 L.Figure 3 shows the improved hull configuration of Figure 2 in horizontal projection with the waterlines dwl, 1,2,3 and g, in this example with a U frame at the bow end of the hull, but other known frame forms can also be utilized, as required.Figure 3 also shows the characteristic ratio between breadth and depth for a section around 0.1 L from the stern and at L 2, where the respective breadths and depths are designatedB1 and B2 and tl and t2.Figure 4 shows a vertical section near the center plane in the hulls aft section with the base plane g , oblique plane s , support q , support plane ply, horizontal rudder h , propulsion units f and vertical rudder r , in this case shown with the propulsion unit f positioned in front of and underneath the support plane p , but the thrusters can also be mounted at the aft end or above the support plane.Figure 5 shows a section parallel to and below the oblique plane s , support plane p , supports q , horizontal rudders h , the overlying contour of the design waterline dwl and the propulsion units f , in this example four in number and mounted at the forward edge of the support plane.
