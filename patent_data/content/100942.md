# Apparatus and method for producing shot free mineral wool.

## Abstract
An apparatus and dry method for de shotting shot containing mineral wool fibers wherein the fibers are treated in a granulator to compact them into entangled nodules, and the nodules are passed through an air classifier to open up and de shot them, In a preferred embodiment, a feted layer of mineral wool is subjected to a first granulation step to divide the layer into a multiplicity of lightly compacted nodules which are then partially de shotted, and the partially de shotted nodules are subjected to a second granulation step to more tightly compact the nodules before they are introduced into the air classifier,
