# An air valve conduit in the track wall of a tire.

## Abstract
Tires are typically inflated through an air conduit mounted on the tire carcass and extending through a hole in the metal rim on which the tire is mounted. Now and then relative slipping between the tire and rim has caused the air conduit to be sheared off, deflating the tire. The present invention overcomes this problem by moving the air conduit 26, 33, 37 completely away from the rim. The air conduit 26, 33, 37 extends from the air chamber 12 through the track wall 10 to the side wall 8 of the carcass 7 and terminates in an air valve receptacle 27 accessible at the side wall 8 of the carcass 7 .
