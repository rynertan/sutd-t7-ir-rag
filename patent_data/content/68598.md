# Dual phase structured hot rolled high tensile strength steel sheet and a method of producing the same.

## Abstract
A dual phase structured hot rolled steel sheet hav ing a composition consisting of 0.03 0.15 by weight of C, 0.6 1.8 by weight of Mn, 0.04 0.2 by weight of P, not more than 0.10 of Aâ„“, not more than 0.008 by weight of S, and the remainder being substantially Fe, and having a microstructure consisting of ferrite and martensite dispersed therein, the area fraction of said ferrite being at least 70 and that of said martensite being at least 5 at the section of the steel sheet, has a high tensile strength and a low yield ratio of not higher than 70 , and has excellent formability. The steel sheet can be produced in a simple manner by cooling directly a hot rolled sheet at an ordinary cooling rate without the use of a particular cooling pattern.
