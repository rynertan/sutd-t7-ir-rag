# Process for producing propylene copolymer.

## Abstract
A process for producing a propylene copolymer having improved transparency and rigidity comprises carrying out A the polymerization of a vinyl cycloalkane having at least 6 carbon atoms, e.g. cyclopentane or cyclohexane, and B the polymerization of propylene either alone or with ethy lene, in at least two steps in the presence of a catalyst system composed of a titanium compound, e.g. TiClâ‚ƒ, and an organoaluminum compound, e.g. an alkyl aluminium chloride . The content of the vinyl cycloalkane unit in the resulting copolymer is 0.05 to 10,000 weight ppm.
