# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO TABLET MAKING MACHINES

## Abstract
A tablet making machine includes a rotor 10 , one end, preferably the lower end, of which is detachably secured to a rotatable member of the machine so that the rotor rotates with the rotatable member in use of the machine the configuration of the rotor being such that when it is detached from the rotatable member the rotor can be removed from the machine by generally horizontal sliding movement. The rotor may thus be easily and quickly removed from the machine by detaching the rotor from the rotatable member and sliding the rotor horizontally from the machine, thus significantly reducing the time taken to clean the machine between batches of tablets may be reduced and enabling ready replacement of punches and or dies that are damaged or worn. Further, an alternative rotor with different punches can be substituted very quickly. In this way, machine downtime may be significantly reduced.
