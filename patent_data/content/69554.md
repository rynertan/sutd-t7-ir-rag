# TEST PATTERN GENERATORS

## Abstract
A test pattern generator comprises vertical line pulse generating circuit 20 for generating a first pulse train VL and a second pulse train Hi , the first pulse train being used to display vertical lines on a raster scan display apparatus and including, between successive pulses of the second pulse train, a number of pulses equal to the number of vertical lines. A horizontal sync pulse generating circuit 30 receives the second pulse train and generating a horizontal sync pulse train M sync . A vertical blanking and sync pulse generating circuit 40, 42, 44, 46 is connected to the horizontal sync pulse generating circuit for generating a vertical sync pulse train V sync and a vertical blanking pulse train Vb , and a horizontal line pulse generating circuit 50 tu generates a horizontal line pull train HL , used to display horizontal lines, in response to the horizontal sync pulse train and the vertical blanking pulse train.
