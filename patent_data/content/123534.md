# Process for the production of oxygenated organic compounds such as methanol.

## Abstract
A process for the production of an oxygenated organic product, such as methanol, from a feedstock containing car bon, comprising the steps of a gasifying the feedstock with high purity oxygen to obtain a raw synthesis gas stream comprising methane, hydrogen, and carbon oxides b mix ing the raw synthesis gas stream with a hydrogen rich gas stream to form a final synthesis gas stream c injecting the final synthesis gas stream into a synthesis loop, forming the oxygenated organic product in the loop and extracting from the loop a purge gas stream d separating the purge gas cryogenically to form the hydrogen rich gas stream, an argon rich gas stream, and a methane rich gas stream and e recycling the hydrogen rich gas stream to step b .
