# Portable thermal printer.

## Abstract
A printer 1 employs an optical reading means 11 such as a pen scanner or touch scanner as data input means, and the operator only has to hold the pen scanner or whatever optical scanning means is used, the other parts being held around the operator s waist W or the like. Therefore, the operator can use both hands to handle articles of freight, such as boxes, therefore enabling freight to be handled and labels printed easily and efficiently. In addition, the arrangement of the thermal label roll R and thermal printing means 20 enables the overall unit to be made more light and compact.
