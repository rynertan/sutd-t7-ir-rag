## Description
PROCESSOR PURIFYING A COPOLYMER A COPOLYMER CONTINING ACRYLONITRILE GROUPS The invention relates to a process for purifying a copolymer containing acrylonitrile groups. Examples of copolymers containing acrylonitrile groups are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymers ABS and styreneacrylonitrile copolymers SAN . After the polymerization such copolymers contain all sorts of impurities, particularly unconverted acrylonitrile.The impurity present in all copolymers containing acrylonitrile groups is the acrylonitrile that allows itself to be virtually completely removed from such copolymers with very great difficulty. This removal of acrylonitrile must be very thorough in view of the high toxicity of this material. The present invention provides a very simple and yet effective solution for purifying copolymers containing acrylonitrile groups.According to the invention a process for purifying copolymers containing acrylonitrile groups is characterized in that, per kg impurities in the copolymer, the copolymer is treated with at least 1 Nm3 NPT of an extractant chosen from substances the critical temperature of which is lower than 435 K, at a temperature higher than 0.9 time the critical temperature of the extractant and at a pressure higher than 0.9 time the critical pressure of the extractant. Here and elsewhere in the text and in the claims Nm3 NPT is understood to mean the number of m3 of the relative substance measured at a pressure of 1 bar and a temperature of 273 K.Suitable examples of these substances are S02, N20, NO, CO, CH4,N2, CO2, ethylene and propylene and mixtures of these components among themselves and or with less than 50 vol other components, which mixtures must have a critical temperature lower than 470 K. Of these examples most preference is given to CO2 and ethylene. The fact is that C02 and ethylene are highly effective extractants which are very cheap and readily available. Critical temperature and critical pressure are understood in this connection to mean the temperature and the pressure going with the gas liquid critical point. A very effective duration of the treatment using the extractant is between 0.1 minute and 5 hours, preferably between 5 minutes and 5 hours. A longer duration of the treatment is possible, but does not result in an appreciably better degree of purification. A very effective temperature for the treatment using the extractant is between 0.9 time the critical temperature of the extractant and 600 K, preferably between 290 and 470 K. A very effective pressure for the treatment using the extractant is between 0.9 time the critical pressure of the extractant and, prompted only by practical considerations such as high costs of extremepressure equipment, 10 times the critical pressure of the extractant, preferably between 65 and 500 bar. A very effective amount of extractant per kg impurities in the copolymer to be purified is between 1 and 1500 Nm3 NPT . A lower amount of extractant results in too low a degree of purification and a higher amount only results in an increase in costs and not in an appreciably better degree of purification. Preference is given to using at least 40 Nm3 extractant per kg impurities in the copolymer to be purified. A major advantage of the process according to the invention is the substantial improvement of the heat distortion temperature HDT of the purified copolymer containing acrylonitrile groups compared with theHDT of the copolymer containing acrylonitrile groups before the purification.
