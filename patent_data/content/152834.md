# Apparatus for automatic measurement of stress in a transparent body by means of scattered light.

## Abstract
Apparatus to be used directly on a flat sheet of transpar ent material, more especially tempered glass. for simultaneous measurement of sign and amplitude of stress across the sec tion of said glass sheet by means of scattered light. The apparatus allows reliable and repetitive measure ments independently of the operator s subjective observa tions, as data reading is through an automatic system. The ap paratus substantially comprises a Helium Neon He Ne laser source 1 to 5 mW, whose light beam is linearly polarized. then modulated with a series of wave plates 2, 2 , 2 , after which it passes through a collimator 3 and subsequently strikes a prism 4 optically coupled with the glass sheet V under test. Variation in intensity of the interference fringes is re vealed by a TV camera 5 consisting of a macrophotographic lens system 5 which focusses the scattered light on a solid state array photodetector 5 . The photosensitive zone of the detector is positioned to detect insensity of the scattered light along path BC of the la ser beam through the section of the glass sheet V under test. An electronic circuit can thus convert the video signals transmitted by the aforesaid TV camera 5 .
