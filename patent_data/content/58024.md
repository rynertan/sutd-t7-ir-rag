# A VALVE

## Abstract
A valve 3 for a beverage tap comprises a valve member 10 of a resiliently deformable material which coacts with a frusto conical valve seat 9. A valve actuating mechanism 4 is connected by a rod 12 to the valve member 10 and when operated deforms the member 10 away from the valve seat 9 to allow fluid flow through the valve. Employing the natural resilience of the valve member 10 to open and close the valve simplifies the operation and construction of the valve.
