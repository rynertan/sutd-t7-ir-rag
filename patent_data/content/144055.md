# Process and apparatus for producing a continuous insulated metallic substrate.

## Abstract
A process for producing a continuous web of an insulated metalic substrate, comprising the steps of deposit ing an insulation layer on a continuous web of a metalic substrate by plasma CVD method or sputtering method, and depositing a back electrode on the insulation layer by sputtering method or vapor deposition method. According to the present invention, the insulated metalic substrate for a solar cell or printed circuit board can be produced in a continuous manner and in high productivity and quality.
