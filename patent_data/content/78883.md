## Abstract
A double inclined shaft kiln, which calcines limestone, dolomite, magnesite, and other similar materials, in which ore materials are charged into the furnace from the top of the vertical external cylinder 3 and are calcined by burners 5 installed in the lower part of the shaft. An injector 15 causes the hot gas to flow into the lower calcining zone 13 parallel to the flow of ore materials. A partition wall 17 is provided in the upper and lower calcining zones. A solid fuel hot gas generator 16 is installed outside the furnace. Combustion air for the hot gas generator 16 is provided from cooling zone 14 and via the injector 15 from the lower calcining zone 13 .
