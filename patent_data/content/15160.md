# Electric cable installations.

## Abstract
In an oil filled electric power cable installation, the oil is pressurised using oil tanks 13 connected to stop joints 11 in the usual way, and an oil purifying unit is connected between stop joint and tank. The oil purifying unit comprises a column or bed 1 of a molecular sieve or other active purifying agent with particle sizes, and interstice sizes, big enough to limit the pressure drop across the unit to 20 KN mÂ² at the most. This eliminates the need to provide bypass passages controlled by valves as the oil can flow both ways through the column.
