# Water soluble vegetable protein aggregates, a process for the production thereof and food recipes containing them.

## Abstract
Aqueous protein dispersions obtained from vegetable sources are subjected to successive pressure and cavitation cycling e.g, centrifugal homogenization at temperatures below the protein heat denaturization and under slightly alkaline pH s e.g., pH 7.0 8.0 to provide a high NSI product. These high NSI products may be dried to provide a vegetable seed product having functional properties and utility similar to milk proteins. Buffered salt extracts from such spray dried products reveal a predominant restructuring of the protein constituents into high molecular weight protein aggregates. Low NSI soy concentrates obtained by aqueous alcohol extraction procosses are converted into a high NSI product possessing many of the desirable functional attributes of soy isolates plus those of milk proteins.
