# Radiation image read out method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a radiation image read out system in which a stimulable phosphor sheet carrying a radiation image stored thereon is exposed to stimulating rays which causes it to emit light in the pattern of the stored image, and the emitted light is photoelectrically read out, the interval between the radiation image recording on the stimulable phosphor sheet and preliminary read out is measured, the image input information detected by the preliminary read out is corrected according to the interval measured, and the final read out conditions and or the image processing conditions are set based on the corrected image input information. To deter mine the interval, a bar code label for identifying the phosphor sheet is attached thereto, and the time when the recording thereon is conducted is stored in a memory with respect to the bar code label. Or, a magnetic recording medium is attached to the phosphor sheet, and the recording time is recorded on the medium and read out therefrom at the time of preliminary read out.
