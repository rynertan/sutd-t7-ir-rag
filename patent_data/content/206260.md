# Injection molding machine for small sized article.

## Abstract
An injection molding machine for small sized articles of thermoplastic synthetic resin comprises a hydraulically pres surizable injection head cylinder operable on an injection cylin der of an injection unit for injecting molding material into a mold, a hydraulically pressurizable clamping cylinder operable on one of a pair of mold members of the mold for opening and closing the mold, and a booster operatively connected to both the injection head cylinder and the clamping cylinder for con verting pneumatic pressure into high hydraulic pressure to ac tuate the two cylinders in timed relation to each other.
