# SPOOL MOUNTING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A spool mounting apparatus, particularly suitable for automatic, unbuffered tape transport systems, permits a reduction in the handling of spools during loading sequ ences. A spool inserted through an opening 12 into a cavity 20 within a housing 10 , is guided into a preliminary position by a detent pin 26 . The opening possesses a spring biassed closure member 13 , which is mechanically linked to a free running disc member 40 within the cavity 20 situated opposite a shaped cylindrical hub 30 over which the spool may locate. Motion of the spring biassed closure member 13 towards a closed position effects displacement of the free running disc member 40 towards the hub 30 , thereby clamping the spool disposed therebetween. Subsequent rotation applied to the hub 30 is therefore transferred to the clamped spool and the free running member 40 .
