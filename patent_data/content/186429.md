# Radial field electromagnetic flow meter.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a radial field electromagnetic flow meter comprising, as a main part of a radial magnetic flux generator, a magnet device 4, 5, 3, 2c surrounded by a fluid passage 8 for fluid to be measured and electrically insu lated magnetic poles separately positioned on a center line of the fluid passage, and further comprising, as a remainder portion of the radial field generator, a tubular part 1, 2a surrounding a range including the mutually opposite mag netic poles of the magnet device through the fluid passage 8 , and ribs 2b radially crossing portions of the fluid passage 8 between one end 2c of the magnet device and portion 2a of the tubular part surrounding the one end 2c of the magnet device, respective surfaces of the tubular portions and the ribs which come into contact with the fluid to be measured being electrically insulated, whereby the magnetic reluctance of the magnetic circuit of the magnet device can be reduced and the sensitivity of the electro magnetic flow meter can be improved.
