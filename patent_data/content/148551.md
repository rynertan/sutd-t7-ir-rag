# METHOD FOR MEASURING MEMBRANE FUSION

## Abstract
A simple and accurate method of measuring membrane fusions which has application in drug administration com prises fusing liposomes containing porins with cation load ed liposomes lacking porins, mixing the reaction mixture obtained with an ionophore and with a fluorescent dye that is sensitive to the negative potential of the liposomes lack ing porins induced by the ionophore and measuring the change in fluorescence intensity of the dye which has oc cured as a measure of the extent of membrane fusion.
