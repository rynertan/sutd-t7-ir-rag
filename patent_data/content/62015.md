# Aluminium sulphate composition for water purifying, paper sizing and plant dewatering purposes and a method for producing the composition.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an aluminium sulphate com position for water purifying, paper sizing and plant dewatering purposes, the composition comprising an aqueous solution of aluminum sulphate containing polynuc lear complexes of the kind Al The invention also relates to a method for producing the composition, in which method a carbonate or hydrogen carbonate of alkali metal and an aluminium sulphate is brought into aqueous solution and the amount of carbonate or hydrogen carbonate is so selected in relation to the amount of aluminium sulphate that a given highest mole ratio OH Al is obtained in the aqueous solution at the desired predetermined total aluminium content of the solution.
