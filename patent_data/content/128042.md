# A PROCESS FOR INDENTIFYING OR ISOLATING A DNA SEQUENCE, AND A DNA HYBRIDIZATION PROBE THEREFOR

## Abstract
A process for isolating a desired DNA sequence from a gene bank using a synthetic DNA hybridization probe of at least about 30 nucleotide base pairs. The probe is synthesized without regard for the degeneracy of the genetic code as it has been discovered that sufficiently long probe will hybridize under controlled conditions to the desired DNA even if not completely homologous with its complementary DNA with sufficient specificity to permit identification and isolation of the desired DNA.
