## Abstract
Combinations of an active compound selected from the class outstanding of hydantoin and thiohydantoin derivatives and their salts together with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Such combinations have pharmacological effects related to those of the active compound alone but these effects other than vasodilatory effects are potentiated by the phos phodiesterase inhibitor whilst the vasodilatory effect is not so potentiated. The combination may be used in medicine either along or in a formulation, for example in the treatment of thrombosis.

## Description
Pharmaceutical combinations including hydantoin derivates, phar maceutical formulations containing the combinations and methods of making the formulations The present invention relates to the use in medicine of hydantoin and thiobydantoin derivatives or their salts in conjunction wit h a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and to a pharmaceutical formulation containing them. Some compounds selected from hydantoin and thio hydantoin derivatives and their salts blaze been disclosed as having a variety of pharmacologicaj effects including a potent anti aggregatory action on blood platelets. They are therefore oi value as therapeutic agents in the treatment or prevention of thrombo embolic disorders in mammals. Other pharmacological effects exhibited by such hydantoin and thiohydantoin derivatives andd their salts include inhibition of pentagastrininduced gastric acid secretion diuretic properties effects on the uterine smooth muscle effects on the biochemical co operation between platelets and vascular endothelium, which contribute to the repair of damaged vascular endothelium and antagonism of histamineinduced broncho constriction. In addition, many such compounds also exhibit a vasodilatory action on blood vessels. Hydantoin and thlohydantoin derivatives and their salts which exhibit both vasodilatory action and another pharmacological effect as described hereinbefore are referred to hereinafter as the 1active compounds . There are often occasions when it would be desirable to be able to utilize the pharmacological effects referred to above,notably the anti aggregatory effect, while at the same time suppressing or eliminating the vasodilatory effect of the active compounds for example in tlie treatment or prevention of myocardial infarcts and when they are used as an addition in extra corporeal circulation. We have now surprisingly discovered that the pharma colugical effects, but not the vasodilatory effects of the active compounds, are potentiated by chemical compounds which are cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors. This discovery provides a means to dissociate the anta aggregatory and other pharmacological effects from the vasodilatory effect of the active compounds. Accordingly the present invention provides a combination which comprises a an active compound and b a phosphodiesterase inllibitor which is hereinafter referred to as the combination . The combination lowers the threshold level ol tlle pharmacological effect not including vasodilatory effects the minimum amount of active compound required to exhibit a certain pharmacological effect without substantially affecting the vasodilatory threshold level.Thus for example by administering an active compound which exhibits an anti aggregatory effect at a concentration below its vasodilator threshold level, but above the new, lower, anti aggregatory threshold, together with a phospho diesterase inhibitor, anti aggregatory effects can be produced whilst vasodilatory effects are not. Active compounds which exhibit a variety of the pharmacological effects referred to above include 1,5 disubstituted hydantoin and thiohydantoin derivatives optionally further substituted in the 3 and or the 5 position of the hydantoin ring.Examples of such active compounds and their preparation may be found in the following patent specifications Belgian Patent No 855 337, Japanese Nos 63083 79 and 95571 79, Eire patent application No 2370 78, andBelgian Patent No 861 956 and European patent publicatiei No 3 410 European application No 79 30008.4 Active compounds which exhibit interesting vasodilatory and other pharmacological effects include those of formula I EMI4.1 wherein L is 0 or S Z and ,3 are the same or different and each is hydrogen or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms one of ZÚ and Zê is a group CH2 X XÚ Xê wherein X is phenylene, C C , cis or trans CH CH or CH2 CQ2in which each Q is independently selected from ilydrogen and alkyl such as ethyl or the two Q s together form an alkylene radical of four, five or six carbon atoms X is a covalent bond or a straight or branched alkylene chain having 1 to 6 carbon atoms optionally having one of its methylene groups replaced by oxa or thia S provided that at least one carbon atom separates any oxa or thia from a C C , CH CH or COgroup and Xê is selected from 5 tetrazolyl, carboxyl, carboxyamide, hydroxymethylene and alkoxycarbonyl and the other of z1 and z2 is a group Y YÚ Yê Y3 wherein Y is CR2 CH2 in which each R is independently selected from hydrogen and methyl YÚ is carboxyl, methylene, methylene substituted by hydroxyl or methylene substituted by hydroxyl and alkyl Yê is a covalent bond or straight or branched alkylene having 1 to 7 carbon atoms optionally substituted in the carbon adjacent YÚ by one or two groups each of which may he alkyl or a cyclic radical Y3 is hydrogen hydroxy, allcoxy of 1 to 7, preferably 1 to 4, carbon atoms, a cyclic radical, phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy or benzyloxy, wherein each of phenyl, benzyl, phenoxy and benzyloxy may be substituted in the benzene ring by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, halogen, nitro, amino, acylamino, alkenyl, alkoxy, phenyl and alkyl which may itself be substituted by one or more halogeno groups or Y2 and Y3 together form an alkyl group of 1 to 7 carbon atoms having at least one hydrogen replaced by fluoro or Y is a bond, CH2 or CII2.CIS2 and YÚ, Yê and Y3 talcen together form a cycloalkyl or bicycloalkyl group substituted by a hydroxyl group which preferably has three carbon atoms separating it from the hydantoin ring.

In this combination the dipyridamole has produced a potentiation of the anti aggregatory effect of the active compound in aggregation tests on rabbits and in human platelet rich plasma. Another pwticularly preferred combination is one comprising the less polar isomer of 5 6 carboxyhex 2 enyl 1 3 hydroxy 3 cyclohexylpropyl hydantion m.p.97 99 as active compound and dipyridamole or these phylline as phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Tulle combinations arc of value as therapeutic agents for use in conditions where any of the pharmacological effects mentioned hereinbefore are required, other than vasodilation, For example, because of the anti aggregatory action of an active compound, t he combination may be used to treat or prevent throinbo embolic disorders e.g. the formation of throinbi in mammals, including man. For example, the combinations are useful in the treatment and prevention of myocardial infarcts, to treat and prevent thrombosis, to promote potency of vascular grafts following surgery, and to treat complications of arteriosclerosis and conditions such as abherosclerosis, blood clotting defects due to lipidemia, and other clinical conditions in which the underlying aetiology is associated with lipid imbalance or hyperlipidemia. The active compounds, and therefore the combinations containing them, are especially useful as additives to blood, blood products, blood substitutes and other fluids which are used in artificial extra corporeal circulatio and perfusion of an isolated body portion, e.g. a limb or an organ, whether attached to the original body, detached and being preserved or prepared for transplant, or attached to a new body. During these circulations and perfusions, aggregated platelcts tend to block blood vessels and portions of the circulation apparatus. This blocking may be avoided by the presence of the act ive compounds.For this purpose, the combination may be added gradually or in single or multiple portions to the circulating blood, to the blood of the donor animal, to the perfused body portion, detached or attached, to the recipient, or to two or all of these at a total steady dose of from 0.001 to 10 ing per litre of circulating fluid. It is useful to use the combinations in laboratory animals, e.g. cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, and rates for these purpcses to develop new methods and techniques for organ or limb transplant. An active compound, such as 5 6 carboxy hexyl 3 hydroxyocty hydantoin, 5 6 carboxyhexyl 3 methyl1 3 oxo octyl hydantoin, 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3 ovo octyl hydantoin or 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 4 phenoxybutyl hydantoin, which inhibits pentagastrin induced gastric acid secretion and reduces the forn tion of aspirininduced gastric lesions in rats may be useful in a combination in reducing excessive gastric acid secret ion, reducing and avoiding gastro intestinal ulcer formation and accelerating the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract whether such ulcers arise spont aneously or as a component of polygland alar adenoma syndromes. Intravenous infusions of certain combinations, typically those wherein 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3 hydroxy octyl hydantobi is present, may have a potential utility as diuretic agents, te uses of which include the treatment of oedema, for example oedema associated with heart failure, livcr failure or kidney failure in man or other ammals. A further use for combinations containing an active compound which has an effect on the utcrine smooth muscle is as anti fertility agents, in particular as abort ifacients for example, in controlling conception. A combination comprising an active compound which antagonises llistamine induced broncho constriction, such as 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 3 hydroxy 4,4 dimethyloctyl hydantoin, and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor may be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of bronchial asthma and bronchitis by alleviating the broncho constriction associated with this condition. The combinationms of the present invention may also be used in the treatment of proliferative skin diseases, suel as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, non specific dermatitis, primary irritant contant dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, lamellar ichthyosis, epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, pre malignant sun induced keratosis, non malignant keratosis, acne and seborrheic dermatitis in humans and atopic dermatitis and mange in domestic animals. iThe amount of active compound present in a combination required for therapeutic effect will vary iiot only with the particular compound and the route of administration butalso with the particular phoshodiesterase inhibitor used and zits amount, i.e. with the degree of potentiation that occurs. The amount of active compound, will, however, be below that required to produce a given therapeutic effect in tlle absence of the potentiator and thus also below the level which would produce a significant vasodilatory effect. Tie amount of an active compound required in the absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor i.o achieve the desired pharmacological effect will of course depend on a number of factors for example, the active compound chosen, the use for which it is intended, the mode of administration, and the recipient. In general, a daily dose lies in the range of from 1 g to 20 mg per kilogram bodyweight.Preferably the daily dose is 10 g to 2 ing, especially 100 rig to 0.2 mg 200 ng , per kilogram body weight. For example, an intravenous dose may lie in the range of from 5 g to 1 mg kg, preferably 50 g to 100 g kg which nay conveniently be administered as an infusion of from 0.01 to 50 g preferably 0.1 to 5 g, especially 0.5 to 1.5 g per kilogram per minute. Infusion fluide suitable for this purpose may contain from 0.001 to 100 g ml, for example from 0.01 to 10 J7g per millilitre.Unit doses may contain from 10 g to 100 mg of an active compound depending on how the compound is to be administered for example ainpoules for injection may contain fro 0.01 to 1 mg, preferably 0.05 0.15 mg, for example 0.1 mg and orally administrable unit dose formulations such as tablets or capsules may contain from 0.1 to 50, preferably 2 to 20, ing, especially 5 t o 15 mg, for example 10 mg. More specifically, wllen an active compound is used in the absence of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to inhibit platelet aggregation it is generally desirable to achieve a concentration in the appropriate liquid, whether it be the blood of a patient or a perfusion fluid, of about 1 pg to 10 mg per litre, preferably from 10 jig to 1 mg per litre, especially 0.05 to 0.15 mg per litre, for example 0.1 ing per litre. However, in the present invention where a phospho dicsterase inhibitor is used a suitable dose of active compound will in general be about half or, say, up to about 75 of the dose required in the absence of phosphodiesterase inhibitor, e.g. 0.05 to 25, e.g. 2.5 to 7.5 ing e.g. 5 mg, for tablets. In general the active compound and phosphodiesterase inhibitor are administered in a weight ratio of 1 part of active compound to from 1 to 200, preferably from 10 to 150, especially 40 to 100, e.g. 60, parts of phosphodiesterase inhibitor. While it is possible for a3l active compound and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to be administered as raw chemicals, it is preferable to present them as one or more pharmaceutical formulations. A unit dose of a formulation of a combination flay contain from 0.05 to 25 mg, preferably 1 to 10 ing, especially 2.5 to 7.5 mg e.g. 5 mg of the active compound, and from 100 to 400 ing, e.g. from 250 to 350 mg, e.g.300 mg of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Accordingly a unit dose formulation may contain for example, 300 mg of phosphodiesterase inhibitor and 5 mg of an active colnpound. The abovementionod doses of the active compounds refer to the acids, amides, esters, alcohols and tetrazoles etc of the active compounds where a salt is used, the dose should be taken as referring to the corresponding anion. A formulation of the present invention both for veierinary and for human medical use, comprises a combination together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredient s . . ben the active compound and phosphodiesterase inhibitor are to be administerd separately, the formulation to be used comprises the active compound together with one or more acceptable carriers therefor and optionally caller therapeutic ingredient s the phosphodiesterase inhibitor formulatinn may comprise any formulation in which such a compound is normally presented. The carrier must be acceptable1 in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient therefor. Formulations include those suitable for oral e.g.buccal, rectal, vaginal or parenteral including sub cutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection or infusion or intrapulmonary administration, although the most suitable route in a given case will depend u ,on the active compound. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by methods knows in the art of pharmacy. All such methods include the step of bringing into association the combination with the carrier which constitutes oe or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into associati.on, e.g.by admi, ing, the combination with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the formulation into the desired presentation. Formulations according to the invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as a capsule, cachet, lozenge or tablet each containing a predetermined amount of the combination as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non aqueous liquid or as an oil inwater emulsion ur a water in oil liquid emulsion. A formulation according to the invention for parenteral administration may be presented in an ampoule for receiving a defined quantity of liquid for making a solution for infusion. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory illgredients. Compresed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the combination in a free flowing forlll, such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubrificant, pharmaceutically inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a combination together with a suitable carrier moistened with a pharmaceutically inert liquid diluent. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a conventional carrier, such as cocoa butter. Formulation suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as a pessary, cream, paste or spray form ulation containing, in addition to the combination, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Formulation suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation the combination which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. As the active compound can be absorbed through the skin into tlie blood of the recipient, it may be ndrniuictcrcd topically in a topical formulation. The phesphodiesterase inhibitor may be administered by another route, unless, of course, it can be absorbed through the skin into the blood when i i which case it can administered topically.

Aggregation w as induced in rabbit platelet rich plasma PRP by addition of arachidonic acid, and monitored in aBorn type aggregometer. A dose of dipyridamole was selected which caused no inhibition of aggregation when added to the PRP 2 minutes prior to the addition of arachidonic acid. The active compound when added to thePRP 1 minute prior to tiie addition of arachidoni acid caused p dose related inhibition of aggregation. The percentage inhibition caused by the active compound was compared in the presence and absence of the selected dose of dipyridainole. The results are set out in Table A.
