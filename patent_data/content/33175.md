# Solar collector comprising a heat exchanger.

## Abstract
Solar collector comprising a closed housing of mainly rectangular cross section, a collector thermally connected to the housing for converting solar rays into heat, a working fluid which, during operation, is partly liquid and partly gaseous, an evaporation space 3 within the housing, a condensation space 4 within the housing, an internal connection between said spaces, and a heat exchanger 5 . An intensive thermal contact between the heat exchanger s and the working fluid is obtained by providing the condensation space 4 with a wall profiled inwardly of the housing and forming a space substantially shut off from the surrounding atmosphere, said space being positioned within the outer boundary of the housing but outside the internal portion thereof, and by disposing the heat exchanger s within said space and in thermal contact with said wall.
