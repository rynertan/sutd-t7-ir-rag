# Method of and apparatus for processing squid.

## Abstract
A squid processing method and apparatus includes an endless chain conveyor 21, 22 . The conveyor 21, 22 has elongated carriers 31 , each for receiving a squid. The carriers 31 hold the squid in such an orientated position that during further advancement of the conveyor 21, 22 the squid is brought into engagement with two rotating cutters 37, 38 that divide the squid into three parts, namely the mantle, the eye and the tentacles. After the eye and ten tacles have been discharged, the mantle is transferred onto a rotatable peg 45 . As the peg 45 rotates, jets of water strip the skin from the mantle and flush loosened internal parts from inside the mantle before the mantle is forced from the peg 45 into a suitable receptacle.
