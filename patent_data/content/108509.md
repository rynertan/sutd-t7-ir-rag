# STENCIL, STENCIL MATERIAL SET AND STENCIL DUPLICATOR SET CONTAINING THE SAME

## Abstract
This invention provides a stencil from which a pattern wise perforated stencil can be easily made by handwriting, a stencil material set with which a patternwise perforated stencil can be made, and a stencil duplicator set which, in combination with the stencil, performs simple, clear printing. The stencil is made up of a porous support 2 and a masking film formed thereon, said masking film being made of a water insoluble polymer having tertiary amino groups. The stencil material set contains the stencil 2 and a patternwise perforated stencil making solution which forms a water soluble product upon reaction with said polymer. Stencil printing is performed using the patternwise perforated stencil, a stencil duplicator 1 and printing ink 4 .
