# Detergent composition containing mixture of anionic sulfate and sulfonate surfactants.

## Abstract
Detergent compositions containing a surfactant system which consists essentially of a mixture of C₁₃ linear alkyl benzene sulfonate and the sulfate reaction product of a C₁₄ ₁₅ alcohol and about 1 mole of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. The pH of the compositions in wash is preferably from about 9.2 to about 10. Such compositions provides superior cleaning of body soil in cool water and when the hardness present is in excess of the capacity of detergent builders present.
