# Speech signal processing system.

## Abstract
A speech signal processing in which the correlation is removed from the sample values of a speech waveform supplied to an inverse filter for obtaining sample values of a prediction residual waveform, phase equalizing filter coefficients are determined to have phase characteristic inverse to that of the prediction residual waveform at each pitch position of the speech waveform, the phase equalizing filter coefficients are set as filter coefficients of the phase equalizing filter, the speech waveform or the prediction residual waveform is passed through the phase equalizing filter, thereby zero phasing the prediction residual waveform or the prediction residual waveform component in the speech waveform and concentrating energy around the pitch position.
