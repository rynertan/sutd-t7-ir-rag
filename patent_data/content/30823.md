# Relative system response elevator call assignments.

## Abstract
An elevator control system employs a microprocessor based group controller 17 which communicates with the cars 3, 4 of the elevator system to determine conditions of the cars and responds to hall calls 18, 19, 20 registered at a plur ality of landings in the building serviced by the cars under control of the group controller, to provide assignments of calls to cars based on the summation for each car, with respect to each call, of a plurality of weighted system response factors some of which are indicative of conditions of the car irrespective of the call to be assigned, and some indicative of conditions of the car relative to the call to be assigned. Such factors include preferring cars which are running, which require motion to provide service already assigned to the car, which do not have lobby calls, which are not positioned at the lobby, which are not full, even though the car may have a car call at the floor of the hall call under consideration, which do not have excessive car calls in them and so forth.
