# Atomized water dispersing apparatus.

## Abstract
Atomized water dispersing apparatus which is comprised of a general cylindrical casing 1 provided at its rear part with the inlet for the air which is sucked in by a centrifugal impeller 4 which is driven by a motor 5 and which is integral with a concentric annular deflector 6 having a greater diameter than the impeller blades and having a width substantially corresponding to that of said blades. Preferably the deflector is connected to the impeller by a collar 6b which is likewise concentric and completes the deflector, thus forming a concentric crown 16 for axially forced air flow when the impeller and the cylindrical deflector are jointly rotating, said air being directed through an annular passage 7 defined between the outer casing and that of the motor. Also preferably, the apparatus has, in continuation of the annular passage 7, a spout ending with a collar 20 wherein there is located a toric annular duct 21 which received water under pressure and is provided with series of atomizers 22 which provide an outlet for the water for it to be dispersed when crossing with the air jets leaving through the collar of the spout.
