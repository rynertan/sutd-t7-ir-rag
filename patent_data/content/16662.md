# Electrically conductive polymeric compositions.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the injection moldable and extrusion type electrically conductive polymeric blend com positions preferably having a viscosity at 200 C at 0.73 sec ยน of less than about 8 x 10โต poises. The compositions used for elastomeric articles include a neutralised sulphonated polymer graphite fibre at a concentration of 1 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of neutralised sulphonated polymer and a preferential plasticiser at less than 60 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the neutralised sulphonated polymer. The compositions may also optionally include fillers, oils and other additives. These blend composi tions can be readily processed due to their superior rheolo gical properties on conventional plastic fabrication equip ment, especially on low and high pressure injection molding or extrusion equipment into electrically conductive articles having excellent physical and electrical properties.
