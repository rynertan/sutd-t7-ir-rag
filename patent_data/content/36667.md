# TRANSAXLE FOR A VEHICLE DRIVELINE

## Abstract
An automatic transaxle for use in an automotive vehicle driveline including a compound planetary gearset 16 , a hydrokinetic unit 12 and a torque splitter gear unit 14 that cooperate to define torque delivery paths from the vehicle engine to a driven gear 64 the driven gear 64 being located between the hydrokinetic unit 12 and the compound planetary gearing 16 and the torque splitter gear unit 14 being located within the housing for the hydrokinetic unit 12 and clutch and brake means for establishing and disestablishing each of the forward driving ratios and the reverse drive ratio, the clutch and brake means being arranged in a compact fashion within the housing 74 for the compound plane tary gearing 16 to provide a minimum axial length of the assembly the driven gear 64 being connected drivably to the vehicle traction wheels through a diffe rential gearing mechanism 75 the hydrokinetic unit 12 , the gearing 16 and the differential mechanism being enclosed in a common cast housing 70 .
