# Device for threading knit articles onto the pin holder ring of a linking machine.

## Abstract
For orderly threading knit articles, preferably in the form of knit hems 9 , onto the pin holder ring 3 of a linking machine, a device 1 is disclosed which comprises, in a supporting frame associated with the linking machine, a comb like element 6 having a plurality of coplanar dents 7 arranged facing the ring pins 8 , and arranged tangentially to the pin holder ring 3 and movably associated with the supporting frame. The comb like element 6 may be con nected kinematically to the pin holder ring 3 to achieve a translation speed which is substantially equal to the peripheral rotation speed of the pin holder ring 3 during a knitwork threading stroke. Associated with the supporting frame is a transfer assembly 10 cooperating with the dents 7 of the comb like element 6 , and an element 14 is provided for picking up one of the knit articles 9 threaded onto the comb like element 6 to set it into an advanced position on the dents 7 .
