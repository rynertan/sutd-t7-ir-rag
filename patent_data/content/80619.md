# Method for determining photomask alignment.

## Abstract
This describes a method for electrically evaluating the overlay error of a photolithographic tool. In this process a reusable substrate 10 bearing a fixed reference mark 15 has a photolithographic tool defined metal liftoff pattern 17 formed thereon to provide a pair of conductive lines 20a, 20b by measuring the relative resistance of the lines with respect to one another the alignment of the tool defined pattern with regard to the reference mark 15 may be determined and thus the overlay error of the tool estab lished.
