# Apparatus for measuring auditory reaction time.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for measuring an athlete s audi tory reaction time, and for training an athlete to reduce his auditory reaction time in response to an auditory stimulus used to initiate an athletic event. The apparatus automatical ly provides a sequence of variable time delays followed by auditory stimuli which simulates the sequence and auditory quality of the preparatory commands used to initiate an athletic event. The apparatus further provides means for measuring and indicating the athlete s auditory reaction time in response to the auditory stimulus which represents the Go signal of the athletic event.
