# A process for producing frozen potato strips from strips of raw potatoes.

## Abstract
A process for producing frozen potato strips from raw potato strips which process comprises circulating humid hot air over the surfaces of the raw potato strips in unblanched condition until the strips are partially gelatinized and partially dehydrated substantially throughout and their weight is reduced to 85 to 90 of their raw weight, circulating substantially dry hot air over the surfaces of the strips until the strips are further partially dehydrated and their weight is 75 to 80 of their raw weight, and thereafter freezing the strips for storage without the strips having been blanched. Optionally, the strips may be partially fried after being dehydrated and prior to being frozen. The potato strips are prepared quickly and effectively for frozen storage, while conserving energy and maintaining the texture, flavour and odor of the finally fried potato strips comparable to potato strips which have been deep fat fried without having been frozen.

## Description
A process for producing frozen potato strips from strips of raw potatoes The present invention relates to a process for producing frozen potato strips from strips of raw potatoes. For producing deep fat fried potatoes for quickservice, it is important that a stock of potato strips be available to meet varying demands. Customers prefer to have deep fat fried potato strips, known in the UnitedStates as French fried potatoes or simply French fries , that have the texture, flavor and odor of fresh deep fat fried potatoes, but they do not want to wait to have such potatoes cooked. Consequently, it is desirable to be able to subject the potato strips to a very brief final heating or finish cooking while producing an attractive and palatable product. The demand for deep fat fried potato strips is not particularly seasonal, yet the growing of the potatoes from which they are made is seasonal. Consequently, it is necessary to utilize a practical method of preserving deep fat fryable potato strips, for a considerable period of time, up to a year, and it is customary to accomplish such preservation of potato strips by freezing. A stock of frozen potato strips thus can be accumulated immediately following the potato growing season and the stock can be distributed as needed to meet the substantially constant demand for deep fat fryable potato strips throughout the following year. Frozen potato strips have been used for making quick service deep fat fried potatoes, but such potatoes have generally not been of the best quality, having one or more of the characteristics of sogginess, pale color, lack of crispness, poor flavor, a leathery shell and an interior that is undercooked or pasty instead of being mealy throughout. In some instances, prior to being frozen, potato strips have been blanched, as in Strong UnitedStates patent 3,397,993 issued August 20, 1968, and Wilder United States patent 3,649,305 issued March 14, 1972, or partially cooked in water, or partially deep fat fried, or partially dehydrated, or subjected to some combination of such process steps. Such deep fat fried potato strips often have not been of comparable quality to those of the invention as claimed. The Katucki et al. United States patent 3,359,123 issued December 19, 1967, proposes to use heated air for partially cooking whole unpeeled potatoes prior to being frozen, but the potatoes are dehydrated after being frozen rather than prior to being frozen as in the claimed process. The potato strips of the Barskey et al. UnitedStates patent 2,565,942 issued August 28, 1951, are partially dried or cooked in water prior to being frozen. The Kaehler United States patent 3,244,538 issued April 5, 1966, proposes to subject potato strips to a preliminary drying step using dry heat or superheated steam prior to the potatoes being frozen, but any cooking effect which occurs extends only to the exterior of the potato, leaving the interior substantially uncooked or raw. The invention as claimed provides a process for producing frozen potato strips which may be subjected to a very brief final heating or finish cooking and retain the texture, flavor and odor of freshly deep fat fried raw potatoes. This is accomplished by circulating humid hot air over the surfaces of potato strips in unblanched substantially raw condition and thereby partially gelatinizing and partially dehydrating the strips close to their centers, circulating substantially dry hot air over the surfaces of the strips and thereby further partially dehydrating the strips and thereafter freezing the strips for storage without the strips having been blanched. The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that potato strips are prepared quickly and effectively for frozen storage while maintaining a high quality of such strips. Moreoever such frozen potato strips can be finally deep fat fried quickly for consumption. Further the process for preparing the frozen potato strips conserves energy by minimizing heat required to cook and or dry such strips. Such strips when finish fried, even without being thawed first, have an appearance, texture, flavor and odor comparable to potato strips which have been deep fat fried without having been frozen. One way of carrying out the invention is described below in detail. Potatoes of a variety known to be suitable for deep fat frying are sorted, peeled and trimmed in accordance with conventional practice. Then the potatoes are cut into strips of a size customarily used for deep fat frying, such as of a width and thickness 1 4 inch 6.35 mm to 1 2 inch 12.7 mm and several inches more than 10 cm in length. After such strips are cut, they can be washed to remove surface starch. The potato strips thus prepared can be treated by dipping or briefly soaking them in an antioxidant solution, or spraying them with such a solution, to inhibit discoloration by oxidation on exposure to air for a prolonged period. The solution may be a 1 2 to 12 by weight aqueous solution of sodium pyrophosphate Na2H2P207 , sodium bisulfite NaHSO3 , citric acid or other known discoloration inhibitor. The treating solution also may include reducing sugar, if desired, to facilitate browning of the potato strips when being finally deep fat fried ready for consumption. The treating solution may be heated to a temperature of 1300 F. to 1800 F. 560 C. to 820 C. and the potatoes may be subjected to the action of such a solution for a brief period within the range of 10 seconds to 25 seconds. The potato strips then are subjected to heat at a temperature, for a time and under conditions which will partially cook and partially dehydrate the potato strips, such that the metabolic functions are deactivated, as evidenced by gelatinization of the starch. The affected potato material progresses toward a finely granular condi tion in which the granules are easily separated. The potato strips are placed in an enclosure and hot air is circulated over their surfaces. The cooking and dehydrating operations can be performed as a batch process or as a continuous process, and the potato strips can be stationary or moved on a belt through a heated chamber. The processing apparatus can be designated as a heating enclosure. The heating of the potato strips can be effected entirely by high velocity currents of air heated by a heat exchanger, or heating effected by the air can be supplemented by auxiliary heat sources such as infrared or microwave heaters. The degree and penetration of cooking will depend on the condition and variety of potato, the cross sectional size and shape of the strips, the type or types of heat source or sources, the temperature, humidity and velocity of the heating air and the length of time that the strips are subjected to heating. The first stage of heating is to remove surface moisture from the potato strips. The temperature of the initial air blown onto the strips may be within the range of 1900 F. to 2800 F. 880 C. to 1380 C. , and preferably within the range of 2500 F. to 2800 F. 1220 C. to 1380C. . The moisture content of the air should be less than 158 by weight so that the air currents will scavenge moisture readily from the surfaces of the potato strips in a period of 1 to 3 minutes. During such treatment, no appreciable moisture will be evaporated from the interiors of the potato strips. During a second stage of heating, the potato strips are subjected to currents of hot humid air in the temperature range of 2000 F. to 2500 F. 940 C. to 1220C. , preferably within the range of 2300 F. to 2500 F. 1100 C. to 1220 C. , for a period of time sufficient to partially cook or gelatinize the strips and partially dehydrate them, in about three minutes to six minutes.The strips will be cooked to at least some degree close to the center but the outer portions of the strips will be cooked to a greater extent. Moisture evaporated from the potato strips tends to increase the humidity of the air as it is circulated. It is preferred that the moisture content of the air be within the range of 15 to 40 by weight. The recirculating air humidity is controlled so that the potato strips will be dehydrated to the desired extent while simultaneously being partially cooked. Such humid air can penetrate more effectively into the potato strips to cook them. The partial cooking modifies the cell structure of the potato so that the metabolic functions are deactivated and the starch is gelatinized, resulting in a finely granular condition in which the granules are soft but not mushy and are easily separated.Such a texture is designated as mealy . The air moisture content can be regulated by controlling the amount of dry air admitted to the heating chamber and the amount of moist air discharged from the chamber. During the cooking evaporating treatment, the moisture content of the potato strips will be reduced so that the partially cooked and partially dehydrated strips will have a weight of 85 to 90 of their original weight. During a third stage of heating the potato strips are subjected to heat which will dehydrate them to a weight of 75 to 80 of their original weight. Such heating may be effected by comparatively dry hot air, such as having a moisture content less than 10 by weight, which may or may not be supplemented by infrared or microwave heating. During such dehydration step, much of the heating air is exhausted or dried to maintain the low moisture content specified. Such dehydrating operation may be accomplished in two to four minutes. More moisture will be removed from the outer portions of the potato strips than from the inner portions. The surfaces of the potato strips will be dry to the touch, and the edges and corners of the potato strips may be almost totally dehydrated.Such dehydration procedure will result in a shell or crust on final deep fat frying which will be crisp but tender and not leathery. The potato strips that are subjected to the cooking dehydrating operation discussed above have not previously been blanched with steam, have not previously been soaked in water and have not previously been cooked in water. The antioxidant treatment by spraying or dipping is of sufficiently short duration so that the potato strips do not absorb any substantial amount of moisture during such initial treatment. Consequently, it is not necessary for the heated air to remove from the potato strips any substantial amount of artificial moisture which they have acquired, but, on the contrary, during the cooking dehydrating operation, it is almost entirely the natural moisture of the potato strips that is evaporated.Consequently, the drying cooking dehydrating operation is performed more rapidly, and by supplying less heat energy, than would be required if the potato strips had picked up any substantial amount of artificial moisture prior to or during the cooking operation. Following the drying cooking dehydrating operation described above, the partially cooked and partially dehydrated potato strips can be allowed to cool briefly and then can be par fried quickly in cooking oil, such as for a period of 1 3 of a minute to 2 minutes, depending on the temperature of the cooking oil and the size of the potato strips and the desired solids contents of the strips. Preferably the cooking oil is within the temperature range of 3250 F. to 3900 F. 1630 C. to 1990 C. .This preliminary deep fat frying operation removes additional moisture from the potato strips, the amount removed depending on the size of the strips, the temperature of the cooking oil and the duration of the preliminary frying step. The potato strips then are frozen in a conventional manner and held in frozen condition until they are ready to be prepared for consumption by being subjected to the final deep fat frying operation. Such final frying operation can be accomplished without first thawing the potato strips and within a period of 1 1 2 minutes to 3 minutes if the cooking oil is at a temperature within the range of 3400 F. to 3800 F. 1710 C. to 1930 C. . The resulting deep fat fried potato strips will have a crisp exterior without being leathery, will have a substantially homogeneous mealy interior and will be of golden brown color. Their flavor and odor will be as pleasant as those of potatoes which are deep fat fried without ever having been frozen.
