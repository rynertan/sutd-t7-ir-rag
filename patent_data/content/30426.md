## Description
Polymer CompositionsThis invention relates to novel polymer compositions and to the use of these compositions for coating and bonding purposes.Many coating and adhesive compositions are currently solventbased and consequently at some stage during the coating or bonding process the solvent must be removed. Unfortunately, readily available solvents which are otherwise suitable for this purpose are often hazardous from the point of view of toxity and or flammability. In attempts to overcome this problem, coating and adhesive compositions have been proposed based upon a liquid ingredient which can be applied to a substrate and then solidified, for example by cross linking or polymerisation. Whilst this type of composition does have the advantage of avoiding the use of a conventional solvent it is often formulated to splidify very quickly in use in order to minimise assembly time and therefore has the disadvantage of only a transient intermediate stage at which the composition is tacky.The present invention is intended to remedy these drawbacks by providing polymer compositions which are novel in themselves and useful as coating and adhesive compositions spreadable at ambient temperature e. g. 20 C . When used as coating or adhesive compositions, the novel compositions render the use of conventional solvents unnecessary and have the added advantage of passing through a finite intermediate stage at which they are tacky, i.e. have grab , and have some cohesive strength. It is even possible to formulate compositions within the scope of the present invention which have a greatly extended tacky stage e.g. of several weeks or more.A tacky, cohesive stage of practical duration is very desirable when bonding a variety of substrates e.g. rubber, wood, leather etc., because it allows positioning and if necessary, repositioning before the adhesive composition completely solidifies. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fluid composition which comprises at least two compatible solidifiable, liquid oligomers as hereinafter defined.According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of coating a substrate by applying a fluid composition which comprises at least two compatible, solidifiable, liquid oligomers as hereinafter defined and causing or allowing said fluid composition to solidify.According to yet another aspect of the present invention a method of making a composite by bonding a first substrate to a second substrate comprises i applying to one or both substrates a fluid composition which comprises at least two compatible, solidifiable, liquid oligomers as hereinafter defined, ii allowing the composition or compositions to attain a coherent, tacky state, iii assembling the substrates with the composition or compositions at the interface and iv solidifying the composition or compositions to bond the assembly.The solidifiable oligomers are those which are substantially chemically inert towards each other and which can solidify by curing substantially independently of each other and at a different rate. Thus one of the oligomers is solidified within the other liquid oligomer lust stage cure resulting in a coherent tacky, thickened composition which reaches its final solid form via curing of the other oligomer 2nd stage cure . By compatible is meant that the oligomers can be intimately mixed and will remain so during curing. Oligomers are discussed by A.A. Berlin in PolymerScience USSR , Vol. 20 page 541 onwards. Published byPergamon Press Limited 1979 and are characterised as follows Examination of the variation in the partial values of a number of physiochemical parameters, symbolised as , with change in the number of units in a chain molecule, n3 reveals three clearly defined main regions 1 where d P dn const, 2 d P dn const and 3 d P dn O The first region consists of low molecular substances ixe. homologues containing in the region of 2 to 3 units where the size of the molecule has not reached that of the statistical segment and the molecular chain is not flexibleThe second region consists of oligomers compounds with degrees of polymerisation of n 2 to 100 i.e. substances whose molecules can include a few statistical segments and are characterised by partial values of parameters that are not averaged with respect to chain length. The third region contains high polymers i.e. compounds of n 103 to 104 and a multiplicity of statistically averaged conformational transi ions. Preferably the amount of each solidifiable oligomer is at least 5 more preferablv from 10 to 80 and usually 20 to 50 parts by weight per 100 parts of the two oligomers.Solidification of one or both oligomers may occur spontaneously or may be caused by, or accelerated by, a change in conditions e.g. by the application of heat, moisture and or radiation.Solidification is by curing and does not rely upon evaporation to any substantial extent. Curing is a common term in the art used to describe a process whereby a material is changed so as to be substantially insoluble. The term curing include cross linking and chain extension whereby a material undergoes a chemical change which is usually either irreversible or reversible with difficulty. Both oligomers consist essentially of a liquid oligomer substantially curable via end group functiorlality. Examples of suitable combinations of compatible, solidifiable oligomers fall into two groups a Oligomers having the same polymeric backbone but different type of end group e.g. two different end group terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymers such as those available under the trade name Hycar from Goodrich Chemicals or two different types of is ocyanate terminated urethane prepolymer eDg. one based upon poly tetrahydrofuran and an isocyanate with one based upon a polyester and an isocyanate in which the isocyanate groups have been reacted with an acrylic monomer such as hydroxyethyl acrylate or an epoxide or silane.b Oligomers having a different polymeric backbone e.g.a tipped butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer with an isocyanateterminated urethane prepolymer. When a tipped liquid butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer is used examples of tipping groups include carboxyl, amine, vinyl, hydroxyl, merdapto and bromine.Preferably at least one of the oligomers will be elastomeric when solidified.The oligomer composition may include at least one ingredient, either liquid or a finely dispersed solid, which will react with one of the liquid oligomers e.g. an epoxy resin based on a diphenol such as 2,2 di 4 hydroxy phenyl propane, an amine, and or an organic isocyanate such as liquid M.D.I. 4,4 diphenyl methane diisocyanate . Such an ingredient may act specifically as a curing agent for one of the liquid oligomers and may be temporarily chemically blocked so that it will not become active until it becomes unstable by the action of e.g. heat, air, moisture, W radiation etc.Alternatively, or in addition, at least one of the liquid oligomers may be chemically blocked so that its chemical activity is retarded e.g. a urethane prepolymer blocked with methyl ethyl ketoxime available as Adiprene BL 16 fromDu Pont. Where more than one curative is included chemical interaction which affects their specific cure function must not occur. Second stage curatives may be applied by methods known in the art to the surface of the coating after the first stage cure has occurred.Other additives which can be included in the oligomer composition may be selected from a tackifier, an antioxidant or other type of stabilisers a reinforcing filler ehgç carbon black2 silane treated silica a metal carbonate or silicate 9 glass or textile fibres , a nonreinforcing filler e.g. talc or titanium oxide , and a colourant e.g. a metal oxides a metal sulphide or an organic pigment . Absorbable plasticisers or reactive liquids may be included as diluents e.g. acrylic monomers or low molecular weight epoxy resins.If desired an oligomer composition according to the present invention may be applied to a surface e.g. a release paper , allowed to or caused to thicken to a tacky state and then removed from the surface to be completely solidified at a later stage. In this way a portable adhesive can be made e.g. the tacky film can be applied to a first substrate and then assembled with a second substrate so that a bonded composite will result upon final cure of the film.Examples of substrates which may be coated or bonded according to the present invention include those of elastomers, plastics, wood, leather, paper, textiles or metals. The method of bonding can be used to bond i portions of a substrate to each other, ii substrates of different compositions or iii substrates of the same composition.The invention is illustrated by way of various oligomer oligomer combinations in the following Examples in which all parts are by weight. EXAMPLE I Parts Urethane prepolymer in which isocyanate groups have been reacted with an acrylic monomer available as Uvithane 783 from Thiokol 30 EXAMPLE I cont d PartsUrethane prepolymer of polytetrahydrofuran and 2,4 toluene diisocyanate available as Adiprene L100 from Du Pont 70Benzophenone 1.0N methylmorpholine 1.0The very viscous Uvithane 783 was thoroughly mixed with the more fluid Adiprene L100 nominal isocyanate content P 4.2, viscosity at 250C p 250 poise by gently worming them and hand stirring them together. The benzophenone 1w initiator was dissolved in the liquid tertiary amine and added to the mixture which was kept in a sealed container.A portion of the freshly prepared formulation was spread onto a flat poly tetrafluoroethylene Teflon coated metal sheet to form a film of approximately 0.5 mm in thickness. The film was placed under a Hanovia health lamp of 250 watt, at approximately 10 cm from the lamp, and subjected to W radiation for 5 minutes.The film became tacky and rubbery and although very weak could be removed from the support sheet and carefully handled. The film was left to stand exposed to air at room temperature for two days in which time it transformed into a reasonably strong, flexible, rubbery material.Further portions of the freshly prepared mixture were spread evenly onto two 1 inch x 1 inch sheets cut from Formica, plywood, and two pieces of flat, buffed cured Neoprene tanklining material and left several minutes to level out.Each coating was then exposed to the W treatment as before.The appropriate pieces were then firmly pressed together using a hand pressure roller and left at ambient temperature for four days. After this time it was found that theNeoprene tank linings had bonded together and that theFormica had adhered to the plywood. EXAMPLE II PartsUvithane 783 Thiokol 30Adiprene L100 du Pont 70 EXAMPLE II coated PartsBenzophenone 1.0N methyl morpholine 1.0Caytur 21 available from Du Pont 14 Diamine salt complex dispersed in plasticizer The formulation was blended as in the previous Example and a portion spread onto a Teflon coated metal plate to give a thin film which was placed under the bench 1w lamp for 5 minutes. A weakly coherent sheet was obtained which had slight surface tackiness and could Just be removed from the plate with care. The metal plate supporting the film was then placed on a surface heated to approximately 150 C. The sheet cured rapidly within a few minutes to give a reasonably strong flexible material.A further portion of the mix was coated evenly onto two 2 inch x 4 inch sheets of buffed cross linked Neoprene tank lining material to give a smooth thin coating. These surfaces were given 3 minutes tW exposure and were then placed in contact together and oonsolidated by means of a hand roller This assembly could be handled without the sheets separating easily, The assembly was then pressed at 1300C for 8 minutes under 1 MN m2 pressure and released while hot. A good bond was obtained with the tank liqing material. EXAMPLE IIIPart A PartsAdiprene L167 available from Du Pont 100 urethane prepolymer of polytetrahydrofuran and 2,4 toluene diisocyanatep viscosity 75 poise at 24 C, nomlnal isocyanate content 5.1 Part BAdiprene BL 16 available from Du Pont 100 urethane prepolymer in which isocyanate group are blocked with methyl ethyl ketoxime, viscosity S approximately 2000 poise at 250C, nominal unblocked isocyanate content 5.3 EXAMPLE III cont d Pats Caytur 21 Du Pont 25The mixture of Parts A and B were spread as a 0. 5 mm thin film onto Teflon coated metal sheet and left to stand at ambient temperature for 2 days to cure by moisture diffusion.After this time the film was coherent, elastic and strong enough to be easily removed from the plate. The film was substantially free of air bubbles and had excellent tack and cohesive strength which remained for many days. After 3 days a portion of the film was placed in an air oven and cured for 2 hours at 1420C. The cured film was tack free, elastic and fairly strong although it had discoloured brown. Gas bubbles occurred in films of thicker sections. Part B of the formulation alone was also cast and cured in the air oven at 1420C for 2 hours. Thin films cured but thicker films did not and developed gas bubbles on the underside. A further portion of the tacky film was left to stand for 1 week after casting, and placed between two pieces of clean, sanded porous plywood strips under light pressure. The film held the pieces together sufficiently to allow handling.This combination was clamped together by means of a screw G clamp and placed in an air oven at 1420C for 1 hours.The wood pieces were firmly bonded together. EXAMPLE IV PartsPart AAdiprene L100 Du Pont 100Caytur 21 25Part BAdiprene BL 16 100DD 1443 a liquid diamine supplied by Bayer 8Parts A and B were thoroughly mixed together and the mixture spread onto a poly tetrafluoroethylene Teflon coated metal plate using a serrated adhesive applicator. The mixture levelled out to form a film of approximately 0.5 mm thicknessThe pot life of the mixture was approximately Oe5 hour. After 4 hours at room temperature the film had become coherent and was very tacky. The film was left overnight and then removed from the Teflon plate and placed onto a poly ethylene terephthalate film Melinex and covered with polythene sheet The film was coherent and although fairly weak was rubbery with a very low modulus and had excellent tack to itself. This state remained for several weeks.A portion of the film was cured in an oven at 14O0C for 1 hours. This treatment transformed it into a toughs tack free film.A portion of the freshly prepared mixture was also spread uniformly onto the clean sanded surfaces of a piece of wood and Formica. The treated surfaces were left to stand for 4 hours and the two tacky surfaces were then pressed together.The assembly, which was capable of holding itself together, was clamped in a G clamp and placed in an air oven at 1400C for 1 hours. The laminate was well bonded after this time EXAMPLE V Ref 29 Adiprene L100 Du Pont urethane prepolymer was reacted with 1.01 equivalents of hydroxy ethyl methacrylate monomer at 400C by stirring the materials together with a trace of stannous octoate catalyst under anhydrous conditions until a homogeneous mixture was obtained. The mixture was then left to stand overnight. The reaction product was a colourless fluid of approximately several hundred poise viscosity at room temperature. Analysis showed that all the isocyanate groups had been fully reacted. This material was used to preparePart B of the adhesive. PartsPart A Adlprene L100 Du Pont 495 Tertiary butyl perbenzoate C.5 Part B PartsAcrylate modified Adiprene L100 47DD 1443 diamine curative Bayer 3Part A was mixed under anhydrous conditions. Both the parts were stored separately in dry9 air tight containers overnight and then equal parts were thoroughly mixed together by handJust prior to use. Each part was stable on storage for at least 3 months. One portion of the adhesive mixture was spread onto the dust free buffed surface of a sheet of a crosslinked Neoprene coated fabric material used in the manufacture of fuel tanks. A hacksaw blade of 32 teeth inchS held in a suitable holderS was used to uniformly apply approximately 100 g m2 of the mixtureS using the blade to work the mixture into the buffed surface.The mixture remained workable for approximately 20 minutes. A thin film of polythene was then placed on the adhesive coating and a smooth hand roller was used to flatten the coating against the polythene and work out the majority of the entrapped air. One inch width strips were cut from this protected combination and left at ambient temperature for a period of between 2 6 hours. The polythene was then cleanly removed from the adhesive layer which was smooth and coherent but very tacky. Pairs of the treated strips were positioned together with the adhesive coated surfaces in contact and a light consolidating pressure was applied using a hand held roller. The strips were sufficiently well held together at this stage to allow careful handling.The adhesive surfaces of certain of the strips were prewarmed to 800C before contact was made. After 4 days standing at ambient temperature it was found that the materials were firmly bonded together. The peel down resistance of the bonded strips was measured at 5 inches min and the results are given in the Table.

At this stage the composites were sufficiently well held to be carefully handled. After a period of 4 days the composites were found to be firmly bonded together Ref 35f A portion of the adhesive was also spread onto a flat sheet of split side leather using a spatula Sufficient quantity was applied to fill the leather surface and provide a smooth adhesive laYer when flat tened agains t polythene film The polythene film was removed from the adhesive surface after 105 hours by which time the adhesive had become conerent and tacky Two layers were pressed together and left for several days to cure at ambient temperature. The leather became well bonded together after this time.

The mixture was usable for approximately 10 minutes and of sufficiently low viscosity to be self levelling when applied as a thin coating.A portion of the adhesive mixture was applied to strips of the buffed cross linked Neoprene tank lining material by means of the serrated applicator and left to stand at room temperature for the periods of time given in the Table below. Two halves of each strip were contacted together and the firmly held laminates placed on a metal plate heated to 800 C. A smooth hand roller was used to consolidate the laminates as they became heated through. There was sufficient slippage of the joint while warm to allow for any adjustment of positioning required. The laminates were cooled and allowed to stand for 4 days before attempting to peel them apart.Interval before laminating mins 15 30 60 120Amount of slippage while warm decreasing Bond to Neoprene after 4 days at good good patchy poor room temperature EXAMPLE VII Ref 45 Adiprene L100 urethane prepolymer was reacted with 1.01 equivalents of gamma mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane at 400C by stirring the materials together with 0.1 of triethylene diamine catalyst Dabco2 Houdry Process Corporation under anhydrous conditions until a homogeneous mixture was obtained. Analysis of the mixture after an overnight stand showed that full reaction of the isocyanate group had occurred by this time. The following parts were prepared using this material. PartsPart AAdiprene L100 Du Pont 43Part BSilane modified Adiprene L100 50DD 1443 diamine curative 3Equal amounts of the two parts were thoroughly mixed together to give an adhesive system which remained spreadable for about 30 minutes. A portion of this was evenly spread onto a smooth, flat sanded surface of two strips of softwood using the serrated hacksaw blade applicator. Polythene film was rolled onto this and the assemblies left to stand at ambient temperature. A further portion of the adhesive mixture was used to coat two glass microscope slides in the same manner. After 2 hours the polythene was removed from the materials to expose the adhesive which had formed a coherent and tacky coating. The two treated wood and the two treated glass surfaces were lightly pressed together and left to stand for 6 days.Both the wood and glass laminates had become firmly bonded after this time. EXAMPLE VIII Ref 53C The following adhesive system was prepared from the epoxymodified Adiprene L100 described in Example Ref. 44C.

Part B had a stable pot life of only a few days. Equal amounts of the freshly prepared adhesive parts were well mixed together and evenly spread onto buffed Neoprene tank fabric by means of the serrated applicator and covered with polythene sheet. The mixture remained spreadable for about 15 minutes. After 1 hour at ambient temperature the polythene film was cleanly removed from the adhesive which had formed a coherent but tacky state by this time.When left protected by the polythene this tacky state remained useable for at least one day. Two halves of the standard Neoprene fabric were contacted together one hour after spreading and pressed at 1300C for 10 minutes using a light moulding pressure. The laminate was removed hot and when cool was found to be firmly bonded together. A sheet of the adhesive was also left to stand for 1 hour and then cured at 130 C for 10 minutes. A fairly strong flexible material was obtained. EXAMPLE IX Ref 58B The adhesive was prepared by thoroughly stirring the following ingredients together in the following order PartsAdiprene L100 Du Pont 250Epicote 815 0 100 Bisphenol A PrereaCted together at 95 C 24 Hycar CTBN 1300 x 13 a carboxyl terminated 124 liquid butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer from B.F. GoodrichDMP 30, Tri dimethyl amino methyl phenol 7.4 Rohm Haas DD 1443, aromatic diamine curative 10The freshly prepared adhesive was spread onto the buffed surface of the Neoprene coated fabric by means of the serrated applicator. The remainder was cast between two layers of polythene to give a film of approximately 1 mm.The mixture was spreadable for about 15 minutes. After 1 hour at ambient temperature the polythene was cleanly removed from the adhesive which had become coherent and very tacky. The coated Neoprene was cut into two and the two treated surfaces placed together. This was left for 1 hour and then moulded at low pressure at 1300C for 10 minutes and released hot.When coop the laminate was found to be firmly bonded together. The cast film remained tacky for at least 3 days.When cured at 130 C for 10 minutes the film converted to a non tacky strong rubber like material. EXAMPLE X Ref 33 The acrylate modified Adiprene L100, prepared as described in the previous Examples, was used to prepare the following one can mixtures which were mixed in air and then stored under dry conditions in the absence of light. The benzophenone was pre dissolved in the tertiary amine before addition to the mix. The mixtures b and c were stable on storage for at least 2 months.A portion of each of the viscous liquid mixtures given in the Table below was evenly spread onto the surface of 2 x 3 inch strips of clean, sanded, planned softwood, using the serrated applicator. Each coating was covered with transparent plastic cover film and a smooth hand roller was used to flatten the adhesive and work out the majority of entrapped air. The treated surfaces were then exposed to 1w radiation for 2 minutes by placing them under a 250 wattHanovia health lamp at approximately 10 cm from the lamp.The cover film was then removed from each surface when cool.At this stage the control mix a was still a fluid liquid and the polythene could not be removed without disrupting the liquid coating. This state remained the same even after a further 8 minutes irradiation . The other systems however, were found to have gelled after 2 minutes exposure so that the cover film could be removed to leave smooth very tacky surfaces. Two of the wood strips both coated with each mix were lightly pressed together. The grab between the surfaces and the ability of the two strips to be moved sideways to the joint were noted.All the joints were then left in a horizontal position free from stress to cure at ambient temperature. All the adhesives finally cured to tough elastic materials and the joints became firmly bonded.

This joint showed good grab and did not slip in position as much as the first combination.Two inch square strips of the buffed Neoprene tank linking fabric used in the previous examples were treated as above with mixtures b and c . The coated surfaces were applied together after the W treatment and removal of the polythene, using a smooth hand roller to apply pressure. These combinations were then left undisturbed at ambient temperature for one week. The strips were found to be strongly bonded together after this time, with adhesion failure causing tearing of the rubber surface. The laminate of mix b was more uniformly bonded than that of mix c where the uniformity of adhesion was somewhat patchy. EXAMPLE XI Ref 44a The following ingredients were well mixed together using the modified Adiprene L100 materials described previously. PartsAcrylate modified Adiprene L100 30Benzoin n butyl ether 3Epoxy modified Adiprene L100 70Triethylene tetramine 3,5The freshly prepared mix was evenly spread onto a sheet of buffed Neoprene tank linking fabric by means of the hacksaw blade applicator used in Example VII. The mixture had a workable life of 3 hours. A layer of the transparent polythene film was applied and a hand roller used to flatten the adhesive and remove any entrapped air. The assembly was given the 2 minute 1w exposure under the 1w lamp as previously described. The polythene film was then cleanly removed to expose a smooth coherent and tacky adhesive surface. Two of these surfaces were then placed together using a hand roller to apply light pressure.After standing overnight at ambient temperature the adhesive was found to have cured and firmly bonded the material together. EXAMPLE XII Ref 31 The acrylate modified Adiprene L100 prepared as described in the last Example was used to prepare the following mixture which was a fairly viscous fluid stable for at least several months when prepared and stored away from light under dry condi tions Parts Acrylate modified Adiprene L100 30Adiprene L100 Du Pont 70Benzoin n butyl ether 3.0Caytur 21, a diamine salt complex 13.0 dispersed in plasticizer Du Pont A portion of the mixture was spread onto the dust free buffed or sanded surfaces of a two 1 inch strips of a sheet ofNeoprene coated fabric material used in the manufacture of fuel tanks, b a 2 x 4 inch strip of planed softwood, c the back surface of a 2 z 4 inch strip of Formica.A hacksaw blade of 32 teeth inch held in a suitable holder was used to uiformly apply approximately 100 g mê of the mixture on to the surfaces. The blade was used to work the mixture into the surface of the buffed rubber sample. A film of 0.1 mm transparent polythene was placed on each coating and a smooth hand roller was used to flatten the adhesive between the polythene and work out the majority of the entrapped air.The protected coatings were exposed to UV irradiation either by placing them 10 cm below a Hanovia health lamp of 250 watts for 2 Minutes tes or by leaving them in direct winter sunlight for at least 0.5 hour. This UV irradiation period caused the adhesive to gel so that the polythene coating could be cleanly and easily removed. The adhesive at this stage was coherent but tacky with a smooth surface. The appropriate adhesive coated surfaces were contacted together using a hand roller to consolidate the bod. A Morphy Richards steam iron was set to the dry steam position and used to hand press the laminates together for 2 minutes. The surface temperature of the iron was approximately 1400C. The iron was then removed and the laminates cooled.The Neoprenecoated fabric was found to be well bonded together over most of its area so that separation caused tearing of the rubber surface. The Formica was firmly bonded to the wood.To illustrate the effect of W light on the adhesive formulation, a further strip of wood was coated as before and half the surface was covered with transparent polythene, and half with black pigmented polythene. The strip was left in direct sunlight for 2 hours. The adhesive under the transparent polythene had gelled by this time and the polythene could be cleanly removed. The adhesive under the black polythene remained fluid and the polythene could not be removed cleanly. After standing indoors for a further 24 hours the states of the adhesive were the same.A sheet of split side leather was coated on one side with a portion of the adhesive. Sufficient quantity was applied to fill the leather surface and give an air free layer beneath a transparent Melinex film which was rolled onto the adhesive. The assembly was exposed to direct sunlight for 10 minutes and the Melinex was cleanly removed to leave a smooth coherent tacky surface. The sheet was cut into two and the treated surfaces were pressed together for 2 minutes using a hand held iron set to give a surface temperature of approximately 1400C The leather laminate was found to be firmly bonded together when cooled.A further portion of the adhesive was uniformly coated onto a urethane spread coated fabric us ed in the fabrication of flexible containers. The serrated hacksaw blade applicator described previously was used to meter the quantity of adhesive and also to mechanically work the adhesive into the polyurethane surface using a sideways abrading action.A film of transparent Melinex was used to cover this surface and entrapped air was eliminated by means of a smooth handroller. The assembly was exposed to direct sunlight for 10 minutes and the hlelinex was cleanly removed to expose a smooth coherent tacky surface. Two coated surfaces were placed together and the laminate pressed at 1380C for 3 minutes in a low pressure hand press. The laminate was released hot and when cool was found to be well bonded together.Yet another portion of the adhesive was uniformly coated onto a 0.3 mm thick sheet of flexible polyvinyl chloride as in the previous paragraph. The coating covered with Melinex was exposed to the W lamp for a period of 2 minutes.Two of the tacky coated surfaces were positioned together and the combination was placed in a low pressure press at 130 C together with a cured rubber sheet to distribute the pressure.The sample was removed after 10 minutes while still hot and was found to be strongly bonded together when cool. No significant flow of the PVC had occurred under these conditions. EXAMPLE XIII Ref 44C Adiprene All00 urethane prepolymer was reacted with 1.01 equivalents of glycidol at 400C by stirring the materials together with a trace of s tannous octoate catalyst under anhydrous conditions until a homogeneous mixture was obtained.This was left to stand overnight. Analysis of the mixture showed that full reaction of the isocyanate group had occurred by this time This material together with the acrylic modifiedAdiprene L100 described previously were used in the following formulation. PartsPart A Acrylic modified Adiprene L100 50Benzophenone 1.25 Triethylene tetramine 3.0 Part B PartsEpoxy modified Adiprene L100 40Epicote 815 Shell Chemicals diglycidol 11.5 ether of Bisphenol ABisphenol A 222 bis 4 hydroxyphenol 2.75 propane The benzophenone was dissolved in the triethylene tetramine prior to addition with the rest of Part A. The Epicote 815 was prereacted with the Bisphenol A by warming them together at 90 C until dissolved.The two component parts were stable for at least several weeks when stored in the dark.Equal amounts of the freshly prepared adhesive formulation were thoroughly mixed together and spread as an even coating onto the surface of buffed Neoprene tank fabric material using the hacksaw blade applicator and then covered with transparent polythene film as in the previousExamples.The assembly was then immediately exposed as before to theW lamp irradiation for 2 minutes. The polythene was cleanly removed from the adhesive layer which had formed a coherent but tacky coating. Two halves of the sample were immediately positioned together and press cured at 1200C for 10 minutes under light pressure.The laminate was removed hot from the press and allowed to cool at which time it was well bonded together. EXAMPLE XIVThis Example describes a storable heat activated tacky flexible adhesive system.The epoxy modified Adiprene L100 of Example XIII was used to prepare the mixes given in the following Table.Formulations a and c contained no epoxy curative and were for control purposes only. Each freshly prepared mix was uniformly spread onto strips of the buffed Neoprenecoated fabric as used previously, by means of the serrated applicator. Polyethylene film was used to cover each surface The samples were left to stand at ambient temperature until the polythene film could be cleanly removed from the coating. A fast separation rate was found to be preferable. The self tack of each coating was noted at this time and two coated strips were moulded together under low pressure at 15000 for 10 minutes. The remainder of the samples were left for a period of 1 month and the procedure was repeated. The results are given in theTable.

A 0.5 cm thick sheet of coarse reticulated polyurethane foam was pressed against this immediately and the combination was left to stand at room temperature for several days without exposure to light. The adhesive film developed a self tacky state which remained for at least 5 months.After several weeks the film adhesive side of two pieces of the treated foam were contacted rogether and exposed to sunlight for approximately 15 minutes, The foam layers became bonded together, EXAMPLE XVI Ref 95 The Poly BDCN 15 used in the formulation below was a hydroxyltipped poly butadiene acrylonitrile liquid rubber supplied by Arco. This had a viscosity of 500 poise at 25 C with a hydroxyl functionality of 2.6 2.8 and a hydroxyl content of 0.60 m equiv g.
