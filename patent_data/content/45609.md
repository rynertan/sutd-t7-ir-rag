# Electro chemical cells.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an electro chemical cell having an electrolyte comprising water, a halogen other than fluorine, a halide other than fluoride, which is not oxidised by the halogen as a soluble salt, and a stable, saturated, organic nitrile or dinitrile containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms or a mixture thereof, said electrolyte being composed such as to exist in two phases, a first phase being halogen and nitrile rich and a second phase being water rich and contain ing halide salt, the cell having an inert electrode in the halogen and nitrile rich phase and an electrode, containing or contacting halogen oxidisable material, in the water rich phase. The electro chemical cell of the invention is particu larly applicable to systems containing zinc as the halogen oxidisable material. The use of the nitrile rich phase reduces the degree of reaction between the halogen and the halogen oxidisable material.
