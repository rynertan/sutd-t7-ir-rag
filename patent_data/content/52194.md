# Paging data processing apparatus.

## Abstract
An information processing unit and storage system comprising at least one low speed, high capacity main memory having relatively long access time and including a plurality of data pages stored therein and at least one high speed, low capacity Cache memory means having a relative ly short access time and adapted to store a predetermined plurality of subsets of the information stored in said main memory data pages. Instruction decoding means are located in the communication channel between the main Memory and the Cache which are operative to at least partially decode instructions being transferred from main Memory to Cache, expanding the instruction format from that utilized in the main Memory storage to one more readily executable by the processor prior to storing said instructions in the Cache. Logic is included for determining whether a given instruction is susceptible of partial decoding and for determining that a particular instruction has already been partially decoded. Separate Cache storage may be used for data and instructions respectively whereby only instructions being transferred from main Memory to Cache will pass through said decoding means.
