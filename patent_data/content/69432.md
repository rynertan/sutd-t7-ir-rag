# Pallet for exhibiting one or more objects.

## Abstract
The pallet 1 has a plate 28 with at least one slot 40 and a clamping member 31 mainly consisting of a web 32 and two limbs 33, 35 formed at the end thereof and being substantially at right angles thereto, said web 32 being passed through said slot 40 in a manner such that one 33 of the limbs extends below and one 35 of the limbs above said plate. The invention has for its object to provide a pallet in which there is no risk of disengagement of the clamping member occur, whilst there is no need for using an additional bottom plate. In order to achieve this object the invention proposes a pallet of the kind set forth, in which the clamping member has a substantially U shaped cross profile.

## Description
Short title Pallet for exhibiting one or more objects. The invention relates to a pallet for exhibiting one or more objects, for example, jewels, said pallet having a plate with at least one slot and a clamping member mainly consisting of a web and two limbs formed at the end thereof and being substantially at right angles thereto, said web being passed through said slot in a manner such that one of the limbs extends below and one of the limbs above said plate. Such a pallet is known. In the known pallet the clamping member is formed so that the limbs each extend in a different direction with respect to the web. For coupling the clamping member with the plate it is necessary to use, for example, glue between the limb on the bottom side of the plate and the corresponding part of the bottom surface of the plate.By the exertion of a clamping force by the limb on the top side of the plate in order to retain the objects to be shown a tensile force is exerted on the adhesive connection as a result of which the clamping member may readily disengage in repeated use or in the case of large objects. In order to mitigate this inconvenience to some extent it has been proposed to attach an additional bottom plate, for example, by glue to the entire bottom surface of the plate. This solution provides, in fact, some improvement, but it does not solve the prevailing difficulty in principle. The invention has for its object to provide a pallet in which the risk of disengagement of the clamping member does not occur, whilst there is no need for using an additional bottom plate. In order to achieve this object the invention proposes a pallet of the kind set forth in the preamble, in which the clamping member has a substantiallyU shaped cross profile. Particularly when a plate of rigid material is used, it is advantageous to employ a variant in which the slot is widened in downward direction and in the direction of the limbs of the fixed clamping member. In an advantageous embodiment the clamping member has an E shaped cross profile, the central limb of which overlaps the receiving slot. Moreover, the upper limb may be connected with a further limb through a downwardly extending bend. In order to ensure a satisfactory pivotal effect the profile may have a narrowed part in the region of the transition between the web and the upper limb. For mass production is particularly suitable a pallet in which the plate and the clamping member axe integral with one another. In this case the lower limb may be split whilst an elongate gap is left free. Thus the space beneath the plate is accessible from the side of the clamp, so that, for example, the price ticket on a ring remains invisible during presentation. The invention furthermore covers a separate clamping member as described above. The invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawing of some random embodiments.The drawing shows in Fig. 1 a perspective view of a pallet for exhibiting rings, Fig. 2 a cross sectional view taken along the plane Il Il in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a perspective view, partly broken away, of a detail of the pallet of Figs. 1 and 2, Fig. 4 a cross sectional view corresponding to Fig. 2 of a second embodiment of a pallet in accordance with the invention and Fig. 5 a perspective view of a third embodiment. Fig. 1 shows a pallet 1 comprising a plate 2 slightly depressed on the top surface and two clamping members 3, 4. These clamping members 3 and 4 have a web 5 and 6, an upper limb 7 and 8 and a further limb 11 and 12 adjoining the former through a downward curvature 9 and 10 and being parallel to the upper limb 7 and 8 respectively.The underside of the further limb 11, 12 has transverse ridges 13, 14 in order to avoid a shift of the objects such as rings 15, 16 to be shown Fig. 1 . In order to prevent the rings 15, 16 from entering, by awkward manipulation, into the space bounded by the web 5, 6, the upper limb 7, 8, the bend 9, 10 and the further limb 11, 12 the clamping members 3, 4 of this embodiment have a central limb 17, 18. Fig. 2 shows in further detail the clamping members 3, 4 and their connection with the plate 2. It is in particular apparent that the plate 2 has two slots 19, 20 for passing the web 5, 6, whilst the central limb 17, 18 has a length such that it overlaps the receiving slot 19, 20.It is particularly important to note that the clamping members 3, 4 have a lower limb 21, 22 extending on the same side of the web 5, 6 as the upper limb 7, 8. For reasons of a satisfactory aesthetic finish a bottom plate 23 is arranged on the underside of the plate 2. This bottom plate 23 has no technical function. In the region of the transition between the limb 5, 6 and the upper limb 7, 8 the profile has a narrowed part 24, 25. It is thus ensured that a satisfactory and unpredictable pivotal effect is obtained. Also with regard thereto the upper limb 7, 8 has a slightly thickened profile. Fig. 3 is an enlarged perspective view, partly broken away, from which the essential features of the present embodiment will even be more apparent. It will be seen that the plate 2 consists of a flat plate 26 and a rim 27 gripping around the same. Fig, 4 shows a variant in which a plate 28 is supported in inclined position by a front plate 29 and a rear plate 30. A clamping member 31 comprises a web 32, a lower limb 33, a central limb 34, an upper limb 35, a downwardly directed shoulder 36 adjoining the upper limb 35 and a further limb 37 adjoining said shoulder. The bottom surface of the further limb 39 is provided with transverse ridges 38. Sn the region of the transition between the web 32 and the upper limb 35 the profile of the clamping member 31 has a narrowed part 39. The plate 28 has a receiving slot 40, which is widened downwards in the direction of the limbs 33, 34, 35 of the fixed clamping member 31. This facilitates the insertion of the clamping member. The central limb 34 overlaps the receiving slot 40. Fig. 5 shows an integrated pallet 41 comprising a plate 42 and a clamping member 43. The plate 42 has an outwardly slightly tapering fastening plate 44 having ridges 52, a clamping plate 45 adjoining the plate 44 at an angle and a supporting plate 46 adjoining the end rim of the former at right angles. The clamping plate 45 and the supporting plate 46 have a longitudinal slot 47, through which the space 48 is accessible from above. Away from the clamping plate 45 extends a web 49 of the clamping member 43. The retracted limb 50 thereof has ridges 51. Fig. 5 illustrates the mode of clamping a ring 55. A price ticket 54 fastened by a cord 53 to the ring 55 is invisibly hidden in the space 48.
