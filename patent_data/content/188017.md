# Electroacoustic calling device.

## Abstract
An electroacoustic calling device comprises a two part housing 100,101 containing a piezoelectric disc 103 mounted between two knife edges 109, 110 and a loud speaker cone 104 which is attached to the centre of the piezoelectric disc by means of an adhesive. The upper part 101 of the housing has an aperture 102 through which sound waves are emitted. A closure member 105 for controlling the size of the aperture and hence the volume of sound emitted is urged against the surface of the housing by means of an arm 107 which is pivotally mounted on a boss 108 . The closure member 105 is in the form of a disc which is located in a recess 106 in the arm 107 and is urged against the housing by means of a projection 112 in the recess 106 . The essentially point contact between the disc and recess allows the disc to align accurately with the surface of the housing.
