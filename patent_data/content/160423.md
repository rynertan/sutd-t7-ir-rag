# COAXIAL CONNECTOR FOR CONTROLLED IMPEDANCE TRANSMISSION LINES

## Abstract
Two wiring boards 100, 124 are connected together on either side of an RF shield 112 by a pin 104 passing through a hole 118 in the shield 112 without touching the sides of the hole. The pin 104 is secured to one board 100 and engages a connector 132 carried by the other board 124 to connect circuits on the two boards. The arrangement of the invention is simpler than prior art arrangements using coaxial cables to connect wiring boards.
