## Description
Method of and Composition for Sizing and Fire Proofing Paper and Paper Made by the Method This invention relates to the treatment of a web of unsized paper with an aqueous composition of flame retardant salts and a sizing material to produce paper with good sizing, flame resistance and strength. The invention also relates to the composition usad for the treatment of the unsized paper and the paper produced by the treatment. It is known to treat paper to render it flame resistant. However, the materials that gre applied are expensive and can reduce both the strength and water resistance of the final paper. It has been proposed to render a paper both water and fire resistant. However, it is very difficult to achieve this because the addition to paper of fire retarding compounds usually decreases significantly the water resistance of the paper. Many methods have been proposed for preparing water and fire resistant paper and some of these are set out in British Patent No. 1 500 612, to theInternational Paper Company. It will be seen from this patent that there are many problems to be solved in finding a suitable process for preparing fire and water resistant paper. One of the major problems is that in may cues the fire retarding agent and the water repelling agent are incompatible. Another problem is that most solutions used to fire and water proof paper are acidic. These solutions attack the processing rollers in a paper mill and therefore make it necessary for the rollers to be replaced or refurbished frequently. This clearly adds to the cost of the paper making process and reduces its efficiency. It is an aim of the present invention to provide a papertreating solution which contains a compatible fire retardant and water repellant, and which does not corrode processing rollers to any substantial extent. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided an aqueous paper treating solution comprising from 10 to 70 parts of an ionic fire retardant material and from 0.2 to 1 part of an alkylketene dimer, wherein the solution has a pH from 7.8 to 8.2, preferably 8.0. The solution according to the present invention has the advantage that paper treated with it does not show any evidence of incompatibility of the components. There is no evidence of one or the other component being unabsorbed by the paper. Another advantage of the solution is that it is only mildly alkaline, so that it is unable to attack the processing rollers, thus enabling relatively cheap and efficient running of a paper processing plant.These advantages are obtained because of the careful control of the pH solution. Preferably the alkylketene dimer is supplied as an aqueous emulsion containing about 6 of the alkylketene dimer. The lsin ay also contain a cationic starch as a protective colloid. An especially suitable emulsion, supplied by HerculesPowder Company Limited, is Aquapel RTM 360X. This has a total solids content of 7.6 ,an alkylketene dimer content of 6 , specific gravity of 1.02 at 250C, a viscosity from 25 to 100 centipoise at 250C and a pH of 3.5 to 4.0. The fire retardant material may be based on sulphates, phosphates, borates or mixtures thereof. Preferably the fire retardant material comprises from 45 to 55 diammonium hydrogen phosphate, the balance being amonium sulphate. The fire retardant material may contain small amounts, up to about 10 of impurities. Preferably up to 30 parts of it are present in the solution. For good fire resistance it is desirable to have at least 10 parts of the fire retardant material present. The amount of water used to make the solution will be selected so that sufficient solution is taken up by the paper being treated to give the appropriate loading of water repellent and fire retardant on the paper. This can be easily determined experimentally by those skilled in the art. The solution may also contain wet strength agents and other additives used in the paper making industry. These are well known in the art. It is generally recommended to use a cationic retention aid with alkylketene dimer sizing agents. According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating a web of paper to render it fire and water resistant, comprising treating the paper with a solution according to the first aspect of the invention and drying the paper, wherein the treatment is such that the dried paper has a dry loading of fire retardant from 10 to 50 and of water repellent from 0.4 to 1 . weight of additive on paper The dry loading is calculated as weight of treated dry paper x 100. To achieve the appropriate loading it is possible to vary the concentration of the solution, the time of treatment or both. It is envisaged that the treatment will take place in a continuous process and the concentration of the solution will have to be arranged in relation to the speed of a web of paper passing through a treatment bath. According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a water and fire resistant paper when made according to the method of the second aspect of the invention. Water repellency is measured according to the Cobb test, which is BS 2644 1955. This measures the amount of water in grams absorbed by one square metre of paper in one minute. Thuswa good water repelling paper has a low Cobb value. Untreated handheet paper has a Cobb value in excess of 100.Handsheet paper treated according to the invention has a Cobb value of from 20 to 60. Handsheet paper treated with the fire retardant material alone has a Cobb value of over 100. If the pH of the solution is allowed to drop to about , the Cobb value of the handsheet paper rises to above 79. Acceptable Cobb values for sized paper are below 60. Fire retarding properties are measured by the TechnicalAssociation of Pulp and Paper Industry Standard Method T461m 48, TAPPI test which is also found as ASTM D 777 46 Reapproved 1965 . Papers treated according to the invention pass this test. There is no afterglow and the char length is less than 11.5 cm. Alkylketene dimers have been tested by the U.S. Food and DrugsAuthcrity and have been passed as acceptable for food wrapping paper additives as long as they are not present in quantities greater than 0.4 in the finished paper. This should be born in mind if the paper is to be used for food packaging. The present invention will be described, by way of example only, with reference to the following formulations, in which the quantities are in parts by weight.Formulation No. Water Ammonium Daimmonium hydrogen Aquapel Sulphate phosphate 360X 1 72.1 12.5 12.9 2.5 2 70.0 12.5 12.5 5.0 3 87.5 5.0 5.0 2.5 4 80.0 7.5 7.5 5.0 The pH of each formulation was adjusted to 8.0 by addition of sodium hydroxide. Sheets of unsized handshee paper, hazing a Cobb value of about 120 and no fire retardance were dipped into each formulation for about 1 second so that each sheet took of anen rately the same weight of solution. The sheet were then dried and weighed. The total weight uptake of solide for each sheet and its properties are given below.

The sheet strenghts were good and were not affected by the treatment. The appearance of the sheets is good, there being no browning or crystallation, indicating the compatibility of the system. The formulation were used in the treatment bath of a commercial paper making factory to treat continuous webs of paper. After hours use there was bo evidence of any corrosion of the rollers.
