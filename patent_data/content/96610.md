# Air separation process for the production of krypton and xenon.

## Abstract
The invention deals with an air separation process for the production of krypton and xenon. A liquid oxygen rich stream 73 is firstly stripped of hydrocarbon in a stripping column 40 and the resulting liquid oxygen rich stream 90 containing concentrated kryp ton and xenon is converted into a nitrogen rich stream 100 containing krypton and xenon in an exchange column 50 . This process allows a safely and efficiently production of krypton and xenon while minimizing the main plant burden.
