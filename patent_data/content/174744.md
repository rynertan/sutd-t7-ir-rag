# Fluorescent energy transfer with phycobiliproteins.

## Abstract
Improved dyes are provided comprising phycobilipro tens having covalently coupled thereto a plurality of small molecular weight organic dyes under conditions permitting energy transfer mechanisms to operate therebetween. The resultant label may then be used in virtually any immunoas say format.
