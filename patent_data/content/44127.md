# Test kit to identify potential contrast media reactors.

## Abstract
Method and kit are provided for determining hypersensi tivity of a patient, particularly to polyiodinated contrast media. Plasma from the patient is combined with a prekallik rein activator and a substrate capable of providing a detectible signal and the proteolttic activity measured by determining the signal level by means of the transformation of said substrate. The invention described herein was made in the course of, or under a grant from, the United States Public Health Service.
