# Filter for ostomy bags.

## Abstract
In a deodorizing gas filter for ostomy bags 22 , consist ing of a sheet 10 of deodorizing filter material, for example a porous foamed plastic with particles of active carbon, and having a central inlet opening 12 , a gas tight connecting layer 14 to the bag on one side of the filter sheet, and a gas tight covering layer 24 on the other side of the filter sheet, the covering layer consists of elastic film material, or is provided with a layer of elastic material at least in that part covering the central opening and an immediately surround ing zone thereof. This makes it possible to prick through the covering layer 24 and via the central opening also the bag in one with a needle, and still secure the desired passage of gas from the central opening 12 centrifugally through the filter, since the elastic material of or on the covering layer results in the needle hole closing and remaining closed at the pressures practically occuring in ostomy bags, whereas the needle hole in the bag, having the form of one or more short tears, remains open because the bag film is of a thermoplastic inelastic material. Possibly, the filter 28 affixed to the bag 22 may be covered with a cover 34 to prevent carbon particles possibly falling out from the filter sheet 10 from dirtying the ostomy bag, said cover being tearable on account of a weakening line 38 .
