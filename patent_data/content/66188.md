# Plastic encapsulated semiconductor device and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A plastic encapsulated semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the same are provided. A sub strate support supports a semiconductor substrate and serves as a heat sink. Strips 15, 16 are connected to one side of the substrate support and external leads 6, 10, 11 are connected to the opposite side of the substrate support. Parts of the strips extend from one side surface 26 of a plastic encapsulating housing. At least one notch or recess 23, 24 is formed in one side surface of the plastic encapsulating housing. The strips are then cut within at least one notch or recess so as not to extend the cut surfaces of the strips from the outermost side surface portion of the encapsulating housing.
