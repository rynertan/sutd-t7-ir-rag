# Temperature compensated gas meters.

## Abstract
A temperature compensator for gas meters is comprised of two serially connected bi metallic elements 62, 64 extending between the tangent post 30 and the drive shaft 40 from the flow responsive element. The bi metallic elements 62, 64 are reversely oriented whereby each element responds to a given temperature change to produce movement in the same direction as the other with respect to the axis of the drive shaft 40 .
