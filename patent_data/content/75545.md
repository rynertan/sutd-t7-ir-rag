## Description
A FILLER CONTAINING POLYESTER AND A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF The present invention relates to filler containing polyesters, preferably unsaturated polyesters, and to a process for the preparation thereof. Polyesters are condensation products of polyfuno tional acids and alcohols. Traditionally, the polyesters are divided into two types unsaturated polyesters which are used primarily as starting material for the manufacture of structural plastics, and saturated polyesters which are used primarily as paint binders. An important special case of the latter type are the alkydes, i.e.fatty acid modified, saturated polyesters Both types of polyesters are well known and are described below in order to explain the technique on which the present invention is based and to which it is applicable. By unsaturated polyester resins are meant polymer systems with unsaturation of the polyvalent acid or the alcohol included, the unsaturation being contained in the backbone polymer chain, not in a side chain. The term unsaturated polyester UP refers both to the resin and to the final plastic, and in the latter case the term provides an indication of how the polyester plastic has been obtained. Generally, unsaturated polyesters are prepared by causing a polyvalent alcohol and a polyvalent acid to react with one another, the acid component being constituted at least partly by a polyvalent unsaturated acid, such as maleic acid or fumaric acid. Usually, the acid component is a mixture of unsaturated and saturated, polyvalent acids, such as maleic acid and o phthalic acid.Other acids are isophthalic acid, adipic acid and azelaic acid. In many case, the acid anhydrides are used instead of the acids proper. The polyvalent alcohol is usually selected from a glycol, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol1 butylene glycol, diethylene glycol and dipropylene glycol. After the alcohol and acid components have reacted with one another, there is obtained an unsaturated polyester resin which, because of its unsaturation, can further react with another, unsaturated monomer This monomer usually is styrene, although also other unsaturated monomers, such as vinyl toluene, methyl metacrylate, diallyl phthalate and triallyl cyanurate may be used.Frequently, the monomer also functions as a solvent, i.e.it acts as a reactive solvent for the components included. Undesired curing of the polyester resin by reaction with the unsaturated monomer can be prevented by adding an inhibitor, such as hydroquinone. In this manner, the mixture will be stable for a long time. To initiate the curing reaction, use is made of an initiator, usually an organic peroxide, such as benzoylperoxide, or a hydroperoxide, such as methylethyl ketone peroxide, methyl isobutyl peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide. The initiator is activated by means of an activator or promotor which usually consists of a cobalt salt, such as cobalt octoate or cobalt naphthenate, or of dimethyl aniline. As in most other plastic materials, organic or inorganic fillers are sometimes used in unsaturated.poly esters. The filler is used on the one hand to impart specific characteristics to the product. and, on the other hand, to reduce its price. One type of filler is silica which is used both in the form of natural silica, primarily quartz in different crystalline shapes and in the form of synthetic silica. Pulverulent synthetic silica is available in different forms, among which may be mentioned silica aerogel which is a colloidal silica prepared by substituting a low boiling water miscible organic liquid for the water of a silica hydrogel l heating in an autoclave above the critical temperature of the liquid, and then venting the autoclave 2 so called pyrogenic silica which is a colloidal silica obtained by burning silica tetrachloride and collecting the resulting silica smoke 3 precipitated silica which is obtained by precipitating silicic acid from a sodium silicate solution, for instance by adding a mineral acid. The precipitated silica is easy to manufacture and therefore is comparatively cheap. Generally, however, only reasonably small particles of the order of about 50 100 nm are obtained. Manufacture of the pyrogenic silica is relatively complicated but, on the other hand, gives small particles having a large surface area. However, the pyrogenic silica is expensive and has found but restricted use as a filler, inter alia in the polyester plastic industry to impart structural viscosity to so called gel coats. The pyrogenic silica is admixed in minor amounts only, about 1 58 by weight. A common feature of the above mentioned types of silica is that they are used but to a limited extent as fillers for polyesters, and then they are admixed in low percentages of but a few percent. Besides, their completely homogenous distribution in the plastic material is difficult to achieve. A further type of synthetic silica in the context of the present application is so called silica hydrosol, i.e. a colloidal aqueous solution of silica. The particle size of this silica is very. small about 5 20 nm , and the particles thus have a large surface area. Because of the water present in this type of silica, it cannot be used as a filler for polyesters. In addition to the unsaturated polyesters described above, the invention is applicable also to so called saturated polyesters, especially fatty acid modified, saturated polyesters, so called alkyds. The saturated polyesters distinguish over the unsaturated polyesters in that they do not contain any unsaturation in the backbone polymer chain. On the other hand, unsaturation may be found in a side chain if the alkyd contains acids of drying oils. Among the saturated or aromatic acids and alcohols of which saturated polyesters are composed, mention may be made of those previously referred to in connection with the unsaturated polyesters. Furthermore, 3 and 4 valent alcohols, such as glycerol, trimethylol propane and pentaerythritol may be mentioned. As has been stated above in connection with gel coat, silica is used as a filler also in saturated polyesters in order to achieve increased viscosity and thixotropy. The present invention has for its object to provide a filler containing polyester and a process of making said polyester, the filler consisting of colloidal silica in a higher content than has previously been the case, and the silica being extremely homogeneously distributed in the polyester. In this manner, improved characteristics are imparted to the finished product, such as increased hardness, scratch hardness and resistance to chemicals. It has now been discovered, in connection with the present invention, that these objects are achieved by utilizing as the silica filler a silica organosol, i.e. a colloidal solution of silica in a dispersion medium consisting of z polyvalent alcohol which, at the same time, constitutes at least part of the alcohol component of the polyester. The polyvalent alcohol of the silica organosol preferably constitutes the alcohol component of the entire polyester. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process of preparing a filler containing polyester, said process being characterized in that an acid component including a polyvalent carboxylic acid is caused to react with an alcohol component which at least partly consists of a silica organosol having a polyvalent alcohol as dispersion medium. Furthermore, the invention also relates to an agent for preparing a filler containing polyester, said agent being characterized in that it consists of a silica organosol having a polyvalent alcohol as dispersion medium. Other characteristic features of the invention will appear from the appended nonindependent claims. Silica organosols are previously known in and per se and are made from silica hydrosol by adding an organic solvent and driving off water. In some cases, the addition of the organic solvent is preceded by an ion exchange of the sol. However, as far as is known, such silica organosols have as yet not found any major commercial use, and in particular they have not been used for the purpose of the present invention. The particle size of the silica in the silica organosol utilized for this invention lies within the colloidal range, i.e. 1 100 nm and preferably is about 5 20 nm. In the present invention, the silica content of the organosol is about 10 60 by weight, preferably about 15 50 by weight, which corresponds to a content of about 5 25 by weight of silica in the polyester resin, and about 4 20 by weight in the finished plastic. As has been mentioned before, the polyvalent alcohol which is the dispersion medium in the silica organosol according to the present invention is, at the same time, the alcohol component of the polyester, and the alcohol thus is selected among the different polyvalent alcohols which may be used for this purpose and of which specific examples have been given above. Generally, divalent to tetravalent alcohols are used, especially ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, glycerol and pentaerythritol. Since the silica is in the form of a colloid in the alcohol dispersion medium and is completely homogeneously distributed therein, the silica, upon mixture of the acid component of the polyester and the alcohol component thereof which thus consists at least partly of the silica organosol, will also be distributed homogeneously and in the form of colloidal particles in the polyester. Such a homogeneous distribution cannot be achieved if dry silica is used, such as precipitated or pyrogenic silica, since the primary particles of such a silica are formed into agglomerates which remain more or less intact after admixture. A further difference between the invention and the use of conventional silica as a filler resides in that there is obtained, for instance when pyrogenic silica is used as a filler for gel coat, an intense viscosity increase necessitating the use of a special kneading apparatus, whereas no such phenomena appear when the silica organosol according to the present invention is used. In the following, some Examples of different forms of the invention are given, and these Examples are merely intended to illustrate the invention and should not be interpreted as restrictive. In all Examples, the organosol was prepared by adding a polyol to an ion exchanged silicic acid sol in water, whereupon the water was driven off by vacuum, as disclosed in, for instance, U.S. patent specification 3,699,043.EXAMPLE 1 220 g adipic acid and 150 g maleic anhydride were added to 350 g of organosol which consisted of 65 ethylene glycol and 35 silicic acid sol. The mixture was heated and stirred under nitrogen gas. The reaction began at about 0 140 C, and the resulting water was distilled off. The tem perature was increased gradually to 1900C. After about 16 h at this temperature, the acid number hÅad been reduced to about 50 mg KOH g. The temperature was then reduced to 0 added that, 90 C, whereupon 280 g styrene were added After that, the mixture was cooled to room temperature.EXAMPLE 2 115 adipic acid, 120 g phthalic anhydride and 155 g maleic SSydride were added to 430 g organosol which con o c sisted of 5. 5 ethylene glycol and 45 silicic acid. Xylene about tOt ml was added, and the reaction mixture was about fQI ml heated afid stirred under nitrogen gas. The reaction began 0 at about 120 C. The resulting water was driven off azeo trdpically, and all xylene was recycled to the reaction mixture. The reaction temperature was successively in 0 creased and, after 10 h, was 170 C. The acid number was then about 60 mg KOH g. The xylene was then driven off at about 2100C, when the acid number was reduced to about 50 mg KOH g. The reaction mixture was rapidly cooled to 900C, 235 g styrene were added1 and the solution was then cooled to room temperature. EXAMPLE 3 160 g adipic acid, 160 g maleic anhydride and 80 g phthalic anhydride were added to 465 g organosol which consisted of 408 ethylene glycol, 15 propylene glycol and 45 silicic acid. Xylene about 75 ml was added, and the mixture was heated and vigorously stirred under nitro gen gas. The resulting water was boiled off azeotropically at about 1200C. The temperature was successively increased to 1700C. When the acid number after about 10 h had been reduced to about 60 mg KOH g, the xylene was removed at about 210 0C, when the acid number was reduced to about 50 mg KOH g. 0 The reaction mixture was cooled to 90 C, whereupon 250 g styrene were added, and the solution was cooled to room temperature. EXAMPLE 4 The polyester resins prepared according to Examples 1 3 were cured with methylethyl ketone peroxide 3 as initiator and cobalt octoate 1 as activator. Panels having a thickness of 1 cm were molded and tested in respect of flexural strength at break, surface hardness and resistance to chemicals. The reference employed is a conventional polyester prepared in accordance with Example 3, except that the silicate has been removed therefrom, i.e. the organosol 465 g was replaced by a mixture of ethylene glycol 186 g and propylene glycol O g . The values obtained are shown in the Table below. The flexural strength at break was measured in a conventional tension testing machine. The surface hardness was determined in a so called Micro indentationApparatus made by ICI , and the expression E 1 92 E modulus of elasticity and v Poisson s number is obtained as a measure of the hardness. To determine the resistance to chemicals, test samples were kept for 7 days at 23 0C immersed in different solvents, followed by visual evaluation.

Xylene about 50 ml was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 200 2250C under azeotropic distillation of water. At the acid number 5 mgKOH g, the reaction was discontinued.After dilution to 70 content of solid matter in a mixture of xylene and ethyl glycol in a volume ratio of 60 40, a product was obtained whose viscosity was about 2000 mPa.s.EXAMPLE 6 The alkyd resin prepared according to Example S was tested in respect of its characteristics as a lacquer. The corresponding non silicate modified alkyd resin was used as a reference. Clear lacquers were manufactured from the two alkyds by mixing each alkyd separately with the melamine resinCIBAMIN M100 in the ratio 75 25, based upon the content of dry binder. The lacquers were applied to glass plates 0 and cured for 20 minutes at 200 C. The hardness and flexi bility of the lacquer films was determined by means of a Wallace and an Erichsen measuring device, respectively.The resistance to chemicals was determined visually after immersion in a solvent for 1 h at 23 0C.
