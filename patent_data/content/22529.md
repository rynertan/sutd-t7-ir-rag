## Description

Processes fpr the preparation of d 2 6methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid are described in U.S.Nos. 3,651,106 3,652,683 3,658,858 3,658,863 3,663,584 3,904,682 3,904,683 and 3,975,432. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In summary, the process of this invention comprises resolving mixtures of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid or soluble salts thereof with N R D glucamine or a salt thereof, where R is alkyl having 2 to 36 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 18 carbon atoms, or cycloalkyl having 3 to 8 carbon atoms to yield a product substantially enriched in d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, the pharmaceutically active agent. Racemic mixtures of d and 1 2 6 .ethoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid as they occur after known chemical synthesis are the presently preferred starting material for the resolution method of this invention. The term alkyl as used herein refers to and includes straight and branched chain hydrocarbon groups having 2 to 36 carbon atoms. Typical alkyl groups include ethyl, n propyl, i propyl, n butyl, i butyl, n hexyl, n octyl, n dodecyl, n octadecyl, n docosanyl, n hexatricontanyl, and the like. The term cycloalkyl as used herein refers to and includes cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon groups having 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Typical cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclohexyl, cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl. Of the cycloalkyl groups, cyclohexyl is presently preferred. Presently preferred resolving agents within the scope of this invention are N n propyl D glucamine,N n butyl D glucamine, and N n octyl D glucamine. The resolution contemplated by this invention is conducted in an inert organic solvent having a pronounced difference between the solubilities of the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent and the salt of 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent, generally at temperatures between room or ambient temperature and an elevated temperature generally up to the reflux temperature of the solvent utilized.The salt of d 2 6 methoxy2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent for example, N n propyl D glucamine, N n butyl D glucamine orN n octyl D glucamine should be significantly less soluble in the solvent than is the salt of 1 2 6methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent and, accordingly, upon the cooling of a heated solution thereof, generally to or about ambient or room temperature, such salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent will be preferentiaily crystallized therefrom.Suitable solvents include water, C1 to C10 monohydric alcohols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, cyclohexanol, 2 ethylhexanol, benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol, and the like, C2 to C6 dihydric alcohols, such as, for example, ethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol, 1,3 propylene glycol, and the like,C3 to C4 trihydric alcohols, such as for example, glycerol, and the like, C3 to C11 ketones, such as, for example, acetone, acetylacetone, ethyl methyl ketone, diethyl ketone, di n propyl ketone, diisopropyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, and the like. Other solvents include mono and di lower alkyl ether of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolanes, formamide, dimethylformamide, N methyl pyrrolidone, pyridine, dioxane, dimethylacetamide, and the like.The C1 to C3 alcohols, e.g. methanol and isopropanol, particularly methanol, are the presently preferred solvents. Sufficient water can be added to the solvent if needed to solubilize all of the materials which have been added thereto. The starting material i.e., the mixture of d 2 6methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and 1 2 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propionic acid or soluble salts thereof is heated to an elevated temperature, generally to a temperature in the range from about 600C to about 1000C or the reflux temperature of the solvent, in the presence of the resolving agent to solubilize all of the materials which have been added to the solvent. If desired, the solvent can be held at the elevated temperature until all of the materials have gone into solution. After the solution has been held at the elevated temperature for the desired length of time, it is slowly cooled to ambient temperature.During the cooling process, the solution is preferably seeded with a salt of d 2 6methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and the resolving agent e.g., the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with N n propyl D glucamine . The crystalline precipitate which results is enriched in the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent. The final temperature to which the solution is taken is chosen by practical considerations but generally is selected so that the temperature difference will be sufficient to provide a high yield of crystals. The crystallizing mixture can be maintained at the lower temperature until crystallization is complete, or nearly so, usually for about 30 minutes to about several hours or so. The crystalline precipitate which results is removed by filtration and washed. The crystalline material which is obtained at this stage in the process i.e., a material which is enriched in the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent , after separation by filtration and washing, can be charged to water and heated, if necessary, to redissolve the crystalline material. For those N R D glucamines which are soluble in water, the resulting solution is acidified for example with a mineral acid, such as sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, and the crystalline precipitate so obtained is separated by filtration, washed and dried. There results a white crystalline product substantially enriched in d 2 6methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid.Alternatively, for those N R D glucamines which are insoluble in water, the material enriched in the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propionic acid with such a resolving agent can be treated with a strong base, such as, for example, potassium hydroxide or other strong base having a pKa value greater than 10, to cleave the salt, followed by filtration to remove the resolving agent and acidification of the filtrate with, for example, a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, to give, after filtration, washing and drying, a white crystalline product substantially enriched in d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. Prior to the cleavage of the material enriched in the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent to obtain d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, it is generally desirable to redissolve the enriched salt material in further solvent material, heat the solvent to the desired normally elevated temperature, seed the resultant solution with the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent, and cool the resultant solution to effect one or more further recrystallizations. Each such recrystallization further increases the proportion of the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with the resolving agent in the recrystallized material. N n propyi D glucamine, N n butyl D glucamine, andN n hexyl D glucamine are particularly suitable resolving agents within the scope of this invention because, with merely one recrystallization step prior to the redissolution of the resultant crystalline product and subsequent acidification, a product having a purity on the order of about 97 99 d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid can be obtained. N n octyl D glucamine, however, is the presently preferred resolving agent because, with use ofN n octyl D glucamine, the salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propionic acid with N n octyl D glucamine is readily recoverable by filtration, d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphtnyi propionic acid of acceptably high optical purity can be obtained without need for one or more recrystalli zations prior to the cleaving step, and the resolving agent can be recovered directly and in high yield on the order of about 97 98 by filtration. Additionally, the cleavage can be conducted under either alkaline or acidic conditions. Alkaline cleavage results in a precipitate of N n octyl D glucamine while the d 2 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propionic acid remains in solution in the alkaline medium.Acidic cleavage results in a precipitate of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid while the N n octyl D glucamine remains in solution in the acidic medium. The N n octyl D glucamine is substantially insoluble in water, thus permitting recovery thereof in high yields from aqueous systems. This is also true for other resolving agents of this invention where R is alkyl having at least 6 carbon atoms, e.g., those resolving agents where R is alkyl having from 6 to 18 carbon atoms. The material enriched in i 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid or the N R D glucamine salt thereof whereR is as defined above can be processed to recover 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid which can then be racemized according to known techniques to give a material having a higher content of d 2 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propionic acid. See, for example, Dyson U.S.Patent No. 3,686,183. This material can be recycled, either alone or in combination with other d,l 2 6methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, to provide additional starting material for the resolution process of this invention. The amount of resolving agent employed on a molar basis relative to the d,l 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid being resolved in accordance with the present invention ranges from between about 50 and 100 . However, as only about 50 on a molar basis relative to the d,l 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid being resolved of the resolving agent is needed to form the more insoluble salt thereof with the d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, the remainder of the resolving agent generally on the order of up to about 40 50 molar can be replaced, if desired, with a more inexpensive base, including, for example, an inorganic base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or an organic tertiary amine such as triethylamine, triethanolamine, tributylamine, etc. The aqueous mother liquors resulting from the isolation of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid contain, for example, salts of the resolving agent with the acid utilized in the acidification step. Such mother liquors can be treated with an inorganic base to form the corresponding insoluble salt with the N R D glucamine, such as, for example, treatment with a suspension of calcium hydroxide to precipitate the corresponding calcium salt, which is removed by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated under vacuum at elevated temperatures to dryness, first removing any further salt, e.g. the calcium salt, which is formed during the early stages of the concentration process.The residue is dissolved in a suitable solvent at an elevated temperature up to the reflux temperature of the solvent, and then cooled to room temperature, to thereby afford the resolving agent as a crystalline precipitate which can be reused, either alone or in combination with new material, in the resolution process of this invention. Alternatively, the resolving agent can be recovered through use of an anion exchange resin and recycled for reuse. The terms mixture of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid is also intended to include those salts thereof which are soluble in the solvent utilized in the resolution process of this invention. Such salts include, for example, the corresponding sodium salts, potassium salts, lithium salts, and the like. Such salts can be prepared by the addition of base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example, sodium or potassium hydroxide, to a solution of the mixture of the d and 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid. The resulting mixture of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid and.1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid salts can be resolved according to the present invention by use of a salt of the resolving agent which will react to form a salt of d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid with theN R D glucamine. Suitable glucamine salts include, for example, the hydrochloride salt and the acetate salt.Other salts include the propionate salt, butyrate salt, isobutyrate salt, sulfate salt, nitrate salt, and the like. Accordingly, the term N R D glucamine where R is as defined above is intended to include those salts thereof which, when used with an appropriate salt of the mixture of d and 1 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, will afford the resolution contemplated hereby. The N R D glucamine salts of d 2 6 methoxy 2naphthyl propionic acid are useful as anti inflammatory, analgesic, and or antipyretic agents, platelet aggregation inhibitors, fibrinolytic agents and as smooth muscle relaxants. The aforesaid salts are also useful in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea and are agents for alleviating post menopausal symptoms. Accordingly, such salts would be useful in the treatment and elimination of inflammation such as inflammatory conditions of the muscular skeletal system, skeletal joints and other tissues, for example, in the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatism, concussion, laceration, arthritis, bone fractures, post traumatic conditions, and gout. In those cases in which the above conditions include pain and pyrexia coupled with inflammation, such salts would be useful for the relief of these conditions as well as the inflammation. Administration of the aforesaid salts in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition can be via any of the accepted modes of administration of agents for the treatment of inflammation, pain, or pyrexia. Thus, administration can be, for example, orally, parenterally as by, e.g., injection , or topically, in the form of solid, semi solid or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquid solutions, suspensions, creams, lotions, ointments, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages.Such pharmaceutical compositions will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a salt of N R D glucamine with d 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. The preferred manner of administration is oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. Generally, a daily dose of from 2 mg. to 20 mg. of the aforesaid salt per kilogram of body weight is used. For such oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic composition is formed by an incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like.Such compositions take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations and the like. A suppository using, for example, polyalkylene glycols, such as polypropylene glycol, as the carrier can be formulated. Liquid pharmaceutically administerable compositions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, etc. the aforesaid salt and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifing agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art for example, see Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences,Hack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, 14thEdition, 1970. The composition to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the aforesaid salt s in a pharmaceutically effective amount for relief of the particular condition being treated in accordance with the teachings hereof. The aforesaid salts are also uterine smooth muscle relaxants and thus are useful as agents for maintaining the pregnancy of pregnant mammals, for the benefit of the mother and or the fetus, until termination of the pregnancy is considered, from a medical point of view, to be favorable, or more favorable, for the mother and or the fetus. It should be understood, however, that in certain instances, for example where parturition has already begun i.e., the mother is experiencing uterine contractions, especially near full term , that administration of the aforesaid salts may not maintain the pregnant state for an indefinite period of time.Rather, in such instances, the pregnancy will, most probably, be slightly prolonged , a factor which may be advantageous to either the mother and or the fetus. The aforesaid salts are also used as agents for delaying the onset of, or for postponing, parturition.As used in this application, the phrase to delay the onset of parturition is intended to cover that delay in parturition caused by the administration of one of the aforesaid salts at any time before uterine muscle contractions have begun. Thus, it is intended that the aforementioned phrase cover abortion prevention early in pregnancy i.e., before the fetus is viable as well as delaying premature parturition, a term which sometimes is used with reference to that premature labor experienced later in the pregnancy which the fetus is considered to be viable . In either case, the agents are administered as prophylatic agents in that such administration tends to prevent the onset of parturition.This administration is particularly useful in the treatment of women having a history of spontaneous abortion, miscarriage or premature delivery i.e., delivery prior to full term . Such administration is also useful where there are clinical indications that the pregnancy might be terminated prior to that time considered favorable to the mother and or fetus. As used in this application, the phrase postponing parturition is intended to cover that delay in parturition caused by the administration of one of the aforesaid salts after uterine muscle contraction have begun. The condition of the patient, including the time within the gestation period when the contractions have begun, the severity of the contractions and how long the contractions have taken place will affect the results achieved. For example, the effect can be to reduce the intensity and or the duration of the contractions the actual act of parturition being prolonged , or to stop the contractions altogether. In either case, the effect will be to prolong the gestation period although, depending upon the condition of the patient as described above, the effect may either be slight or, under appropriate circumstances, somewhat greater.Such administration may be to prevent spontaneous abortion, to cause the delivery to be more easily accomplished and or less painful to the mother, or to occur at a more appropriate time and or place. With respect to animals, this treatment can also be utilized to synchronize the deliveries from a group of pregnant animals to happen at or about the same time, or to happen at or about a desired time and or place, when the births can be handled with greater facility. In all cases, administration should be consistent with best and or accepted medical or veterinary practices so as to maximize the benefits to the mother and the fetus. For example, administration should not be continued so long past full term that the fetus dies in utero. In the practice of this aspect of the present invention, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the aforesaid salts or a pharmaceutical composition containing an aforesaid salt is administered to the pregnant mammal via any of the usual and acceptable tods known in the art. The salt can be administered either singly or in combination with another compound or compounds, as defined above, or other pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. Such salt s or compositions can be administered orally or parenterally in the doses and in the forms including oral, vaginal or uterine tablets or suppositories, etc. as set forth above regarding anti inflammatory, etc. activities. Administration can be a single daily dose or up to 3 or 4 smaller doses regularly given throughout the day. The actual amount of the salt administered will, of course, depend on its relative activity for this particular utility.
