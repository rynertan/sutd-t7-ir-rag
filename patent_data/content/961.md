## Description
Phosphor containing compositions and their use in X ray photographs. The present invention relates to phosphor containing compositions of matter and more particularly to improved radiation conversion screens comprising halide containing phosphors and a process for producing such compositions and screens. A first class of radiation conversion screens areX ray intensifying screens containing fluorescent substances which are employed for absorbing X rays and converting said rays into light to which silver halide of a photographic material is more sensitive than to directX ray exposure. These screens also called radiographic intensifying screens are customarily arranged inside a cassette, so that each side of a silver halide film, emulsion coated on both sides, after the cassette has been closed is in intimate contact with an adjacent screen.In exposing the film the X rays pass through one side of the cassette, through one entire intensifying front screen, through the light sensitive silver halide film emulsion coated on both sides and strike the fluorescent substances phosphor particles of the second rear intensifying screen. This causes both screens to fluoresce and to emit fluorescent light into at least the adjacent silver halide emulsion layer, which is inherently sensi tive or spectrally sensitized to the light emitted by the screens. A second class of radiation conversion screens are the so called fluoroscopic screens . Such screens have the function of producing a directly viewable image in correspondence with a pattern of penetrating radiation. A third class of radiation conversion screens are fluorescent screens used in conjunction with a photocathode that emits photoelectrons under the influence of the fluorescent light of the screen. Such screens find application e.g. in image intensifier or image conversion tubes. In said tubes normally also a fluorescent screen is present which transforms the impact of fast moving electrons in light. The commonly used X ray intensifying screens comprise a support and a layer of fluorescent particles dispersed in a coherent film forming macromolecular binder medium.Normally a protective coating is applied on top of the fluorescent layer to shield said layer from ambient influences e.g. moisture, air and mechanical abrasion. Usually these protective coatings are composed of cellulose derivatives or synthetic polymers as described, e.g., in the United States Patent Specification 5,164,719 of Herbert Bauer, issued January 5, 1965. Generally, layers comprising cellulosic derivatives are somewhat permeable to moisture and therefore more hydrophobic but also more costly synthetic polymers e.g.polymers containing fluorine atoms are applied to shield the phosphor layer from moisture. The protection from moisture is required not only to prevent the fluorescent layer from staining but also to prevent water from adsorbing to the phosphor particles.Unlike calcium tungstate a broad class of halide containing phosphors is more or less hygroscopic and even small amounts of water reduce the fluorescent light emitting power of the phosphor after a certain time so that the intensifying screen becomes useless in the long run. So far one has only tried to remedy these defects as described in the United States Patent Specifications 3,164 ,719, already mentioned hereinbefore and 3,836,78lie of Clayton W.Bates and Reichard A.Wallace, issued September 17, 19 4, e.g. by mixing the phosphor particles with a hydrophobic polymeric binder or by coating the phosphor layer with a special protective highly water impermeable layer. The hydrophobic polymers have to be used in rather large amounts, which reduces the light emitting power of the screen. The protective layers do not always have the desired mechanical strength and adherence to the phosphor layer and often require a high temperature coating procedure because of poor solubility of the polymers. It is an object of the present invention to provide a composition of matter, which incorporates halide containing phosphor particles, and wherein the phosphor particles are better protected against the influence of moisture and loss of fluorescence power. It is more particularly an object of the present invention to provide better moisture resistant radiation conversion screens incorporating particles of a halidecontaining phosphor. It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing such screens having an improved stability with respect to their fluorescent lightemitting power. In accordance with the present invention a composition of matter is provided, which composition includes halidecontaining phosphor particles, which are admixed or combined in contact with or have reacted with at least one organic compound in such a way that the fluorescing power of the phosphor particles is less susceptible to the deleterious influence of humidity and wherein said organic compound is a non metal organic compound corresponding to one of the following general formulae R X and X R1 X whereinR represents a monovalent organic group, preferably of at least 6 carbon atoms e.g. a hydrocarbon group,R1 represents a bivalent organic group,preferably of at least 6 carbon atoms e.g. a bivalent hydrocarbon group, with the proviso that these R and R1 groups contain no reactive hydrogen such as contained in X, andX represents a group containing reactive hydrogen, with which said compound by reacting with acetyl chloride is capable of splitting off chlorine therefrom in the form of hydrogen chloride in the circumstances of the test A below, e.g. mercapto, a primary or secondary amino group, carboxyl or hydroxyl, and wherein said compound at 150C has a solubility of no more than 5 g in 100 ml of water. In the formula X R1 X the groups X may be the same or different chemical groups. Teet A Stoichiometric amounts of acetyl chloride and of the organic compound to be examined are dissolved in anhydrous benzene and refluxed herein for 24 h in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of pyridine. The pyridinium chloride formed is separated from the cooled reactive mixture 200C by filtering or centrifuging. If pyridinium chloride crystals happen to be contained in the cooled reaction mixture, the compound meets the demand, viz. to be usable as a stabilising agent in the present invention. If the organic compound to be examined is a primary or secondary amine, pyridine may be omitted from the reaction mixture and the chlorides corresponding with these amines form in the reaction. Pyridine is normally used as hydrogen chloride scavenger in alcoholysis see John H.Billman and ElisabethS.Cleland in Methods of Synthesis in Organic Chemistry Edward Brothers, Inc. Ann Arbor, Mich., U.S.A. 1951 78.The use of pyridine as condensing agent in the preparation of acid anhydrides starting from a carboxylic acid chloride and a carboxylic acid has been described byWagner and Zook, Synthetic Organic Chemistry John Wiley and Sons 1953 558. Suitable non metal organic compounds are non metal organic compounds according to the above general formulae wherein X is a mercapto group, a primary or secondary amino group, a carboxyl group or a hydroxyl group, which is linked to an aliphatic group or aromatic nucleus. The invention includes compositions of matter as hereinbefore defined wherein an organic compound s having said effect of stabilising the phosphor against the influence of moisture is are present at the surfaces of the phosphor particles. Such compound s is are applied to or deposited on the phosphor particles, or result from a reaction with such phosphor particles e.g.after it they has have been dissolved in a liquid medium and then brought in dissolved state into contact with the phosphor particles. The invention includes compositions of matter as hereinbefore defined wherein the phosphor particles bearing one or more organic compounds affording protection against moisture are dispersed in a binder. The invention also includes any intensifying screen consisting of or incorporating a layer formed wholly or in part of a composition of matter according to the invention as above defined, with or without any one or more of the optional features above or hereinafter referred to. A preferred optional feature resides in the employment as agent for the purposes of reducing the adverse effects of moisture on the phosphor, of an organic compound or a combination of such compounds whose potential protective power satisfies a certain test. This test hereafter called the Standard Test 1 has been devised for the purpose of assessing the level of effectiveness of any selected organic compounds for phosphor protection in accordance with the invention and is as followsStandard test 1 An X ray image intensifying screen Screen A is pre pared from the following composition terbium activated lanthanum oxybromide phosphor 100 g organic substance compound or combination of organic compounds to be tested 0.5 g poly vinyl n butyral containing 12 by weight of non acetalized vinyl alcohol units and having an average molecular weight of 50,000 12.5 g ethylene glycol monomethyl ether 48 g by ball milling to reduce the particle size to 7 NS Hegman Fineness measured with a Hegman gage as specified in ASUM 1210, filtering the resulting dispersion, de aerating it and applying the com position to a baryta coated paper of 290 g per m2 at a coverage of 500 g m2. 2 A second X ray image intensifying screen screen B is prepared in the same way as screen A except that the organic substance to be tested is omitted. 3 Screen A is treated with moisture by applying onto the phosphor layer of the screen a wet circular piece of filter paper having a dry weight of 1.355 g, a dia meter of 15 cm and a water content of 3100 g, air tightly enclosing the screen A together with the applied filter paper in a polyethylene bag, keeping the bag for 64 h at 600C in a ventilated cabinet and then removing the screen from the bag, removing the filter paper and drying the screen in air for 30 min at 800C. 4 The screens A and B the former having been moisture treated as above described are subjected to an X ray exposure while the phosphor layers are in contact with distinct areas of the same silver halide emulsion layer of a photographic material having a transparent emulsion layer support and the exposed photographic material is developed, the X ray exposure and develop ment being such that in the area of the emulsion layer which was in contact with screen B a spectral density of at least 1.00 above inherent fog is obtained and the composition of the silver halide material and the development being such that gradually increasing exposures of the silver halide emulsion area in contact with screen B would give a silver image density versus log exposure curve having a gamma value maximum gra dient of the characteristic curve of 3 5 the densities DA and D3 obtained in the areas of the emulsion layer, which were exposed in contact with screens A and B are measured 6 the actual loss of fluorescent light emitting power of the moisture treated screen A is computed on the basis of the spectral densities DA and D3 measured in step 5 above and the gamma value 3. An organic compound or combination of organic compounds is regarded as satisfying the above Standard Test if the result of the determination in step 6 is that the fluorescent light emitting power of screen A incorporating that compound or combination of compounds is at least 25 of that of the non moisture treated screen B. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention the organic compound s affording the moisture protection. is are such that when such compound s is are used in screenA in the Standard Test the fluorescent light emitting power of screen A is at least 65 and most preferably at least 75s9 of that of the non moisture treated screen B. If screen B in the Standard Test were to be moisturetreated like screen A before being subjected to the exposure and development moisture treated screen B would show a fluorescent power of less than 10 relative to that of the non moisture treated screen B. As already indicated a mixture or combination of organic stabilizing compounds can be employed in any one screen composition. Preferably use is made of at least one organic compound, which is colourless and upon reaction with the phosphor yields a colourless hydrophobic reaction product at the surface of the phosphor particles. A first class of suitable organic compounds for use according to this invention comprises organic compounds wherein reactive hydrogen is directly bound to sulphur, e.g. in thiols. Preferably thiols are used that contain a hydrocarbon group of at least 6 carbon atoms. Such thiols including aliphatic as well as aromatic representatives have been described by Arthur I.Vogel, Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, Longmans 3rd ed. 1959 p. 502. Very good results are obtained with 1 n dodecanethiol laurylmercaptan . A second class of organic compounds for use according to this invention are organic compounds that contain the reactive hydrogen in an amino group, i.e. primary or secondary amines. Preferably aliphatic primary or secondary amines are used that contain a hydrocarbon group of at least 8 carbon atoms. Especially good results are obtained with 1 n dodecylamine laurylamine . A third class of organic compounds for use according to this invention are organic compounds that contain the reactive hydrogen in a carboxyl group. Preferably aliphatic carboxylic acids are used that contain a hydrocarbon group of at least 6 carbon atoms. Very good results are obtained with dodecanoic acid lauric acid , but aliphatic carboxylic acids containing more than one carboxyl group are considered too, e.g. hexadecylenesuccinic acid and octadecylsuccinic acid. A fourth class of organic compounds for use according to this invention are organic compounds that contain the reactive hydrogen in a hydroxyl group, which is preferably linked to a hydrocarbon group of at least 6 carbon atoms, such as e.g. in lauryl alcohol, p t amylphenol and isohexadecyl alcohol. The hydrocarbon groups as referred to hereinbefore may comprise substituents that do not enhance the watersolubility of the organic compounds beyond the already given value. Suitable substituents rendering the compounds more hydrophobic are halogen atoms, e.g. fluorine, chlorine and bromine, such as e.g. in p bromophenol and perfluorocaprylic acid. The above mentioned organic compounds can be used in combination with metal organic compounds that are described as stabilisers for halide containing phosphor particles in the DE OS 2,710,497. To be mentioned in that respect are, e.g., organotin compounds and organobismuth compounds. Many of them are known as hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide scavenger or are known for the slowdown of thermal degradation of poly vinyl chloride . Examples of such compounds are triphenylantimony, triphenylbismith and tetraphenyltin. A preferred class of stabilizing organometal compounds for use in combination with the organic compounds according to the present invention corresponds to the following formula R SnX whereinR is a hydrocarbon group, e.g. an alkyl group,X is one to three electronegative substituents e.g. oxygen in substituted form as in an alkoxy or in a carboxylate group, or is an electronegative sulphur substituent or a water repelling sulphur containing substituent linked through sulphur to the tin atom e.g. a thioether, a mercaptide or xanthate group, and m is 1, 2, or 3, excluding X being three, two or one halo gen atom s when m is 1, 2 or 3 respectively. Examples of such compounds are dibutyltin bis oxooctylthioglycolate , also called dibutyltin S,S bis n octylmercapto acetate andEMI10.1 R beingEMI10.2 described as stabilizing agent for polyvinyl chloride byD.H.Solomon, The Chemistry of Organic Film Formers, JohnWiley Sons, Inc. New York, p.175 to 177 1967 , and dibutyltin maleate, dibutyltin lauryl mercaptide, and di noctyl tin S,S bis iso octylmercapto acetate described by Xirk Othmer, Encyclopaedia of Chemical Technology, 2nd compl. revised edition, Vol. 21, p.390 1965 and inJ.Polymer Sci. Part A, Vol. 2 1964 1801 1813. A composition of matter of the present invention comprises halide containing phosphor particles, preferably inorganic halide containing phosphor particles, by admixture combined with a said organic stabilizing substance s optionally in a binder medium. In one process for preparing a composition of matter according to the present invention the halide containing phosphor particles are allowed to tome in intimate con tact with the organic stabilizing substance s in an organic liquid medium wherein said substance s dissolve and thus treated particles are separated out and dried. In one process for preparing a radiation conversion screen according to the present invention the halidecontaining phosphor particles are dispersed in an organic liquid medium in the presence of a dissolved binding agent s and at least one dissolved organic stabilizing substance. According to one embodiment the dispersing proceeds in a ball mill. Preferably the organic stabilizing substance s is are combined by admixture with the halide containing phosphor particles in a selected phosphor binder layer combination in an amount sufficient to maintain the fluorescent light emitting power of the layer in a moisture treatment as defined above for screen A at a level of at least 25 and preferably at a level of at least 75 of the level before said treatment. The amount of organic stabilizing substance or mixture of stabilizing substances suitable for a practically useful increase in stability against moisture of the applied halide containing phosphor particles can be determined by simple tests. Effective amounts of organic stabilizers, e.g. with regard to lanthanum oxybromide phosphors, are in the range of 0.05 to 10 g per 100 g of phosphor. More hygroscopic phosphors such as cesium iodide phosphors may be used in conjunction with higher amounts of stabilizer s . In the production of a radiation conversion screen according to the present invention the dispersion may be coated and dried on a permanent support, e.g. a cardboard or resin sheet, or coated on a temporary support to form a self supporting sheet later on. The solvent s used in the preparation of the coating composition is are normally evaporated under reduced pressure. An ultrasonic treatment can be applied to improve the packing density and to perform the de aeration of the phosphor binder combination. Before the optional application of a protective coating the phosphor binder layer may be calendered to improve the packing density i.e. the number of grams of phosphor per cm3 of dry coating . Self supporting screens of this invention can also be prepared by means of hot pressing , excluding the use of solvent s in the manufacture of the screens. To provide high X ray efficiency it is preferably that a minimum amount of binder be employed in the fluorescent layer. However, the less binding agent the more brittle the layer, so that a compromise has to be made. The thicker the fluorescent layer of a screen, the higher its intensification, but the image sharpness is decreased accordingly so that a balance between speed and definition has to be sought. Suitable binders for use in the preparation of the fluorescent layers are, e.g., a cellulose acetate butyrate, polyalkyl meth acrylates, e.g. polymethyl methacrylate, a polyvinyl n butyral, a copoly vinyl acetate vinyl chloride and a copoly acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or a copoly vinyl chloride vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol or mixtures thereof. The preferred binders are halogen free polymers or copolymers. Optionally, a light reflecting layer is provided between the fluorescent layer and its support to enhance the exposure of the silver halide emulsion material. To the phosphor containing layer a protective coating may be applied preferably having a thickness in the range of 5 to 25 Fm and bering composed of any film forming polymeric material that is phdDgraphically inert towards a silver halide emulsion layer. Polymeric materials suitable for that purpose include, e.g., cellulose derivatives e.g. cellulose nitrate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polyamides, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl chloride, silicone resins, poly acrylic ester and poly methacrylic ester resins, fluorinated hydrocarbon resins, and mixtures of the foregoing materials.Representative examples of various individual members of these binder materials include the following resinous materials poly methyl methacrylate , poly nbutyl methacrylate , poly isobutyl methacrylate , copolymers of n butyl methacrylate and isobutyl methacrylate, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and trifluorochloroethylene, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and tetrafluoroethylene, terpolymers of vinylidene fluoride, hexafluoropropylene and tetrafluoroethylene, and poly vinylidene fluoride . According to a special embodiment the outer face of the screen intended for contact with the photographic silver halide emulsion material contains a solid particulate material that has a static friction coefficient ji at room temperature 200C of less than 0.50 on steel. Antistatic substances may be applied to the screen to reduce the risk of electrical potential differences resulting in sparking. Bor example, the screens are treated with the ANTI STAT 6 spray, which leaves on odourless transparent antistatic deposit. ANTI STAT is a trade name of Braun Laboratories Div. Barrett ChemicalCo. Inc., Philadelphia, Pa., U.S.A. At least a part of the halide containing phosphor particles in the present composition of matter are preferably halide containing rare earth metal compounds, in which the host metal of the phosphor is a rare earth metal and the activator consists of one or more other rare earth metals. For example, these phosphors contain yttrium, gadolinium, lanthanum, or cerium as a host metal and at least one of the metals of the group of terbium, europium, dysprosium, thulium, samarium and ytterbium as activator metal. Preferred phosphors of this class correspond to one of the following general formulae Tb OX La 1 n Ubn OX wherein X is halogen such as e.g. chlorine, bromine, or fluorine, and n is from 0.006 to 0.0001, the halogen being present preferably in the range of between about the stoichiometric amount and about 2.5 percent differing therefrom or 1 w y OX Tb Yby wherein X is chlorine or bromine w is 0.0005 to 0.006 mole of the oxyhalide, and y is 0.00005 to 0.005 per mole of the oxyhalide.Cerium may replace lanthanum in an amount described in the U.E.Patent Specification 1,247,602 filed October 9, 1969 by General Electric and Co. The preparation of terbium activated lanthanum oxychloride and lanthanum oxybromide phosphors emitting visible light is described, e.g., in U.K.Patent Specification 1,247,602 mentioned hereinbefore, the French PatentSpecifications 2,021,398 and 2,021,399 both filed October 23, 1969 by General Electric and Co, and the publishedGerman Patent Applications DE OS 1,952,812 filed October 21, 1969 and 2,161,958 filed December 14, 1971 both byGeneral Electric and Co. Suitable lanthanum oxychloridefluoride phosphors are described in the published GermanPatent Application DE OS 2,329,396 filed June 8, 1973 by Siemens A.G. The preparation of lanthanum oxyhalides activated with terbium and ytterbium is described, e.g., in the published German Patent Application DOS 2,161,958 mentioned hereinbefore. Oxyhalides of lanthanum and gadolinium activated with thulium are described, e.g., for use in radiographic intensifier screens in the United States Patent Specification 3,795,814 of Jacob G.Rabatin, issued March 5, 1974. An ultraviolet emitting phosphor is barium fluoride chloride activated with europium II as described, e.g., in the French Patent Specification 2,185,667 filed May 23, 1973 by Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken N.V. According to an embodiment the present composition of matter is a composition wherein at least a part of said phosphor particles consists of said barium fluoride chloride. An X ray image intensifier screen employing rather hygroscopic sodium activated cesium iodide is described in the United States Patent Specification 3,836,784, already mentioned hereinbefore. According to an embodiment the present composition of matter is a composition wherein at least a part of the phosphor particles is sodium activated cesium iodde. The thickness of the supported fluorescent layer may vary within a broad range but is preferably in the range of 0.05 to 0.5mum. The coverage of the phosphors is, e.g., in the range of approximately 200 to 800 g sq.m and preferably approximately 300 to 600 g sq.m. The image sharpness obtainable with a fluorescent screen silver halide material system can be improved considerably by incorporating a fluorescent light absorbing dye, called screening dye herein, into the fluorescent screen material, e.g. into the fluorescent layer or into a layer adjacent thereto e.g. into a subjacent anti reflection layer. As the oblique radiation covers a large path in the screen material, it is attenuated by the screening dye or dyes to a greater extent than the radiation impinging normally. The term screening dye used herein includes dyestuffs i.e. coloured substances in molecularly divided form as well as pigments. Diffuse radiation reflecting from the support of the fluorescent screen material can be mainly attenuated in an anti reflection layer containing the screening dyes subjacent to the fluorescent layer. The screening dye need not to be removed from the fluorescent screen material and may therefore be any dye or pigment absorbing in the emission spectrum of the fluorescent substance s . Thus black substances such as carbon black particles of an average size of 0.15 to 0.60 pin incorporated in said anti reflection layer or the phosphor layer yield quite satisfactory results. The screening dye s is are preferably used in the fluorescent layer e.g. in an amount of at least 0.5 mg per sq.m. When used in the anti reflection layer, however, the amount of said dye s is not limited. A suitable screening dye for use in the fluorescent screens emitting in the green range 500 to 600 nm of the visible spectrum is, e.g., Neozapon Fire Red C.I. SolventRed 119 , an azochromium rhodamine complex. Other suitable screening dyes are C.I. Solvent Red 8, 25, 30, 31, 32, 35, 71, 98, 99, 100, 102, 109, 110, 118, 124 and 130. The non self supporting phosphor binder composition may be coated on a wide variety of supports, e.g. cardboard and plastic film, e.g. polyethylene terephthalate film.A support used in a fluorescent screen of the present invention may be coated with a subbing layer s to improve the adherence of the fluorescent coating thereto. Screens according to the present invention may be used in conjunction with light sensitive silver halide materials emulsion coated on one or both sides of the support. The following examples illustrate the present invention.Example 1Preparation of screen A A mixture consisting of 100 g of terbium activated lanthanum oxybromide phosphor, 0.5 g of lauric acid as stabilizing compound, 12.5 g of poly vinyl n butyral still containing 12 by weight of non acetalized vinyl alcohol units and having an average molecular weight of 50,000, and 48 g of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether were ball milled to a fineness of grind corresponding with 7 NS Hegman fineness of grind measured with the Hegman gauge as specified in ASTN Do 210. The dispersion obtained was filtered and after de aeration coated onto a barytacoated paper of 290 g per sq.m at a coverage of 500 g per sq.m to form said screen A. Preparation of screen B The X ray image intensifying screen B was manufactured as described for screen A with the difference that the stabilizing compound was omitted from the composition of the screen.Moisture treatment The moisture treatment of screens A and B proceeded by covering congruently the phosphor coating of each of the screens A and B with a wet circular piece of filter paper having a weight of 1.355 g in dry state, a diameter of 15 cm, and a water content of 3.100 g.Subsequently, the covered screens A and B were separately packed air tight in a polyethylene bag and kept at 600C for 64 h in a ventilated cabinet. The screens A and B were removed then from the bag and after removal of the filter paper dried in the air for 30 min at 800C. X ry exoosure and develoPment The thus moisture treated screens A and B and a screen B1 which was like screen B but was untreated with moisture, were exposed to X rays in contact with a CURIXRP1 film Curix is a trade mark of the Applicant for a medical X ray film . The exposure was effected to such a degree that after development for 23 s at 350C in Agfa Gevaert s hardening developer G 138 containing hydroquinone and 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidinone as developing agents and glutaraldehyde as a hardener the area of the silver halide material exposed in contact with the untreated screen B1 showed a transmission spectral density of 1.82 above fog.After gradually increasing exposures with screen B1 of the above film material and said development of the film as described a silver image with a gamma gamma of 3 is obtained. The transmission spectral densities obtained with the moisture treated screens tA and B were 1.76 and zero above fog respectively. The actual loss in fluorescence power of screen A was computed as follows A density AD 1.82 1.76 0.06 log exposure exposure log E 0.06 log exposure log E D 0.06 0.02 antilog 0.02 1.05 1 1.05 0.95 100 95 5 . A usable result was also obtained by replacing lauric acid by a same amount of 1 n dodecylamine.Example 2Preparation of screen I 5 g of a 40 by weight solution in toluene of ELVACITE 2044 ELVACITE 2044 is a trade name of E.I. du Pont de Nemours Co. Inc. , Wilmington, Del., U.S.A., for a poly n butyl methacrylate 100 g of LaOBr 0.02 Tb 0.0005 Yb phosphor particles prepared according to published German Patent Specifi cation 2,161,958, 0.5 g of the stabilizing compound laurylmercaptane, and 251.2 g of toluene were ball milled for 4 h, whereupon a further amount of 10.5 g of ELWACITE 2044 trade name was added and ball milling was continued up to a Hegman fineness of grind of 7 NS average phosphor particle size 7 pm measured with the Hegman gauge as specified in ASTN D1210. The dispersion obtained was coated at a coverage of 500 g per sq.m of phosphor on a subbed polyethylene terephthalate support and dried.Preparation of screen II Screen II was prepared in the same way as described for screen I with the difference, however, that the stabilizing compound was omitted from the composition.Moisture treatment Circular pieces of screen I and screen II each of them having a diameter of 15 cm were separately covered congruently with a wet circular piece of filter paper having a weight of 1.355 g in dry state, a diameter of 15 cm, and a water content of 3.100 g. Each of the thus covered screens was packed air tight separately in a polyethylene bag and kept at 600C in a ventilated cabinet for 64 h. Subsequently, the covered screens were removed from the polyethylene bag and the pieces of screens I and II after separation from the filter paper were dried in the air for 30 min at 800C. X ry exposure and development The moisture treated screens I and II and an untreated screen II were exposed to X rays in contact with a CURIX trade mark RP1 film. The exposure was effected to such a degree that after development for 23 s at 350C in Agfa Gevaert s hardening developer G 138 containing hydroquinone and 1 phenyl 3 pyrazolidinone as developing agents and glutaraldehyde as a hardener the area of the silver halide material exposed in contact with the untreated screen II showed a transmission spectral density of 1.25 above fog. Computed from the difference in density obtained with the moisture treated screen I and non moisturetreated screen II the actual loss in fluorescence power of screen I was 7.9 .Example 3Preparation of screen P A mixture consisting of 100 g of terbium activated lanthanum oxybromide phosphor, 0.5 g of lauryl alcohol as stabilizing compound, 12.5 g of poly vinyl n butyral still containing 12 by weight of non acetalized vinyl alcohol units and having an average molecular weight of 50,000 and 48 g of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether were ball milled to 7 NS Hegman fineness of grind measured with the Hegman gauge as specified in ASTN D1210. The dispersion obtained was filtered and after de aeration coated onto a baryta coated paper of 290 g per sq.m at a coverage of 150 g of phosphor per sq.m to form screen P. The phosphor layer was overcoated with a protective coating from a 7.5 solution in ethylene glycol monomethyl ether of cellulose acetate butyrate having a degree of substitution DS of acetyl 1.31 and a DS of butyryl of 1.51. The dried protective coating had a coating weight of 10 g per sq.m.Preparation of screen Q The X ray image intensifying screen Q was manufactured as described for screen P with the difference that the stabilizing compound was omitted from the composition of the screen. Preparation of screen R The X ray image intensifying screen R was manufactured as described for screen P with the difference that before coating the oxybromide phosphor dispersion was mixed with a calcium tungstate phosphor dispersion prepared as described for the lanthanum oxybromide phosphor dispersion of screen P with the only difference that the oxybromide phosphor was replaced by a same amount of calcium tungstate. The calcium tungstate phosphor dispersion was added in an amount such that the venal dispersion contained the oxybromide phosphor and calcium tungstate phosphor in a ratio of 1 2. The phosphor mixture dispersion was coated on the same support as described for screen P at a phosphor mixture coverage of 150 g of terbium activated lanthanum oxybromide phosphor and 300 g of calcium tungstate per sq.m. Moisture treatment The moisture treatment of screens P, Q and R proceeded by incubation in a cabinet having inside an atmosphere of 85 relative humidity at 200C. Said incubation treatment was effected for a period of 2 weeks. After that period the fluorescence power of screen Q was completely lost and screen P showed randomly distributed spots and small craters. Screen R did not show any trace of deterioration. When screens P and R were X ray exposed in contact with separate strips of the same silver halide emulsion film the developed film strip exposed in combination with screen P showed more than 100 white spots per sq.dm whereas the developed film strip which was exposed in contact with screen R did not show any spots at all and was evenly blackened. The ratio of the intensification factors of screens P and R was 1 1.
