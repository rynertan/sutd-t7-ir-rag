# BROAD SPECTRUM VACCINE AGAINST GONORRHEA

## Abstract
Vaccines comprising peptide sequences corresponding to immunorecessive determinants in gonorrhea pilus protein are disclosed. The vaccines are effective in protecting human sub jects against infection by a wide range of gonorrhea strains by raising antibodies which interfere with the colonization of the epithelium by the infecting bacteria or which enhance phago cytosis.
