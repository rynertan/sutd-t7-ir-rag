# Security equipment for providing indication of removal of objects from monitored locations.

## Abstract
A photocell 42 is placed beneath an object at each loca tion, so that if the object is removed the illumination of the corresponding photocell will increase, and hence its electrical conductance, thus providing an indication of removal. The photocells at several locations are connected in a parallel circuit with each other, and a voltage supply source is con nected to the parallel circuit through a common current sensing resistance 82,132 so that if an object is removed from any location a voltage drop is detected across the com mon current sensing resistance. Each branch circuit at each location is provided with its own current sensing series resis tor 46 , and a separate conductor is run from each such series resistor to a central control. Indicators 66 corresponding to each location are provided so that upon removal of the object from any location, the corresponding indicator will thereby be activated.
