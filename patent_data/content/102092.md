# Artificial stone or filler for the construction industry based on fly ash.

## Abstract
The manufacture of building materials and additional materials from the components fly ash and harbour silt whereby the silt serves as the binder of fly ash. After drying and heating, the result is a nonsolvable product which might be applied as building stone, aggregate or filter. The manufacturing of building materials and additional materials from the components fly ash and harbour silt, or fly ash and silt separately. When adding sodium hydroxide NA.OH and alumi nium powder, a foam reaction is caused and after being dried and heated this results in a non dissoluble product which may find its application as a light weight building stone, an aggregate or a filter.

## Claims
Claims 1. The manufacturing of building materials and additional materials from the components fly ash and harboursilt where by the silt serves as the binder of fly ash. After drying and heating the result is a nonsolvable product which might be applied as building stone or additional material. 2. The manufacturing of building materials and additional materials from the components fly ash and harboursilt, or fly ash and silt separately. When adding sodium hydroxide NA.OH and aluminium powder a foam reaction is caused and after being dried and heated this results in a non solvable product which may find its application as a light weight building stone or an additional material.

## Description
Fly ash stone.The invention concerns the manufacturing of a product being turned into stone. It comes from fly ash by which harbour silt, possibly together with silt, polluted with heavy metals, serves as binder.The invention deals especially with the manufacturing of a building stone or a stone for general use, which is broken into the desired gradation, the components being fly ash and harbour silt. It might be applicable in roadconstruction as a foundation material or as an additional material splitt in bitumen, in concrete construction as a substitute for gravel or other alternative volumeincreasing additional materials.Fly ash is a product which comes from coal fired power stations and which is separated from combustion gasses by gaspurificationapparatus. The aluminium and silicon, which fly ash mainly consists of, give a glassy appearance to it.Harbour silt consists of particles which are suspended in water and eventually settle to the bottom of harbours.The process proceeds upon the following principles 10 parts of fly ash and 1, 2, 3 or, if desirable more parts of silt are taken.These components are thoroughly mixed and at choice subsequently made mouldable by adding water, after which this substance is poured into the desired mould, is pressed or stamped, then is dried and subsequently baked in temperatures ranging from 850 to 12500 centigrade.After baking time the stone can be left in its shape or it can be broken into a desired grain size which results in for instance a sort of split, gravel or foundation ma terial. A mixture of fly ash and silt is taken or fly ash and silt are taken separately after which sodium hydroxide NA.OH and aluminium powder are added. These components are thoroughly mixed and the combination of water1 aluminium powder and sodium hydroxide NA.0H cause a foam reaction.Then the mixture is poured or put into the desired mould, dried and baked in temperatures up to 12500 centigrade.After baking time the product can be kept in its existing shape or it can be broken into a desired grain size.In this way an ultra light building stone or an ultralight additional material can be obtained.In case only fly ash is used the sodium hydroxide NA.OH serves as binder as well.
