# A process of regenerating an ammoniacal etching solution.

## Abstract
A process is described for regenerating a spent ammoniacal etching solution containing copper values. The process comprises extracting copper from the spent etching solution by means of an organic solution containing a reagent which is capable of selectively extracting copper ions from the spent etching solution. The process also comprises extracting copper from the washing water originating from the etching process.
