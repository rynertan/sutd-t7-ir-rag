# Propylene copolymer composition for heat sealable plastics laminate.

## Abstract
A crystalline random propylene copolymer composition which may be provided on at least one surface of a crystalline polypropylene substrate layer to form a heat sealable laminate, comprises i a crystalline random prop ylene copolymer comprising 99 to 85 mole of propylene and 1 to 15 mole of an alpha olefin other than propylene and ii a random 1 butene copolymer comprising ethylene and 1 butene, the weight ratio of the copolymer i to the copolymer ii being from 5 95 to 90 10 and said random 1 butene copolymer ii satisfying the following conditions A it comprises from 1 to 50 mole of the ethylene component and from 99 to 50 mole of the 1 butene component, B it has an intrinsic viscosity η , measured in decalin at 135 C, of from 0.5 to 6 dl g, C it has a melting point Tm , measured by a differential scanning colorimeter, of from 30 to 130 C, D it has a crystallinity, measured by X ray diffractomet ry, of from 1 to 60 , E the amount W₁ in by weight of that portion of it which is soluble in boiling methyl acetate is not more than 2 , and F the amount W₂ in by weight of that portion of it which is soluble in a 1 1 by volume mixture of acetone and n decane at 10 C is 5 η ¹² or less.
