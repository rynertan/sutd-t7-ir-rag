# Apparatus for and methods of monitoring partial discharge in high voltage electrical equipment.

## Abstract
In apparatus for continuously monitoring partial dis charge in high voltage electrical equipment thereby to give advance warning of impending breakdown of solid insulated components e.g. capacitors 11 to 16 , means are provided to distinguish electrical signals indicative of partial discharge from those resulting from noise or external transients. Current pulses in the various partial discharge paths are detected by detectors 21 to 26 , and by means of solid state circuitry 40, 41 their relative polarities are compared and an appropriate signal is made according to the comparison.
