## Description
METHOD FOR ELIMINATING EDGE LIFT UP DURING IEERE OXIDATION OF A POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON MEMBER The present invention relates to a method for producing a thermal oxide coating on a member of polycrystalline silicon on an insulating substrate without resultant lift up of the edges of the polycrystalline silicon member. Patterned lines of polycrystalline silicon on an insulating substrate are used in integrated circuit devices as the gates of the MOS Metal Oxide Semiconductor transistors and as conductive lines. When such lines of polycrystalline silicon are subsequently thermally oxidized to provide electrical isolation of the lines from other members of an integrated circuit, the oxidation of the polycrystalline silicon member proceeds at a more rapid rate at the interface between the polycrystalline silicon member and the insulating substrate, thereby producing a lift up of the member of polycrystalline silicon at the edges thereof and forming a reentrant profile in the resultant silicon dioxide coating.Such a reentrant profile makes it difficult to provide continuity in conductive lines extending over the reentrant profile of silicon dioxide. When members of polycrystalline silicon so formed are used as gates in MOS transistors, lift up of the edges of the polycrystalline silicon semiconductor member causes a shift in gate threshold voltage due to variations in gate oxide thickness.This problem is particularly acute in devices of small dimensions. lt is an object of the present invention to provide a thermal oxide on members of polycrystalline silicon on insulated substrates without causing lift up of the edges of the members of polycrystalline silicon. In accordance with the present invention, in a process for providing a member of polycrystalline silicon semiconductor material on an insulating substrate with a layer of silicon dioxide covering the exposed portions of the member by oxidizing a portion of the member of polycrystalline silicon semiconductor material, there is provided the step of depositing a layer of polycrystalline silicon on the polycrystalline silicon semiconductor member and on the insulating substrate and thereafter oxidizing the layer of polycrystalline silicon semiconductor material into silicon dioxide. The novel features which are believed to be characteristic of the present invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention itself, both as to its organization and method of operation, together with further objects and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 shows a cross section of a prior art structure formed by prior art methods. Figures 2A 2C show cross sections of structures representing successive steps in accordance with the method of the present invention. Reference is now made to Figure 1 which shows a cross sectional view of a prior art structure 10 made by the prior art process. Figure 1 shows a substrate 11 of silicon semiconductor material having a major surface 12 on which was grown a layer of silicon dioxide 13. A layer of polycrystalline silicon 0.65 microns thick was deposited on the surface of the layer of silicon dioxide, doped to saturation with phosphorus in a conventional process using vapors of phosphorus oxychloride PO C13 and patterned by conventional photolithographic masking and etching techniques to forme a conductive member 14. Thereafter, the conductive member was thermally oxidized at 900 0C in dry oxygen for 20 hours to produce a layer 15 of silicon dioxide thereon approximately 2600 Angstroms thick.In the oxidation process, at the interface between the layer of silicon dioxide and the patterned polysilicon conductor, the deep penetratration of oxygen causes oxide formation on the underside of the polycrystalline silicon member and hence produces an uplifting of the edges of the polycrystalline silicon conductor as shown. Reference is now made to Figures 2A 2C which show various steps in the process for providing a film or coating of silicon dioxide over a member of polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention.Figure 2A shows a substrate 21 of silicon semiconductor material having a major surface 22 parallel to the 100 crystallographic plane of the silicon. A layer 23 of silicon dioxide 1 micron thick was thermally grown on the major surface 22. Thereafter, a layer 24 of polycrystalline semiconductor material was deposited by standard chemical vapor deposition techniques, for example by pyrolytic decomposition of silane, to form a layer of 0.65 microns thick. The layer of polycrystalline silicon was doped to saturation with phosphorus in a conventional process using phosphorus oxychloride PO Cl3 to lower the resistivity thereof. Thereafter, the polycrystalline silicon layer was patterned using conventional photolithographic masking and etching techniques to form conductors 24.Next, the patterned polycrystalline member 24 was coated with a layer 25 of low pressure chemically vapor deposited polycrystalline silicon 750 Angstroms thick, as shown in Figure 2B.Thereafter, the substrate with the deposited polycrystalline layer was thermally oxidized at 900 0C in dry oxygen for 20 hours to oxidize the second layer 25 of polycrystalline silicon into a coating 26 of silicon dioxide, as shown in Figure 2C. In this process, the layer 25 of polycrystalline silicon is completely oxidized and a top portion of the polycrystalline silicon member 24 is oxidized forming a coating over the polycrystalline member 24 approximately 2600 Angstroms thick and over the exposed portions of the layer of silicon dioxide approximately 1500 Angstroms thick with no uplifting of the edges of the polycrystalline silicon member 24. In order to compare the effectiveness of the process of the present invention with the process in which the overlying layer of polycrystalline silicon is not used, an identical sample of a conductor of polycrystralline silicon on a substrate of silicon dioxide was oxidized in the Identical way, however, without providing a layer of polycrystalline silicon over the polycrystalline silicon member. In this case, thermal oxidation was performed at 900 0C. in dry oxygen for 20 hours, and resulted in a coating of dioxide 2600 Angstroms thick in the patterned polycrystalline silicon member 24. An edge uplift of approximately 2000 Angstroms was observed. In applicants process no edge uplift was observed. A feature of the present invention is that layer 25 of polycrystalline silicon is deposited undoped but yet picks up phosphorus from doped polycrystalline silicon member 24 to form a layer 26 of silicon dioxide 2600 Angstroms thick on the member 24. Normal undoped polycrystalline silicon would grow 1470 Angstroms of oxide during this oxidation time. Thus, the process of the present invention is not only useful in eliminating edge lift up but also at the same time produces a thicker overlying layer of silicon dioxide as desired in integrated circuit devices. While, in the example described above, the polycrystalline silicon member was formed on an insulating substrate of silicon dioxide, it will be understood that other insulating substrates, such as silicon nitride may be used. While the invention has been described in a specific embodiment, it will be understood that modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, and it is intended by the appended claims to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
