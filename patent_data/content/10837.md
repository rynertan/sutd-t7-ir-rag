## Abstract
Pilferproof closure and container assembled with such closure. A tamper proof cap 35 and neck 12 assembly made of stretchable plastics material in which the neck 12 has portions 14, 21 fitted within and about a short metal neck portion 3 of a container 5 which serves as a rigidifying back up for the plastic neck and for a locking shoulder 13 on the neck 12 to provide a deflection resistant structure and thereby prevent a tamper indicating ring 52 connected to the cap 35 from slipping off the shoulder 13 without tearing upon linitial unthreading of the cap 35 . This rigidified structure also facilitates appli cation of the tamper indicating ring 52 during initial threading of the cap 35 onto the threaded neck 12 at which time the ring 52 is stretched over the shoulder 13 by a capper bead which engages force transmitting posts 58 integral with the ring 52 for forcing the ring over the locking shoulder, the band 52 being stretched between the posts 58 and extending beneath the shoulder 13 as chordal segments.
