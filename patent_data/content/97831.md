# Optical projection systems and methods of producing optical images.

## Abstract
Semiconductor fabrication using optical proection apparatus is enhanced in an arrangement having means for producing exposures tailored to the patterns on the conven tional photo mask. A predetermined correction photo mask capable of producing different exposure levels according to the original mask pattern is superimposed with the original mask on the semiconductor wafer by sequential double exposure using an additional mask change and alignment. The drawings show an original mask pattern and a correction mask pattern. A better arrangement provides two beams simul taneously illuminating the two masks the two beams are recombined with a high quality beam splitter arrangement before reaching the imaging lens. The two masks only have to be aligned to each other once. Afterwards, the wafer is exposed regularly. Therefore, an uncorrected image has the lowest threshold for an isolated opening, medium threshold for equal lines and spaces, high threshold for an isolated opaque line. After the correction scheme, all thresholds are made equal. The correction mask is made of grainless dyes of different light transmission or of one semitransparent subst ance of different thickness, such as thin layers of iron oxide, chromium or silicon. Standard lithographic patterning tech niques, such as substractive etching, lift off or plating are used to fabricate the correction mask.
