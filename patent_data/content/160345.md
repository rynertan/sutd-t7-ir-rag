# PRE PATTERNED DEVICE SUBSTRATE DEVICE ATTACH ADHESIVE TRANSFER SYSTEM

## Abstract
A pre patterned device substrate device attach transfer tape is described which allows a one step mounting of adhesive patterns on a device substrate in the desired configuration for later mount of surface mounted devices e.g., semiconductor dies thereon. The tape product con tains the adhesive pattern in a mirror image to that desired on the exposed surface of the device substrate. The product of the present invention is utilized by bringing the tape product into contact with the device substrate so that the adhesive on the carrier film bonds to the desired surface of the device substrate thereby bringing the adhesive patterns into the desired configuration desired on the device subs trate. The use of pressure and, possibly, heat preferentially bonds the adhesive to the device substrate and allows for later stripping of the support film from the support film adhesive device substrate composite. This step leaves be hind the desired adhesive configuration on the device substrate and allows for later bonding of appropriate mounted devices to the device substrate.
