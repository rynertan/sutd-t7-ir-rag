# Height control valve for an agricultural implement.

## Abstract
A hydraulic actuator 26 raises and lowers an implement in response to a height sensor acting through a spring 44 against one end of the spool of a four position spool valve 48 . The other end of the spool is acted upon by a spring 78 . At the correct height the spool assumes neutral position A . Low and high deviations in height shift the spool to a slow raise position B and a slow lower position C respectively which provide for raising and lowering at a rate which is slow by virtue of a flow restriction 118 . When the implement is raised to a transport position and the spring 44 is untensioned, the valve assumes a position D in which the flow restriction 118 is bypassed for rapid lowering of the implement. Lowering is prevented by a check valve 96 until a pressure line 54 to the valve is pressurized from a selector valve 50 . Pressure in a branch line 107 then opens the check valve. The selector valve 50 has a fast raise position in which it reverses the connections to the spool valve. The pressure in what is normally the return line 56 is communicated by a branch line 126 to the same end of the spool as that acted upon by the spring 78 whereby the spool is forced into position D in which the slow restriction 118 is bypassed and the reversed connection raises the implement rapidly.
