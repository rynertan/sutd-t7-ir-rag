# Apparatus and method for arranging semiconductor pellets.

## Abstract
An apparatus transposes a matrix of semiconductor pellets mounted on a first adhesive tape A to a second adhesive tape B in such a manner that the respective pellet rows are arranged spaced from the adjacent pellet rows. It has pellet supporting means 34 having an inclined plane 34C and apical plane. The first adhesive tape A bearing the matrix is carried stepwise along the inclined plane 34C toward the apical plane to successively bring the respective rows of the matrix to the apical plane. Above the apical plane, a second adhesive tape B is carried in a direction intersecting the pellet columns at right angles with the adhesive plane thereof facing the matrix. When each row mounted on the first tape A is on the apical plane, the second tape B is pressed against the row. Each time one pellet row is transposed to the second tape B , the pellet supporting means is shifted in a direction intersecting the pellet columns at right angles.
