# DENSE PHASE PUMP

## Abstract
An improved dense phase pump for transporting parti culate matter in a gaseous media is disclosed comprising a chamber having an inlet port for particulate matter, a conduit within the reservoir connecting an outlet port for the mixture of particulate matter and gaseous media with a collecting means, an inlet port for the gaseous media and a double dribble plate assembly positioned between the gas inlet port and the collecting means. The double dribble plate assembly comprises at least two plates each having openings there through which are out of registry with one another, the plates being spaced apart a sufficient distance whereby gas passing through the holes in one plate may pass through the holes in the second plate into the chamber to mix with the particulate matter and to sweep the mixture of particulate matter and gas out of the chamber through the collecting means.
