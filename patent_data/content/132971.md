# PRODUCTION OF CHLORINATED HYDROCARBONS

## Abstract
An oxychlorination process for chlorinated hydrocarbons in which at least part of the feedstock hydrogen chloride is provided by combustion of chlorine containing organic residues in an oxygen rich flame, the combusted gases being transferred from the combustion chamber to the oxychlorina tion reaction above the dewpoint of their water content, thus avoiding the need for condensing and reheating. Also a com bustion chamber therefor with novel cooler design to give the required flame and temperature control, and oxychlorination apparatus comprising this chamber.
