# TUNER.

## Abstract
When one power supply voltage is applied as a band switching voltage from single throw triple pole switch to selectively switch between a VHF low band, VHF high band and a UHF band in a tuner unit used for a television receiver or the like, the second contact of the switch for selecting the VHF high band is connected through a second switching diode to the connecting point of a first switching diode for switching the tuning coil of a VHF input tuning circuit and a high frequency grounding capacitor, and a third contact of the switch for selecting the UHF band is connected through a third switching diode, and the first switching diode conducts even when receiving the UHF band. Thus, it can eliminate a harmonic wave of the VHF signal caused by the first switching diode from the VHF input circuit, thereby eliminating noise on the screen and faults when setting another band.
