# Silane crosslinkable copolymer compositions.

## Abstract
A silane crosslinkable copolymer composition compris es A 100 parts by weight of a copolymer prepared by radically polymerizing a polymerizable monomeric mixture consisting essentially of ethylene and an ethylenically un saturated silane compound having a hydrolyzable organic group under a high pressure, and containing said silane compound in an amount of from 0.1 to 5 wt B from 0.001 to 10 parts by weight of a silanol condensation catalyst and C from 0.01 to 5 parts by weight of a silane compound having a hydrolyzable organic group. Use of the compositions prevents condensation reaction in the extruder during the initial stage of extrusion, and consequent surface unevenness.
