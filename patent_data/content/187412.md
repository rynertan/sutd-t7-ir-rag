## Description
This invention relates to a monochromatic cathode ray tube having a faceplate arrangement including a faceplate consisting essentially of a transparent material, an internal screen consisting essentially of a light scattering luminescent material for emitting light radiation in a band encompassing a predetermined wavelength λ Conventional cathode ray tube display systems use either a single display tube of three monochromatic projection tubes. The display tube produces a viewable image at its faceplate. The projection tubes simultaneously project respective red, green and blue images onto a projection screen where they collectively form a viewable polychromatic image. In either type of system, the image contrast is adversely affected by halo. This is an undesirable ring or series of rings surrounding the luminescent image of the tube s scanning electron beam. U.S. Patent 4,310,784 to Anthon et al discloses a cathode ray tube faceplate construction for suppressing halo. The construction consists of a clear glass faceplate having an anti reflection coating on its outside surface and an angle sensitive thin film interference coating between its inside surface and a phosphor screen. The outside antireflection coating is provided to reduce reflection back into the faceplate of luminescent light rays incident thereto at small angles, thereby suppressing a central portion of halo surrounding a luminescent spot. The inside interference coating is provided to reflect luminescent light rays incident thereto at large angles, thereby suppressing a ringlike outer portion of the halo surrounding the central portion. It is an object of the invention to improve the quality of images produced by monochromatic cathode ray tubes of the above mentioned type. Hereto such a monochromatic cathode ray tube is characterized in that the optical filter includes The invention is based on the insight that the image quality can be improved by providing a monochromatic cathode ray tube with a faceplate arrangement including optical filter means which blocks substantially all visually perceptible light radiation incident at angles above ϑ In principle, an inside interference coating should, by itself, effectively decrease halo and increase brightness. Such a coating should reflect back into the powdered luminescent screen all rays which would otherwise contribute to halo. Some of these reflected rays would be redirected toward the faceplate, increasing image brightness. The coating should operate as a filter having a sharp cutoff, reflecting all rays which significantly contribute to halo i.e. rays emitted at angles larger than a predetermined angle ϑ Anthon s interference filter, however, produces a gradual increase in reflectivity with angle, reaching only about 60 reflectivity for rays incident at 45 while producing substantial reflectivity even for rays incident at angles between 0 and 30 . The filter in accordance with the invention includes a first portion adjacent the screen and a second portion adjacent the faceplate. The first portion comprising a multilayer interference edge filter having a cutoff wavelength equal to λ 0 for light rays received from the screen which are perpendicular to the edge filter, and having a cutoff wavelength equal to λ 0 for light rays received from the screen which are incident to the edge filter at angles greater than ϑ The invention will now by way of example be described in greater detail with reference to a drawing in which Figure 1 is a sectional view of one end of a cathode ray tube faceplate and a lens in a projection system employing a prior art cathode ray tube Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the optical characteristics of a cathode ray tube faceplate in accordance with the invention and Figure 3 is a sectional view of one end of a cathode ray tube faceplate arrangement in accordance with the invention. The causes of halo and the angle dependence of image brightness can be seen by referring to Figure 1, which illustrates a typical prior art faceplate arrangement 10 of a projection tube spaced from a focusing lens 12, both shown in cross section. The lens 12 magnifies the image formed by light rays received from the faceplate arrangement 10, and projects the image into a relatively large reflective or transmissive projection screen not shown . The arrangement 10 includes a glass faceplate 14, a powdered luminescent screen 16 deposited onto the faceplate, and a reflective layer 18 of an electrically conductive material such as aluminium. Typical thicknesses for the faceplate, the luminescent screen, and the reflective layer are 10 millimeters, 50 microns and 0.1 microns, respectively. The layer 18 is provided to collect excited electrons from the screen and to reflect toward the faceplate backwardly directed light rays passing through the screen, thereby increasing the amount of light reaching the lens 12. As is subsequently explained, however, the layer 18 not only increases the amount of useful light reaching the lens 12, but also increases light contributing the halo. Although Figure 1 is not drawn to scale, it demonstrates how light rays emitted by the luminescent screen are transmitted through the faceplate arrangement 10. When an electron beam 20 excites the luminescent screen 16 at a spot such as that centered on point 22, a multiplicity of light rays are emitted at different angles. All angles are measured relative to a line 24 originating at the point 22 and passing perpendicularly through a faceplate screen interface 26 and a faceplate air interface 28. All light rays emitted toward the interface 26 are at least partly reflected back into the powdered luminescent screen 16, as rays I The light rays emitted from point 22 which pass through the faceplate screen interface 26 reach the faceplate air interface 28 at the front of the tube. At least a portion I Figure 2 illustrates both the emission characteristics of a typical luminescent screen and the desired transmittance of the interference edge filter forming the first portion of a filter means in accordance with the invention. The solid lines illustrate the spectral distribution of a high brightness terbium doped P44 phosphor material which emits visible light in four distinct bands, including a primary green emission band and three spurious emission bands. The spurious emission bands include a blue sideband to the left of the primary emission band, and orange and red sidebands to the right. The primary emission band has its peak intensity at 544 nanometers λ The dashed dotted lines illustrate the desired transmittance characteristics of the edge filter. As is illustrated by the dashed line, the edge filter is designed to have a cutoff wavelength of λ 0 for light rays incident to the filter at 900 . As is illustrated by the dotted line, the edge filter is designed to have a cutoff wavelength of λ 0 for light rays incident to the filter at ϑ The ideal transmittance characteristics illustrated by the dashed dotted lines in Figure 2 cannot be obtained by use of the edge filter alone, but they can be closely approximated by the addition of the multilayer matching filter forming the second portion of the filter means. The matching filter reduces ripple in the transmittance characteristics, which is the major cause of deviation from the illustrated characteristics. This reduction is accomplished by providing a combination of layers having an equivalent admittance which matches the admittance of the edge filter to that of the faceplate material which serves as the supporting substrate for the compound filter. Suitable matching filters are described in the previously mentioned text by Macleod on pages 128 143. It should be noted that the above described filter is highly transmissive for light in the spurious blue sideband. This light is not noticeable, however, because of the relatively low energy content of the sideband in comparison to that of the primary green band, and because of the low acuity of the human eye for blue light in comparison to green light. For filters designed to be used with many phosphor materials, the spurious sidebands need not be con . sidered, either because they fall in the rejection band or because no sidebands visible to the human eye are produced. Red light producing europium doped materials and blue light producing thulium doped materials are examples of phosphor materials which produce no visible sidebands. Figure 3 illustrates in cross section an embodiment of a faceplate arrangement including an optical filter means having the above described cutoff wavelengths at λ 0 for ϑ ϑ The compound optical filter 39 includes a first portion 40 forming the interference edge filter and a second portion 42 forming the matching filter. The edge filter 40 includes a first layer adjacent the screen 36, an odd number m of intermediate layers, and a final layer adjacent the matching filter 42. The first layer has a refractive index n₂ and a thickness t₂ ₂. The m intermediate layers have alternate refractive indices and thicknesses n₁ and t₁, n₂ and t₂, respectively. The final layer of the edge filter 40 has the refractive index n₂, and the thickness t₂ 2. The matching filter 42 has three layers, including a first layer having a thickness t₃ 2 which is adjacent the final layer of the edge filter. These two layers are indistinguishable from each other, as is indicated in Figure 3 by a dashed line, because both layers are formed from the same material having the refractive index n₂. The second layer of the matching filter has the refractive index n₁ and a thickness t₄. The final layer of the matching filter is adjacent the faceplate 34 and has the refractive index n₂, and the thickness t₃ 2. The layers in the edge filter and the matching filter also have the following relationships It has been found that the performance of the edge filter can be optimized by setting the product n₁t₁ 1 4 of the wavelength λ A particularly effective faceplate arrangement approximating the transmittance characteristics illustrated in Figure 2 is produced for a green emitting λ A faceplate arrangement having the above described layer materials and thicknesses, and 15 intermediate layers, closely approaches the transmittance characteristics illustrated in Figure 2 for ϑ Although the invention has been described with reference to a projection tube embodiment having a particular phosphor material, it may be easily adapted for use with other types of cathode ray tube, such as display tube, and with other phosphor materials. Different materials may also be used to form the filter means such as as zinc sulfide N 2.30 , tantalum oxide n 2.05 2.10 and magnesium fluoride n 1.38 .
