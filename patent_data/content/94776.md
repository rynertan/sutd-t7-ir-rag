# Novel process for the preparation of biotin.

## Abstract
A novel process is described for preparation of biotin comprising preparation of substituted 3H, 5H imidazo 1, 5c tetrahydro thiazoles by contacting the boron trifluoride adduct of an appropriate thiazoline with the metallic deriva tive of an ester enolate, reducing the ester, hydrolyzing the thiazolidine moiety and hydrolyzing or oxidizing the resul tant compound. Intermediates obtained in the preparation of biotin by the above process and alternate procedures for preparing said intermediates are also presented. A novel process for preparation of d biotin is also given.
