# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING WHEN A PISTON IS AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION

## Abstract
The apparatus is used to determine an expected time for a piston to be positioned at a desired location within a cylinder of an internal combustion engine. The desired location can be related to the position of the crank arm which is connected to the piston and is needed for the initiation of an order from an engine control system to inject fuel into the cylinder, ignite fuel within the cylinder or the like. The apparatus includes a sensing element fixidly mounted relative to the cylinder for producing a first electrical signal when the piston is at a reference location prior to reaching an end location and for producing a second electrical signal when the piston is at the reference location after leaving the end location. The engine control system records the times of the electrical signals and calculates a time differential therebetween. The engine control system also calculates a total time interval of a cycle by determining an elapsed time between the piston being at the reference location during the cycle and being at the reference location during an immedi ately preceding cycle. An anticipated travel time interval is calculated as a product of the total time interval multiplied by the angle of rotation of the crank arm from the end position divided by a total angle of rotation of 360 degrees for a cycle. The engine control system algebraically adds one half of the time differential and the anticipated travel time interval to the time of the first or the second electrical signal.
