# Method of logging fluid flow rate, water fraction, and or water salinity.

## Abstract
A well logging method which is capable of providing an in dication of salinity and water fraction of the production fluid of a borehole uses a conventional gamma ray logging system that detects gamma rays produced by isotopes created from neu tron activation of oxygen, sodium, and chlorine present in the production fluid. A logging sonde is passed twice through a portion of interest in the borehole at a different logging speed on each pass. The fluid velocity relative to the sonde may be de termined using these two logging speeds and a displacement distance which reflects the time required for a detector 36, 46 associated with the sonde to reach fluid activated by neutrons produced by the sonde. From these measurements and knowl edge of the flow cross section and parameters of the sonde, the fraction of water in the production fluid and the salinity of the water may be determined for each portion of interest of the borehole.
