# METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR IMPARTING FRAGRANT ODOR TO PRODUCT CONTAINER

## Abstract
A method is presented for using scented oils to provide odor to a container of a product having a constituent incompat ible with the scented oils. An aqueous emulsion which compri ses from about 4 to about 70 of a water emulsifiable or water soluble polymer, from about 5 to about 80 of scen ted oils, and from about 6 to about 80 of water is prepared. The aqueous emulsion is dried whereby the scented oils are entrapped within the matrix of the polymer. The polymer matrix is included in the container with the product whereby the scented oils are protected by the polymer matrix from de gradation by the incompatible constituent and diffuse from the polymer matrix over a period of time.
