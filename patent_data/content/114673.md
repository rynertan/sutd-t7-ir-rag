## Description
Acceleration control device for users with lower limbs physical disabilities The present invention relates to an acceleration control device to be used in motorcars intended for people deprived of the use of the lower limbs. The device, whose encumbrance is minimum, is mounted on the motorcar steering wheel, and may be operated in any driving situations, even with one hand only, without leaving hold of the steering wheel. As known, the motorcars at issue have to be constructed so that the traditional foot controls are replaced by controls that users can operate by hand. The first hand controls proposed had a lever separate from the steering wheel unit when pushed in one direction, the lever operated the accelerator, and in the contrary direction, the brake. This kind of control is almost disused, because of the obvious drawbacks it involves. A first drawback lies in that the driver has to operate the controls always with one hand only, the other one being constantly engaged on the above lever to accelerate or brake, according to each case.Useless to speak of the dangers involved by such kind of control operations. A second drawback lies in that the controls of both the accelerator and the brakes are of a selec tive kind. It is clear that there are driving situations such as uphill starts, in which a simultaneous control on both mechanisms is needed. For these reasons, there is at present a tendency to prefer separate accelerator and brake contro is, and to mount at least the first one near the steering wheel, so that, in operating it, the user is not obliged to leave hold of the steering wheel. Controls of this kind make use of a handwheel placed coaxially to the main steering wheel and tied up to the same in the rotatory motion. From this handwheel several rods go off, which run in parallel to the common axle of the wheels. These rods set going special kinematisms, such as telescopic bars and the like, arranged around the steering column, which control the accelerator. Such known controls are very expensive and not appliable very often to the standard steering wheels that are mounted on mo tocars. They are also very cumbersome, as the kinema tisms arranged around the steering column to control the accelerator, protrude remarkably in the direction radial to the column. Another drawback much more serious than the previous ones lies in that the control handwheel,which may be mounted either above or under the steering wheel, has to be operated, whenever possible, with both hands, and obviously without leaving hold of the steering wheel actually, if the control should be operated with one hand only, there would arise excentric stresses on the handwheel, such as to hinder its axial shift. The accelerator control device, which is the object of the present invention, can overcome the above drawbacks, as it is very cheap, space saving, and, thanks to the guide system it incorporates, may be operated even with one hand only, by pressing its peripheral ring. To obtain these results, the accelerator control device according to the present invention is made up by a handwheel placed coaxially to the steering wheel and preferably above it, and by support and guide means which allow for the axial shift to and from the steering wheel, as well as the control of the motorcar thanks to additional means. The above support and guide means are made up by cylindric rods running in parallel to the common axle of the two wheels, which pass through holes made in the arms of the steering wheel, and whose ends are fi xed to the arms of the control handwheel, as well as to a ring sliding on the steering hub, respectively. Another guide means is made up by a cylindric pin, possibly hollow, which is born in the middle and at the bottom by the handwheel this pin fits into a hol low hexagonal nut of adequate length, which is screwed axially to the main steering wheel and protrudes above it. The control of the acceleration is by the movement of said ring, which shifts a biro like rod that, in turn, puts into traction a wire connected either to the accelerator pedal or directly to the motorcar carburettor. Said wire may be obviously replaced by analogous devices, such as rods, bars, etc. Further characteristics of the invention shall be made clearer by the following detailed description, which relates to a solution merely suggested by way of example and by no means limitative, illustrated in the attached only drawing, wherein Figure 1 shows the axonometry and vertical section of the accelerator control device according to the present invention Figure 2 is an axial section of the device shown in figure 1. Concerning the above mentioned figures, the reference number 1 indicates the real steering wheel, in the following referred to as the steering wheel, made up by a peripheral ring 1 supported by the radial arms 2. In the example, there are three radial arms, and only two of them are visible in the figure.The steering wheel 1 is commonly mounted on a hub 3, from which a steering column 4 goes off that transmi ts to the wire wheels the working of the steering wheel. Of course, the three elements, steering wheel, hub and steering column, are rigidly tied to one ano ther for instance, the former two by means of screws 5, the latter two by a toothed coupling 6 figure 2 .The steering column 4, which revolves together with the steering wheel, is known to be covered by a slee ve 7 figure 1 , mounted in such a way as not to undergo any rotation. According to the invention, the steering column 3 is turned in such a way as to present contiguous cylindric frustums 8 and 9, the end frustum 9 having a shorter diameter compared with frustum 8. Coaxially to the steering wheel 1 and, in the illustrated instance, above it, there is a control handwheel 10, which shall be referred to in the following as the handwheel, made up by a peripheral ring 10 suE ported by as many radial arms 11 as the arms 2 of the steering wheel 1, and perfectly aligned with them. An important feature of the invention is the ring 12 around the frustum 9 of the steering column 3.This ring, whose function is to support and guide the handwheel, is peripherally equipped with threaded projections, such as, for instance, hexagonal nuts 13 welded to the above ring, and whose number shall be the same as the arms of the wheels. In said nuts 13 the ends of as many rods 14 are screwed which have been made pass through holes 15 made in the arms 2 of the steering wheel 1. The opposite ends of the rods 14, threaded internally, are aligned, preferably with the interposition of washers 16, with the holes 17 figure 2 , made in the arms 11 of the handwheel, and aligned, in their turn, with the above holes 15, so that the screws 18 can fix the handwheel to the rods. To better guide the axial shift of the handwheel 10 as to the steering wheel 1, shift which shall be explained in the following, there is another guiding device, made up by a cylindric pin 19 borne in the middle by the handwheel the pin fits into an hexagonal nut 20, opportunely elongated and screwed to the threaded end 4 of the steering column 4 inside the hub 3 figure 2 . To make sure that the pin 19 slide always axially in the nut 20, this last has inside, at the free end, a bush 21 figure 2 , in anti friction material, Teflon for instance, which adheres perfectly to the external surface of the pin.Such bush 21 may also be replaced by at least three bearings. When mounted, around the pin 19 and the nut 20, and between the upper surface of the steering wheel 1 and the bottom surface of the handwheel 10, there is a thrust spring 22 which, when at rest, allows for the maximum distance between the wheels said distance is determined by the stop shot of the ring 12, made up by the step 8 between the trunks 8 and 9 of the hub 3. The spring 22 is covered by a rubber bellows 23 whose vertical section is shown in figure 1. In order to make up for the working tolerances and to prevent any clearances in the sliding of the ring 12 on the hub trunk 9, there are around the ring several adjustable pins 24 figure 1 in anti friction material, Teflon for instance, which pass through the depth of the ring and adhere to the external surface of the trunk 9. The mechanism which allows for the motorcar acce leration is described in the following, wherein reference is made to the example shown in Figure 1. The sliding of the ring 12 on the trunk 9 is obtained by keeping hold of the steering wheel 1 with both hands, and pushing downwards, for instance with the thumb, the handwheel 10. The flat part 12 of the ring 12, which is always in contact with the ball point 25 of a biro like rod 25, which slides into aligned holes made in a support stirrup 26, connected by means of a support plate 27 to the sleeve 7 of the steering column 4, permits the axial shift of said rod. The end of the rod 25, coming out of the stirrup 26, keeps constrained the sheath 29 of a steel wire 30, whose end 31 is restrained by a wing of said stirrup 26, while the other end, non visible in the figure, controls either the accelerator pedal or di rectly the motorcar carburettor. The other end 32 of the sheath 29 is kept fast by a stop nut 33 borne by the sleeve 7. It is clear that in this way, if the ends of the sheath 29 go up or away with respect to one another as a consequence of the axial shift of the rod 25, said shift of the ends brings about either the going up or away of the gear connected to the non visible end of the wire 30, so that the expected acceleration control is obtained. The rod 25 has a ball point 25 in order to avoid any friction on the flat wall 12 of the ring 12 during the rotation of this last, as it forms and integral whole with the steering unit. As shown in the figures, the control device of the invention is very economical, as it is made up by few low cost pieces, has a minimum encumbrance and may be easily controlled in any driving situations, even with one only hand operating on the handwheel 10 this last may also be free wheel moun ted by means of three bearings at least. In fact, thanks to the double guide systems made up by the ring 12 sliding around the trunk 9 of the hub 3 and the pin 19 borne by the handwheel and sli ding inside the nut 20 fixed to the steering wheel, one can operate the handwheel 10 even with the thumb only of the hand which, at the same time, keeps hold of the steering wheel 1, without any danger of offcentering the handwheel sliding which would hinder the shift. Many changes may obviously be done to the details of the acceleration control device which is the object of the present invention, hereinbefore described and illustrated with reference to a possible solution shown by way of example. Such changes would not affect the very substance of the invention.
