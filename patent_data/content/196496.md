# Printed circuit conductor test system.

## Abstract
A system 20 for testing conductor lines 22 in a printed circuit board 24 includes circuitry for the burning out of constricted regions of the printed circuit lines so as to insure that such defects are noticed. The system includes circuitry 48 for measuring the resistance in a path 50, 28, 60, 36 through a printed circuit line 22 under test and including connecting circuitry 50 to a generator 30, 42 of an electrical pulse. A resistor network 28 and switching circuitry 62 is employed for adjusting the resistance of the path to a desired value. The electrical pulse is generated by the discharge of a capacitor 30 previously charged 32 to a predetermined value of voltage, the discharge occuring via a pulsing circuit switch 42 which limits the duration of the pulse to a predetermined value sufficiently short to prevent damage to the circuit board associated with excessive heating. Monitoring circuitry 40 including a peak detector and comparators is employed for sensing a sudden change in test current amplitude, as well as test currents having amplitudes of an acceptable range, for terminating 76 the test current pulse prematurely upon an indication of burnout, thereby to protect the circuit board 24 .
