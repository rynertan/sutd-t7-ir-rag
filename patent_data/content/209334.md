# Current mirror circuit.

## Abstract
A current mirror circuit has first and second transistors 1, 2 which have their emitters in common and constitute a dif ferential amplification circuit, third and fourth transistors 3,4 which have their bases in common and an input current source Iin . Emitters of said first and second transistors 1, 2 are con nected to a constant current source Io , a collector of the second transistor 2 is connected to bases of the third and fourth transistors 3,4 , and a collector on the third transistor 3 is connected to a base of the first transistor 1 . A base of the second transistor 2 is connected to a bias node VB1 , emitters of the third and fourth transistors 3, 4 are connected to a reference power source Vcc , and a collector of the fourth transistor 4 is connected to an output node Iout . A collector of the first transistor 1 is connected to the reference power source Vcc through a load resistance R
