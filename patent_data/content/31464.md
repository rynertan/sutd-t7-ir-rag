# Copier.

## Abstract
Electrical components in an elongated array are can tilevered within the interior of a closed loop rotatable photo conductor drum belt 205 of a compact copier. Some of the components are mounted on a board 233 . A drive motor 225 is attached as part of the array and arranged to drive a fan 230 so that cooling air is forced through the sleeve of the belt and over the components, the sleeve acting as a plenum. Power can be coupled from the drive motor through end mounts to move the sleeve in the direc tion od its closed loop and provide power to other compo nents of the copier.
