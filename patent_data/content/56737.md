# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE USING MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY

## Abstract
In a molecular beam epitaxy process, a semiconductor layer is evaporated onto a substrate 13 in a vacuum vessel 11 under ultra high vacuum, from a first evaporation source 124 . Subsequently, an insulator layer and a metal layer are evaporated onto the semiconductor layer from further sources 12, 12 , 12 , 121 . To prevent the formation of surface states in the interface between the layers, which might adversely affect the mobility of carriers in a MOSFET subsequently formed, these subsequent layers are formed without removing the substrate from the vacuum.
