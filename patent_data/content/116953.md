# Alignment apparatus.

## Abstract
The present invention discloses, in an aligner system wherein a mask 2 and a wafer 1 are arranged so as to oppose to each other with a predetermined gap therebe tween, an alignment apparatus comprising an objective which 5 focuses an alignment mark formed on the mask 2 and an alignment mark formed on the wafer 1 a photode tector 8 which images both the alignment marks an optical length varying optical system which includes at least one rectangular prism 20 42, 46 that moves along a guide rectilinearly between said objective and the focusing posi tion, to change an optical length and to bring each of the aligment marks into focus, light rays from the alignment marks entering said prism and existing therefrom even numbered times so that the first entrance and the last exit may be shifted, the first entrance receiving optical images from said objective, the last exit being directed toward said photodetector 8 a displacement detecting sensor 27 which detects a magnitude of the movement of said rectangular prism 20 42, 46 of said optical length varying optical system magnification compensation means 28 to compensate magnitudes of displacements of the respective alignment marks detected by said photodetector, from an optic axis by calculation based on the movement magnitude of said rectangular prism detected by said displacement detecting sensor 27 , the optical length and a focal distance of said objective, so as to equalize magnifications of the images, and means 64 to detect a relative displacement magnitude between the mask and the wafer by the use of the images of the equal magnifications compensated by said magnification compensation means, whereby the mask and the wafer can be aligned at high sensitivity and at high accuracy.
