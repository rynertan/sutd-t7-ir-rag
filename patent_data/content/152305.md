## Description
This invention relates to a method of measuring a biological ligand, for example, medicinal substances and trace components derived from various diseases which may be found in a humoral fluid such as blood or urine. The measurement of the concentration in the blood of a drug administered to a patient, for example digoxin or theophylline, is important to the appropriate treatment, and the detection of trace materials derived from various diseases such as cancer which are to be found in the blood of an examinee is important in early diagnosis of the diseases. A humoral fluid such as blood contains a variety of components, and some of them possess similar molecular weights or physiological properties. Hence the measurement of such components requires high specificity and high sensitivity. Furthermore, in order that it should be readily usable in an inspection method for diagnosis of a disease, the measuring procedure should be simple. Various methods have been developed for detecting these trace components in blood and of these enzyme immunoassay has become widely employed because of its superior sensitivity and specificity and its capacity for use in the rapid treatment of a large number of samples. However, the sensitivity is not sufficient with conventional enzyme immunoassay and it is not easy to obtain an exact measurement of the concentration of a particular component because of the complicated washing procedures and the transferring of tubes which are involved. The present inventors have investigated various enzyme immunoassays using various combinations of a ligand or an antibody and an enzyme or a material having an enzyme inhibitory activity as follows. There is described in Japanese published patent application No.142466 1984 a method of measuring a biological ligand which comprises, contacting a ligand 1 to be measured and a combination of a ligand 2 having an antigenic determinant common to one of the antigenic determinant s of the above ligand 1 and biotin or a derivative thereof capable of reacting with avidin or streptoavidin as biotinyl enzyme inhibitor, with an antibody capable of reacting with the above common antigenic determinant in an aqueous solution, contacting the above combination with a biotinyl enzyme inhibitor such as avidin, streptoavidin or one of their derivatives capable of reacting with biotin, and measuring the residual biotinyl enzyme activity. In the method of EP A 0119767 for measuring a biological ligand, there are brought into contact with each other in aqueous solution a a ligand to be measured, b an enzyme or a combination of an enzyme and a macromolecular substance, and c either a combination of an antibody against the above ligand and an antibody against the above enzyme, or a combination of an antibody against the above ligand, an antibody against the above enzyme and a macromolecular substance, determining the residual activity of the enzyme and utilising the result obtained as a measure of the ligand. In our EP A 0124366, there is disclosed a method of measuring a biological ligand, characterised by allowing there to coexist in an aqueous medium In our EP A 0132292, there is described a method of measuring a biological ligand which comprises allowing there to coexist in an aqueous medium a system comprising A a ligand 1 to be measured, B a combination of a biotinyl enzyme inhibitor and a ligand 2 having an antigenic determinant which is also an antigenic determinant of ligand 1 and C an antibody capable of reacting with the said antigenic determinant, contacting said system with a biotinyl enzyme, measuring the residual biotinyl enzyme activity and utilising the measurement thereby obtained as a measure of the biological ligand. Finally, the present inventors have proposed in EP A 0144176 European patent Application No.84307834.6 a method of measuring a biological ligand which comprises allowing there to coexist in an aqueous medium a system comprising A a ligand 1 to be measured, B either a combination 1 of an antibody against the ligand 1 and an enzyme capable of acting on a water insoluble macromolecular substance or a combination 2 of a said enzyme and a ligand 2 having an antigenic determinant which is an antigenic determinant of said ligand 1 , which combination 2 is present in the aqueous medium together with a said antibody, and C a said macromelecular substance, determining the residual activity of the enzyme after it has acted on said macromelecular substance and utilising the measurement thereby obtained as a measure of the biological ligand. This last method has now been investigated further and it has been found that when an amylase is employed as the enzyme, the ligand 1 can be detected with very high sensitivity. However, when using a sample derived from a higher animal, since the sample usually contains an amylase, the reading for a blank is high, thereby leading to large errors. Hence investigations have been carried out in order to lower the value of blank determinations, i.e. to cancel out the effect of the amylase originally present in the sample. However, when the amylase in a sample was previously inactivated. for example by heating our by treating with an acid or an alkali, some ligands in the sample were also denatured or decomposed simultaneously. On the other hand, when the sample was diluted in order to lower the blank value, the sensitivity of the method for detecting the ligand 1 was also lowered. In addition, since such additional steps make the operation more complicated, their use is contrary to the general aim of providing a simple method for measuring the ligand 1 . It is an object of this invention to provide a method of measuring a biological ligand in a sample containing an amylase in which the effect of amylase in the sample is reduced without sacrificing the simplicity and high sensitivity of the method. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of measuring a biological ligand in a sample containing an amylase from a higher animal, which comprises bringing into contact with each other in an aqueous medium a sample derived from a higher animal containing A a ligand 1 to be measured and B the amylase 1 from the higher animal, C a an antibody 1 against said ligand 1 to which is bound an amylase 2 not contained in said sample or b an antibody 1 against said ligand 1 and a biological ligand 2 to which is bound an amylase 2 not contained in said sample, said ligand 2 having at least one antigenic determinant in common with said ligand 1 , and D an amylase inhibitor whose inhibitory activity against said amylase 1 is stronger than that against said amylase 2 , the said antibody reacting a with said ligand 1 or b with said ligand 1 and with said ligand 2 to which said amylase 2 is covalently coupled and the said amylase inhibitor reacting with said amylase 1 , digesting with said amylase 2 E a water insoluble macromolecular substrate of said amylase 2 and determining the residual activity of said amylase 2 and utilising the measurement thereby obtained a s a measure of said ligand 1 , The amylase 1 derived from a higher animal contained in a sample being measured by the method of the invention is, for example, pancreatic amylase or salivary amylase of any higher animal. The nature of the sample is not significant to the method of this invention and it may be, for example serum, plasma or urine. In the case of serum and urine, no pretreatment is necessary. The aim of the method of the invention is to measure a ligand 1 . The ligand 1 is a substance having one or more antigenic determinants, and may be, for example, a hormone derived from one of various endocrine glands, a plasma protein such as immunoglobulin, albumin and ferritin, a viral antigen such as HB antigen, bacteria, α fetoprotein or a carcinoembryonic antigen. The ligand 2 , when used, also has one or more antigenic determinant s of ligand 1 . All antigenic determinants of ligand 2 may be antigenic determinants of ligand 1 , and accordingly, ligand 2 may be identical with ligand 1 . The antibody 1 used is an antibody against the ligand 1 . When a ligand 2 is employed, this antibody should also be an antibody against ligand 2 . Thus, in such a case, the antibody should be an antibody against the aforementioned common antigenic determinant. The antibody may be, for example, a fragment of immunoglobulin, for example F ab ₂, Fab or Fab, or such a fragment modified by introduction of a DNP group, acetyl group, biotinyl group or nitro group. Such an antibody may be isolated by a conventional method of producing an antibody. For example, ligand 1 , ligand 2 if to be used or a covalently coupled conjugate of either of these ligands and a protein material is injected once or several times into the subcutaneous region of the back, foot pad or femoral muscle of a warm blooded animal such as a rabbit, goat, horse, guinea pig or chicken, in an amount of from 0.3 to 2 mg per kg body weight together with an adjuvant, and the required antibody is produced in a humoral fluid such as serum. This humoral fluid may be used as such as the antibody source. However, the antibody is preferably separated by a conventional isolation method for an immunoglobulin. Alternatively, the antibody may be produced as a monoclonal antibody. In this case, one of the above antigens is injected several times into the abdominal cavity of a mouse together with an adjuvant, and its spleen is excised. A spleen cell is fused with a mouse myeloma cell by a conventional method involving the use of polyethylene glycol. The hybridoma thus obtained is cultured and cloned, and a cell capable of producing the desired antibody is obtained. This cell is injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse, and multiplied. Then, ascites are collected, and the desired antibody is separated from the ascites. If the antibody C is not covalently coupled to the amylase 2 , The amylase 2 does not exist initially in the sample under test and it is employed covalently coupled to the above antibody C or to the ligand 2 . This amylase 2 is, for example α amylase, β amylase or glucoamylase. The choice of amylase 2 will vary according, for example, to the nature of the sample under test and the nature of the amylase inhibitor to be used, as will be described hereinafter. More specifically, it is for example diastase or β amylase derived from malt, taka diastase derived from a mould, or amylase derived from a bacterium of genus Amylase 2 is covalently coupled to the antibody 1 or to a ligand 2 . When it is to be coupled with the antibody, the ligand 2 is not used. On the other hand, when it is to be coupled with the ligand 2 , the antibody is used in its natural form or covalently coupled with a macromolecular compound as mentioned hereinbefore. The method of coupling the amylase 2 with the antibody 1 or the ligand 2 will generally depend on the functional groups of both substances. Such functional groups include, amino groups, carboxyl groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, imidazole groups and phenyl groups. The binding of amino groups, may be carried out by many methods including the diisocyanate method, the glutaraldehyde method, the difluorobenzene method, and the benzoquinone method. For binding an amino group and a carboxyl group, it is possible to use the peptide binding method for binding a carboxyl group to a succinimido ester group, the carbodiimide method and the Woodward reagent method. The periodate oxidation method Nakane method in which a bridge is formed between amino groups and sugar chain forms may also be utilised for this purpose. When using a thiol group, a carboxyl group, for example, is first converted to a succinimido ester group, and this ester group is then allowed to react with cysteine to introduce a thiol group, and both thiol groups which are present are bound by using a thiol reactive bifunctional cross linking reagent, for example phenylene bismaleimide. Methods utilising a phenyl group include the diazotization method and the alkylation method. In addition to the foregoing, there may be considered one of various methods described in Methods in Immunology and Immunochemistry C.A. Williams et al., 1976, Academic Press N.Y. and Koso Meneki Sokutei ho E. Ishikawa et al., 1978, Igaku shoin Japan . The molar ratio of the combination is not limited to 1 1, and other suitable ratios can be selected. After the binding reaction, the combination produced is purified by gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography, and lyophilized, if necessary. When the amylase 2 has been coupled with the antibody 1 , the antibody is allowed to contact the ligand 1 to be measured. When the amylase 2 has been coupled with the ligand 2 , the antibody is allowed to contact the ligand 1 and the ligand 2 portion of the combination of ligand 2 and amylase 2 . In the latter case, the order of the contacting is immaterial, and either of the ligand 1 and the combination of ligand 2 and amylase 2 may first be allowed to make contact with the antibody. Of course, both the ligand 1 and the combination of ligand 2 and amylase 2 may be allowed to make contact with the antibody at the same time. The temperature of the aqueous solution being used is usually kept at from 20 to 45 If the antibody 1 is not employed covalently coupled with the amylase 2 and if the activity of the amylase 2 does not appreciably vary as a result of the reaction of the antibody with the ligand 2 portion of the covalently coupled combination, a second antibody 3 may be introduced to react with the antibody 1 which is covalently coupled to the ligand 2 portion of the combination thereof with amylase 2 . The second antibody 3 may be prepared by following one of the procedures previously described herein. On the other hand, when the antibody 1 is used in covalently coupled combination the amylase 2 , the sensitivity is raised by one or two orders by adding another antibody 2 which is an antibody against a different antigenic determinant of the ligand 1 from that which to which the first antibody is an antibody. This antibody may also be produced by following a conventional method as aforedescribed. Since the antibody in the humoral fluid is a mixture of antibodies recognising various antigenic determinants, it is necessary for them to be separated. The separation may be carried out by affinity chromatography. For example, the ligand 1 is digested by an enzyme or a chemical reagent, and the fragments produced are separated by gel filtration or ion exchange chromatography. Each fragment is immobilised on a carrier, and hence a column for affinity chromatography is prepared. The above mixture of antibodies is separated by using this column. It is sufficient for the mixture of antibodies to be separated into two groups The method of producing a monoclonal antibody by using the cell fusion technique described previously is suitable for the production of such a specific antibody. A water soluble macromolecular compound may be covalently coupled to the antibody in order to raise the sensitivity. A molecular weight of greater than 1,000 is preferable. Examples of such macromolecular compounds include proteins such as albumin and haemocyanin, polysaccharides, polyethylene glycol and polynucleotides. The coupling method used may be one of those previously described for binding of amylase 2 . A second antibody 4 may be coupled to this antibody 2 in order to raise the sensitivity. The second antibody 2 may also be prepared by following a method as previously described. This second antibody 4 may be added to the antibody 2 prior to contacting with the ligand 1 or at the same time. In the method of this invention, the amylase 1 derived from a higher animal and present in the sample under test is brought into contact with an amylase inhibitor whose inhibitory activity against amylase 1 is stronger than that against amylase 2 . The most desirable amylase inhibitor inactivates all amylases 1 present in the sample and does not inhibit amylase 2 . However, it is sufficient for practical purposes that the amylase inhibitor inactivates the main amylase 1 in the sample. The inactivation is maintained throughout the determination, and the activity of amylase 1 may be restored after the determination. Examples of such amylase inhibitors include the amylase inhibitor derived from wheat which inhibits both salivary amylase and pancreatic amylase M.D. O Donnell et al., Biochim, Biophys. Acta, vol. 422, pp159 169 1976 , amylase inhibtor Sain derived from wheat which preferentially inhibits salivary amylase Japanese Patent Application Kokai 85899 1983 and amylase inhibitor AI B produced by an actinomycetes of genus The temperature and the pH of the aqueous solution while the amylase inhibitor is in contact with the amylase 1 are usually chosen to be the same as the temperature and pH conditions under which contacting of the ligand 1 with the antibody is carried out. The amount of amylase inhibitor used depends on its character, the character and the amount of amylase 1 , the character of amylase 2 and the contacting conditions. The amount used is preferably determined by a preliminary test. The amylase inhibitor is usually added prior to the addition of the water insoluble macromolecular substance. However, since the inhibitory action of the amylase inhibitor is generally much faster than the decomposition rate of the substrate by the amylase 1 , the amylase inhibitor may be added together with the macromolecular substrate E The final constituent of the system to be discussed is water insoluble macromolecular substrate E capable of digestion by amylase 2 . The bound amylase 2 will usually already be present in the reaction solution, although it may be separated from it when the water insoluble macromolecular substrate is added. The macromolecular substance E is able to be digested by the amylase 2 , and it is usually a substrate for amylase 2 . The macromolecular substrate E is characterised by its property of insolubility in water. This means that most of the contacting of the macromolecular substrate with the bound amylase 2 is carried out at the boundary between solid and solution, and as a result, steric hindrance of macromolecule s bound to the amylase 2 largely occurs. This is supported by an experiment which has been carried out where a pentose and an insoluble starch were digested by an α amylase which was in its natural form or which had previously been allowed to combine with a macromolecule. As a result of the experiment, enzyme activity was hardly lowered by the combination of the macromolecule in the case of the pentose, while it was considerably lowered in the case of the insoluble starch. The macromolecular substances include insoluble starches. When a macromolecular substrate which is available is water soluble, it may be subjected to insolubilisation. The insolubilisation may be carried out by covalent coupling with an insoluble carrier material or by subjecting the water soluble macromolecule substance to polymerisation. For example, the water soluble macromolecular substance is entrapped with agarose gel. The conditions for the enzyme reaction will be determined by the amylase 2 employed. After the reaction, the residual amylase 2 activity is determined by detecting the changes in the reaction mixture, such as the increase of a decomposition product, the decrease of the raw material, etc. Any of the methods described in the earlier patent applications discussed hereinabove may be used as appropriate. Some of the methods will be apparent from the examples which follow. By carrying out the method of this invention, a biological ligand 1 in a sample derived from a higher animal and containing an amylase such as human serum can be detected and determined in high sensitivity and in high specificity. The operation of this method is simple, and a biological ligand 1 can easily and inexpensively be determined. There is no limitation to the type of ligand 1 to be measured and the present method is particularly suitable for determining a ligand having a relatively high molecular weight. When using a covalently coupled combination of the antibody and the amylase 2 , since the ligand 1 is used only as an antigen which is necessary to produce the antibody, the amount of the ligand 1 may be very small. Accordingly, this method is effective when only a small amount of ligand 1 can be obtained or when the ligand 1 is extremely expensive. Hitherto a method of measuring a lower hapten such as digoxin or theophylline bound to an enzyme has been reported. However, no method of measuring an extremely small amount of an antigen of the order of ng ml level, the antigen having a molecular weight of more than 10,000, has bee reported. The present invention offers a highly sensitive method of determining a macromelecular antigen, and it has extended the level of the hitherto employed determinations from g ml to ng ml. Moreover our EP A 0144176 referred to earlier herein and as published on 12th June 1985, discloses a method of measuring theophylline 1 in a sample of human serum containing amylase 2 which comprises bringing into contact with each other the serum sample containing the theophylline, anti theophylline mouse IgG as antibody 3 against the theophylline, a covalently coupled combination of α amylase and theophylline 4 and anti human amylase goat IgG as an amylase inhibitor 5 whose inhibiting activity against amylase 2 is stronger that that against said α amylase for said antibody 3 to react with the theophylline of said sample and the theophylline to which the α amylaseis covalently coupled and for said amylase inhibitor 5 to react with said amylase 2 , digesting starch with the α amylase and determining the residual activity of said α amylase and utilising the measurement thereby obtained as a measure of the theophylline in said human serum sample.
