# A process for the preparation of alkyl silicates.

## Abstract
Tetraalkyl orthosilicates may be prepared in good yield by contacting an alkanol having 1 to about 4 carbon atoms with copper activated silicon synthesized by heating a mix ture of cupric oxide and silicon particles at elevated tempera tures at a temperature of about 120 250 C under autogeneous pressure.
