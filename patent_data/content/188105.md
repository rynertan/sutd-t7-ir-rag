# Microwave method of perforating a polymer film.

## Abstract
A method of forming perforations 18 in polymer film 10 includes the steps of forming a conductive film pattern 16 on the film 10 , preferably in a bow tie shape, using a material with a moderate resistivity and applying a micro wave field across the film 10 for a few seconds whereupon sufficient electrical energy is generated in the conductive pattern 16 to perforate the polymer film 10 . This method is operative even when the polymer film 10 is laminated between layers 12,14 of other dielectric material prior to the microwave processing step.
