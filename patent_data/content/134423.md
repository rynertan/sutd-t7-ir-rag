# LOADABLE CHARACTER GENERATOR APPARATUS AND RELATED LOADING METHOD

## Abstract
A loadable character generator apparatus is disclosed whose operation can be changed to suit various needs such as foreign language requirements, with minimum added hardware. The apparatus translates the character code of a character to be displayed to the dot pattern for that particular pattern utilizing a screen buffer 7, 8 storing character codes of the characters to be displayed on a screen and a read write store 14 . A control unit 20 loads the screen buffer with the character codes and a Cathode Ray Tube Controller 3 controls the addressing of both the buffer and the store. The addition of a controller loading path 13 from the output of buffer 7, 8 to the input of store 14 enable the store 14 to be loaded from the buffer, with any desired dot pattern set, under exclusive control of the cathode ray tube controller. A related loading method is also described.
