# Magnetic recording system.

## Abstract
In a magnetic recording system for recording frequency modulated video signals on a magnetic tape 1 field by field at intervals of a predetermined time by a plurality of rotary video heads 2, 3 , during each recording period the rotation speed of the rotary video heads 2, 3 is made different from the steady state rotation speed and the video signals are recorded thereby making the period of each field of the recorded video signals an integral multiple of the horizontal scanning period.
