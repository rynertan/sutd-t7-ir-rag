# CLOSURE FOR PIPES OR VESSELS

## Abstract
A closure for an opening in a pressure pipe or vessel is adapted to co operate with an annular groove about the opening. The closure has three wedge shaped locking pieces which may be moved into locking engagement with the annular groove by the action of levers pivotally attached to the locking pieces and to an angularly displaceable cen tral boss. The central boss includes three radially outwardly directed extensions which, on rotation of the central boss to lock the closure, are brought into alignment with three radi ally inwardly directed extensions one on an end of each of the locking pieces. The aligned extensions co operate to prevent radial inward movement of the locking pieces in the locked position.
