# LIQUID CONTAINER AND DISPENSER

## Abstract
A collapsible multilayer bag 10 formed from a plurality of substantially impermeable plastics sheets 14, 15,16 joined together around their peripheries is located within an inextensible outer casing, e.g. a cylindrical cardboard casing 11 with end plates 12, 13 . Liquid, such as beer, can be filled into a first interlayer space 27 of the bag 10 via first inlet outlet means 17 against a counter pressure provided by a pressure medium, such as air or water, in second interlayer space 28 which is gradually bled off via second inlet outlet means 18 . The liquid is subsequently dispensed by controlled supply of pressure medium to the second interlayer space 28 so as to exert pressure on the liquid filled space 27 .
