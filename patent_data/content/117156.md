## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF TRANS i, 2 DIRALOPHOSPHINO CYCLOALKANES The present invention relates in general to a process for the production of trans 1,2 bis dihalophosphino cycloalkan and derivatives thereof. Trans i, 2 bis dihalophosphino cycloalkanes are readily converted to trans 1,2 bis dihydrocarbyl phosphino cycloalkanes which are useful as ligands in asymmetric synthesis, ie a reaction that converts a prochiral centre into a chiral centre in such a way that the enantiomers are produced in unequal amounts. Two catalytic asymmetric syntheses that have been studied extensively are hydrogenation and hydrosilylation. The catalysts contain optically active ligands coordinated to a transition metal. The majority of the reactions studied use rhodium as the metal although reactions with cobalt, nickel, palladium, copper, etc are also known. The chiral ligands are generally phosphines, some of the most successful ligands being bidentate bisphosphines.Other asymmetric syntheses which have been studied use hydroformylation and carbonylation, though the stereoselectivities observed in these syntheses were much less satisfactory than in asymmetric hydrogenation reactions. US Patent No 3,976,690 Stauffer Chemical Company describes a process for the production of alkane bis dihalophosphines by reacting an olefin of formula R1 R2 C C R3 R4 wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from a group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms with a trivalent phosphorus compound of the formula PX3 wherein X is chlorine or bromine in the presence of elemental phosphorus. The reaction is conducted at a temperature of from about 150 0C to about 3500C under at least autogenous pressure. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the production of a transl,2 bis dihalophosphino cycloalkane which process comprises reacting a C3 to C12 cyclic olefin with a trivalent phosphorus compound of the formula PX3 wherein X is chlorine or bromine in the presence of elemental phosphorus. Preferably the cyclic olefin contains from 3 to 10, even more preferably from 5 to 10 carbon atoms. Suitable cyclic olefins include cyclopropene, cyclobutene, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, cycloheptene, cyclononene and cyclodecene. Alternatively, the cyclic olefin may be substituted by, for example, alkyl groups or functional groups such as halogroups. Preferred cyclic olefins include cyclopentene and cyclohexene. Cyclic diolefins may also be used. Preferably the trivalent phosphorus compound is phosphorus trichloride. The reaction is carried out in the presence of elemental phosphorus. The elemental phosphorus may be used in any of its common elemental forms including white or yellow or red.Preferably the phosphorus is in the white form. The process may be operated in the presence of a diluent.Suitable diluents include hydrocarbons, which may be aliphatic or aromatic, or halo sub stituted. Examples of suitable diluents include benzene, toluene and hexane. Alternatively, the trivalent phosphorus compound may itself be used as a diluent. It is preferred to operate the process under substantially anhydrous conditions. The use of an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon, may also be advantageous. The relative proportions of reactants may suitably be varied over a wide range. Generally, from 2 to 4 moles of cyclic olefin to 4 to 10 moles of the trivalent phosphorus compound to 1 to 3 gram atoms of phosphorus will be found suitable. It is preferred to use an excess of the trivalent phosphorus compound. The process may be operated at a temperature in the range from 100 to 300 C, preferably from 200 to 3000C. Using a closed reaction vessel, the pressure may vary from autogenous up to 200 atmospheres above autogenous pressure. The process may be operated batchwise or continuously, preferably continuously. The products of the process of the present invention may be recovered and purified in conventional manner, suitably by fractional distillation, crystallisation or solvent extraction. Tran s 1 ,2 bi s dihalopho sphino cycloalkane s may be converted into either the corresponding transl,2 bis dihydrocarbyl phosphino cycloalkanes or the corresponding trans 1,2 bis dialkoxyphosphino cycloalkanes by reaction with a suitable carbon nucleophile, for instance a suitable Grignard reagent. In another aspect therefore the invention provides a process for the production of a trans 1,2 bis di X phosphino cycloalkane, wherein X is hydrocarbyl or alkoxy, which process comprises reacting a transl,2 bis dihalophosphino cycloalkane with an X containing carbon nucleophile wherein X is hydrocarbyl or alkoxy under appropriate reaction conditions. Suitably the X containing carbon nucleophile may be aGrignard reagent, for example an X magnesium halide, wherein X is hydrocarbyl or alkoxy. Suitably the hydrocarbyl substituent of the hydrocarbyl magnesium halide may be an alkyl group which may be for example a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl group, or a cycloalkyl group such as cyclohexyl, or a phenyl group. Suitably the alkoxy substituent of the alkoxy magnesium halide may be for example methoxy, ethoxy or butoxy. The halide moiety is preferably either chloride or bromide. It is preferred to employ a diluent. Suitable diluents include oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as, for example, tetrahydrofuran. The process may be operated at ambient or elevated temperature and at atmospheric pressure. Suitably, the reactants may be mixed at room temperature and the mixture thereafter refluxes. The tran1 ,2 bis dihydrocarbylphosphino cycloalkanes may be resolved into their separate enantiomers in conventional manner. In the particular case of transl,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentane, reaction with nickel 11 halide may be effected in alcoholic media to produce the corresponding nickel 11 halide adduct, which may thereafter be crystallised from, for example, dichloromethane with a molecule of dichloromethane of crystallisation as the conglomerate nickel 11 halide trans l, 2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentane dichloromethanei. Separation of this latter conglomerate into S,S and S,S enantiomers may be effected manually by crystal picking.Thereafter the S,S trans 1,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentane may be recovered by treatment of the S,S enantiomer with sodium cyanide. The resolved enantiomers of transl,2 bi s dihydrocarbyl phosphino cycloalkanes so obtained may be used as chiral ligands in asymmetric synthesis, such as for example hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hydroformylation and carbonylation. The invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following Examples. All preparations and manipulations were carried out in vacuo or under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were dried and distilled before use. I.R. spectra were determined for Nujol mulles on aUnicam SF 2000 instrument. N.M.R. spectra were measured at room temperature in dried C6D6 for the products of Examples 1, 3 and 8 in dried CD2C12 for all other compounds. The N.M.R. spectra were recorded on Bruker WE 300KXz and Bruker AM 250mew instruments.Optical rotations were measured at 200C in CH2C12 on a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter at a concentration of 1.0 mg cm3 for the product ofExample 2 and at 0.1 mg cm3 for all other compounds, the single crystals being weighed on an electromicrobalance. A. SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUNDSExample 1 Trans 1,2 bis dichlorophosphino cyclopentane A 1.1 litre stainless steel autoclave, supplied by BaskervilleCo, was charged with phosphorus trichloride 510g, 3.92 mol , white phosphorus 29 g, 0.23 mol and dried and freshly distilled cyclopentene 180g, 2.65 mol . The mixture was stirred and the temperature was raised over a period of 24 hours until it reached 215 C. The mixture was maintained at this temperature with stirring for 40 hours when it was allowed to cool to room temperature. The brown liquid product was extracted and was washed from the autoclave with dry tetrahydrofuran 400 cm3 . The extract was filtered and the more volatile components were removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The residual dark brown liquor was distilled under reduced pressure.There was a volatile fraction which distilled at 36 380C 0.5 mm Hg 12.56g shown to be PC12CgHg 12.5g, 15 and a second main fraction distilled at 103 1050C at 0.1mm Hg 109.2g . The brown tarry residue was discarded. The second product was carefully redistilled and the fraction which distilled at 119 1220C and 0.1 mmEg was collected and shown to be the pure compound. Yield 37.5 cm3.Example 2 Tran sbisl ,2 diphenylphosphino cyclopentane Trans bis 1, 2 dichlorophosphino cyclopentane 10.lg, 37.0 mmol obtained as in Example 1, in dried tetrahydrofuran 200 cm3 was added dropwise to a stirred solution of phenylmagnesium bromide 150 cm3 of a 1.3 M solution in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. After the addition was complete the mixture was ref fluxed for 1 hour. The mixture was allowed to cool then aqueous ammonium chloride ca 100 cm3 was added to hydrolyse the excess of the Grignard reagent. Water 300 cm3 was then added and the mixture was shaken. The organic products were extracted with several portions of diethyl ether 4 x 100 cm3 and the ethereal extracts were combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate.The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the resulting cream solid was extracted with petroleum ether 60 800C 3 x 150 cm3 . The extracts were filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure giving large white crystals which were collected, washed with petroleum ether 40 600C and dried in vacuo. Yield 12.5g, 77.1 . Example 3 Tran s l ,2 bi s dimethylpho sphino cyclopentane Dry magnesium turnings 24.8g 1.03 moles and methyl iodide 125.9g 0.88 moles , dried over molecular sieve, were reacted in diethyl ether to give 570 cm3 of 0.72M methyl Grignard standardised against HCl . Trans i ,2 bi s dichlorophosphino cyclopentane 27.6g 0.10 moles , obtained as in Example 1, in degassed tetrahydrofuran 400 cm3 was added in 90 minutes at room temperature to theGrignard reagent, with gentle refluxing for an additional 90 minutes. Excess Grignard was carefully destroyed by addition of degassed, saturated NH4C1 135g , followed by degassed water 135g . The organic layer was separated and dried over MgSO4 for four days. The dried, filtered solution was concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature, giving a pale yellow liquid.Distillation in an all glass apparatus gave 7.6g 41X of a colourless liquid, b.p. 82 83 C at 1.5mm Hg. The compound is very sensitive to oxidation in air, but is stable under a nitrogen atmosphere.Example 4Trans 1,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentanenickel 11 Bromide Anhydrous nickel II bromide 5.lug, 0.023 moles was heated in water 15 cm3 to dissolve. Ethanol 105 cm3 was added and the green solution filtered, to remove insoluble, olive green NiO, and degasssed. The phosphine as obtained in Example 2 10.lug, 0.023 moles , dissolved in hot, degassed ethanol 400 cm3 was added with stirring to the nickel bromide solution at 60 70 C. The purple red microcrystalline product came out of solution quickly. The supernatant liquor was removed by filtration, the product washed in cold ethanol 2 x 10 cm3 and finally dried in vacuo at 500C yield 8.9g, 57 .The yield could have presumably been increased by reducing the volume of the supernatant liquor, which was red, the large volume of ethanol being necessary to dissolve the phosphine initially. The compound is soluble in dichloromethane about 30mg cm3 , sparingly soluble in acetone and stable in air.Example 5Trans 1 ,2 bi s diphenylphosphino cyclopentanenickel II Chloride To nickel II chloride hexahydrate 1.69g, 7.1 mmoles , dissolved in ethanol 50 cm3 was added the phosphine as obtained inExample 2 2.87g, 6.6 moles dissolved in hot ethanol 200 cm3 and the preparation continued as for Example 4 yield 3.3g, 72 . The red orange cbmptund is soluble in methylene chloride and is stable in air.Example 6 Trans i ,2 bi s diphenylpho sphino cyclopentanemolybdenum Tetracarbonyl Molybdenum hexacarb6nyl 1.OSg, 4.1 mmoles was reacted with the phosphine as obtained in Example 2 1.79g, 4.1 mmoles in light petroleum b.p. 100 1200C in the dark at 1050C with vigourous stirring under nitrogen for three days. A considerable amount of product was evident after six hours, suggesting that the reaction was much faster than the analogous reaction with 1,2 bis diphenylphosphino ethane which was also carried out under identical conditions. The supernatant liquor was removed and the cream coloured amorphous product washed with light petroleum 100 1200C and dried in vacuo at 75 C, all manipulations being done with exclusion of light as much as possible yield 2.44g, 85 . The compound is photosensitive in the solid and in solution, rapidly turning yellow in sunlight, and air sensitive, turning grey blue. The compound is soluble in dichloromethane and toluene.Sizeable crystals can be grown by slow evaporation, in a nitrogen atmosphere, of a dichloromethane solution of the compound.Example 7 Bisltrans 1,2 bis dimethylphosphino cyclopentanelnicke Bromide Anhydrous nickel II bromide 1.67g, 7.6 mmoles was heated in water 5 cm3 to dissolve. Ethanol 50 cm3 was added, the green solution filtered to remove the insoluble NiO, and degassed. The phosphine as obtained in Example 3 1.35g, 7.lmmoles , dissolved in degassed ethanol 35cm3 was added slowly with stirring to the nickel bromide solution at 60 700C. The solution immediately turned deep red but the product was much more soluble in ethanol than was the tetraphenyl analogue Example 4 . The deep red liquor was concentrated to about 20cm3 under reduced pressure and cooled to 300C for twelve hours.Red orange crystals separated, which were collected, washed with cold ethanol 2x2cm3 and finally dried in vacuo at 500C yield 1.29g, 61 yield.Example 8 Trans 1 ,2 bis dichloropho sphino cyclohexane White phosphorus 30.7g, 0.25moles , degassed phosphorus trichloride 515 g, 3.7moles and redistilled cyclohexene 205.5g, 2.5moles were placed in a l liter high pressure autoclave under a nitrogen atmosphere. During an initial period of 30 hours, the temperature was slowly raised to 2250C and held there for 44 hours, with vigourous stirring of the reaction mixture. The maximum pressure was 12 atmospheres. The products were transferred from the autoclave with degassed tetrahydrofuran 400cm3 , the mixture filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure at 500C, giving a clear, dark brown, viscous liquor. In the preparation of the compound, there was inevitably about 15 20g of finely divided, red phosphorus present in the autoclave after the reaction period.There was also evidence of unreacted cyclohexene and phosphorus trichloride. Distillation in an all glass apparatus, with a 10 inch column, gave fractions of 115g 60 65 C and 38 g 123 1250C at 2.0mm Hg, the latter being the desired tetrachloride, an air sensitive, viscous liquid.Example 9 Tran sl ,2 bi s diphenylpho sphino cyclohexane Tetrahydrofuran 400cm3 was added to 560cm3 of O.64M phenylmagnesium bromide in diethyl ether. The tetrachloride as obtained in Example 8 25.1g, 0.088moles in tetrahydrofuran 350cm3 was addedd dropwise to the Grignard reagent, over a period of 2 hours, with heating to reflux for an additional 1.5 hours. The mixture stood at room temperature overnight and the excess Grignard reagent was carefully destroyed by addition of degassed, saturatedNH4Cl 165g and degassed water 185g . The large amount of cream coloured precipitate present after addition of the NH4C1 redissolved on addition of the water. The mixture was shaken vigourously and the pale yellow organic layer dried over Na2S04 for two days.The volatile solvents were removed under reduced pressure, leaving a pale yellow, waxy solid. Recrystallization in degassed light petroleum b.p. 100 1200C gave a white solid which was dried in vacuo, yield 19.6g, 49 . Recrystallization from toluene is alsoepossible, giving the crystal on which the crystallographic analysis was performed. The solid compound is stable in air, but air sensitive in solution.Example 10 Trans I ,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclohexanenickel II Bromide Anhydrous nickel II bromide 3.25g, 14.8mmoles was heated in water 25cm3 to dissolve. Ethanol 150cm3 was added, the green solution filtered to remove the insoluble, olive green NiO, and degassed. The phosphine as obtained in Example 9 5.83g, 12.9mmoles , dissolved in hot ethanol 240cm3 , was added slowly with stirring to the nickel bromide solution at 60 7O0C. The solution instantly turned deep red and the purple red, microcrystalline product quickly precipitated. The red supernatant liquor was removed by filtration, the product washed in cold ethanol 2 x 15cm3 and dried in vacuo at 500C yield 4.98g, 57 . The compound is soluble in dichloromethane about 35mg cm3 , sparingly soluble in acetone and stable in air.Example 11 Tran s1,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclohexanenickel II Chloride To nickel II chloride hexahydrate 0.94, 3.90mmoles dissolved in ethanol 125cm3 was added the phosphine as obtained inExample 9 1.7 g 3.93 mmoles dissolved in hot ethanol 250 cm3 and the preparation continued as in Example 10. The yield was 1.65g 61 . The red orange compound is soluble in dichloromethane and stable in air. Example 12 Tran s l ,2 bi s diphenylpho sphino cyclohexanemolybdenum Tetracarbonyl Molybdenum hexacarbonyl 1.22g, 4.6mmoles was reacted with the phosphine as obtained in Example 9 2.13g, 4.7mmoles in light petroleum 100 120 C in the dark at 1000C with vigourous stirring under an inert atmosphere for three days. As in the reaction with the analogous cyclopentane phosphine, there was evidence of extensive reaction after six hours.The supernatant liquor was removed by filtration and the cream coloured amorphous solid washed with light petroleum b.p. 100 120 C and dried in vacuo at 750C yield 2.68g. 81Z. The compound is soluble in dichloromethane and toluene sizeable crystals may be grown by slow evaporation, in a nitrogen atmosphere, of a dichloromethane solution of the compound.The compound is photosensitive, turning yellow rapidly as the solid or in solution in sunlight, and is air sensitive, turning grey blue.

OPTICAL ROTATION EXPERIMENTSExample 13Trans 1,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentanenickel 11 bromide Following the observation that the complex, trans 1,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentanenlekel 11 bromide.CH2C12 underwent spontaneous resolution on crystallization from dichloromethane into enantiomerically pure crystals, further measurements involving 110 separate determinations have been made on this complex, on the free ligand and on related complexes to see if the phenomenon was more general. The single crystal or, in some instances, single crystalline fragments broken off of a cluster of crystals, were selected under a microscope and weighed in aluminium boats to O.OOlmg. The crystals used for the metal complexes were geneally about 1.Omg, but single crystals as small as O.lmg gave satisfactory results. There were, in fact, indications that for very large 300mg single crystals, the chances of inclusion of a growth on the crystal of the opposite chirality became greater. The selected crystals were quickly rinsed in a little CH2C12 on a porous glass funnel, with suction applied to remove the solvent. All measurements were made at 200C in dichloromethane.The high optical absorbance of the metal complexes required that the solutions be rather dilute, O.lmg of compound per cm3 of solvent or, in terms of the C. used in the literature, 0.01g 100cm3 solvent, C 0.01. The low concentrations introduced some scatter in the results, particularly for low observed rotations. Specific rotations were calculated from the formula 200 alpha 589nm 100 x alpha lc where alpha observed rotation in degrees 1 path length of cell in decimeters c concentration in g 100cm3 Measurements number of different samples measured given in parentheses on trans 1,2 bi s diphenylpho sphino cyclopentanenickel bromide containing a mole of CH2C12 in the weighed crystal gave 20 alpha 5gg values of 31129 11 and 323122 14 . Example 14 Trans 1,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentanenickel chloride whilst crystals were grown from CH2C12 elemental analyses indicated that the crystalline material did not contain CH2Cl2. The optical rotation measurements suggest that this compound crystallises as either racemic crystals or as enantiomerically pure conglomerates. From a given batch of crystals some would give alphai O while others showed optical activity. The results for this compound were number of different samples measured given in parentheses 20 alpha 58g 0 15 20 talpha sgg 72 6 7 , and 20 alpha 589 86J15 11 . Example 15 As has been noted hereinbefore, transl,2 bis diphenylphosphino cyclopentane, can be liberated from the NiBr2 complex by reaction with cyanide. A similar procedure using thiocyanate yielded a phosphine nickel complex with two SCH ligands replacing the Br ligands. A typical experiment is described below. Two single crystals 107.9, 63.5mg , grown by slow evaporation at constant temperature 220C from a CH2C12 solution in a covered crystallizing dish 120mm diameter , were selected under a microscope as being of the same chirality. A corner was broken off of each crystal l.442, 1.124mg for measurement of optical activity. The two large crystals totalling 168.8mg were ground up with a glass rod in the bottom of a Schlenk flask 250cm3 volume .Sodium cyanide 0.601g and a stirring bar were added to the flask and the air replaced with a nitrogen atmosphere. Degassed ethanol 14.3g was added and the mixture stirred vigourously for two hours with gentle warming, with gradual disappearance of the red crystalline nickel complex, leaving an off white suspended solid. The ethanol was removed under reduced pressure and the remaining solid dried under vacuo. Degassed benzene 3 x 10cm3 was added to the solid, the mixture being shaken after each addition and the benzene extract removed by filtration into a nitrogen atmosphere in a second Schlenk flask. A pale yellow residue of Ni CN 2 remained after the three extractions. The benzene was removed under reduced pressure, leaving a white solid which was dried in vacuo yield 79.5mg, 71 . The optical rotation data are given below for the nickel complex and for the free phosphine for this experiment. Note that while the R,R enantiomer of the nickel complex was used, the R,R enantiomer of the free phosphine results, with a change in the sign of the rotation. Crystallographic measurements, coupled with a measurement of optical rotation, confirmed the sign of rotation and configuration of the metal complex.Solute Weight Volume alpha alpha CH2Cl2 PhosphineNiBr2.CH2C12 1.124 mg 10.0 cm3 0.034 30 1.442 0.044 30Phosphine 9.120 0.163 17 6.481 0.115 17C.

USE IN ASSYMETRIC SYNTHESISExample 18Catalytic hydrogenation of methyl N benzoyl dehydrophenylalanine and N benzoyl dehydrophenylalanine The compound Rh 1,5 C8H12 C1 2 0.21g, 8.7 mmol in methanol was treated with S,S trans bis 1,2 diphenyiphosphine cyclopentane O.38g, 8.7 mmol and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes. The atmosphere was replaced with dihydrogen and methyl N benzoyl dehydrophenylalanine 0.122g, 0.43 mmol was added. The mixture was stirred for 12 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the acid ester was analysed for completeness of conversion. The product was dissolved in sodium hydroxide solution 1.OM, 5 cm3 and washed with chloroform 2 x 5 cm3 .The solution was then acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether 3 x 10 cm3 . The ethereal layers were washed with water 2 x 10 cm3 and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate. The solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the residue was submitted for determination of the optical rotation. The residue was also converted to the derivedN,N dimethylamide, as follows to a solution of the product acid 0.5 mmol in dichloromethane 7.5 cm3 was added oxalyl chloride 0.25g, 2 mmol with stirring. After 1 hour the solution was evaporated under reduced pressure and redissolved in dichloromethane 5 cm3 and evaporated again under reduced pressure. The residue was redissolved in dried dichloromethane and dimethylamine solution 70 , 2.5 cm4 was added slowly at OOC with stirring. After 5 minutes the layers were separated, the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride 2 x 5 cm3 , water 2 x 5 cm3 before drying over anhydrous potassium carbonate and removing the solvent under reduced pressure. In the proton n.m.r. spectrum CC14, 90 MHz in the presence of tris 3 heptafluorobutyryl d camphorato europium III the alpha Me doublets of the diastereomeric amide complexes are resolved delta 0.25ppm so that the product enantiomer excess is readily determined by integration of the separated isomers. The enantiomeric excess was found to be 100X.Example 19Catalytic hydrogenation of N benzoyl dehydrophenylalanine The procedure of Example 18 was repeated. The enantiomeric excess was found to be 100 .
