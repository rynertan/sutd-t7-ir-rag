## Description
DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to a container adapted to discharge at least some of its contents from a side of the container. This type of container will be hereinafter referred to as a side emptying container . The invention is particularly suitable for, but not restricted, to a container in the form of a loader bucket mounted forwardly of a suitable wheeled or. tracked conveyor vehicle. The bucket can have a forward digging lip, and is intended primarily for picking up, conveying and discharging earth, muck and particulate and granular material such as coal for example. A previously proposed side emptying bucket has a telescopic operating mechanism witfl slides and guides extending substantially beyond the full width of the bucket, and generally outside the outer rear profile of the bucket. An operating mechanism of these dimensions has the disadvantage that it takes up additional space and reduces the load carrying capacity of a bucket which is required to operate in a clearance or space of given size. It is an aim of the invention to alleviate this disadvantage, and accordingly there is provided a side emptying container having a discharge plate dimensioned to constitute a side wall of the container, and a ramdriven chain mechanism which is located within the full width and normal outer rear profile of the container, and is operable to move said discharge plate from one side to the other of thealtainerto discharge the contents thereof. The term dimensioned to constitute a side wall of the container11 means that the discharge plate is in close contact with the front, lower and rear walls of the container and extends from the front to the rear of the container interior. The discharge plate acts as a conventional side wall of the container when located at one side of the container, and is movable transversely across the container to discharge the contents thereof. By located within the full width and normal outer rear profile of the container is meant that the ram driven chain mechanism does not extend or project beyond the sides and rear of the container. In a preferred container of the invention the discharge plate is connected to a chain which is anchored at opposite ends to transversely spaced parts of the container and passes roun two transversely spaced rollers located between said two parts. In order to move the discharge plate across the container, the rollers are transversely driven in unison between said two points by a ram. In one construction the two rollers may be mounted on a slidable support member which is itself driven by the ram. One embodiment of a side emptying container of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accornpanying illustrative drawings in which FIGURE 1 is an end view of a loader bucket constituting a side emptying container, FIGURE 2 is a vertical sectional elevation through the centre of the bucket of Figure 1, and FIGURE 3 is a vertical sectional elevation through the centre of the bucket of Figure 1 with the bucket ram removed for clarity. Referring to the drawings, a loader bucket 1 has a semi elliptical profile which forms a rear and bottom wall. A digging lip 14 is mounted on the forward part of the bottom wall in order to dig into a muck pile when the bucket is rolled forwardly. The bucket profile is supported and rigidly maintained by stiffening plates 4 which are fitted to the outer skin of the bucket 1. The bucket 1 does not possess conventional side walls, but a single discharge plate 2 is fitted to the bucket and is arranged to be moved transversely across the bucket from one side to the other. The discharge plate 2 is moved across the bucket by means of a ram driven chain mechanism which includes a chain 5 anchored at its opposite ends to the two transversely spaced locations 11 and 12. The discharge plate 2 ws secured to a centre portion of the chain 5 which runs ifs a rectangular grooved track or tracks formed in the profile of the bucket 1. Tho chain is retained in the groove or grooves by retaining plates extending over the full width of the bucket 1. The two portions of the chain 5 on opposite sides of the d scharge plate 2 are passed around the transversely spaced rollers 9 and 10 respectively which are located between the locations 11 and 12.These rollers 9 and 10 are mounted on a slidable plate 13 which is held between rectangular grooves 7 and 8 which are themselves mounted at the bottom of the bucket 1 to form guides for the plate 13. A double acting hydraulic ram system 3 is contained within the full width of the bucket 1, and is operably connected to the slidable plate 13. This ram system may consist of one or more individual rams. Instead of a single chain 5 having the discharge plate 2 mounted at its intermediate region, the bucket may have two chains 5 with each chain extending between one of the anchoring locations 11 and 12 and one side of the discharge plate 2. The bucket 1 is mounted on a track or wheeled container of the type generally used with earth moving equipment. In operation the discharge plate 2 is positioned at one side of the bucket 1 with the bucket tilted forwardly to direct the digging lip 14 horizontally at a desired height from the ground, and the conveyor advances the bucket 1 into a muck pile. When the bucket 1 is loaded, the bucket is tilted rearwardly to its carry position, the conveyor moves to a discharge point, and the bucket 1 is raised to the discharge position. To discharge the contents of the bucket, the ram system 3 is actuated to move the plate 13 and hence the rollers 9 and 10 transversely across the bottom portion of the bucket.This transverse movement of the rollers 9 and 10 displaces the chain 5 so as to move the discharge plate 2 across the interior of the bucket 1. The configuration of the rollers 9 and 10 and the chain 5 ensures that a given transverse movement of the ram system 3 and the plate 13 produces a move nent through twice the distance of the discharge plate 2.This movement ratio assists considerably in ensuring that the ram driven chain mechanism is located within the full width.of the bucket , It is envisaged that the described and illustrated bucket will empty in a sideways direction efficiently and repetitively without persistent jamming of particles between the edge of the discharge plate 2 and the bucket inng profile This bucket also avoids the necessity for and consequent restrictions of a telescopic ram and guides which are positioned above the rear wall and which extend beyond the sides of the bucket. It is also envisaged that the described and illustrated bucket will discharge its contents to one or either side of the bucket without requiring additional vertical or horizontal clearance outside the bucket than is normally required for carrying a full load. This described and illustrated bucket is intended to be suitable for simple integration into a quick detachable system. The digging lip 74 may be specially shaped to suit specific digging or loading requirements, or alternatively to provide a mounting for various types of teeth which can be either fixed or vibratable. In a modiried embodiment the discharge plate 2 is located at right angles to the profile walls of the loader bucket 1 In the illustrated arrangement the discharge plate 2 is inclined at a desired critical angle to the bucket profile so that during the discharging movement of the discharge plate 2 the lower edge of the discharge plate is located forwardly of the upper edgeThis inclination of the discharge plate 2 causes its lower leading edge to be pressed firmly against the bottomwall of the bucket 1 when the discharge force is applied to the discharge plate. This firm pressure of the discharge plate lower edge against the bucket bottom wall assists in preventing particles fro bering trapped between the discharge plate and the bucket so as to i the discharge plate in the bucket An important preferred feature of the invention is that the ram driver. chain mechanism, applies the discharge force to the discharge plate 2 at the region of this plate where the greatest resistance of the bucket contents is concentrated. This provides support te the discharge plate 2 at this region, and reduces any deflection of the discharge plate which might cause the discharge plate to jam in the bucket .
