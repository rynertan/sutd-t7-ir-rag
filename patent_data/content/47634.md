## Description
SELF TACKING WRAP FILM The present invention relates to self tacking wrap film which is made of polypropylene composition, and more specifically, to self tacking wrap film suitable for use in electric microwave ovens. In general, self tacking wrap film is used for airtight wrapping of foods in homes, food shops, hotels and so on, for moisture proof wrapping of foods in the refrigerator or the electric microwave oven, and for keeping out objectionable smells and scents, and for keeping foods free from dust or the like in food shops. As a result of the popularization of the electric microwave ovens in recent years, self tacking wrap film has spread to its use for wrapping foods on a tray or the like.. Generally the tray is made of clay or glass, to prevent vapourization of moisture from the foodstuff and the release of smells in the elctric microwave oven. The self tacking wrap film which is thus used must have the property of tackiness with the tray and with the film itself, and also the property of low shrinkage from the heat of the electric microwave oven and non melting and non whitening from the heat. In conventional self tacking wrap film, it is well known that the main materials are polyvinylidene chloride, polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride. However, there are inherent disadvantages to their use. Film made of polyvinylidene chloride has the disadvantage of large shrinkage on heating. Film made of polyethylene the disadvantage of melting if in contact with oil used in fried meat or fish and heated to a high temperature.Furthermore, film made of polyvinyl chloride loses utility by whitening if it touches boiling water. Hence, of those conventional self tacking wrap films, each film has a disadvantage for use in the electric microwave oven. It is an object of the present invention to provide a self tacking wrap film which has better properties for use in an electric microwave oven. Other merits of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. According to the present invention the film is produced from a polypropylene resin composition whose residue of extraction with n heptane is from 95 wtM to 30 wt . The present invention will now be described in more detail. The polypropylene composition of the present invention, is mainly a polymer of propylene, and may include a copolymer of one or more a olefines for example, ethylene, butene, hexene and so on . In the present specification, the residue of extraction with n heptane is the value referred to as theIsotactic Index, used in the field of polypropylene. It is the value which is indicated by ratio between the whole weight of film before extraction and the weight of dried film that is left after boiling in n heptane for 24 hours in a Soxhlet extractor. The extracted part is mainly atactic polypropylene, but it is not limited to that and may contain other hydrocarbons, rosin, petroleum resin and so on. In the present specification, if the value of residue of extraction with n heptane is larger than 95 wt , that is the value of the extracted part is less than 5 wt , the tackiness or adhesiveness of the film to the tray made of clay or glass and to itself is weak. On the other hand, if the value of residue of extraction with n heptane is less than 30 wt , that is the extracted part is more than 70 wt , the film is too soft, and when the temperature as measured in the electric microwave oven test described in the Examples below is 1000C or less, the film is considered unsuitable for electric microwave oven use, In order to obtain the good applicability for electric microwave oven use, the film processing production is made from polypropylene resin composition in which the residue of extraction with n heptane is preferably from 90 wt to 60 wt . Polypropylene resin composition which is used in the present invention, and which the residue of extraction with n heptane is from 95 wt to 30 wt , is prepared by adding, if necessary, at least one additive selected from atactic polypropylene, petroleum resin, rosin and other olefines to polypropylene resin homopolymer or random copolymer or mixture thereof. Good results are obtained when the extracted part with n heptane is more than 5 wt or less than 70 wt . It can also contain conventional additives used in the film processing art. For example, antioxidànt, stabilizer, anti blocking agents and antistatic additives may be incorporated into the polypropylene resin composition as required. Lubricants are not suitable as they tend to reduce the property of self tackiness. Self tacking wrap film gives rise to the blocking phenomenon because transparency and self tackiness are required for the film. Blocking occurs when the film is wound around a cardboard tube, and the film has a tendency of tacking with itself so that it is difficult to peel it away. In the present invention, the composition may contain a surfactant for improving this property of the material in the production of the polypropylene resin composition or in the film production. In the present invention, it is preferred to use a surfactant such as glyceryl fatty acid having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms ester, sorbitan fatty acid C8 C22 ester, propylene glycol fatty acid C8 C22 ester, saccharose fatty acid C8 C22 ester, citric acid mono di or tri stearic acid ester, poly glycerol fatty acid C8 C18 ester, penta erythritol fatty acid C8 C18 ester, polyoxyethylene 20 glyceryl fatty acid C12 C18 ester, polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan fatty acid C12 C18 ester, polyethyleneglycol fatty acid C8 C22 ester, polypropylene glycol fatty acid C8 C18 ester, polyoxyethylene 9, 5 dodecyl ether, polyoxyethylene 4 14, 30 50 alkyl C4, 9, 12 phenyl ether, N, Nbis 2 hydroxy ethyl fatty acid C12 C18 amine, fatty acid C12 C18 amine, condensation products of fatty acid C12 C18 and di ethanolamine, polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block copolymer, polyethyleneglycol molecular weight from 200 to 9,500 , polypropylene glycol, alkyl C10 C20 sulfonate Na, K, NH4 salt, alkyl C9 C20 benzenesulfonate Na, K, NX4 salt, alkyl naphthalene sulfonate Na salt, sodium dialkyl C4, 5, 6, 8, 13 sulfo sacynate, alkyl C10 C2b sulfate Na, K, NH4 salt, potassium stearate, N acyl C8 C18 sarcosinate, and the like. In conventional usage, a compound from the fatty acid amide group is used for hindering blocking, but in the present invention, it may not be possible to use such amides in film production to inhibit self tackiness. In the present invention, the following techniques can be employed in order to improve the cutting property of film. The polypropylene resin composition may contain a property improving material known as a nucleating agent or agent for accelerating crystallization. It increases the temperature of crystallization by more than 20C. The following description concerns the improved cutting property of the film. Generally, the temperature of crystallization is measured by Differential ThermalAnalysis, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The temperature of crystallization in the present invention was measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry RIGAKU DENKI KOGYO products under the following measurement conditions. Pre treatment of test sample none Weight of test sample about 10 mg The rate of incr ease of temperature 100C min. Maximum temperature 250 C The rate of decrease of temperature 10 C min. Atmosphere a stream of nitrogen gas When measuring the temperature of the test sample with the above mentioned device and measuring conditions, first of all the melting peak is recognized, and in the next step, the temperature is increased to 250 C and where it turns to decreasing temperature, the peak of crystallization is noted. In the present invention, the temperature of crystallization is defined as the temperature at which said curve of crystallization is most distant from the base line. The crystallization temperature measured by this method indicates some variance according to the additives used. It is preferred to use effective nucleating agents such as aromatic and saturated fatty di carboxylic acid, benzoic acid, ring substituted benzoic acid, alicyclic carboxylic acid and metal salt thereof, cynamoic anhydr ide, thioglycolic anhydr ide, p toluene sulfonic acid, talc, sebacic acid, aluminium hydroxide, thio diglycolic anhydride, p ter butyl benzoic acid, p ter butyl benzoate aluminium salt, di benzylidene sorbitol, and the like. With these nucleating agents, the larger the amount added, the higher the temperature of crystallization becomes. Optimum results are obtained when these additives are applied to the composition only in an amount which increases the temperature of crystallization by more than 20C. When the temperature of crystallization was increased by less than 2 0C, appreciable improvement in the cutting property of the film could not be achieved. The amount of nucleating agent required to increase the temperature of crystallization by more than 20C varies according to the nature of the nucleating agent, but the value is usually from 0.01 to 1.0 wt . In the present invention, following technique can be employed in order to improve the cutting property of the film. The polypropylene resin composition may contain polyethylene, of which the average molecular weight is less than 30,000 and more than 500, in an amount from 2 to 40 wt . The polyethylene used in the present invention comprises resin of average molecular weight less than 30,000 and more than 500, and may contain a copolymer or mixture of one or more other a olefines. The average molecular weight can be determined by one of the several methods such as elevation of boiling point, or vapour pressure omometric method, but is not limited to any specific measuring method. So called polyethylene wax, that has a molecular weight less than 5,000, is produced by a process called the emulsion method, and can also be included as a component of the polypropylene resin composition. In this case, if the molecular weight of polyethylene wax is larger than 30,000, the mixture of resins have reduced compatibility, and in film production many slits occur in the film, so as to reduce its transparency.On the other hand, if the molecular weight is less than 500, the film does not have practical utility because of the poor cutting property of the film. The amount of polyethylene wax added leaves the cutting property of the film weak if less than 2 wt , whereas if it is over 40 wt , transparency, tackiness and its usefulness for electric microwave ovens is adversely affected. Good results can be obtained when the amount of added polyethylene wax is from 2 to 40 wt , and especially preferred is from 5 to 20 wt . Generally, polyethylene reduces the transparency of the film because of its poor compatibility with polypropylene, however, reducing the molecular weight improves compatibility and reduces the stress produced in cutting film with saw teeth.It was previously considered difficult to use conventional polypropylene as wrap film, but the reduction of the molecular weight of polyethylene enable its practical application for wrap film. Production methods for conventional polypropylene can be employed in the film production from the present polypropylene resin composition. For example, inflation film extrusion and T die film extrusion can be used in processing the film. The extrusion temperature is selected from 200 to 280 C. The polymer is extruded through a ring slit or plane slit, and may be quenched by water or on a cooling roller. The thickness of the film, which may be the same as the thickness of conventional wrap film, is in the range from 7 to 20p. Self tacking wrap film of the present invention has a good self tackiness for the ordinary uses of wrap film, and especially for its use in electric microwave ovens it has low shrinkage on heating, while at high temperatures it is resistant to melting or whitening. The following examples are intended to illustrate various embodiments of the present invention.
