# Foldable and portable bicycle pedal sprocket assembly.

## Abstract
A foldable, portable bicycle in which the handlebar, its elongated post, the seat assembly, the pedal crank and the frame are foldable quickly and easily into a compact and regular shaped package that is easily portable and storable, and are unfoldable with similar speed and ease into a safe, durable and comfortable bicycle that accommodates adults of normal size. The frame is designed with a low profile that is substantially the same in height and thickness as the dimensions of the wheels and their supports, and the handlebar and seat assemblies extend upwardly to normal height, but fold and collapse in novel ways, along with the pedals, to substantially within the confines outlined by the folded frame. Foldable pedal cranks are mounted on the crankshaft of the bicycle by male connectors on the opposite ends of the crankshaft in the form of lugs having opposite, parallel, generally radial sides on opposite sides of the crankshaft axis, and the inner end portions of the cranks are thickened and slotted on their laterally inner sides to form female connectors overlying the lugs. Pivots join the cranks to the lugs on the sides of the crankshaft axis opposite the outer end portions in the normal operating positions of the cranks, and snap engaging latches releasably engage the lugs to hold the cranks in place. For greater folded compactness, the cranks are inclined and offset laterally outwardly in the normal positions, to be reversed when folded, and to position the pedals for folding into the frame, each crank has a bend between its inner and outer end portions.
