# GLASS COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A glass which is highly resistant to corrosive attack in an alkaline medium, consisting essentially of from about 35 to about 10 percent silicon oxide from about 24 to about 10 percent oxides of iron from about 26 to about 70 percent calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, or mixtures thereof from about 5 to about 18 percent aluminum oxide and up to about 6 percent sodium oxide all percentages by weight . The glass is preferably prepared by combining slag pro duced by a municipal solid waste disposal plant with limestone or dolomite, and then forming a solid glass, as in the form of glass fibers. After the coating of the glass fibers with a bonding promoter, the fibers are advantageously employed as strengtheners in an alkali medium such as cement.
