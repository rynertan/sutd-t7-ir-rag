## Description
Microcarriers for culturing of anchorage dependent cellsThe present invention relates primarily to cell biology, in particular, to culturing of anchorage dependent cells on microcarriers in vitro.For a long time there has been a great interest and need for large scale culturing of primary human diploid cells and other anchorage dependent cells. One limiting factor has been the technical difficulties to obtain, by available techniques, an adequate yield of cells or products excreted from the cells. The classical methods for culturing of said cells are culturing in petri dishes, in roller bottles, on different types of fibres, etc. All of these methods have in common the features of the available area being limited, and of a large number of culturing vessels and large volumes of culturing media being needed at scaling up.Recently an alternative technology for culturing has been developed, which surmount these problems. By allowing the cells to grow on microspheres which altogether offer a very large area in a limited volume, the possibilities for scaling up have been quite altered. AL van Wezel describes in Nature 216 1967 p 64 a method for culturing of cells on beads of cross linked dextran having positive substituents. During the introductory work, when the technique using microcarriers was developed, commercially available ion exchangers of the type DEAE SephadexR Pharmacia Fine Chemicals were used.However, for high concentrations of microcarriers toxic effects were observed and the problem of eliminating these were discussed in a number of articles e.g.. by van Wezel inTissue Culture Methods and Applications, Academic Press, NewYork 1973 p 372 and by Horng and McLimans in BiotechnolBioeng 17 1975 p 713 . Levine et al discuss in SomaticCell Genetics 3 1977 p 149 the importance of the charge capacity of the microcarriers and they are of the opinion that an optimal product should have a diameter of 150 tim and a capacity of 2 meq g. The desire for a microcarrier having a charge capacity lower than that of DEAE SephadexR R led to developing of CytodexR 1 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals and SuperbeadsR Flow Laboratories .Both of these may be charac terized as low substitutedThe advantages of using beads of cross linked dextran and other swellable materials are obvious. They have a density g cm3 of 1.03 1.045, which in the water swollen state is negligibly different from the density of the aqueous milieu in which a cell culture is carried out. This is extremely important for culturing of microcarriers, as it is necessary to keep the particles moving without running the risk of tearing the cells off.Microcarriers synthesized from other organic polymers, such as polystyrene or polyacrylamide, have the drawback of being hydrophobic water repellant . Moreover they have a density requiring higher stirring speed, which negatively influences the adherence and growth of cells. In order to circumvent this drawback, such microcarriers have been made magnetic which decreases the required stirring speed. The distribution of particles the particle distribution should be as narrow as possible so as to achieve a uniform adherence and growth of the cells. Usually a particle size in the range of 150 300 jim is used. It is also of importance that this narrow particle distribution is obtained before the charged substituent is attached. Otherwise a non uniform charge distribution will be obtained, which might lead to a non uniform anchorage of the cells.Moreover the particles should be transparent, which makes microscopying of growing cultures easier.The uptake of components from the culturing medium, other than those contributing to anchoring and possibly also to growth, should be negligible. The particles must be non toxic for primary cells, established cell lines and strains of diploid cells from humans and animals. Moreover, it is necessary that there is no leakage of toxic substances occurring from the microcarrier.However, in spite of all their advantages, the previously used types of microcarriers have not been found to fulfil all the criteria for a perfect microcarrier being concluded above.The known microcarriers being based on beads of cross linked dextran SuperbeadsR and CytodexR 1 or polyacrylamide BiocarriersR from BlO RAD Laboratories contain the substituents CH2 2 N C2H5 2 or CH2 3 N CH3 2 respectively.For a long time it has been known that there is a further reaction taking place in the synthesis of polymers with tertiary amines Ahrgren et al Polymeric Amines and AmmoniumSalts, Ed Goethals, Pergamon Press, Oxford and New York, 1980 , which may be illustrated in the following reaction diagramEMI3.1 tb P SEP SEP 0 SEP SEP CH2 2 SEP SEP N C2H5 2 SEP SEP Cl CH2 2N C2H5 2 SEP tb SEP SEP P SEP SEP 0 SEP SEP CH2 2 SEP SEP N SEP C2H5 2 SEP SEP CH2 2 SEP SEP N C2H5 2 SEP tb where P is the polymer.It is also known that quarternary a mines are degraded at certain conditions Hoffman degradation , In particular if they contain the so called beta hydrogens beta elimination is obtained, which in said three microcarriers results in an alkylating compound which is toxic C.J. Soper et al J Pharmacol Suppl Br Pharm Conf 1979, 31 1979 p 67 . According to the present invention, it has now been found that this drawback of previous microcarriers can be circumvented, if a polymeric carrier being substituted with quarternary amino groups is used as a microcarrier and said polymeric carrier being characterized in that the quarternary amino groups have the formulaEMI4.1 where Z is a possibly substituted hydrocarbon chain having at least two carbon atoms R1, R2 and R3, which may be identical or different, may be lower alkyl groups of 1 5 carbon atoms or lower hydroxy alkyl groups of 2 5 carbon atoms and 1 2 hydroxy groups, at most one atom other than carbon and hydrogen being bound to one and the same carbon atom in the hydroxyalkyl group and at most one of R1 R3 being an alkyl group of 1 20 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon chain Z may be straight, branched or cyclic and may possibly be substituted with one or more e.g.1 3 hydroxyl groups and possibly be broken by one or more e.g. 1 3 oxygen atoms, at most one atom other than carbon and hydrogen being bound to one and the same carbon atom. The number of carbon atoms in Z are preferably 2 20, e.g. 2 10. Z is preferably CH2 CH OH CH2. Z is preferably bound by ether bonds to the polymeric carrier.In one preferred embodiment the quarternary amino groups have the formula O CH2 CH OH CH2 N CH3 3. Counter ions to said quarternary amino groups may be inorganic or organic negative ions, which are not toxic for the cells, e.g. chloride ions or sulphate ions, or negative ions of non toxic organic acids.Those polymeric matrices being known from chromatography are advantageously used as carriers. Examples thereof are crosslinked dextran, polyacrylamide, agarose, polystyrene, etc.The previously mentioned advantageous properties of crosslinked dextran make it particularly suitable as a carrier.The synthesis of polymeric matrices is well known. Moreover, it is well known that they may be obtained in form of small spherical particles by the so called bead polymerization.According to the invention, it is preferable that the total charge capacity of the microcarriers is in the range of 0.3 2.0 meq g by product with chloride as a counter ion .Microcarriers according to the invention may be prepared by known technique, analogously to that described in US PatentSpecification No 3 277 025.Moreover, it has, according to the invention, been shown that an optimum of cell yield is achieved at a total charge capacity of 0.5 0.8 meq g dry product with chloride as a counter ion , the charge being localized to an outer layer of the microcarrier corresponding to about 20 30 of the radius of the microcarrier in the swollen state. Thereby, microcarriers of different charge capacities may obtain substantially the same charge density calculated per volume unit in the substituted layer. It is of importance that the substituted layer occupies a certain part of the radius.By localizing the charge to the surface a further advantage is a a considerable reduction in the adsorption of components either added to or excreted by the cells by ion exchange. According to one embodiment of the invention, the localization of the charge to the surface of microcarriers is accomplished by reacting the waterswellable microcarriers, in the presence of a suitable solvent and therefore in an unswollen state, with a compound in order to introduce the group EMI6.1 Where Z, R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings given above. Corresponding reactions involving hydrophobic microcarriers, are carried out in a hydrophilic solvent.The invention will be further illustrated by the following working examples, which do not limit the invention. Example 1 5 g of cross linked beaded dextran type SephadexR G 50,Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB, Uppsala, Sweden of bead size 60 87 was suspended in 10 ml 95 ethanol in a vessel of 50 ml equipped with a stirrer and a refluxer. Thereafter 12 g glycidyl trimethyl ammonium chloride was added and the mixture was heated to 60 OC followed by addition of 7.5 ml triethylamine. After 6 hours the mixture was cooled to room temperature and suspended in 5 x 150 ml 0.9 sodium chloride solution. The yield was 5 g of a surface substituted bead of cross linked dextran having a total capacity of 0.60 meq g.About 10 g of this dry microcarrier was swollen in water on a glass filter. 3 drops of a 10 sodium hydroxide solution were added and the mixture was washed in distilled water to neutral reaction. 2 mg FITC dextran was dissolved in 2 ml water and added. FITC dextran is a soluble dextran of molecular weight 10 000 to which fluorescein isothiocyanate is covalently bound as a ligand. The mixture was equillibrated for 10 minutes and was then washed with water. This coloured microcarrier was placed on an object glass and examined in a fluorescence microscope. Thereby it was established that the charge was localized to a layer corresponding to 20 of the radius of the microcarrier in the swollen state.Example 2 1 x 105 VERO cells ml VERO cells are an established cell line from the kidney of African green monkey, and are commercially available from Flow Laboratories Ltd., England were incubated with 2 g l of autoclaved microcarrier in growth medium Dulbecco1 s modified Eagle s medium containing 4 mM glutamine and 10 foetal calf serum from Flow Laboratories at 37 OC with 5 CO2 and a humidity of 95 . As a microcarrier those prepared according to example 1 and others of different total capacities synthesized in the same way were used. The cells were counted according to Sanford et al J Natal CancerInst 11, 737, 1951 after 55 hours in culture. Capacity Cells meq g per ml 0.16 4.2 x 104 0.51 9.2 x 104 0.60 1.0 x 105 0.74 1.0 x 105 0.89 8.2 x 104 Example 3 105 VERO cells ml were incubated, according to example 2, with the microcarrier according to example 1. The suspension was stirred and the cells were counted as above at different time intervals.Time h Cells ml 22 4.6 x 104 64 1.0 x 105 134 4.4 x 105 186 5.6 x 280 1.4 x 106Example 4Autoclaved microcarriers, prepared according to example 1 but having a total capacity of 0.54 meq g were incubated with 2 x 105 MRC 5 cells ml as in example 2 MRC 5 is an established cell line of limited life time, originating from humanlung fibroblasts and being available from Flow Laboratories .After an initial stationary culture for 24 hours the suspension was stirred. Samples were collected after the time intervals given below and the cells were counted in the same way as given in example 2. Time h Cells ml 5 1.4 x 105 24 3.0 x 105 48 5.2 x 105 72 5.6 x 105 The examples 2 4 very clearlypoint out that microcarriers, according to the invention, result in a growth being as good as that one obtained by microcarriers previously known. Example 5Cultures of monkey kidney cells were washed with medium 199 from Flow Laboratories after 7 days in culture. Proteins were detected by counter electrophoresis.Culturing was separately carried out on both CytodexR 1 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals AB and on the surface substituted microcarrier prepared as in example 1.This experiment showed that, after one washing of each type of microcarrier by equal volumes of medium 199, the supernatant from the microcarrier described in example 1 only contained 1 8 of the albumin content and 1 4 of the IgG content, which could be detected in the supernatant from CytodexR 1.This prove that microcarriers according to the invention adsorb considerably less proteins than the microcarriers previously known.
