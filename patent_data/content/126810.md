# Process for carbothermic reduction of alumina.

## Abstract
In a carbothermic process for producing aluminum, alumina and carbon are reacted in a furnace to produce aluminum contaminated with aluminum carbide. A charge material 28 including carbon is subjected to back reactions of vapors and gases passing upwardly therethrough and is transferred to the hearth 13 of the furnace 10 where it reacts with a molten slag layer 23 containing alumina to produce an aluminum product as a separate liquid layer 25 . At least part of the alumina necessary to form the aluminum product may be supplied to the hearth without being subjected to the back reactions, for example by being transferred with slag 38 from a secondary decarbonizing furnace 30 to which alumina is directly fed. The reduction reaction on the hearth 13 may result in an aluminum product having a carbide content of 20 37 , which can be reduced to 4 15 in a subsequent reaction on the same hearth in the absence of both reactive carbon and of solid aluminum carbide, and still further to about 2 in the secondary furnace 30 .
