# Heated fuel line.

## Abstract
A heated fuel line for preventing solidifying of fuel in the fuel line of an engine in extremely low temperature environ ments includes an electrical resistance heating element 16 positioned directly inside the fuel line 10 . A thin, tape like heating element is preferably employed through the length of the fuel line between the tank and the connection to a fuel filter 12 near the engine. Lead wires 17 extend from the downstream end of the heating element th rough afitting 18 which carries the leads to the exterior of the fuel line. The heating element is preferably of a type including a pair of spaced conductor wires 25 covered with an separated by a sheath of a radiation cross linked polymer which has the property of becoming more conductive in lower tempera tures and less conductive in higher temperatures. At lower temperatures where heating of the fuel in the line is most needed, the element 16 therefore produces the greatest amount of heat.
