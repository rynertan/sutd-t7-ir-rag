## Description
NONAQUEOUS CELLS EMPLOYING HEAT TREATED MnOCATHODES AND A PROPYLENE CARBONATE DIMETHOX ETHANE LITHIUM TRIFLUOROMETHANE SULFONATE ELECTROLYTE The invention relates to a nonaqueous cell utilizing a highly active metal anode, a manganese dioxide containing cathode which contains less than about 1 percent water based on the weight of the manganese dioxide and a liquid organic electrolyte solution comprising lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate dissolved in propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. The development of high energy battery systems requires the compatibility of an electrolyte possessing desirable electrochemical properties with highly reactive anode materials, such as lithium, sodium, and the like and the efficient use of high energy density cathode materials, such as manganese dioxide. The use of aqueous electrolytes is precluded in these systems since the anode materials are sufficiently active to react with water chemically. It has therefore been necessary, in order to realize the high energy density obtainable through use of these highly reactive anodes and high energy density cathodes, to turn to the investigation of nonaqueous electrolyte systems and more particularly to nonaqueous organic systems. The term nonaqueous organic electrolyte in the prior art refers to an electrolyte which is composed of a solute, for example, a salt or complex salt of Group 1 A, Group II A or Group III A elements of the Periodic Table, dissolved in an appropriate nonaqueous organic solvent. Conventional solvents include propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate or Y butyrolactone. A multitude of solutes is known and recommended for use but the selection of a suitable solvent has been particularly troublesome since many of those solvents which are used to prepare electrolytes sufficiently conductive to permit effective ion migration through the solution are reactive with the highly active anodes mentioned above.Most investigators in this area, in search of suitable solvents, have concentrated on aliphatic and aromatic nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds with some attention given to organic sulfur , phosphorus and arsenic containing compounds. The results of this search have not been entirely satisfactory since many of the solvents investigated still could not be used effectively with high energy density cathode materials, such as manganese dioxide MnO2 , and were sufficiently corrosive to lithium anodes to prevent efficient performance over any length of time. Although manganese dioxide has been mentioned as a cathode for cell applications, manganese dioxide inherently contains an unacceptable amount of water, both of the adsorbed and bound absorbed types, which is sufficient to cause anode lithium corrosion along with its associated hydrogen evolution. This type of corrosion that causes gas evolution is a serious problem in sealed cells, particularly in miniature type button cells. In order to maintain overall batterypowered electronic devices as compact as possible, the electronic devices are usually designed with cavities to accommodate the miniature cells as their power source. The cavities are usually made so that a cell can be snugly positioned therein thus making electronic contact with appropriate terminals within the device.A major potential problem in the use of cell powered devices of this nature is that if the gas evolution causes the cell to bulge then the cell could become wedged within the cavity. This could result in damage to the device.Also, if electrolyte leaks from the cell it could cause damage to the device. It is therefore important that the physical dimensions of the cell s housing remain constant during discharge and that the cell will not leak any electrolyte into the device being powered. Consequently, the manganese dioxide for use in this invention has to be heat treated to lower its water content to less that 1 percent by weight as is known in the battery art. U.S. Patent 4,133,856 discloses a process for producing a Mn02 electrode cathode for nonaqueous cells whereby the MnO2 is initially heated within a range of 3500 to 4300C so as to substantially remove both the adsorbed and bound water and then, after being formed into an electrode with a conductive agent and binder it is further heated in a range of 2000 to 3500C prior to its assembly into a cell.British Patent 1,199,426 also discloses the heat treatment of MnO2 in air at 2500 to 4500C to substantially remove its water component. Propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane have been employed as solvents for a wide range of solutes as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,158,723. Specifically, this patent discloses a Li PbO cell containing Bi203, Sb203 or SnO2 additive in the PbO cathode and an electrolyte of a mixture of an ether e.g. dimethoxyethane and an ester e.g. propylene carbonate with a solute such as lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate. While the theoretical energy, i.e., the electrical energy potentially available from a selected anode cathode couple, is relatively easy to calculate, there is a need to choose a nonaqueous electrolyte for a couple that permits the actual energy produced by an assembled battery to approach the theoretical energy. The problem usually encountered is that it is practically impossible to predict in advance how well, if at all, a nonaqueous electrolyte will function with a selected couple. Thus a cell must be considered as a unit having three parts a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte, and it is to be understood that the parts of one cell are not predictably interchangeable with parts of another cell to produce an efficient and workable cell. It is an object of the present invention to provide a nonaqueous cell employing among other components a manganese dioxidecontaining cathode wherein the water content is less than 1 weight percent based on the weight of the manganese dioxide and a stable electrolyte solution of lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate dissolved in propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane which permits excellent cathode utilization over a wide range of temperatures. It is another object of the present invention to provide a heat treated manganese dioxide nonaqueous cell employing a lithium anode. It is another object of the present invention to provide a lithium MnO2 nonaqueous cell employing a liquid organic electrolyte consisting of lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate dissolved in propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. The invention provides a novel high energy density nonaqueous cell comprising a highly active metal anode, a manganese dioxidecontaining cathode wherein the manganese dioxide has a water content of less than 1 weight percent based on the weight of the manganese dioxide and a liquid organic electrolyte comprising lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate dissolved in propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. Preferably the water content should be bower than 0.5 weight percent and most preferably below about 0.2 weight percent. The water inherently contained in both electrolytic and chemical types of manganese dioxide can be substantially removed by various treatments. For example, the manganese dioxide can be heated in air or an inert atmosphere at a temperature of 350 C for about 8 hours or at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Care should be taken to avoid heating the manganese dioxide above its decomposition temperature which is about 4000C in air. In oxygen atmospheres, higher temperatures may be employed. In accordance with this invention the manganese dioxide should be heated for a sufficient period of time to insure that the water content is reduced below about 1 weight percent, preferably below about 0.5 and most preferably below about 0.2 weight percent based on the weight of the manganese dioxide.An amount of water above about 1 weight percent would react with the highly active metal anode, such as lithium, and cause it to corrode thereby resulting in hydrogen evolution. As stated above, this could result in physical distortion of the cell and or electrolyte leakage from the cell during storage or discharge. To effectively remove the undesirable water from MnO2, or Mnz mixed with a conductive agent and a suitable binder, to the level necessary to practise this invention, it is believed necessary that both the adsorbed and bound water be substantially removed. After the water removal treatment has been completed, it is essential that the manganese dioxide be shielded to prevent adsorption of water from the atmosphere. This could be accomplished by handling the treated manganese dioxide in a dry box or the like. Alternatively, the treated manganese dioxide combined with a conductive agent and a suitable binder could be heat treated to remove water that could have been adsorbed from the atmosphere. Preferably, the manganese dioxide should be heat treated to remove its water content to below about 1 weight percent and then it can be mixed with a conductive agent such as graphite, carbon or the like and a binder such as Teflon trademark for polytetrafluoroethylene , ethylene acrylic acid copolymer or the like to produce a solid cathode.If desired, a small amount of the electrolyte can be incorporated into the manganese dioxide mix. An added possible benefit in the removal of substantially all the water from manganese dioxide is that if small amounts of water are present in the cell s electrolyte then the manganese dioxide will adsorb the main portion of that water from the electrolyte and thereby prevent or substantially delay the reaction of the water with the anode such as lithium. In this situation, the manganese dioxide will act as an extracting agent for the water impurities in the organic solvents. The specific electrolyte of this invention propylene carbonate PC dimethoxyethane DME LiCF3SO3 has been found to be an extremely stable electrolyte for lithium cells that permits excellent manganese dioxide utilization over a wide temperature range. Although there are hundreds of electrolyte solutions for use in nonaqueous cell systems, many will not provide efficient cathode utilization over a wide range of temperatures and many will not efficiently function with manganese dioxide containing cathodes. The conductivity of electrolyte.solutions decreases as the temperature decreases and thus many electrolyte solutions can function efficiently only at room temperature and above. To compensate for low temperature environments, additives have sometimes been used in electrolyte solutions to render the solutions more conductive. Since nonaqueous cells are rather delicate electrochemical systems, any additives, although improving one aspect of the system, may be detrimental to another aspect of the system. The electrolyte solution of the present invention has been found to efficiently work over a wide range of temperatures with heat treated manganese dioxide cathodes and lithium anodes. The ratio of propylene carbonate to dimethoxyethane based on the solvent volume can vary from about 80 20 to 20 80 and is preferably about 50 50. The lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate can vary from about 0.5 molar up to its saturation in the electrolyte solution and preferably is about 1 molar concentration. Generally, the conductivity should be at least 10 4 ohm 1 cm 1. Highly active metal anodes suitable for this invention include lithium Li , potassium K , sodium Na , calcium Ca , magnesium Mg , aluminum Al , and their alloys. Of these active metals, lithium would be preferred because in addition to being a ductile, soft metal that can easily be assembled in a cell, it possesses the highest energy to weight ratio of the group of suitable anode metals.
