# Bootstrap driver circuits for a MOS memory.

## Abstract
A high speed, low power bootstrap driver is disclosed for use in an MOS memory. The basic driver includes first and second enhancement mode transistors 12a, 14a for receiving a digital input 16a . The drain of the first transistor 12a is coupled to a high impedance depletion mode transistor 22a , and the drain of the latter transistor is coupled to the source of a low impedance transistor 26a . Another enhancement mode transistor 30a is coupled via its sources to the drain of the second enhancement mode transistor 14a and is coupled via its gate to the drain of the first enhancement mode transistor 12a . A capacitor 34a is connected between the drain of the high impedance transistor 22a and the drain of the second enhancement mode transistor 14a . When a low level input is received, the drain of the first enhancement mode transistor 12a is rapidly bootstrapped to a high level voltage above the positive power supply for use as an output signal 18a . Delay means, such as an inverter 46, 48 , are arranged to receive the input signal and apply a delayed input signal to the gates of said first and second enhancement mode transistors 12a, 14a .
