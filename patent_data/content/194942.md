# Apparatus to transform a single frequency, linearly polarized laser beam into a beam with two, orthogonally polarized frequencies.

## Abstract
An electro optical apparatus transforms a single stabil ized frequency, linearly polarized laser input beam 18 from a light source 10 into an output beam 46 having two orthogonal polarization components of different frequency. The input beam 18 is provided to an acousto optic Bragg cell 20 which is driven by the output of an electrical oscillator 30 which provides the Bragg cell 20 with a frequency stabilized electrical signal 32 comprised of two different frequencies. The Bragg cell 20 transforms the input beam 18 into two intermediate beams having the same linear polarization as the input beam 18 but whose directions of propagation and frequencies differ from the input beam 18 and which are at one half the intensity of the input beam 18 . The Bragg cell 20 output is provided to a birefringent prism 44 which splits the intermediate beams into the two orthogonal polarization components of the output beam 46 , at one half the intensity of the input beam 18 , and two spurious beams which are eliminated.
