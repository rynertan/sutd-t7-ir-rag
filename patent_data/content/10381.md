# Regeneration of activated carbon.

## Abstract
A method of regenerating an activated carbon which has had its collecting capacity for gold adsorption reduced through use which includes the step of contacting the carbon with an aqueous copper salt solution having a pH of less than 6. The regeneration is improved if the solution contains car bonic acid or if the copper salt solution treatment is followed by treatment with a carbonate or bicarbonate solution.
