# A system and method for defining and displaying an image for photographic reproduction.

## Abstract
Apparatus and method for making and photographing computer graphic colored images by defining each computer graphic color image as a plurality of constant color pixel groups, assigning one of a preselected number of colors to each constant color pixel group, assigning one of a pre selected number of foreground background numbers to each constant color pixel group so as to designate its location with respect to the other constant color pixel groups, and exposing a photosensitive material to each constant color pixel group displayed in a predetermined ordered sequence and color so as to maintain the predetermined ordered foreground to background relationship of the constant color pixel groups in the exposure of the photosensitive material to the overlapping areas between the constant color pixel groups.
