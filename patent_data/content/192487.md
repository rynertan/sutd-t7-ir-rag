# Vessel opening top inspection apparatus.

## Abstract
A vessel opening top inspection apparatus which can accurately detect presence or absence of an overpress finish of a vessel such as a bottle comprises a projector 4 , an image sensor 5 , a memory 6 , a top detecting means 7 including a top width detecting means 9a and a width judging means 9b , and an overpress finish detecting means 8 . Light projected by the projector and reflected from an opening top 2 of a vessel 1 in position for inspection is received by the image sensor outputs of cells of which are stored as digital amounts individually into cells of the memory specified by corresponding addresses whereafter the digital amounts are judged one after another to detect the opening top and then the digital amounts are judged one after another for addresses after such detection to detect presence or absence of an overpress finish on the vessel depending upon the magnitude of the digital amounts.
