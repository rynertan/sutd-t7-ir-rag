# Cathode ray tube device with improved color filtering system.

## Abstract
Halos occurring around bright light spots generated by cathode ray tube devices in which the light emitted by the tubes is filtered by filtering solutions are significantly reduced by the addition of cinnamic alcohol and or cinna maldehyde to the solution.
