## Description
METHOD OF EXPRESSING ALPHA 1 ANTITRYPSIN IN BACTERIA AND ITS USE IN THERAPEUTIC FORMULATIONS, AND VECTORS AND BACTERIA FOR SUCH METHOD AND THEIR PRODUCTIONThe present invention is directed to a method of expressing mammalian alpha l antitrypsin in bacteria and to the protein product expressed thereby.Alpha l antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor present in mammalian blood whose apparently major physiological function is to inhibit elastase, a potent protease which hydrolyzes structural proteins. The alpha l antitrypsin also inhibits other serine proteases. The normal plasma level of alpha l antitrypsin is about 2 mg. ml. A low level of alpha l antitrypsin in the blood may be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary emphysema and infantile liver cirrhosis. Under many inflammatory conditions an acute phase response is initiated and the concentration of alpha l antitrypsin is substantially increased. In order to study and treat alpha l anti trypsin deficiency and to examine the mechanism of acute phase response, it is therefore desirable to have a pure alpha l antitrypsin protein.In particular, it is desirable to have a source of antitrypsin protein produced by bacteria through genetic engineering techniques.It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing alpha l antitrypsin in bacteria. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a pure alpha l antitrypsin polypeptide which has been produced in bacteria by genetic engineering techniques.In the accompanying figures FIG. 1 is a diagram of the steps for converting the vector M13 mplO to a linear fragment adapted to receive the trp lac promotor.FIG. 2 is a diagram of the steps for isolating the trp lac promotor fragment from plasmid pDR54O. FIG. 3 is a diagram of the steps for fusing the final fragments from FIGs. 1 and 2 and converting same to vector ml3TAC.FIG. 4 is a diagram of gene coding for the predominant form of human alpha l antitrypsin.FIG. 5A is the polylinker DNA sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence at the start of the lacZ gene in pUC13. FIG. 5B is the restriction map of plasmid pUC alpha l.FIG. 6 is a restriction map of plasmid M131AT. FIG. 7 shows the results of the elastase binding assay of lacZ a1AT fusion protein prepared according to Example 3.The sequencing of chromosomal DNA cDNA coding for alpha l antitrypsin has been described by Kurachi et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A., 78, 6826 6830 1981 and byChandra et al., Biochem.Biophys.Res.Comm., 103, 751 758 1981 , the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. A primate gene for alpha l antitrypsin may be obtained by DNA cloning methods described byChandra et al., ibid. Also, the gene coding for the predominant form of human alpha l antitrypsin, isolated from a human cDNA library is shown in FIG. 4.The present invention is directed to a method for producing alpha l antitrypsin hereinafter AT in bacteria by inserting a cDNA coding sequence for AT into an expression vector, which, in bacteria, will express a polypeptide having the protease inhibition activity of mammalian AT. The DNA transfer vectors contain, in addition to the cDNA coding segment for mammalian AT, appropriately positioned translational start and stop signals and may contain promoter segments and genes for phenotypic selection. The cDNA segments containing coding sequences for alpha l antitrypsin are known as described above. Preferably the gene coding for the predominant form of human alpha l antitrypsin may be utilized, the sequence of which is set forth in accompanying FIG. 4.However, the expression of less antigenic and or more stable mutant forms of AT may also be useful particularly for subjects having variant forms ofAT. The predominant human AT coding sequence may be isolated from a cDNA library by using the baboon AT gene Kurachi, et al., ibid. as a hybridization probe.Preferred vectors according to the present invention may be derived from the M13 cloning vectors, described byMessing, Methods in Enzymology, 101 1983 . A particularly preferred vector is phage M13 mplO, described byMessing et al., ibid, and commercially available from P LBiochemicals. This vector contains EcoRl and BamHI restriction sites in the linker sequence, and a uniqueAvaII site in the lacI region. To enhance the expression of AT by this vector in bacteria, M13 mplO is modified by insertion of a hybrid trp lac promoter obtainable from the plasmid pDR540. This latter plasmid is described by Russell et al., Gene, 20, 231 243 1982 and is commercially available from P L Biochemicals.Referring to FIG. 1, the preferred DNA transfer vector according to the present invention is prepared by digesting the phage M13 mplO with EcoRI and BamHI. A synthetic DNA adaptor, purchased from P L Biochemicals, having the following structure and lacking the five prime phosphates AATTCATGGAG GTACCTCCTAG is ligated onto the resultant sticky ends to form the construct mplOA shown in FIG. 1. The construct mplOA thus contains EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites about a sequence including ATGGAG which provides the initiation codon and the first amino acid Glu codon for the AT gene. The substitution of the adaptor for the region between the original EcoRI and BamHI sites of mplO destroys the lac operon reading frame and the resulting transfectants give white plaques.The vector mplA is digested with AvaII and the sticky ends filled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase.This is followed by digestion with EcoRI, and removal of the sticky end using S1 nuclease. The resultant blunt ended fragment is shown in FIG. 1 as mplB. Referring to FIG. 2, a DNA fragment comprising the trp lac promoter is removed from pDR540. The plasmid pDR540 is cut with HindIII and the sticky ends are filled with Klenow polymerase. Linkers having the sequence CCTCGAGG are ligated to the blunt ends and excess linkers are removed by digestion with XhoI. The resulting construct, known as pDR54X, contains an XhoI site in place of the HindIII site of pDR54. Digesting pDR54X with XhoI and BamHI, followed by blunting the ends using Klenow fragment, yields a fragment containing the trp lac promoter TAC and Shine Dalgarno sequence. Referring to FIG. 3, the above described fragment containing the trp lac promoter is inserted into the mpleB fragment the final construct shown in FIG. 1 , producing the hybrid phage mplBC, Ligation of the blunted Avail end of mpleB to the blunted XhoI end of the TAC containing fragment regenerates an XhoI site at the junction. Ligation of the blunted BamHI site of theTAC fragment to the blunted EcoRI end of mplB creates an NcoI site CCATGG at this junction. The proper orientation of the fragment may be screened for by the formation of blue plaques. The phage mplOC contains a second BamHI site located upstream of the ATG initiation codon which must be removed to facilitate insertion of the AT gene into the original BamHI site.To remove this extraneous BamHI site, mplOC is subjected to two digestions with BamHI. The first, a partial digestion, is followed by filling in the sticky ends with Klenow polymerase, digesting with XhoI, and purifying on an agarose gel. The proper fragment is identified as the one containing the NcoI restriction site. The secondBamHI digestion of mplOC is run to completion, the sticky ends are filled using Klenow polymerase and 32P dNTP s are used to facilitate monitoring of subsequent manicuring of the blunt ends by Bal 31 exonuclease. Five base pairs are removed from the labeled terminus by Bal 31 exonuclease, thereby eliminating the BamHI site. The sequence containing the promoter is removed with XhoI and gel purified. The mplO and pDR54Q derived fragments are ligated together, cloned into E.coli K12 JM103 Messing, J. et al. 1981.Nucleic Acids Res. 9 309, commercially available fromP L Biochemicals and screened for NcoI sensitivity and formation of blue plaques. The resulting vector, shown in FIG. 3, is M13 TAC.The AT sequence of FIG. 4 is flanked by PstI restriction sites as a result of being cloned into the PstI site of pBR322 Kurachi, et al., ibid. . The AT gene may, therefore, be removed as a PstI fragment of approximately 1446 base pairs and may be inserted into the plasmid pUC13 pUC13 is constructed as described for pUC8 and pUC9 in Messing, Meth. in Enz ymo logy , 101, 1983 , but containing the polylinker sequence shown inFIG. 5A at the start of the lacZ gene see also Vieira and Messing, Gene 19, 259 268, 1982 the disclosure of which are incorporated by reference herein , to produce the plasmid pUC al FIG. 5B . pUC al is digested withPstI and BamHI to produce a fragment containing AT coding sequences which may be inserted into aBamHI PstI digested M13 TAC vector.The protein expressed by the resulting recombinant phage starts with aMet followed by the sequence of mature AT. The recombinant phage may be used to transfect E.coli K12 JM103 . The cells are grown, infected, and induced according to the method of Slocombe et al., PNAS U.S.A., 79, 5455 1982 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Samples are collected at various times after induction and the cells harvested by a low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 1 20 volume of 50 mM tris pH 8.0, 30 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA. The supernatant is assayed for extracellular phage, and lysozyme is added to the bacterial suspension to a final concentration of 1 mg. ml. After 30 minutes at 40C, the bacteria are lysed by several cycles of freeze thaw and the cell debris is removed by centrifugation dt 100,000 xg for 1 hour.The supernatant is treated with DNAse, and assayed for AT by ELISA and elastase binding assay. EXAMPLE 1 ELISA Assay for ATTo assay for AT, 200 microliters of goat anti alpha lantitrypsin 10 micrograms ml in 0.1M Nazi03 pH 9.8 that has been affinity purified is placed in each well of a 96 well microtiter culture plate at 370C for two to four hours. This solution is removed and 200 microliters of phosphate buffered saline PBS pH 7.2 containing 1 BSA and .05 Tween 20 is added to each well at 370C for two hours.Test samples, including standards, are then added to each well and AT, if present, binds to the specific antibody.

After rinsing the wells, 200 microliters of a substrate solution was added which contains 30 milligrams of dinitrophenyl phosphate dissolved in 50 ml of 0.1 m diethanolamine pH 9.6. A yellow color is allowed to develop 15 60 minutes and intensity is recorded at 405 nm on a Titertek Multiscan detector. The yellow color is proportional to the amount of AT in the test solution.

EXAMPLE 3 Expression of a lacZ alAT fusion proteinPlasmid pUCal FIG. 5B is digested with BAM H1 and PST 1 and the 1320 bp fragment is purified from an agarose gel Anal. Biochem. 103, 264 1980 . This fragment is ligated into M13mplO which had also been digested withBAM H1 and PST1. The resulting construction, M13a1AT, is shown in FIG. 6.Following the protocol of Slocombe et al., ibid., E.coli K12 JM103 is grown, infected with M13alAT and induced as described therein. Samples are collected at various times after induction and the cells are harvested by a low speed centrifugation and resuspended inl 20 volume of 50mM Tris pH 8.0, 30 mM NaCl and 10 mMEDTA. The supernatant is assayed for extracellular phage. Lysozyme is added to the bacterial suspension to a final concentration of 1 mg ml. After 30 min. at 4 C the bacteria are lysed by several cycles of freezethawing and the cell debris is removed by centrifugation at 100,000 xg for one hour. The supernatant is assayed for alAT by ELISA and elastase binding assay following the procedures of Examples 1 and 2, respectively. The ELISA as says in Table I show that the culture with the expression vector but without the gene for a 1AT JM103 does not produce any a 1AT. Two cultures of JM13 containing the M13alAT expression vector expressed 0.86 and .188 AT.Vector M13a1AT was deposited on 8th August 1984 withAmerican Type Culture Collections ATCC of 12301Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland 20852, U.S.A.

The column is washed extensively with phosphate buffered saline PBS , pH 7.2, containing .5 M Nazi. Any specifically immunoadsorbed material is then eluted from the column with 3M NaSCN. This material is dialyzed against PBS to remove the salt and then subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol. The results indicate that the a1AT expressed in E. coli is purified to homogeneity as a single polypeptide chain indicating that the expressed product is stable. In comparison to a1AT expressed in yeast Ser.No. 489,406, filed April 28, 1983 , the a1AT produced in E. coli is slightly higher in molecular weight approximately 43,886 vs 42,000 reflecting the addition of 11 amino acid residues to the amino terminus of the fusion protein made in E. coli. Apparently, these additional amino acid residues do not inactivate the inhibitor. In addition, all of the material in the homogenates giving a positive result by the ELISA and elastase tests may be removed by the immunoadsorption procedure.The above described method for producing AT in bacteria and vectors useful therein, has been described in connection with specific embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that it is capable of further modification and this application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention following in general the principles of the invention and including such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice within the art to which the invention pertains.
