# Automatic photoflash device.

## Abstract
With an automatic photoflash device embodying this invention, detection is made of a level of voltage charged in a main capacitor 12 for supplying discharged energy to an electronic flash tube 15 and also of a level of voltage charged in a quenching capacitor 18 of a quenching cir cuit to interrupt the flash irradiation of the electronic flash tube 15 . The subject automatic photoflash device com prises an alarm unit 33, 34 , which, when a voltage charged in the main capacitor 12 has a lower level than required to allow for the light emission of the flash device, gives a first alarm, and, when a voltage charged in the quenching capacitor 18 has too low a level to allow for the quenching of the flash tube 15 , sends forth a second alarm.
