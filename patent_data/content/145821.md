# Area filling hardware for a colour graphics frame buffer.

## Abstract
A graphics display apparatus includes a raster scan ned CRT refreshed from a bit for pel refresh buffer 1 loaded with bit patterns by a microprocessor corresponding to a desired image. To display shaded areas, additional control logic 7 draws an outline of the area in an auxiliary memory 10 , preferably using Bresenham s Algorithm, according to specified rules. Edge filling logic 2 consisting of EX CLUSIVER OR gates is used to fill draw the filled area in the refresh buffer 1 as the outline is read from the auxiliary memory 10 into the refresh buffer. This hardware assis tance by the control logic and edge fill logic to the micro processor enables complex areas to be drawn and filled without unduly degrading the performance of the micro processor.
