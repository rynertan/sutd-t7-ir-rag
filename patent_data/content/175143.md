# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DISPENSING A CARBONATED BEVERAGE

## Abstract
An air pressure system for dispensing carbonated be verages that includes a power driven air compressor 31 providing a supply of air at pressure of about 140 PSIG. The compressed air passes through at least one condenser unit 32, 34 consisting of a conduit 35, 34A of selected length. The compressed air is reduced to a selected temperature as it flows under pressure to a pressure tank. The com pressed air discharges into a pressure tank in the bottom of which remains water removed from the compressed air and other impurities such as oil or the like from the com pressor. The temperature controlled, substantially clean compressed air free of oil etc. is reduced in pressure to about 20 PSIG by a pressure reducing valve 45A . Such air pressure is used to propel liquid beverages from a con tainer 21 or containers to a beverage dispensing valve 10 or valves. Preferably there are two condenser units 32, 34 , one 34 being located internally of the pressure tank and the other 32 external thereto.
