# Rotary annular signal data coupler.

## Abstract
An electro optical arrangement for transmitting sig nal data as modulated light energy across a rotating annular interface. The modulated light beams according to the system are projected axially within an annular cavity 17 and thence outward through a redundant window arrangement 15, 16 . Another annular member 10 rotatable with respect to the first one 17 includes a plurality of closer spaced but narrower second win dows 12, 13 and a light to electric transducer 25 associated with each second window. The spacing S2 the second windows is such that there is always light communication between the first and second win dow groups. The system is particularly adapted to digital modulation of the light energy.

## Description
Rotary Annular Signal Data CouplerThe invention relates to a rotary annular signal coupler as set forth in the preamble of claim 1. A rotary annular signal coupler of this kind is disclosed in DeutscheOffenlegungsschrift No. 2 716 789.The coupler described there permits information to be transferred between a fixed apparatus and an apparatus rotating concentrically therewith by means of light beams.However, information transfer is possible only if a light source and a light detector are located opposite each other. Between these positions , no information transfer is possible.The object of the invention is to provide a rotary annular signal coupler which permits continuous transfer of information.This object is attained by the means set forth in claim 1.Developments of the invention are given in the subclaims.With the novel coupler, continuous information transfer is possible. In a development, the coupler provides redundancy and is tolerant of partial failure of components. It is also possible to provide for multiplex operation. The coupler is particularly adapted for the transmission of digital signals. B.E. Kruger 4The invention will now be explained, by way of example, with reference to Figs. 1 to 5 of the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is an exploded view of a stator and rotor assembly according to the invention.Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken through any of the stator transmission windows according to Fig. 1 but with the rotor ring properly interfaced with the stator.Fig. 3 is a detail of typical stator illumination with a signal modulated light beam.Fig. 4 is a schematic block diagram of a system and electronic components therefor, according to the invent ion.Fig. 5 depicts relative rotor and stator transmission window geometry.Referring now to Fig. 1 a stator assembly generally at 17 and a rotory assembly generally at 10 are shown in exploded relationship for clarity. Actually, it will be realized that, in operation, the rotor assembly 10 fits rotatably around the periphery of 17, with its h dimension matching that of the h dimension of the light transmission windows, typically 15 and 16 of the stator 17.The inside surface of the rotor assembly 10 is identified as 11 on Fig. 1 and is divided by a succession of light transmission windows typically 12 and 13. These light transmission windows appear only at the outside B.E. Kruger 4 surface of stator housing 17 and not on the inside surface 14. However, the converse is true of the rotor assembly 10, namely that the windows appear on the inside surface 11 but not the outside surface of rotor 10.The stator assembly 17 is actually a hollow annular housing, enclosing an annular shaped interior space.Substantially the same is true of the rotor assembly 10.Referring now to Fig. 2, its sectional view taken transversely radially through one of the aforementioned light transmission windows and the stator assembly 17 is shown. A laser transmitter 19 with lens system 20 directs a modulated light beam axially onto a mirrored surface 18 and thence, radially by reflection to pass through the associated stator light transmission window 15 or 16, for example . This light signal engages and enters any of the rotor windows such as 12 or 13, etc., thereby illuminating each corresponding light to electric signal transducer 25.It will be noted that each of the stator light transmission windows 15, 16 etc. has a circumferential dimension w and axial height dimension h. Fig. 3 indicates the nature of the lens system 20 is such as to illuminate each corresponding stator light transmission window at least roughly uniformly in a pattern shown on the mirror 18 which, when reflected to the corresponding stator window approximately illuminates the entire window. A generator such as a laser diode at 19 inherently transmits a fan beam of light which is further spread by divergent optics lens system at 20.Referring now to Fig. 5, the relative geometry of rotor B.E. Kruger 4 and stator slots window is depicted. It will be noted that rotor windows have width r and are spaced by a circumferential amount S2, whereas the stator slots are spaced S1 360 in degrees. The spacing of the ro N tor slots S2 is made equal to W2rso that a stator 2 window always overlaps at least two rotor windows. If there are M rotor windows slots , then M is obviously from these relationships, and the number of rotor 2 windows, each of circumferential width r can be determined. The annular enclosure curved inner and outer perimeter surfaces are referred to hereinafter as axially extending surfaces.Each rotor window, of course, has an associated light to electric transducer 25 as depicted in Fig. 2, and each stator window has an associated illuminating source 19 and mirror surface 18. According to the arrangement suggested by Fig. 1, N such stator 3600 windows spaced circumferentially by N are contem plated. Quite abviously a single stator window with associated means for illuminating it with modulated light energy would provide the function desired, except that no redundancy would exist in the event of failure of the illuminating apparatus.Referring now to Fig. 4, a typical arrangement providing the electronic apparatus needed is illustrated. An input driver 21 receives an electrical signal at input 23. This signal may be multiplexed, or may in fact be a plurality of separate signals each representing a desired function to be effected in the antenna or other apparatus rotating with rotor 10. The inherent handwidth of the optical medium is so high that color, frequency or other multi B.E. Kruger 4 plexing techniques may be employed. Thus, the input driver 21, which includes the appropriate amplification for driving the laser sources 19 may include the desired multiplexing circuits, for example, of the same character well known and well understood in the fiber optic communication art.Each of the N transmitting light sources 19 is identified as Tx and each of the M rotor light to electric transducers Rx would operate at all times as the rotor assembly 10 turns about the common central axis it shares with the stator assembly. That is, the foregoing assumes N stator windows such as 15 and 16 each with associated source and the relative rotor window geometry depited in Fig. 5. Finally, the combiner 22 which is receptive to the outputs of all transducers Rx may provide a simple multiple input OR circuit having common output 24, or alternatively, a complexed voting scheme might be incorporated in combiner 22 and could be based on some criterion pertinenç to a particular electronic radar system with which the combination of the invention is included. The vertical orientation of the rotor and stator windows minimizes the collection of foreign matter thereon, and obviously the structure could be modified to place the rotor annulus within the stator, in which case stator windows would be on the internal surface and rotor windows would be on the outside surface of the rotor annulus. Still further, the illuminated windows could be in the rotor assembly and the larger number of signal receiving windows could be placed in B.E. Kruger 4 the stator if this variation were consistent with signal flow considerations.Suitable materials and components are readily selected by those of skill in the electrical and mechanical arts, there being no requirements not evident herein and no considerations or tolerances. Both the rotor and stator interior annular spaces may be sealed, if operation in a particular hostile environment is contemplated. If such sealing is to be employed, both the rotor and stator windows may be fabricated from a suitable glass or transparent material, adhesively or hermetically bonded to the shell of the enclosure. From the foregoing description, it will be realized that the present invention provides a highly failureresistent signal data transmission medium for applications such as an around the mast radar antenna arrangement.It will be noted that digital signals transferred redundantly from more than one stator window through more than one rotor window arrive at the light to elcectric transducers 25 time synchronously. The result of this synchronism at the output of combiner 22 is that the original transfer is uninterrupted and unaffected by rotor stator relative angular velocities from zero up to a mechanically achievable maximum. Moreover, the sense of rotor stator relative rotation has no effect on the operation of the device.
