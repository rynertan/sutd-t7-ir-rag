## Description
IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT FACTOR The present invention is concerned with immunomodulatory substances. It is more particularly concerned with an immunosuppressant factor capable of inhibiting T cell mechanisms particularly those which areInterleukin 2 IL 2 dependent. The role of T cells in cell mediated immunity e.g. by cooperation with ss lymphocytes is well established and substances which are capable of inhibiting T cell mechanisms involved in the generation of antibodies would be used to suppress or reduce the body s immune response. Such substances could thus be employed e.g. in connection with transplants to prevent rejection and also in connection with the treatment of diseases characterised by an auto immune response in the body. We have now found that cultured human glioblastoma cells secrete a factor that inhibits interleukin 2 IL 2 dependent T cell mechanisms.This factor has an inhibitory effect on IL 2 induced proliferation ofT cell clones and on the induction of alloreactive cytotoxic T cells in mixed lymphocyte cultures. It further inhibits the growth of neuroblasts but not of fibroblasts. This factor can be obtained form the cystic fluid or SN of cultured human glioblastoma cell lines and has an approximate molecular weight of 97,000. Cultured human glioblastoma cells are characterized by ultrastructural features, especially the presence of microfibrils, and by biochemical markers, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein GFA andS 100 protein 7, 4, 15 . In addition human glioma cells express neurooctodermal antigens shared with melanomas and neuroblastomas 8 , as well as la like antigens and the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen CALLA , an antigen expressed on lymphoid cells from patients with the common form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia 16, 17 . Two inmunoregulatory mediators, a suppressor factor and a helper factor, were detected in the supernatant of glioblastoma cells. The helper factor shares the characteristics of macrophage derived IL 1. The characterization of the factor as an IL l like mediator is based on the finding that the factor a enhances the PHA induced thymocyte proliferation, bj exhibits no IL 2 activity, but c augments the IL 2 production by nitrogen stimulated spleen cells, and d has a m.w. of 22,000. In this context it is of interest that mouse astrocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and rat C6 glioma cells secrete analogous IL l like factors in vitro 9, 18, 19 . Furthermore, rat astrocytes have been shown to present antigen to T lymphocytes, e.g. to activate myelin basic proteinspecific T lymphocyte lines 20 .In addition, cultured rat astrocytes express la antigens upon interaction with T cells 20 . The production of IL l lie factors and the presentation of antigen by astrocytes may have a central role in the generation of immune responses in the brain. There is also recent evidence that the central nervous system is capable of mounting specific immune responses to antigens and tumor cells when introduced to the brain 21 . Analogous to astrocytes, glioblastoma cells, which may represent transformec astrocyte precursor cells, do produce IL l like factors in vitro. The effect of the IL 1 like helper factor, however, is overriden by the presently described inhibitory factor also elaborated by the tumor cells.This factor inhibits the proliferative response of T cells to Con A or to both PHA and IL 1 IL 2 standards. The factor also blocks the proliferation of an H 2 restricted, hapten specific T cell line that normally grows in tne presence of IL 2 and haptenated irradiated spleen cells. The glioblast a derived suppressor factor has no effect on IL 2 production by Con imWlated spleen cells and does not influence the growth of a thymoma cel line EL 4 cells , which proliferate independently of IL 2.However, tse factor abrogates the IL 2 induced proliferation of a clonedT cell line. IL 2 does not substitute for the inhibitor effect of the supernatant containing the factor on the deveopment of CTL. Taken together, these results indicate that the factor interferes with terminal events in the T cell activation cascade. The hypothesis that this glioblastoma derived suppressor factor influences proliferative steps not necessarily involving direct IL 2 effects on T cells is based on the finding that the 97,000 m.w. factor does also inhibit the growth of neuroblasts, which grow independently of IL 2. Recently, the presence of immunosuppressive factors in the conditioned medium of various human tumor cells was investigated 22 . Out of 12 different tumors three melanoma, two sarcoma, and seven carcinoma the SN of only three tumors produced greater than 30 inhibition of PHA induced blastogenesis. However, as shown by dilution experiments the inhibitory effect was only visible up to a 1 4 dilution of the SN higher dilutions had no effect 22 . When using the conditions to produce and to test the gliobalstoma SN, the SN of two neuroblastoma, a melanoma, and a rhabdomyosarcoma had no effect on responsiveness of thymocytes to Con A. This supports the assumption that among nonlymphoid tumors glioblastoma cells are at the present time unique for their capacity to release immunosuppressive factors in vivo and in vitro. Depression of immune responsiveness has been documented in patients with glioblastoma 1 6 . Impared cell mediated immunity in glioblastoma patients is indicated by depressed skin reactivity to common antigens, decreased ability to become sensitized to dinitrochlorobenzene, and decreased in vitro lymphocyte responsiveness to PHA or antigens. Factors released by the tumor cells may well account for the described T cell immune deficiency state. This idea is supported by the detection of imhibitory factors on T cell activation present in glioblastoma cultureSN in vitro and the cyst fluid of glioblastoma tumors in vivo. In addition the sera of gliobalstoma patients contain a factor that inhibits the mixed lymphocyte reaction and the PHA and Con A induced lymphocyte proliferation in vitro.After removal of the glioblastoma by neurosurgery, suppressor activity in the scra disappeared 1, 4 . Although it is well documented that in most glioblastoma patients, humoral immune responses to their tumors develop 23, 24 , there is little evidence of significant cellular anti tumor immune responses 25, 27 . In general, cytotoxic T cells have been implicated to contribute to the development of the cellular anti tumor immune reactions 28, 29 . TheIL 2 dependency of the generation of CTL has been demonstrated by in vivo adinistration of highly purified IL 2 in concert with injections of tumor cells, which resulted in an augmented CTL and natural killer cell response in mice 30 . The observed blocking of the generation of CTL by the glioblastoma cell derived 97.000 m.w. factor according to the invention may account at least in part for inefficient immunosurvelliance against glioblastomas. Impaired host immunocompetence may also emanate from lymphokineinduced production of mucopolysaccharide coats by glioblastoma cells that nonspecifically suppress the cellular immune response 31 . In addition to its relevance for modulation of T cell activation the supernatant containing the factor is of interest for its neuroblast growth inhibitory factor NGIF like activity. NGIF is released by fetal rat glioblasts and exerts suppressor activities on neuroblasts but not on fibroblasts 31, 32 . In addition, this 75.000 m.w. factor possessed the activity to promote morphological differentiation of Neuro 2A cells as evidenced by the formation of neural processes 32, 33 . In an analogous assay we also observed that the Sephacryl S 200 glioblastoma fractions, which inhibited T cell responsiveness to IL 2 and the growth of neuroblasts, did induce neurile outgrowth.

The following abbreviations are employed IL 1, Interleukin 1 IL 2, Interleukin 2 NGIF, neuroblast growth inhibition factor SN, supernatant GFA, glial fibrillary acidic protein DMEM, Dulbeccots modified Eagle s medium ConA, concanvalin A 2 ME, 2 mercaptoethanol 3H Tdr.E3H thymidine PHA, phytohemaglutinin OVA cells, ovalbminspecific T cell line CTL, cytotoxic T lymphoctes MLC mixed lymphocyte culture LPS, Lipopolysaccharide AED, N idodoacetyl N 5 sulfonic 1 naphthyl ethylene diamine CH, cycloheximide.Example 1 Four human glioblastoma cell lines are established and maintained in mono layer cultures by the method described in Diserens et.al., ActaNeurophthol. 53 21. Four cells lines used in the examples are designatedC1 18 1 229 992 and 308 and were maintained for 72, 28, 8 and 4 months respectively. Characterization of the glioblastoma cell lines revealed that cells from C1 22, 308 and 992 expressed la like antigens on their surface, cells from 308 and 992 were positive for glial fibrilliary acidic protein GFA , and cells from C1 18, 308 and 992 expressed a neuroectodermal antigen identified by recently described monoclonal antibodies Acta Neuropathol. 57 158 Carrell S., et.al. For production of SN the glioblastoma cells were plated at 1 x 104 to 1 x 106 cells well 2.4 x 1.7 cm Linbro Scientific in culture medium consisting of DulSecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM , 10 fetal calf serum FOS , and 300 ug ml L glutamine. Twenty four hours after plating the glioblastoma cells, the medium was replaced with 0.5 ml culture medium. The SN were collected 1 to 5 days later, centrifuged 2000 x G. 10 min and ultrafiltrated by using a micropartition system with Y3 membrane MPS.1, Amicon . The material deposited after centrifugation 1500 x G. 15 min on the membrane m.w. 10.000 , was resuspended in RPMI 1640 to give the original volume and passed through 0.45 um filters. Example 2 ThXmocXte Eroliferation assay The effect of glioblastoma SN on the thymocyte proliferative response to concanavalin A Con A was tested in the following way. Samples of 50 ,ul of SN at various dilutions were added to 6 x 105 thymocytes from C3H HeJ mice thymocytes were suspended in 150 ul of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 300 ug ml L glutamine. 1 x 10 5 M 2 mercaptoethanol 2 ME . and 5 FCS in flat bottomed microtiter plates and incubated for 72 hours in the presence of Con A 1 jug well . Sixteen hours before harvest 0.5 rCi of H Tdr. 5.0 Ci mmol was added per well. The results are shown in Figures 1A and B as percent suppression compared with the Con A response of thymocytes treated with a medium control. In Figure 1A the SN of the four glioblastoma cell lines used were harvested after 1, 3 and 5 days and tested at a final dilution of 1 10 on the thymocytes. In Figure 1B the testing took place on SN of 308 cells harvested after culture for 5 days at different seeding densities and final dilutions. In the absence of glioblastoma SN or medium control the background count was 4 229 and the Con A response 76.797 6.631 cpm. The magnitude of inhibitory potency of the SN can be seen to be dependent on time of culture and cell density. In selected experiments on metabolic inhibition using 308 cells the production of SN was performed with irradiated 2000 R or mitomycinC treated 50 pg ml, 30 min. 370C glioblastoma cells. Alternatively cycloheximide 10 5M was added to glioblastoma cells at the beginning of the 72 hour culture cycloheximide was also added to control SN collected after 72 hours. These SN were ultrafiltrated three times before testing to remove CH. The results of these experiments are summarised in Figure 2, where the S, of 106 cells cultured over 5 days were employed. As a CH control theSh of CH treated 308 cells and of 308 SN supplemented with CH after ccllection were untrafiltrated. In a further control, experiments were carried out on four established human tumor cell lines unrelated to glioblastoma cells. These results are sumnarised in Table 1.

In the presence of Con A, thymocytes were incubated with 1 10 dilution of tumor cell SN or a control culture medium for the tumor cell SN. In the presence of medium control the background count of thymocytes was 432 112 and the Con A response was 45G41 4817. It will be noted that the release of immunosuppressive factors does not appear to be a general property of cultured tumor cells. Analysis of the L arginine content in 308 SN revealed that inhibition is not due to arginine degradation in the medium by an arginase release by 308 cells. Furthermore, the 308 mediated inhibition could not be explained by the production of interferon as no antiviral activity was detected in 308 SN.Example 3 Effect of glisblastoma SN on B lymphocytes and non lympholdcells Mouse fibroblasts A9, 3T3, LS cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with L glutamine 300 ug ml and 10 FCS mouse neuroblasts Neuro 2A, NB4, 1A3 cell lines were plated in Earle s minimum essential medium with 10 FCS. L glutamine 300 ug ml , and 1 nonessential amino acids 100x . Fibroblasts and neuroblasts 104 cells well were incubated in 0.2 ml of medium for 72 hours. For the final 6 hours, the cells were pulsed with 1.2 uCl of 3H Tdr. Thereafter, the medium was aspirated from each well, replaced with trypsin EDTA. and incubated 370C, 10 min .Finally, the cells were harvested with the use of an automated harvester. The data in Table II indicate that when compared with its effect on thymocytes, the 308 SN was less inhibitory on B cell proliferation the percentage of inhibition of the LPS induced stimulation of spleen cells was 29 , whereas the corresponding value for the mycloma cell lineX63 Ag8 was 21 . There was no difference in thymidine uptake between fibroblast cultures containing 308 SN and those being supplemented with a medium control. This was true for all three fibroblast cell lines tested. In contrast, the gliobalstoma SN singificantly suppressed the growth of the two neuroblast cell lines as measured by the uptake of 3H Tdr Fig.3,Table II and by counting the number of cells at termination of the 72 hr cultures.Twenty four, 48 and 72 hr after culturing 1 x 104 Neuro 2A cells well, the cell numbers x 104 well of quadruplicate cultures were in the presence of the 308 SN 98 0.17 24 hr ,l.80 0.36 48 hr , and 4.3 0.44 72 hr , whereas the corresponding values for the medium controls were 0.88 0.05, 2.55 0. 06, and 6.08 0.40, respectively.

Example 4 Mechanisms of glioblastoma SN induced inhibition of T cell activation activation Thymocytes were treated with 308 SN final dilution of 1 10 in the presence of PHA 0.5 ug well and various dilutions 1 10 in 1 160 of IL 1 or IL 2. In the absence of interleukins the background count was 209 84 and the PHA response was 3074 425. The IL 1 preparation used was prepared from LPS stimulated peritoneal cells with ConA Sepharose as described in reference 7. The results are summarised in Table III.

The IL 1 preparation used was prepared from LPS stimulated peritoneal cells of BALB c mice the IL 2 was prepared by stimulation of BALB c spleen cells with Con A Sepharose as described previously 17 . These results show that inhibition of the Con A response of thymocytes apparently results from influences on late events of the T cell activation cascade, because the 308 SN inhibited the proliferative response of thymocytes stimulated with PHA in the presence of IL 1 or IL 2. The degree of 308 SN induced suppression of proliferation was similar at various concentrations of IL 1 or IL 2 employed. EXAMPLE 5 Effect of SS 308 on cloned T cell linesProliferation of H 2b restricted hapten N iodoacetyl N 5 sulfonicl naphthyl ethylene diamine EAED specific cloned cytotoxic T cells CTL 10 was assessed in culture medium consisting of Iscove s modified DM M supplemented with 10 FCS, 1 x 10 5 M 2 ME, antibodies, anc 10 v v of a 24 hr spleen cell Con A SN IL 2 SN .The CTL well were cultured alone or together with 106 irradiated 2000 rad haptenated spleen cells H 2b as stimulators.Various dilations of SN of 308 glioblastoma cells or of a control medium were added to the mixture of the CTL and stimulators cultured in culture medium for 72 hr. Sixteen hours before harvest, each well was pulsed with 1.2 pCi of 3H Tdr.308 glioblastoma SN was also tested on cloned ovalbumin specificT cells 0Vm cells . The OVA cells were cultured for 48 hr in 0.2 ml culture medium see above with IL 2 SN. The IL 2 dependent proliferation was tested in the presence of various dilutions of 308 SN or indium control. The incorporation of 3H Tdr 1.2 pl well was measure over a 12 hr period.The results are shown in figures 4A and 4B. In A. hapten specific cloned CTL were cultured at 10 cells alone R or together with 106 irradiated 2000 rad AED haptenated spleen cells as stimulators S black bar . Various dilutions 1 8 to 1 128 of 308 glioblastoma SN or a 1 8 dilution of control mediumEMI14.1 were added to the mixture of CTL and cultured for 72 hr. In B 104OVA cells were cultured for 48 hr with IL 2 SN black bar or without IL 2 SN . The 308 glioblastoma SN 1 8 to 1 128 diluted or a 1 8 dilution of control mediumEMI14.2 was added to OVA cells in the presence of IL 2 final dilution 1 20 . Data are given as counts per minute of 3H Tdr incorporation. Figure 4A shows that cells of an H 2 restricted, hapten specificT cell line proliferated in the presence of IL 2 and haptenated, irradiated spleen cells as stimulator cells. This prolifersstion was completely blocked by adding the glioblastoma produced factor.Maximal inhibition was noted when the factor was added in OVA T cells growing in the presence of IL 2 only Fig. 4B .From the experiments outlined above, the inhibition of T cell growth by glioblastoma cell derived factors could be due to their direct interference with IL 2 triggered events leading to T cell proliferation. This possibility is supported further by the finding that the 308 SN had no effect on the growth of a thymoma cell line that grows of a thymoma cell line that grows independently of IL 2 Table II .EXAMPLE 6 The release of analogous inhibitory factors by the glioblastoma cells in vivo was demonstrated by testing the ultrafiltrated cyst fluid of the patient from whom the 308 cells originated. The cyst fluid final dilution 1 20 , ultrafiltrated on YMB membranes, induced a 28 inhibition of the IL 2 induced proliferation of OVAT cells, whereas 12 control sera had no effect. EXAMPLE 7 Effect of glioblastoma SN on the induction of cytotoxic T cells Anti H 2b specific CTL were induced by stimulation of 12 x 106BlO.D2 H 2d spleen cells with 30 x 106 irradiated 2000 R C57B1 6 H 2b stimulator spleen cells in 6 ml Iscove s modifiedDMEM containing 10 FCS. 1 x 10 5 M 2 ME, and antibiotics mixed lymphocyte culture MLC medium .

Results are given as percent specific 51 Cr release see Reference 11 . Test duration 3 hr. Mean values of three samples. The preparation and testing of Sephacryl 5 200 column fractions is described below . A.s shown in figure 6 the addition of IL 2 together with the 308 SN .actor did not restore the generation of CTL. A 2 hr preincubation of mature CTL with 308 SN had no influence on the function of CTL on their targets.In Fig. 6 A during the entire culture period of 6 days, IL 2 final concentration of 10 Con A SN was present in MLC treated with 308 SN 1 1. diluted EMI16.5 or medium controlEMI16.6 After 6 days the CTL activity was tested qn EL 4 cells. In B. before testing on EL 4 cells, CTL generated over 6 days in culture medium were preincubated for 2 hr in medium control or 308 SN 1 4 diluted .EXAMPLE 8 Biochemical characterisation of the glioblastoma SNThe 308 glioblastoma SN obtained from 08 cells cultured in serum free conditions over 96hr was concentrated 30 fold by ultrafiltration on YM lO Amteon membrane, and 1.5 ml ef concentrated Sh was applied on a Sephacryl 5 200 column size 2.5 x 85 cm at 4 C as described 9 . The elate collected in 2.5 rnl fractions was monitored for adsorbance at 280 nm and was tested on fibroblasts L 929 and neuroblasts Neuro 2 A as described above. In addition the fractions were tested on OVA cells in the presence ofIL2 and on thymocytes stimulated with PHA.The column, in a parallel run, was calibrated wit h y globulin y Glob. m.w. 150.000 . bovine serum albumin BSA. m.w. 67.000 , ovalbumin OVA, mw. 45.000 , a chymotrypsinogen CHY. m.w, 25.000 , and cytochrome c CYT f. m.w. 12.400 .These results are summarized in Figure 7 whereby the upper table shows the calibration run. Results are given as stimulation index SI comparing proliferation of cells treated with column fractions to cells treated with medium control. Results of serum free control medium fractionated on a Sephacryl S 20Q column are shown on OVA cells treated with II. 2EMI17.1 The peak of the inhibitory activity on neuroblasts and OVA cells was elú.ted from the column, at the identical position, with an apparent m.w. of 97.000 Fig. 7 .Sephacryl S 200 fractions of a medium control consisting of DMEM Fig. 7 and a medium control supplemented with 10 FCS data not shown had no inhibitory effects en the growth of OVA cells stimulated with IL 2. Further more, no inhibitory effect was observed when testing 308 SN fractions on fibroblasts. In fact, the growth of fibroblasts but not of neuroblasts or of IL 2 treated OVA cells was augmented by fractions that exhibit an apparent m.w. of around 22.000. These fractions were identified to additionally stimulate the PHA response of mouse thymocytes Fig. 7 but to have no effect on the growth of OVA cells cultured in the absence of IL 2 the incorporation of 3H Tdr by OVA cells was 284 72 and in the presence of IL 2 final dilution 1 10 was 62038 2931.When OVA cells were treatea with 308 fractions eluting from the column between m.w.150.000 and 10.000, no proliferation of the OVA cells was observed, with cpm values never exceeding 500. This indicates the absence of IL 2 in 308 fractions including those that were found to augment the PHA response of thymocytes.EXAMPLE 9 Pools cf chromatographed fractions of the 308 SN were assayed for their ability to enhance the release of IL 2 by spleen cells treated with suboptial doses of Con A. and the results summarized in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8 A fractions were assayed for their capacity to augment the PHA response of thymocytes data are given as stimulation index S1 comparing the PHA response of thymocytes treated with column fractions to untreated thymocytes. EF, effluent volume ml . InB,pooled fractions pool I to V were concentrated 10 x on YMB membranes and were tested for their ability to enhance the release of IL 2 by spleen cells 5 x 106 ml . After 44 hr the spleen cell SN were harveated, and the IL 2 activity was assayed on OVA cells.The activity in test samples was transformed into units as described in reference 13.Activity Reciprocal titer of test sample at 30 of maximal standard cpm Reciprocal titer at 30 of maximal standard cpm In the absence of pooled fractions of 308 SN the amount of IL 2 released by spleen cells treated with Con A 0.5 pg ml was 21U ml upon treatment with optimal doses of Con A 5,ug ml the IL 2 content measured was 97 U ml.Compared with Con A alone, pool I to III neither stimulates nor inhibited the release of IL 2 Fig. 8 . However, with fraction pool IV and V the increase of the amount of IL 2 released was 3.5 and 1.6 fold, respectively Fig. 8 . Thus the capacity to enhance the release of IL 2 by spleen cells appears to be associated with fractions augmenting the PHA response of thymocytes.In addition to inhibiting neuroblast growth, the 308 fractions were found to induce the outgrowth of neurites of Neuro 2A cells 66 of Neuro 2A cells treated with fraction 93 peak inhibitory fraction on neuroblast growth showed cell processes3 whereas the corresponding values in cultures treated with control fractions fraction 112 or control medium were 21 and 22 , respectively.
