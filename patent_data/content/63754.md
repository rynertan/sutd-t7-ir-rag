# Pyrazolopyridine derivatives, and preparation, useful as cardiotonics.

## Abstract
1 R 3 NB 5 PY 6 Q 1H pyrazolo 3,4 b pyridines or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof, which are useful as cardiotonics, are prepared by reacting a 1 R 5 PY 6 Q 1H pyrazolo 3,4 b pyridin 3 amine with a lower alkanoic acid and reducing agent to produce 1 R 3 NB 5 PY 6 Q 1H pyrazolo 3,4 b pyridine I where NB is NHR₁ or NR₁R₂, with a mixture of formic acid and formal dehyde to produce I where NB is N CH₃ ₂ or with a lower acylating agent to produce I where NB is NHAc and, if desired, reacting the 3 NHAc compound with a reducing agent to prepare the corresponding 3 NHR₁ compound, where R is lower alkyl, lower hydroxyalkyl, lower acyloxy lower alkyl or lower alkoxy alkyl, Q is hydrogen or lower alkyl, PY is 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two lower alkyl substituents, and NB is selected from NHR₁, NR₁R₂ or NHAc where R₁ and R₂ are each lower alkyl and Ac is lower acyl. Also shown are cardiotonic compositions and method for increasing cardiac contractil ity using said compounds or salts.
