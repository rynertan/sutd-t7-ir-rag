# Soil surface cultivating machine.

## Abstract
A soil cultivating implement has a tined rotor 14 mounted on a frame 10 for rotation about an axis transverse to the intended direction of movement of the implement, and with the tines 15 penetrating the ground in use. The tines 15 are arranged in a sense to enter the ground when the rotor 14 rotates in a direction contrary to that of the driving wheels of a vehicle driving the implement. The rotor 14 rotates in the same direction as the wheels of the vehicle but at a lower peripheral speed than the speed of movement of the imple ment over the ground this being effected by a connection 16,17,18 to the power take off from the vehicle, or other means power produced at the rotor 14 by the difference in forward speed of the tines 15 in the ground being cultivated and the forward speed of the implement and the power may be used to assist the forward movement of the implement.
