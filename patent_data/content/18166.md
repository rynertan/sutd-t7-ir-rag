# Apparatus for use in stereotactic surgery.

## Abstract
A stereotactic surgery frame with x ray detectable fiducial markers 100, 102, 104 is presented. The frame is fixed with respect to a patient s anatomy and defines a predetermined three dimensional coordinate system X, Y, Z in which surgical devices may be precisely positioned. A desired target area 170 of the anatomy is detected in a cross sectional CT scanner depiction of the combined ste reotactic frame and patient anatomy. The target s X, Y, Z coordinates with respect to the frame are calculated based on three non collinear fiduciai points F₁, F₂, F₃ locaded within the cros section and having known coordinates both with respect to the frame and with respect to the tar get. Thus, the surgical device can be precisely applied in the target area.
