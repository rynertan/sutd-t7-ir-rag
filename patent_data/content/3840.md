# Method of converting an input analog signal to an output digital signal and analog to digital converter.

## Abstract
Comparators 14 46 at the output of an integrator 12 30 cause a counter 18 68 to count up or down in accordance with the relative amplitudes of the input analog and a feedback reference signal to bring the stored charge in the integrator 12 30 back to the low nominal value. The output of this counter 18 68 is applied to a range decoder 20 70, 72 which applied selected geometricaly varying ranges of digital signals to a digital to analog converter 16 42 . The output of the digital to analog converter 16 42 is applied both to the subtracting or negative input of the integrator 12 30 , and also provides a reference signal for the comparator 14 46 . By controlling the time period of each integration and counting the amount of stored energy removed from the integrator 12 30 , the counter output which is related to the such removed stored energy, is the digital equivalent of the analog signal.
