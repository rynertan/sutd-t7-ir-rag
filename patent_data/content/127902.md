Compounds of Formula II may be converted to sulfonate esters III by reaction with the appropriate sulfonyl halide or sulfonic anhydride in a solvent plus a base or in a basic organic solvent such as pyridine. It is desirable when the A group has a sulfonamide hydrogen to use pyridine or other mildly basic solvents such as the picolines or collidines. As solvents, 1,2 dimethoxyethane, dioxane, Compounds III may be reacted with sodium, potassium, lithium, cesium or rubidium azides in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as DMF, N methylpyrrolidone, DMAc, sulfolane, dimethylsulfoxide, tetramethylurea, hexamethylphosphoramide HMPA , etc. along with the appropriate catalyst such as 18 crown 6 for sodium and potassium azide and 12 crown 4 for lithium azide.

The azides IV may be reduced by any of several methods, including hydrogenation over palladium on charcoal. It is also possible to reduce the azides by treating with 1,3 propanedithiol and a base such as triethylamine. Azides may also be reduced to amines by hydrogen sulfide and by trivalent phosphorous compounds such as trimethylphosphine and trimethylphosphite, and by mercaptans such as mercaptoacetic acid. Reduction with hydrogen can best be used where A is hydrogen, but it will work where A is a hexavalent sulfur containing group.

The antibacterial agents of this invention can be administered by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agent s site of action in the body of a mammal. They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents. They can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The dosage administered will, of course, vary depending upon known factors such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent, and its mode and route of administration age, health, and weight of the recipient nature and extent of symptoms, kind of concurrent treatment, frequency of treatment, and the effect desired. Usually a daily dosage of active ingredient can be about 5 to 20 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Ordinarily, when the more potent compounds of this invention are used, 5 to 15, and preferably 5 to 7.5 milligrams per kilogram per day, given in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day or in sustained release form, is effective to obtain desired results. These drugs may also be administered parenterally. Dosage forms compositions suitable for internal administration contain from about 1.0 milligram to about 500 milligrams of active ingredient per unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.5 95 by weight based on the total weight of the composition. The active ingredient can be administered orally in solid dosage forms, such as capsules, tablets, and powders, or in liquid dosage forms, such as elixirs, syrups, and suspensions, it can also be administered parenterally, in sterile liquid dosage forms. Gelatin capsules contain the active ingredient and powdered carriers, such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose glucose , and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration contain preferably a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidants such as sodium bisulfate, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid either alone or combined are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl or propyl paraben, and chlorobutanol. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Useful pharmaceutical dosage forms for administration of the compounds of this invention can be illustrated as follows A large number of unit capsules are prepared by filling standard two piece hard gelatin capsules each with 75 milligrams of powdered active ingredient, 150 milligrams of lactose, 24 milligrams of talc and 6 milligrams of magnesium stearate. A mixture of active ingredient in soybean oil is prepared and injectd by means of a positive displacement pump into gelatin to form soft gelatin capsules containing 75 milligrams of the active ingredient. The capsules are washed and dried. A large number of tablets are prepared by conventional procedures so that the dosage unit is 75 milligrams of active ingredient, 0.2 milligrams of colloidal silicon dioxide, 5 milligrams of magnesium stearate, 250 milligrams of microcrystalline cellulose, 11 milligrams of cornstarch and 98.8 milligrams of lactose. Appropriate coatings may be applied to increase palatability or delay absorption. A parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5 by weight of active ingredient in 10 by volume propylene glycol and water. The solution is made isotonic with sodium chloride and sterilized. An aqueous suspension is prepared for oral administration so that each 5 milliliters contain 75 milligrams of finely divided active ingredient, 200 milligrams of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, 5 milligrams of sodium benzoate, 1.0 grams of sorbitol solution, U.S.P., and 0.025 milliliters of vanillin. Test results indicate that the novel compounds of this invention are biologically active against gram negative and gram positive bacteria including betalactamase producing As shown in Table 7, compounds of formula I exert an The Projected therapeutic levels in humans should be attained from the oral administration of 5 20 mg kg of body weight given in divided doses two to four times daily. The dosages may be increased in severe or life threatening infections.
