# Fluid pressure operable tractor and trailer vehicle braking systems.

## Abstract
A tractor trailer vehicle fluid pressure braking control system enabling two line control of trailer service and secondary braking includes for tractor braking a service brake control valve 5 for controlling the fluid pressure applied both to service brake actuators and to a trailer service brake control line 13 , a secondary control valve 45 which controls the magnitude of a counteracting pressure applied to tractor spring brakes and also to a relay valve 17 which controls a pressure in a trailer secondary spring brake control line 18 .
