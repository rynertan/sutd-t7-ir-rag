# Dispersion polymerisation process for making toner.

## Abstract
Dispersion polymerisation process for producing colored toner particles comprising admixing a colorant with a mono mer to form an oil soluble organic phase, admixing a polymeri sation initiator with the organic phase, admixing the organic phase with an aqueous phase containing a suspending agent and an inorganic salt therein under polymerisation conditions to form a suspension, polymerising the suspension under con tinuous agitation to provide polymer particles containing the colorant and having a particle size in the range of from about 1 micron to about 100 microns, and recovering the polymer par ticles. The inorganic salt inhibits polymerisation in the aqueous phase. Developer compositions and processes for developing electrostatic latent images are also disclosed.
