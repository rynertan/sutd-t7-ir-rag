# System for controlling the transmission ratio of an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
A system for an infinitely variable transmission having a primary pulley having a hydraulically shiftable disc and a hydraulic cylinder for shifting the disc, a secondary pulley having a hydraulically shiftable disc and a hydraulic cylinder for operating the disc and a belt engaged with both pulleys. A hydraulic circuit has a transmission ratio control valve com prising a spool for selectively shifting the disc of the primary pulley in the downshift direction and upshift direction. A shift cam is provided for operating the transmission ratio control valve dependent on throttle position. First means are provided for detecting a wide open throttle and producing a signal to which second means are responsive so as to shift the spool of the transmission ratio control valve in the downshift direction.
