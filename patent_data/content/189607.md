## Description
Method for the separation of hydrogen isotopes. This invention relates to a method for the separation of the hydrogen isotopes by means of gas solid chromatography on zeolite substrates. The hydrogen isotopes, including the ortho para derivatives, have been separated on a variety of chromatographic columns. Most methods are based on absorption at low temperature 77 R on solid substrates such as alumina, molecular sieves and silicagel. The separation of hydrogen, hydrogen deuteride and deuterium was reported by Smith and Hunt in J. Phys. Chem. 64, 383 1960 and in J. Phys. Chem. 65, 87 1961 . 0They used a 4 m chromia alumina column at 77 K with neon as the carrier gas. The H2 peak eluted from the column in 50 min. andD2 in 133 min., then the column was partially deactivated with water. Partial deactivation can create problems in terms of column stability and reproducibility of the system. Still retention times are quite long. Moore and Ward, J. Phys. Chem. 65 832 1960 obtained a good separation using an iron coated alumina column of 4 m with He as the carrier gas. The hydrogen peak appears in 16 min. and deuterium in 28 min. The separation was confirmed by the study of GF Shipman Anal. Chem. 34, 877 1962 and by the work of C. Genty and R.Schott, Anal. Chem. 42, 7 1970 . The article by Shipman indicates a great impact of the packing preparation procedure on the properties of the column.The packing preparation is rather complicated and time consuming.The retention times decrease with use of the column. M.Venugopalan and K.O. Kutschke Can. Chem. 41, 548 1963 used a strongly activated alumina column for the analysis of micromol quantities of the hydrogen isotopes. The packing was activated 0 for 1 week at 723 K in a flow of He. M.L. Conti and M. Lesimple J.Chromatogr. 29, 32 1967 studied the use of molecular sieve 4A for the separation of the isotopic mixture at different temperatures in the range of 1630K 113 R. A special cryostat was built in the laboratory to work in this temperature region.Separation of the isotopes was obtained depending on the activation of the column. Retention times for H2 and D2 were, on a 2.20 m column at 1220K respectively 15 min. and 25 min. In this invention we claim that zeolites and modified zeolites can be used for an efficient separation of the hydrogen isotopes. The packing preparation of the columns is easy and reproducible. The packing can easily be regenerated and the retention times are short, operating at higher temperatures, preferably 120 250 K, more in particular 197 K. Preferably a zeolite having a particle size of between 100 and 300 pm is used. The e zeolite was crushed, sieved and the fraction 80 100 mesh 150 180 pm used to fill a 2 m copper column 2,2 mm ID.Special care was taken in the filling procedure to obtain a closed, uniform packing. The e column ends were scaled with a plug of DMCS dimethylchlorosilane treated glass wool. After fitting, the column was conditioned at 4000C in the oven of the chromatograph with a moderate flow of He. The columns were connected to the instrument so that they could be inserted alternately in the oven for the thermal treatment and in an external Dewar with liquid nitrogen or dry ice aceton mixture for the analytical path, avoiding any contamination with air. The gas chromatograph was a Variannmodel 1420 with thermal conductivity detector. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 30 ml min . A synthetic mixture of 1 vol. H2 and 1 viol. D2 in He balance was injected by means of a gas injection valve with a sample loop of 1 ml. A typical 0 chromatogram column temperature 76 C is shown in fig. 1. TCD bridge current 375 m A. In Fig. 2 a typical chromatogram column temperature 120 C is shown, using the same mixture and, apart from the column temperature, the same conditions. When the column was operated at liquid nitrogen temperature both hydrogen and deuterium are adsorbed.Depending on the column temperature 760C to 1300C the resolutionEMI2.1 whereEMI3.1 retention times injection measurements , w1, w2 widths at the base of the peaks 1 and 2 varied between 1.3 and 1.67.The separation factor S.F.increased from 1.14 to 1.32EMI3.2 in this temperature range
