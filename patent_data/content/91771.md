# Muffler and method for retarding corrosion in mufflers.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a non catalytic method for extending the life of the metal parts of an automobile muffler which comprises placing an adsorbent mass, preferably of crystal line zeolitic molecular sieve, in the internal space thereof, in sufficient amount to prevent condensation of water vapour from the engine exhaust gases on the walls thereof after engine shutdown. This procedure significantly inhibits corro sion of the metal parts.
