# Apparatus for compacting scrap.

## Abstract
To compact such scrap materials as relatively com minuted chip, waste, and the like, an apparatus is provided which comprises a vertically extending briquetting machine 1 , upstream whereof there is provided at least one hor izontal pre compression device. The briquetting machine 1 has a portal like configuration and a vertical compacting ram 5 arranged to penetrate a side intake feed chamber 6 and a vertical axis die 11 . A closure anvil 15 is mov able under the die 11 . The die 11 is mounted with a small clearance in the die holder and has an indentation along one generatrix of the outer surface. Thus, the die 11 will be ruptured along the generatrix line during the com pression stroke. This does not jeopardize functionality but rather makes die replacement easier. The vertical arrange ment eliminates eccentric wear as due to the weight of the horizontally moving elements of known briquetting machi nes, and facilitates the intaking of the precompressed mate rial.
