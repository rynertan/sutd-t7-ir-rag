# Apparatus for controlling subsea well template production systems.

## Abstract
A plurality of subsea wells 67a 67n mounted on well templates and a plurality of satellite wells 11a 11h are con trolled by a small number of electrical and hydraulic lines 18 between a surface control unit 17 and a riser base 12 on the seafloor. An electrical cable between the riser base and the surface control unit provides electrical signals which control a plurality of electrohydraulic control modules on the well tem plates and on the riser base. These control modules provide hydraulic control signals to the subsea wells and to the riser base. The electrohydraulic control modules are replaceable us ing surface operated running tools. A single hydraulic control line between the surface control unit and a corresponding one the satellite wells provides control of the operation of that well through a matrix switching circuit.
