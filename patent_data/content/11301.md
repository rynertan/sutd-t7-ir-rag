# Composition and method for labelling red blood cells with radioactive technetium process and kit for preparing the composition.

## Abstract
A non radioactive composition for intracorporeal label ing of red blood cells with radioactive technetium, which comprises a at least one of pyridoxal and its salts, b at least one stannous salt and c at least one Î± amino acid as the essential components, of which the administeration through a vein in a living body can assure an efficient intracorporeal labeling of red blood cells in the living body with radioactive technetium which is subsequently administered through the vein.
