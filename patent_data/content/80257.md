## Description
Electrical control apparatus in Gas Burning appliances This invention relates to electrical control apparatus in gas burning appliances such as gas boilers for domestic central heating systems. In our earlier Specifications Nos. 1,425,646 and 1,489,727 we described and claimed control apparatus for a fanned, gaseous fuel burning appliance, Such control apparatus was employed for initiating the lighting up sequence of the appliance under predetermined conditions and included safety features designed to avoid dangerous performance characteristics. Control apparatus such as described have been employed commercially in our successful wall mounted Netaheat Registered Trade Mark doustic gas boiler. We have now improved further upon such known control apparatus and particularly have been able to reduce the number of mechanical components which should provide improved reliability. In particular, the improved apparatus now eliminates one mechanical relay and switch relay coil 23 and switches 23A, B and C of Specification No. 1, 489,727 and the heat sensitive probe and expansible bellows unit 11 and 12 of Specification No.1,489,727 . According to the present invention there is provided a control apparatus in a fanned, gaseous fuel burning appliance which comprises a first electrically operable gas valve for controlling flow of gas to a lighting jet, an electrical ignition means including an electrode for igniting gas at said jet, a main gas burner disposed adjacan said lighting jet, a second electrically operable gas valve for controlling flow of gas to said main burner, a sensor for detecting the existence or non existence of a predetermined air flow created by an electrically driven fan means, first and second changeover switch means each having a normally closed pair of contacts and a third normally open contact, and electrical circuitry for initiating a predetermined lighting up sequence, the first switch means being actuated by the air flow sensor when the latter senses the predetermined air flow, and the second switch means being actuated in response to a change in the electrical characteristic at said electrode which occurs in the presence thereat of a flame, the normally open contact of the first switch means being connected to the common dontact of the second switch means, the normallyclosed contacts of the second switch means being connected upon the passage of electrical current therethrough, to actuate the first gas valve, and the normally open contact of the second switch means being connected, upon the passage of electrical current therethrough to actuate the second gas valve. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows the preferred control apparatus in its OFF condition andFigure 2 shows it in its ON or running condition. The control apparatus is shown incorporated in a domestic, fanned, gas burning hot water boiler. The drawings have been arranged in a manner somewhat similar to that shown in Figures 1 and 2 of Specifications 1,425,646 and 1,489,727. A detailed description of the many common components is hence not necessary here it may be obtained from these earlier Specifications However, the various integers are identified as follows boiler casing 2, combustion chamber 4, aerated type main burner 6, main gas jet 8, air intake 10, heat exchanger unit 12, electrically driven air fan 14, air conduit 16, lighting jet 18, spark ignition electrode 20, main burner gas valve 22, main burner lighting jet gas valve 24, isolating cock 26, diaphragm type pressure sensor 28, pressure sensor pipes 30, restrictor 32, programmer 34, water temperature thermostat sensing element 36, high tension cable 38, lighting jet supply pipe 40, thermostat switch 42, pressuresensor switch S3, two way switch S. The gas valves 22 and 24 are electroagnetically operated, the relay components being indicated at S2 and S1 respectively. Switch S has a pair of normally closed contacts Figure 1 across which is provided a resistorR exactly for the same purpose as the resistor R across switch S4 in the circuit shown in Specification No. 1,489t727. Switch S is controlled by a relay RLA 1. Also provided are a flame failure and detection circuit A, an electronic igniter circuit B, and an electronic proving circuit C. These are described in more detail below. Commencing from the OFF condition illustrated inFigure 1, the lighting sequence for the boiler is as follows a When the programmer 34 and thermostat sensing element 36 call for heat, thermostat switch 42 closes to apply a live connection to the common central connection of S3, to the fan 14, and to the primary of transformerTR1. Transformer TRl already connected to the neutral line provides a small sinusoidal voltage to the flame failure and detection circuit A. b The live connection via S3 is returned to electronic proving circuit C, which is a semiconductor switch for the neutral line. Circuit C is shown schematically as a switch. This live connection triggers the semiconductor switch of C to provide a neutral connection to fan 14, to the relays SX and S2 and to the igniter circuit B. c The fan commences to operate and the differential pressure is applied gradually to the diaphragm of the pressure sensor 28. The rate of increase in pressure across the diaphragm is controlled by the restrictor 32 which may be in either of pipes 30 . d At a prede.termined differentia l pressure across the diaphragm, the switch S3 changes over from the position shown in Figure 1 to that shown in Figure 2. This provides a live connection to relay S1 via switch S.This causes valve 24 to open Simultaneously, a live connection is provided via switch S to the electronic igniter circuit B, which now provided with Live and neutral connect ons provides via transformer TR2 the high tension voltage to energise spar.k ignition electrode 20. The lighting jet 18 ignites. e When a flame is present at the jet 18, a change in the electrical characteristic at electrode 20 are detected by the flame and failure and detection circuit A. The latter senses this characteristic at the low end of the secondary winding of TR2, but only when a live connection is present at the common connection of switch S via switch S3 see Figure 2 and the connection from the common connection of S to circuit A . When the appropriate change in electrode characteristics are detected, circuitA energises RLArl to change switch S from the position shown in Figure 1 to that shown in Figure 2 This changeover provides a live connection to relay S2 which causes valve 22 to open. Relay S1 remains open via resistor R seeSpecification No. 1,489,727 . Gas passes to the main burner 6 where it is ignited from the lighting jet 18. Once the demand for heat is satisfied, the thermostat switch 42 opens to remove a live connection to the apparatus. The various switches then revert to their positions shown in Figure 1 and valves S1 and S2 close. Electronic proving circuit C is, as explained, a semiconductor switch triggered from S3 and conveniently comprises a triac as the switch element Electronic igniter circuit B, when appropriately energised, provides as is known in the art the necessary momentary voltage to transformer TR2 to energise electrode 20. The flame failure and detection circuit consists of an astable oscillator controlled from the secondary winding of TR2 and a transistor amplifier which amplifies and applies the oscillator output to RLA 1. In the absence of a flarne at lighting jet 18, the astable oscillator receives only a small sinusoidal voltage from TR1. A flame however changes the electrical characteristics at electrode 20 in effect the flame has the characteristics of a diode and a resistor to provide a change of voltage at the end of the secondary TR2 adjacent circuit A. This changes the voltage controlling the astable oscillator from the small sinusoidal voltage to a negative DC supply. This triggers the oscillator and the amplified output energisesRLA 1, to changeover switch S as described. A modification to the circuit shown in Figures 1 and 2 is illustrated in Figure 3, where the components are shown in the OFF condition, i.e. similar to Figure 1. The Figure 3 circuit differs from that shown inFigures 1 and 2 in two main respects. Firstly, the thermostat switch 42 is inserted into the switching control line of electronic proving circuit C as opposed to the live supply line from programmer 34. Secondly, a flame failure and detection circuit A is employed based upon aSchmitt trigger configuration rather than an astable oscillator, and this enables transformer TR1 to be omitted. Otherwise, the connections are as shown and the circuit functions exactly as the previous embodiment. In more detail the flame failure and detection circuit comprises a filter circuit which removes HT spikes from the sinusoidal power supply. The filtered supply is applied to a transistor amplifier which includes the Schmitt trigger The output of the amplifier is fed to RLA 1. In the absence of a flame at lighting jet 18, the Schmitt trigger remains deenergised. The presence of a flame charges the electrical characteristic of electrode 20, as before, to provide a suffieient change in voltage to the flame failure and detection circuit to fire the Schmitt trigger. The amplified output of the latter energies RLA l.
