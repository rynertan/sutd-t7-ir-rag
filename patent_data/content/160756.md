# Vacuum package tester and method.

## Abstract
A vacuum package tester 10 is capable of providing data from which the internal pressure and volume of residual gas within a flexible wall vacuum package P exposed to atmospheric pressure may be calculated. A container 12 partially filled with liquid is surrounded by a deformation absorbing enclosure 15 . A vacuum pump 14 reduces the pressure in the head space above the liquid, thereby causing a submerged package P to expand. Pressure gauges 19, 20 record the respective pressures in the head space when the package expands by first and second predetermined volumes.
