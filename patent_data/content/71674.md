# PTO lever arrangement for a tractor.

## Abstract
A PTO lever 10 operates a PTO valve via a link 24 and the PTO drive is disengaged and engaged in positions 10 and 10A respectively. The valve is biased to disengage the drive arrow 24A but is held engaged by hydraulically , biased detend balls so that there is automatic disengage ment if hydraulic pressure is lost. To prevent inadvertent knocking of the lever 10 to engaged, e.g. when it is mount ed through the dashboard 16 on the offside of the steering wheel, its pivot hole 26 is slotted and a tension spring 28 pulls a roller 42 on the lever into a slot 40 in a fixed sector 36 when the lever is disengaged. To select engaged the lever has to be pulled out to position 10B before it can be swung up to position 10A . Free automatic return to disen gaged on loss of pressure is not impeded because the roller 42 runs freely on the edge 38 of the sector 36 .
