# A cuboid packing box.

## Abstract
A cuboid packing box is formed by a net of six linked panels 10 ... 15 in T formation. Each panel has an outer layer of card which is common to all, and an individual tile, with mitred edges, of an expanded plastics material. The end panels have lips 21 and close over the four walls. The tiles on adjacent panels have a distinct spacing when flat which ensures accurate closing of the box.

## Claims
Claims 1. A cuboid packing box formed by a net of six linked panels 10,..15 , each panel comprising an outer layer 17 . of card which is common to all panels and an individual inner softer layer 18 having mitred edges adhered to the card, wherein a row of four wall panels 10,..13 when erected form a rectangular configuration open at opposite ends, and two end panels f14,15 having upstanding lips 21 engage the outside of the wall panels when they are closed over those ends, and wherein there is a spacing 5 in each case between the individual inner layers of adjacent panels. 2.

## Description
A Cuboid Packing BoxThis invention relates to a cuboid packing box, for use in sending small articles by mail.For sending small, and pa rticularly flat, articles by mail, one can buy a padded envelope which gives protection to the article and is itself strong enough not to be seriously damaged by the handling it receives. Such envelopes can normally be re used at least a few times.However, if the article to be mailed is not flat, but has a substantial third dimension, such envelopes are not of use.Proposals are also known e.g. GB Patent 1583324 and USPatent 4010865, for knock down boxes having an interior layer of a foamed material for heat insulating purposes. These boxes are intended for consignments of perishable goods such as fish and fruit, and consequently are of a size, wall thickness and weight which is substantially greater than is useful for the present application.If actually produced according to the teaching of these prior documents, considerable force is required to erect a box, which is not suitable for articles sold to the public including the elderly. Moreover, there is a danger of the corners of the box being damaged and splitting.The invention aims to provide a box which has sufficient strength to go through the mail, which provides a relatively soft interior to prevent damage, and which can be erected without the exertion of force.Accordingly, there is provided a cuboid packing box formed by a net of six linked panels, each panel comprising an outer layer of card which is common to all panels and an individual inner softer layer having mitred edges adhered to the card, wherein a row of four wall panels when erected form a rectangular configuration open at opposite ends, and two end panels having upstanding lips engage the outside of the wall panels when they are closed over those ends, and wherein there is a spacing in each case between the individual inner layers of adjacent panels.Such a box can be sold entirely flat, and is provided with appropriate tabs provided as necessary with double sided adhesive tape. However, the provision of the spacing between the individual inner layers allows the box to be erected without the exertion of force and damage to the corners.In order that the invention shall be clearly understood, an exemplary embodiment thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig.l shows a packing box according to the invention opened flat Fig.2 shows a part section on A A in Fig.l Fig.3 shows a section on B B in Fig.l with the lips erected Fig.4 shows a scrap view of the linkage between two panels to a larger scale and Fig.5 shows a corner of the box when erected.A cuboid packing box has six panels 10 15 linked to form a net 16 when opened flat. Each panel comprises a cardboard outer layer 17, to which is glued an inner, softer layer 18. The outer layer is, for example, Eflute corrugated card the inner layer is, for example, extra hard, small bead expanded polystyrene in the form of an injection moulded tile. Expanded polyurethane and expanded polyethylene might also serve as suitable materials. The outer layers of all the panels are continuous, thus forming the net 16, the panels being linked at the fold lines 19. Each tile 18 at each edge 20 is bevelled or mitred at exactly 450, as seen inFig.4, which also shows that each tile, forming the inner layer 18, is slightly smaller than the dimensions of the outer layer 17 to which it is attached.It will also be noted that, apart from the gap between adjacent tiles, the outer layer 17 of panels 14 and 15 is slightly larger than those of panels 10 to 13. This is to allow for the thickness of the walls when the top and bottom are closed.The outer layers 17 of the two panels 14,15 are extended on three sides by tabs 21 which are folded up at right angles to form lips 21a on those three sides.Extensions 22 on two of the tabs are folded round and glued to hold the lips in position. A further tab 23 may be provided on panel 10 or 13 for securing the box.Areas of double sided adhesive tape 24, each one covered by a release paper are provided so that a user does not need to supply tape or glue. The net 16 can be erected to form the walls of a box by folding adjacent wall panels 10 to 13 to form a hollow square tube, and then folding up panels 14 and 15 to close the ends. The lips 21 then overlap the wall panels 10 to 13 and normally the springiness of these panels will by friction hold the box in its erected state. But if tab 23 is provided, this will on its own secure the tube even when the ends are open.In fact, the solidity of the box depends upon it being very accurately dimensioned. The critical factors in this are that the corresponding sides of the panels are of exactly the same dimensions, that the mitres are at exactly 450, and that the dimension s between tiles 18 Fig.4 exactly permits the folding of two adjacent panels so that the mitres close exactly together as in Fig.5 . In order to retain the box closed for use in sending an article through the mail, sections of double sided sticky tape 24 are fixed on the inner surfaces of the lips 21a. These are covered by a release paper until needed. When the box is finally to be closed for mailing, the cover on each section is removed, the panel closed and pressure applied from the outside to cause the inside surfaces of the lips to adhere to the outside surfaces of the wall panels. If this is in practice deemed insufficient, any additional desired external securement can be used.In practice, a box as described has very great strength despite being very light, a necessary quality to avoid postal charges. It may use any suitable materials of any suitable thickness for the inner and outer layers. Normally, but depending upon the nature of the outer surface, no outer wrapping of the packing box will be required and mailing instructions can be written on the outer surface itself. In addition, the configuration of the net of f panels renders the box self evident to assemble. The box although illustrated as a cube, can have any desired proportions. Since it can be stored opened out before use, it is economical of space in manufacture, storage and transport. It is suitable for retail sale to users through post offices, department stores and stationers, for example, and can also be used as a protective box by shops e.g. china shops, in which to give customers their purchases.The net is advantageously of the T shape shown, because this provides the possibility of the most economical tesselation of shapes for production purposes, ensuring minimum waste of card.
