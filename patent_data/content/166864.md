# Floating gang rotary slitting device.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes a first arbor shaft 20 for mounting and rotatably driving a first rotary cutter. The first cutter is comprised of at least one rotary knife element 30 having two opposite side faces, 34, 35 and the first arbor shaft 20 is constructed to allow axially movement of the knife element 30 along the first arbor shaft 20 . A second arbor shaft 22 mounts and rotatably drives a second rotary cutter 14 . The second rotary cutter 14 is comprised of at least one rotary knife element 28 which has two opposite side faces 32 and is movable axially along the second arbor shaft 22 . The second arbor shaft 22 is also selectively movable radially with respect to the first arbor shaft 20 to provide a selected intermeshing overlap region 40 between the first cutter knife element 30 and the second cutter knife element 28 . A resilient force means 42 resiliently urges the first cutter knife element 30 axially along the first arbor shaft 20 to contact the second cutter knife 28 , thereby providing a selected contact pressure and a substantially zero clearance between each pair of intermeshing faces of the first 30 and second cutter knife elements 28 at the overlap region.
