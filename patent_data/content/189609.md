# Optical connector device.

## Abstract
The device includes a first connector housing 7 in which end portions of a number of optical fibres 1 are secured and a second connector housing 11 in which a corresponding number of optical elements to be connected to the fibres, for example end portions of further optical fibres 3 , is secured. After the connection has been estab lished, the two connector housings 7, 11 are detachably coupled by means of a locking device which includes a first locking portion 17 which is provided at the first end 16 of a lever 15 provided on the first connector housing 17 and a second locking portion 19 which cooperates with the first locking portion and which is provided on the second connector housing 11 . In order to establish also an electrical connection between pairs of conductors 35, 41 , an electrical contact member 27, 37 is provided near each of the two locking portions 17, 19 . In the locked condition, these contact members 27, 37 are electrically intercon nected they are separated from one another upon un locking.
