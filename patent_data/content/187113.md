# CORD LOCK DEVICE

## Abstract
A device for retaining two cords 11 , which may be op posite ends of a single cord, against longitudinal movement in a predetermined direction, and including an actuating member 13 connected to a body 12 for pivotal movement between locking and released positions, and two separate locking members 15, 16 carried by the actuating member 13 for pivotal movement therewith and engaging the two cords 11 respectively to retain them against movement. Each of the locking members 15, 15 is also free for pivotal movement relative to the actuating member 13 and relative to the other locking member in a manner automatically tight ening the grip on the corresponding cord 11 in response to the application of longitudinal pulling force to the cord. The actuating member 13 and locking members 15, 15 are connected to the body of the device by a pivot pin 17 which extends between two side walls 18, 19 of the body 12 and through a tubular mounting portion 46 of the actuating member 13 and is preferably retained in assembled posi tion by a snap detent arrangement.
