# AUTOMATIC CLUTCH CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A control system for a hydraulic clutch comprises a start ing valve and a complete engagement control valve coupled with the starting valve. The starting valve supplies to the clutch a regulated fluid pressure which is elevated in accordance with a revolution speed of an engine when it is in a start fluid pres sure regulating state and which is higher than the regulated fluid pressure provided in said start fluid pressure regulating state when it is in said complete engagement fluid pressure re gulating state when it is in a complete engagement fluid pres sure regulating state. The complete engagement control valve shifts the starting valve from the start fluid pressure regulating state to the complete engagement fluid pressure regulating state when the vehicle speed exceeds a complete engage ment vehicle speed.
