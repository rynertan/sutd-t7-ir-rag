# A continuous process for wet oxidation of aqueous waste liquors.

## Abstract
A continuous process for wet oxidation of aqueous waste liquors using oxygen gas is made safer by injecting an inert gas 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 into the waste liquors at a rate such that oxygen in the gas phase is diluted by the sum of generated water vapor, produced carbon dioxide and in jected inert gas to a concentration less than required for spontaneous combustion at every location in the wet oxidation system comprising a reactor 4 , effluent line 6, 7, 7a , pressure control valve 8 and separator 9 , having surfaces not continually exposed to a continuous liquid water phase.
