# METHOD OF REPAIRING PLASTIC TRANSPARENCIES

## Abstract
A process for repairing damaged, that is scratched, surfaces of optically transparent plastic substrates such as polycarbonate windows or windshields of aircraft, comprises sanding the defects in the damaged surface of the substrate and applying a film of an optical grade transparent plastic material such as an acrylic plastic to the sanded surface of the substrate, by means of a clear liquid adhesive such as a silicone adhesive. Excess liquid adhesive is removed together with any bubbles and the adhesive is cured to bond the plastic film to the transparent substrate. The adhesive is chosen so that the cured adhesive has a refractive index which matches the refractive index of the substrate, thereby rendering the scratches substantially invisible, and providing clear visibility through the resulting substrate and plastic film thereon. As an additional feature of the invention, the protective plastic film can be applied to new, undamaged surfaces of transparent plastic substrates as an easily replaceable outer protective ply.
