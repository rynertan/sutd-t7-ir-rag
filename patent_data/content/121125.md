# Oxidation stable, light colored glycerol ester of modified rosin.

## Abstract
Glycerol esters of modified rosin are useful tackifiers in rubber adhesive compositions. Esters made with rosin modi fied by reducing the abietic acid concentration to 5 or less, will retain tackifying properties for longer periods of storage before use.
