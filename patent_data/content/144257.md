## Description
This invention relates to the utilization of highly viscous hydrocarbons, including heavy crude oils and residual oils. Furthermore, this invention relates to the combustion of pre atomized fuels which include both hydrocarbosols and other viscous hydrocarbon in water emulsions. Transportation of highly viscous hydrocarbons via conventional pipelines or other methods, including tankers and barges, presently cannot be accomplished practically without reduction of the viscosity of the hydrocarbons to put them into a pumpable form. This invention presents an alternative means to viscosity reduction, potentially more economical than methods requiring heating or dilution with lighter petroleum stocks. Formation of hydrocarbon in water emulsions effectively reduces the viscosity of heavy hydrocarbon materials, thereby facilitating shipping and pumping with conventional equipment, as well as Under circumstances where transportation distances from production location to utilization sites are considerable, giving rise to long transit times and or the potential for shutdowns en route, or where long storage periods are required, the use of hydrocarbosols is especially advantageous. Because the microbial bioemulsifiers predominantly reside at the hydrocarbon water interface, essentially covering the surface of the hydrocarbon droplets, the hydrocarbon droplets are effectively protected from coalescence and the reduced viscosity of the hydrocarbosols is effectively maintained over time. The substantial stability and improved pumpability of the hydrocarbosols allows them to be transported practically over long distances or remain stationary for long periods of time prior to utilization. While large quantities of high quality, relatively inexpensive, light crude oils presently are recoverable from world wide geographical locations, ever increasing consumption of petroleum fuels and other petroleum products and the energy crisis precipitated by such high demands have brought interest to bear on the enormous reserves of low gravity, viscous hydrocarbons which also exist throughout the world. Viscous hydrocarbons present in natural deposits have been generally classified as viscous crude oils, bitumen or tar and have been variously called heavy crudes, native bitumen, natural bitumen, oil sands, tar sands, bituminous sands or deposits and natural asphalts, all of which materials are chemically gradational and nearly indistinguishable without standardized analyses. For a discussion of the general characteristics of viscous hydrocarbons and the problem of precisely defining or classifying them, see Meyer, Introduction in The Future of Heavy Crude and Tar Sands, p. 1, Mining Informational Services, McGraw Hill, Inc., New York 1981 . See also Section 6.2 The geographical distribution of heavy crude reserves is given in Table I abstracted from Meyer and Dietzman 1981 , World Geography of Heavy Crude Oils, in The Future of Heavy Crude and Tar Sands, pp. 16 28, Mining Informational Services, McGraw Hill, Inc., New York 1981 . The total estimated figure for oil in place is 6200 x 10⁹ barrels 1 barrel 164 ℓ . Venezuela heads the list with roughly half of this total, 3000 x 10⁹ barrels. Canada follows closely with 2950 x 10⁹ barrels this total includes hydrocarbon in bitumen , while the United States has an estimated 77 x 10⁹ barrels. To put these figures in perspective, the total world reserves of oil lighter than 20 API is estimated to be about 660 x 10⁹ barrels. Yet undiscovered reserves are estimated at 900 x 10⁹ barrels. Thus, heavy crude is more plentiful than conventional oil by about a factor of four. Further considering the amount of heavy residual oils that result from the processing of conventional crudes, the amount of heavy oils that exists worldwide is very great indeed. It is clear that reserves of conventional light crudes are being depleted much faster than heavy crudes and that development of world reserves of viscous hydrocarbons will eventually become necessary to support world petroleum demands. Significant production of heavy crudes has begun, primarily by steam assisted enhanced recovery methods. For example, recent estimates place production of heavy crude oil in California at 250,000 barrels per day. Future estimates Barnea, The Future of Heavy Crude and Tar Sands, in The Future of Heavy Crude and Tar Sands, pp. 13 15, Mining Informational Services, McGraw Hill, Inc., New York 1981 project that by the year 2000, production of heavy oil plus the bitumen from tar sands will increase to one third of the world s total oil production. Such rapid development of heavy oil resources will extend the petroleum era and should 1 allow products from heavy crudes to benefit from the existing energy infrastructure 2 assure fuel supplies to the transportation sector and feed stock to petrochemical plants 3 be a stabilizing factor for world petroleum prices, increasing the number of oil producing countries 4 reduce the strategic and political aspects of oil production and 5 postpone the need for massive investments in coal conversion and other facilities for synthetic oil production. The problem of transporting viscous hydrocarbons, be it out of a producing well, off a tanker or, especially, through a pipeline, is one of pumpability. Consequently, methods for transporting viscous hydrocarbons such as heavy crude oils have focused on modifying the oil into a pumpable form. Two general approaches have been considered. For waxy crudes, it is desirable to transport the oil above its pour point, i.e., above the temperature at which wax crystals in the oil inhibit its ability to flow. One method directed to this end is the use of pour point depressants to reduce the pour point and maintain fluidity. Generally, this method is of value only with those oils of sufficiently low viscosities to permit transportation at ambient temperatures. For highly viscous crudes, the approach taken has been to reduce the viscosity. When the crude is to be transported by pipeline, the viscosity must be sufficiently reduced to flow through conventional lines using conventional pumping equipment. Several methods have been used to reduce the viscosities of heavy crude oils for pipelining purposes. These methods include preparation of oil solid slurries, mixing water with oil to form reduced viscosity emulsions, heating the oil to lower its viscosity and diluting the oil with low viscosity hydrocarbons such as condensate, gasoline, or naphtha Sloan Reported methods for reducing the viscosities of viscous hydrocarbons by forming oil in water emulsions for the purposes of transporting them through pipelines or pumping them from wells have involved the use of chemical additives. Among the chemicals which have been proposed or used are bases such as sodium hydroxide or ammonia U.S. Patents No. 3,380,531 3,487,844 and 3,006,354 , nonionic surfactants U.S. Patents Nos. 3,425,429 and 3,467,195 and combinations of nonionic and anionic surfactants U.S. Patents Nos. 4,239,052 and 4,249,554 . Instability of oil in water emulsions can present a problem for instance, oil in water emulsions are known to break or invert into unpumpable forms. Increasing the amount of chemicals used to maintain stability can result in prohibitive costs. It is notable that in a recent review of methods for pipelining heavy crude oils see Sloan The vast majority of combustible emulsions known in the art are water in oil emulsions, primarily consisting of relatively small amounts of water 1 10 by volume in oil to enhance combustion. Some combustible oil in water emulsions have been described see e.g., U.S. Patents Nos. 3,958,915 4,273,611 and 4,382,802 . Notably, however, the oil phases used have been light, low viscosity fuels and other low viscosity oils, e.g., kerosene, gasoline, gas oil, fuel oils and other oils which are liquid at room temperature. Combustible thixotropic jet fuels and other safety fuels have been described in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,352,109 3,490,237 and 4,084,940. Under resting stationary conditions, these oil in water emulsions are in the form of gels with apparent rest viscosities of 1.Pa.s 1000 cps and preferably 50 Pa.s 100 Pa.s 50,000 100,000 cps . These thixotropic oil in water emulsions exhibit low viscosities under high pumping high shear rates. Many microbes can utilize hydrocarbon as their sole source of carbon for growth and energy production. The hydrocarbon substrates may be linear, branched, cyclic or aromatic. In order to rapidly assimilate such water insoluble substrates, the microbes require a large contact area between themselves and the oil. This is achieved by emulsifying the oil in the surrounding aqueous medium. Hydrocarbon degrading microbes frequently synthesize and excrete surface active agents which promote such emulsification. For example, the growth of Gutnick Cooper and Zajic Adv. Appl. Microbiol. EP A 0 016 546 suggests an emulsan for forming oil in water emulsion of hydrocarbon oils. US A 3 519 006, US A 3 630 953, US A 4 239 052, US A 4 265 264 disclose oil in water emulsion of hydrocarbon oils to permit highly viscous hydrocarbon to be readily transported but does not disclose burning the emulsions. US A 3 958 915 discloses a mehtod for burning certain emulsions for control of pollution. The object of the invention is the use for burning of combustible pre atomized fuels comprising a hydrocarbon in water emulsion characterized by the fact that said hydrocarbon in water emulsion was formed by using an effective amount of surfactant package comprising at least one water soluble surfactant, said hydrocarbon in water emulsion i comprising a hydrocarbon characterized by a viscosity of 82 Pa.S 8200 centipoise or greater at 26,6 C 80 F and particularly 1.O Pa.S 1000 centipoise or greater at 100 C 212 F , and ii having a hydrocarbon water ratio from 60 40 to 90 10 by volume. In an embodiment, the object of the invention is the use for burning of pre atomized fuels comprising a hydrocarbon in water emulsion characterized by the fact that said hydrocarbon in water emulsion was formed by using an effective amount of surfactant package comprising at least one water soluble surfactant, said hydrocarbon in water emulsion i comprising a hydrocarbon characterized by an API gravity of about 20 API or less, viscosity of about 1.0 Pa.S 1000 centipoise or greater at 100 C 212 F , paraffin content of about 50 by weight or less and aromatic content of about 15 by weight or greater and ii having a hydrocarbon water ratio from 60 40 to 90 10 by volume. In an embodiment the hydrocarbon is further characterized by a paraffin content ranging from about 4 to about 40 by weight, an aromatic content ranging from about 15 to about 70 by weight and an asphaltene content ranging from about 5 to about 80 by weight. The term hydrocarbosol is defined as any bioemulsifier stabilized hydrocarbon in water emulsion wherein the individual hydrocarbon droplets are essentially surrounded or covered by water soluble bioemulsifier molecules predominantly residing at the hydrocarbon water interface, which bioemulsifier molecules form an effective barrier against droplet coalescence and hence promote the maintenance of discrete hydrocarbon droplets suspended or dispersed in the continuous, low viscosity aqueous phase. The term water soluble is defined to include water dispersible substances. The term viscous hydrocarbon, it is to be understood, also encompasses the following nomenclature vacuum residuals, vis breaker residuals, catalytic cracker residuals, catalytic hydrogenated residuals, coker residuals, ROSE residual oil supercritical extraction residuals, tars and cut back tars, bitumen, pitch and any other terms describing residuals of hydrocarbon processing.

The term bioemulsifier is defined as any biologically derived substance which, by virtue of any combination of characteristics including, but not limited to, high molecular weight, polymeric nature, highly specific three dimensional structure, hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties and sparing solubility in hydrocarbons, binds tightly to the hydrocarbon water interface and essentially covers the surface of individual hydrocarbon droplets in hydrocarbon in water emulsions, effectively maintaining discrete droplets and preventing coalescence, and thereby imparting substantial stability to hydrocarbon in water emulsions. An example of a bioemulsifier is α emulsan. The term biosurfactant is defined as any biologically derived substance which reduces the interfacial tension between water and a hydrocarbon and, as a result, reduces the energy requirement mixing energy for creation of additional interfacial area. An example of a biosurfactant is a glycolipid. The term surfactant package defines a composition that may comprise a chemical surfactant or a combination of chemical co surfactants or a combination of co surfactant s and biosurfactant s or a combination of chemical surfactant s and bioemulsifier s or a combination of chemical surfactant s , biosurfactant s and bioemulsifier s , and which may also include chemical emulsion stabilizers, and which may be in aqueous form. The term emulsans, which reflects the polysaccharide structure of these compounds and the exceptional bioemulsifier activity of these materials, generically identifies those capsular extracellular microbial protein associated lipoheteropolysaccharides produced by The term α emulsans defines those extracellular microbial protein associated lipopolysaccharides produced by The term β emulsans defines those extracellular microbial protein associated lipopolysaccharides produced by The term psi emulsans defines the O deacylated extracellular protein associated microbial polysaccharides obtained from the emulsans, the protein free components of such psi emulsans being completely N acylated heteropolysaccharides made up of major amounts of D galactosamine and an aminouronic acid and containing from 0 to 1 percent of fatty acid esters in which, when present, the fatty acids contain from about 10 to about 18 carbon atoms.

The surfactant packages of this invention can be formulated with a wide variety of chemical and microbial surface active agents and are preferably formulated with water soluble surface active agents to provide for the formation of oil in water, as opposed to water in oil, emulsions. The surfactant packages can be formulated with numerous chemical surfactants, used alone or in conjunction with chemical co surfactants of the same type e.g., a combination of water soluble nonionic surfactants or of different types e.g., a combination of water soluble nonionic, anionic, cationic and or amphoteric surfactants , and can be further formulated in combination with a a water soluble biosurfactant or combination of biosurfactants as co surfactant s and or b a water soluble bioemulsifier or combination of bioemulsifiers as emulsion stabilizer s . In certain instances, chemical emulsion stabilizers may also be used in place of bioemulsifiers. It is also possible to formulate surfactant packages comprising only microbial surface active agents, i.e., combinations of biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers. The surfactant packages of this invention vary with the type of viscous oil to be emulsified. The following general compositions are offered by way of illustration. For viscous crudes, surfactant packages can be formulated to comprise at least one chemical surfactant and at least one bioemulsifier. They can also be formulated to comprise at least one water soluble nonionic surfactant, at least one water soluble anionic surfactant, and at least one bioemulsifier. For viscous residuals, surfactant packages can be formulated to comprise at least one water soluble non ionic surfactant or at least one anionic surfactant or combinations of non ionic surfactants and anionic surfactants and which can further comprise biosurfactants and or bioemulsifiers. The types of water soluble nonionic chemical surfactants suitable for use in the surfactant packages are listed in Table III. In surfactant packages for viscous crudes, the preferred water soluble nonionic chemical surfactants are ethoxylated alkyl phenols and ethoxylated alcohols. In surfactant packages for viscous residuals, the preferred water soluble nonionic surfactants are, again, ethoxylated alkyl phenols and also polyoxyalkylated amines. The ethoxylated alkyl phenols are of the general formula The ethoxylated alcohols are of the the general formula The polyoxyalkylated amines are of the general formula The types of water soluble anionic chemical surfactants suitable for use in the surfactant packages of this invention are listed in Table IV. In surfactant packages for both viscous crudes and viscous residuals, the preferred water soluble anionic chemical surfactants are sulfonated or sulfated forms of nonionic surfactants. In surfactant packages for viscous crudes, ethoxylated alcohol sulfates are preferred. In surfactant packages for viscous residuals, sulfonated or sulfated ethoxylated alkylphenols and ethoxylated alcohol sulfates are preferred. In surfactant packages for both viscous crudes and viscous residuals, alkylaryl sulfonates are also preferred anionic chemical surfactants. The ethoxylated and sulfated alcohols are of the general formula The sulfated ethoxylated alkylphenols are of the general formula An example of a particularly preferred sulfated ethoxylated alkylphenol is the ammonium salt of a sulfated nonylphenol ethoxylate containing, but not limited to, about 4 ethoxy groups. The alkylaryl sulfonates are of the general formula The preferred water soluble microbial surface active agents for use in the surfactant packages of this invention are any microbial or other biologically derived substances which function as bioemulsifiers, i.e., substances which, by virtue of such characteristics as large molecular weight, polymeric nature, highly specific three dimensional structure, hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature, and sparing solubility in oil, effectively cover the oil water interface maintaining discrete, individual oil droplets in oil in water emulsions thereby substantially stabilizing emulsions from coalescence. Among the preferred bioemulsifiers are heteropolysaccharide biopolymers produced by bacteria of the genus The foregoing Numerous other microbial organisms may possibly serve as a source of biological surface active agents, including biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers, for use in the surfactant packages of this invention. Some of these microorganisms and the types of compounds they produce are listed in Table V, though the list is not exhaustive. The surfactant packages of this invention may also be formulated with water soluble cationic chemical surfactants, including, but not limited to, oxygen free amines, oxygen containing amines, amide linked amines and quaternary ammonium salts. Use of cationic chemical surfactants in conjunction with microbial surface active agents would require that the charge characteristic of the biological compounds be considered. For example, cationic chemical surfactants would probably best be used in conjunction with neutral microbial surface active agents and would probably best not be used in conjunction with the preferred polyanionic heteropolysaccharide bioemulsifiers. Surfactant packages can be formulated from nonionic chemical surfactants or combinations of nonionic and anionic chemical surfactants preferably in about a 1 1 ratio by weight without bioemulsifiers but preferably, for emulsion stabilization, with bioemulsifiers in the range of about 1 to about 50 by weight. Surfactant packages comprising bioemulsifiers in the range of about 10 to about 20 by weight and particularly around 15 by weight are preferred. Examples of surfactant packages are a about 10 to about 15 α emulsan by weight in combination with ethoxylated secondary alcohols having carbon chains of about 11 to about 15 carbon atoms in length e.g., Tergitol 15 S X Union Carbide Corp. , where X represents the number of moles of ethylene oxide and is preferably greater than 7 b about 10 to about 15 α emulsan by weight in combination with about 20 to about 25 by weight of an ethoxylated trimethylnonanol e.g., Tergitol TMN 6 Union Carbide Corp. and about 60 to about 70 by weight of an ethoxylated alkyl phenol e.g., Triton X 114 Rohn Haas Co. and c about 15 α emulsan by weight in combination with an ethoxylated alkyl phenol having an R group of about 8 or 9 carbon atoms e.g., Tergitol NP 40 Union Carbide Corp. . A particularly preferred surfactant package comprises about 10 to about 20 α emulsan by weight in combination with a nonionic ethoxylated alkyl phenol e.g., Tergitol NP 40 ani an anionic ethoxylated alcohol sulfate e.g., Alfonic 1412 A Conoco, Inc. , using the nonionic and anionic surfactants in a proportion of about 1 1. The particularly preferred surfactant packages are exemplified by the surfactant package comprising about 15 by weight emulsan, about 42.5 by weight Tergitol NP 40 and about 42.5 by weight Alfonic 1412 A. Surfactant packages may be formulated full strength or in diluted aqueous solution. The surfactant package most preferred for use with viscous residuals is a combination of anionic surfactants, 85 by weight of an ethoxylated sulfated nonylphenol, and 15 by weight of the sodium salt of a polymerized alkylnaphthalene sulfonic acid with a molecular weight of at least about 500 daltons and preferably at least about 2000 daltons. The surfactant package compositions of this invention can be used to emulsify or emulsify and substantially stabilize numerous viscous hydrocarbons in oil in water emulsions which may be subsequently transported and or directly burned. The fuels of the subject invention are hydrocarbons that have a viscosity of 82 Pa.S 82,000 centipoise or greater at 26.6 C 80 F or more particularly of 1.0 Pa.S 1000 centipoise or greater at 100 C. 212 F . The following hydrocarbons each have a viscosity of greater than about 82 Pa.S 82,000 centipoise at 26.6 C 80 F and are therefore non limiting examples of hydrocarbons falling within the scope of the subject invention Texas Fireflood, Union Cutback, California Vacuum Resid, Oklahoma Vacuum Resid, H Oil, Rose Resid and German Visbreaker Resid. The following hydrocarbons are utilized as comparative examples in the subject application Boscan, Residual N 6 Texas Visbreaker Resid, and Kansas Crude. Also, although not essential, the viscous hydrocarbons can have a paraffin content of about 50 by weight or less and an aromatic content of about 15 by weight or greater. The viscous hydrocarbons can also have a paraffin content in the range from about 4 to about 40 by weight, and aromatic content in the range from about 15 to about 70 by weight and asphaltene content from about 5 to about 80 by weight. The surfactant packages of Section 6.1 can be used to form oil in water emulsions containing as much as about 90 by volume of the viscous hydrocarbons described in Section 6.2. The aqueous phase into which the hydrocarbon is emulsified can be deionized water, water from a municipal source, or any water, even water with relatively large amounts of dissolved solids such as connate waters or brines, normally located in proximity to oil production, transportation or utilization sites. The aqueous phase can also be an alcohol water mixture such as methanol water, ethanol water or other lower alkanol water mixtures, and may further contain additives such as anti corrosion agents, anti pollution agents or combustion improvers. Oil in water emulsions preferably contain oil water ratios of about 60 40 to about 80 20, and more preferably from about 65 35 to about 75 25. In forming oil in water emulsions, it is economically desirable to use as little of the surfactant package as possible while maintaining acceptable emulsion characteristics to suit the particular transportation or utilization requirements. The surfactant packages of Section 6.1 can be used in proportions of surfactant package hydrocarbon from about 1 100 to about 1 20,000 by weight. The proportion used can depend on the type of hydrocarbon to be emulsified and or the purpose for emulsifying it. Oil in water emulsion formation can be brought about by any number of suitable procedures. For example, the aqueous phase containing an effective amount of surfactant package can be contacted with the hydrocarbon phase by metered injection just prior to a suitable mixing device. Metering is preferably maintained such that the desired hydrocarbon water ratio remains relatively constant. Mixing devices such as pump assemblies or in line static mixers can be used to provide sufficient agitation to cause emulsification. As a more specific example, for the transportation or utilization of residual oils, it may be possible to emulsify the hot residual oil in about 30 aqueous phase v v with one of the surfactant packages of Section 6.1 as it exits the vacuum still of a refinery. Some low gravity residual hydrocarbons are extremely viscous and require very high temperatures to make them fluid enough to handle. Such hydrocarbons can be characterized by a viscosity greater than about 1 Pa.s 1000 cp at 100 C 212 F . Maintaining such high temperatures is not economically feasible for the long term storage and transportation of these hydrocarbons. Also, it is not economically feasible to blend these viscous hydrocarbons with much lighter oils cutter stock due to either the quantity of lighter oil required to achieve a viscosity which can be handled or the unfavorable characteristics of the viscous hydrocarbon which do not allow for homogeneous blending of lighter oils. This invention offers a novel approach to handling extremely viscous hydrocarbons by the stable dispersion of such viscous hydrocarbons into water to form pre atomized fuels. Pre atomized fuel formation is achieved by heating the viscous hydrocarbon to a high temperature in order to make it fluid. The hot hydrocarbon phase is brought in contact with the aqueous phase containing appropriate surfactants and or stabilizers as described in Section 6.1. A key to achieving successful pre atomized fuel formation is the maintenance of pressure throughout the entire process such that the aqueous phase is not allowed to vaporize. By maintaining the appropriate pressure, i.e., the pressure required to prevent the water in the aqueous phase from boiling, the aqueous phase remains in a liquid state, thus allowing the stable dispersion of the hydrocarbon phase into a continuous water phase. The resulting hot pre atomized fuel may be rapidly cooled using an appropriate heat exchange device so that the outlet temperature of the pre atomized fuel is below the vaporization temperature of the aqueous phase at ambient pressure. Alternatively, the pressure may be reduced and the mixture cooled by flashing a portion of the water contained in the pre atomized fuel. As is generally known in the refining industry, residual hydrocarbons obtained from the discharge of thermal cracking units have presented unusual problems. The extreme conditions required in processing to obtain greater quantities of high gravity hydrocarbons have resulted in resids which are very susceptible to separation into distinct, non mixable fractions. The reasons for the occurrence of this phenomenon are not fully known however, it is believed that the destabilization of high molecular weight components such as asphaltenes is a contributing factor. When such hydrocarbons are used to form pre atomized fuels as described in Section 6.3., the resulting oil in water emulsion may separate into three phases after a short period of static storage. These phases consist of a low API gravity hydrocarbon bottom phase, a water surfactant middle phase, and a high API gravity hydrocarbon upper phase. Without wishing to be bound or restricted by any particular theory, applicants theorize that the separation may be due to the slow cooling of the pre atomized fuel which allows sufficient time for the occurrence of complex interactions that may be attributed to both sticky state and Ostwald ripening phenomena. The tendency toward separation can be decreased by the use of an appropriate heat exchange device or method to rapidly quench the freshly formed pre atomized fuel to a temperature at least about 37,7 C 100 F below the softening point of the hydrocarbon. By rapidly quenching the oil in water emulsion as it exits the mixing unit, a stable pre atomized fuel is achieved that does not separate with time. It is further theorized that the rapid cooling of the hot pre atomized fuel does not allow sufficient time for the complex interactions stated above to occur. An economical way to increase the btu content of a liquid fuel is achieved by incorporating a high softening point hydrocarbonaceous material such as coal, coke, ROSE residual, etc. into a lower softening point fuel. This is usually accomplished by grinding a high softening point hydrocarbon to form very small particles usually approximately 100 µm in size and then, dispersing the solid particles in the liquid fuel. The dispersion of a solid in a liquid, however, usually results in the production of a fuel with unfavorable characteristics such as increased viscosity. A novel method of economically utilizing a high softening point hydrocarbonaceous material such as coal, coke, ROSE residual, etc. is achieved by incorporating it into a pre atomized fuel. This is accomplished by first grinding a material of high softening point to form very small particles generally less than about 30 µm and then forming a slurry by dispersing the particles in a continuous aqueous phase containing a pre atomized fuel compatible surfactant package. The slurry of dispersed particles is mixed at an appropriate ratio with a pre atomized fuel formulated from a hydrocarbon other than that used to form the slurry. The mixing of a slurry with a pre atomized fuel results in a liquid fuel which has a viscosity lower then either the slurry or the pre atomized fuel prior to mixing. The reasons for the reduced viscosity observed in a slurry pre atomized fuel mixture are not fully known however, without wishing to be bound or restricted by any particular theory, applicants believe that the reduction of particle to particle interaction is a contributing factor. The hydrocarbon droplets of hydrocarbon in water emulsions generally rise to the surface and float on the aqueous phase in a process known as creaming, provided the density of the hydrocarbon phase is less than that of the aqueous phase and the droplets in the dispersed phase are too big to be stabilized by Brownian motion. If the cream remains undisturbed for a given period of time, the droplets coalesce, giving rise to two separate phases. The emulsans, particularly α emulsan, are extremely effective in retarding coalescence and the emulsan stabilized droplets in the cream are easily redispersible in the aqueous phase. The principal factors controlling emulsion stability are electrostatic charge effects and steric effects. The properties of emulsans lend themselves to optimal exploitation of these mechanisms. Their large molecular weight and highly specific three dimensional structure result in an efficient coverage of the hydrocarbon water interface. This effectively prevents oil to oil contact when collisions occur between adjacent droplets. Simultaneously, the polyanionic nature of emulsans causes the surfaces of emulsion droplets to be negatively charged which creates repulsive forces and significantly decreases the collision frequency between hydrocarbon droplets. In addition, the absence of multimolecular emulsan micelles in the water phase and the lack of emulsan solubility in the hydrocarbon phase provides an efficient migration and attachment of the emulsan molecules to the oil water interface. The overall chemical requirements for emulsion stabilization thus become very small and directly related to the oil droplet size, i.e., interfacial area desired. The advantages that emulsans offer over classical emulsion stabilizers may be summarized as follows. In a hydrocarbosol, emulsan predominantly resides at the oil water interface only essentially no measurable emulsan is found in the water phase nor in the oil phase. Very small amounts of emulsan are required, even in the presence of excess water. The emulsan stabilized hydrocarbosol effectively resists inversion to water in oil emulsions, even at water oil ratios of less than about 1 4. This is partly due to emulsans insolubility in oil and may also be due in part to the specific three dimensional structure of the emulsan molecule. In some cases hydrocarbons may be too viscous for conventional processing or have characteristics i.e., low gravity excessive paraffinic, aromatic, and or asphaltic contents etc. which make them unfavorable to incorporate into stable pre atomized fuels. One method to reduce viscosity for processing or alleviate unfavorable characteristics is blending the unfavorable hydrocarbon with one which is favorable resulting in a hydrocarbon having characteristics suitable for pre atomized fuel formation. In this way an otherwise unusable hydrocarbon can be adjusted to a usable form. Hydrocarbosols, because they contain bioemulsifiers, have properties which allow them to be transported in tankers, barges and more importantly through conventional pipelines, including standard, non heated pipeline networks. Among the properties exhibited by hydrocarbosols that are particularly important for pipelining are reduced viscosity, stabilization against coalescence even under considerable rates of shear, compatibile formation with high salinity aqueous phases, and non corrosive nature. Hydrocarbosols with viscosities below about 0.5 Pa.s Once transported to their destination, hydrocarbosols can be demulsified if desired. More importantly, hydrocarbosols like other pre atomized fuels can be utilized directly, without dewatering, as burnable fuels. They can be used in combustion facilities which presently use Number 6 fuel oils, or so called Bunker C oils, to fire, Where long storage periods or transportation over long distances prior to utilization is not required, the stability exhibited by hydrocarbosols becomes less critical. If short distance transportation or on site utilization is contemplated, it may not be necessary to form bioemulsifier stabilized emulsions. Further, it is not necessary to form stabilized emulsions in order to facilitate combustion i.e., emulsion stability is not generally required for good combustion characteristics. Therefore, pre atomized fuels suitable for burning can be made by emulsifying viscous hydrocarbons with the surfactant packages of Section 6.1 which are formulated with a chemical surfactant alone or a combination of chemical surfactants. For instance, a 70 30, Number 6 fuel oil water emulsion can be made with a surfactant package comprising a nonionic chemical surfactant and an anionic chemical surfactant in equal proportion by weight and the resulting oil in water emulsion which can also be referred to as a pre atomized fuel can be burned directly. The α emulsans produced by By another method, enzyme treatment of the α emulsan was performed prior to drum drying according to the folowing protocol. Fermentation broth containing α emulsan resulting from a fermentation of Fermentations of Whole broth and enzyme treated whole broth from fermentations of The Boscan crude oil used in the experiments described The Texas crude oil used in the experiments described The Number 6 residual fuel oil used in the experiment described in Section 7.5 was obtained from the MIT Energy Laboratory Cambridge, Massachusetts . The characteristics of this residual fuel oil, its specific gravity, API gravity, paraffin content, aromatic content, asphaltene content and viscosity versus temperature profile were determined experimentally and are summarized in Table IX. The paraffin, aromatic and asphaltene content were determined by the methods described in Section 7.2.12, The Union cutback tar used in the experiments described The California Vacuum Resid used in the experiments described The Oklahoma vacuum resid used in the experiments described The H oil used in the experiments described The ROSE resid used in the experiments described The German visbreaker used in the experiments described The Texas visbreaker used in the experiments described Viscosity versus temperature profiles were obtained by heating the oils to the given temperatures of Tables VII XIII and XV XVI and measuring viscosities in a Rheomat 30 rheometer Contraves AG , at an approximate shear rate of 30 sec. ¹. The paraffin content and aromatic content of some of the oils of the foregoing examples were determined by a method in which the oil is separated into fractions based on hydrocarbon solubilities in n heptane and methylene chloride. The paraffin fraction is defined as that hydrocarbon fraction which is soluble in n heptane. The aromatic fraction is defined as that hydrocarbon fraction which is soluble in methylene chloride. The materials used are as follows an analytical balance, accurate to 0.1 milligram mg , a 500 millimeter mm burette type chromatography column, tared collection flasks, reagent grade methylene chloride, n heptane 99 mole percent and alumina adsorbent. The alumina was activated by heating it in an oven set at 310 C for 12 14 hours. The alumina was cooled in a dessicator and stored in a tightly capped bottle prior to use. Chromatography columns packed 3 4 full were used. The separation was carried out by quantitatively weighing 500 to 1000 mg 0.1mg of sample oil. Viscous oils were weighed into sample pouches made of tissue paper which were subsequently placed into the column. Non viscous oils are usually weighed directly into the columns. After introduction of the sample oil into the columns, 200 to 250 mℓ of n heptane were allowed to flow through the column. It was preferable for the solvent to be added in a manner which did not excessively disturb the alumnina packing. The eluent was collected in a tared evaporating flask. After all the n heptane had flowed through the column, the first evaporating flask was replaced with another tared flask. Methylene chloride was then introduced into the column and allowed to flow through it. The collected eluents were removed from each flask by vacuum evaporation following appropriate safety precautions. The dry flasks were reweighed and the percentage of paraffins and aromatics were calculated based on the original weight of the oil sample. All samples were run in duplicate. Specific gravity was determined by weighing a measured volume of sample oil and calculating the ratio of the mass of the oil to the mass of an equal volume of water. API gravities were then calculated from the specific gravity by the general formula The methods used to characterize the hydrocarbons of Examples 7.2.1, 7.2.3 through 7.2.10 are essentially the same as those in Section 7.2.11. However, a new procedure was utilized for determining the asphaltic in addition to the paraffinic and aromatic contents of viscous hydrocarbons. It is described below. The paraffin, asphaltene and aromatic contents of the sample hydrocarbons were obtained by a method in which the hydrocarbons are dispersed in n heptane, the asphaltenes removed by filtration and the remaining components separated based on their solubilities in n heptane and methylene chloride. The asphaltene fraction the precipitate is filtered from a dispersion of the hydrocarbon in n heptane. The paraffin fraction is that portion soluble in n heptane. The aromatic fraction is that portion soluble in methylene chloride. The materials used are as folows an analytical balance, accurate to 0.1 milligram mg , a blender Osterizer Galaxy 14 and blades fitted to a 500 mℓ Mason jar, preweighed Whatman 1 paper, filter funnel, rotary evaporation apparatus, a 500 millimeter mm burette type chromatography column, tared collection flasks, reagent grade methylene chloride, n heptane 99 mole percent and alumina adsorbent. The alumina was activated by heating it in an oven at 310 C for 12 14 hours. The alumina was cooled in a dessicator and stored in a tightly capped bottle prior to use. Chromatography columns packed 3 4 full were used. Hydrocarbon samples of 1 2 g were quantitatively added to Mason jars containing 100 mℓ of n heptane. After blending for 1 2 minutes at maximum speed, the jar and its contents were washed with an additional 100 mℓ of n heptane. The dispersed sample was filtered through Whatman 1 paper and the filtrate colected into Erlenmeyer flasks. After introduction of the filtrate to the column, the effluent was collected into a tared evaporation flask. When n heptane was completely eluted, 200 mℓ of methylene chloride was added to the column and the eluted material collected into another tared evaporation flask until the column ran dry. The eluting solvents were removed using a rotating vacuum evaporator at temperatures appropriate to the solvents. The tared filter paper and flasks were reweighed and the percentage of asphaltenes, paraffins, and aromatics were calculated based on the original weight of the sample. Individual samples were run in duplicate. All percentages apearing in the foregoing tables for paraffinic, aromatic and asphaltene content have been adjusted to 100 recovery for comparative purposes. The compositions of five surfactant packages which have been used successfully to emulsify Boscan crude oil are presented in Table XVII. The α emulsan used was a technical grade α emulsan prepared according to the first method described in Section 7.1.1. The chemical surfactants, Tergitol 15 S X where X indicates the number of moles of ethylene oxide , Tergitol TMN 6, Tergitol NP 40 Union Carbide Corp. , Triton X 114 Rohm Haas Co. and Alfonic 1412 A Conoco are commercially available. Emulsions were formed in an Osterizer Galaxy 14 blender at low speed in a manner preventing the beating of air into the emulsion. The ratio of Boscan crude to deionized water was 70 30 by volume v v . The surfactant packages were used successfully over a range of 1 250 1 2,000 surfactant package oil, by weight w w . The surfactant package comprising 15 α emulsan, 42.5 Tergitol NP 40 and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A was considered a preferred surfactant package for use with Boscan crude oil. Emulsions 70 30, Boscan crude deionized water formed with this surfactant package at 1 part per 2,000 parts oil have been observed to be stable and maintain reduced viscosities for a period of at least three weeks. In addition, this surfactant package has been used to form 70 30 Boscan crude water emulsions at as low a treatment rate as 1 part per 20,000 parts oil. Other surfactants which successfully alone or in combination emulsified general type viscous oils included Alfonic 1012 60 Conoco, Inc. , an ethoxylated linear alcohol with chain lengths of 10 to 12 carbon atoms C 0 C 2 and 60 ethoxylation Protowet 4196 Proctor Chemical Co. , a sodium salt of a sulfosuccinate of a nonyl phenol ethoxylate Protowet 4337 Proctor Chemical Co. , sodium dicyclohexyl sulfosuccinate Tween 80 ICI Americas, Inc. , polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monooleate Pluronic F88 BASF Wyandotte , a block copolymer of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide Petronate L Witco Chemical Corp. a sodium petroleum sulfonate and Conoco AXS Conoco, Inc. , ammonium xylene sulfonate. The compositions of several surfactant packages which have been successfully used to emulsify Oklahoma vacuum resid are listed in Table XVIII. The α emulsan used was prepared from a whole broth of emulsan according to the methods described in Section 7.1.2. The surfactants, Tetronic 707 BASF Wyandotte Corp. , Alipal EP 110, CO 436 GAF Corp. , Daxad 17 W. R. Grace Co. Nopcosant Diamond Shamrock , Triton X series and Tamol 850 Rohm Haas Co. , Tergitol NP series Union Carbide Corp. and Conco Sulfate 219 Continental Chemical Co. are commercially available. Emulsions were formed in an Osterizer Galaxy 14 blender at medium speed in a manner preventing the beating of air into the emulsion. The ratio of the Oklahoma vacuum resid to tap water was 70 30 by weight w w . The surfactant packages were used successfully over a range of 1 10 to 1 250 surfactant package oil by weight w w . The surfactant package comprising 15 Daxad 17 and 85 Alipal CO 436 was considered a preferred surfactant package for use with Oklahoma vacuum resid. The emulsion produced with this package has been observed to be stable and maintain a reduced viscosity for at least 5 weeks. This formulation has been used to form a 70 30 resid water emulsion at a treatment as low as 1 part to 750 parts of oil. The residual hydrocarbons described in Sections 7.2.4. through 7.2.10. were successfully emulsified into stable pre atomized fuels with certain of the surfactant packages listed in Table XVIII. For the California and Oklahoma vacuum resids, the preferred surfactant package was Package 19. For the Union cutback tar, the preferred surfactant package was Package 25. Package 18 was preferred for use with the German visbreaker resid and Package 17 was preferred for the Texas visbreaker resid, the ROSE resid and the catalytically hydrogenated residual oil. Table XIX lists the types of oils that have and have not yet been successfully emulsified into stable emulsions see Section 3 with various surfactant packages. All the oils listed as having been successfully emulsified to form stable emulsions can be emulsified with a surfactant package comprising 15 α emulsan technical grade , 42.5 Tergitol NP 40, and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A weight percent used at 1 part per 500 parts oil by weight. The method used for determining paraffin and aromatic content weight percent is described in Sections 7.2.11 and 7.2.12. Pre atomized fuels were formed in a blender at low speed in a manner preventing the beating of air into the emulsion with methanol incorporated into the aqueous phase. The hydrocarbon used was a mixture of Number 6 residual fuel oils, designated Amelia Fuel oil. The specific gravity of Amelia Fuel oil was 0.996 and its API gravity was 10.6 API. The viscosity versus temperature profile is shown in Table XX. The surfactant package comprised 15 α emulsan technical grade , 42.5 Tergitol NP 40 and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A w w . The surfactant package was added to aqueous phases containing various proportions of methanol and deionized water. The aqueous phases were blended at low speed for approximately 15 seconds to form pre atomized fuels wherein the ratio of Amelia Fuel to aqueous phase was 70 30 v v . Enough of the surfactant package was added to the aqueous phase such that the final proportion of surfactant package to Amelia Fuel in the pre atomized fuel was 1 250. Table XXI summarizes the variation of viscosity of the pre atomized fuel as the composition of the aqueous phase was varied. The results suggest that addition of methanol up to at least about 45 does not significantly affect viscosity reduction by the surfactant package. Experiments were performed with the Boscan crude oil described in Section 7.2.1, the Number 6 residual test fuel oil described in Section 7.2.3 and the Amelia Fuel oil described in Section 7.3.2 to determine the effect of variations in the proportion of the aqueous phase to oil phase on pre atomized fuel viscosity. The surfactant package used in all three sets of experiments comprised 15 α emulsan technical grade , 42.5 Tergitol NP 40 and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A w w . The viscosities reported in Tables XXII, XXIII and XXIV were measured on the Rheomat 30 as described in Section 7.2.11. Boscan crude oil was emulsified at low speed in a blender as in Section 7.3.1 in various proportions of water using a surfactant package ratio of 1 250 based on oil. Viscosities were measured at 37.7 C 100 F . The data are tabulated in Table XXII and presented graphically in FIG. 1. Similarly, Number 6 residual test fuel oil was emulsified in various proportions of deionized water using a surfactant package ratio of 1 250 based on oil. Viscosities were measured at 37.7 C 100 F . The data are tabulated in Table XXIII. Additionally, Amelia Fuel oil was emulsified in various proportions of an aqueous phase consisting of 13.3 w w methanol and 86.7 w w deionized water using a surfactant package ratio of 1 250 based on oil. Viscosities were measured at 37.7 C 100 F . The data are tabulated in Table XXIV. In all three cases, as the oil water ratio was increased, the viscosity similarly increased. Hydrocarbosols were prepared at low speed in a blender as in Section 7.3.1 with Boscan crude oil at oil water ratios of 72 28 and 63 37 v v using a surfactant package comprising 15 α emulsan technical grade , 42.5 Tergitol NP40 and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A, w w , at a ratio of 1 250 based on oil. The viscosity versus temperature profiles of emulsan stabilized Boscan crude oil hydrocarbosols were compared to the viscosity versus temperature profiles of the unemulsified crude oil. The temperature effects on hydrocarbosols were much less pronounced than on the crude oil from which the hydrocarbosols were formulated as depicted in FIG. 2. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the stability under static conditions of oil in water emulsions of viscous crude oils made with surfactant packages comprising chemical surfactants, with or without bioemulsifier. Specifically, the determination of the time course over which the oil in water emulsions maintained a reduced viscosity without breaking or inverting was desired to assess the ease and success with which such emulsions can be handled for transportation and or storage purposes. Behavior of viscous crude oil in water emulsions was of further interest with regard to the possiblity of pump failures and shut downs during pipelining operations where emulsion stability is desirable to avoid emulsion breakage and circumvent the need to re emulsify prior to re start of operations. Several surfactant packages, the compositions of which are shown in Table XXV, were used to prepare oil in water emulsions oil water 70 30 on a volume per volume v v basis in which the ratio of surfactant package to oil was 1 500 on a weight per weight w w basis. The surfactants used to formulate the surfactant packages of Table XXV are commercially available Tergitol NP 40 Union Carbide Corporation or Alfonic 1412 A Conoco, Inc. . The surfactant packages were formulated with or without α emulsan technical grade as indicated in the table directly below. The method used to prepare oil in water emulsions for these experiments was as follows. Into a suitable container, an amount of crude oil was weighed so as to make up 70 v v of the final emulsion. The crude oils used were the Boscan and Texas Fireflood crudes as described in Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, The results for Groups 1 7 see Table XXVI are tabulated in Tables XXVII XXXII, respectively. The results for Group 1 indicate that for emulsions .of the Texas fireflood crude in tap water, the addition of 15 w w α emulsan technical grade , to a surfactant package containing co surfactants Tergitol NP 40 and Alfonic 1412 A was preferable to the addition of 50 w w α emulsan and was also preferable to excluding α emulsan from the surfactant package. The results for Group 2 indicate that for emulsions of the Boscan crude in deionized water, the addition of 15 w w α emulsan to a surfactant package containing Tergitol NP 40 only did not improve viscosity reduction, although the measured viscosities of either emulsion, i.e., with or without α emulsan, were acceptably reduced. The results for Group 3 indicate that for emulsions of the Boscan crude in Texas brine, the addition of α emulsan to a surfactant package containing Tergitol NP 40 alone did not yield significantly different results from the surfactant package without α emulsan. Nevertheless, either surfactant package, i.e., with or without α emulsan yielded acceptably reduced viscosities. The results further demonstrated that brine can be used as aqueous phase. The results for Group 4 indicate that for emulsions of the Texas fireflood crude in deionized water, the addition of 15 w w α emulsan to a surfactant package containing Tergitol NP 40 only is preferable to omitting α emulsan from the surfactant package. The results of Group 5 indicate that for emulsions of the Texas fireflood crude in Texas brine, the addition of α emulsan to a surfactant package containing Tergitol NP 40 alone did not yield significantly different results from the surfactant package without α emulsan. Nevertheless, either surfactant package, i.e., with or without α emulsan yielded acceptably reduced viscosities. Comparison of the Group 4 data with that of Group 5 dramatically illustrates the effect of different aqueous phases on the viscosities of Texas fireflood crude oil in water emulsions. The data indicate that the use of Texas brine is preferable to the use of deionized water for forming oil in water emulsions with Texas fireflood crude. The results for Groups 6 and 7 indicate that for emulsions of the Kansas crude in tap water or Texas brine, the addition of 15 w w α emulsan to a surfactant package containing co surfactants Tergitol NP 40 and Alfonic 1412 A was preferable to the exclusion of α emulsan from the surfactant package. The data from these groups illustrate how the viscosity versus time profiles of emulsions of the same crude oil can vary dramatically as a function of the aqueous phase and also that the viscosity versus time behavior of one type of crude oil water emulsion can be signficantly different than that of other crude oil water emulsions. That the presence of α emulsan in surfactant packages used to emulsify Texas fireflood crude oil or Kansas crude oil has a significant effect on emulsion stability and maintenance of reduced viscosities can be seen in FIGS. 3, 4, 5 and 6 where the data from Groups 1, 4, 6 and 7 Tables XXVII, XXX, XXXII and XXXIII for 0 and 15 α emulsan are presented graphically. The lower curves in each figure represent the viscosity versus time profiles for α emulsan stabilized hydrocarbosols. The viscosities of the α emulsan stabilized hydrocarbosols remain significantly more reduced than that of the emulsions formed with surfactant packages that did not include α emulsan. An experiment was performed to compare the emulsion stabilizing effect of α emulsan with that of known chemical emulsion stabilizers, naphthalene sulfonate and lignin sulfonate. Specifically, the viscosity versus time profiles at 23.8 C 75 F were followed for four emulsions containing either α emulsan, naphthalene sulfonate or lignin sulfonate or no stabilizer at all. All emulsions were formulated with the Texas fireflood crude described in Section 7.2.2. at an oil water ratio of 70 30 v v . Surfactant packages were used at a ratio of 1 500 w w based on oil. The results are shown in FIG. 7. The α emulsan stabilized hydrocarbosol was formulated with a surfactant package comprising 15 α emulsan technical grade , 42.5 Tergitol NP 40, and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A w w its viscosity versus time profile is the curve depicted by closed circles. The naphthalene sulfonate stabilized emulsion was formulated with a surfactant package comprising 15 naphthalene sulfonate, 42.5 Tergitol NP 40 and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A w w its viscosity versus time profile is the curve depicted by closed triangles. The lignin sulfonate stabilized emulsion was formulated with a surfactant package comprising 15 lignin sulfonate 42.5 Tergitol NP 40 and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A w w its viscosity versus time profile is the curve depicted by closed inverted closed triangles. A fourth emulsion the control was formulated with a surfactant package comprising 50 Tergitol NP 40 and 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A w w with no additional emulsion stabilizer its viscosity versus time profile is the curve depicted by open squares. Immediately after emulsion formation a zero time point measurement was taken. Thereafter the emulsions were allowed to remain stationary for 28 days during which time period viscosities of the four emulsions were measured daily to determine the increase, if any, in viscosity. The points in FIG. 7 represented by stars indicate that by day 8 for the naphthalene sulfonate stabilized emulsion and by day 12 for the lignin sulfonate stabilized emulsion, these two emulsions had failed, i.e., inverted into water in oil emulsions. It can be seen from FIG. 7 that under the conditions of the experiment, α emulsan was a significantly more effective stabilizer of Texas fireflood crude oil water emulsions than were either of the two chemical stabilizers lignin sulfonate and naphthalene sulfonate or the co surfactants Tergitol NP 40 and Alfonic 1412 A alone. α Emulsan preparations in the form of purified grade, technical grade, whole broth, supernatant, and α Emulsans produced by Preparations of materials produced by NS strains of In addition to the bioemulsifiers, there are conventional synthetic surfactants which are also known emulsion stabilizers lignin sulfonates and naphthalene sulfonates are examples of such materials. Replacement of α emulsan with these surfactants also allows production of oil in water emulsions. However, the lignin sulfonates do not produce emulsions of reduced viscosity, whereas the naphthalene sulfonates are generally satisfactory replacements for α emulsan for use with viscous residuals. These naphthalene sulfonates not only produce very fluid emulsions, they also minimize, if not entirely prevent, creaming of the oil. These particular anionic surfactants perform well with all of the co surfactants mentioned earlier, and will successfully produce emulsions. The composition of a surfactant package that was successfully used both to form a stable pre atomized fuel from a California vacuum resid and to form a stable slurry from a ROSE resid is listed in Table XVIII, Package 17. The α emulsan used was prepared from a technical grade of emulsan as described in Section 7.1.1. The surfactants Lignosol BD Reed Ltd. Chemical Div. , Triton X series Rohm Haas Co. , and Tergitol NP series Union Carbide Corp. are commercially available. Both the pre atomized fuels and slurries were formed in an Osterizer Galaxy 14 blender at high speed in a manner which prevents the incorporation of air into the resulting dispersion. The ratio of California resid and ROSE resid to their respective aqueous phases was 70 30 by weight w w . The surfactant package was used at a ratio of 1 100 surfactant hydrocarbon by weight w w for both the pre atomized fuel and the slurry. The surfactant package comprising 42.8 Triton X 405, 28.6 Tergitol NP 40, 14.2 Lignosol BD, and 14.2 technical grade α emulsan was the preferred surfactant package for use with both California vacuum resid and ROSE resid. Results of mixing the slurry with the pre atomized fuel are listed in Table XXXIV. The composition of a surfactant package that was successfully used to form a stable pre atomized fuel at a high temperature and under pressure was as folows 88.5 w w Nacconal 90 F Stepan Chemical Co. , a linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate and 11.5 α emulsan whole broth. The α emulsan used was prepared from a post fermentation whole broth as described in Section 7.1.2. The ratio of the hydrocarbon phase to the aqueous phase was 70 30 California vacuum resid tap water by weight. The surfactant was used at a ratio of 1 200 surfactant hydrocarbon by weight. The pre atomized fuel was formed as described in Section 6.3. with the folowing modification the pre atomized fuel was formed at 148.8 C 300 F and approximately 4.82 10⁵ Pa 70 psi pressure was maintained in order to prevent the vaporization of the aqueous phase. The pre atomized fuel was then cooled to a temperature lower than 100 C 212 F using an appropriate heat exhange device and pressure was released. The foregoing experiment was performed with a surfactant package containing only Nacconal 90 F with similar results. The composition of a surfactant package that was successfully used to form a stable pre atomized fuel from a German Visbreaker resid was as folows 50 Triton X 705 w w Rohm Haas Co. , 33.3 Tergitol NP 70 Union Carbide Corp. and 16.7 whole broth α emulsan. The α emulsan used was prepared from a post fermentation whole broth according to the methods described in Section 7.1.2. The pre atomized fuel was formed in an Osterizer Galaxy 14 blender at the highest speed setting in a manner which prevents the incorporation of air into the resulting dispersion. The ratio of the hydrocarbon phase to the aqueous phase was 69.2 30.8 by weight w w . The surfactant package was used at a ratio of 1 350 surfactant hydrocarbon by weight w w . The method used to form the pre atomized fuel is described in Section 6.3 with the following modifications The water used to form the pre atomized fuel was divided into two parts 37.5 by weight of the water was placed in a container and partially frozen to make a slush and 62.5 by weight of the water was combined with the surfactant package and used to form a pre atomized fuel as described in Section 6.3. The ratio of the hydrocarbon phase to the aqueous phase at this point was 78.3 by weight German visbreaker resid and 21.7 by weight water surfactant package. The newly formed hot pre atomized fuel was then combined with the remaining water which had been frozen and the total mixture was immediately placed in an ice bath. This caused an immediate and rapid quenching of the pre atomized fuel to a temperature at least about 37.7 C 100 F below the softening point of the hydrocarbon. The pre atomized fuel produced utilizing this method has been observed to be stable and maintain a reduced viscosity for several weeks. A pilot scale field test was conducted to determine how a hydrocarbosol would perform under simulated pipelining conditions. Approximately 29 barrels BBL of the Boscan crude oil described in Section 7.2.1. were emulsified into approximately 12 barrels of aqueous phase to form an oil in water emulsion. The final oil phase to aqueous phase ratio was 70 30 v v . The aqueous phase consisted of tapwater supplied by the Tulsa, Oklahoma municipal system total dissolved solids 221 ppm total hardness 151 ppm . Emulsification was accomplished by mixing warm oil with surfactant containing aqueous phase using a centrifugal pump. The surfactant package used comprised α emulsan technical grade and Tergitol NP 40 at 15 and 85 by weight, respectively. The surfactant package was used at a treatment rate of 1 part surfactant package to 500 parts oil by weight. The resulting hydrocarbosol was continuously circulated in a pipe loop at an average velocity of 2.04 m s 6.7 ft sec 7.93 cm 3.125 inch I.D., 0.780 m 2,560 feet long for 96 hours using a centrifugal pump. This is shown schematically in FIG. 8. During the entire test run the observed hydrocarbosol viscosity remained less than 0.1 Pa.s 100cp . Pressure drop flow rate data indicated an apparent viscosity of approximately 0.070 Pa.s 70cp at 15 C 60 F for the hydrocarbosol throughout the operation. This is in dramatic contrast to the viscosity of the Boscan crude before emulsification, approximately 192 Pa.s 192.000 cp . At the end of the continuous test period, flow through the loop was interrupted for 64 hours to simulate a pump failure. After three days of shutdown, pumping was resumed with no apparent change in hydrocarbosol characteristics. Pressure drops and flow rates were similar after restart as prior to shutdown. There was no need to reemulsify. During this test, the hydrocarbosol was pumped an actual physical distance of approximately 612 km 380 miles . It traversed the pump once every 17 minutes. In this manner, the hydrocarbosol was subjected to stress shear roughly equivalent to being pumped a distance of 41820 km 26,000 miles in a commercial pipeline considering pipe diameters, pump transits, flow rates, etc. . Such stress is known to cause failure inversion of oil in water emulsions stabilized by conventional surfactants. Laboratory evaluation of the hydrocarbosol upon completion of the test demonstrated that, should demulsification be desirable, the emulsion could be demulsified readily using standard oilfield techniques. Table XXXV summarizes the pertinent numbers, results, and conditions of the pipelining pilot test. The direct combustion test was run in a large scale 1 Megawatt furnace assembly, essentially comprising in sequential arrangement a burner, a brick lined experimental chamber also called the refractory lined combustion tunnel , an after burner, a water cooled cold wall chamber and an exhaust section, approximately 1.14 meters m , 4.55 m, 1.24 m, 4.55 m and 1.65 m in length, respectively. The other major components of the facility used include the systems for storage, metering, feeding and control of fuels, for pumping, preheating, and metering of the combustion air, and for cleaning and pumping the combustion products. The furnace assembly is equipped with water cooled probes for sampling combustion gases which are drawn off under vacuum and pass through a sample transport line to a set of continuous on line gas analyzers, specifically a Chemiluminescent NO NOX Gas Analyzer Thermo Electron Corporation, Model 10A , an Infrared CO Analyzer Beckman, Inc., Model 865 , an Infrared CO₂ Analyzer Beckman, Inc., Model 865 and a Paramagnetic O₂ Analyzer Beckman, Inc., Model 755 . The furnace assembly is also equipped with a water cooled suction pyrometer for measuring axial flame temperatures at various flame positions within the experimental combustion tunnel. The furnace assembly is further equipped with water cooled water quench sampling probes through which combustion gases, including particulates, are drawn off under vacuum, are quenched with water and flow through a sampling train, the first component of which is a filter paper for collection of solids. This equipment provides for the quantitation of solids in the combustion gases. The characteristics of the Number 6 residual test fuel oil used as the oil phase of the pre atomized fuel are described in Section 7.2.3. Table XXXVI summarizes the ultimate analysis of the fuel oil. Its heating value was 10 213 KCal kg 18,384 Btu lb . The Number 6 fuel oil was emulsified in water using a surfactant package comprising 15 α emulsan technical grade , 42.5 Tergitol NP 40, 42.5 Alfonic 1412 A in weight percent . The surfactant package was used at a rate of 1 part per 250 parts oil w w . The ratio of oil to water in the resulting pre atomized fuel was approximately 70 30 v v . One hundred ten gallons of pre atomized fuel were prepared in a fuel preparation system which incorporates a Gaulin mechanical homogenizer. The aqueous solution containing the surfactant package was fed via a centrifugal pump into a mixing T located in the Number 6 fuel oil supply line. This arrangement provided in line pre mixing of the oil and water prior to entering a 45 g.p.h. high pressure mechanical homogenizer Gaulin . The minimum homogenization pressure of 6,89 10⁵ Pa 1000 psi was employed for producing the pre atomized fuel. The resulting pre atomized fuel had a viscosity ranging from 70 120 10 ³Pa.s at 26.6 C 80 F . Accurate control of both oil and water flow rates are required to maintain a constant 70 30 oil water mass ratio during this continuous mixing process. Precise control of the water flow proved to be a problem due to the very low flow rates required, and it is estimated that the oil water ratio varied between 65 35 and 75 25 during production. Two barrels of pre atomized fuel were produced with the following composition Barrel 1 71.25 28.75 water by weight and Barrel 2 69.78 oil 30.22 water by weight. Both barrels of pre atomized fuel were produced one week prior to the combustion test and no separation was apparent during this time. Prior to the combustion test both barrels were stirred with a slow speed stirrer. Standard procedures for firing a Number 6 fuel oil in the type of furnace assembly employed were followed with the exception that the in line fuel heaters were not used, and the pre atomized fuel was fired at a temperature of approximately 32.2 C 90 F . The refractory lined combustion tunnel was brought up to operating temperature approximately 1000 C using natural gas. The gas gun was then removed and replaced by a standard oil gun fitted with a twin fluid atomizer of the Y jet type. Compressed air at approximately 0.41 10⁵ Pa 60 psi was used for the atomizing fluid. The initial light off on the oil burner was accomplished using a Number 2 oil as is standard practice. The air and fuel flow rates were then adjusted to give a thermal input of approximately 1 MW or 3.4 MM Btu hr. A simple on load fuel transfer from Number 2 fuel oil to the 70 30 pre atomized fuel was then effected by transferring the suction hose from the barrel of Number 2 fuel to the barrel of pre atomized fuel. A significant reduction in fuel flow rate occurred shortly after transfer to the pre atomized fuel due primarily to the higher viscosity of the pre atomized fuel and the resultant pressure drop in the fuel lines. Stable flame conditions were maintained during the fuel transfer but good flame conditions could not be achieved as the fuel flow rate fell below the minimum required. Initially the drop in fuel flow rate was thought to be due to blockage of the atomizer. The Y jet atomizer was removed, cleaned, and replaced. Light off was accomplished without any problem using the pre atomized fuel but low fuel flow rates prevailed. A second atomizer, of the internal mix type was then employed. Again light off using the pre atomized fuel presented no problem but the low fuel flow rate persisted. Finally it was concluded that the flow problem was due to a partially blocked flow control valve. The nature of this blockage was not determined. A manual by pass valve around the control valve was opened and the pre atomized fuel flow rate was increased to a maximum of approximately 1.8 kg 4 lb min approximately 0.9 MW input . This resulted in an entirely satisfactory flame having visible characteristics very similar to those of a Number 6 fuel oil flame obtained under similar firing conditions. A stable flame was maintained throughout the remainder of the test period, during which time minimum excess air levels, solids emissions, and axial flame temperatures were measured. The ignitability and stability of the 70 30 pre atomized fuel were found to be comparable with those of a Number 6 fuel oil when fired under similar conditions in the furnace assembly used. Flame stability was found to be acceptable even when the important combustion parameters of excess air, minimum fuel flow rate, and atomization conditions were not matched. This occurred inadvertently during light off and when fuel flow rates fell below the limits for acceptable flame conditions. However, these results indicated that ignition and flame stability were not major problems of the pre atomized fuel. Minimum excess air levels of less than 2 were achieved without any visible smoke or carbon monoxide in the flue gas. These figures compare favorably with those attainable with a Number 6 fuel oil. Table XXXVII summarizes the range of operating conditions examined during this short test in terms of excess air levels and flue gas composition, the major point of interest being the low excess air levels that were obtained. The visible flame length under these conditions was approximately 6 ft. and the general appearance of the flame was very similar to that of a Number 6 fuel oil flame. The exhaust gas on exit from the high temperature combustion zone appeared to contain a small amount of white smoke , very similar in appearance to that observed when firing coal water slurries under similar conditions. This white smoke was not visible on exit from the stack and its nature was not determined. A water cooled probe was used to obtain solids samples from the exhaust gas and along the axis of the flame. FIG. 9 shows the concentration profiles along the flame axis for a Number 6 fuel oil and the 70 30 pre atomized fuel. The solids concentration at the exit from the combustor was almost identical for these two fuels. The solids concentration within the flame was slightly lower for the 70 30 pre atomized fuel. These two flames were obtained using two different atomizers nevertheless the data indicate that the carbon burnout achieved with the pre atomized fuel fired at 32.2 C 90 F was comparable to that for the parent Number 6 fuel fired at 115,5 C 240 F to facilitate atomization. Axial flame temperatures were also measured using a water cooled suction pyrometer and these are shown in FIG. 10. The 70 30 pre atomized fuel flame exhibited a slightly lower temperature along the entire length of the combustion chamber. This was entirely compatible with the quenching effect expected from the 30 water content. The measured reduction in flame temperature of 100 150 C does not represent a serious problem in most industrial combustion systems. Subsequent to the above combustion test, another series of test burns were made using the oils and pre atomized fuels of these oils, as listed in Table XXXVII. Procedures followed to form the pre atomized fuels are described,
