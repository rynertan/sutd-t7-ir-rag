# Lamp monitoring circuit.

## Abstract
In order to provide a lamp failure warning in both illumi nated and unilluminated states of the lamp, there is provided a resistance bridge circuit Rs, L, R2 and R3 which is sustan tially in balance if the lamp L is sound. An amplifier IC1 acts as a detection means if the bridge goes out of balance as a consequence of failure of the lamp L. In the unilluminated state a reduced current is fed to the bridge via a high value resistance R1, which is by passed by a lamp switch SW1 if the lamp is to receive enough power to illuminate it.
