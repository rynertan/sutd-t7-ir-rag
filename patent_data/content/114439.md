# Monomode optical transmission fibre having a tapered end portion and method of manufacturing such a fibre.

## Abstract
A monomode optical tansmission fibre with a tapered end portion is described. By arranging a lens on this end portion, which lens has a refractive index which is higher than that of the fibre core, a substantially better coupling efficiency is obtained. The lens can be formed by immersing the tapered end portion in a liquid transparent material and allowing the drop formed on the end portion after withdraw al to solidify.
