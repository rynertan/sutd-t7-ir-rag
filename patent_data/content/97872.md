# Steam cooled hanger tube for horizontal superheaters and reheaters.

## Abstract
In combination, a vertical gas pass 12 through which hot gases flow, a heat exchanger including a first tube panel 24, 26 having serpentine tube means, each tube means having a plurality of first 24, 26 horizontal tube portions, said heat exchanger having a second tube panel 32, 34 having serpentine tube means, each tube means having a plurality of second 32, 34 horizontal tube portions which lie adjacent to and in the same horizontal planes as the first 24, 26 horizontal tube portions, the upper terminal ends of the serpentine tube means having first vertical runs 24, 26 extending downwardly to a point beneath the bottom of the serpentine tube means, and having U bends 28, 30 at the bottom, and having second vertical runs, which bend at the top and are integral with the uppermost horizontal tube portions, lug means 40 attached to opposite sides of some of the vertical runs 24, 26 , a plurality of band means 42 encircling adjacent first and second horizontal tube portions 24, 32 , the ends of band means being attached 44, 46 to the lug means 40 , each band means 42 being loose enough to permit relative movement between the two adjacent horizontal tube portions 24, 32 , and also permit relative movement between the vertical run 26 and each of the horizontal tube portions 24, 32 .
