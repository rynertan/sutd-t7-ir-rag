# High voltage thyristor converter.

## Abstract
A high voltage thyristor converter comprising a plurality of thyristor modules, a transducer for feeding a control signal to each of the thyristor modules in response to an external operation command, and means for transferring the output control signal of the transducer to each thyristor module. The transfer means includes a laser beam irradiator for converting the control signal into a laser beam signal, and a light sensitive element for converting the laser beam signal into an electric control signal.
