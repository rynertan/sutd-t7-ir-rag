# Address translation memory.

## Abstract
A new and improved content addressable memory cell is disclosed, which cell stores data supplied on a load data input terminal thereof. The disclosed memory cell is adapted for comparing data supplied on a compare data input terminal thereof with data stored in the cell, and for supplying an output signal on a match data output terminal when the compare data is the same as the data stored in the cell. A latch circuit is employed as the storage element of the cell. First and second means are each coupled between a reference potential and the match data output terminal, which means are operative in response to the state of the latch circuit and the compare data supplied on the compare data input terminal.
