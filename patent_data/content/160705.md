# MACHINING METHOD FOR MACHINE TOOLS.

## Abstract
Method of machining by a reciprocating cutting motion and, more particularly, to a machining method including the steps of automatically preparing a pickfeed path along which a tool TL does not interfere with a workpiece WK at the time of pickfeed moving the tool along the pickfeed path and effecting cutting. In the case of a workpiece which has a concave portion in the vicinity of the pickfeed path, first, an approach plane AP is obtained which is parallel to a plane PL that comes in contact with an outline curve OLC of the workpiece at a subsequent machining start point Ps and which includes a machining end point Pe, and then, a crossing point Pc is obtained which is defined between the approach plane AP and a straight line SL which passes through the machining start point Ps and extends in the direction of the central axis of the tool at the machining start point, whereby the pickfeed path is determined by the path Pe Pc Ps. On the other hand, in the case of a workpiece which has a convex portion in the vicinity of the pickfeed path, first, an approach plane AP is obtained which comes in contact with an outline curve OLC of the workpiece at a subsequent machining start points Ps, and then, a crossing point Pc is obtained which is defined between the approach plane and a straight line SL which passes through the machining end point Pe and extends in the direction of the central axis of the tool at the machining end point, whereby the pickfeed path is determined by the path Pe Pc Ps.
