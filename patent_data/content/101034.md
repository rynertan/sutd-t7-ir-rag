# Method for preparing 3 amino 5 substituted isoxazole.

## Abstract
In accordance with this invention, 3 amino 5 substituted isoxazole is prepared by reacting, in aqueous medium, an appropriately substituted acetonitriie with hyd roxylamine under mildly basic conditions and a moderately elevated temperature. The reaction mixture is extracted with a water immiscible organic solvent or mixture of organic solvents, the aqueous phase is adjusted to a moderately acidic pH and heated at a moderate temperature. The aqueous reaction mixture is then cooled, adjusted to a moderately basic pH and precipitated 3 amino 5 substituted isoxazole is isolated therefrom.
