# Aqueous aminomethylenephosphonic acid solutions containing organic carboxylate stabilizing agent.

## Abstract
Aqueous solutions of aminomethylenephosphonic acid, chiefly diethylenetriaminepenta methylenephosphonic acid , are disclosed containing a crystallization inhibitor which is an alkali metal salt of an organic carboxylic acid and residual hydrochloric acid originating from the manufacturing process. The equivalent molar concentration ratio of carboxylic acid salt to hydrochloric acid is greater than 1, preferably from 1.5 to 3.
