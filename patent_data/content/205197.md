# Conveyor with a curved disc.

## Abstract
An arrangement on conveyors of the type which compris es a flexible chain 1 whereupon objects, e.g. parallel epipedic packing containers 9 , are conveyed. The conveyor comprises guide rails 4 located on either side of the chain 1 which steer the packing container 9 . In curves the guide rails 4 are substitued on the one side by a curve disc 5 having a sloping steering surface 8 which acts upon the packing con tainer 9 outwards against the guide rails 4 located on the opposite side of the conveyor. As a result packing containers 9 of different size can be conveyed on the conveyor without adjustment.
