# Method of processing nitrile polymers.

## Abstract
A method for improving the colour and impact strength of a nitrile polymer, in particular an acrylonitrile or meth acrylonitrile polymer, produced by the polymerisation of an olefinically unsaturated nitrile and a preformed rubber component, said polymer having at least 50 weight per cent of the nitrile, characterised in that the polymer is heated to a plastic state in the absence of oxygen and in the pre sence of an inert gas.
