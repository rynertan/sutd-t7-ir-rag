# Toothed belt.

## Abstract
A toothed belt 10 having a fabric 13 adhered to the toothed portion of the belt formed of synthetic resin yarns having an ultimate viscosity of greater than approximately 1.30. In the illustrated embodiment, the yarns extending in the longitudinal direction of the belt are fully processed yarns. The cloth is preferably a woven cloth wherein one or the other of the weft 15 and warp 16 are woolly processed. The use of the disclosed cloth provides a substantial improvement in resistance of the belt to cracking and shearing of the teeth in use.
