When the user closes the console cover, the console cover switch is turned off. As a result, a message Your REC schedule is reserved at 6 00 for 2 HRS on 6th channel. appears on the lower portion 4 of the CRT display panel 2. Thus the schedule data is stored in a random access memory RAM . The timetable and the scheduled contents disappear in a few seconds. Thus the user can visually check the REC schedule. In the above operation, if the cassette is not inserted when the user presses the event SW 1, a message You can reserve another REC schedule. appears at the lower portion 4 of the CRT display panel 2. If the user wishes to reserve another REC schedule, he uses the dial 1, the dial 2, the dial 3 and an event SW 2 of the event switches 9a. In this embodiment, four event switches 9a are provided, so that the user can reserve a maximum of four REC schedules. The TV VTR apparatus shown in Figure 1 has a microprocessor for executing processing as shown in Figures 3 to 5. The microprocessor executes the flows shown in Figures 3 to 5 upon operation of the control panel 7. In particular, the user can perform timer programing while observing the messages appearing on the CRT display panel 2. In this manner, the user can follow the instructions appearing on the CRT display panel. When timer programing is completed, the program contents and ON times are displayed on the CRT display panel 2. The machine microcomputer signals the completion of timer programing to a user operator . In other words, the user can perform timer programing in a conventional manner. If the user operates erroneously despite the messages given by the microcomputer, the microcomputer signals such an erroneous operation to the user. The user can then operate correctly. Timer programing can be repeated by the number of times corresponding to the number of event switches 9a four in this embodiment .The weekly timetable Figure 2 is displayed on the CRT display panel 2, so that the user can reserve TV programs over the following several days. The cursor 3a is moved in accordance with the messages of the flow chart in Figure 5, and the programing contents such as day, AM PM, ON time, REC duration, and channel number can be displayed in the analog form as shown in Figure 2. When the user presses event SW l first time of the event switches 9a, the designated time range is highlighted in green. The user can check timer programing as if the schedule were written in a pocketbook. In particular, mis programing which reserves conflicting time ranges can be prevented.Since the preset time can be digitally displayed at the digital display unit 16, the start point ON time and the end point OFF time of each bar in the timetable 3 displayed on the CRT display panel 2 need not be accurately read since the time schedule can also be preset at the digital display unit 16. When timer programing is completed, programed data can be read out as needed using a paging function, so that the timetable and the reserved time ranges bars can be displayed A data processing section of the TV VTR apparatus having the timer programing function shown in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 6. The data processing section has a microprocessor which comprises a control processing unit CPU 18, a read only memory ROM 19 and a RAM 20. The programs which perform the data processing steps as described above are stored in the ROM 19 and the RAM 20. The TV channel buttons 5, the event switches 9a, the TV button 10, the VTR button 11, the power switch 2, the function buttons 13a to 13d, the time set dial 1, the time set dial 2, the time set dial 3, and the VTR operation buttons 14 shown inFigures 1 and 2 are coupled to the CPU 18 and the RAM 20 through an interface circuit 21, a buffer 22 and a data bus 23. Address signals for accessing the buttons and switches are generated from the CPU 18 and are supplied to the interface 21 through an address bus 24 and an address decoder 25.The operation data of the TV, the VTR and the timer are fetched in the CPU 18 and are stored in the RAM 20. The ONIOFF operation of the TV channel lamps and other monitor lamps is controlled by the address data which is supplied from the CPU 18 to an interface 26 through the address bus 24 and the address decoder 25. The messages, timetable 3 and the cursor 3a are displayed in accordance with the contents stored in a character RAM 27 and a graphicRAM 28 each of which has a memory area corresponding to the TV display panel. The input data associated with timer programing are supplied from the interface 21 to the CPU 18 and the RAM 20. The input data are then processed under the control of the CPU 18 and are stored such that the character data is stored in a character RAM 27 and the graphic data is stored in a graphic RAM 28. The write address data is supplied from theCPU 18 to the RAMs 27 and 28 through the address bus 24 and a selector 29.However, when the input data are not supplied to the RAMs, address data are supplied from a CRT controller 30 to the RAMs 27 and 28 through the selector 29, so that the contents are continuously read out from the RAMs 27 and 28 to display the stored contents on the CRT display panel 2. ASCII coded data read out from the character RAM 27 is supplied to a character ROM 31 and is converted to a character dot pattern. The outputs from the character ROM 31 and the graphic RAM 28 are mixed by an OR gate 32. An 8 bit parallel signal is then supplied from the OR gate 32 to a parallel serial P S converter 33. The P S converter 33 receives the parallel data supplied thereto in response to a clock pulse which has a predetermined period and which is generated from a clock generator 34.The P S converter 33 then converts the parallel data to a serial video signal.The serial video signal is then supplied from the P S converter 33 to a monitor TV through a mixer changeover circuit MIX CHGOV 35. As a result, the display state shown in Figure 2 is obtained. On the other hand, a TV tuner 37 is set in response to the operation data supplied from one of the TV channel buttons 5 through the data bus 23.The output video signal is supplied from the TV tuner 37 to the mixer changeover circuit 35 through a demodulator 38. The video output from the demodulator 38 is supplied to a VTR 39. The VTR 39 is connected to the data bus 23 and is controlled in accordance with the operation of theVTR operation buttons 14 and the timer output data read out from the CPU 18 and the RAM 20. A reproduction output from the VTR 39 is supplied to the monitor TV through the mixer changeover circuit 35. Outputs from the REC safety tab sensor, a cassette IN sensor, a dew sensor and a tape end sensor are supplied to the data bus 23 through an interface 40. At the same time, an interrupt request signal is supplied from an interrupt controller 41 to the CPU 18, so that the individual outputs from the sensors can be processed as needed. The time signal as the reference of timer counting is generated by a clock IC 42 and is supplied onto the data bus 23. The clock set inputs from the time set keys are supplied to the clock IC 42 through the interface 40. In the embodiment of Figure 1, in order to perform timer programing at the timetable 3 displayed on the CRT display panel 2, dials rotary knobs are used to move the cursors 3a vertically and horizontally. However, the cursor shift mechanism is not limited to this arrangement, but extended to push buttons key switches , a joystick, or a write pen. The timer preset apparatus described can be built into a VTR. Alternatively, the timer preset apparatus can be manufactured as an independent unit. In these cases, the timetable 3 and the bar graph indicating the reserved time ranges Figure 2 can be displayed on a TV receiver connected to the VTR or timer. Thus in the embodiment, the cursors displayed in the timetable on theCRT display panel can be moved by the time set means of the TV program timer apparatus so as to perform timer programing. Furthermore, the reserved time ranges can be displayed in the form of the bar graph in the timetable, so that the user can visually check the programing state. In addition to these advantages, the operation can be simplified, thereby reducing mis operation. Moreover, since the user just follows the messages displayed on the CRT display panel, mis operation is further decreased. The reserved contents are displayed in the form of the bar graph, and timer programing can be simplified. At the same time, the reserved contents are numerically displayed, so that the bar graph display is combined with the numeric display to provide better read ability. As a result, the user can readily confirm timer programing, preventing erroneous setting operations.
