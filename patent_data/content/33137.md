# Semiconductor laser device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser device comprises a semiconduc tor assembly which serves to effect laser oscillation and in which first, second and third semiconductor layers 2,3, 4 are successively stacked on a predetermined semiconductor body 1 , at least the first and third semiconductor layers 2,4 having a smaller refractive index and a greater forbidden band gap relative than the second semiconductor layer 3 and having conductivity types opposite to each other, and means 6, 8 to spread depletion regions within at least a part of a current path for effecting the laser oscillation and in a manner to intersect with the current path. A small sized semi conductor laser device capable of fast modulation can be realized.
