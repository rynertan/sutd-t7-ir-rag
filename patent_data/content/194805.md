# Test clip for PLCC.

## Abstract
A test clip for a plastic leaded chip carrier PLCC includes a plurality of electrical contacts 20 for electrically connecting with respective leads of the PLCC 12 , an electrically non conductive body 21 for supporting such contacts in spaced apart positions, and a retaining mechan ism 22 for holding the test clip in operative position with respect to the PLCC. The retaining mechanism includes plural latching arms 100 at respective corners of the test clip and a slide actuator 80 therefor. The slide actuator also is operative to deflect the contacts from a normally open position to a closed position engaging respective leads of the PLCC.
