# Mass spectrometer and method for the elemental analysis of solids.

## Abstract
Material is removed from a solid surface and ionized to produce singly charged monatomic ions representative of the surface. In the ion source 10 a sample 50 of the material or surface is mounted opposite the exit slit 12 51 biased negatively with respect to the source s block and sputtered with argon ions. Some of the sputtered sample material is ionized by charge exchange with the argon ions near the ion source s exit slit 12 51 and accelerated into a mass analyzer 16 . An electron beam 73 is used to ionize the argon sputtering gas.
