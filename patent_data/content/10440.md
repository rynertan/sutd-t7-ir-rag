In accordance with the present invention, the novel compounds are prepared by processes outlined in the following reaction scheme. EMI5.1 In the foregoing reaction scheme X, Y, R1 andR2 are as defined above. The preparation of the compound of this invention begins with pvromellitic dianhydride II which is treated with a substituted amine represented bv R1NX2 however, the order of reaction is not dependent upon which amine is employed and either the R1 or R2 amine could be reacted first. The reaction is carried out in an aprotic solvent such as acetone, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, dimethyl acetamide, diphenyl ether, dioxane, and the like, and is complete in about 5 minutes to 2 hours.A single molar equivalent of the amine is employed. The reaction is preferably maintained in an anhydrous state and anhydrous amines are preferably employed, since water will react with the anhydride at longer reaction times greater than 2 hours . The pyromellitic acid anhydride monoamlde III is then heated to form the pyromellitic imide anhydride IV . The heating may take place in refluxlng thionyl chloride and is complete in about 1 10 hours. No solvent is employed for heating in thionyl chloride. Alternatively the reaction may be heated in a high boiling solvent such as dimethylformamide dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, dipenyl ether and the like at from about 1000C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The reaction is complete in about 1 2 to 1 hour. The reaction products IV are isolated following procedures known to those skilled in this art. The pyromellitic imide anhydride IV is then treated with an amine represented by R2NH2 in order to form the pyromellitic acid amide imide V .The reaction is carried out very much in the manner of the first amine reaction II to IV , however, since there is only a single anhydride function to be reacted, it is possible to use more than a single mole of the amine from 1 to 2 molar equivalents are preferred and to increase the reaction times, the reaction is generally complete in about 10 minutes to 4 hours at from OOC to room temperature. Compound V is then heated either in thionyl chloride or dimethylformamide as described above in order to form the pyromellitic diimide compounds of this invention I . Alternatively the pyromellitic imide anhydride IV may be reacted without isolating the intermediate V . The initial reaction with one mole of the amine may be carried out in a high boiling solvent such as dimethylformamide, but at the temperature conditions above described. Then, after the prescribed reaction times the reaction mixture may be slowly brought over a period of from 1 to 4 hours to the reaction conditions of the second step. The product I will be isolated in the usual manner. An alternative procedure outlined in the above reaction sequence reacts compound III with a second mole of amine in order to form theR1, R2 disubstituted pyromellitic diamide VI .The positioning of the bonds in structure VI indicates that a mixture of compounds is formed, viz the compound with R1 on the upper carbonyl and the compound with R1 on the lower carbonyl of the left side of the molecule. The mixture is not isolatec, since both compounds of the mixture will form the same compound after the cyclization. The reaction is carried out using the same conditions used to form compound V from compound TV . Compound VI is then cyclized to the compounds of this invention I following the same procedure used to prepare compound T. from compound V , that is heating in thionyl chloride or dimethylformamide. The products are isolated using known techniques. An alternative procedure, useful when one of R1 or R2 is hydrogen is outlined in the following reaction scheme EMI8.1 In the foregoing reaction scheme pyromellitic dianhydride II is treated with ammonia to prepare the 2,4, 5 tricarboxybenzene 1 carbamate VII . The reaction is generally carried out in a non polar solvent in which the starting material is soluble such as tetrahydrofuran, acetone, and the lite and is complete in from 5 minutes to 2 hours at from OOC to room temperature.Room temperature is preferred. Compound VII is then heated with thionyl chloride at about room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture for from 1 2 to 6 hours to prepare the pyromellitic imide anhydride VIII . Generally the reaction is carried out without any solvent using an excess of thionyl chloride, however, if desired, a non polar solvent, such as benzene or toluene may be employed. Alternatively the heating may be carried out in a high boiling solvent as described above to form compound VIII . Compound VIII is then treated with an R1 substituted amine to react with the anhydride portion of compound VIII and prepare the R1 carbamoyl compound IX . The reaction is generally carried out in a solvent as described above and is complete in about 5 minutes to 2 hours at from about 10 to 500C. Room temperature is preferred. The carbamoyl compound IX is heated.in a high boiling solvent as described above to prepare the R1 monosubstituted pyromellitic diimide X . The products are isolated using techniques known to those skilled in this art. Alternatively, the pyromellitic imide anhydride VIII may be reacted without isolating the intermediate IX as described for the reaction of IV to I. Many of the compounds of this invention are conveniently prepared by reacting a substituent on the pyromellitic diimide moiety to prepare a different substituent. Such compounds are often also prepares by the above procedure, however, occasionally it is more convenient to delay the subsequent reaction until after the pyromellitic diimide compound is formed, in order to minimize side reactions, to facilitate the work up procedures, and the like. An example of such would be the reactions carried out on the N,N hydroxyalkyl or aminoalkyl pyromellitic diimides. For the reactions preparing derivatives thereof, such as acyl derivatives, it is more convenient to acylate the N,N hydroxyalkyl or aminoa kyl compound than to use the acylated amino compound as starting material. While it is possible to carry out the reaction either way, the later acylation avoids the possibility that the acyl group will be removed by hydrolysis during the course of the reaction. Such an acylation of the hydroxyalkyl, or aminoalkyl substituted pyromellitic diimide is carried out using standard acylation reagents such as the anhydride or halide of the acyl moiety. With lower molecular weight reagents such as acetic and propionic anhydride, the reagent is used as a solvent. For higher molecular weight reagents, where excess reagent would be more difficult difficult to remove, an equivalent amount or a slight excess is employed and a basic inert solvent such as pyridine is employed. The reaction is carried out at from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, preferably at from 75 1000C, for from 5 minutes to 5 hours. The product is isolated using techniques known to those skilled in this art. The compounds of the instant invention wherein the P group contains a sulfur thio linkage are conveniently oxidized to the sulfinyl or sulfonyl linkages. This is carried out using mild oxidizinq agents, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid. A single molar equivalent is employed for the preparation of the sulfinyl group and two equivalents are used to prepare the sulfonyl group. The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and the like or a loweralkanol or mixtures thereof.The reaction is complete in from 10 minutes to 10 hours.To prepare the sulfinyl compound the temperature is generally maintained at room temperature. To prepare the sulfone, temperatures up to 1000C or the reflux temperature are employed. The products are isolated using techniques used by those skilled in the art. The compound where R is hydroxy methyl is generally prepared by reacting pyromellitic diimide R H with formaldehyde in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide. The reaction is carried out preferably in an aqueous solvent at from room temperature to 1000C for from 1 to 10 hours. The products are isolated using known techniques. In the course of investigating the efficiency of feed use, the mechanism by which ruminants digest and degrade the components of their feed to form molecules which can be metabolically utilized has been intensively studied. The mechanism of carbohydrate utilization is now well known. Microorgansims in the rumen of the animal ferment the carbohydrate to produce monosaccharides and then degrade the monosaccharides to pyruvate compounds. Pyruvate is then metabolized by microbZoloqiv prccesses to either acetate or propionate compounds, which may be either acids or other forms of the radicals.Two acetate radicals may be combined thereafter, still in the rumen, to form butyrates. The animal can utilize butyrate, propionate, and acetate with differing degrees of efficiency.Utilization of these compounds which are collectively known as volatile fatty acid VvA occurs after absorption from the gut of the animal. Butyrate is utillzed most efficiently, and acetate the least efficiently. However, the relative efficiency of use to butyrate is negated by the inefficiency of the manufacture of butyrate, which must be made from acetate in the rumen. One of the major inefficiencies in the rumen is in the manufacture of acetate. Since it is made by the degradation of a pyruvate molecule, each molecule of acetate which is produced is accompanied by a molecule of methane. Most of the methane produced is lost through eructation. Since butyrate is made rom two molecules of acetate, each molecule of the relatively efficiently used butyrate involves the loss to the animal of two molecules of methane, with all of the associated energy. Thus, the efficiency of carbohydrate utilization carbohydrates being the major nutritive portion of ruminant animals feed can be increased by treatments which encourage the animal to produce propionate rather than acetate from the carbohydrates. Further, the efficiency of feed use can be effectively monitored by observing the production and concentration of propionate compounds in the rumen. If the animal is making more propionates, it will be found to be using its feed more efficiently. This efficiency is manifested by greater weight gains per feed intake, a reduction in energy losses by methane release, and economic advantages to the animal grower when the animal is sold for consumption. The method of improving the feed utilization of ruminants of this invention comprises orally administering to a ruminant an effective amount of one or more of the above described novel compounds. Of course, the most economically important ruminant animals those with multiple stomachs, one of which functions as a rumen are cattle, sheep and goats. The compounds of this invention are administered to ruminants orally at rates of from about 0.1 mg kg day to about 10 mug day. While that range is functional, the preferred range of rates is from about 0.5 to 5 mg kg day. It has been found that the compounds of this invention increase the efficiency of feed utilization in ruminant animals. The easiest way to administer the compounds is by mixing them in the animal s feed. However, the compounds of this invention can be usefully administered in other ways. For example, they can be incorporated into tablets, drenches, boluses, or capsules, and dosed to the animals. Formulation of the compounds in such dosage forms can be accomplished by means and methods well known in the veterinary pharmaceutical art. Each individual dosage unit should contain a quantity of the feed efficiency improving compound which has a direct relation to the proper daily dose for the animal to be treated. Capsules are readily produced by filling gelatin capsules with any desired form of the desired compound. If desired, the compound can be diluted with an inert powdered diluent, such as a sugar, starch or purified crystalline cellulose, in order to increase its volume for convenience in filling capsules. Tablets of the compounds useful in this novel method are made by conve tional pharmaceutical processes. Manufacture of tablets is a well known and haighly aavanced art. In addition to the active ingredient, a tablet usually contains a base, a disintegrator, an absorbent, a binder, and a lubricant. Typical bases include lactose, ne icing sugar, sodium chloride, starch and mannitol.Starch is also a good disintegrator as is alginic acid. Surface active agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate and dioctyl sodium suiphosuccinate are also sometimes used. Commonly used absorbents again include starch and lactose, while magnesium carbonate is also useful for oilv substances.Frequently used binders are gelatin, gums, starch, dextrin and various cellulose derivatives. Among the commonly used lubricants are magnesium stearate, talc, paraffin wax, various metallic soaps, and polyethylene glycol. This method of increasing the efficiency of feed utilization can also be practiced by the aininistration of the instant compound as a slow pay out bolus. Such boluses are made as tablets are made, except that a means to delay the dissolution of the compound is provided. Boluses are made to release for lengthy periods. The slow dissolution is assisted by choosing a highly water insoluble form of the compound. A substance such as iron filings is added to raise the density of the bolus and keep it static on the bottom of the rumen. Dissolution of the compound is delayed by use of a matrix of insoluble materials in which the drug is embedded. For example, substances such as vegetable waxes, purified mineral waxes, and water insoluble polymeric materials are useful. Drenches of the instant compounds are prepared most easily by choosing a water soluble or water dispersable form of the compound. If an insoluble form is desired for some reason, a suspension may be made. Alternatively, a drench may be formulated as a solution in a physiologically acceptable solvent such as a polyethylene glycol. Suspension of insoluble forms of the compounds can be prepare a in non solvents such as vegetable oils such as peanut, corn, or sesame oil in a glycol such as propylene glycol or a polyethylene glycol or in water, depending on the form of the compound chosen. Suitable physiologically acceptable adjuvants are necessary in order to keep the compound suspended. The adjuvants can be chosen from among the thickeners, such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, and the alginates. Many classes of surfactants also will serve to suspend the compounds. For example, lecithin, alkylphenol polyethylene oxide adducts, naphthalene sulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates and the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters are useful for making suspension in liquid nonsolvents. In addition, many substances which effect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid can assist in making suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone antifoams, glycols, sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents. The suspendable compound may be offered to the animal grower as a suspension, or as a dry mixture of the compound and adjuvants to be diluted before use. These compounds may also be administered in the drinking water of the ruminants.Incorporation into drinking water is performed by adding a water soluble or water suspendable form of desired compound to the water in the proper amount. Formulation of the compound for addition to drin Nir.g water follows the same principles as formulation of drenches. The most piratical way to treat animals with the compounds of this invention usable in this novel method is by the formulation of the compound into the feed supply. Any type of feed may be medicated with the instant compounds, including commondry feeds, liquid feeds, and pelleted feeds. The methods of formulating drugs into animal feeds are well known. It is usual to make a concentrated drug premix as a raw material for medicated feeds. For example, typical drug premixes may contain from about 1 to about 400 g.of drug per pound t54 g. of premix. The wide range results from the wide range of concentration of drug which may be desired in the final feed. Premises may be either liquid or solid. The formulation of ruminant feeds containing the proper amounts of the instant compounds for useful treatment is mainly a matter of arithmetic. It is necessary only to calculate the amount of compound which it is desired to administer to each animal, to take into account the amount of feed per day which the animal eats, and the concentration of compound in the premix to be used, and calculate the proper concentration of the compound in the feed. All of the methods of formulation, mixing, and pelleting feeds which are normally used in the ruminant feed art are entirely appropriate for manufacturing feeds containing the comPounds usable in this method. It is not intended that the scope of this invention be limited to any particular formulations or methods of administration. The invention is a method of increasing the efficiency of feed utilization by ruminant animals by the oral administration of certain compounds regardless of the method of administration of the compounds. It is usual to treat economic animals, including ruminants, with a variety of growth promoters, disease preventives, and disease treatments throughout their lives. Such drugs are often used in combination. the novel method may be practiced in combination with other treatments.
