# ELASTIC ROLL FOR TREATING THERMOPLASTIC FILM

## Abstract
Such a roll is of the kind having a rigid central axis 2 , which is surrounded by a layer 5 of elastic material, over which a tubular thin walled smoothing shell 6 is drawn. The object of the invention is to provide such a roll in which the pressing force is largely uniform over the length of the roll seen in the axial direction and can be adjusted to different pressure values by simple measures. The object is solved by the roll being provided with end plates 10 having conical pressure surfaces 11 which are mounted on the central axis for axial movement with respect to each other, so that said surfaces are able to be pressed against the ends of the elastic layer 5 via tightening nuts 12 to adjust the pressing force of the smoothing shell 6 .
