# Gear synchronizer mechanism in power transmission.

## Abstract
A gear synchronizer mechanism includes a gear mem ber 22 rotatable on a shaft 21 , a hub member 11 arranged adjacent the gear member and fixed to the shaft, and a clutch sleeve 12 encircling an outer cylindrical portion of the hub member. The clutch sleeve 12 is formed at its inner periphery with a plurality of circumferentially spaced radial projections 12b axially movable in the corresponding axial grooves 11b formed in the cylindrical portion of the hub member. A radially contractible C letter shaped spring 14 is supported in place by engagement with circumferen tally spaced inner walls 11c₁, 11c₂ of the cylindrical portion of the hub member. The spring has an intermediate ring portion 14a integrally formed with a plurality of circum ferentially spaced axial legs 14b₁, 14b₂ extending therefrom towards the respective radial projections of the clutch sleeve, the axial legs each having a radial projection to be engaged with each of the radial projections of the clutch sleeve. The spring has a pair of end portions resiliently engaged with one of the inner walls of the cylindrical portion of the hub member to retain the axial legs 14b₁, 14b₂ in place within the respective axial grooves 11b .
