# Solder interconnection structure for joining semiconductor devices to substrates, and process for making.

## Abstract
An improved solder interconnection for forming I O connections between an integrated semiconductor device and a support substrate having a plurality of solder connec tions arranged in an area array joining a set of I O s on a flat surface of the semiconductor device to a corresponding set of solder wettable pads on a substrate, the improvement being a band of dielectric organic material disposed between and bonded to the device and substrate embedding at least an outer row of solder connections leaving the center inner solder connections and the adjacent top and bottom surfaces free of dielectric material.
