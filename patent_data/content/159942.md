# Fluoropolymer composites and novel method for making them.

## Abstract
Fluoropolymer containing films 10 11 are separately formed and applied to substrates 12 to form novel composites. The invention process comprises the steps of 1 separately forming a uniform film comprising a metered layer of a fluoropolymer containing material 2 treating the substrate to facilitate film adhesion and bonding 3 uniformly contacting at least one face of the film with a treated surface of the substrate and 4 transferring the film material to the treated substrate with heat and pressure to obtain a smooth, uniform coated composite. By a decalcomania technique, the film may be cast in a single or multiple layers on a support member, such as a metal foil, drum or belt, and thereafter the face of the film opposite the support member is uniformly contacted with the substrate and transferred. The support member is thereafter removed or stripped from the film to expose the laminated composite surface. Alternatively, the film may be removed from the support member prior to contacting with the substrate.
