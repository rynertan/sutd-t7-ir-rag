# Agricultural implement with automatic depth control.

## Abstract
The depth control system is for a disk tiller or similar ground working implement having a gang of tillage tools 18 on a sub frame 20 adjustably supported from a main frame 12 . A trailing support arm 40 is rigidly connected to the sub frame 20 and carries a gauge wheel 58 on an arm 50 pivo tally mounted at 64 , the wheel being spring biased into enga gement with the tilled soil. As the depth of the tools 18 varies with changing conditions, the support arm 40 moves and the gauge wheel arm 50 pivots with respect to the support arm to rotate a first lever 66 . The first lever is connected to a second lever 68 by a pair of pretensioned springs 76, 78 . Movement of the second lever moves a switch actuating arm 80 which actuates one of a pair of microswitches 82,84 . The micros witches control a solenoid valve 100 to operate a depth con trol cylinder 36 for the sub frame 20 so as to maintain the desired depth of cut. The switch actuating arm 80 is damped by a dashpot 90 which, together with the springs 76, 78 , prevents switch actuation during short periods of oscillation.
