## Description
SUSTAINED RELEASE PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION WHICH COPRISED 2 NROXYETHYL 6 CHLOROPYaIDINE, PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARTION AND USE THEREOF The present invention relates to a sustained release preparation for 2 nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine, which is represented by the following chemical formula EMI1.1 or its occlusion compound with B cyclodextrin. More particularly, the present invention relates to a sustained release microcapsule aimed at keeping a constant level of theblood concentration of the active principal 2 nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine in the body for a long time. 2 Nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine has vasodilating activity and is useful as a drug for the treatment of vascular disorder. 2 Nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine is, however, an oily and volatile substance, and therefore it is in general difficult to make up such substance into a pharmaceutical preparation. Such difficulty could be overcome by converting 2 nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine to its occlusion compound with B cyclodextrin, Generally, with regard to nitrate compounds, which are represented by nitroglycerin and also include 2 nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine,it is well known that after their oral administration, the rate of their absorption into blood and disappearance therefrom are very fast, and that therefore such compounds have the disadvantage of the short effective time. After an inventive study, the inventors of the present invention have found that the above difficulty can be overcome by coating 2 nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine or its occlusion compound with B cyclodextrin, with released control membrane to prepare a sustained release microcapsule. According to this microcapsule, the drug is released sustainedly and consequently and therefore is pharmacologically active for a long time in the body. The present preparation has such an advantage the release rate of the drug is nearly constant zero order release and further, is scarcely influenced by the change of the stirring intensity, pH of an outer medium and so on. The present invention is described in more detail below. The sustained release microcapsule referred to the present invention is a microcapsule coated with semipermeable membrane, which gives the zero order release of the drug without the influence of the stirring condition and pH of an outer medium in its dissolution behavior. The sustained release microcapsule is prepared by coating a granule containing the drug with a basic lubricant membrane. The granules containing the drug is prepared by mixing the drug, excipient e.g. cane sugar, lactose, sucrose, mannite, etc. and other additives commonly used in this field in a conventional manner. The amount.of the drug is preferably 10 to 70 weight percent of the whole granule components, more preferably 40 to 60 weight percent of the whole granule components, but the amount of the drug is not restricted to the above range and may be determined fittingly depending on the intended duration of the drug release, or the like. In these procedures, 2 nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine, the active principal, is such an oily and volatile substance that, this granule may be preferably prepared after conversion of 2 nitroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine to its occlusion. compound with B cyclodextrin. Then,the present invention refers to a method for releasing the. drug.sustainedly from such bed granules. That is, such bed granules are coated with a basic libricant membrane which can control the release rate of the drug. The basic lubricant membrane used here should be independent of pH of an outer medium, and may include a coating material such as acrylate resin e.g.dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate methylmetacrylic acid copolymer e.g. Eudragit E 30 D etc. 1, shellac, cellulose derivatives e.g. ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc. , or the like. The amount of the coating material is preferably 0.1 to 20 weight percent of the whole bed granule containing the drug, but the amount is not restricted to the above range and should be selected depending on the intended duration of drug release, or the like The coating treatment may be carried out with a fluid bed granulator in a conventional manner. However, the method of the coating treatment is not restricted to the above procedure. The detail of the present invention is described below using actual examples of producing preparation and evaluating their quality.Preparation 1 Fuming nitric acid 1.57 ml was added dropwise to acetic anhydride 3.54 ml with stirring at 0 to 50C. 2 Hydroxymethyl 6 chloropyridine 3.59 g was added thereto.

In the present invention, by adjusting the amount of the coating of the release controlled membrane of the drug, the release rate of the drug from microcapsules can be controlled sustainedly. Namely, the rate determining step of the drug release from the microcapsule of the present invention is the step where the release of the drug from the coating membrane, and this characteristic gives rise to the feature of the sustained release preparations of the present invention that the dissolution pattern of the drug is linear and that the dissolution pattern and the dissolution rate scarcely get influenced by the change of the intensity of stirring, the pH of the aqueous medium, or the like.
