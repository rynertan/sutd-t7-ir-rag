# Method and reactor for treating by products from flue gas desulfurization.

## Abstract
A dry particulate sulfite containing material produced in a flue gas desulfurization process is oxidized and agglomerated in a fluidized bed reactor 2 , wherein the material is fluidized in an oxygen containing gas. The oxygen containing gas which is supplied to the flui dized bed 1 has a temperature below the agglomeration tem perature of said particulate material. Due to the exothermic character of the oxidation, the temperature of the fluidized bed 1 is maintained above the agglomeration temperature of the particulate material. Gas and entrained particles leaving the fluidized bed at 7 are coooled during its passing through the freeboard 4 of the fluidized bed reactor, whereby problems due to sticking of said entrained particles are avoided. At least a part of said entrained particles are recycled at 10 to the flui dized bed reactor. A fluidized bed reactor 2 is provided suitable for per forming the combined oxidation and agglomeration.
