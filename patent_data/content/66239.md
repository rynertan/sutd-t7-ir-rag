# Pulse generation circuit using at least one Josephson junction device.

## Abstract
A pulse generating circuit using at least one Josephson junction device for generating pulses of ultrashort and preferably variable duration in response to input pulse signals comprises a first gate circuit having at least one Josephson junction and including a first control current path, a second control current path connected with an input terminal adapted to be fed with a clock input, and a gate current path connected with a first gate terminal adapted to be fed with a DC current of a predetermined amplitude, a first resistor of a predetermined resistance connected in parallel to the gate current path, the first gate circuit making transition from a zero voltage state to a voltage state when a current of a predetermined amplitude flows through the second control current path in a predetermined direction, and a delay means for delaying the clock input by a predetermined period of time and supplying the delayed clock input to the first control current path in the opposite direction to the current flowing through the second control current path.
