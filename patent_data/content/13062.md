# Foundry moulding apparatus.

## Abstract
A foundry molding system for molding and closing cope and drag molds includes a linear idler molding line conveyor adjacent a cooling conveyor. Short powered sections are pro vided at each end of the molding line conveyor 20 for set off from the cooling conveyor to form the assembled cope and drag flasks into horizontally abutting drag and cope sets on the molding line conveyor 20 and for closing and setting on the cooling conveyor the assembled cope and drag molds. Reciprocating index and control means are provided at each end of the molding line conveyor 20 for indexing the sets therealong in abutting relationship. Powered roller detents or locators are provided along the conveyor to hold the flasks to separate, center and retain the flasks for a variety of opera tions such as set down, molding 34 , drag rollover 37 , cor ing, closing and set on. The roller detents at the drag rollover 37 are located in the trunnions of the rollover for operation therewith. Both cope and drag flasks are constructed to coop erate with the rollers of the detents.
