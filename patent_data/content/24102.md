# TOUCH RESPONSIVE ENVELOPE CONTROL FOR ELECTRONIC MUSICAL INSTRUMENT

## Abstract
A touch responsive tonal envelope waveshape control system is provided for an electronic musical instrument which includes cooperating tone generating and keying circuits 11 which are responsive to actuation of a key 18 for initiating the generation and keying of a corresponding tone. The sys tem of the invention includes encoding circuits 17 respon sive to the actuation of a key 18 for producing encoded signals corresponding to the intensity of player actuation of the key and an amplitude control circuit 16 responsive to these encoded intensity signals and cooperative with the tone generating and keying circuits 11 for controlling the peak amplitude of the tonal envelope waveshape in accordance with the intensity of player actuation of the key 18 for initiat ing that tone.
