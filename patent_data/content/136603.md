# Multilayer color photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
Adjacency effects of color photographic material may be increased by dividing a light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer into three emulsion layers sensitive to the same spectral region of the visible light, the uppermost silver halide emulsion layer of which has the highest sensitivity and the lowermost silver halide emulsion layer has the lowest sensitivity, wherein the maximum color density of the uppermost silver halide emulsion layer, after color develop ment, is lower than 0.60 and the maximum color density of both the intermediate and lowermost silver halide emulsion layers, after color development, are each higher than 0.60.
