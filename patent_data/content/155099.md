## Description
ELECTRIC POWER SAVING DEVICE FOR DISCHARGE LAMPS This invention relates to an electric power saving device for reducing the amount of electric power consumed by an a. c. type discharge lamp such as an a. c. fluorescent tube or mercury lamp referred to simply as a discharge lamp hereinafter Conventionally, power saving in the operation of discharge lamp has been realized by one or the other of two methods. In the first, the amount of power consumed by the discharge lamp is reduced by using a transformer to descrease the effective voltage applied across the discharge lamp. In the second, phase control is carried out using a TRIAC, thyristor or the like. In the method using a transformer, however, since the voltage at which a discharge lamp starts to discharge is relatively high, it is not possible to realize a substantial power saving, On the other hand. for theoretical reasons deriving from the nature of the conventional phase control method, the second method inevitably results in a deterioration of the power factor and a reduction in the amount of current consumed by the discharge lamp itself. Moreover. in this method the normal period for restriking of the discharge lamp is made subject to uniform control so that discharge unavoidably becomes unstable. As a result, the method has numerous disadvantages.For example,flickering is likely to occur, the service life of the discharge lamp is reduced, the brightness of the lamp is simpaired, the glow switch of a lamp employing such a switch is kept on constantly, the method cannot be used for power saving with illumination fixtures that use condensive ballasts. and the need for a separate control line complicates the installation of a practicalpower saving system in a building, for example. In view of the foregoing observations and description, the primary object of the invention is to provide an improved electric power saving device for discharge lamp which provides large power saving and assures stable discharge. The electric power saving device for discharge lamps in accordance with the present invention comprises a chopper type main control circuit for connection to an a. c. power source which passes a.c. voltage only between phase ct and phase ss and between phase Cr iL and phase 8 t thereof, where cu B, 0 X and Oc x, a regeneration circuit for short circuiting the discharge lamp and making the discharge lamp a closed circuit during the period that it is cut off from the a. c. power source by the chopper type main control circuit, and a central processing unit for alternately operating the chopper type main control circuit and the regeneration circuit by supplying control pulses of a specific duty cycle thereto. The power saving device of this arrangement operates as follows. The central processing unit produces zero cross signals in synchronization with the voltage phase of the a. c. power source, and further, based on the zero cross signals, produces control pulses of a predetermined appropriate duty cycle. The control pulses are applied to the main control circuit to cause a switching eleeent thereof to conduct only during a first prescribed period of eash cycle and not to conduct during a second prescribed period of each cycle, and are also applied to the regeneration circuit to cause a switching element thereof not to conduct during the first period and to conduct during the second period. In this way, the application of voltage to the discharge lamp can be controlled according to a desired phase pattern.As a result, electrical energy stored in a choke coil or the like of the ballast of the discharge lamp during the period when the switching element of the main control circuit is conductive and that of the regeneration circuit is nonconductive is released and returned to the discharge lamp for consumption thereby during the second period when the switching element of the main control circuit is nonconductive and that of the regeneration circuit is conductive. Figure 1 is a block diagram of a power saving device according to the invention Figure 2 is an equivalent circuit of an ordinary discharge lamp including a ballast Figure 3 is a timing chart showing the state of voltages and currents at different points in the circuit of Figure 1. The invention will now be explained in detail with reference to one embodiment thereof, A block diagram of the power saving device for discharge lamps according to the present invention is shown in Figure 1 in which the numeral 1 denotes an a. c. power source, 2 a discharge lamp constituting the circuit load. 3 a chopper type main control circuit comprising a switching element such as Power Transistor, GTO gate turn off thyristor and the like, and connected in series with the discharge lamp 2, and 4 a regeneration circuit comprising a switching element and connected in parallel with the discharge lamp 2. By 5 is denoted a central processing unit CPU which, in synchronism with the voltage of the a.c. power source 1. produces zero cross signals and duty cycle signals, the latter of which are forwarded to the main control circuit 3 and the regeneration circuit 4. Figure 2 shows an equivalent circuit of an ordinary discharge lamp including a ballast, with the equivalent capacitance denoted by 21.the equivalent inductance by 22 and the equivalent resistance by 23. The oeperation of this embodiment will now be explained with reference toFigure 3, which shows the waveforms present at different points of the device.More specifically. the waveform denoted by 6 is the voltage waveform of the a, c. power source 1, that denoted by 7 the zero cross signal, that denoted by 8 the control signal of prescribed duty cycle, that denoted by 9 the voltage waveform of the discharge lamp 2. that denoted by 10 the current waveform of the power regeneration circuit 4. and that denoted by 11 the current waveforv of the discharge lamp 2.Further, 12 denotes a cowson time axis with respect to the aforesaid waveforms 6 to 11. First the CPU 5 produces the zero cross signals 7, produces the control signals 8, The control signals 8 are forwarded to the main control circuit 3 and the regeneration circuit 4 so that during the period 8a indicated in Figure 3 the switching element of the main control circuit 3 is turned ON and the switching element of the regeneration circuit 4 is turned OFF. and also so that during the period indicated as 8b in the same figure the switching element of the main control circuit 3 is turned OFF and the switching element of the regeneration circuit 4 is turned ON. As a result of the above descrived operation, a voltage of the waveform 9 is applied to the discharge lamp 2. Therefore, the energy stored in the inductance of the choke coil or the like of the ballast of the discharge lamp 2 during the period 8a is released and returned to the discharge lamp during the period 8b to be consumed thereby. Thus, the power regeneration circuit 4 corresponds to a single phase half wave rectifier in an a. c. circuit or to a flywheel diode in a d. c. chopper circuit, whereby it operates to regenerate power. The waveform of the regenerated current is as shown by the waveform 10 in Figure 3, so that the current which flows through the discharge lamp assumes the waveform 11. As is clear from the foregoing, since the power saving device in accordance with the present invention reduces the amount of ineffective current flow, it pronouncedly reduces the amount of current flowing through the load the discharge lamp as seen from the power source side, and also increases the power factor, Or in the case of a load with a good power factor, it exhibits a large power saving effect without impairing the power factor and without substantially reducing the amount of current consumed by the load itself, while at the same time assuring an adequate time interval for restriking of the discharge lamp and thus realizing stable discharge. In othe words, when a power saving device according to this invention and one based on the conventional phase control system are applied to obtain the same degree of power saving, the brightness of the illumination obtained will be higher and the amount of load current as seen from the side of the power source will be lower in the case of the power saving device according to this invention than in the case of the conventional one.
