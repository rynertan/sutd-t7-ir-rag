# EYELET ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An eyelet assembly comprising a plastic eyelet body including a hollow cylindrical portion and a flange formed on the upper end of the cylindrical portion and a plastic seat plate including a center hole in which the cylindrical portion of the eyelet body is fitted is disclosed. The eyelet body includes a plurality of vertically spaced arcuate projections of a predetermined thickness formed on the external peripheral surface of the cylindrical portion. The seat plate includes an engaging portion formed along the inner peripheral edge of the center hole for engaging the projections of the eyelet body. Each of the arcuate projections extends by an angular distance which is less than a quarter of the circumference of the cylindrical portion and the arcuate projections at vertical ly adjacent levels are staggered horizontally so that they do not vertically overlap each other when viewed from the front side of the eyelet body.
