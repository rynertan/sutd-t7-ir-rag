# A method and device for collecting commodities.

## Abstract
Rectangular commodities, such as containers for milk or juice, are moved from a conveyor onto a table to form rows in front of a stepped pusher so as to be pushed by said pusher onto a receiving surface. The commodities arranged in front of the pusher are given a configuration such that the contact sur faces of mutually abutting commodities of each row are forward ly or rearwardly offset with respect to those in the adjacent row. For this purpose, the steps of the pusher have a length which is smaller than the length of a commodity.
