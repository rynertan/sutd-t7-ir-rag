# Low temperature alumina electrolysis.

## Abstract
A method of producing aluminium by electrolysis of alumina dissolved in molten cryolite at temperatures be tween 680 900 C is disclosed. The method comprises the employment of permanent anodes 2 the total surface of which is increased up to 5 times compared to the total surface of anodes in a classical Hall Heroult cell of compara ble production rate. By this means the anodic current density is lowered to a degree which permits the discharge of oxide ions preferentially to fluoride ions at an acceptable rate. Additionally, the electrolyte 4 is circulated by suitable means whereby it passes from an enrichment zone 8 where it is saturated which alumina to an electrolysis zone 1 and back.
