# Process for preparing optically active phenylalanine.

## Abstract
Optically active phenylalanine is prepared by resolving a mixture of a complex of D phenylalanine and an optically active mandelic acid and a complex of L phenylalanine and the said optically active mandelic acid in a solvent containing hydrochloric acid, a carboxylic acid, phosphoric acid or a salt thereof to obtain the complex having the lower solubility and obtaining the optically active phenylalanine from the thus obtained complex. The L isomer of phenylalanine is used in amino acid infusion solutions and as a starting material from which a synthetic sweetner can be produced.
