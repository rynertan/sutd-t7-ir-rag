# Weight actuated feed drop apparatus.

## Abstract
Weight actuated feed drop apparatus 10 including a bracket 14 adapted to be attached to a conveyor system 12 and having an inlet opening therein for receiving material 33 from the conveyor system, and an outlet opening for allowing the material 33 to exit from the bracket 14 by gravity. A valving mechanism 24 is pivotally attached along an axis to the bracket 14 for movement between a first position wherein the valve mechanism closes the outlet opening of the bracket 14 and a second position wherein the valve mechan ism 24 is open to allow material 33 to pass from the con veyor system 12 through the bracket 14 to a container 28 disposed below the bracket 14 . A projection on the valve mechanism is provided for automatically increasing the clos ing force on the valve mechanism 24 as it closes. One end of a flexible line is attached to the valve mechanism 24 and extends over the projection. The other end of the line is attached to the container 28 for holding the container 28 whereby a predetermined amount of material 33 by weight is automatically dispensed into the container 28 , upon which event the valve mechanism 24 automatically closes to insure that no more than the desired weight of material 33 is dis pensed.
