## Description
COMPOUNDS CONTAINING AMIDE LINKAGES FROM MONO AND POLYCARBOXYLIC ACIDS IN THE SAME MOLECULE AND LUBRICANTS AND FUELS CONTAINING SAME The invention relates to dispersant additives and to fuel and lubricant compositions containing them. In particular, it relates to certain amides made from polyamines, monocarboxylic acid and polycarooxylic acid. It is known that in the normal use of organic industrial fluids, such as lubricating oils, transmission fluids, bearing lubricants, power transmitting fluids and the like, oxidizing conditions are encountered which may result in the formation of sludge, lacquers. corrosive acids and the like. These products are undesirable in that they produce oxidation residues or heavy contaminants which may cause normal breakdown of the fluid, leading eventually to severe damage to the parts of the equipment being lubricated. In the lubrication of modem engines, oil compositions must be able to prevent acids, sludge and other solid contaminants from remaining near the moving metal parts.Poor piston travel and excessive engine bearing corrosion may result unless the oil can prevent sludge and oxidation products from depositing in the engine. Bearing corrosion is another serious problem in gasoline engines which operate at an oil temperature of about 14900 3000 F or higher. The most desirable way of decreasing the effect of these problems is to add to the base organic fluid a detergent or dispersant additive capable of dispersing the solid particles to prevent them from interfering with the normal operation of the equipment, thereby leaving the metal surfaces relatively dean. Today, with modem equipment operating under increasingly strenuous conditions, it is desirable to develop new detergents which have improved dispersant properties, which are soluble in the fluid medium to which they are added, and which are themselves stable therein. U.S. Patent 3,714,045 discloses lubricant compositions containing lubricants and a polyimide produced by reacting 1 a hetempolymer produced by reacting an olefin with maleic anhydride in the presence of a free radical inibator with 2 a primary arylamine. U.S. 3,936,480 discloses the reaction of a poyal kylenesuccinic acid anhydride with diphenylolpropane of the formula I and tetraethylenepentamine, pyridine or triethylenetetramine. It should be noted, however, that in all cases wherein diphenolpropane is reacted, a catalyst is used.This is an absolute necessity when a phenolic OH is present, because there will be no reaction with the anhydride without it U.S. 3,868,330 discloses a lubricant or fuel composition containing an additive amount of at least one oil soluble high molecular weight compound made by chlorinating 1 a mixture of a C,, monooxylic acid and a low molecular weight polycarboxylic acid, e.g., succinic acid or 2 a mixture of a Cs, ethyleneically unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon, a low molecular weight monocarboxcylic acid and a low molecular weight polycarbexylic acid. This invention provides a reaction product prepared by reacting 1 at least one fatty monocarboxylic acid containing 10 to 20 carbon atoms, 2 at least one alkenyl or alkylsuccinic acid or anhydride, where the alkenyl group is derived from a mixture of C12 to C2 preferably CI, to C,,, olefins and 3 at least one polyamine of the formula RNH Rt NHlx H wherein R is a hydrocaroyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, Rt is a C, to C, alkylene group and x is 1 to 9. This invention also provides a process for making a dispersant for fuel and lubricating compositions comprising reacting 1 at least one fatty monocarboxylic acid containing 10 to 20 carbon atoms, 2 at least one alkenyl or alkylsuccinic acid or acid anhydride where the alkenyl or alkyl group is derived from a mixture of C12 to C,, olefins and 3 at least one polyamine of the formula RNH R1NH H wherein R and Ri have the definitions given above. The present invention further provides a lubricant or liquid fuel comprising a major proportion of a lubricant or liquid fuel and a dispersant amount of a product obtained by the process described hereinabove. The preferred method of preparing the reaction products of this invention involves reacting one of the two types of acids with the amine at from about 1000C to about 17500. preferably about 15000 to about 1750C, then reacting this product with the other acid at the same tem perature. The two types of acids will be used in such amounts that one type will supply from about 30 to about 90 by weight of the required amount and the other type will supply the complementary amount The quantity of polyamine will be chosen such that the acids react therewith to form amide or imide groups with at least 40 by weight of the avaltaale amino groups. Preferably from about 30 to about 60 of the amino groups are left unreacted, but an effective dispersant is obtained when 60 of the amino groups is reacted with the add mixture. Another method that can be used to form the product involves reacting the amine with a mixture of the acids. The same temperature mentioned for the preferred method may be used for both acid amine reactions. Further, the final product is made by using the same relative proportions of add mentioned above, and the percentage of reacted amino groups in a given product will be the same. The useful fatty monocarboxylic acids have the formulaR COOH where R is a hydrocarbyl group containing 10 to 20 carbon atoms. Among the saturated members covered by the formula are capric, lauric, myristic. palmitic, stearic and arachidic and tall oil fatty acids. The unsaturated members include oleic, linoleic, linolenic, eleostearic and ricinoleic acids. The preferred polycarboxylic adds and anhydrides contemplated have the formula II or III where R is an alkenyl or alkyl group derived from a mixture of Cl, to C,. monomers. Polyamines include triethylenetetramine.tetraethylenepentamine. pentaethyienehexamine, etc. to nonaethylenedecamine, and the methylene, propylene, butylene and amylene counterparts. The additive compositions of the present invention impart valuable properties. as hereinbefore indicated, to liquid hydrocarbon combustion fuels, including the distillate fuels, i.e., gasolines and fuel oils. The fuel dis that may be improved in accordance with the present invention are hydrocarbon fractions having an initial boiling point of at least about 380C 1û0 F and an end boiling point no higher than about 3990 750 F , and boiling substantially continuously throughout their distillation range. Such fuel oils are generally known as distillate fuel oils. It is to be understood, however, that this term is not restricted to straight run distillate fractions.The distillate fuel oils can be straight run distillate fuel oils, catalytically or thermally cracked including hydrocracked distillate fuel oils, or mixtures of straight run distillate fuel oils, naphthas and the like, with cracked distillate stocks. Moreover, such fuel oils can be treated in accordance with well known commercial meth ods, such as, acid or caustic treatment, hydrogenation, solvent refining, clay treatment etc. The distillate fuel oils are characterized by their relatively low viscosities, pour points, and the like. The principal property which characterizes the contemplated hydrocarbons, however, is the distillation range. As mentioned hereinbefore, this range will lie between about 380C 1000F and about 3990C 750 F . Obviously, the distillation range of each individual fuel oil will cover a narrower boiling range falling, nevertheless, within the above specified limits. Likewise, each fuel oil will boil substantially continumousy throughout its distillation range. Contemplated among the fuel oils are Nos. 1, 2 and 3 fuel oils used for heating and as diesel fuel oils, and the jet combustion fuels. The domestic fuel oils generally conform to the specifications as set forth in A.S.T.M. SpecificationsD396 48T. Specifications for diesel fuels are defined inA.S.T.M. Specification D97548T. Typical jet fuels are defined in Military Specification MIL F 5624B. The gasolines that are improved by the additive compositions for this invention are mixtures of hydrocarbons having an initial boiling point falling between about 240C 75 F and about 570C 135do and an end boiling point falling between about 1210C 2500F and about 232 C 4500F . As is well known in the art, motor gasoline can be straight run gasoline or, as is more usual, it can be a blend of two or more cuts of materials including straight run stock, cataytic or thermal reformate, cracked stock, alkylated natu ral gasoline, and aromatic hydrocarbons.The concentration of additive in the fuel will range from bout 0.00001 to about 0.1 by weight of the composition. The additive is effective in lubricant compositions for the purposes disclosed in ranges from about 0.1 to about 10.0 by weight of the total lubricant composition. Preferred is from about 1.0 to 5.0 . In general, the additives of this invention may also be used in combination with other additive systems in conventional amounts for their known purpose. The use of additive concentrations of berated alcohols in premium quality automotive and industrial lubricants further improves upon such fluids fuel economy characteristics. The non metaliic compositions described herein are useful at said moderate concentrations and do not contain any potentially undesirable phosphorus, corrosive suffer or metallic salts. The lubricants contemplated for use herein include both mineral oil and synthetic hydrocarbon or hydrocarboxy oils of lubricating viscosity, mixtures of mineral oils and such synthetic oils, and greases prepared therefrom. The synthetic hydrocarbon oils include long chain alkanes such as cetanes, and olefin polymers such as trimers and tetramers of octene and decene. Such synthetic hydrocarbon oils can be mixed with other synthetic oils, including 1 ester oils such as pentaerythritol esters of monocarboxylic acids having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, 2 poiyglycol ethers, and 3 polyacetals. Especially useful among the synthetic esters are those made from polycarboxylic acids and monohydric alcohols.More preferred are the ester fluids made from pentaerythritol, and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or mixtures of such acids. The following example is offered as a specific illustration of the invention.EXAMPLE A mixture of 1 89g 1.0 mole of tetraethylenepentamine and 712.59 2.5 moles of tall oil fatty acids was heated to about 1750C and was stirred over a three hour period, evolving 45.0 g 2.5 moles of water. A typical tall oil fatty acid contains about 45 59 oleic acid, 45 50 linoleic acid and 1 6 rosin acids. Subsequently, 106 grams 0.25 mole of mixed C,. to C, alkenylsuccinic anhydride derived from ethylene polymerization were added and the mixture was stirred for one hour at 1755C under reduced pressure to aid in the removal of water. The final product was obtained by filtration. The deposit4orming tendencies of a fuel were determined in an 8 hour engine test This accelerated test when run on fuels that contain no detergents, produces an amount of deposit equivalent to the amount observed in 4,000 miles of operation in field tests on taxicab fleets. In accomplishing the test, a Ford 4.9 liter 300 C.I.D. engine was equipped with notched rings to increase the amount of blowby and with a glass throttle body section. The engine was operated for 8 hours, using the fuel under test, at altemate idling and running cycles. In the idle cycle the engine was run for 5 minutes at idling speed of 400 rpm with no load. Then for 1 minute the engine was run at a speed of 2,500 rpm under a load of 30 BPH and a manifold pressure of 31.7 kPa 9.4 in. of mercury . During the running cycle the blowby and part of the exhaust were released into the carburetor air intake during the idling cycle. After 8 hours of operation at alternate run and idle, the carburetor was examined and rated for amount of deposit in the throttle throat The fuel used was a gasoline comprising 40 catalytically cracked component, 40 catalytically reformed component and 20 alkylate, the overall mixture having a boiling range of about 35 2100C.
