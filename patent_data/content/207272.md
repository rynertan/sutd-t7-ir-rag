# A method of producing a thin semiconductor layer.

## Abstract
A method of forming a thin silicon layer 12A upon which semiconductor devices may be constructed. An epitaxial layer 12A, 12B is grown on a silicon substrate 10 , and oxygen or nitrogen ions are implanted into the epitaxial layer in order to form a buried etch stop layer 14 therein. An oxide layer 16A is grown on the epitaxial layer, and is used to form a bond to a mechanical support wafer 100 . The silicon substrate 10 is removed using grinding and or HNA, the upper portions 12B of the epitaxy are removed using EDP, EPP or KOH, and the etch stop 14 is removed using a non selective etch. The remaining portion of the epitaxy 12A forms the thin silicon layer. Due to the uniformity of the implanted ions, the thin silicon layer has a very uniform thickness.

## Description
The present invention relates to a method of producing a thin semiconductor layer of substantially uniform thickness upon which semiconductor structures can be subsequently formed. In the present era of very large scale integration VLSI , in which the dimensions of transistors and other semiconductor structures are shrinking below one micrometer, a host of new problems must be addressed. In general, greater isolation is required between devices. For CMOS applications, this isolation must prevent latch up. At the same time, this increased isolation must not be provided at the expense of available chip space. Silicon on insulator technology appears to be a particularly promising method of addressing this problem. A general example of this technology is shown in the article by R. J. Lineback, Buried Oxide Marks Route to SOI Chips , More recently, a specific method of forming silicon on insulator structures has evolved, in which two silicon substrates are bonded together and one of the substrates is at least partially removed. An example of this method is disclosed in an article by M. Kimura et al, Epitaxial Film Transfer Technique for Producing Single Crystal Si Film on an Insulating Substrate , U.S. Patent No. 4,142,925 issued 3 3 79 to King et al discloses a method of making a structure which includes an epitaxial layer, an insulator layer and a polished silicon layer. As shown in the front figure of the patent, an epitaxial layer is grown on an n silicon substrate. An insulator layer of Si0₂ is grown on the epitaxial layer, and the insulator is covered with a polysilicon support layer. The n silicon substrate is then removed, leaving the epitaxial layer atop the Si0₂ layer. It has been found that the step of removing the silicon substrate without removing the underlaying epitaxial layer is facilitated if these two layers have different doping concentrations or are of different conductivity types. For example, if the substrate is p and the epitaxial layer is p or n type, the substrate may be removed by etching in a 1 3 8 solution of hydroflouric, nitric and acetic HNA acid. A problem with the above process is that the HNA acid will etch to the p p or p n junction, which does not occur at the actual physical interfa ce of these two layers. For example, in order to form a final n epitaxial layer of 200nm nanometers on a p substrate, an epitaxial layer of 1000 1200nm must be deposited. This is because boron will out diffuse from the substrate into the epitaxial layer, such that the p n junction actually occurs at a point approximately 800 1000nm, respectively, above the physical interface between the substrate and the epitaxial layer. Forming a 1000 1200nm layer of epitaxy leads to another problem. Typically, when working in the nm range, the deposition tools used in the industry can deposit a layer with approximately plus or minus 5 percent error. Thus, if the original epitaxial layer is 1000nm thick, the final epitaxial layer i.e. after removal of the p substrate will be approximately 250 50nm thick. When the dopant concentration of the epitaxial layer is sufficiently low, the depletion regions of the channels of FETs subsequently formed on the epitaxial layer will extend to the bottom of the layer. Hence, the threshold voltages of these FETs are at least partially determined by the thickness of the epitaxial layer, such that the above variation in thickness would lead to an unacceptable variation in the threshold voltages of the FETs. Obviously, as the thickness of the epitaxial layer as initially deposited is increased, the resultant thickness variation increases. For example, if the initial epitaxial thickness is 2500 nm, its final thickness would be approximately 250 150 nm. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an improved silicon on insulator fabrication process. It is another object of the invention to provide a silicon on insulator process by which the thickness of the final silicon layer is substantially uniform. It is yet another object of the invention to provide an improved silicon on insulator fabrication process in which the etching of the final silicon layer may be more precisely controlled. These and other objects of the invention are realized in a process of forming a thin semiconductor layer having a substantially uniform thickness. After a thin epitaxial layer is formed on a silicon substrate, ions are implanted into the epitaxial layer in order to form a thin buried etch stop layer therein. The buried layer has etching characteristics which differ from those of the epitaxial layer. After bonding the epitaxial layer to a support substrate, the silicon substrate and portions of the epitaxial layer overlaying the buried layer are removed. Subsequently, the remainder of the epi layer above the buried layer is removed in an etchant which does not appreciably attack the buried layer. The buried layer is then removed. The remaining epitaxial layer has a substantially uniform thickness. This is due to the uniformity of the buried layer, which is in turn due to the uniform concentration of ions achieved during ion implantation. The foregoing and other structures and teachings of the present invention will become more apparent upon a detailed description of the best mode for carrying out the invention as rendered below. In the description to follow, reference will be made to the accompanying drawing, in which As shown in Fig. l, an n epitaxial layer 12 is formed on a p or N 0.008 ohm cm silicon wafer 10. The epitaxial layer 12 is grown using conventional deposition gases such as SiH₂C1₂, SiH₄, SiC1₄ or SiHC1₃. Preferably, SiH₂C1₂ is used at 1050 1080 C. The resulting epitaxial layer can be relatively thick e.g. 2500nm . This is because the initial thickness of the epitaxial layer has minimal bearing upon the final thickness of the silicon on insulator structure, as will be described in more detail below. Note that the dopant concentration of substrate 10 should be 6 X10¹⁸ ions cm² or greater, 1 X 10¹⁹ being a typical choice. Such a concentration is necessary for this substrate to be etched in HNA. When the epitaxial layer 12 is formed on substrate 10, boron will outdiffuse from the substrate such that a p n junction will be established within epitaxial layer 12. The boron atoms penetrate into the epitaxy to form the junction at approximately 400 800nm above the physical epitaxy substrate interface. A buried etch stop layer 14 is then formed within epitaxial layer 12, separating epitaxial layer 12 into a first portion 12A overlaying the etch stop 14 and a second portion 12B laying beneath the etch stop 14. In general, buried layer 14 can be comprised of any element which has etch characteristics that are appreciably different from those of the epitaxial layer 12. For example, buried layer 14 can be formed implanting oxygen ions at a dose of 1 x 10¹⁶ l x 10¹⁸ 0 ions cm² at 160 kev into the substrate, with the substrate being heated to approximately 500 C. The substrate is heated during implantation in order to minimize damage in the portion 12A of epitaxial layer 12 overlaying the buried ions. If oxygen ions are implanted, a buried layer of silicon oxide is formed. Note that nitrogen ions could also be used to form a buried layer of silicon nitride. In addition, carbon ions could be implanted to form a buried layer of silicon carbide. The dosage is one factor determining the effectiveness of the etch stop. Specifically, the higher the dosage, the more effective the etch stop and hence the more planar the resulting epitaxial layer upon subsequent etching. This property will be discussed in more detail later. As the dosage increases, a thinner portion of region 12A is left free of defects. Doses of 4 X 10¹⁶ ions cm² and 1 x 10¹⁷ ions cm² have produced good results, with the latter being preferred. Finally, the implantation energy also affects the position of the ions within epitaxial layer 12. In general, implantation energies of 80 kev and up 160 kev being preferred can be used. Since buried layer 14 is formed by implantation, it has a thickness which is sub stantially uniform due to the minimal deviation of the implant energy. In addition, layer 14 is relatively planar i.e. the upper surface of layer 14 is buried below the exposed surface of the epi layer at the same depth across the entire wafer . Any one of a number of known bonding techniques can be used to bond substrate 10 to a mechanical i.e. physical support wafer 100. In a preferred bonding technique as shown in Fig. 2, a layer of silicon dioxide 16A is grown on epitaxial portion 12A. The thickness of this oxide layer 16A can vary in the range of approximately 1 200 nm, with the upper limit being the amount of epitaxial portion 12A consumed during oxide growth. Preferably, Si0₂ 16A is 45 nm in thickness, and is grown in an oxygen ambient at approximately 800 C. Alternatively, Si0₂ may be pyrolytically deposited upon epitaxial portion 12A, eliminating silicon consumption. In either case, the oxide layer 16A is then bonded to the mechanical wafer 100 by contact in a steam ambient and heating to a temperature within the range of 700 1200 C preferably 900 C for approximately 50 mi nutes. In another bonding technique as shown in Fig. 3, an oxide layer 16B of any thickness e.g. up to 2000 nm is grown on mechanical substrate 100 prior to bonding. Thus, the oxide layers 16A and 16B bond together, forming a very thick oxide layer. Such a thick oxide may be advantageous in high voltage applications. In yet another technique as shown in Fig. 4, a reflowable glass such as borosilicate glass BSG or boro phosphosilicate glass BPSG layer 18 is used instead of silicon dioxide. When the glass is deposited on epitaxial portion 12A, it is advisable to first deposit a 5 100 nm typically 20 nm thick layer of silicon nitride 20. The nitride will prevent out diffusion of impurities from the glass into epitaxial portion 12A during subsequent high temperature processing. Note that when bonding takes place, the bonding temperature must be above the glass transition temperature. For example, using a 4 4 92 BPSG layer of 0.4µm thickness, bonding is carried out in a steam atmosphere at approximately 900 C. Alternatively, a layer of reflowable glass could also be formed on the mechanical substrate 100. After any of the above bonding operations, p substrate 10 is removed to expose epitaxial portion 12B. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 5. One removal method is to grind or lap or otherwise mechanically remove a substantial portion of substrate 10, mechanically polish the surface in order to remove scratches, and then etch the remaining portions of substrate 10 in a 1 3 8 solution of hydroflouric, nitric and acetic acids HNA plus a small amount of hydrogen peroxide. The HNA etchant will remove the remainder of substrate 10, as well as the region of epitaxial portion 12B overlaying the n epi p substrate junction produced by the out diffusion of boron from substrate 10 into epitaxial layer 12. It has been found that by ultrasonically agitating the HNA, the by products of the etch can be removed more efficiently, enhancing the etch selectivity i.e. etching will cease at the p n junction . With starting thicknesses of 2500 nm for the epitaxial layer 12 and 45 nm for oxide layer 16A, the combined thickness of layers 12A, 12B and 16A is typically 2200 200 nm after HNA etching. Substrate 10 is initially mechanically removed in order to reduce total processing time. That is, an alternative to the first removal method is to cover the exposed surfaces of both of the substrates with a thermal silicon dioxide layer, and to remove the thermal silicon dioxide layer from substrate 10 using an etchant such as hydroflouric acid. The substrate 10 is then removed using an etch which has a high etch rate ratio of silicon to silicon dioxide. An example of such an etchant is ethylene diamine pyrocatechol EDP . Thus, the oxide layer atop mechanical substrate 100 protects it during EDP etching of substrate 10, thus eliminating the need for the mechanical removing step. The remainder of epitaxial layer 12B is then removed using an etchant which has a high selectivity of silicon to silicon oxide or silicon to silicon nitride, in the case where the etch stop is comprised of silicon nitride . Preferably, this etch is carried out using ethylene piperidine pyrocatechol EPP at 70 130 C. The inventors have determined that by using EPP, a 6 micron etch stop effectiveness can be achieved with a buried oxide layer 14 having a oxygen ion concentration of 1 x 10¹⁷ ion cm². The effectiveness of the etch stop can be explained as follows. Assume for the moment that after HNA etching the remaining region of epitaxial portion 12B has a thickness which varies up to 6 microns. When EPP etching is completed, this variation is eliminated, such that a uniform thickness of the etch stop layer 14 remains. This improvement in planarity is yet another of the advantages of using an implanted etch stop as in the invention. Other etchants could be used to remove the epitaxial portion 12B. One such etchant is 3 molar potassium hy droxide KOH heated to 35 50 C. However, tests have shown that when using this etchant, an oxide layer having a concentration of 1 x 10¹⁷ oxygen ions cm² achieves an effectiveness of only 1 micron. Therefore, EPP as well as similar etchants such as ethylene diamine pyrocatechol is preferable to KOH, given the dopant oxygen or nitrogen ion concentrations mentioned previously. Then, etch stop 14 is removed. Any etchant which has a high etch rate ratio of silicon oxide to silicon could be used. Alternatively, the layer may be etched in a non selective etch such as CF₄ 0₂ plasma. The final structure is shown in Fig. 6. The remaining portion of the epitaxial layer 12 is substantially planar, and thus is of a substantially uniform thickness. As previously noted, this is due to the uniform distribution achieved by the oxygen ions during the implantation to form the buried etch stop layer 14. If it is desired to reduce the thickness of 12A further, this may be done by oxidation and subsequent etching in BHF. Measurements have shown that the thickness of the remaining portion of epitaxial layer 12 is approximately 350 4nm, which is quite an improvement over the 250 150nm achieved with an initial epitaxial thickness of 2500nm and the methods of the prior art as discussed previously. If needed, the remaining epitaxial layer may be oxidized and etched, or directly etched, in order to remove any residual oxide left over from etch stop 14. An alternate embodiment of present invention is to form the etch stop 14 by implanting boron ions into the epitaxy. An n epitaxial layer is formed on a p substrate as in the first embodiment above. Prior to boron implantation, an oxide layer typically 500 nm thick is grown on the epi, in order to minimize thermal processing after implantation is done. Then boron ions at a dose of 6 x 10¹⁴ ions cm² at 2.0 Mev are implanted through the oxide to form a buried boron etch stop layer. A mechanical substrate is then bonded to the oxide, and the first substrate is removed in ultrasonically agitated HNA, as in the first embodiment. Then the epitaxy is etched in 3 molar KOH at approximately 50 C, to the point where the peak boron concentration in the implanted etch stop is reached. Finally, the remainder of the etch stop is removed using HNA. That is, since the peak boron concentration is above that needed to initiate HNA etching i.e. 4 x 10¹⁸ ions cm² , HNA etching can be initiated. Once initiated, it can be continued to remove the remainder of the etch stop even though the boron concentration falls below this critical concentration. Note that the distance of this second etch stop from the thermally grown oxide is formed by ion implantation and hence is substantially uniform. Both embodiments of the invention as described above result in a thin, uniformly thick silicon layer above an insulator. The final thickness of this layer is independent of the thickness of the epitaxial layer as initially grown. It is to be understood that while modifications can be made to the structures and teachings of the present invention as described above, such modifications fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention as specified in the Claims appended hereto.
