# FUEL AND HYDROLYSIS RESISTANT POLYURETHANE

## Abstract
A polyester polyurethane compound is formed by react ing trans 1,4 cyclohexanediisocyanate with a mixed poly ester. The mixed polyester can be the copolymerization con densation product of an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid or an aro matic dicarboxylic acid, or a separate physical blend thereof reacted with a polyol. The polyurethane can also contain small amounts of non extractable epoxies and car bodiimides. The urethane has very good hydrolytic stability in comparison with prior art polyurethane systems and also very good fuel resistance and anti icing resistance. A prefer red area of use is as aircraft fuel tanks and anti icing com ponents.
