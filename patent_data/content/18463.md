# Barium oxide phenol or substituted phenol catalyzed ethoxylation.

## Abstract
Cresylic acid phenol or alkylated phenols is used to promote barium oxide or hydroxide which is used as an ethoxylation catalyst for the reaction of ethylene oxide and alkanols of all classes. The reaction is carried out at tempera tures of from about 150 to about 200 C to yield the ethoxy lated product. The product obtained has a very narrow high adduct distribution with low levels of by products and unreacted free alcohols. Calcium and magnesium oxides show negligible catalytic effect.
