## Description
MECHANICAL CLAMPING DEVICE FOR ELECTRICAL FLAT CIRCUITS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to means for interconnecting electrical cables or electrical cables and components together without use of conventional, frictionally engaging electrical connectors.2. Description of the Prior Art In our British Patent Specification 1,563,139 there is described an electrical connector assembly which employs a silicone or fluorosilicone rubber washer alone or in combination with a supplementingBelleville washer to sustain the pressure on the electrical contacts between a pair of flat cables or a flat cable and a termination of an electronic component. It was discovered that, at temperatures less than 25 0F 31 C , the rubber washer shrank to the extent that it took a set. This set permitted the pressure on the electrical contacts to become relieved, thereby causing the circuits to open. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes this and other problems by providing an arrangement whereby the pressure necessary to mate the elctrical contacts is a sustained continuous pressure, even during such extreme temperature cycling as between 850F and 3920F 650C and 200 C . It incorporates a cap which applies continuous pressure on the circuitry and electrical contacts, preferably by means of a screw and one or more wave or curved washers. The extent of pressure may involve a screw clamping down on the circuitry either to a mechanical stop or to a specific torque value. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an electrical connector clamping system which is capable of providing continuous pressure upon mating electrical contacts. Another object is to provide for such continuous pressure which is sustainable during extreme temperature cycling, e.g., from 850F to 3920F 650C to 2000C . Another object is to provide for such sustained continuous pressure which is capable of being precisely applied. Another object is to provide for such precise pressure which is not easily susceptible to operator error. Other aims and objects as well as a more complete understanding of the present invention will appear from the following explanation. of an exemplary embodiment and the accompanying drawings thereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is top view of the present invention FIG. 2 is a sectional view of the invention depicted in FIG. 1 and FIG. 3 is a partial view of one of the flat circuits coupled by the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As depicted in FIGS. 1 and 2, a mechanical clamping device 10 includes a base plate 12 and pressure cap 14, between which a pair of flat electrical cables or circuits 16 and 18 are clamped together. Such circuits 16 and 18 are configured as shown in our British Patent 1,563,139 or United States Patent No. 4,125,310, patentedNovember 14, 1978. Cables 16 and 18 may be fabricated from identically chemically milled thin metallic wafers, in which wafer 18 is plated with metallic buttons 20, or formed with equivalent deformations so that, when the two wafers are placed opposing each other and pressed between base plate 12 and pressure cap 14, contact is made only by the buttons.Preferably, the plastic memory of the buttons is used as a spring, which is correlated with a force applied by the opposing plates, as will be further hereinafter described. Base plate 12 is formed with a stepped hole 22 into which a nut 24 is inserted and retained, such as by a press fit. Alternatively, hole 22 may be threaded directly.A plurality of surrounding holes 26 extend through the base plate, into which registration pins 28 are press. fit or otherwise secured. Both pins 28 and nut 24 extend above the surface 30 of the base plate in order to pass through holes 32 and 34 in cables 16 and 18 in order to properly register and align the mating contacts thereof. Pressure cap 14 is. similarly provided with holes 36 and 38 which respectively align with holes 22 and 26.The pressure cap is further provided with a recess 40 into which a screw retaining ring 42 is placed and secured, such as by a press fitting. The retaining ring has a dished configuration to provide a bowl shaped interior 44 surrounded by circular walls 46. Walls 46 are disposed to touch the bottom 48 of recess 40 of pressure cap 14.Thus, dish shaped retaining ring 42 and pressure cap 14 form a compartment 50. In compartment 50 is placed a bolt 52 having a head 54. The head extends through an opening 56 in retaining ring 42 and is provided with a hexagonal opening 68 see FIG. 1 for engagement with an allen head wrench.At least one shoulder 58 underlies head 54. The bolt is completed by a shank 60, which extends through hole 36 of pressure cap 14, and a threaded terminus 62 which is threadedly engageable with nut 24. In this configuration, shank 60 is provided with an end surface 64 which is disposed to abut against an end surface 66 of nut 24 so that, when bolt 52 is fully. screwed into nut 24, shoulders 64 and 66 abut to form a mechanical stop. Sandwiched between shoulder 58 of bolt 52 and bottom surface 48 of pressure cap recess 40 are one or more curved spring washers 70. These washers are formed preferably of a commercially available high carbon steel. The particular curved spring washers used conform to MIL SPEC 846049, No. 1075. Such spring washers have a free standing height of 0.044 inches 0.11 cm which, when preloaded to 0.024 inches 0.06 cm provide a load of one pound 0.45 kg . In the present invention, it is desired to press the spring washer to 0.009 or 0.010 inches 0.2 to 0.3 cm to provide a preloaded height of about 0.018 inches 0.05 cm , which results in a load of about 8 pounds 3.63 kg . It is preferred that two washers be placed together to provide a total load of 16 pounds 7.26 kg .This 16 pounds 7.26 kg results in a pressure of about 10,000 psi 7.031 x 103 kgs sq. m on the faces of buttons 20 when utilizing approximately thirty buttons, 20. Prior to abutment between end surfaces 64 and 66, it is therefore possible to screw bolt 52 down to a specific torque value of less than the illustrative 10,000 psi 7.031 x 103 kgs m2. In operation, circuitry 16 and 18 are aligned and oriented with respect to each other when they are slipped over pins 28 onto base plate 12. Pressure cap 14, as assembled with retaining ring 42, bolt 52 and washers 70r is then located over base plate aligning pins 28 and is clamped down over circuitry 16 and 18 by screwing bolt 52 into nut 24 to either a predetermined torque value or to a positive stop when surfaces 64 and 66 contact. The pressure cap thus is capable of exerting a continuous pressure within a prescribed range upon the contacts of cables 16 and 18 over a wide temperature range without failure. Actual test results showed that repeated connect and disconnect between contacts on cables 16 and 18 in this system performed without failure or set through temperature ranges of 850F to 392OF 650C to 2000C . Although the invention has been described with reference to a particular embodiment thereof, it should be realized that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
