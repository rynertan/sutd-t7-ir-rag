The substitute track table is accessed prior to sending positioning instruc tions to the selected disc unit. If a substitute track exists, the address of the substitute track is sent to the selected disc unit as a positioning instruction. If there is no substitute track, the received positioning information is passed to the selected disc unit as a positioning instruction.
