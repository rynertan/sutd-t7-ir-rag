# Photoresist stripper composition and method of use.

## Abstract
An improved process for removing crosslinked photore sist polymer from printed circuit boards which comprises contacting the printed circuit board with dichloromethane methylene chloride containing from 5 to 10 volume percent of a mixture of methanol and methyl methanoate methyl formate . Each additive must be present at a minimum concentration of one volume percent. Stabilizers for the dichloromethane, such as epoxides, may be present at amounts no greater than 0.5 volume percent.
