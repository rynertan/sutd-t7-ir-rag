## Description
Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant which finds extensive use. The therapeutic range for the drug is from about 50 to 175 ng ml. Lower dosages do not have significant effect and overdosages have substantial side effects which can be life threatening. Overdoses can result in convulsions, coma, cardiac arrhythmias, and anticholinergic signs, such as mydriasis and tachycardia. It is found that the rate of metabolism of the drug can vary widely with individuals, as well as the sensitivity of the individual to the drug. It is therefore necessary to insure proper dosage levels to monitor the plasma level, so that a therapeutic dosage level may be maintained. In monitoring the dosage level, it is desirable that there be a simple, accurate, rapid technique for measuring the nortriptyline level, which can distinguish nortriptyline from other drugs and metabolites of nortriptyline, which might otherwise give an erroneous value of the nortriptyline level. Nortriptyline is closely related chemically to amitriptyline. Techniques reported for the determination of amitriptyline in biological fluids include the use of thin layer chromatography, gas liquid chromatography GLC and GLC mass spectrometry.

As indicated below, the preparation of the above compounds of the invention may involve intermediates of the formula wherein R¹ is Z₂ is hydrogen or thio substituted with alkyl of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and J is hydrogen, methyl, carboxylic acid, ester, amide, halide or anhydride. Assay methods of the present invention include a method for determining the presence of nortriptyline in a sample suspected of containing nortriptyline, which comprises Another assay method hereof includes an enzyme immunoassay method for determining nortriptyline, the improvement which comprises employing 1 an antibody prepared in response to a compound hereof wherein Z³ is antigenic and 2 a compound hereof wherein Z³ is an enzyme. The compounds of the invention can be prepared by the following process. The process begins with a compound of Formula XV which compound is reduced to yield a compound of Formula XVI wherein ψ and ψ may be taken together to form a double bond to an oxygen atom oxo or to a carbon atom substituted with G ψ and ψ therefore being CH G wherein G is an aliphatic group ψ and ψ therefore being CH CH₂ ₂ N CH₃ wherein J is as defined above ψ and ψ, when taken separately, may be, respectively, oxy, usually hydroxy, and an aliphatic group G as defined above. The invention also includes the use of the foregoing compounds in which Z³ is immunogenic, in the preparation of an antibody to said compound and to the compound in which Z³ is an enzyme and to nortriptylene. Reduction is carried out in a manner known in the art. Suitable methods are, e.g., catalytic hydrogenation or reaction with dithionite. The compound XVI wherein ψ and ψ are taken together to form a double bond to an oxygen atom oxo may be then reacted with a Grignard reagent to give a compound of Formula XVI wherein ψ and ψ are taken separately, respectively, as oxy, usually hydroxy, and an aliphatic group G as defined hereinabove. A Grignard reaction is carried out in a suitable manner known in the art. For example, with a Grignard reagent X Mg G wherein X is a halogen atom of atomic number 17 to 35, preferably chlorine or bromine, and G, is a group as defined hereinabove, usually 3 dimethylaminopropyl. This compound may in turn be dehydrated to give a compound of Formula XVI wherein ψ and ψ are taken together to form a double bond to a carbon atom substituted with G ψ and ψ therefore being CH G . Dehydration is achieved by conventional methods. Suitable dehydrating agents are, e.g., p toluenesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid. The process steps described above yield intermediate compounds of the Formula XVI wherein ψ and ψ are as hereinabove defined. The compounds of Formula XVI may further be treated with a reactive derivative wherein R², Y and m² are as hereinabove defined, and Z is a hydrogen atom or alkoxy including sulfur analogs of from 1 6 carbon atoms to yield compounds of the Formula I wherein R², Y and m² are as defined above, and Z is a hydrogen atom or alkoxy including sulfur analogs of from 1 6 carbon atoms. Suitable reaction conditions for this step are known in the art. The reactive derivative is linked to the amino group by a suitable activating group, such as an activated ester, such as an ester group for activating non oxo carbonyl for linking to an amine group, preferably N hydroxysuccinimidyl. The conjugates of the invention may then be made by coupling the compounds of Formula I to a poly amino acid . Conjugation to an appropriate activated poly amino acid is achieved by methods known in the art, e.g., by coupling at a sulfhydryl group of I . Activation of the poly amino acid is also achieved by conventional methods, e.g., by the presence of a halogen atom or an olefinic bond. The intermediate of Formula XV wherein ψ and ψ are taken together to form a double bond to an oxygen atom oxo is 3 nitrobenzosuberone and is prepared by nitrating dibenzosuberone, a compound known in the art. The compound 3 nitrobenzosuberone may be converted to the compound of Formula XV wherein ψ and ψ are taken separately, respectively, as oxy, usually hydroxy, and an aliphatic group of from 4 to 8 atoms other than hydrogen atoms which are carbon and nitrogen, wherein nitrogen is amino, by reacting with a Grignard reagent suitably, as hereinabove described . The resulting compound may then be dehydrated also as hereinabove described to give the compound of Formula XV wherein ψ and ψ are taken together to form a double bond to a carbon atom substituted with G ψ and ψ therefore being CH G wherein G is as hereinabove defined. As described above, any of these compounds of the Formula XV can be converted to a compound of the Formula XVI by reduction according to methods described above of the nitro group to give the amino. A synthetic scheme for preparing the subject compounds is set forth in the following flowchart. This reaction sequence is intended as an illustration only. In carrying out the preparation of the compounds of the invention, dibenzosuberone VI is treated with a nitrating agent, preferably in equimolar amounts, to give 3 nitrodibenzosuberone VII. Reduction of VII is achieved by catalytic hydrogenation or with dithionite giving VIII . Reaction of VIII with a Grignard reagent gave IX, which is dehydrated to yield X. XI is obtained from X by mixing X with an activated ester for linking to the amino group. XI is demethylated under mild alkaline conditions to give XII, which gave secondary amine XIII upon reduction. Poly amino acid conjugates XIV of XIII are prepared by combining XIII with the appropriate activated poly amino acid conjugate to combine with the sulfhydryl group of XIII, e.g., activated by the presence of a halogen atom or an olefinic bond. By employing the above procedure conjugates of nortriptyline and poly amino acids , either antigenic or enzymes, may be prepared. The structure of nortriptyline is present after the synthetic procedure and those elements of the structure which provide for distinctions between closely similar compounds are exposed to allow for formation of antibodies which are capable of distinguishing nortriptyline from similarly structured compounds. The antigenic compounds may be injected into a wide variety of vertebrates in accordance with conventional methods for the production of antibodies. Usually the animals are bled periodically with successive bleeds having improved titer and specificity, then reaching a maximum and diminishing in their specificity and titer. The antibodies prepared in accordance with the present invention are capable of binding with the above antigenic and enzyme conjugates specific for nortriptyline and are able to distinguish between closely related compounds and metabolites of nortriptyline such as amitriptyline and imipramine. As previously indicated, the antibodies and enzyme reagents prepared in accordance with the subject invention find particular use in immunoassays for the determination of nortriptyline. A description of the method for carrying out the immunoassay, which is a homogeneous enzyme immunoassay, may be found in USA 3,817,837.

The resulting warm 30 solution was cooled to 25 and was added dropwise to a solution of dibenzosuberone 20.8 g, 0.1 mole, from Aldrich Chemical Co. in 25 ml of acetic anhydride at room temperature for a period of three hours. After addition, an aliquot was withdrawn, and quenched in water, and partitioned in dichloromethane tlc showed the presence of 3 nitrodibenzosuberone, some fast moving substance, and starting material. The reaction mixture was then added to 2 liters of ice water and the oily product was stirred for half an hour. The resulting aqueous layer was decanted and discarded, and the oily residue on the bottom was dissolved in dichloromethane and washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate and brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO₄ and evaporated to yield light yellow oil which was crystallized by dissolving in warm ether and adding hexane until cloudiness developed. The resulting clear solution was cooled 5 overnight to yield 6.5 g of pale yellow solid 26 yield of 3 nitrodibenzosuberone. The tlc of this material showed a major product and a small amount of impurity the product was used without further purification.

The solids became soluble, and after 15 min. tlc showed complete reaction. The resulting clear solution was then extracted exhaustively with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was washed with saturated NaCl solution, and dried over Na₂SO₄. Evaporation of solvents gave yellow crude product which was chromatographed on a silica gel column and eluted with ether hexane 1 1 to yield 8.7 g 36 yield pure yellow 3 aminodibenzosuberone. A solution of N,N dimethylpropyl chloride hydrochloride 100 g, from Aldrich Chemical Co. in about 100 ml water was made alkaline by adding 10 NaOH to pH of about 11 12. The resulting bi layer solution was then extracted with ether, and the ether extracts were dried over MgSO₄. Then, the ether was distilled using a simple distillation apparatus under 1 atm pressure, and the resulting liquid was distilled at 45 60 mm Hg pressure to yield 54.5 g colorless liquid of N,N dimethylpropyl chloride. To Mg turnings 13 g., 0.54 mole in tetrahydrofuran 53 ml, dried and distilled freshly over the sodium salt of benzophenone was added a few drops of 1,2 dibromoethane J. T. Baker Chemical Co. under nitrogen. After crushing the turnings with a glass rod and noting gas evolution, a solution of N,N dimethylpropyl chloride 32.3 g, 0.27 mole in tetrahydrofuran 150 ml was added dropwise. During this addition the solution was heated sufficiently to maintain a gentle reflux. After stirring for 1 h under reflux, the brown reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature followed by addition of 3 aminodibenzosuberone 12.4 g, 0.056 mole from Example 2 in dry THF 220 ml . The resulting brown product was allowed to stir at room temperature for half an hour and was cautiously quenched with saturated ammonium chloride 200 ml . The resulting yellow residue was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with saturated NaHCO₃ and brine, dried Na₂SO₄ , and evaporated to yield a yellow oil 17.2 g of 3 amino 5 3 dimethylaminopropyl 5 hydroxy 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,e cycloheptatriene. To a solution of 3 amino 5 3 dimethylaminopropyl 5 hydroxy 10,11 dihydrodibenzo b,e cycloheptatriene 17.1 g, 0.055 mole from Example 3 in dichloromethane 300 ml was added trifluoroacetic acid 29.6 ml, 0.175 mole . The resulting dark brown solution was refluxed for 18 hours tlc of an aliquot of the reaction mixture showed incomplete reaction. Therefore, p toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate 10.5 g, 0.055 mole was added and refluxed overnight. After 18 hours, complete reaction was observed. The reaction product was cooled, diluted with ether, made alkaline with concentrated ammonia 22 ml , and then extracted with ethyl acetate. Evaporation of solvents gave a foaming product containing two major components and some impurities of higher Rf values. The samples were purified using preparative HPLC silica gel column, NH₃ MeOH CH₂Cl₂ 0.24 3 97 by volume Fractions were collected and analyzed using both refractive index and analytical tlc silica gel plate, 0.08 1 7 NH₃ MeOH CH₂Cl₂ . Fractions of the same Rf values were combined and evaporated to give 6.8 g cis 3 aminoamitriptyline Rf 0.08 and 3.6 g trans 3 aminoamitriptyline Rf 0.15.

To a solution of cis 3 aminoamitriptyline 2.7 g, 9.3 mmole from Example 4 in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran 80 ml, dried and distilled freshly from sodium benzophenolate and dichloromethane 20 ml, dried over molecular sieves 3A was added the NHS ester of methyldithioacetic acid 2.9 g, 13.8 mmole . The resulting solution was allowed to stir at room temperature. After four days, complete reaction was observed on tlc. The resulting light yellow solution was evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator and the residue was chromatographed on a reversed phase silica gel column containing 300 g silica gel 60 silanized , and eluted with 3 MeOH CH₂Cl₂ 1.4 liter and then 5 MeOH CH₂Cl₂ 600 ml . After evaporation of solvents, 4.3 g light yellow foaming product, which contained the N methyl dithioacetyl 3 aminoamitriptyline was obtained. The product was dissolved in 100 ml of CH₂Cl₂, and 1 ml triethylamine was added. The organic layer was washed with saturated NaCl and dried over Na₂SO₄, and evaporated to yield 3.3 g 86 yield foaming product of N methyl dithioacetyl 3 aminoamitriptyline. To a solution of N dithioacetyl 3 aminoamitriptyline 3 g, 7 mmole from Example 5 in dichloromethane 120 ml, dried over molecular sieves 3A was added trichloethyl chloroformate 9.6 ml, 70 mmoles dropwise at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere followed by triethylamine 9.7 ml, 70 mmoles for a period of 15 min. The slightly warm reaction mixture was cooled using a water bath and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 3.5 h. Complete reaction was obtained as observed on analytical silica gel plates. The resulting yellow solution was evaporated to dryness. Ether 100 ml was added white precipitates which formed were filtered and then washed with ether. The ether filtrates were collected and evaporated to yield a brown oil which was chromatographed on silica gel. Fractions were analyzed by tlc and detected using both UV and I₂ since the product showed a UV chromophore, while the impurities had no UV absorption but showed brown spots of higher Rf values when being developed in an I₂ chamber. Fractions were combined to give 3.2 g, 77 yield N β,β,β trichloroethoxycarbonyl 3 amino N methyldithioacetyl nortriptyline as a white foaming product. Fractions containing impurities were either chromatographed again or discarded since the impurities interfered with the reductive cleavage of the methyldithioacetyl derivative in the next reaction. The sample after column chromatography showed the correct structure. All solutions used in work up of the sulfhydryl derivative were degassed by bubbling argon through each solution at room temperature for at least 10 min. To a solution of N β,β,β, trichloroethoxycarbonyl 3 amino N methyldithioacetyl nortriptyline 500 mg, 0.87 mmole from Example 6 in glacial acetic acid 10 ml was added activated zinc dust 1.5 g at room temperature under nitrogen. The zinc dust was activated by washing well with 100 ml of 2 HCl for 4 5 min, then filtered and zinc powder was washed with water, ethyl alcohol, acetone and dry ether. The powder was then dried overnight at reduced pressure at room temperature and then used for reduction. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. After 22 hours, the reaction mixture was filtered and washed with about 40 ml of water, and the filtrate was cooled in an ice bath. White precipitates Rf 0.95, 114 mg formed and were removed by filtration and discarded, and the filtrate was extracted with 2 x 10 ml ether hexane 1 1 , or until the complete removal of side product. The resulting aqueous solution was then extracted with a total of 200 ml dichloromethane and the organic solution washed with brine and dried over Na₂SO₄. Evaporation of solvents gave a clear viscous oil of the acetate of 3 amino N mercaptoacetyl nortriptyline 104 mg, 29 yield, Rf 0.31 . The product was found to be decomposed under vacuo at room temperature within a day. However, under acidic conditions, e.g., the acetate salt, the product was found to be more stable. The acetate salt of 3 amino N mercaptoacetyl nortriptyline was stored under nitrogen, or argon, and kept at dry ice temperature. To a solution of bromoacetylglycine 1 g, mp. 114 115 in 10 ml of DMF was added powdered NHS 1 g and EDCI 1 g, 5.2 mmole under nitrogen at 0 .

To a clear solution of BSA 1.5 g in phosphate buffer pH 9.0, 0.05 M, 100 ml and DMF 6 ml was added dropwise the NHS ester of bromacetylglycine 500 mg , in 6 ml DMF at 0 For a period of 30 min. Before the addition of the NHS ester, the pH of the BSA solution was about 8.0. After the addition of the NHS ester, the pH dropped to 5 6 the pH 5.86 of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 6.8 and stirred overnight at 5 .

The resulting mixture was then stirred under nitrogen at 5 for a total of 72 hours and dialyzed exhaustively against NH₄OH H₂O 10 x 4 l . The conjugate was then lyophilized to give 194 mg protein hapten number 24 . The above BAG G 6 PDH conjugate was prepared according to the procedure disclosed in US A 4,220,722 at columns 18 19. The conjugate was dialyzed against 4 l of tris buffer without preservatives .05 azide .005 Thimerasol to give 13.8 mg of conjugate in 6.1 ml. A solution of 19 mg trans 3 amino N mercaptoacetyl nortriptyline from Example 7 in 0.5 ml of DMF containing 50 µl of glacial acetic acid was prepared. This solution 125 µl was degassed with argon and was added to the 6.1 ml of the dialyzed BAG G 6 PDH from above. The resulting mixture was stirred for 3.5 h at 4 and then centrifuged. The supernatant was chromatographed on a Sephadex G 50 column and fractions containing protein were collected. The product was 84 deactivated and 40 inhibitable. The hapten material 63 mg from Example 5 was reconstituted in 1.5 ml degassed DMF.

The hapten was added slowly with stirring to a hapten to enzyme ratio of about 95. The inhibition against anti DMI antibodies was 45 50 . The G 6 PDH conjugate was then desalted at 4 over a G50 column with tris buffer .055 M, pH 8.0 with preservatives. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of compounds prepared in accordance with the subject invention, antibodies produced in the conventional manner in response to the conjugate of Example 8 and the enzyme conjugates prepared in Example 11 were employed in a number of assays for nortriptyline. In carrying out the assay, a Gilford Stazar spectrophotometer was employed with a Thermocuvette with a flow cell. All readings were made at 340 mn. The following solutions were prepared as reagents for use in the assay. The protocol employed for carrying out an assay was as follows The sample was treated first to remove metabolites. A 100 mg C 2 column was washed with approximately one ml of methanol followed by approximately one ml of water. The sample 500 µl was placed on the top of the column. A vacuum apparatus was attached to the bottom and a vacuum was drawn on the column. The eluate obtained was discarded and the column was washed with 900 µl of a solution which was 70 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.2, 30 acetonitrile, and 5 mM heptane sulfonate. A vacuum was again drawn on the column and the eluate was discarded. Next, the column was contacted with 500 µl of a solution which was 50 acetonitrile, 25 methanol, and 25 5 mM K₂HPO₄, pH 7. The eluant was collected and used in the assay procedure. Into a diluter was drawn 15 microliters µl of the above sample. The sample was dispensed with 250 microliters of the assay buffer into a one milliliter Croan cup. Into the Croan cup was introduced 15 µl of the antibody reagent with 250 µl of the assay buffer, followed by the addition of 15 µl of the enzyme reagent and 250 µl of the assay buffer. Immediately after the enzyme addition, the entire sample was aspirated into the flow cell. After 10 seconds, a first reading was taken, followed by a second reading after a 50 second interval.
