# Surgical irrigator evacuator.

## Abstract
A surgical implement comprising an irrigator evacuator includes a reservoir 14 connected to one side of the barrel 10 of a pump having an outlet opening 11 at one end. Fluid can be displaced outwardly and withdrawn into the implement by means of a compression bulb 12 or other suitable device. A free piston 15 is housed in the barrel 10 so as to be mov able in either direction by fluid flow. The piston is retracted by inflowing liquid and thereby allows free passage of pieces of tissue or other material from the opening 11 towards the res ervoir 14 . Outward displacement of the fluid causes the pis ton 15 to move towards the outlet end of the barrel 10 , in which position it effectively prevents such pieces of tissue from being returned through the opening 11 without signifi cantly restricting fluid flow.
