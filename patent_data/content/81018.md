## Description
IMPROVED DAMPED IDLE POINTER ASSEMBLY This invention relates to damped idle pointer assemblies such as utilized on indicating instruments, for example those of a maximum reading type such as maximum demand indicators. The invention, however, is not necessarily confined thereto. These instruments are characterised by an active or indicating pointer which performs the functions of indicating the magnitude or value of measurement and of pushing the idle pointer up the scale where it remains to show the highest value which has been reached over a given period. At the end of this period, the idle pointer is reset either to zero, or to the position of the active pointer, ready for the next indicating period. The product under measurement may be any physical or measurable quantity, such as water flow or volume, gaseous or liquid pressure, electrical functions such as voltage, current or energy. Fundamental requirements of an idle pointer assembly are 1 It does not impose a significant loading i.e. cause inaccuracy of the active pointer. 2 It must possess sufficient friction to remain at the setting where it has been left by the active pointer. 3 It should not be affected by external condi tions such as temperature, moisture, vibra tions or magnetic fields. 4. It should be a simple practical assembly, which will function indefinitely without maintenance. This damping effect has been achieved in the past by various methods, such as friction derived from the movement of silk thread over a drum, or a moving and fixed plateclutch arrangement with silicone grease between the plates to provide dying or by a wide variation of systems using spting pressure derived from coil springs, spring clips, leaf springs and the like. These forms of assemblies are either expensive, or. give unreliable results due to the requirement for regular adjustment with changing ambient conditions and with age. Furthermore, in all of these instances careful machining of components in production is necessary. The principal object of the invention, therefore, is to provide a damped idle pointer which substantially avoids the above noted defects and yet is of simple and cheap construction. In accordance with one general form of the invention there is provided a damped idle pointer assembly comprising a mounting member for attachement to the body of an instrument, a spindle supported on said member, a pointer arm on said spindle and having a hub rotatable about the axis of said spindle, two frictionally coacting surfaces respectively supported relative to said pointer arm and said mounting member, and magnetic means the flux of which acts upon at least one of said surfaces to effect mutual engagement of said surfaces and through their surface friction to dampen rotational movement of said pointer arm. The invention will be better unaerctood trom the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a front view of a typical maximum demand indicator incorporating an idle pointer assembly according tothis invention Fig. 2 is a fragmentary sectional view on the lineII II of Fig. 1, and, Fig. 3 is a similar view to Fig. 2 of a second embodiment of the invention. The invention will now be described with reference toFigs. 1 and 2 wherein the idle pointer assembly 4 is designed for installation upon the frame body 5 of a maximum demand indicator 6. It will be obvious from an understanding of the following description that the principle of this invention may have different applications not necessarily for the damping of the idle pointer arms of measuring instruments.However, it is a characteristic of maximum demand indicators that once sealed within an enclosing casing 7 are not attended thereafter for long periods of time, excepting for regular resetting. It is of importance that idle pointer assemblies such as 4 attched to such indicators 6 be sufficiently damped in their movement to safeguard against changes in their indexation due to vibration of any kind experienced by the indicator itself. The assembly 4 of this invention consists of a housing 8 composed of two spaced confronting plates 8A and 8B riveted or otherwise secured together so that the housing is hollow and open sided. The housing 8 is secured by its opposite ends 9 and 10 to the frame body 5 of the maximum demand indicator 6 by adhesive or any suitable means.Instead of utilizing a housing 8 whereby the assembly may be supplied as an accessory to an indicating instrument 6, the housing 8 may be provided only as the supporting plate 8A with the frame body 5 serving as the other confronting plate 8B. An upright spindle 11 extends between the mid points of the confronting plates 8A and 8B and a small disc shaped permanent magnet 12 provided with a central bore encircles one end of the spinale 11. The supporting plate 8A is preferably composed of magnetic material whereby the magnet 12 by its own magnetic attraction is held firmly against an inner face 13 of the supporting plate 8A. A pointer arm 14 is provided with a hub 14A having a hole at its centre and located over the spindle 11 to one side of the permanent magnet 12. A bearing plate 15 of polished metal, or other magnetic material may be fixed to the pointer arm 14 about the hole therein so as to confront one surface of the magnet 12. The bearing plate 15 and the pointer arm hub 14A, therefore, will be attracted by the permanent magnet 12 so that the confronting faces of the magnet 12 and the bearing plate 15 function as frictionally coacting surfaces. It will be appreciated that any rotational movement of the pointer arm 14 about the axis of the spindle 11 will be damped by the friction existing between the said surfaces. The degree of damping will be a measure of the flux of the permanent magnet 12 and the area of the coacting surfaces.In designing such an assembly it is also feasible to introduce shims not shown between the permanent magnet 12 and its associated supporting plate 8A.Furthermore, as the assembly of pointer arm 14, magnet 12 and spindle 11 is virtually held together by the magnetic flux in the magnet 12, production and assembly tolerances between components is far from stringent. It will be apparent that the positions of the bearing plate 15 ana the permanent magnet 12 may be interchanged so that the latter is carried upon the pointer arm hub 14A while the former is incorporated in the supporting plate 8A.Another alternative, as shown in Fig. 3, is for the surface friction between coacting surfaces to be derived by magnetic repulsion as opposed to magnetic attraction as already described. In such an instance two bearing plates 16 and 17 confronting each other on the opposite side of the pointer arm hub 14A from the permanent magnet 12 may be included.Preferably, the bearing plate 16 carried by the pointer arm hub 14A in such an instance will be of magnetised material so that a like pole thereof confronts the adjacent pole of the permanent magnet 12. The two bearing plates 16 and 17 will therefore be forced together against the plate 6b for frictional engagement by the magnetic repulsion between the magnet 12 and the plate 16. In the operation of the instrument 6, shown purely for illustrative reasons as an electrical meter, the indicator 18 will sweep over the calibrated scale 19 according to the electrical value being monitored and if a value above 18 on the scale is registered the indicator 18, which underlies the pointer 14 will engage the tab 20 on pointer 14 and carry the latter up the scale against the friction created between the coacting surfaces on the magnet 12 and bearing plate 15, or between the two bearing plates 16 and 17 of Fig. 3. When the indicator returns to a lower value the pointer 14 will remain steady to record the maximum peak value registered. A preferred embodiment and several obvious modifications have been described in the foregoing passages but it should be understood that other forms and embodiments are possible within the scope of this invention.
