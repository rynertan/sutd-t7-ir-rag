# Optical information reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical information reproducing apparatus for repro ducing an information recorded on a recording surface of a disc shape record medium is disclosed, which includes an optical pick up device mounted on a tiltable optical block and having a laser beam source for generating a laser beam and a photo detector for detecting the reflected beam from the recording surface and for reproducing the recorded informa tion, a device for rotating the record medium, a skew error detector for detecting a skew of the record medium relative to the optical pick up device and for generating a skew error signal having a D.C. component and an A.C. component, a control circuit supplied with the skew error signal and for generating a control signal responsive to the D.C. compo nent of the skew error signal, a skew error corrector controlled by the control signal and for controlling the optical block so that the optical axis of the pick up device is maintained to be always perpendicular to the recording surface. The above control circuit includes a comparator for comparing the level of the skew error signal with a threshold level and for generating an output pulse, the width of which corresponds to the D.C. component of the skew error signal, and a pulse width discriminator for discriminating the width of the output pulse relative to a reference pulse correspond ing to a rotating period of the record medium.
