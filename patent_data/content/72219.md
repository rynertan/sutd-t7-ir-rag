# Memory addressing system.

## Abstract
Addressing systems are described which enable the size of the addressable memory space to be increased. A first memory from which data is normally read and a second memo ry into which data is normally written are assigned to the same address space. In a first mode of operation the first memory can be selected by a read a signal and the second memory by a write signal. In a second mode of operation the first and sec ond memories are selected by write and read signals respec tively. Arrangements are described where the first memory is ROM and the second memory RAM and in the second mode of operation the RAM is accessed for both reading and writing. The arrangements of the memories in the addressable memory space is alterable.
