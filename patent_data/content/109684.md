# Tunnel freezer.

## Abstract
Tunnel freezer for freezing products which are trans ported through the tunnel freezer from an infeed end to an outfeed end. Close to the outfeed end of the tunnel spray nozzles are provided for spraying the products with liquified nitrogen or similar. The tunnel comprises circulation fans positioned upstreams of the nozzles. The circulation fans comprise at least one paddle wheel 20 positioned immedi ately above the products. The paddle wheel has paddles 22 , the radial length of which is 20 to 60 preferably 50 of the radius of the fan wheel. Preferably also a fan wheel is arranged below the conveyor 33 between the two paths of the conveyor, whereby said paddle wheel is driven by e.g. a chain or belt transmission. Moreover, the tunnel is divided in compartments by partitions, whereby the partition posi tioned at the infeed end of the fan wheel is positioned closer to the fan wheel than the partition which is positioned at the outfeed end of the fan wheel. The partitions are curtains which are made of a flexible material, such as glass fibre reinforced Teflon polytetrafluoroethylene .
