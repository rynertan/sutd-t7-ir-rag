## Description
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal composition, and, more particularly, to a liquid crystal composition for use in a twisted nematic effect type TN type liquid crystal device which is time divisionally driven at a high degree. The use of liquid crystal devices in TV sets, computer terminals and OA equipment is becoming more popular. As liquid crystal devices used in such equipment, devices of a matrix display type, displaying a number of pixels in rows and columns, are frequently used. In order to increase the display capacity, a number of pixels must be time divisionally driven, and, more specifically, time divisionally driven at a high degree. A TN type liquid crystal device to be thus time divisionally driven must have a fast response time and a high contrast. As a conventional liquid crystal composition for use in a TN type liquid crystal device, one for a compact device is known. This composition contains, as a main component, a liquid crystal compound of the type wherein a substituted cyclohexane ring is bonded by esterification with either a substituted benzene ring or a substituted cyclohexane ring. This composition contains, in addition, an Np type Δε 0 liquid crystal compound. The response time of a liquid crystal can be represented by the time Tr required for a transmittance to change from 90 to 10 rise time , and a time Td required for the transmittance to change from 10 to 90 fall time . The rise and decay times Tr and Td of a liquid crystal are proportional to its viscosity. The rise time Tr depends on the electric field intensity and the decay time Td depends on the thickness of a liquid crystal layer. In order to reduce the response time of the liquid crystal device, a liquid crystal having a low viscosity and a large dielectric anisotropy must be used, and a thin liquid crystal layer must be formed. The contrast of a liquid crystal device depends on the gamma characteristics given by V90 V10 , where V90 is a voltage at which the transmittance of the liquid crystal is 90 , and V10 is a voltage at which the transmittance of the liquid crystal is 10 . According to a report by M. Schadt et al., Z. Naturforsch., 37a, 165 1982 and Proceedings of the SID 23 1 , 29 1982 , if a voltage corresponding to a liquid crystal transmittance of 50 is represented as V50 when a value P given by V50 V90 V90 is minimum, optimal time divisional characteristics, steep gamma characteristics, and a high contrast are obtained. The value P is given by When the third term of the right side is 0, the value P is minimum. If the wavelength 500 nm, at substantially the center of the visible light spectrum, is represented as λ when the following equation is satisfied However, since such a conventional liquid crystal composition has a low value of Δn, if the equation Δn d 1 is satisfied to obtain steep gamma characteristics, the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer must be increased. When the thickness d is increased, the decay time Td is increased and the intensity of an electric field applied to the liquid crystal layer is reduced. Therefore, the rise time Tr is also increased. In view of this, the application of a high drive voltage may be proposed in order to perform high speed operation. However, an optimal drive voltage for driving the liquid crystal within a transmittance range of 50 to 90 by time divisional drive is fixed. For this reason, when the drive voltage is increased, the liquid crystal cannot be controlled within the above mentioned transmittance range. Consequently, a fast response time cannot be obtained by increasing the drive voltage. In contrast to this, when the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer is reduced in order to obtain a fast response time, the condition Δ n d 1 is not satisfied, so that the gamma characteristics become moderate and a high contrast cannot be obtained. In addition, the above mentioned liquid crystal composition contains a main component having a slow response time and a low contrast. In this manner, a liquid crystal device using a conventional liquid crystal composition has a poor response time characteristic and a low contrast. DE A1 33 37 316 discloses a liquid crystal composition for a projector apparatus. This known liquid crystal composition can comprise compounds covered by general formulas I, II, VIII and further VII and or IV as defined in the present specification. This citation does not disclose mixtures containing compounds as represented by general formula VI. While this citation is generally silent on the specific mixing ratios, it does teach to use very small amounts of compounds according to general formula VII, and to use these only in special cases. Amounts of less than 20 by weight should be used, since otherwise the temperature range of the liquid crystal material is impaired. On the other hand, this known liquid crystal composition has as much as 70 by weight or more of compounds according to general formulas I and II. While this composition would certainly provide a large value of Δn, melting point and clearing point would be low and especially, the composition would have a high viscosity. A low viscosity is highly advantageous, since it leads to a high response speed. The prior art composition fails to provide large Δn values and low viscosities at the same time and discourages using high amounts of compounds according to general formula VII, which are necessary for obtaining low viscosity values. It is the object of the present invention to provide a liquid crystal composition which has a fast response time and a high contrast, and which can be suitably used in a TN type liquid crystal device which is time divisionally driven at a high degree. In order to achieve the above object of the present invention, there is provided a liquid crystal composition, constituted of A first liquid crystal material containing at least two liquid crystal compounds selected from the group consisting of the compounds represented by general formulas wherein each of R¹, R², and R³ is independently a normal alkyl group having 2 to 7 carbon atoms a second liquid crystal material containing at least one liquid crystal compound selected from the group consisting of the compounds represented by general formulas wherein each of R⁴, R⁵, R⁶, R⁷, R⁸ and R⁹ is independently a normal alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms and a third liquid crystal material containing at least one liquid crystal compound represented by general formula wherein each of R¹⁰ and R¹¹ is independently a normal alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and at least one liquid crystal compound selected from the group consisting of the compounds represented by general formulas It was found that in order to achieve the above object, the liquid crystal composition must be an Np type Δε 0 nematic liquid crystal having a low viscosity and a large Δn. In order to provide such a liquid crystal composition, the present inventors made extensive studies from which they found that the desired effect can be obtained by mixing three specific types of liquid crystal material, as described subsequently.

Additionally, the liquid crystal composition of the present invention contains a liquid crystal compound which serves primarily in reducing the response time, which has a low viscosity and a small Δ ε e.g., Δε αµρ 0.5, and whose gamma characteristics become steep when the ratio Δε ε is small. . This type of liquid crystal compound is selected from liquid crystal compounds represented by general formulas wherein each of R⁴, R⁵, R⁶, R⁷, R⁸ and R⁹ is independently a normal alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms . These compounds can be used singly or in an admixture of two or more, the resultant liquid crystal material being referred to as a second liquid crystal material. The second liquid crystal material contains, preferably, a compound of general formula IV . The liquid crystal composition of the present invention further contains a liquid crystal compound which serves mainly to impart steeper gamma characteristics i.e., higher contrast and to increase the nematic isotropic phase transition N I point, and which has a largeΔn. e.g.,Δn 0.18 , a high N I point, and a low viscosity.

The third liquid crystal material contains a compound of general formula VII and at least one compound of general formulas VIII , IX and X . The three liquid crystal materials described above are mixed in a mixing ratio such that the resultant composition has a positive Δε. More specifically, based on the total weight of the composition, the first liquid crystal material is contained in an amount of 30 to 51 by weight, the second liquid crystal material is contained in an amount of 20 to 40 by weight, the compound of general formula VII is included in the third material in an amount of 15 to 30 by weight and the compound of general formula VIII, IX or X is included in the third material in a total amount of 4 to 17 by weight, all based on total amount of composition.

As described above, the liquid crystal composition of the present invention consists mainly of a liquid crystal material of a type wherein a cyclohexane ring is directly bonded with a benzene ring. Therefore, the composition of the present invention has a low viscosity and a large Δn. Even when the condition Δ n d 1 is satisfied, the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer is not increased thus a fast response time is obtained. Furthermore, even if the thickness d of the liquid crystal layer is reduced, the condition Δ n d 1 can be satisfied so that steep gamma characteristics and a high contrast can be obtained.
