# AERATED DRINKS MACHINE

## Abstract
An appliance for making an aerated beverage, in which a container of pressurized liquid carbon dioxide is mounted on a connection in a casing, the casing being mounted thereon, a housing for a bottle partly filled with water, means for supporting the bottle in the housing, a nozzle communicat ing with the carbon dioxide container and a stopper for engaging in the neck of the bottle. A manually operable valve is provided to allow carbon dioxide to enter the nozzle so that it is dissolved in the water. A displacement body on the nozzle is provided so that when a partly filled bottle is introduced with the nozzle therein, the level of the water rises so that only a small amount of air is left above the water in the bottle, thus reducing the wastage of carbon dioxide.
