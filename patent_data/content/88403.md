# Processing of guayule material by volatilizing and heating steps.

## Abstract
Resins, extracts and resinous material from guayule plants can be processed by volatilizing and heating to convert it to useful gaseous and liquid products. Such processing, for example in the presence of cracking catalysts, can lead to or ganic gases and liquids useful as fuels, lubricants and chemi cal feed stocks. Typically guayule resin is processed at about 200 800 C and a residence time of 0.001 2 hours to provide li quid hydrocarbon tractions.
