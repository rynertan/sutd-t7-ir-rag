# NUMERICAL CONTROL DEVICE.

## Abstract
A numerical control apparatus having both a large capacity non volatile magnetic bubble memory 1 and a high speed volatile IC memory 2 for storing machining program data. When power is supplied from a power supply to the numerical control apparatus, machining program data stored in the magnetic bubble memory 1 is transferred to, and stored in, the IC memory 2 through an interface circuit 4 which administers the transfer of data between the memories 1 and 2 . A processor 3 accesses the IC memory 2 to execute numerical control processing.
