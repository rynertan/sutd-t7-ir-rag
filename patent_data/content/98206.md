# FLEXIBLE STRIP CURTAIN

## Abstract
An improved flexible strip door 28 for sealing the openings into an enclosure such as a coolant and chip enclosure on a machine tool comprises an plurality of flexible strip 32 members which each extend vertically downwardly from the enclosure opening so as to be parallel to and contiguous with each other. Each strip member 32 is fabricated of a pair of elastomeric strips 36a, 36b which are fastened at their side and bottom edges in face to face relationship to create a pocket 38 therebetween having an opening in the top thereof. During intervals when an object is to enter or exit an enclosure opening, the flexibility of each strip 32 allows it to drape on the object to allow passage of the object through the strip door 28 . When the opening is to be sealed following passage of an object therethrough, compressed air is forced into the pocket 38 of each strip member 32 to force the strip members 32 downwardly including those which may still be draped on the object, so that the strip members 32 seal the enclosure opening.
