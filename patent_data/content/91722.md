# Method of treating foil for electrolytic capacitors.

## Abstract
A method of treating foil for use in electrolytic capacitors in which the foil 1 moves in one direction through a treatment liquid and in which the capacitance is measured continuously by means of at least one current carrying electrode 2, 3 from which alternating current is conveyed and at least one voltage electrode 5, 6 at a small distance from the foil. The foil capacitance is measured by means of a phase sensitive voltmeter 8 . The measured capacitance is used to control the treatment method, etching or forming. In a preferred embodiment two current carrying electrodes 2, 3 are present on either side of the foil and two voltage electrodes are present between the current carrying elec trodes and the foil 1 on either side thereof. This avoids contacting of the foil.
