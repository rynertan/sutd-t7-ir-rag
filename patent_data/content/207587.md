# High concentration sodium permanganate etch bath and its use in desmearing and or etching printed circuit boards.

## Abstract
A high concentration aqueous NaMnOâ‚„ solution which provides a high etch rate for printed circuit boards and the like. The solution contains NaOH in an amount sufficient to allow the removal of substantially all the manganese residues from the treated substrate by acid neutralization. The solution can be used inter alia for desmearing and etching back.
