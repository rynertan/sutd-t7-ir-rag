## Description
TRIHALO AMINE GOLD III COMPLEXES This invention relates to gold III complexes comprised of a nitrogen containing ligand and chloride or bromide. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions which contain one or more of said complexes as an active ingredient and to a method for the treatment of tumors via the administration of same. Aminegold complexes are disclosed in the literature but none of these have proven to be clinically useful in the treatment of tumors therefore, this invention constitutes an advance in the art because it adds to the known family of anti tumor agents a new and rationally developed class of aminegold III complexes. The discovery that Cisplatin is effective against human cancers aroused interest initially in precious metal complexes as a source of anti tumor agents. Although many new platinum compounds have been shown to be useful in the treatment of tumors and although some gold complexes are used in the treatment of arthritis, D.H. Brown, et al Chemical Society Reviews,Vol. 9 page 217 240 1980 there is no evidence in the literature to suggest that trihalo amine gold III complexes can be used as anti tumor agents. Accordingly, there is a need for gold complexes which exhibit anti tumor activity and which can be administered orally or parenterally. THE INVENTION This invention relates to a novel class of trihalo amine gold III complexes which are useful as anti tumor agents in mammals. These compounds exhibit excellent activity against malignant tumor cells in animals as well as low mammalian toxicity. It is a further object of this invention to provide gold complexes which may be administered both orally and parenterally. In its broadest aspects, this invention relates to gold complexes having the formula AuLX3 where Au represents gold, L is a nitrogen containing ligand such as an aliphatic amine, an aromatic amine or a heterocyclic amine and X is chloride or bromide. More specifically, this invention relates to compounds of the formula EMI2.1 wherein Au represents gold in its trivalent state, i.e., Au III L is a member selected from the group consisting of a pyridine of the formula EMI2.2 wherein R is selected from among C1 6 alkyl as, for example, methyl, ethyl,n propyl and the like carboxy C2 6 alkanoyl as, for example, acetyl,n propionyl or n butyryl and the like carboxy C1 6 alkyl as, for example, carboxymethyl or carboxyethyl and the like carbinol hydroxy and n propoxy and the like a pyridazine of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R2 is selected from among hydrogen and the same groups as R1 a pyrimidine of the formula EMI3.2 a pyrazine of the formula EMI3.3 an imidazole of the formula EMI3.4 wherein R3 is C16 alkyl as, for example, methyl, ethyl and the like a pyrazole of the formula EMI3.5 wherein R4 is hydrogen or C16 alkyl as, for example, methyl, ethyl, and the like and alkylamine as, for example, an alkylamine of from about 1 6 carbon atoms but, preferably, a lower alkylamine of from about 1 3 carbon atoms such as methylamine, ethylamine, isopropylamine and the like an arylamine of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R5is C16 alkyl, C16 alkoxy, hydroxy, c26 alkanoyl, or halo such as chloro, bromo, or fluoro and the like and n is an integer having a value of 0 3 and X is selected from the group consisting of chloro or bromo with the proviso that X represents chloro when L represents 3 pyridylacetic acid. The proviso in the definition of X excludes a species which is inactive as an anti tumor agent under the test conditions hereinafter described. This species is the product formed when X represents bromo and L represents 3 pyridylacetic acid, that is, the tribromo 3 pyridylacetic acid gold III ofExample 10. See in this regard the ILS data for this compound in Table 1, infra. By contrast, the complex which results whenX is chloro and L is 3 pyridylacetic acid i.e., trichloro 3 pyridyacetic acid gold III 1 exhibits a pronounced anti tumor effect. The compound wherein L is pyridine R1 is hydrogen is referred to in the literature but no utility is suggested. It is useful herein to produce active pharmaceutical compositions. A preferred embodiment of this invention relates to gold III complexes in which the nitrogen containing ligand is a mono substituted pyridine or imidazole of the formula EMI5.1 wherein L1 is a member selected from the group consisting of a pyridine of the formula EMI5.2 wherein R1 is selected from among carboxy, C2 6 alkanoyl, carboxy C16 alkyl, carbinol, hydroxy and C1 6 alkoxy and an imidazole of the formula EMI5.3 wherein R2 is hydrogen and R3 is C1 4 alkyl and X is selected from the group consisting of chloro or bromo, with the proviso that X1 represents chloro when L1 represents 3 pyridylacetic acid. This class of complexes exhibits a pronounced anti tumor activity in mammals and it is useful in oral and parenteral administrations over a wide range of dosages. An especially preferred subgroup within this embodiment consists of Au III L1 X1 3 complexes in which L1 represents a substituted by carboxy or C26 alkanoyl, or 2 an N C1 4 alkyl imidazole and X is chloro or bromo. Typical of the nitrogen containing ligands L1 falling with this subgroup are, for example, nicotinic acid, 3 acetylpyridine andN methylimidazole. The corresponding complexes exhibit the highest ascertained order of anti tumor activity when compared against other complexes in this series and against known analogs. It is essential for activity that the nitrogen atom of the imidazole nucleous be substituted by a lower alkyl moiety, a fact which can be demonstrated by comparing the ILS values for trichloro imidazole gold III and trichloro N methylimidazole gold III in Table 3. Thus, whereas, the former Example 9 is inactive in bringing about a regression of S 180 ascites at all doses tested, the latter compound Example 4 is decidedly active within the 20 40 mg kg range. PREPARATIVE METHOD The products of this invention may be obtained by treating equimolar amounts of alkali metal tetrahaloaurate with the appropriate amine L . The precipitate which forms is filtered from solution and it may be washed with water to afford a purified product EMI6.1 wherein Au represents gold in the trivalent state, L is an aliphatic amine, an aromatic amine or a heterocyclic amine of the type hereinbefore described and X is chloro or bromo. The reaction is preferably conducted with stirring at temperatures below about 250C and, most preferably, at temperatures of about This process is conducted in an aqueous solution such as water but other media as, for example, an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol also may be employed. Certain of the products, for example, the Au nicotinic acid X3 and Au pyridylacetic acid X3 of Examples 1, 4, 10 and 11 are soluble in 1 sodium bicarbonate solution to the extent of 12.8 mg ml. The infrared spectral data shows intense AuCl bands at 1 approximately 350 cm 1 for all analyzed complexes and this is consistent with the assigned structure for the products. Gold content was determined by the gravimetric method described by F. E. Beamish in The Analytical Chemistry of theNoble Metals Pergamon Press, Oxford, page 321 1966 . PHARMACOLOGY The products of this invention are useful in the treatment of tumors in animals as, for example, Sarcoma 180 ascites tumors in mammals such as mice. This anti tumor effect also may extend to other sarcomas and to such other tumors as the following lymphoid leukemia, lymphosarcoma, myelocytic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, scirrhous carcinoma, malignant melanoma, seminoma, teratoma, choriocarcinoma, embryonalcarcinoma, cystadenocarcinoma, endometroidcarcinoma or neuroblastoma and the like.In addition, said complexes may be useful as anti viral, anti inflammatory, anti bacterial and anti parasitic agents. They may be administered parenterally or orally in admixture with a non toxic pharmacologically acceptable inert carrier or diluent in any of the usual pharmaceutical forms.These include solid and liquid oral unit dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, powders and suspensions or solutions and suspensions for subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intra arterial injection. The term unit dosage refers to physically discrete units which may be administered in single or multiple dosages each containing a predetermined quantity of the active ingredient in association with the required diluent, carrier or vehicle. The quantity of active ingredient is the amount of the complex which is needed to produce the desired therapeutic effect. A typical unit dosage consists essentially of from about 5 250 mg. of active ingredient however, the form in which said ingredient is administered and the frequency of administration is usually determinative of the concentration. Thus, for example, oral unit dosage forms containing 5 250 mg. of active ingredient may be administered one or more times per day depending upon the severity of the tumor which is sought to be treated and the condition of the host animal. By contrast, parenteral administration generally requires from about 10 125 mg. of the active ingredient per unit dosage administered as a daily dose or as a fraction thereof depending upon whether the regimen calls for administration once, twice, three or four times daily. By contrast to the unit dosage , the effective dose is that dosage which is needed to achieve the desired anti tumor effect. In general, this dosage lies within the range of from about 2 480 mg. of the active ingredient per kg. of body weight of the host animal. A preferred concentration lies within the range of from about 5 250 mg. kg. of body weight. For oral administration it has been found that an effective dose of 8 480 mg. kg. is most suitable, whereas, in the case of parenteral administration it is usually advisable to employ from lethal dose and they may be varied over a wide range for adjustment to the patient which is being treated. In this invention the term pharmacologically acceptable inert carrier or diluent denotes a non toxic substance which, when mixed with the active ingredient, renders it more suitable for administration. Compositions intended for oral administration may include such carriers or diluents as corn starch, potato starch, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, powdered gum tragacanth, gelatin, alginic acid, agar, stearic acid or the sodium, calcium and magnesium salts of stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and dicalcium phosphate. Said compositions may also contain non toxic adjuvants and modifiers such as dyes, buffering agents, preservatives, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavoring agents or biocides and the like. Tablets are prepared by mixing a complex of this invention in a suitably comminuted or powdered form with a diluent or base such as starch, kaolin, dicalcium phosphate and the like.The resulting mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as a syrup, starch paste , acacia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials, whereafter, the wetted mixture is forced through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powdered mixture can be run through a tablet machine and imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules are lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies via the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil and the lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The complexes can also be combined with free flowing inert carriers followed by or slugging steps. A protective coating or sealing coat of shellac, sugar or polymeric material and a polished coating of wax can also be provided. Dyestuffs may be added to distinguish different unit dosages. Capsules are formulated by preparing a powdered mixture, according to the procedure hereinbefore described and pouring said mixture into preformed gelatin sheaths. A lubricant such as talc, magnesium stearate or calcium stearate can be added as an adjuvant prior to the filling operation. A glidant such as colloidal silica may be added to improve the flow characteristics and a disintegrating or solubilizing agent may also be added to enhance the effectiveness of the medicament upon ingestion. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical diluent or carrier such as an edible carbohydrate as, for example, starch. Sweetening agents and flavorings, preservatives and dispersing aAd or coloring agents may also be employed. Oral fluids such as syrups and elixirs are prepared in unit dosage form so that a given quantity of medicament, such as a teaspoonful, will contain a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the active ingredient in a non toxic vehicle in which it is essentially insoluble. Fluid unit dosage forms for parenteral administration can be prepared by placing a measured amount of the complex in an ampoule or vial which is sterilized and sealed. An accompanying vial or vehicle can be provided for mixing with said complex prior to administration. This invention also provides for combining two or more of the subject complexes into a single unit dosage form or, alternatively, combining one or more of said complexes with other known anti tumor agents, therapeutic agents or nutritive agents and the like so as to enhance or complement the antitumor effect. The preferred compositions for oral administration are tablets in which the gold complex is present in quantities of 5 250 mg. but, preferably, 20 100 mg. in a pharmaceutically acceptable orally ingestible solid carrier. If desired, the composition may also contain flavors, binders, lubricants and other excipients known in the art. A preferred alternative for oral administration is the soft gelatin capsule. Such a composition may contain from 5 250 mg. but, preferably, 20 100 mg. by weight of active ingredient dissolved or suspended in vegetable oil, peanut oil, alcohol or glycerine and the like. The following embodiments illustrate representative unit dosage forms. compressed Tablet A tablet suitable for swallowing is prepared by mixing the following ingredients Trichloro Nicotinic Acid gold III 50 mg. Niacinamide 50 mg. Calcium Pantothenate 40 mg. Magnesium Sulfate 50 mg. Zinc Sulfate 50 mg. Magnesium Stearate 10 mg. 230 mg.The trichloro nicotinic acid gold III , niacinamide, calcium stearate 5.0 mg. are mixed and compressed into slugs. The slugs are then broken into granules and sifted through an 8 mesh screen Additional magnesium stearate 5.0 mg. is added and the mixture is then compressed into tablets suitable for oral administration. Soft Gelatin Capsule A soft elastic gelatin capsule is filled with the following ingredients Trichloro 3 Acetylpyridine gold III 100 mg. Wheat germ oil 50 mg. Sunflower seed oil 100 mg. 250 mg. The trichloro 3 acetylpyridine gold III and wheat germ oil are mixed with sunflower seed oil and the resulting mixture is poured into gelatin capsules suitable for oral administration. An alternative embodiment provides for substituting sunflower seed oil and wheat germ oil with equal amounts of peanut oil to obtain an otherwise similar capsule which is also suitable for oral administration. Dry Filled Capsule A hard dry filled capsule may be prepared from the following ingredients Trichloro Nicotinic Acid gold III 75 mg. Niacinamide 50 mg. Calcium Pantothenate 10 mg. 135 mg. The trichloro nicotinic acid gold III is reduced to a No.60 powder. Niacinamide and calcium pantothenate are passed through a No. 60 bolting cloth and the ingredients are added to the trichloro nicotinic acid gold III . This combination of ingredients is mixed for 10 minutes and then poured into a No.3 size gelatin capsule. Dry Powder The following composition illustrates a representative dosage in dry powder form. In this embodiment the active ingredient is combined with up to 60 by weight of a suitable flavoring agent. All quantities are in a weight percent relationship. Trichloro N Methylimidazole gold III 25 90 Flavoring Agent 10 60 Preservative 0 1.0 The trichloro N methylimidazole gold III , flavoring agent and preservative are thoroughly blended to afford a homogeneous dry powder. The resulting formulation may be blended with other therapeutic agents to afford combination type medicinals.Alternatively, said powder may be dissolved in a pharmacologically acceptable diluent to afford a solution which is suitable for oral administration. Compositions intended for parenteral administration may include such diluents and carriers as water miscible solvents as, for example, sesame oil, groundnut oil and aqueous propylene glycol. Typical of said compositions are solutions which contain the active ingredient in sterile form. An embodiment illustrating a dosage form suitable for intravenous injection is set forth below. Parenteral Solution Injectable solutions can be formulated by mixing an ampoule of active ingredient with an ampoule of sterile diluent Ampoule Trichloro Nicotinic Acid gold III 100 mg. The trichloro nicotinic acid gold III and aqueous NaHCO5 are mixed thoroughly immediately prior to administration. If desired, one or more other active ingredients may be added to provide an injectable solution having enhanced therapeutic activity.

In said claims the ligands which embrace ammonia, quinoline and isoquinoline are identified as L21,. ANTI TUMOR EVALUATION The above prepared compounds were evaluated against 5180 ascites in female CFW Swiss mice. The mice were weighed average weight 20 g , placed into cages six mice to a cage and on day zero the mice were inoculated with 0.2 ml of a freshly prepared saline suspension 0.15 M NaCl containing 1 x 10 tumor cells ml or a total of 2 x 106 cells. This inoculum was freshly prepared using transfer mice which had been injected with tumor cells the previous week it was obtained via the following steps 1 the removal of cells from the peritoneal cavity of the sacrificed transfer mouse, 2 alternate centrifugation and washing operations 2 3 times with cold saline to remove blood and other components, and 3 dilution of the volume of the packed cell with saline 1 3 .A final centrifugation was carried out at 1000 RPM over a two minute period. A cell count was made on a 2,000 fold dilution of this 1 3 suspension by means of a Coulter Counter. A final dilution to 1 x 107 cells ml was made based on the average count. On day 1, solutions of the test compounds were prepared and each mouse in a set of six were injected with the same test compound at the same dosage. The doses were based on the average weight of the animals cage weight . Also, beginning on day 1 two controls were employed containing six mice per control Normal Control This consisted solely of the carrier or diluent used in combination with the test compound and 2 Positive Control This consisted solely of the known anti tumor agent cis Pt NH3 2C12 Cisplatin in saline 8 mg kg to test the response of the biological system The effectiveness of a test compound was measured in terms of the increase in life span ILS of the test mice relative to the Normal Control Calculated from the day of tumor inoculation, lie., day zero . To standardize the test data and permit intercomparisons, the day of evaluation was arbitrarily taken as that day corresponding to twice the mean life span or average day of death of the control. This established a practical upper limit of 100 on the ILS attainable. For calculation purposes the survivors on the day of evaluation were considered to have died on that day.The ILS was calculated as follows EMI19.1 tb ILS SEP mean life SEP span SEP of SEP test SEP mice SEP 1 SEP SEP x SEP 100 SEP tb SEP span SEP of SEP span SEP span SEP or SEP control SEP mice SEP 1 tb ILS values in excess of 50 were interpreted as being indicative of anti tumor activity, whereas, values in excess of 75 indicated excellent activity. The products of Examples 1, 4, 10 and 11 were administered in a freshly prepared 1 sodium bicarbonate solution the remaining test compounds were administered as slurries in 0.5 Klucel hydroxypropylcellulose . All products I are insoluble in water. The results of this study are summarized inTable 4.

All of the test compounds exhibited indices which exceed the 1.0 threshold limit. The trichloro nicotinic acid gold III of Example 1 and the trichloro 3 acetylpyridine gold III of Example 3 afforded indices of 5.8 and 4.5 respectively, figures which compare favorably with the 2.2 2.5 value attributed to commercially available Cisplatin. On the basis of the foregoing the complexes of this invention have been determined to be effective anti tumor agents however, the products herein described are merely illustrative of the invention and it is to be understood that effect. Accordingly, any derivatives of the herein described compounds which prove useful in the treatment of tumors are to be considered as being within the scope of this invention.
