# Plasma deposition method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A plasma deposition apparatus comprising a plasma formation chamber 1 into which a gas is introduced to pro duce plasma, a specimen chamber 2 in which a specimen table 8 is disposed for placing thereon a specimen substrate 7 on which a thin film is to be formed, a plasma extraction window 5 interposed between the plasma formation cham ber 1 and the specimen chamber 2 , a target 16, 41 which is made of a sputtering material and is interposed between the plasma extraction window 5 and the specimen table 8 , a first means 19 for extracting ions for sputtering the target 16, 41 from a plasma stream 6 extracted from the plasma formation chamber 1 to impinge against the target 16, 41 , and a second means 10 for extracting the plasma stream 6 through the plasma extraction window 5 into the specimen chamber 2 and for transporting the sputtered and ionized atoms to the specimen substrate 7 placed on the specimen table 8 . A high quality thin film of various metals and metal compounds can be formed at a low temperature and a thin film is formed, while characteristics or properties of the thin film to be formed is controlled.
