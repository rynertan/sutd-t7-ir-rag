# RF Watt meter.

## Abstract
An RF wattmeter is disclosed of the type using an insertion type pick up element to produce a voltage wave signal corresponding to the measured power in the coaxial transmission line 11 . The induction loop 21 in the pick up element is connected to a principal detector 25 , and a secondary detector 30 is connected in opposition to the principal detector 25 . Both detectors are located in close proximity to each other and are subject to the same diode thermal environment. A sine wave generator supplies a wave signal to the secondary detector in opposition to the wave signal supplied to the principal detector from the inductive loop 21 . The d.c. portion of the resulting signal representing the difference between the opposed signals is integrated 40 , and the integrated output is used as the amplitude in the generated sine wave 32 . When the circuit is in balance, the integrated output matches the amplitude of the inductive wave form and can be used as an output indicating 43 measured power in the coaxial transmission line 11 .
