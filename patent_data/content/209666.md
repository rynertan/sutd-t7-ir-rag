# Angular position adjusting means.

## Abstract
An angular position adjusting device comprises a planetary gear mechanism intervenes between a fixed member and a movable member rotatably arranged relative to said fixed member in such a way that the relative gear en gagement position between an inner gear and an outer gear of said planetary gear mechanism is changeable when any one of the inner gear and outer gear is eccentrically rotated by an eccentrically rotatable member said planetary gear mechanism is in engagement with one of said fixed member and said movable member and torque limiting coupling means intervenes between said planetary gear mechanism and the other of said fixed member and said movable member. A driving means like motor for rotating the eccentrically rotatable member may be mounted on any one of the mov able and fixed members. With a compact size a high gear re duction ratio and a high shock damping are realized.
