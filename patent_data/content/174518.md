# Zero cross point detecting circuit.

## Abstract
For the purpose of detection of a zero cross point of an input signal, the input is applied to one of two input terminals of a comparator 49 , which has an inverted input terminal and a non inverted input terminal , the same bias voltage is applied to each of two input terminals of the comparator 49 from a bias voltage supplying circuit 48 , the value of the bias voltage applied to either the inverted input terminal or the non inverted input terminal of the comparator 49 is changed by a bias voltage changing circuit 51 from that determined by the bias voltage supplying circuit 48 depending on whether the output of the comparator 49 is in its high or lower level, wherein the output of the comparator 49 is a detection signal of the zero cross point of the input signal.
