# Preparation of the human von Willebrand factor by recombinant DNA.

## Abstract
Full length human von Willebrand factor vWF cDNA was assembled from partial, overlapping vWF cDNAs. This cDNA construct includes an open reading frame of 2,813 amino acid residues, apparently representing a pre pro sequence of 763 and mature vWF of 2,050 amino acids. Both the pro sequence and mature vWF harbor an arg gly asp R G D sequence which has been implicated in cell attachment functions. It is assumed that the pro sequence is equivalent to von Willebrand Antigen II vW AgII . The glyco proteins prepared by cultivation of microorganisms or other hosts like animal or human cells containing a plasmide or phage with said cDNA coding may be used in pharmaceutical compositions intended for administration to patients with the von Willebrand s disease.

## Description
cDNA coding for the human von Willebrand factor, plas µµX s with such a cDNA coding or fragments thereof respectively, microorganisms and animal or human cells which contain such plasmids or phages, preparation of proteins by the cultivation of the above mentioned hosts, the obtained proteins and pharmaceutical compositions containing a biologically active form of the obtained proteins. The von Willebrand factor vWF is a large, multimeric plasma protein, composed of an apparently, single glycoprotein with a molecular weight MW of about 225 kI . These subunits are linked together by disulfide bonds. In plasma vWF circulates as multimers, ranging from dimers to multimers of more than 50 subunits. Dimers consist of two subunits joined, probably at their C termini, by flexible rod shaped domains and are presumed to be the protomers in multimerization. The protomers are linked through large, probably N terminal, globular domains to form multimers. vWF is synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. It is believed that this protein is initially produced as a 260 kD glycosylated precursor that is subsequently subjected to carbohydrate processing, sulfatation, dimerization, multimerization and to proteolytic cleavage to yield the mature 225 kD subunit Sporn,L.A., et al. 1985 Biosynthesis of vWF protein in human megakaryo cytes, J. Clin. Invest. 76, 1102 1106 Wagner, D.D., et al. 1984 J. of Cell Biology 99, 2123 2130 . It has been shown that vWF is stored in the Weibel Palade bodies within the endothelial cells. It can not be excluded that these organelles play a role in the processing of the precursor protein. vWF participates in critical steps in hemostasis. It is involved in platelet vessel wall interactions after vascular injury, leading to platelet plug formation. On the vWF protein domains have been assigned which show specific interaction with the platelet glycoproteins IB Jenkins, C.S.P., et al. 1976 J. Clin. Invest.69, 1212 1222 , IIB IIIA Fujimoto, T., et al. 1982 Adenomie diphosphate induces binding of von Willebrand factor to human platelets, Nature 297, 154 156 , collagens type I and III and with another, yet unidentified, component in the subendoshe .g aSe assignments are based on studies with monoclonal anti vWF antibodies which are able to inhibit a particular interaction of vWF.For a in depth analysis of structure function relationships of the vWF protein, a full length vWF cDNA will be indispensable. Introduction of well defined mutations within this cDNA and expression of the mutated cDNA in a suitable host will allow a detailed localization of functional domains within the vWF protein. Recently, applicants and others Lynch, D.C., et al. 1985 Cell 41, 49 56 Ginsburg, M., et al. 1985 J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3931 3936 Verweij,C.L., et al. 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4699 4717, based onDutch patent application 85.00961 Sadler, J.E., et al. 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 have cloned partial vWF cDNA sequences.The presence of a short 3 untranslated region 136 nt on vWF ntNA, which extends to about 9,000 nt, led us to assume that the precursor protein for vWF has a MW considerable larger than the reported 260 kD Wagner, D.D., et al. 1984 J. of CellBiology 99, 2123 2130 . A full length vWF cDNA will enable us to elucidate the enigma on the MW of the precursor, characterize its processing pathway and establish the primary structure. This invention relates to the isolation and the nucleotide sequence of cDNAs, spanning the entire vWF mRNA, and on the assembly of these sequences into a full length, functional vWF cDNA. Further this invention relates to plasmides and phages containing above indicated vWF cDNAs as well as to the microorganisms like bacteria and fungi as well as animal or human cells containing said plasmids or phages. Moreover the proteins prepared by cultivating above indicated hosts and the pharmaceutical compositions containing a biologically active form of the obtained proteins do also fall within the scope of the present invention. In this respect it is emphasized that by means of such pharmaceutical compositions it is possible to circumvent the safety problems bound to the administration of vWF protein recovered from blood samples of normal individuals. To perform the investigations forming the basis of the invention, use has been made of the materials and method below. MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA cloning Total RNA was purified from in vitro cultured endothelial cells, derivated from veins of human umbilical cords Verweij,C.L., et al. 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4699 4717, based onDutch patent application 85.00961 . Primer directed cDNA was synthesized essentially according to a protocol described Gubler, U., et al. 1983 Gene 25, 263 269 Toole, J.J., et al. 1985 Nature 312, 342 347 . The cDNA synthesis was arrested by adding EDTA and SDS till a final concentration of, respectively, 20 mM and 0.1 . The cDNA preparations were extracted with phenolchloroform, then precipitated with ethanol and purified by chromatography on Sephadex G 50. In the case of primer directed cDNA synthesis with primer A 5 CACAGGCCACACGTGGGAGC 3 , complementary to nucleotides 6901 till 6921, the cDNA preparation was digested with BglII positions 6836 and 2141 and KpnI position 4748 . Subsequently, the digested cDNA was size fractionated by chromatography on a Sepharose CL 4B column. Fractions containing cDNA larger than about 600 bp were ligated to plasmid pMBL1l, digested.with BglII and KpnI. A cDNA library of about 15,000 independent colonies was established, using strain E.coli DH1 as a host, which was screened with two oligonucleotide probes B and C . Probe B 5 GAGGCAGGATTTCCGGTGAC 3 , complementary to nucleotides 4819 till 4839 was employed for the isolation of the plasmid pvWF2084, harboring a 2,084 bp BglII KpnI vWF cDNA fragment, while probe C 5 CAGGGACACCTTTCCAGGGC 3 , complementary to 2467 till 2487, was used for the detection of plasmid pvWF2600, harboring an approximately 2,600 bp KpnI BglII vWF cDNA fragment. Using probe C for primer directed synthesis applicants divided the resulting cDNA preparation in two parts. One part was C tailed and annealed to G tailed plasmid pUC9 as described before Verweij,C.L., et al. 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4699 4717, based onDutch patent application 85.00961 and used to transform E.coli DH1. Six thousand independent colonies were hybridized with a nick translated 575 bp BglII BawHI vWF cDNA fragment of pvWF2600 DNA. A positive clone, harboring a plasmid with the longest insert about 1,800 bp, designated pvWF1800 was chosen for further study.The other part of the primer C directed cDNA preparation was treated with EcoRI methylase and subsequently with T4 DNA polymerase and dTTPs to ensure blunt ended termini Maniatis, T., et al. 1982 Molecular Cloning Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory . Phosphorylated EcoRI linkers New England Biolabs, Beverly,MA were ligated to the termini of the cDNA preparation and unreacted components were removed by Sephadex G 50 chromatography.The XhoI site, located about 350 bp downstream of the 5 end of the VWF cDNA insert of pvWF1800 DNA, was used for another selection.After digestion with an excess of EcoRI and XhoI chromatography onSepharose CL 4B was employed to remove digested EcoRI linkers. The final preparation was ligated to plasmid pMBL1l DNA which had been digested with EcoRI plus XhoI and used to transform E.coli DE1. A collection of about 10,000 independent colonies was hybridized with a nick translated 350 bp XhoI HindIII vWF cDNA fragment from plasmid pvWF1800. The HindIII site of this fragment has been derived from the polylinker of the vector pUC9. A positive clone, harboring the longest insert about 1,330 bp, designated pvWF1330 was further studied. Sl nuclease protection analysis Applicants used a probe for S1 nuclease protection experiments an XhoI EcoRI fragment of about 5,300 bp probe V from plasmid pvWF2600 which contains a 2,390 bp segment XhoI KpnI constituted of vWF cDNA Fragment V, Figure 1 . Probe II was a 4,800 bp XbaIEcoRI fragment from plasmid pvWF1330 which harbors a 735 bp XbaIXhoI vWF cDNA segment Fragment II, Figure 1 . The fragments were 3 end labelled, using DNA polymerase I large fragment NewEngland Biolabs, Beverly, MA to fill in recessed ends Maniatis,T., et al. 1982 Molecular Cloning Laboratory Manual, Cold SpringHarbor Laboratory . Subsequently, these probes were isolated by electrophoresis on a 0.7 Z low melting agarose gel and purified as described Wieslander, L. 1979 Anal. Biochem. 48, 305 309 . Three other WF cDNA fragments were subcloned in double stranded M13mp18 and employed as probes. To that end the anti senseDNA strand was uniformily labelled by elongation from the universalML3 primer with DNA polymerase I large fragment . The subcloned fragments were a 1,144 bp Thol HindIII fragment of plasmid pvWF1800 Fragment III, Figure 1 , a 585 bp XbaI EcoRI fragment of plasmid pvWF1330 Fragment I, Figure 1 and a 575 bp BamHI BglII fragment of plasmid pvWF2600 Fragment IV, Figure 1 . After DNA synthesis, initiated at the M13 primer, double stranded DNA was digested with both HindIII and PvuII for fragment III to yield probeII , with both XbaI and EcoRI for fragment I to yield probe I and with both BamHI and PvuII for fragment IV to yield probe IV .The rationale for the construction of probes II, III, IV and V is that they contain a segment of vector DNA non complementary with endothelial RNA. For example probes III and IV harbor about 200 bp, derived from M13mp18. These probes were subjected to electrophoresis on a 5 polyacrylamide 8M urea gel and the fragments of interest were isolated Maxam A.G., et al. 1980 Methods Enzymol.65, 499 560 . S1 nuclease protection experiments were carried out essentially as described Berk, A.J., et al. 1977 Cell 12, 721 732 . One microgram of human endothelial polyA RNA was added to 10,000 100,000 counts per min. of radiolabelled probe, heated for 10 min.at 800 C, followed by an incubation overnight at 600C for probes I,II, III and V and at 570C for probe IV. Digestion with 200 Units ofS1 nuclease Bethesda Research Lab., Gaithersburg, Md. per ml for 20 min. at 450C. Undigested DNA was precipitated with ethanol and the pellets were dissolved in the appropriate loading buffer for electrophoresis on a 0.8 alkaline agarose gel or on a 6 polyacrylamide sequencing gel Maniatis, T., et al. 1982 MolecularCloning Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory . The first procdedure was employed for probes I and III, whereas the second one was applied for probes II, IV and V.Assembly of full length vWF cDNA For the construction of plasmid pSP6330vWF, harboring a continuous vWF cDNA segment of about 6,331 bp extending from theHindIII site position 2235 till the SacI site within the 3 untranslated region position 8562 the following vWF cDNA fragments were isolated the 2,517 bp HindIII KpnI fragment position 2236 till 4753 from pvWF2600 DNA, the 2,084 bp KpnI BglII fragment position 4753 till 6837 from pvWF2084 DNA and the 1,730 bp BglII SacI fragment position 6837 till 8567 from pvWF2280 DNA. These three vWF cDNA fragments were ligated simultaneously into the vector pSP64 Melton, D.A., et al. 1984 Nucl. Acids Research 12, 7035 7056 , digested with both HindIII and SacI.About half of the resulting transformants contained a plasmid denoted pSP6330vWF with the desired vWF cDNA insert of about 6,331 bp, as verified by restriction enzyme analysis. For the construction of plasmid pSP8800vWF, harboring full length vWF cDNA, the following fragments were isolated the 6,330 bp HindIII EcoRI insert of plasmid pSP6330vWF the EcoRI site is derived from the polylinker present on the vector , the 1,044 bpXhoI HindIII fragment position 1092 till 2236 from pvWF1800 and the 1,327 bp EcoRI XhoI fragment position 236 till 1092 from pvWF1330. A five fold molar excess of each of these three fragments were again ligated simultaneously with vector pSP65 DNA, cleaved with EcoRI and treated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase Boehringer, Mannheim, BRD . About 30 of the resulting colonies harbored a plasmid with the desired, full length vWF cDNA insert of about 8,795 bp, as verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequence analysis.In vitro transcription and translation In vitro transcription of linear SP6 based DNA templates withSP6 RNA polymerase New England Nuclear, Dreieich, BRD was performed in the presence of 0.1 mM UTP, CTP and ATP, 0.05 mM GTP and 2 mM of m7G 5 ppp 5 G Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden to provide mRNA preparations with a capped terminus Melton, D.A., et al. 1984 Nucl. Acids Research 12, 7035 7056 . In vitro translation of such 5 capped mRNAs was done in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system New England Nuclear, Dreieich, Bred , according to the manufacturer s specifications. Analysis of the in vitro translation products was performed by electrophoresis on a 8 z SDS polyacrylamide gel as described Laemmli, U.K. 1970 Nature 227, 650 655 .RESULTSConstruction of partial vWF cDNA clones and assembly of full length vWF cDNA Previously, applicants and others have reported on the con struction of plasmids containing part of a full length human vWF cDNA Verweij, C.L., et al. 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 46994717, based on Dutch patent application 85.00961 Lynch, D.C., et al. 1985 Cell 41, 49 56 Ginsburg, M., et al. 1985 J. Biol.Chem. 260, 3931 3936 Sadler, J.E., et al. 1985 Proc. Nucl. Acad.Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 . The most extended vWF cDNA, that applicants obtained from an oligo dT primed human endothelial cDNA library, comprised about 2,280 bp pvWF2280 . Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that this cDNA insert has been initiated at the polyA tail of vWF mRNA. To construct a full length vWF cDNA, applicants have isolated additional, overlapping vWF cDNA sequences which are located upstream of pvWF2280. For that purpose two biochemical selections were employed to enrich for the number of vWF cDNA harboring plasmids. First, oligonucleotide primers, derived from the partial nucleotide sequence Sadler, J.E., et al. 1985 Proc. Nuci. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 , were synthesized to direct cDNA synthesis with human endothelial polyA RNA as substrate. Second, cDNA preparations were digested with particular restriction endonucleases, known to dissect vWF cDNA at a limited number of sites Ginsburg, M., et al. 1985 J. Biol. Chem. 260, 393i 3936 Sadler, J.E., et al. 1985 Proc. Nucl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 . These restriction sites can subsequently be employed to assemble a full length vWF cDNA. The cloning strategy is outlined in Figure 1A. The plasmids, containing adjacent vWF cDNA sequences, were designated pvWF1330, pvWF1800, pvWF2600, pvWF2084 and pvWF2280. The nucleotide sequence of the 5 part of pvWF1330 DNA corresponding with the 5 end of vWF mRNA revealed that nonsense codons were present in all three reading frames.From this finding applicants conclude that pvWF1330 DNA extends beyond the translation initiation codon. S1 nuclease protection experiments with human endothelial RNA were performed to proof that the various vWF cDNA inserts are fully complementary to vWF mRNA. The construction of the probes and the conditions used are described in the section Materials and methods.The results are shown in Figure 2. In all cases the length of the protected fragments is in accord with the predicted length of the different probes. From these data applicants conclude that the vWF cDNA inserts of, respectively, pvWF1330, pvWF1800 and pvWF2600 DNA are entirely complementary with vWF mRNA. The nucleotide sequence of the remaining cDNA inserts of plasmids pvWF2084 and pvWF2280 were shown before to correspond with the published sequence Sadler, J.E., et al. 1985 Proc. Nucl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 . Consequently, the different, adjacent vWF cDNA sequences are genuine copies of vWF IONA. The vWF cDNA sequences that applicants have constructed span a length of about 8,900 bp. This length is consistent with the size of vWF mRNA, determined by Northern blot analysis of human endothelial polyA RNA Verweij, C.L., et al. 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4699 4717, based on Dutch patent application 85.00961 .A detailed description of the assembly of full length vWF cDNA is given in the section Materials and methods. The correct composition of the assembled, full length vWF cDNA was established by restriction enzyme analysis.Nucleotide sequence of full length vWF cDNA Nucleotide sequence analysis of vWF cDNA fragments was carried out both by the chemical degradation method Maxam, A.M. et al., 1977 and by the dideoxy chain termination procedure Sanger, F., et al. 1977 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 5463 5467 , according to the scheme outlined in Figure 1A. In Figure 3 the nucleotide sequence of about 8806 residues, extending from the 5 end of vWF mRNA, and the corresponding predicted amino acid sequence are presented. The remaining nucleotide sequence of the 3 part of vWF mRNA has been reported before Sadler, J.E. et al., 1985 Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci USA 82, 6394 6398 Verweij, C.L. et al., 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4699 4717, based on Dutch patent application 85.00961 . In general the overlapping part of our nucleotide sequence of vwF cDNA with that of Sadler, J.E. et al., 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 reveals no differences. However, the first 12 nucleotides corresponding with position 2217 till 2229 at the 5 terminus of vWF cDNA on phage lambda HvWF1, constructed by those authors, are completely divergent from our sequence which has been established on three independent, overlapping cDNA inserts. Another discrepancy was observed at position 2309. Our analysis reveals a C residue, whereas Sadler, J.E. et al., 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad Sci.USA 82, 6394 6398 report an A residue, resulting in, respectively, a proline and a histidine at that particular position. This difference might be due to a polymorphism in the vWF gene, although the proline residue has been established independently by automated amino acid sequence analysis of the mature vWF protein Hessel, B.et al., 1984 Thrombosis Research 35, 637 651 . The total length spanned by the adjacent vWF cDNA sequences is 8,814 bp, excluding the polyA tail of vWF mRNA. The translation initiation site was assigned to the ATG codon indicated position 1 till 4 , being the first initiator codon downstream of the TAG nonsense codon position 79 till 82 , which is followed by an open translation reading frame of 8,439 nucleotides deduced from our sequence data and those of Sadler, J.E. et al., 1985 Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 . This assignment is supported by the observation that the predicted 22 N terminal amino acid residues displays the characteristic features of a signal peptide.The cleavage site for a signal peptidase with the highest probability is located between the glycine and alanine residues, respectively, at position 22 and 23 Von Heijne, 1983 Eur. J.Biochem. 133, 17 21 . The proposed translation initiation codon is preceded by an untranslated region of at least 230 nt. A continuous vWF cDNA coding sequence of 8,439 bp potentially programs the synthesis of a polypeptide of 2,813 amino acid residues, with a calculated MW of 309 kD. To applicants knowledge this represents the longest coding sequence determined to date. A computer aided search for partial homologous amino acid sequences with other proteins, contained within the NIH Protein Sequence DataBank, did not reveal any major similarity with other proteins.Furthermore, it has been reported that mature vWF protein is a glycoprotein, containing approximately 15 carbohydrate residues Sodetz, J.M. et al., 1979 J. Biol. Chem. 254, 10754 10760 . If, it is assumed that the carbohydrate moieties also contribute about 15 by weight to calculated molecular weight of pro vWF then the molecular weight of pro vWF will amount to approximately 350 kD. Peculiarities of the amino acid sequence of Pre vWF A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence Figure 3 with the established N terminal amino acid sequence of mature vWF protein Hessel, B. et al., 1984 Thrombosis Research 35, 637 651 confirms our earlier assumption Verweij, C.L. et al., 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4699 4717, based on Dutch patent application 85.00961 that the vWF precursor protein is considerably larger than the reported 260 kD glycoprotein Wagner, D.D. et al., 1983 J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2065 2067 .Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequence with the N terminal sequence of the mature 225 M vWF protein shows that the nucleotide sequence which codes for mature vWF protein initiates at position 2290. This conclusion implicates that the vWF precursor protein is 763 amino acid residues larger than the mature protein. Obviously, this prosequence calculated MW 81 kD is removed by protein processing to yield the mature vWF glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about 225 kD. A homology matrix comparison of the amino acid sequence of the vWF precursor protein reveals a quadruplication of a domain D1, D2, D3, D4 with a length of about 350 amino acid residues. Part of this domain D , about 96 amino acids appears to be present at theN terminus of mature WF. Figure 4A shows the alignment of these repetitive domains. A salient feature of the pro sequence is that it largely consists of a duplication of the D domain D1, D2 . The repeats exhibit a significant conservation of the position of cysteine residues, indicative for a structural similarity of the repeats. Interestingly, the pro sequence comprises an arginine glycine aspartic acid sequence RGD sequence at position 698 till 702.It has been shown that a tetrapeptide with the indicated amino acid sequence can compete with proteins, harboring a similar sequence, which are involved in cell attachment Pierschbacher,M.D. et al., 1984 Nature 309, 30 33 . It has been noticed that another RGD sequence is present within the C terminal part of the mature vWF protein Sadler, J.E. et al., 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 82, 6394 6398 . In vitro translation of vWF mRNA A full length vWF cDNA was assembled in order to demonstrate its coding capacity for a unglycosylated precursor protein with aMW of about 300 kD. Full length vWF cDNA was inserted into plasmid pSP65. This plasmid contains the S. typhimurium bacteriophage SP6 promotor which allows in vitro run off transcription of clonedDNA sequences, specifically directed by SP6 RNA polymerase Melton,D.A. et al., 1984 Nucl. Acids Research 12, 7035 7056 . Such mRNA preparations can be efficiently translated, using a reticulocyte lysate. Initially, plasmid pSP6330vWF Figure 1B was constructed, harboring a continuous, 6,331 bp vWF cDNA sequence. This plasmid contains the entire coding sequence for mature vWF and in addition a sequence coding for 18 amino acid residues from the C terminal part of the pro sequence. Initiation of protein synthesis, directed by RNA transcribed from pSP6330vWF DNA, should occur at the methionine codon 8 amino acids downstream of the N terminus of mature vWF. Translation of the in vitro synthesized vWF mRNA will then yield an unglycosylated polypeptide with a calculated MW of 220 kD. Subsequently, pSP8800vWF Figure 1B was constructed harboring the complete coding sequence for pre vWF.This plasmid will encode a protein with a calculated MW of 309,250 D. The plasmids pSP6330vWF and pSP8800vWF were linearized with, respectively, EcoRI and SalI and transcribed in vitro. Thevresults of the in vitro translation of the various vWF mRNAs are given in Figure 5. The polypeptides encoded by pSP6330vWF DNA display a MW of about 200 kD. The discrepancy of this MW with the calculated MW 220 kD is probably due to inaccuracy in the MW estimation of large proteins in these gels. The complete coding sequence of pSP 8800vWF DNA is translated into a polypeptide with a MW substantially larger than 200 kD.To achieve a more accurate MW estimation for this extraordinarily long polypeptide, we produced partial, overlapping polypeptides derived from selected portions of full length vWF cDNA. To that end pSP8800vWF DNA was digested with BamHI and the transcript 2855 nt long was translated. It should be noted that 405 nt at the 3 end of this transcript constitute the 5 terminus of the transcript generated from pSP6330vWF cleaved with EcoRI. Hence, an enumeration of the MWs of the polypeptides, mentioned above, should result in a MW of about 309 kD, after subtracting the common protein region.The protein, derived from the BamHI digested template, has an estimated MW of about 100 kD, while as shown before template pSP6330vWF cleaved with EcoRI yields a product of about 200 kD. Enumeration of these MWs and subtracting the common region 15 kD results in an estimated MW of 285 kD which is in accord with the calculated MW of 309,250 D. Furthermore, translation of transcripts 1320 nt , derived from pSP8800vWF DNA digested with XhoI, reveals a polypeptide with a MW of 39 kD. This result is in agreement with the assignment of the translation initiation side at position 1 till 4. From these data applicants conclude that they have constructed a full length vWF cDNA with a coding sequence of 8,439 bp which programs the synthesis of a precursor VWF protein consisting of 2,813 amino acid residues.DISCUSSION This invention provides to the construction of a plasmid containing full length vWF cDNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis this patent application Verweij, C.L. et al., 1985 Nucleic AcidsResearch 13, 4699 4717, based on Dutch patent application 85.00961 Sadler, J.E. et al., 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 63946398 revealed that the length of the assembled vWF cDNA, excluding cDNA derived from the polyA tail, amounts to 8,805 bp. This result is in agreement with the length of vWF mRNA about 9,000 nt as determined by Northern blot analysis of endothelial polyA RNA Verweij, C.L. et al., 1985 Nucleic Acids Research 13, 4699 4717, based on Dutch patent application 85.00961 . The entire coding sequence for a precursor vWF protein is 8,439 bp, corresponding to an unglycosylated polypeptide with a MW of about 309 kD. The translation initiation site for this protein could be assigned to the ATG codon at position 1 till 4 see Figure 3 . This assignment is in accord with the results of in vitro translation experiments with parts of full length vWF mRNA generated with the SP6 transcription system. The glycosylated protein, even after removal of a signal peptide, will be considerably larger than 300 kD. The MW attributed to the precursor glycoprotein for mature vWF has been reported to display a MW of 260 kD Wagner, D.D. et al., 1983 Biol. Chem. 258, 2065 2067 . The discrepancy with the MW that applicants assign to the precursor protein may be due to inaccuracy of MW estimations by SDS polyacrylamide gelectrophoresis, inherent to large glyco proteins. The sequence encoding mature vWF initiates at 2,286 bp downstream of the translation initiation codon, as inferred from an alignment of the established N terminal amino acid sequence of mature vWF Hessel, B. et al., 1984 Thrombosis Research 35, 637 651 with the predicted amino acid sequence Figure 3 . This 2,286 bp long prepro sequence was shown to be able to encode a polypeptide with a calculated MW of 83 kD.Consequently, the pro vWF protein will be processed by a pro tease to yield two distinct polypeptides. It is conceivable that the specific cleavage between the arginine and serine residues at positions 763 and 764 occurs within the Weibel Palade bodies of the endothelial cell, since in the presence of a protease inhibitor PMSF a complex can be detected within these organelles of mature vWF with another glycoprotein, designated von Willebrand Antigen II vW AgII Montgomery, R.R. and Zimmerman T.S. 1978 J.Clin.Invest.61, 1498 1507 . Several arguments can be advanced which indicate that it is likely that the pro sequence of the precursor vWF protein is identical to vW AgII.i the MW of the unglycosylated pro sequence 83 kD fits with the reported MW of the vW AgII glycoprotein of 98 kD.ii it has been demonstrated that both vWF and vW AgII are synthesized by cultured endothelial cells and that these proteins are simultaneously released upon stimulation with l desamino 8 Darginine vasopressin DDAVP McCarroll, D.R. et al, 1984 Blood 63, 532 535 . iii it has been shown using immunofluorescence techniques that both proteins are localized in the perinuclear region and in theWeibel Palade bodies McCarroll, D.R. et al. 1985 , J.Clin.Invest. 75, 1089 1095 .iv both vWF and vW AgII are present in platelets and released together after platelet activation. v the levels of vWF and vW AgII protein are linearly associated in plasma and both proteins are deficient in plasma and platelets of a patient with severe von Willebrand s disease.vi as mentioned before a complex between vWF and vW AgII can be detected in the presence of a serine protease inhibitor PMSF and not in the absence of the inhibitor.The predicted amino acid sequence of the pro sequence displays a remarkable structure. It is composed of a duplicated segment of about 350 amino acid residues long. These two segments share 37 amino acid homology. Furthermore, they exhibit a considerable conservation of similarly located cysteine residues, indicating that structural features have been maintained within these direct repeats. Two copies of this repeat within the pro sequence are also present within mature vWF, whereas part of this repeat is present at the N terminus of mature vWF. Internal homologous regions have also been reported by Sadler, J.E. et al, Proc. Natl.Acad.Sci.USA, 82, 6394 6398 1985 , two of which have been duplicated, while one is present in triplicate form fig. 4B . These repeated sequences span a length of about 1070 amino acid residues within the mature vWF protein.The repeated structures that applicants have found are independent of the ones reported by Sadler, J.E. et al. Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 82, 6394 6398 1985 . From these data applicants conclude that about 90 of the precursor vWF protein is constituted of repetitive regions, indicating that the precursor vWF gene has evolved from a series of duplicative events of at least four different regions.The pro sequence may participate in the formation of large multimers, composed of vWF dimers Wagner, D.D. and Marder, V.J. 1984,J. of Cell Biology 99, 2123 2130 Lynch, D.E. et al 1983 , TheJournal of Biological Chemistry 258, 12757 12760 . In this respect it may be relevant to note that pro VWF is extremely rich in cysteines 8.1 which are mainly located in the N and C terminal parts of the protein. The cysteine content of the pro sequence is even higher 8.6 Z . It has been shown Fowler, W.E. et al. J.Clin.Invest. 76, 1491 1500 1985 that disulfide bonds at the C termini of vWF are required to form rod shape domains, connecting two such units Multimer formation should occur by joining of these dimers, probably again by do sulfide bridges at their N termini to create globular domains. Free sulfhydryl groups off the cysteine residues in the pro sequence are probably a pre requisite for the formation of multimers. The presence of a RCD C amino acid sequence within the pro sequence may be indicative for another function of this protein. It has been shown that an RGD containing region on proteins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin carry out a crucial role in the interaction with receptors on a cell surface Pierschbacher, M.D. andRuoslahti, E. 1984 Nature 309, 30 33 Pytela,R. et al. Proc.Nat.Acad.Sci.USA 82, 5766 5770 . Those interactions aretinhibited byRGD containing peptides. Interaction of mature,.vWF. with activated platelets is also inhibited by RGD containing peptides, suggesting that this region on vWF is involved in platelet binding Ginsburg,M., 1985 J.Biol.Chem. 260,, 3931 3936 Haver stick, P.M. et al.1985, Blood . Based on the presence of an RGD sequence both in mature vWF and the pro sequence, which may be equivalent to vW AgIl, and on a striking homology and 4 structural conservation between these two proteins, applicants assume that, the pro sequence might have a similar function as the mature vWF protein in a specific interaction with partieular cel surface receptors.
