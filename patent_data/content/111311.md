## Description
The present invention relates to non radioactive carriers and a radioactive diagnostic agent. More particularly, it relates to a radioactive diagnostic agent which comprises a formyl group containing, chelating substance comprising the unit of a polyformyl compound and the unit of an amino group containing chelating compound in combination, and an amino group containing physiologically active substance and a radioactive metallic element bonded to said chelating substance, and non radioactive carriers therefor. For the purpose of a non invading nuclear medical diagnosis such as recording, dynamic study and quantitative measurement of the blood circulation system, detection of physiological abnormality or localization of abnormality by imaging, there have been widely used physiologically active substances labeled with iodine 131 In order to overcome the said drawback in the ¹³¹I labeled physiologically active substances, attempts have been made to provide radioactive diagnostic agents comprising physiologically active substances and radioactive metallic elements having more favorable physical properties than iodine 131 combined thereto. Among such attempts, there is known a labeling method wherein a physiologically active substance is treated directly with a radioactive metal salt to make a chelate compound, which may be used as a radioactive diagnostic agent. For instance, human serum albumin is treated with an aqueous solution containing technetium 99m ⁹⁹ In recent years, attention was drawn to some chelating compounds which show on one hand a strong chelate forming property to a variety of metals and have on the other hand an amino group or a carboxyl group highly reactive to various physiologically active substances, and by utilization of these characteristic features, attempts have been made to combine a radioactive metallic element and a physiologically active substance to them. Examples of those chelating compounds are diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, ethylenediamine triacetic acid, 3 oxobutyral bis N methylthiosemicarbazone carboxylic acid, deferoxamine, 3 aminomethylene 2,4 pentanedione bis thiosemicarbazone derivatives and 1 p aminoalkyl phenylpropane 1,2 dione bis N methylthiosemicarbazone derivatives. Krejcarek Biochemical Biophysical Research Comm, Vol. 77, 2, 581 585 1977 Leurg Int. J. Appl. Radiation Isotopes, Vol. 29, 687 692 1978 Japanese Patent Publn. unexamined Nos. 56 34634, 56 125317, 57 102820. Since the resulting products are stable and retain the activities of the physiologically active substances combined therein, they are suitable for the diagnostic use. However, the products combined with physiologically active substances which usually have a large molecular weight such as fibrinogen molecular weight, about 340,000 and IgG molecular weight, about 160,000 can hardly provide a sufficiently high radioactivity as necessitated for diagnosis. In order to overcome the above drawback, there can be considered to combine a physiologically active substance with many chelating compounds and combining the resulting chelating bonds with many radioactive metallic elements. While this method will assure a high radioactivity, the resulting physiologically active substance may be unfavorably denatured or its physiological activity may be undesirably decreased or lost. Besides, a physiologically active substance having a large molecular weight is preferred to administer to human beings at a smaller dose in view of its antigen property. For realization of such administration, the physiologically active substance is also desired to have a higher radioactivity. As a result of extensive study, it has now been found that the use of a formyl group containing, chelating substance comprising the unit of a polyformyl compound and the unit of an amino group containing chelating compound in combination as a carrier for a physiologically active substance and a radioactive metallic element can afford a radioactive diagnostic agent having a relatively high radioactivity per molecule without causing any deterioration or decrease of the physiological activity inherent to the physiologically active substance. According to the present invention, there is provided a non radioactive carrier which comprises 1 the unit of a polyformyl compound having at least three formyl groups per molecule, 2 at least two units of an amino group containing chelating compound bonded to the polyformyl compound with intervention of a methylenimine linkage There is also provided a radioactive diagnostic agent which comprises 1 the unit of a polyformyl compound having at least three formyl groups per molecule, 2 at least two units of an amino group containing chelating compound bonded to the polyformyl compound with intervention of a methylenimine linkage There is further provided a physiologically active substance combined non radioactive carrier comprising 1 the unit of a polyformyl compound having at least three formyl groups, 2 at least two units of an amino group containing chelating compound bonded to the polyformyl compound with intervention of a methyleimine linkage or a methylenamine linkage formed by the condensation between the formyl group in the polyformyl compound and the amino group in the chelating compound, optionally followed by reduction, and 3 at least one unit of an amino group containing physiologically active substance bonded to the polyformyl compound with intervention of a methylenimine linkage or a methylenamine linkage formed by the condensation between the formyl group in the polyformyl compound and the amino group in the physiologically active substance, optionally followed by reduction, and being useful for preparation of said radioactive diagnostic agent. The polyformyl compound 1 is required to have at least three formyl groups in the molecule and preferred to have a higher number of formyl groups. Among those formyl groups, at least two serve to combine with the corresponding number of the amino group containing chelating compound 2 , and at least one serves to combine with the corresponding number of the physiologically active substance 3 . Specific examples of the polyformyl compound 1 are polyacrolein and polymethacrolein. Preferred is polyacrolein of the formula As the amino group containing chelating compound 2 , there may be used any one which shows a strong chelate forming property to a radioactive metallic element and has an amino group capable of reacting to a formyl group in the polyformyl compound 1 under a relatively mild condition. Specific examples are deferoxamine i.e. 1 amino 6,17 dihydroxy 7,10,18,21 tetraoxo 27 N acetyl hydroxylamino 6,11,17,22 tetraazaheptaeicosane The Merck Index, 9th Ed., page 374 1976 , 3 aminomethylene 2,4 pentanedione bis thiosemicarbazone derivatives of the formula The term physiologically active substance as the constituent 3 is intended to mean any substance which shows a specific accumulability at a certain organ or tissue or a certain diseased locus or exhibits a specific behavior corresponding to a certain physiological state. Tracing of the behavior of such substance in a living body can provide informations useful for diagnosis. Physiologically active substances having an amino group capable of being condensed with a formyl group under a relatively mild condition is advantageously useful in this invention. Even when an amino group is not present, however, the substance may be used as the physiologically active substance 3 after any chemical modification so as to have an amino group or an amino group containing function. Specific examples of suitable physiologically active substances are blood proteins e.g. human serum albumin, fibrinogen , enzymes e.g. urokinase, streptokinase , hormones e.g. thyroid stimulating hormone, parathyroid hormone , immune antibodies e.g. IgG , monoclonal antibodies, antibiotics e.g. bleomycin, kanamycin , saccharides, fatty acids and amino acids. In general, this invention is favorably applicable to physiologically active substances having a molecular weight of not less than about 100,000. The term radioactive metallic element as the constituent 4 is intended to mean any metallic element having radioactivity, which has physical characteristics suitable for nuclear medical diagnosis and can be readily captured with the chelate forming structure in the chelating compound 2 . Specific examples of the radioactive metallic element are gallium 67 ⁶⁷Ga , gallium 68 ⁶⁸Ga , thallium 201 ²⁰¹Tl , indium 111 ¹¹¹In and tecnethium 99m ⁹⁹ For preparation of the non radioactive carrier of the invention, the polyformyl compound 1 and the chelating compound 2 are subjected to condensation to form a methyleneimine linkage between the formyl group in the former and the the amino group in the latter, optionally followed by reduction of the methyleneimine linkage to the methyleneamine linkage. Depending on the kinds of the reactants and the reaction conditions, the number of units of the chelating compound 2 to be introduced into the polyformyl compound 1 is varied, and generally a larger number of not less than 5 units, especially of not less than 10 units, of the chelating compound 2 per each molecule of the polyformyl compound 1 is better, but at least one formyl group in the polyformyl compound 1 should be left for combination with the physiologically active substance 3 . The resulting polyformyl compound 1 the chelating compound 2 condensation or condensation reduction product hereinafter referred to as the condensation or condensation reduction product as the non radioactive carrier is then condensed with the physiologically active substance 3 , optionally followed by reduction so as to form a methyleneimine group or a methyleneamine group between a formyl group in the polyformyl compound 1 moiety of the former and the amino group in the latter to give the physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product. The number of units of the physiologically active substance 3 to be introduced into the condensation or condensation reduction product varies with the kinds of the reactants, and the reaction conditions, and usually a smaller number of not more than about 10 units, preferably of not more than 3 units, of the physiologically active substance 3 per each molecule of the polyformyl compound 1 is desirable. Alternatively, the physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product may be prepared by first condensing the polyformyl compound 1 with the physiologically active substance 3 to form a methyleneimine linkage between a formyl group in the former and an amino group in the latter, optionally followed by reduction of the methyleneimine linkage to a methyleneamine linkage, to give the physiologically active substance combined polyformyl compound, which is then condensed with the chelating compound 2 to form a methyleneimine linkage between a formyl group in the polyformyl compound moiety of the physiologically active substance combined polyformyl compound and an amino group in the chelating compound 2 , optionally followed by reduction of the methyleneimine linkage to a methyleneamine linkage, whereby the physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product is obtained. As to the numbers of the units of the chelating compound 2 and of the physiologically active substance 3 , the same attention as stated above may be taken. In the above preparation procedures, the reduction to be carried out optionally after the condensation may be accomplished in a single step at the final stage. Further, each of the reactions such as condensation and reduction may be carried out by per se conventional procedures. Furthermore, in the reduction, a formyl group may be converted into a hydroxymethyl group simultaneously with the conversion of a methyleneimine linkage into a methyleneamine linkage. Usually, the condensation can proceed easily at room temperature. For the reduction, a reductive metal hydride compound such as sodium borohydride is favorably employed as the reducing agent. At any stage in the above preparation procedures, the reaction product may be optionally purified by per se conventional methods such as column chromatography, gel permeation and dialysis. The thus obtained physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product may be then labeled with the radioactive metallic element 4 to give a radioactive metallic element labeled, physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product, which is a radioactive diagnostic agent of the invention. Depending upon the kind or state of the radioactive metallic element 4 , two different labeling procedures may be adopted. When the radioactive metallic element 4 is in a valency state which can form a stable chelate compound, the physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product may be contacted with the radioactive metallic element 4 in an aqueous medium to form the radioactive metallic element labeled, physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product as a radioactive diagnostic agent. This labeling manner may be applied to ⁶⁷Ga or ¹¹¹In. When the radioactive metallic element 4 is in a valency state which has to be changed for the formation of a stable chelate compound, the physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product may be contacted with the radioactive metallic element 4 in an aqueous medium in the presence of a reducing agent or an oxidizing agent to form the radioactive metallic element labeled, physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product. This labeling manner may be applied to ⁹⁹ Examples of the reducing agent are stannous salts, i.e. salts of divalent tin ion Sn When, for example, the radioactive metallic element 4 is ⁹⁹ The radioactive diagnostic agent should have sufficient radioactivity and radioactivity concentration to assure reliable diagnosis. For instance, the radioactive metallic element ⁹⁹ The thus produced radioactive metallic element labeled, physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product as a radioactive diagnostic agent is sufficiently stable, and therefore it may be stored as such and supplied on demand. When desired, the radioactive diagnostic agent may contain any suitable additive such as a pH controlling agent e.g. an acid, a base, a buffer , a stabilizer e.g. ascorbic acid or an isotonizing agent e.g. sodium chloride . The radioactive metallic element labeled, physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product of this invention is useful for nuclear medical diagnosis. For example, the ⁹⁹ The radioactive diagnostic agent of this invention may be administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to produce the radioactivity necessary for examination of a particular organ or tissue, by any appropriate route, usually through an intravenous route. For instance, the intravenous administration of a ⁹⁹ The advantages of the physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product of this invention, i.e. the physiologically active substance combined non radioactive carrier may be summarized as follows a it is stable over a long period of time after manufacture b since it can be produced under mild conditions, no unfavorable side reactions such as inactivation, denaturation or decomposition are caused in the physiologically active substance c any physiologically active substance having an amino group can be used as the starting material d even when an amino group is not present, the introduction of such group into a physiologically active substance makes it usable as the starting material e a radioactive metallic element labeled, physiologically active condensation or condensation reduction product can be formed by a very simple procedure, e.g. by merely contacting the physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product with a radioactive metallic element in an aqueous medium. The advantages of the radioactive metallic element labeled, physiologically active substance combined condensation or condensation reduction product used as a radioactive diagnostic agent may be also summaried as follows a it is stable over a long period of time after manufacture b the labeling efficiency with the radioactive metallic element is extremely high nearly 100 c since the labeling operation is quite simple, no unfavorable side reactions such as inactivation, denaturation or decomposition are caused in the physiologically active substance bonded to the condensation or condensation reduction product d among various radioactive metallic elements, the most suitable one for the diagnostic purpose may be chosen so that the diagnosis can be improved not only in quantity but also in quality with reduction of the exposure dose. Practical and presently preferred embodiments of the invention are iilustratively shown in the following Examples. Preparation of polyacrolein Water 50 ml was charged in a flask and heated under reflux while introducing nitrogen gas therein. After cooling below 20 C, potassium peroxodisulfate 0.475 g and acrolein purity, more than 95 10 ml were added thereto. After acrolein was dissolved, a solution of silver nitrate 0.296 g in water 6 ml was dropwise added thereto in about 1 minute while vigorous agitation. The reaction was continued for 2.5 hours, during which care was taken to avoid the elevation of the temperature above 20 c. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was added to water 50 ml , whereby the produced polyacrolein was precipitated. The precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water two times and dispersed in a solution of sodium thiosulfate 0.5 g in water 50 ml , followed by stirring for 1 hour The dispersion was filtered to collect the solid material, which was washed with water several times and dried under reduced pressure overnight to obtain polyacrolein. Polyacrolein 50 mg as prepared above was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide 10 ml , sodium borohydride 3 mg was added thereto, and stirring was continued at room temperature for 1 hour. To the resulting mixture, ethyl acetate 10 ml was added to precipitate partially reduced polyacrolein. The precipitate was collected by filtration, dissolved in water and subjected to measurement of molecular weight by high speed liquid chromatography under the following conditions Since the partially reduced polyacrolein was eluted at a retention volume of 23.2 ml, the molecular weight of polyacrolein was determined to be about 21,000. Preparation of dialdehydrodextran To a solution of dextran average molecular weight, 10,000 3.24 g in 0.1M sodium acetate solution pH, 4.2 200 ml , 0.1M sodium periodate solution 40 ml was added, and the resultant mixture was stirred at a dark place overnight. The reaction mixture was admitted in a cellulose tube and dialyzed to water for 2 days, followed by lyophilization to obtain dialdehydodextran About 50 mg of the above prepared dialdehydodextran was weighed precisely and dissolved in 0.01M phosphoric acid 0.15M sodium chloride buffer 100 ml . The resulting solution about 5 ml was precisely measured, 1 100 N iodine solution 5 ml was added thereto, and further 0.15M sodium carbonate solution 1 ml was added thereto, followed by allowing to stand at room temperature for 1.5 hours. After addition of 0.2 N sulfuric acid 2 ml , titration was carried out with 1 100 N sodium thiosulfate solution until a colorless, transparent solution was obtained. This titration value was taken as A. In the same manner as above, 0.01M phosphoric acid 0.15M sodium chloride buffer 5 ml was titrated with 1 100 N sodium thiosulfate solution, and the resulting titration value was taken as B. The content of aldehyde groups in 1 mg of the product was calculated according to the following equation Aldehyde groups µmole mg A B x10 2W wherein W is the amount of dialdehydrodextran mg contained in 5 ml of the sample. As the result, the aldehyde group content in the dialdehydrodextran as prepared above was determined to be 5.1 µmole mg. A Preparation of the polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product as a non radioactive carrier Polyacrolein molecular weight, 21,000 500 mg was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide 10 ml , and the resultant solution was admixed with a solution of deferoxamine 420 mg in dimethylsulfoxide 10 ml . The reaction was continued at room temperature for 3 hours. To the reaction mixture, sodium borohydride 100 mg was added, and stirring was continued at room temperature for 1 hour. The resultant mixture was subjected to dialysis to water over night, followed by gel chromatography under the following conditions The polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product was eluted at a volume of 270 400 ml, while the unreacted deferoxamine was eluted at a volume of 550 to 600 ml. The eluate containing the polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product was subjected to lyophilization. The polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product thus obtained was dissolved in water, ferric chloride was added thereto, and the resultant solution was analyzed by high speed liquid chromatography under the following conditions to determine a retention volume of 21.2 ml No free deferoxamine was detected. The retention volume of deferoxamine in the above system is 32.8 ml. A definite amount the polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product as obtained above was dissolved in water, and a sufficient amount of an aqueous ferric chloride solution was added thereto to make a 1 1 complex between the deferoxamine moiety in said condensation reduction product and Fe III in said ferric chloride. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 1 hour and then subjected to measurement of absorbance at 420 nm, whereby the number of the deferoxamine moieties in said condensation reduction product was confirmed to be 18.3 per one molecule of polyacrolein. The average molecular weight of said condensation reduction product was thus calculated to be about 32,000. Still, deferoxamine and Fe III can form a 1 1 complex having a maximum absorption at 420 nm, and the ε A Preparation of the polyacrolein hexane diamine 3 oxobutyral bis N methylthiosemicarbazone carboxylic acid condensate condensation reduction product as a non radioactive carrier A solution of 3 oxobutyralbis N methylthiosemicarbazone carboxylic acid hereinafter referred to as KTS 132 mg in dry dioxane 5 ml was cooled to about 10 C. Tri n butylamine 0.12 ml and isobutyl chloroformate 64 µl were added thereto. The resultant mixture was stirred at the same temperature as above for about 50 minutes to obtain a mixed acid anhydride solution. To this solution, a solution of N tert butyloxycarbonyl 1,6 hexanediamine 104 mg in dry dioxane 2 ml was added, and the resultant mixture was stirred at 10 C for about 15 hours to produce N tert butyloxycarbonyl 1,6 hexanediamine KTS condensate. A few drops of conc. hydrochloric acid were added thereto to make a pH of about 2, whereby the N tert butyloxycarbonyl group was eliminated to give a solution of hexanediamine KTS condensate. The above solution was added to a solution of polyacrolein 200 mg in dimethylsulfoxide 5 ml , sodium borohydride 17.2 mg was added thereto, and the resultant mixture was reacted at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was subjected to dialysis by a conventional procedure for 30 hours to eliminate the unreacted reagents and lyophilized to obtain the polyacrolein hexanediamine KTS condensate condensation reduction product useful as a non radioactive carrier. The polyacrolein hexanediamine KTS condensate condensation reduction product as above obtained was dissolved in water to make a concentration of 3 mg ml, and the resulting solution was subjected to measurement of absorbance at 334 nm using water as the control, whereby the number of the KTS moieties in said condensation reduction product was confirmed to be 21.3 per one molecule of polyacrolein. The average molecular weight of said condensation reduction product was thus calculated to be about 29,600. Still, the hexanediamine KTS condensate had a maximum absorption at 334 nm, and its ε B Preparation of the fibrinogen combined polyacrolein hexanediamine KTS condensate condensation reduction product a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier A solution of the non radioactive carrier as obtained in A before lyophilization 5 ml was added to a solution of human fibrinogen 250 mg in 0.01M phosphate buffer 0.15M aqueous sodium chloride mixture pH, 8.4 50 ml , followed by stirring at room temperature for about 3 hours. Sodium borohydride 12.9 mg was added thereto. The resultant mixture was stirred for about 1 hour. The reaction mixture was dialyzed to 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution at 0 to 4 C for 24 hours and then passed through a column of Sepharose 4B diameter, 4.4 cm height, 50 cm using 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution as an eluting solvent. The eluate was lyophilized to give the polyacrolein hexanediamine KTS condensate condensation reduction product as cotton like crystals. The cotton like crystals 100 mg were dissolved in deoxygenated water 160 ml , and 1 mM stannous chloride solution 10 ml and sodium ascorbate 0.6 g were added thereto to make a clear solution. The solution was passed through a filter having a pore diameter of 0.45 µm, and the filtrate 1.5 ml was filled in a vial flushed with nitrogen gas to obtain a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier. The above operations were effected under a sterile condition. The fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as above obtained was a pale yellow, clear solution. C Preparation of the ⁹⁹ To the fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier 1.5 ml as obtained in B , a physiological saline solution 1.5 ml containing ⁹⁹ This solution was pale yellow, transparent. D Properties of the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C The radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C was subjected to electrophoresis 1.7 mA cm 15 minutes using Veronal buffer pH, 8.6 as a developing solvent and a cellulose acetate membrane as an electrophoretic membrane, and scanning was carried out by the use of a radiochromato scanner. The radioactivity was recognized as a single peak at the locus of 0.5 cm distant from the original line towards the negative side. This locus was the same as that of the coloring band of fibrinogen with Ponceau 3R. From the above result, it may be said that the radioactive diagnostic agent has a labeling efficiency of nearly 100 and its electric charge is substantially the same as that of fibrinogen. To the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C , 0.1M sodium diethylbarbiturate hydrochloride buffer pH, 7.3 containing 0.05 calcium chloride was added to make a fibrinogen concentration of 1 mg ml. Thrombin 100 units ml 0.1 ml was added thereto. The resultant mixture was allowed to stand in an ice bath for 30 minutes. The produced fibrinogen clots were completely separated from the liquor, and radioactivity was measured on the clots and also on the liquor. From the obtained results, it was detemined that the clottability of the radioactive diagnostic agent is 93 based on the starting fibrinogen. A Preparation of the polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation product as a non radioctive carrier To a solution of polyacrolein 125 mg in dimethylsulfoxide 2.5 ml , a solution of deferoxamine 105 mg in dimethylsulfoxide 2.5 ml was added, and the resultant mixture was agitated at room temperature for 3 hours to produce a solution containing the polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation product, which is useful as a non radioactive carrier. B Preparation of the fibrinogen combined, polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation product a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier The non radioactive carrier 5 ml as obtained above was added to a solution of human fibrinogen 200 mg in 0.01M phosphate buffer 0.15M aqueous sodium chloride mixture pH, 8.4 at 0 to 4 C, followed by stirring at the same temperature as above for about 3 hours. The reaction mixture was dialyzed to 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution at 0 to 4 C for 24 hours and then passed through a column of Sepharose 4B diameter, 4.4 cm height, 50 cm using 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution as an eluting solvent. The eluate containing the fibrinogen combined polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation product was diluted with 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution to make a fibrinogen concentration of 1 mg ml, and sodium ascorbate was added thereto to make a concentration of 30 mM. The resultant solution 3 ml was admitted into a vial, followed by lyophilization to obtain a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as a cotton like product. The above operations were effected under a sterile condition. A Preparation of the polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation product a non radioctive carrier To a solution of polyacrolein 125 mg in dimethylsulfoxide 2.5 ml , a solution of deferoxamine 105 mg in dimethylsulfoxide 2.5 ml was added, and the resultant mixture was agitated at room temperature for 3 hours to obtain a solution containing the polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation product useful as a non radioactive carrier. B Preparation of the fibrinogen combined polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier The non radioactive carrier 5 ml as obtained above was added to a solution of human fibrinogen 200 mg in 0.01M phosphate buffer 0.15M aqueous sodium chloride mixture pH, 8.4 at 0 to 4 C, followed by stirring at the same temperature as above for about 3 hours. To the resulting mixture, sodium borohydride 7.0 mg was added, and stirring was continued at 0 to 4 C for about 1 hour. To a portion of the reaction mixture, a solution containing ⁶⁷Ga 1 mCi in the form of gallium chloride was added for labeling, and the resultant solution was subjected to high speed liquid chromatography under the following conditions Detection was made on the radioactivity of ⁶⁷Ga. As the result, the eluted pattern gave three peaks attributable to ⁶⁷Ga labeled fibrinogen, ⁶⁷Ga labeled polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product and ⁶⁷Ga labeled deferoxamine. From the area ratio of the peak due to ⁶⁷Ga labeled polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product and the peak due to ⁶⁷Ga labeled deferoxamine, 18.9 of the deferoxamine moieties were confirmed to combine to one molecule of polyacrolein. Since the number of the deferoxamine moieties in the fibrinogen combined polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product was confirmed to be 14.8 per one molecule of fibrinogen, the number of fibrinogen bonded to one molecule of polyacrolein was calculated to be 0.8. The remainder of the reaction mixture was dialyzed to 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium cintrate solution at 0 to 4 C for 24 hours and then passed through a column of Sepharose 4B diameter, 4.4 cm height, 50 cm using 0.04M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution as an eluting solvent. The eluate containing the fibrinogen combined polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product was diluted with 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution to make a fibrinogen concentration of 1 mg ml, and sodium ascorbate was added thereto to make a concentration of 30 mM. The resultant solution 3 ml was admitted into a vial, followed by lyophilization to obtain a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as a cotton like product. The above operations were effected under a sterile condition. The fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as obtained above was dissolved in sterile water to make a fibrinogen concentration of 1 mg ml, and a sufficient amount of an aqueous ferric chloride solution was added thereto to make a 1 1 complex between the deferoxamine moiety in said non radioactive carrier and Fe III in said ferric chloride solution. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 1 hour and then subjected to measurement of absorbance at 420 nm using a solution of said non radioactive carrier in sterile water as the control, whereby the number of the deferoxamine moieties in said non radioactive carrier was confirmed to be 14.8 per one molecule of fibrinogen. C Preparation of the ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product as a radioactive diagnostic agent To the fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as obtained in B , an aqueous solution 2 ml containing ⁶⁷Ga 2 mCi in the form of gallium citrate was added to obtain the ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product as a readioactive diagnostic agent. This solution was pale yellow, transparent and had a pH of about 7.8. C Preparation of the ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined polyacrolein deferoxamine condensation reduction product as a radioactive diagnostic agent The fibrinogen labeled non radioactive carrier obtained in B was dissolved in sterile water, and human fibrinogen 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 or 3.0 mg dissolved in 0.01M phosphate buffer 0.15M aqueous sodium chloride mixture pH, 8.4 and 1 ml of an aqueous solution containing ⁶⁷Ga 1 mCi in the form of gallium citrate were added thereto. The resulting mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour and then subjected to measurement of lebeling rate. In the same manner as above, the labeling rate of ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined deferoxamine as prepared by labeling ⁶⁷Ga onto fibrinogen combined deferoxamine was also measured. The results are shown in Table 1. As understood from the above, the non radioactive carrier of the invention could be labeled with 97.8 of ⁶⁷Ga 1 mci within 1 hour when 1 mg of fibrinogen was used. The conventional non radioactive carrier i.e. fibrinogen combined deferoxamine could be labeled only with 17.0 of ⁶⁷Ga under the same condition as above. Even when 25.1 mg of fibrinogen were used, the conventional non radioactive carrier was labeled with 83.5 of ⁶⁷Ga at the most. It is thus appreciated that the non radioactive carrier of the invention can afford a radioactive diagnostic agent having a higher relative radioactivity. Further, the radioactive diagnostic agent is useful in nuclear medical diagnosis aiming at detection of thrombosis. D properties of the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C The radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C was subjected to electrophoresis 1.7 mA cm 15 minutes using Veronal buffer pH, 8.6 as a developing solvent and a cellulose acetate membrane as an electrophoretic membrane, and scanning was carried out by the use of a radiochromato scanner. The radioactivity was recognized as a single peak at the locus of 0.5 cm distant from the original line towards the negative side. This locus was the same as that of the coloring band of fibrinogen with Ponceau 3R. From the above result, it may be said that the radioactive diagnostic agent has a labeling efficiency of nearly 100 and its electric charge is substantially the same as that of fibrinogen. To the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C , 0.1M sodium diethylbarbiturate hydrochloride buffer pH, 7.3 containing 0.05 calcium chloride was added to make a fibrinogen concentration of 1 mg ml. Thrombin 100 units ml 0.1 ml was added thereto. The resultant mixture was allowed to stand in an ice bath for 30 minutes. The produced fibrinogen clots were completely separated from the liquor, and radioactivity was measured on the clots and also on the liquor. From the obtained results, it was determined that the clottability of the radioactive diagnostic agent is 86 based on the starting fibrinogen. E Behaviors of the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C in rate The radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C 0.2 ml was administered intravenously to each of female rats of SD strain, and the variations of the blood level and the organ distribution with the lapse of time were recorded. The results are shown in Table 2. The extremely high blood level over a long period of time and the figure of distribution into various organs of the radioactive diagnostic agent as shown in Table 2 are quite similar to those of ¹³¹I labeled fibrinogen as conventionally employed. F Behaviors of the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C in thrombosed rabbits Thrombosis was produced in rabbits at the femoral part by the formalin application procedure. To the rabbits, the radioactive diagnostic agent 0.5 ml as obtained in C was administered through the ear vein. After 24 hours from the administration, a constant amount of the blood was sampled, and the locus of thrombosis was taken out. Radioactivity was measured on the blood and the locus of thrombosis. The radioacitivity ratio of the locus of thrombosis to the blood for the same weight was 7.44 3.41 average in 10 animals S.D. value . From the above results, it is understood that the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C has the nearly same physiological activity as fibrinogen does. Thus, the radioactive diagnostic agent is useful for nuclear medical diagnosis.

The animals were fertilized for 10 days, and the variation in bodyweight during that period was recorded. No significant difference was recognized between the medicated groups and the control groups. After 10 days from the administration, all the animals were sacrificed and subjected to observation of the abnormality in various organs. No abnormality was seen in any of the animals.

Tri n butylamine 0.12 ml and isobutyl chloroformate 64 ml were added thereto. The resultant mixture was stirred at the same temperature as above for about 50 minutes to obtain a mixed acid anhydride solution. To this solution, a solution of N tert butyloxycarbonyl 1,6 hexanediamine 104 mg in dry dioxane 2 ml was added, and the resultant mixture was stirred at 10 C for about 15 hours to produce N tert butyloxycarbonyl 1,6 hexanediamine KTS condensate. A few drops of conc. hydrochloric acid were added thereto to make a pH of about 2, whereby the N tert butyloxycarbonyl group was eliminated to give a solution of hexanediamine KTS condensate. The above solution was added to a solution of dialdehydostarch 200 mg in dimethylsulfoxide 5 ml , sodium borohydride 17.2 mg was added thereto, and the resultant mixture was reacted at room temperature for 3 hours.

The eluate was lyophilized to give the dialdehydostarch hexanediamine KTS condensate condensation reduction product as cotton like crystals. The cotton like crystals 100 mg were dissolved in deoxygenated water 160 ml , and 1 mM stannous chloride solution 10 ml and sodium ascorbate 0.6 g were added thereto to make a clear solution. The solution was passed through a filter having a pore diameter of 0.22 µm, and the filtrate 1.5 ml was filled in a vial flushed with nitrogen gas to obtain a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as a pale yellow, transparent solution.

The radioactivity was recognized as a single peak at the locus of 0.5 cm distant from the original line towards the negative side. This locus was the same as that of the coloring band of fibrinogen with Ponceau 3R. From the above result, it may be said that the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C has a labeling efficiency of nearly 100 and its electric charge is substantially the same as that of fibrinogen.

An aqueous solution of dialdehydrostarch 25 mg ml 2 ml was added thereto, and stirring was continued at room temperature for 15 minutes to obtain a solution containing the dialdehydostarch deferoxamine condensation product which is useful as a non radioactive carrier.

To the resulting mixture, sodium borohydride 12.9 mg was added, and stirring was continued at 0 to 4 C for about 1 hour for reduction. To a portion of the reaction mixture, a solution of gallium citrate containing ⁶⁷Ga 1 mCi was added for labeling, and the resultant solution was subjected to high speed liquid chromatography under the following conditions Detection was made on the radioactivity of ⁶⁷Ga. As the result, the eluted pattern gave three peaks attributable to ⁶⁷Ga labeled fibrinogen, the ⁶⁷Ga labeled dialdehydrostarch deferoxamine condensation reduction product and ⁶⁷Ga labeled deferoxamine. From the area ratio of the peak due to ⁶⁷Ga labeled dialdehydrostarch deferoxamine condensation reduction product and the peak due to ⁶⁷Ga labelled deferoxamine, it was confirmed that 17.4 of the deferoxamine moieties are combined to one molecule of dialdehydostarch. Since the number of deferoxamine moieties in the fibrinogen combined dialdehydrostarch deferoxamine condensation reduction product was confirmed to be 15.2 per one molecule of fibrinogen, the number of fibrinogen bonded to one molecule of dialdehydrostarch was calculated as about 0.9. The remainder of the reaction mixture was dialyzed to 0.01M glucose 0.35M sodium citrate solution at 0 to 4 C for 24 hours and then passed through a column of Sepharose 4B diameter, 4.4 cm height, 50 cm using the same solution as above as an eluting solvent.

The resultant solution 3 ml was filled in a vial, followed by lyophilization to obtain a fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as a cotton like product. The above operations were effected under a sterile condition. The fibrinoge combined non radioactive carrier was dissolved in sterile water to make a fibrinogen concentration of 1 mg ml, and a sufficient amount of an aqueous ferric chloride solution was added thereto to make a 1 1 complex between the deferoxamine moiety in said non radioactive carrier and Fe III in said ferric chloride solution. The reaction mixture was allowed to stand for 1 hour and then subjected to measurement of absorbance at 420 nm using a solution of said non radioactive carrier in sterile water as control, whereby the number of the deferoxamine moieties in said non radioactive carrier was confirmed to be 15.2 per one molecule of fibrinogen. C Preparation of the ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined dialdehydostarch deferoxamine condensation reduction product as a radioactive diagnostic agent To the fibrinogen combined non radioactive carrier as obtained in B , an aqueous solution 2 ml containing ⁶⁷Ga 2 mCi in the form of gallium citrate was added to obtain the ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined dialdehydostarch deferoxamine condensation reduction product as a radioactive diagnostic agent. This solution was pale yellow, transparent and had a pH of about 7.8. C Preparation of the ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined dialdehydostarch deferoxamine condensation reduction product as a radioactive diagnostic agent The non radioactive carrier obtained in B was dissolved in sterile water, and human fibrinogen 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 or 3.0 mg dissolved in 0.01M phosphoric acid 0.15M sodium chloride buffer pH, 8.4 and 1 ml of an aqueous solution containing ⁶⁷Ga 1 mCi in the form of gallium citrate were added thereto. The resulting mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour and then subjected to measurement of lebeling rate. In the same manner as above, the labeling rate of ⁶⁷Ga labeled, fibrinogen combined deferoxamine as prepared by labeling ⁶⁷Ga onto fibrinogen combined deferoxamine was also measured. The results are shown in Table 3. As understood from the above, the non radioactive carrier of the invention could be labeled with 100 of ⁶⁷Ga 1 mCi within 1 hour when 1 mg of fibrinogen was used. The conventional non radioactive carrier i.e. fibrinogen combined deferoxamine could be labeled only with 17.0 of ⁶⁷Ga under the same condition as above. Even when 25.1 mg of fibrinogen were used, the conventional non radioactive carrier is labeled with 83.5 of ⁶⁷Ga at the most. It is thus appreciated that the non radioactive carrier of the invention can afford a radioactive diagnostic agent having a higher relative radioactivity. Further, the radioactive diagnostic agent is useful in nuclear medical diagnosis aiming at detection of thrombosis.

The radioactivity was recognised as a single peak at the locus of 0.5 cm distant from the original line towards the negative side. This locus was the same as that of the coloring band of fibrinogen with Ponceau JR. From the above result, it may be said that the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C has a labeling efficiency of nearly 100 and its electric charge is substantially the same as that of fibrinogen. To the radioactive diagnostic agent as obtained in C , 0.1M sodium diethylbarbiturate hydrochloride buffer pH, 7.3 containing 0.05 calcium chloride was added to make a fibrinogen concentration of 1 mg ml.

The extremely high blood level over a long period of time and the figure of distribution into various organs of the radioactive diagnostic agent as shown in Table 4 are quite similar to those of ¹³¹I labeled fibrinogen as conventionally employed. F Behaviors of the radioactive diagnostic agent obtained in C in thrombosed rabbits Thrombosis was produced in rabbits at the femoral part by the formalin application procedure. To the rabbits, the radioactive diagnostic agent 0.5 ml obtained in C was administered through the ear vein. After 24 hours from the administration, a constant amount of the blood was sampled, and the locus of thrombosis was taken out. Radioactivity was measured on the blood and the locus of thrombosis. The radioacitivity ratio of the locus of thrombosis to the blood for the same weight was 8.63 3.83 average in 10 animals S.D. value . From the above results, it is understood that the radioactive diagnostic agent obtained in C has the nearly same physiological activity as fibrinogen does. Thus, the radioactive diagnostic agent is useful for nuclear medical diagnosis.

As the control, the same volume of a physiological saline solution as above was intravenously administered to the separate groups of the same animals as above. The animals were fertilized for 10 days, and the variation in bodyweight during that period was recorded. No significant difference was recognized between the medicated groups and the control groups. After 10 days from the administration, all the animals were sacrificed and subjected to observation of the abnormality in various organs. No abnormality was seen in any of the animals. From the above results, it may be said that the toxicity of the non radioactive carrier of the invention is extremely low.
