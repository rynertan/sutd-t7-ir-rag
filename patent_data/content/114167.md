## Description
Field of the invention The present invention relates to portable games, more specifically to an improved pocket sized chess set.Background of the invention Various types of pocket sized chess sets have been disclosed in the prior art. Among these, one well known chess set is the one having holes in each space of the checkerboard adapted to receive a peg formed in the chessmen. If there is any vibration of the checkboard, as on a train or airplane, the chessmen set is liable to be jarred loose from its holes and so ruin the game. Another disadvantage of this type of chess set is that, when the game is interrupted, captured chessmen have to be carried in a separate container and may be lost. Still another disadvantage is that the chessmen are very small, because they stay upright on the chessboard when the latter is carried in ones pocket. They are therefore difficult to identify.In another type of pocket sized chess set, the chessmen lay flat on the chessboard and the chessplayer has difficulty to identify the three different values of chessmen, since he is accustomed to do so by the three different heights of the chessmen in a regular chess set.Objects of the invention Accordingly, it is a first object of the present invention to provide a pocket sized chess set in which the chessboard is foldable in two to form a case and wherein each chessman may be positioned either vertically for play, or horizontally for storage therefore, the chessmen have a sufficient height for easy identification and yet the chessboard has a minimum width when closed for carrying in ones pocket. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a portable chess set, wherein the chessmen carry permanent magnets to adhere the same to the checkerboard and the latter is formed of two flat panels which fold together by the magnetic attraction of the chessmen. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a portable chess set vhich is simple in design and construction.Summary of the invention The above and other objects and advantages of the present invention are realized according to a preferred embodiment comprising a generally rectangular carrying case composed of a pair of identical panels and a third intermediate panel. The inner sides of the first two panels are each pivotally secured to either side, respectively, of the third panel, the latter extending between the inner sides of the first two panels. Thus, the first two panels can be folded together with the third panel acting as a spine to make a thin compact carrying case. The perimeter of each of the first two panels is provided with an inwardly extending flange defining a perimetrical slot between the bottom surfaces of the panels and the flange itself. The slot retains, on each of the first two panels, half of a checkerboard, made of paramagnetic material. Each of these halves is adapted to slide horizontally, from a first retracted position when the first two panels are folded, to a second playing position, wherein their inner sides touch to form an integral checkerboard. Means are provided to move each checkerboard half between the two positions. Other means are also provided to limit the inward movement of each checkerboard half. Each square of the checkerboard halves has a recessed portion for a purpose explained below. The chess set of the invention also includes thirtytwo chessmen. Each of these chessmen is relatively thin and is provided with a magnetic element having a back surface and a narrow bottom surface projecting slightly below its lower end. Thus, each chessman may be positioned on the checkerboard either vertically for play, or horizontally for storage. In both positions, the magnetic element is in contact with the recessed portion, so that each piece is properly centered on its square. When a piece is laid horizontally on a square, it lies perfectly flat because the back surface of its magnetic element extends into the recess. The outer edges of each checkerboard half are also recessed for the placing of captured chessmen thereon during the course of the game. If the game must be interrupted and stored or carried, these chessmen will not be a hindering factor to the closing of the two panels together. No means are necessary to close the panels together, since the magnetic attraction of the chessmen for one another is enough to assure a closing force. The above will be more clearly understood by having referral to the preferred embodiment of the invention, illustrated by way of the accompanying drawings, in which Brief description of the drawings Figure 1 is a top plan view of the chess set showing the checkerboard halves in retracted positions, also showing several chessmen in both upright and flat position, also showing a portion of the edge of one panel broken away to reveal the checkboard half stop means Figure 2 is an enlarged top plan view of the centerleft side of the chess set shoring the checkerboard halves in playing position Figure 3 is a lateral elevation or the two panels in closed position, also showing in dashed outline how one of the panels pivots to a closed position Figure 4 is a cross sectional view taken along line 4 4 of Figure 2 Figure 5 is also a cross sectional view taken along line 5 5 of Figure 1 Figure 6 is another cross sectional view taken along line 6 6 of Figure 1 and Figure 7 is a perspective view of a chessman showing, in dashed outline, an exploded view of the magnetic element. Like numerals refer to like elements throughout the drawings.Detailed description of the invention The pocket sized chess set 1 of the present invention comprises a pair of identical rectangular panels 2 and a third intermediate panel 3, all of the above being made of rigid plastic or other suitable material. The inner edge 2 of each panel 2 is hingedly secured to one side of intermediate panel 3 at 4, as clearly shown in Figure 4. Thus, either panel 2 can be pivoted from a first open flat position to a closed position for storage or carrying purposes, as shown in Figure 3. In closed position, the panels form a thin, compact case. The top surface of each panel 2 is provided with a horizontally slidable checkerboard half 5, made of para magnetic material, such as steel. To retain the latter in position, the lateral and outer edges of each panel 2 have an invardly projecting peripheral flange 6, which defines a slot 7. As seen clearly in Figures 5 and 6, the edges of checkerboard halves 5 are slidingly engaged in slot 7 and can slide from a retracted position shown in Figure 1 and an engaged play position shown in Figure 4 , wherein their inner sides 5 meet over intermediate panel 3 to form a complete checkerboard. An upwardly projecting tab 8 is secured to each half 5 adjacent their rear edges to slide the halves 5 from one position to the other. Means are also provided to properly center the halves 5 together when they form a complete checkerboard, consisting of a notch 9 located on each lateral side edge of each half 5 and adjacent the inner edge of each of the latter. Notch 9 is adapted to engage a protuberance 14 formed on flange 6 adjacently thereof. As shown clearly in Figure 1, each half 5 is made with alternating light and dark squares 10 in quincunx. Squares 10 each have a central circular recess 10 . A set of thirty two chessmen 11 is also an integralpart of the invention. It is to be noted that one particular disadvantage of prior art pocket sized chess games is that the chessmen themselves are difficult to identify, because of small size and amorphous detail. To rectify this disadvantage, chessmen 11 of the present invention are relatively tall and provided with detail. For example, the kings and queens are approximately one inch tall. Each chessman 11 is made of molded plastic and is provided with a small magnetic element, namely a permanent magnet 12, having a back surface 12 and a narrower buttom surface 12 , both surfaces being positive. It will be clear that chessmen 11. may be placed either uprightly or flat on squares 10. When laid flat, back surface 12 directly adheres to checkerboard half 5. In both positions, magnetic elements 12 will hold the chessmen 11 in place. Thus, a game may be played to a certain point and then interrupted by merely laying chessmen 11 flat to close the panels 2 without moving any chessman 11 from its position on the checkerboard. The depth of recess 10 in each square 10 is approximately equal to the distance, so that the back surface 12 protrudes from the back of each chessman 11. When the panels 2 are closed, the attraction between magnetic elements 1 2 and the superposed checkerboard halves 5, provides enough force to keep panels 2 in closed position. When the panels are closed the air gap and the intervening layer of chessman plastic material between the two permanent magnets 1 2 of opposite chessmen, are sufficient to prevent magnetic attraction of said two pieces, so that each piece remains attracted to its checkerboard half 5 when the panels are re opened. There is one additional feature to the invention each checkerboard half 5 is provided with a lateral and outer side peripheral margin 13. This margin,13 is recessed to the same depth as recesses 10 in the checkerboard squares 10.Captured chessmen 11 may be conveniently laid flat in margins 13 without stopping the game if the chess set must be closed and without interfering with the closing of the panels 2.
