# Detergent compositions.

## Abstract
The foaming performance in hard water of dishwashing detergent compositions containing dialkyl sulphosuccinates is enhanced by including in the composition a substantially water soluble protein having a Bloom gel strength of at least 50 g, preferably from 150 to 300 g and especially from 200 to 250 g. The protein is advantageously a gelatin.
