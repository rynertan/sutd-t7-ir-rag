# Vulcanization accelerator for chloroprene rubber.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a vulcanization accelerator for chloroprene rubber which has a thioglycolic acid ester as its main com ponent and which gives chloroprene products improved in physical properties, particularly tear strength. A modified vul canization accelerator obtained by having an inorganic pow der impregnated with, or adsorb, a thioglycolic acid ester constitutes a preferred embodiment in respect that it avoids emitting the offensive odor of mercaptan and permits easy handling.
