# Flexible arm, particularly a robot arm.

## Abstract
A flexible arm particularly a robot arm comprising a plurality of elements engaging each other and being arranged in a series, said elements being interconnected via cables and if desired power transferring actuating means. The purpose of the invention is to provide an arm having very good rigidity in the bending plane of the element and a high torsional resistance together with lower manufacturing costs as compared to conventional robot arms. This has been achieved thereby that each element 11 is designed with arched opposed single or double curved segments 8, 9 which with their curved contact surfaces 5 are located to engage the contact surface of the nearest adjacent seg ment, whereby the elements 11 are arranged when actu ated by said power generating and or power transferring means 14 to make a rolling motion relative to each other.
