# Optical heterodyne detection pulse receiving system and method.

## Abstract
A photodiode 4 detects an intermediate frequency signal from an incoming pulse modulated light carrier 1 and a local oscillator light beam 6 superimposed by means of a half silvered mirror 2 . The intermediate frequency e.g. 128 MHz is a multiple e.g. 4 times the modulating pulse repetition frequency e.g. 32 MHz which is extracted by a timing circuit 10 . The intermediate frequency is divided in divider 14 by the said multiple and then phase compared with the pulse repetition frequency in an oscillator control circuit 15 completing a phase locked loop for the laser oscillator 5 which generates the local oscillator light beam 6 . Jitter and wave form distortion problems with the regenerated pulses are thus avoided even with a significantly lower intermediate frequency than has heretofore been necessary.
