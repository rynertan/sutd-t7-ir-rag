# Process for producing an aldehydelactone.

## Abstract
A process for producing 3 oxo 6 formyl 2 oxabicyclo 3.3.0 6 octene useful as an intermediate for producing prostaglandins , via a few steps from relatively easily prepared raw materials, comprises subjecting 2,2 dimethyl 1,3 dioxin 4 one and cis 2 cyclopenten 1,4 diol to addition reaction typically in a solvent, preferably under a photoirradiation, removing any solvent from the reaction mixture, adding water to the resulting adducts and reacting the resulting mixture on heating.
