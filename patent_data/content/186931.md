# Frequency stabilized automatic gain controlled ballast system.

## Abstract
A frequency stabilized automatic gain controlled ballast system 10 which is coupled to a power source 12 in order to operate at least one of a pair of gas discharge tubes 40 and 40 . Each of the gas discharge tubes 40, 40 include respective filaments 42, 44 and 42 , 44 . A frequency control circuit 11 is coupled to the power source 12 and includes a frequency control transformer 43 and a frequency con trol capacitor 50 for establishing a constant oscillation sig nal at a predetermined frequency. A switching network 13 is connected to the frequency control circuit 11 for estab lishing a pulsating current responsive to the constant os cillation signal of predetermined frequency. Induction cir cuitry 15 is coupled to the switching network 13 and the frequency control circuit 11 and includes an inverter trans former 78 as well as coupling capacitors 86 and 88 for generating a voltage across the gas discharge tubes 40 and 40 . Automatic gain control circuitry 17 is included in in verter transformer 78 and is made up of a pair of second ary windings 80 and 81 wound in a manner to provide a negative feedback voltage to each of the transistors 70 and 70 of switching network 13 . The inverter transformer 78 has a pair of primary windings 82 and 84 which operate al ternately and are coupled to the primary winding 45 of fre quency control transformer 43 to provide a repetitive cy cle. First and second coupling capacitors 86 and 88 are coupled to primary windings 82 and 84 of inverter trans former 78 and filaments 42 and 42 of gas discharge tubes 40 and 40 for discharging the induced voltage across the tubes 40 and 40 .
