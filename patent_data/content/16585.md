# Apparatus and method for converting organic material into fuel.

## Abstract
Organic material is heated in a pyrolytic reactor 15 in which an initial charge of charcoal is located, thereby driving off volatiles from the organic material while leaving charcoal char behind. The volatiles are then passed over a base mat erial which is at a temperature substantially above the pyroliz ing temperature which causes a chemical reaction of the tars and volatiles, resulting in an output of a gaseous mixture consisting largely of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, charac terized by an absence of tars. The reactor 15 is arranged to permit a continuous flow of organic material volatiles, and char through it, resulting in continual replenishment of organic material in its pyrolizing portion, and replenishment of the charcoal bed portion by the char produced from the pyrolysis reaction.
