# Rotary compressor.

## Abstract
The rotary air compressor 10 includes a rotor 18 which rotates within a housing 18 and controls communication through inlet 42 and outlet 44 ports provided on the hous ing and compresses air communicated through the inlet port 42 for delivery to the outlet port 44 . The inlet and outlet ports 42, 44 are provided with check valves 50, 52 control ling communication therethrough. After the rotor 18 rotates through a dead center position, the check valves 50, 52 in both the inlet and outlet ports 42,44 are closed. The rotor 18 then rotates into a position in which the apex seals 34, 36 carried by the rotor 18 wipe across the inlet and outlet ports 42, 44 simultaneously, thereby opening a communication path bypassing the apex seals 34, 36 so that the pressure levels in the chambers 36, 40 across the rotor 18 are equal ized. As the rotor 18 continues to rotate, air is compressed and communicated to the outlet port 44 .
