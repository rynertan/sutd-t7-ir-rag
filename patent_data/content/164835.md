## Description
ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR This invention relates to electrical connectors of the kind wherein a plurality of terminals are carried by a common body for mating engagement with an array of corresponding terminals carried by a further component.It is known, in a connector of the kind specified, to provide the body with a transversely extending passage into which is fitted a locking bar which co operates with the body, and with the terminals housed in the body, to retain the terminals in place within the body.It is also known in connectors of the kind specified to provide the connector, on its two opposite end walls, with integral latch devices for retaining the body in engagement with the mating component in use.A problem arises in connectors of the type specified when it is desired to provide both latching devices on the opposite end walls, and a locking bar which is inserted tranversely from one of the end walls since the provision of one obstructs the other.It is an object of the present invention to provide a connector of the kind specified wherein this problem is minimised.An electrical connector in accordance with the present invention includes a moulded synthetic resin body housing a plurality of parallel terminals, a passage extending within the body from one end wall thereof, said passage extending transverse to the length of said terminals, a locking bar for insertion into said passage from said one end of the body, said locking bar when fully inserted in said passage co operating with said body and said terminals to retain said terminals in the body, a first latch device integral with the body at the end wall of the body opposite said one end wall, and a further latch device integral with one end of said locking bar, said further latch device being positioned at said one end wall of the body when the locking bar is fully inserted in said passage, said latch devices being arranged for co operation with corresponding parts of a component with which said body is engaged in use, releasably to retain said body in engagement with said component.Desirably said latch devices are rockable levers.Conveniently said locking bar includes a wall component 18 which, in operative position of the locking bar, forms part of the end wall of the bodyPreferably the locking bar and the body include detent means for retaining the locking bar in its operative position relative to the body.One example of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein Figures 1 is an exploded perspective representation of an electrical connector Figure, 2 is a side elevational view of the connector of Figure 1 assembled Figure 3 is a view in the direction of arrow X inFigure 1 Figure 4 is a view in the direction of arrow Y inFigure 1 Figure 5 is a plan view of the body of the connector shown in Figures l and 2 Figure 6 is a composite sectional view generally along the line 6 6 in Figure 5 Figure 7 is a sectional view on the line 7 7 in Figure 6 andFigure 8 is a fragmentary transverse sectional view of the body of the connector showing terminals and the locking bar in place.Referring to the drawings, the electrical connector comprises a moulded synthetic resin body 11, a moulded synthetic resin locking element 12 engageable with the body 11, and a plurality of electrical terminals 13 housed in the body 11.The connector is intended for engagement with a corresponding component also carrying terminals, in such a manner that the terminals of the component and the terminals 13 mate to provide an electrical connection between conductive leads not shown connected to the terminals 13 and conductors electrically connected to the terminals of said other component. It may be that the other component is a further, similar connector the terminals of which are electrically and physically connected to respective leads, or alternatively it may be that the other component is a connection block of an electrical device the terminals of the connection box being connected directly, or through printed circuits, to various parts of the device. The usage of the connector and the nature of the mating component are not of importance to the invention.The moulded synthetic resin body 11 is formed with terminal receiving passages 14 extending through the body 11 from the top surface to the lower surface. The passages 14 are arranged in two parallel rows as is best seen in Figure 6 and the terminals 13 received in the respective passages 14 have their mating portions adjacent the lower end of their respective passages and their lead connecting portions adjacent the upper end of their passages. It will be recognised therefore that the leads not shown connected to the terminals will extend from the upper surface of the body 11. In known manner each of the terminals 13 includes a resilient lance which, when the terminal is correctly positioned within its respective passage 14, co operates with the wall of the passage to resist withdrawal of the terminal. The terminals are inserted from the upper end of their respective passages and the passages include abutment surfaces limiting the insertion. Thus the terminals are located along the length of their respective passages by co action with the walls of the passage.Extending transversely of the body, that is to say at right angles to the axes of the passages 14 and the length of the terminals 13 is a notional passage 15 of inverted T shaper the passage being defined by aligned T shaped apertures 15b in the internal dividing walls of body. The passage 15 extends, in, effect, from one end wall 16 of the body 11 and terminates within the body 11 adjacent the opposite end wall 17. The notional passage 15 thus intersects each of the passages 14 and when the locking element 12 is fully engaged with the body 11 it co operates with the terminals 13 to retain the terminals 13 in their respective passages 14 as can be seen in Figure 8 .It will be understood that co operation of the locking element with the terminals provides a secondary retaining function, the primary retaining function being provided by the co action of the resilient lances of the terminals and the walls of their respective 1passages 14. The locking element 12 is a synthetic resin moulding including a flat wall component 18 having a locking bar 19 of generally inverted T shape cross section extending at right angles thereto. Engagement of the locking element 12 with the body 11 involves insertion of the free end of the locking bar 19 into the passage 15, that is to say through the apertures defining the passages 15, the locking element being slid laterally with respect to the body 11 so that the locking bar 19 extends along the full length of the notional passage 15 and the wall portion 18 closes the aperture 15a in the end wall 16 of the body 11. The upper edge of the locking bar 19 is formed with a spaced pair of integral teeth 23 which co operate with respective interior dividing walls of the body to retain the locking element 12 in engagement with the body 11. Application of sufficient withdrawal force to the locking element 12 will cause the teeth 23 to ride over the edges of the apertures in the interior walls of the body 11 and permit withdrawal of the element 12. As is best seen in Figures 3 and 8, the lowermost face of the locking bar 19 is formed with a groove 24 which co operates with a rib 25 upstanding within the passage 15. Co action of the groove 24 and rib 25 assisted by the corresponding shaping of the bar 19 and apertures 15b in the dividing walls, serves to guide the locking bar 19 within the body 11. The pair of outwardly extending flanges 26 at the lower edge of the locking bar 19 also co operate with the terminals 13 to retain the terminals 13 in position relative to the body.Integral with the body 11 and positioned at the end wall 17 of the body 11 is a first latch device in the form of a latch lever 27. The latch lever extends parallel with the end wall 17 but is spaced therefrom.At a point intermediate its mid point and its upper end the lever 27 is connected to the body 11 by a pair of flexible parallel necks 28 integral with the lever 27 and the wall 17. It will be recognised therefore that by applying pressure to the upper end of the lever 27 to move it towards the wall 17 then the lever 27 can be rocked about the necks 28, by flexure of the necks 28 thus moving the lower end of the lever 27 away from the wall 17. At its lower end the lever 27 is formed with an integral hook portion 29.The locking element 12 is formed with a latch device identical to that of the body 11. Thus the wall portion 18 of the element 12 supports, at its face opposite the locking bar 19, a latch lever 27a having a hook portion 29a at its lower end. The latch lever 27a is spaced from the wall portion 18 by a pair of parallel transversely spaced neck portion 28a integral with the lever 27a and the wall portion 18.It will be recognised that when the locking element 12 is fully engaged with the body 11 and the wall portion 18 thereof constitutes part of the wall 16 of the body 11 then the connector has a latch device at both opposite end walls thereof.The hook portions 29, 29a of the latch levers 27, 27a are arranged to co operate with mating latch elements of the mating component of the connector. For example the mating component may include a shroud, or a recess, into which the lower end of the body 11 is introduced in order to mate the terminals 13 with the corresponding terminals of the corresponding component.When the body 11 is fully engaged with the corresponding component, the hook portions 29 engage the corresponding latch elements to resist withdrawal of the body from the component. However, withdrawal can be effected by pressing the upper ends of the levers 27, 27a towards one another thus moving the hook portions 29, 29a apart and out of engagement with the corresponding latch elements. Such release of the latches is accompanied by applying a withdrawal force to the body 11 to withdraw the body 11 from the corresponding component. It will be noted that the lower faces of the hook portions 29, 29a are chamfered so that during insertion of the body 11 into the mating component the levers 27, 27a will be moved by the cam action occurring between the inclined faces of the hook portions 29, 29a and the latch elements. Thus manual manipulation of the latch devices is not necessary to effect latching during mating of the body 11 with the corresponding component.It will be understood that the exact nature of the terminals, their arrangement in the body, and the shaping of the locking element 12 is not of importance to the invention. The provision of the latch device 27a, 28a, 29a on the locking element 12 ensures that a connector can be produced having latching devices on its opposite end walls, and also having a terminal locking bar inserted from one of the end walls.
