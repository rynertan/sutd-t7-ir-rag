# Torque sensor and method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
There are disclosed a torque sensor having a rotary shaft and a thin strip of an amorphous magnetic alloy which has a great magnetic strain constant windingly fixed on the rotary shaft and detecting a torque in a non contact style by a variation in magnetic properties of the thin strip of the amorphous alloy, characterized in that the amorphous alloy is an iron based amorphous alloy having a crystallization temperature of 450 C or more, and a method for manufac turing the same, characterized in that an inductive magnetic anisotropy had been previously given to the thin strip and then the thin strip is windingly fixed on the rotary shaft. The torque sensor according to the present invention permits measuring a large torque with a good accuracy in an extensive temperature, and is manufactured with ease.
