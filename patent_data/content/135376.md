# Polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block polymer based adjuvants and vaccines using them.

## Abstract
An adjuvant composition comprising an immuno potentiating amount of an immunostimulating glycopeptide a multi phase forming amount of a non toxic polyoxypropy lene polyoxyethylene block polymer in an amount of 0.2 to 49 by volume v v a multi phase stabilizing amount of a glycol ether based surfactant in an amount between 0.05 to 2.5 by volume v v optionally a metabolizable, non toxic oil in an amount between 1 to 30 by volume v v and buffered isoosmotic saline in a quantity sufficient to make volume. This composition can be mixed with an antigen for administration as a vaccine to a bird or mammal.
