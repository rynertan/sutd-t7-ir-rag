# Apparatus to transform a single frequency, linearly polarized laser beam into a high efficiency beam with two, orthogonally polarized frequencies.

## Abstract
An electro optical apparatus transforms a single stabil ized frequency, linearly polarized laser input beam 18 from a light source 10 into an output beam 28 having two collinear orthogonally polarized output beam components differing in frequency from each other by the frequency of a frequency stabilized electrical signal 32 provided from an electronic oscillator 30 . The input of the oscillator 30 is provided to a power amplifier 34 which is used to drive a piezoelectric transducer 40 affixed to an acousto optical Bragg cell 44 through which the input beam 18 passes and is transformed into the output beam 28 composed of the two beam components. The electrical output 36 of the power amplifier 34 is adjusted so that each of the output beam components have approximately the same intensity which is each approximately half of the input beam 18 to provide a nominal efficiency of about 100 .
