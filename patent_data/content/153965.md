## Description
Cartridge filter with cut out device Cartridge filters are known for the most different fluids and particular ly for water. Such filters cause many inconveniences. To connect them to inflow and outflow ducts, many and ccmplicated fittings and auxiliary valve devices are required, both for making up the distance between the filter fittings and the duct positions on which it must be fitted, and to allow the cartridge insulation from the circuit whenever it nist be cleaned or replaced. Complicated fittings and valve devices are also re quired if the filtering action has to be interrupted by directly connect ing the inflow and outflow pipes, or if filtering is wish to be carried out but in sane given periods of time.The connection with other clean ing devices, such as softeners, dechlorers, conditioners and others, ge nerelly turns out to be complex and causes considerable connection pro blends. The above invented device eliminates these inconveniences, offer ing other considerable advantages, as it will be hereafter illustnated. Object of the invention is a cartridge filter associated with a valve apt to connect at wish the inflow and outflow bores, or directly either by excluding the filtering cartridge or Through this one. The valve is obtained with a drawer device, or similar ones, which in one position directly connects the inflow and outflow bores of the fluid, whereas in another position it compels the fluid to pass through the filtering cartridge.The drawer valve consists of four chambers twv central adja cent respectively connected with the one and the other inflow fitting of the fluid to filter and for the outflow of the filtered fluid, and ather two end chambers by the side of each of the other two central ones the drawer valve in the filtering position closes, with a dia tra , the oommunication between the central ehambers, keeping opened the communica tions respectively between the central and the end adjacent one comuni cating with the filtering cartridge in the position of filtering exclu sion, on the contrary, the drawer diaphragms shuts the communications of each central chamber with the outer ones, leaving the free caiim,ni cation between the central chambers. The inflow openings are placed along a tangential axis of the filter body and turned one on the opposi te side of the other so as to enable the filter to be fitted in the ducts of the different devices, and the opening axis can also coincide with the piping one.The filter substantially consists of a cartridge container and of a head connected by means of an intermediate distributor. The inflow and outflow bores are opened on the upper part of the head and tangentiAlly to it, wfiereas the valve body containing the drawer valve is fitted by their side and in parallel position to their axis.The distributor body shows three parallel ducts, of which an axial one and two side ones one of the two side ducts is passing so as to connect one chamber of the valve body, when the valve is open, with the inflow opening and with the container of the filtering cartridge the central conduit base is connectted with the inside upper part of the filtering cartridge and, by of a side offtake, with the other side duct communicating with one champ ber of the valve body, which in its turns oommunicated with the outflow opening when the valve is open.The distributor body can be replaced with another also fitted with three parallel ducts one side conduit acts like the already described distributor, whereas the central duct lower part is connected with the inside upper part of the filtering cartrid ge and by means of a side offtake with an inflow opening suitable for con cection with another apparatus for fluid treatment, such as a depuratcr or other, the other side duct being laterally connected with the outlet opening for this other cleaning device and, on the upper side, with a chamber of the valve body this one communicated with the outflow outfit of the filtered water when the valve is open.The said filter includes a mixer of the filtered fluid with the one still to filter consisting of a body including a conical duct connected at one side with the fitting which feeds the fluid to filter and with the fitting distributing the filtered fluid at the other side, so that the same fluid pressure determines the run of the not filtered fluid which is automatically added to the not filtered one. The mixer includes a pin valve and similar one, allowing to t ge the width of the cone vertex so that, by acting on this valve, it is possible to regulate at wish the same width and, therefore, the run.The filter just described is its different kinds turns out to be particularly suitable. for the water filtering, either in connection or not with other devices, such as water cleaners and others, therefore, as softeners, dechIorers, conditioners and so on.The features and the purposes of the invented device will turn out still clearer from the examples of execution fitted with schematic sketches given here below.Fig. 1 Perspective view of the filter.Fig. 2 Transversal section of the head.Fig. 3 Longitudinal section of the distributor.Fig. 4 Variant form of the filter for connection with a cleaner in perspective view.Fig. 5 Section of the distributor.Fig. 6 Particular of the mixer longitudinal section.Fig. 7 Filter in connection with a cleaner in perspective view. Filter 10 substantially consists of a glass 11 a a ii ting the filtering cartridge 12, connected by means of ring 14 to distributor 13, below head 15. This last one, in its turn, includes the cylinfrical valve body 16 fitted with an inside drawer axially sliding in the cylindrical position 18 Fig. 2 and to be operated from outside by means of knob 17 connected to drawer with pin 31.The cylindrical lodgement 18 includes the outer chambers 19 and 20, car cating respectively with ducts 25 and 26 of the distributor by means of bores 21 and 22, and the central clambers 23 and 24, respectively communicating with fitting 27 for the inflow of the water to be filtered and with fitting 28 for the filtered water outflow . As it clearly appears from fig. 3, the cen tral duct 29 of the distributor communicates with the parallel duct at its side 26, by means of the transversal offtake 30.When the knob is in the opened position, the communication 38 between chambers 23 and 24 is closed and, therefore, the water to filter . ows from fitting 27, gets into chamber 23 and, Through chamber 19, passes into duct 25 of the distributor communicating with chamber 32 of glass 11 surrounding the filtering cartridge. After having passed thrc the fil ter, the water flows into duct 29 of the distributor and, through off take 30, into duct 26. This last one ends in chamber 20 and,consequent ly, the filtered water passes into the side chamber 24 and then comes out from fitting 28.The water run is shown in fig. 1 with lines 33, 34, 34 , 35, 36, 37. If the filtering action is wished to be interrupted, one has but to shift knob 17 into the closing position to put the drawer er valve into such a position to shut the communications 39 between chambers 19 and 26, the canonication 40 between chambers 24 and 20, and to open the communication 38 between chambers 23 and 24. Therefore, the water to filter which flows from 27 passing through 2he bers 23 and 24, gets out directly into fitting 28 without passing through the fil ter. The water run, in this case, is shown in fig. 1 with the lines 33, 41,37 . Filter 10 Fig. 4 substantially consists like the previous one, but with distributor 42 fitted with a side duct 43 for the inflow into the glass chamber corresponding to duct 25 of the first distribubor, with the following differences. Side duct 44 connects ehmber 22 of valve body 18 with fitting 45 for inflow. Central duct 46 connects the central part of the filter with the outflow fitting 47. Fittings 45 and 47. are apt for connection respectively with the outflow and inflow openings of a water treatment apparatus as cleaner 48 of fig. 7.The water flows from fitting 27, passes into chambers 23 and 19 of the valve body and, therefore, into duct 43 of the distributor Fig. 5 from which it gets into the glass lodging the filter. The filtered water passes from the filter into the central duct 46 of the distributor and, through offtake 48, flows out into fitting 47 connecting it with the cleaner entrance. E e water cleaned in this last device returns into the distributor by means of fitting 45 Fig. 5 . Frown this fitting it flows into duct 44 and, consequently, into chamber 20 of the valve body and, pouring into chamber 24, it flows out fran the head fitting 28.The water run towards the depurator is shown in fig. 4 by lines 52,53, 53 , 54, 55, 56 and the one of the depurated water by lines 57, 58, 59. It is obviously always possible to canpletely cut out the filter and the depurator thus obtaining the direct connection of fittings 27 and 28 through clem ers 23 and 24 of valve body 16 by shifting the drawer valve, as already stated in the description of the first type.In fig. 4 the mixer 60 can be seen, which is further illustrated by the longitudinal section Fig. 6 . It consists of a parallelopiped including two ducts 61 and 62 communicating respectively with the special bores foreseen for this purpose in fittings 27 and 28 Fig. 2 of the head. These ducts are transversally connected by conical offtake 63. The outflow opening of the cone can be reduced at wish by means of pin 67 of valve 66 which can be slide axially if turned on its axle 68.The not filtered water enters in circulation of the soft water through offtake 63 with a delivery in accordance with the pressure of the fluid. This delivery can be regulated at wish by acting ore the pin valve 66. With a very simple and quick operation, the filter can be engaged and disengaged at will. Only by replacing the distributor, the filter can be used either inde pendently or in connection with a water treatment device, as a cleaner or onother. The fittings for the connection to the dust of the water to filter and of the filtered one are set traversaIIy in order to facilitate and siplify in a considerable way their setting on the installations. According to the need, the installation can be equipped with a water running sense from the right to the left or in oontnary sense. Any complicated set of valves and fittings, generally necessary trfien setting up the conventional filters, is Thus eliminated. Estrenely easy cleaning and replacement of the filter cartridges.
