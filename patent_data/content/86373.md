# Magneto optical converter.

## Abstract
A magneto optical converter utilizing the Faraday effect is disposed between the opposed ends of an iron core 11 having a magnetic field extending therebetween. The magneto optical converter 1 is comprised of a body of material exhibiting the Faraday effect which is provided with a light receiving surface and a light exiting surface. A po larizer 7 in the form of a polarizing beam splitter is located adjacent the light receiving surface whereby an incident beam of light perpendicular to the magnetic field will be deflected and polarized at right angles to the incident beam of light and directed into the receiving surface of the body of material. An analyzer 8 comprised of a polarizing beam splitter is located adjacent the light exiting surface whereby the beam of light from the body of material will be deflected and polarized and exit the analyzer at right angles to the magnetic field. The receiving and exiting surfaces of the body material may be bevelled and optical rotators may be disposed intermediate the bevelled surfaces and the po larizer and the analyzer respectively.
