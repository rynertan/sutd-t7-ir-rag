## Description
Optically readable information disk and method of manufacturing same. The invention relates to an optically readable information disk having an optically readable information track of information areas situated alternately at a higher level and at a lower level and comprising a substrate which has a metal layer on at least one side. The information track is read in reflection by means of laser light. The difference in height between the areas is 4 d, wherein is the wavelength of the reading laser light and ri is the refractive index. In practice the difference in height is 0.1 0.2 um. The longitudinal dimensions of the areas vary between approximately 0.3 and 3 um. Such an information disk is known under the tradename Laser Vision as regerds video disks and under the tradename Compact Disk as regards audio disks. The substrate is manufactured from a synthetic resin, for example, polycarbonate or polymethyl methacrylate. Such disks are manufactured by means of, for example, an injection moulding process in which the warm, liquid synthetic resin is compressed in a mould in which one or more matrices are provided. The surface of one or more matrices comprises an information track which is the negative of the desired information track on the information disk. The information disks thus obtained which comprise an information track usually on one side but possibly on both sides, are then provided with a metal layer on the side of the information track. The metal layer is usually provided by means of a vapour deposition process or a sputtering process or by an electroless chemical metallisation process, as described for example, in theTechnical Proceedings of the American Electroplaters Society, 14 18 June, St. Louis, 1964, EE 139 149. Another method which so far has not yet been used in practice is known from Japanese Patent Application Publication J 83053 411. According to this process also, an information track is provided in a synthetic resin substrate which, however, has previously been provided on one side with a thin metal layer. The information track is provided by means of a compression process in which a socalled stamper compression die is used, the surface of which comprises an information track which is the negative of the desired information track on the information disk. The first mentioned injection moulding process is a rather expensive process, also due to the vapourdeposited metal layer. Adherency problems of the metal layer to the resin may arise. The resulting disks generally are of a good quality, but expensive. The above described compression process enables cheap disks to be manufactured. The quality of the disks is less good. The quality of the stored information deteriorates rapidly, so that upon reproduction a significant loss of quality is observed. It is the object of the present invention to provide an information disk which is cheap to manufacture and which has a permanent good quality of the stored information. This object is achieved by means of an optically readable information disk of the type mentioned in the opening paragraph which is characterized in that the information track is present only in the metal layer, the surface of the substrate adjoining the metal layer having a flat structure. The substrate may be manufactured either from an inorganic material or from an organic material. Examples of suitable inorganic substrates are metal plates, for example, an Al plate having a thickness of, for example, 1 mm, plates of glass, ceramics, oxides, for example, Al203, andSi wafers. The substrate is preferably manufactured from a synthetic resin. Suitable synthetic resins are polyesters, for example, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, polyethylene, prolypropylene, polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyvinyl chloride. In a preferred embodiment of the information disk according to the invention, a synthetic resin substrate is used which has a soft metal layer on at least one side. As soft metals within the scope of the invention may be mentioned In, Pb, Zn, Cu, Ag, Au and alloys thereof.The metal must have a hardness which is lower than that of galvanic nickel. In a further preferred form of the information disk, the synthetic resin substrate comprises on at least one side an electrolessly deposited metal layer which is covered by an electroplated layer of a soft metal. Particularly good results are achieved notably with an information disk the synthetic resin substrate of which is a foil which on at least one side has an electrolessly deposited layer of Ag, Ni or Cu covered with an electroplated layer of In or a Pb Sn alloy. The synthetic resin foil preferably has a good surface quality, in particular a good smoothness. The thickness of the foil is approximately 200 um. As said hereabove the first metal layer of Ag, Ni or Cu is electrolessly deposited, for example, by means of an electroless chemical deposition process in which the foil, after a pretreatment with, for example, tannin and stannous chloride, is treated with an aqueous solution of an Ag, Ni or Cu salt, for example, silver nitrate and an aqueous solution of a reducing agent, for example, glucose. The first metal layer is a very good electrical conductor so that the second metal layer can be provided electrolytically. The use of a Pb Sn alloy has the advantage that this material does not adhere to the die with which the information track is compressed into the metal layer. No die contamination occurs, which occurs to some extent with the pure metals Pb and Sn. Another advantage is that very smooth surfaces are obtained at low current densities with the Pb Sn alloys. A further advantage is that the smooth and flat Pb Sn layer is sufficiently soft to compress information therein under mild conditions. The thickness of the Pb Sn layer is approximately 1 um. In a further favourable embodiment the metal layer is covered with a protecting lacquer which in turn is covered with a synthetic resin foil which, if so desired, can be removed when the disk is used. The invention also relates to a method of manufactuering optically readable information disks according to the invention, which is characterized in that a stripshaped substrate which has a metal layer on one or both main surfaces is guided into a press or between a pair of rollers. a die of the press or the surface of one of the rollers bearing a pattern in the form of a negative of the desired information track, the information track is formed only in the metal layer of the substrate by compression or by rollers, at least the exposed surface of the part of the metal layer comprising the information track is provided with a transparent protective layer of a synthetic resin, and the information disk is separated from the remainder of the substrate strip by cutting outside the circumference of the information track present in the metal layer, amd optionally a hole is punched in the centre of the substrate portion provided with the information track, In a favourable embodiment of the method reference holes are provided on the sides of the substrate, with which holes the substrate can be exactly positioned. The invention will described in greater detail by means of the drawings, in which Figure 1 is a cross sectional view of the optically readable information track according to the invention, as well as the device for the manufacture thereof, and Figure 2 is an elevation of a diagrammatic production line for the manufacture of optically readable information disks according to the invention. Reference numeral 1 in Figure 1 denotes one press half which has a die 2 manufactured, for example, from Ni.Die 2 has an information track 3 comprising information areas situated alternately at a higher level 4 and at a lower level 5. The information areas have small dimensions.The longitudinal dimensions vary in accordance with the stored information and are from approximately 0.3 to approximately 3 um. The difference in height of the areas is between 0.1 and 0.2 um. The information track 3 is the negative of the desired information track in the optically readable information track to be manufactured. A synthetic resin foil 6 of polyester comprises a metal layer 7 on one side. The metal layer may be manufactured from, for example, In, Ag, Sn, Pb, Cu, Al. The metal layer preferably comprises a Pb Sn alloy. The metal layer is obtained by first providing the foil with an electrolessly deposited Ag layer, for example, by using the chemical metallisation process known per se. A Pb Sn layer in a thickness of 1 um is provided on the layer of Ag by electroplating. The resulting Pb Sn layer has a smooth surface.It is possible in principle to provide the metal layer 7, for example, a Pb Sn layer, on the foil 6 by using a vapour deposition process or a sputtering process. With a layer thickness of 1 um the duration of the process is very long so that the abo e described, electroless chemical process is to be preferred. Press 1 with die 2 is pressed on the metal layer 2 7 with a pressure of 50 200 N mm . As a result of this, an information track 8 is formed in the metal layer 7, which track is the negative of the information track 3. The information track 8 is present only in layer 7, the interface 9 of foil 7 and foil 6 remaining entirely flat. Track 8 comprises optically readable information areas alternately at a higher level 10 and at a lower level 11. Reference numeral 12 in Figure 2 denotes a supply reel for foil 13. Foil 13 comprises a metal layer, not shown, quite in accordance with Figure 1, lowest drawing. The metal layer as shown in Figure 2 is present on the top side. Foil 13 is moved discontinuously from supply reel 12, via guide rollers 14, to a winding reel 15. The discontinuous movement is carried out by the transporting mechanism, referenced diagrammatically 16, which for this purpose comprises a carriage 18 which is movable along a rod 17 and is provided with retractable pins not shown arranged to fit in the reference holes 19 provided along the side edges of foil 13. After unwinding from the storage reel 12, the foil 13, passes through a cutting bonding device 20 with which, when a new roll of foil is inserted, the ends thereof are cut off exactly and are bonded together with overlap. Foil 13 is provided adjacent to both edges with reference holes 19 which serve for an exact positioning of the foil during the various treatments, for example, pressing of information, providing protecting lacquer, making a central hole and punching. For this purpose, positioning pins, as referenced 21, which cooperate with reference holes 19 are provided regularly in the production line. These reference holes 19 are provided by a hole punching machine 22. An optically readable spiral like information track is pressed in the metal layer of the foil 13 by means of a press 23, quite in conformity with the method shown in Figure 1.Press 23 comprises a frame 24 and two press halves 25 and 26, respectively. The top press half 25 comprises a matrix 27, as is shown in Figure 1, which comprises a spiral like information track 3 see Figure 1 . A circular area in the metal surface of the foil 13 which is thus provided with information, which foil part will hereinafter also be referred to as the information part, is referenced 28. A U.V. light curable lacquer supplied from a lacquer reservoir 30 is then provided over information part 28 by means of a rake 29. The protectuve lacquer is cured with UV light originating from lamp 31. A further protective layer is provided in the form of a foil 32 which is unwound from storage reel 33 via guide rollers 34 and is bounded to foil 13 by means of a pressure roller 35. The foil 32 may for this purpose be provided on one side with a layer of glue. The foil is transported via tensioning roller 36 to cutting cylinder 38 with which a central hole 37 is punched.Foil 13 is then cut through outside the circumference of the information part 28 by means of a cutting cylinder 38 and the resulting information disk 40 is received on a tube 41. The remainder of the foil now comprises holes 42 is wound on winding reel 15.
