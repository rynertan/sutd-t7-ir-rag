## Description
This invention relates to a heat recoverable termination device and, more particularly, to a heat recoverable termination device having a heat recoverable insert therein for additional strength and wire alignment. In Wetmore U.S. Patent No. 3,243,211, several types of novel connectors are disclosed. Electrical connectors according to the Wetmore patent, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein, include a dimensionally heatunstable member such as a sleeve in which is placed a ring or ball shaped solder insert. In a typical connector of this type, both ends of the member or sleeve are open to receive the electrical conductors that are to be connected. The connector is then heated, causing the member or sleeve to shrink and firmly grip the conductors. The heat also causes the solder to flow and form a soldered connection between the two electrical conductors. The sleeve acts to contain the movement of the solder so that a good soldered joint is assured. In general, such members or sleeves are made of a material capable of having the property of plastic or elastic memory imparted thereto and are expanded under heat and presure to a diameter greater than their normal diameter and cooled while under pressure. A sleeve treated in this manner will retain its expanded position until it is again heated to above its heat recovery temperature at which time it will recover to its original shape. Examples of material useful in forming such dimensionally heat unstable recoverable members may be found in Currie U.S. Patent No. 2,027,962 and Cook et al. Patent No. 3,086,242, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Polymeric materials which have been cross linked by chemical means or by irradiation, for example, with high energy electrons or nuclear radiation, such as those disclosed in the Cook et al. patent, are preferred for use in the present invention. Noncrystalline polymeric materials exhibiting the property of plastic or elastic memory, such as polyurethane, inomers, etc, could also be used in practicing the present invention. The connector of the present invention is equally useful with sleeves made from materials having either plastic or elastic memory consequently, as used herein, the terms elastic memory and plastic memory are used interchangeably and are intended to be mutually inclusive. French Patent No. 2,015,723 discloses a method of causing heat recoverable articles to recover, by constructing the articles from polymeric material containing conductive particles, such as carbon black. Heat recoverable articles made from this type of material can be made to recover by passing an electric current through them, the resistance heating of the conductive particles generating sufficient heat to cause the articles to recover. The patent discloses several articles which utilize this method, all of which are tubular members or sleeves. For example, one article comprises a heat recoverable sleeve containg conductive particles, which is located between two other heat recoverable sleeves which do not contain conductive particles . Electrical heating of the intermediate sleeve causes all three sleeves any of which may be fusible at the recovery temperature to recover. Recoverable members or sleeves of this type are extremely useful in the making of insulated soldered connections between electrical conductors such as between a terminal on a piece of electrical apparatus and a wire, or between two wires. Generally, this is accomplished by providing the recoverable sleeve with an internal ring of solder, passing the electrical conductors into the two ends of the sleeves until the conductive portions of the conductors are located within the solder ring, and heating the assembly so that the sleeve tries to recover to its original shape and the solder melts and joins the two conductors. The result is a good electrical connection which is insulated and protected by the sleeve. In Ellis Patent No. 3,525,799, which is incorporated herein by reference, there are disclosed fusible inserts, other than solder, for sealing a connector so as to prevent extrusion of the melted solder and also for properly locating a conductor. As disclosed therein, these fusible inserts are generally made from any material that is capable of being rendered flowable by the application of heat. However, preferred materials are thermoplastic materials such as polyolefins, polyamides and polyesters. It has been found that under certain circumstances the Wetmore and Ellis devices have insufficient mechanical strength to properly maintain alignment of the conductor and, for example, a terminator such as a mass termination connector MTC wafer terminator. An MTC wafer terminator is a termination device employed by Raychem Corporation. However, the problem of aligning the conductor and this particular terminator is common to many other types of devices as well. If there is insufficient alignment of the conductor and terminator, it is very likely that a poor electrical connection will result. It would thus be desirable to have a termination device that has sufficient strength to properly align electrical components so as to maintain good electrical contact. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to have a termination device with sufficient strength so as to properly align electrical components and maintain good electrical contact. This and other objects of the invention will become more apparent after reference to the following description, considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. There is disclosed according to the invention a termination device comprising a dimensionally heat unstable tubular member having a wall, a fusible insert, and a dimensionally heat unstable insert. The fusible insert and the dimensionally heat unstable insert are positioned within the tubular member and in abutting relationship with the wall of the tubular member. The fusible insert is meltable and the dimensionally heat unstable insert is recoverable at a temperature used to recover the tubular member. It has been found that the performance of the termination device is markedly enhanced by the presence of the dimensionally heat unstable insert which adds mechanical strength to the termination device. The fusible insert or inserts may be solder, a thermoplastic polymeric material, or both. It is preferred that the fusible insert or inserts melt or flow at the temperature required to recover the tubular member. Figure 1 is an end view of the termination device according to the invention. Figure 2 is a sectional view of the termination device according to the invention in the direction of arrows II II of Figure 1. Figure 3 is a perspective view of the termination device according to the invention in a proposed method of use. Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of the termination device according to the invention in the direction of arrows IV IV of Figure 3. In a further aspect of the invention, there is disclosed according to the invention a termination device comprising a dimensionally heat unstable tubular member having a wall, a polymeric fusible insert, a metallic fusible insert, and a dimensionally heat unstable insert. The polymeric fusible insert is positioned proximate to an end of the tubular member and in abutting relationship with the wall of the tubular member. The metallic fusible insert and the dimensionally heat unstable insert are positioned generally centrally within the tubular member and in abutting relationship with the wall of the tubular member. The fusible inserts are meltable and the dimensionally heat unstable insert is recoverable at a temperature used to recover the tubular member. Referring to the figures in more detail, and particularly referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown the termination device according to the invention generally indicated by 2. The termination device comprises a dimensionally heat unstable tubular member 4 having a wall 6. The dimensionally heat unstable insert 8 is positioned within the tubular member and is in abutting relationship 10 with the wall 6 of the tubular member. The term dimensionally heat unstable refers to the property of certain materials as having plastic or elastic memory. That is, these materials have a shape which is unstable at higher temperatures so that when these materials are exposed to this higher temperature, called its recovery temperature, these materials will return to their heat stable shape. These materials are commonly called recoverable materials. The tubular member and the dimensionally heat unstable insert each have a predetermined longitudinal dimension. And as can be seen, particularly in Figure 2, the longitudinal dimension of the tubular member is substantially larger than the longitudinal dimension of the insert. The termination device also includes at least one fusible insert. The fusible insert or inserts is positioned within the tubular member and in abutting relationship with the wall of the tubular member. The fusible insert or inserts is meltable at the temperature used to recover the tubular member. The fusible insert or inserts may be made from a thermoplastic polymeric material or solder. If there is only one fusible insert, it will preferably be solder however, it is also within the scope of the invention for the one fusible insert to be a thermoplastic polymeric material. Normally, however, there will be more than one fusible insert. In this case, the fusible inserts will include a single solder insert for ensuring good electrical contact and at least one, and usually two, inserts of the thermoplastic polymeric material for providing sealing. The most preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figure 2. The thermoplastic polymeric inserts 14, 16 are positioned proximate to an end 20, 22, respectively, of the tubular member. The thermoplastic polymeric inserts are in abutting relationship 24, 26, respectively, with the wall of the tubular member. The metallic fusible insert 18 the solder and the dimensionally heat unstable insert 8 are positioned generally centrally within the tubular member indicated by 30 and in abutting relationship 28, 10, respectively, with the wall of the tubular member. It should be understood that the dimensionally heat unstable insert and the solder do not need to be exactly centered within the termination device but only within the central portion as encompassed by the polymeric inserts. It is preferred that the dimensionally heat unstable insert be made from a polymeric material. The preferred polymeric materials are poly aryl ether ketone or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE having a molecular weight greater than about 3,000,000. Poly aryl ether ketones suitable for use in this invention have the repeat units of the formula Preferably, Ar and Ar are independently selected from substituted and unsubstituted phenylene and substituted and unsubstituted polynuclear aromatic moieties. The term polynuclear aromatic moieties is used to mean aromatic moieties containing at least two aromatic rings. The rings can be fused, joined by a direct bond or by a linking group. Such linking groups include for example, carbonyl, ether sulfone, sulfide, amide, imide, azo, alkylene, perfluoro alkylene and the like. As mentioned above, at least one of Ar and Ar contains a diaryl ether linkage. The phenylene and polynuclear aromatic moieties can contain substituents on the aromatic rings. These substituents should not inhibit or otherwise interfere with the polymerization reaction to any significant extent. Such substituents include, for example, phenyl, halogen, nitro, cyano, alkyl, 2 alkynyl and the like. Poly aryl ether ketones having the following repeat units the simplest repeat unit being designated for a given polymer are preferred Poly aryl ether ketones can be prepared by known methods of synthesis. Preferred poly aryl ether ketones can be prepared by Friedel Crafts polymerization of a monomer system comprising The aromatic diacid dihalide employed is preferably a dichloride or dibromide. Illustrative diacid dihalides which can be used include, for example wherein a is 0 4. Illustrated polynuclear aromatic comonomers which can be used with such diacid halides are and where k 1 In monomer system III, the acid halide is of the formula It is to be understood that combinations of monomers can be employed. For example, one or more diacid dihalides can be used with one or more polynuclear aromatic comonomers as long as the correct stoichiometry is maintained. Further, one or more acid halides can be included. In addition monomers which contain other linkages such as those specified above, can be employed as long a one or more of the comonomers used contains at least one ether oxygen linkage. Such comonomers include for example which can be used as the sole comonomer with an ether containing diacid dihalide or with phosgene or any diacid dihalide when used in addition to a polynuclear aromatic comonomer as defined in I ii a , I ii b , I ii c or I ii d . Similarly can be used as a comonomer together with an ether containing polynuclear aromatic acid halide or as an additional comonomer together with a monomer system as defined in I. The monomer system can also contain up to about 30 mole of a comonomer such as a sulfonyl chloride which polymerizes under Friedel Crafts conditions to provide ketone sulfone copolymers. Further details of this process for producing poly aryl ether ketones can be found in commonly assigned co pending U.S. application Serial No. 594,503, filed 31 March 1984, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other processes for preparing these polymers can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,953,400, 3,956,240, 3,928,295, 4,108,837, 4,176,222 and 4,320,224. The ultra high molecular weight polyethylenes suitable for use in this invention are disclosed in U.S. patent application serial no. 582,105 filed Feb. 21, 1984 entitled Recoverable Polyethylene composition and Article, which is incorporated herein by reference. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the dimensionally heat unstable insert may comprise either poly aryl ether ketone or UHMWPE loaded with tin. Another preferred embodiment is for the dimensionally heat unstable insert to comprise either poly aryl ether ketone or UHMWPE with a layer of tin or solder on a surface of the material which is not in abutting relationship with the wall of the tubular member. That is, referring to Figure 2, the dimensionally heat unstable insert 8 may have a layer of tin or solder on surface 12 which faces toward the interior of the termination device and also faces in the direction of recovery of the termination device. When the dimensionally heat unstable insert contains tin or is plated with tin or solder, it is expected that the insert will be at least partially fusible. However, the insert will nevertheless retain its property of being dimensionally heat unstable. It is also contemplated within the scope of the invention that when the dimensionally heat unstable insert contains tin or is plated with tin or solder, the dimensionally heat unstable insert simultaneously provides the compressive force necessary to hold the electrical contacts together while also fusing the electrical contacts, thereby providing a good electrical connection so that a separate solder insert may become unnecessary. Referring now to Figure 3, there is shown the termination device used in one proposed environment. As shown in the figure, it is desired to join a wire 40 and an MTC wafer terminator 50. The wafer has tabs 52, a slightly enlarged portion 54 and electrical contacts 56. The problem in the past has always been to properly align the stripped portion 42 of the wire 40 with the tab 52 of the wafer 50. When the stripped portion of the wire and the tab are not properly aligned, there is, of course, improper electrical connection. As shown in Figure 4, the recovered termination device 2 has properly located the stripped portion 42 of the wire onto the tab 52. The dimensionally heat unstable insert provides the mechanical strength necessary to hold the stripped portion of the wire to the tab while the metallic fusible insert fuses and provides the required electrical connection between the stripped portion of the wire and the wafer tab. Polymeric fusible inserts 14, 16 complete the termination by sealing the ends of the termination device so as to provide an environmentally secure termination device as well as to prevent the solder from squeezing out through the ends. As stated before, it is possible that when the dimensionally heat unstable insert is loaded with tin or is plated with tin or solder, the fusible insert may possibly be dispensed with, if desired. Tests were performed to determine the mechanical strength of a presently used termination device and termination devices prepared according to the invention. The presently used termination device included a dimensionally heat unstable tubular member, polymeric fusible inserts at either end of the tubular member, and a solder insert near the center of the tubular member. This termination device is similar to the termination device shown in Figure 2 except this termination device did not include the dimensionally heat unstable insert 8. Against this termination device, termination devices according to the invention were prepared which did include the dimensionally heat unstable insert. In the termination devices according to the invention, the dimensionally heat unstable insert was either made from a poly aryl ether ketone or an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene. The termination devices were further prepared by inserting electrical conductors in either end of the termination devices so as to form an electrical connection. Several termination devices of each type were prepared in this manner. The terminated termination devices were then placed in an Instron Tensile Testing Machine and the electical conductors pulled so as to determine the tensile strength of each termination device. The presently used termination device had a tensile strength which varied over several samples from zero to 15.42 kilograms 34 pounds . The termination device according to the invention, having the dimensionally heat unstable insert which was made of the poly aryl ether ketone , had a tensile strength which was consistently in the range of 15.20 to 15.88 kilograms 33½ to 35 pounds . The other termination device according to the invention, which had a dimensionally heat unstable insert made from ultra high molecular weight polyethylene had a tensile strength which was consistently in the range of 17.92 to 18.37 kilograms 39½ to 40½ pounds . Thus, it can be appreciated that the termination devices according to the invention, containing a dimensionally heat unstable insert made from either poly aryl ether ketone or ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, exhibited superior mechanical strength and clearly out performed the presently used termination device.
