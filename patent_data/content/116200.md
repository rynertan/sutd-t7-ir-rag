# Polyphenylene ether resin compositions.

## Abstract
A composition comprises 100 wt. parts of a polypheny lene ether, optionally with other polymer substances, and 0.1 to 20 wt. parts of a bicyclophosphoric ester compound of formula Optional other polymers include polymers of styrene, rubbers and thermoplastic polymers, including graft polym ers. Fillers may be present. The components can be blended in an extruder or plast mill. The composition has improved flame retardance with out reduction of the inherent heat resistance of the polyphenylene ether.
