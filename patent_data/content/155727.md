# Electrochemical reference electrode.

## Abstract
An electrochemical reference electrode having improved potential stability is provided, such reference electrode being suitable for use as a second order or half cell component within a system for measuring the ion concentration of body liquids. The reference electrode includes an electrode of the metal metal cation type in association with an electrolyte that includes a soluble salt of the metal cation of the electrode, which soluble salt is present within the electrolyte in an amount sufficient to have metal cation present in the electrolyte at its saturation concentration.
