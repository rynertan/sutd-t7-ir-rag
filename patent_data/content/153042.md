# Foamable hot melt polymer compositions.

## Abstract
Hot melt compositions are disclosed from which foamed products having a fine and uniform void structure therein can be obtained. The compositions include a thermoplastic poly mer preferably an elastomer such as a styrene butadiene block copolymer, and a small amount of a salt of a sulfonated styrene polymer. Plasticising processing aids, tackifying agents and antioxidants can be included in the compositions, as well as in addition surfactants such as dodecylbenzene sulfonate. The composition can be mixed with gaseous blowing agents by suitable means and dispensed to produce foamed products suited for example as sealants in closures for containers.
