# Tris aryl alkyl phosphonium compounds and compositions containing the same.

## Abstract
Tri phenyl alkyl phosphonium halides wherein the phenyl groups contain a long chain or sterically hindered alkyl group and exhibiting efficacious levels of fungicidal, insecticidal and bacteriocidal activity are disclosed. The presence of the alkyl substituent eliminated or significantly reduces the phytotoxicity that characterizes the corresponding unsubstituted phosphonium compounds. The said phosphonium halides are also useful for treatment of fabrics to combat mildew.
