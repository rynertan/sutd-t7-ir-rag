# CONTAINERS MADE FROM POLYSTYRENE FOAMS CONTAININ POLYETHYLENE

## Abstract
The impact strength of containers made from foams of aromatic olefins such as polystyrene and poly para methyl styrene is improved by the addition of a small amount e.g., 2 to 25 weight percent of a polyethylene such as linear low density polyethylene. Meat trays made of such foams can be pro cessed in automatic packaging equipment and exhibit reduced damage, such as cracking, in processing.
