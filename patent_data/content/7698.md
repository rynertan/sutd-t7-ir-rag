# Method and system for scintillation camera uniformity correction.

## Abstract
A two stage system for enhancing the imaging unifor mity of a scintillation camera detects radiation events and produces radiation count signals indicating the location and energy level of individual detected radiation events. The uniformity correction system compensates for imprecision in the camera s indication of both radiation event location and energy level. Compensation for energy indication errors is done by a first stage, prior to a second stage correction for errors in event location indications. The operations of both stages are carried out in real time for each individual radiation count, independently of the production of other counts. The first stage locates and stores the peak of detected energy pulse height distribution for each of a plurality of regions in the camera s field of view. This regional profile of the cam era s energy response characteristic is used to synchronously align a pulse height energy window of the camera imaging circuitry with a series of pulse height distribution peaks respectively corresponding to the regional locations of each of a series of radiation counts. The second uniformity correc tion stage, a flood correction circuit, produces and stores a profile of the camera s regional variations in sensitivity in response to uniform radiation flux over its field. This stored information is used for calculating sensitivity correction fac tors for several regions of the field. The correction factors are used for controlling the ratio of radiation counts correspond ing to each region which are actuallv imaged, thus effectively equalizing camera sensitivity over its field.
