# Noise removing apparatus in an FM receiver.

## Abstract
A noise removing apparatus in an FM receiver includes a high pass filter 29 receiving an output from an FM detector circuit 11 , a gate 15 being interrupted in response to a pulsive noise detected by level discriminating an output from a variable gain amplifier 35 receiving an output from the high pass filter 29 . Transistors are provided for controll ing the gain of the variable gain amplifier 35 according to the magnitude of a terminal voltage of a capacitor which is charged according to an output from a rectifying circuit 43 . The noise removing apparatus further includes a voltage generator 51 for generating a voltage proportional to a received electric field strength and a circuit 53 for varying an amount to be charged in the capacitor according to the magnitude of a voltage from the voltage generator 51 for maintaining the gain of the variable gain amplifier 35 large at the time of strong electric field, so that a multipath noise can be effectively removed.
