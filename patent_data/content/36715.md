## Description
CATALYST FOR DIACYLOXYLATION OF CONJUGATED DIENES This invention relates to a catalyst for diacyloxylation of conjugated dienes, and more particularly to a solid catalyst for use in the manufacture of diacyloxyalkenes by reacting conjugated dienes, carboxylic acids and oxygen. The catalyst includes a carrier supporting at least one noble metal of Group VIII and at least oneGroup IV, V or VI element, excluding those in the second period. Diacyloxyalkenes are useful as raw materials for a variety of industrial applications. For example, 1,4 butane diol derived from 1,4 diacyloxybutene 2 is an industrially useful compound serving as a solvent, or an intermediate for the manufacture of tetrahydrofuran, y butyrolactone, polyesters, or the like. It is known to manufacture diacyloxyalkenes by reacting a conjugated diene, a carboxylic acid and oxygen in the presence of a palladium catalyst, and various methods have hitherto been proposed for that purpose.For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Specification No. 72090 1973 discloses a method which employs a solid catalyst containing at least one metal selected from among palladium, tellurium and selenium, and No.96513 1973 discloses a method which employs a solid catalyst containing at least one metal selected from among palladium, antimony and bismuth, and at least one selected from between tellurium and selenium. In order to improve the activity of these solid catalysts, it has been proposed to prepare such a solid catalyst be using an activated carbon carrier treated with nitric acid as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid Open SpecificationNo. 11812 1974. For the same purpose, it has also been proposed to use a solid catalyst after reducing it, treating it with a gas containing molecular oxygen at a temp erature of at least 200 C., and reducing it again, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 12686 1977.There has also been developed a method employing a solid catalyst composed of three catalytic components, i.e., palladium, tellurium and at least one metal selected from among tin, germanium and lead, and having a high catalytic activity, as disclosed in U S. Patent No. 4,225,727 granted September 30, 1980. The aforementioned methods employing solid catalysts have the drawback that they undergo a marked reduction of catalytic activity with the lapse of time, although they show high activity and selectivity during an initial period of use. In order to prevent such reduction of activity with the lapse of time, it has been proposed to control the quantity of vinylcyclohexene in butadiene, formic acid in acetic acid, or like impurities, and incorporate a polymerization inhibitor into a reaction system for the manufacture of diacyloxyalkenes in the presence of a known solid catalyst Japanese Patent Publication No. 15491 1978 , and incorporate elemental sulfur as a degradation inhibitor Japanese Patent ApplicationLaid Open Specification No. 51313 1977 .Although these proposals have considerably improved the solid catalysts known in the art, all of the known catalysts still have a half life of activity which is not longer than 1,000 hours, and are difficult to apply for satisfactory use on an industrial basis. It has also been proposed, as disclosed inJapanese Patent Application Laid Open Specification No.103509 1973, to provide a catalyst maintaining a high activity by using instead of an activated carbon carrier alumina, silica, silica alumina or titania in which pores having a diameter of at least 1,000 occupy at least 80 of the total pore volume. No such carrier is, however, suitable for practical use, since any catalyst prepared by using it has a by far lower activity than any prior catalyst having an activated carbon carrier. Applicants have now found that a catalyst prepared by using, as a carrier, silica having a specific pore structure can maintain a high activity for an extremely long period of time. This invention thus provides an improvement in the catalyst for diacyloxylation of conjugated dienes, the catalyst including a carrier supporting thereon at least one noble metal belonging to Group VIII of the periodic table, and at least one element belonging toGroups IV, V or VI, particularly Groups IVA, VA and VIA of the Fisher Scientific Company periodic table, but excluding those of the second period , wherein the carrier comprises silica having Åa specific surface area of at 2 least 200 m g, and an average pore diameter of at least 100 A. The use of a silica having a specific surface 2 area of less than 200 m g results in a catalyst having a low activity, even if it has an average pore diameter of at least 100 A. Likewise, the use of any silica having an average pore diameter which is smaller than 100 A results in a catalyst having a low level of activity which undergoes a sharp reduction with the lapse of time, 2 even if it has a specific surface area of at least 200 m2 g. It is thus imperative to use silica which satisfies both of the requirements. Preferably, the catalyst of this invention is prepared by using silica having a specific 2 surface area of 250 to 1,000 m g, and an average pore diameter of 100 to 500 A. For the purpose of this invention, the surface area of the silica has been calculated from the quantity of the nitrogen adsorbed by the silica at the liquid nitrogen temperature as obtained in accordance with theBET adsorption isotherm, and the average pore diameter of the silica has been obtained from the nitrogen desorption curve at the liquid nitrogen temperature in accordance with the BJH method. The silica which is used for this invention may contain a maximum of 5 by weight of alumina, titania, zirconia, or like metal oxides, carbon or the like. The silica having the aforementioned pore structure may be either prepared by a customary method, or obtained from a source of commercial supply. Although the silica may be used as it is, it is more desirable to use it after heat treating it at a temperature of at least 1000C., preferably 1000C to 5000C and most preferably 1200C to 5000C, for 0.5 to 3 hours in air. Any higher temperature should be avoided, since the preferred pore structure is likely to be destroyed. This invention provides a solid catalyst comprising the silica having the aforementioned structure, on which particular catalytic components are supported.The catalytic components comprise at least one noble metal selected from Group VIII of the periodic table, and at least one element selected from Groups IV, V and VI of the periodic table excluding those of the second period . The noble metals belonging to Group VIII of the periodic table include palladium, platinum, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium. It is preferred to use palladium or platinum, and palladium is most preferred. The elements of Groups IV, V and VI of the periodic table excluding those of the second period mean those of GroupsIV, V and VI excluding carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Tellurium, selenium, sulfur, antimony, bismuth, germanium, tin, and lead are preferred and the use of tellurium, tin, germanium or lead is particularly preferred. The catalyst of this invention preferably employs a combination of palladium and tellurium on the silica carrier, and more preferably, a combination of palladium and tellurium with tin, germanium or selenium.It is worthy of particular mention that the catalyst comprising a combination of palladium and tellurium with tin, germanium or selenium can maintain a very high level of activity for a very long period of time. When the aforementioned noble metal and element are applied to the silica carrier, they are usually used in the form of a compound which is soluble in water or an organic solvent, e.g., an inorganic salt such as a halide, nitrate, sulfate or carbonate, or an organic salt such as an acetate, oxalate or amine salt. It is, however, equally possible to use the element per se, or an element or a compound thereof, such as an oxide, in the form of a solution in a mixture of an organic solvent and a mineral acid. It is possible to use, for example, the compounds of the Group VIII noble metals and the Group IVA,VA and VIA elements which will hereunder be mentioned.Examples of the palladium compounds which can be used include palladium chloride, palladium sulfate, palladium nitrate and palladium oxide examples of the platinum compounds include platinum dichloride, platinum tetrachloride, chloroplatinic acid and platinum oxide, and examples of the ruthenium compounds include ruthenium oxide, ruthenium dichloride, ruthenium tetrachloride and ruthenium hydroxide. Examples of the rhodium compounds include rhodium chloride examples of the osmium compounds include osmium tetrachloride, and examples of the iridium compounds include iridium tetrachloride and potassium iridate.Examples of the tellurium compounds include tellurium tetrachloride and tellurium dichloride examples of the selenium compounds include selenic acid and selenium dioxide, and examples of the antimony compounds include antimony trichloride and antimony pentachloride. Examples of the bismuth compounds include bismuth chloride and bismuth oxychloride examples of the germanium compounds include germanium tetrachloride examples of the tin compounds include tin dichloride tin tetrachloride and tin acetate, and examples of the lead compounds include lead dichloride, lead chlorate and lead acetate. The catalyst of this invention may contain 0.01 to 10 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 3 by weight, of the Group VIII noble metal based on the weight of the silica carrier, and 0.01 to 10 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 3 by weight, of the Group IV, V or VI element based on the carrier weight. The catalyst may contain 0.01 to 10 gram atoms, preferably 0.05 to 5 gram atoms of the Group IV,V or VI element per gram atom of the noble metal. Any known method may be employed without any limitation for applying the aforementioned catalytic components to the silica carrier. For example, it is possible to form a solution of the catalytic components in a solvent such as water, an aqueous solution of hydrochloric or nitric acid or other mineral acid, and an organic solvent, immerse the carrier in that solution, and heat it to dryness. Alternatively, it is possible to immerse the carrier in a solution of the catalytic components so that the carrier may adsorb the catalytic components, and remove the remaining solution by filtration or decantation, followed by drying, or calcining after washing if required.The silica carrier may be immersed in a mixed solution containing all the necessary catalytic components in order to apply all of the components simultaneously, though it is equally satisfactory to repeat the immersion of the carrier in a plurality of solutions each containing the individual catalytic component until all the components are applied to the carrier. The catalyst of this invention prepared as hereinabove described can advantageously maintain a high level of activity for a very long period of time when it is utilized for the manufacture of diacyloxyalkenes by reacting conjugated dienes, carboxylic acids and oxygen When the catalyst is used for the diacyloxylation of a conjugated diene, it is preferably to treat it beforehand with a reducing agent such as hydrogen or a reducing organic compound such as hydrazine, formalin or methanol. This treatment is usually carried out at a temperature of 1000C to 4000C. The conjugated dienes which can be diacyloxylated in the presence of the catalyst according to this invention include 1,3 butadiene, its derivatives such as isoprene, 1,3 pentadiene, 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene, 1,3 hexadiene, 2,4 hexadiene, 1,3 octadiene and 4 phenyl1,3 butadiene, and cyclic conjugated diene compounds such as cyclopentadiene, 1,3 cyclohexadiene and 1,3 cyclooctadiene. 1,3 butadiene is particularly preferred. These conjugated dienes do not need to be pure, but may contain nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a lower saturated hydrocarbon such as methane, ethane, propane and butane. Any carboxylic acid, such as a saturated or unsaturated aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic carboxylic acid, may be used for the diacyloxylation of a conjugated diene in the presence of the catalyst according to this invention. It is, however, preferred to use a lower aliphatic carboxylic acid, such as acetic acid, propionic acid or butyric acid. Acetic acid is most preferred. Although there is no particular limitation to the conditions for the diacyloxylating reaction in the presence of the catalyst of this invention, it is suitable to employ a reaction temperature of 40 C. to 1800C., a reaction pressure ranging from atmospheric to 100 kg cmê, and a molar conjugated diene carboxylic acid oxygen ratio of 1 0.5 to 10 0.1 to 5. The reaction may be conducted in a batch or continuous operation in the presence of the catalyst, and the catalyst may be maintained in a suspended mode in a reaction medium, or in the form of a fixed or a fluidized bed. The invention will now be described in further detail with reference to the following examples.Example 1 Silica Gel ID trade name of Fuji Davison Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan was heated in air at 5000C for an hour to form a silica carrier having the properties shown in Table 1. 10 g of the silica carrier were immersed in a solution prepared by dissolving 0.1750 g of palladium chloride PdC12 and 0.0536 g of tellurium dioxide TeO2 in 40 ml of 6N hydrochloric acid, and left to stand at room temperature for 24 hours. Then the carrier was slowly dried by evaporation over a bath of hot water.The solid thus obtained was dried in a stream of nitrogen in a tube at 1500C. for three hours, and reduced by heating at 2000C. for three hours and 400 C. for two hours in the presence of nitrogen saturated with methanol at room temperature. There was thus prepared Catalyst A containing 1.05 by weight of palladium and 0.20 by weight of tellurium, and having a tellurium palladium atom ratio of 0.16. 4 g of Catalyst A were placed in a stainless steel reaction tube having an inside diameter of 18 mm, and the reaction was conducted continuously at a temperature of 800C., while the reaction tube was fed with glacial acetic acid at a rate of 12.5 ml per hour, 1,3 butadiene at a rate of 60 millimols per hour and oxygen at a rate of 40 millimols per hour. The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography at the end of three hours and ten hours, respectively, after the reaction was started, whereby the space time yield of the diacetoxybutene intended to be produced, and the deactivation rate constant a time l of the catalyst were obtained. The latter T was calculated in accordance with the empirical formula showing the rate of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition k kg exp. a Ft wherein k rate constant t hours after the beginning of the reaction k initial rate constant and a deactivated rate constant time l The results are shown in Table 1.Example 2 Catalyst B containing 1.05 by weight of palladium and 0.20 by weight of tellurium, and having a tellurium palladium atom ratio of 0.16 was prepared by repeating the procedures of Example 1, except that SilicaGel Grade 70 tradename of Fuji Davison Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan was used instead of the silica gel used in Example 1.

The space time yield of diacetoxybutene, and the rate constant of catalyst deactivation based on the empirical formula indicating catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition were obtained at the end of three hours after the beginning of the reaction. The results are shown in Table 2, and teach that in order to obtain a catalyst maintaining a high level of activity for a long period of time, it is necessary to use a carrier composed of silica having a specific surface area of at least 200 m2 g and an average pore diameter of at least 100 .
