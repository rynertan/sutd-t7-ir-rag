# COMPLEMENTARY METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR

## Abstract
A complementary metal oxide semiconductor being comprised of at least one P channel MOSFET and at least one N channel MOSFET is disclosed. In the above semiconductor, at least one additional doped portion is formed close to at least one of the P and N channel MOSFETs at a small part of the region which is driven by the voltage supply. The addi tional doped portion is directly connected to the voltage sup ply.
