# Method for producing a polybutadiene material.

## Abstract
A 1,2 polymerization of 1,3 butadiene is carried out in a polymerization solvent in the presence of a 1,2 polymerization catalyst consisting essentially of a cobalt compound soluble in the polymerization solvent, an organic aluminium halide, an organic magnesium compound, and carbon disulfide and or phenyl isothiocyanate and in the presence or absence of a cis 1,4 polymerization product of 1,3 butadiene.
