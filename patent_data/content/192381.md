# Improvements to electronic control equipment.

## Abstract
Electrical control apparatus including a power supply, a regulating element, a manually operable control device which can be set to provide a preset output from the regulating element, and an automatic control circuit for modifying the operation of the control elements in the event of a power failure. The automatic control circuit is so arranged as to rapidly reduce the output to zero when the absolute supply voltage falls below a predetermined level, and to progressively raise the output to the preset level when the supply voltage is restored.
