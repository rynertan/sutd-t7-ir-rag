# Optical fibre cables.

## Abstract
An optical fibre cable has a plurality of longitudinally extending closed channels 6 formed in a protective cover, and each bonded by part of the outer wall 5 of the cover, wherein said wall 5 is formed with at least one region 8 of reduced thickness extending along a channel 6 so as to form a line of weakness which facilitates penetration of the cover to give access to the optical fibre 7 or fibres within the channel 6 . A rip cord 9 may be embedded in the wall 5 so that by pulling the rip cord 9 a slit 10 is formed in the wall 8 .
