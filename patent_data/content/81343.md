# Method and apparatus for the production of vitreous enamelled substrates.

## Abstract
A method of applying an enamel coating 14 and 15 to an apertured 11 metal base 10 is characterised by plugging the or each aperture with an electrically insulating material 12 , applying a coating 14, 15 of a vitreous material to one or both surfaces 13 and 16 of the base and then removing a core 18 of the vitreous material and the insulating material from the or each apertures to leave it lined with insulating material during subsequent firing of the vitreous material. By this means, thinning of vitreous material around the aperture is avoided, reducing the likelihood of electrical connection between the metal base and an electrical conductor extending through the aperture. The invention has particular application to the manufacture of electrical printed circuits.
