# Production of block copolyamide from omega lactam.

## Abstract
A process for producing high impact block copolyamide comprises anion polymerizing an at least 5 membered ring ω lactam, e.g. ε caprolactam and or ω laurolactam, in the presence of 2 30 wt of a prepolymer polymerization accelerator and a strongly basic catalyst. The pre polymer is prepared by reacting a a butadiene homopolymer and or butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer containing hydroxyl groups at the terminals thereof with b polymethylene polyphenylene isocyanate or tolylene diisocyanate at an equivalent ratio of isocyanate group to hydroxyl group NCO OH of 1 1 or more. Commercially available prepolym ers are described. The block copolyamide has high Izod impact strength and does not suffer from bleeding of polybutadiene.
