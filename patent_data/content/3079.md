## Description
I A RED LIGHT EMISSrVE DEVICES This invention relates to infra red light emissive devices, and in particular to such devices having active light emissive regions of the ternary solid solutionIn Sb, As and related multicomponent quarternary or higher solid solutions. Light emissive devices have been made that had an active light emissive region of In Sb, As grown epitaxially upon an In As substrate. A problem with this type of construction is that the addition of In Sb to In As to form a solid solution has the effect of changing the lattice spacing. Therefore a graded interlayer was necessary between the active region and the substrate, but even this did not entirely remove the strain from the active region which was relatively heavily dislocated. The present invention is directed to the problem of lattice mismatch. According to the present invention there is provided an infra red light emissive device having an active light emissive region of material of the ternaryIn Sb, As solid solution having a lattice spacing matched with that of Ga Sb, which material is epitaxially grown directly or indirectly upon a substrate of Ga Sb. The The invention also provides an infra red light emissive device having an active light emissive region of material of a multicomponent, quarternary or higher, solid solution having a lattice spacing matched with that ofGa Sb. and based upon the ternary n Sb, As solid solution, which material is epitaxially grown directly or indirectly upon a substrate of Ga Sb. Ga Sb has the same lattice constant as a particular compound of In Sb, As , approximately In Sb, 1AS0.9 therefore In Sbo lAsO 9 grown on a Ga Sb substrate is substantially strain free. There follows a description of infra red light emissive devices embodying the invention in preferred forms.The description refers to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a graph depicting the variation.of lattice spacing and band gap with composition for a number of ternary solid solutions of compound semiconductors, Figure 2 depicts a schematic cross section through a light emissive diode embodying the invention, Figure 3 is a graph depicting the variation in dielectric constant of the Al, Ga Sb solid solution with composition, and Figures 4 and 5 depict schematic cross sections through two further constructions of device embodying the present invention. Referring to Figure 1, and in particular to theIn Sb, As line between In As and In Sb, it can be seen that the addition of progressively more In Sb to In As has the effect of progressively increasing the lattice spacing at a relatively rapid rate. The four hatchings on this line, and each of the others, mark the 20, 40, 60 and 80 points respectively. The rate of increase in lattice spacing is for instance much more rapid than that produced by adding Al As to Ga As to form Al, Ga As. This shows why the growth of In Sb, As upon an In As substrate is much more difficult than growing Al, Ga As upon a substrate of Ga As. However, also from Figure 1 it is seen that Ga Sb has the same lattice constant as a particular point on theIn Sb, As line corresponding approximately to In Sbo.l As Therefore substantially strain free In Sbg1As0.9 can be grown upon a Ga Sb substrate. This enables structures of the type depicted schematically in Figure 2 to be grown. A Ga Sb substrate 20 of one conductivity type is provided, and then the material of layers 21 and 22 is grown epitaxially upon the substrate 20. Layer 21 has the same conductivity type as the substrate while layer 22 is arranged to have the opposite conductivity type in order to form a p n junction between them. The growth may be performed by the conventional methods of compound semiconductor material epitaxy.We prefer to use liquid phase epitaxy, and to use for this purpose a graphite slider boat system. From Figure 1 it can be seen that In Sbg.1AS0.9 has a band gap of about 0.3 eV and therefore the radiation produced in the vicinity of a p n junction formed in this material will be at a wavelength of about 4pin. The actual value of the emission wavelength may be shifted by going from the ternary In Sb, As solid solution to a quaternary or higher solid solution by increasing the proportion of In Sb and adding a further compound semiconductor material in sufficient quantity to restore the lattice spacing to its original value matching that of Ga Sb. To a first approximation the rate of change of lattice spacing and of band gap provided by adding a certain proportion of for instance Ga As to In Sb, As is the same as adding that proportion of Ga As to In As. In other words, referring to Figure 1, the effect of addingGa As to In Sb, As is to a first approximation given by a translation of the Ga As, Sb curve so that its In As end lies on the appropriate part of the In Sb, As curve.It is to be noted that the In Sb, As curve is not so steep at its lower end as the top end of the Ga As, Sb curve.Therefore, by increasing the proportion of In Sb in In Sb, As above In Sb0 1As0 9 and then adding sufficientGa As to restore the lattice spacing to the In Sbo lAsO g value, it can be seen that the band gap is reduced and hence the emission wavelength increased. Conversely it can be seen that, because the In As, P curve and the Al, In As curve are neither as steep as the In As, Sb curve, the compensation of additional In Sb with the appropriate amount of In P or Al P will have the effect of increasing the band gap and hence reducing the emission wavelength. Therefore the device of Figure 1 may employ multicomponent, quaternary of higher, solid solution epitaxial layers 21 and 22 in order to provide a wavelength of emission greater or less than that of the ternary In Sb, As composition with a lattice spacing matching that of Ga Sb. This multicomponent solid solution will The one having a lattice spacing matched with that of G Sb and based upon the ternary In Sb, As system. It will be noted that Ga Sb has a higher band gap than In Sb, As and therefore the heterojunction formed between the substrate 20 and layer 21 will serve to confine minority carriers. For some applications it may therefore be advantageous similarly to confine minority carriers on the opposite side of the p n junction by the use of an additional layer not shown in Figure 2 of Ga Sb on top of layer 22. By analogy with injection lasers based on Al, Ga As it might superficially be expected that it should be possible to construct a laser with an In Sb, As layer sandwiched between a pair of layers of Ga Sb. However although the two heterojunctions of such a structure are effective in confining minority carriers they do not provide the requisite optical guidance. This is because the refractive index of Ga Sb 3.83 at 4pm is greater than that of In As 3.51 at 4pm and greater than that of In Sb, As . This problem may be resolved by the use of Al, Ga Sb in place of Ga Sb. Figure 3 depicts the variation of optical frequency dielectric constant equal to the square of the refractive index for different compositions in the Al, Ga Sb solid solution. In order to provide optical confinement at a heterojunction the material bounding the active region must have a refractive index less than that of the active region, preferably about 1 less. Therefore by adding Al Sb to Ga Sb it is possible to reduce the refractive index to an acceptable value.Typically this will occur in the region of Alo 6GaO Sb. Al, Ga Sb appears to be more stable than Al, Ga As with respect to atmospheric attack, and it is found that Al Ga 4 Sb is stable in air at room temperature. 0.6 0.4 Referring again to Figure 1, it is seen that the lattice spacing of Al, Ga Sb and Al, Ga As both change with composition at substantially the same slow rate. Therefore, with an active region lattice spacing matched with that of Ga Sb, it is possible, without introducing undue strain, to vary the composition of Al, Ga Sb within relatively wide limits so as to adjust the strength of optical guidance to the desired value. Figure 4 depicts a laser which is functionally analo ous with the single heterostructure Al, Ga As laser.The laser is grown by epitaxy upon a Ga Sb substrate 40 and includes two, or optionally three, epitaxial layers 41, 42 and 43. Layer 41 has the opposite conductivity type to that of the substrate 40, and is made of material having the same lattice spacing as the substrate and it is made of In Sb, As or of a multicomponent, quaternary or higher, solid solution based on In Sb, As . Layer 42 has the same conductivity type as layer 41, and is made of Al, Ga Sb containing a sufficient proportion of Al Sb to reduce its refractive index beneath that of layer 41 so as to provide the requisite amount of optical confinement in addition to minority carrier confinement. Layer 43 has the same conductivity type as layer 42 and is an optional capping layer of Ga Sb which may be provided to protect the underlying layer 42 from atmospheric attack.This will be the more necessary if layer 42 contains a particularly large proportion of Al Sb which would make it more vulnerable to atmospheric attack. In this construction the heterojunction formed between the substrate 40 and layer 41 merely provides electrical confinement whereas that between layers 41 and 42 provides both electrical and optical confinement. Figure 5 depicts a laser which is functionally analogous with the double heterostructure Al, Ga As laser. This is essentially similar to that previously described with reference to Figure 4, but includes an additional layer 50 of Al, Ga As of the same conductivity type as the substrate 40 which is located between the substrate and layer 41 which in this instance may have either conductivity type. This layer 50 is of a composition providing it with a refractive index the desired amount less than that of layer 41 to provide the requisite optical guidance. In this way electrical and optical confinement is provided at both the heterojunctions flanking the active region provided by layer 41. The constructions depicted do not show any particular means for lateral confinement of photons or minority carriers in the active light emissive region. It will however be readily apparent that many of the techniques developed for such confinement in relation to Al, Ga As solid solutions will be applicable with little or no modifications to semiconductor devices constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention.
