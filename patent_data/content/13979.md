# Electronic parts mounting apparatus.

## Abstract
This is directed to an electronic parts mounting appa ratus comprising a means for carrying by given pitch an electronic parts collector T which is composed of elec tronic parts P , strip band 1 having many concaves 3 , for receiving the electronic parts P , disposed at equal inter vals and coating tape 2 for covering the concaves 3 in the receiving band a support means 11 for horizontally supporting said electronic parts collectors T with the coating tape 2 being placed on the top side a means 8, 12 for separating from the band the tape 2 of said col lector T and an picking means 14, 15 for adsorbing the electronic parts P one by one from the concave 3 of the band 1 under the cover open condition by separat ing the tape 2 from the band placed on said support means to carry and load the electronic parts P on a cir cuit board 13 , thus allowing the electronic parts P to be continuously and stably mounted on the circuit board 13 .
