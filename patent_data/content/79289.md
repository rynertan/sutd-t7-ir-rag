# Apparatus for crimping brush contacts.

## Abstract
A method of crimping contact wires 24 into a holder 26 of a brush contact 24 in which a converging series of indentors 16 each having a Vee shaped tip 72 are advanced into the holder by a cam sleeve 30 engaging cam surfaces 18 on each indentor, to form valley shaped crimp recess 78 forcing the holder material between adjacent pairs of contact wires 24 , which arrange themselves in a symmetrical pattern during the crimping. A series of flats 70 are also formed on the holder 26 end to tightly bundle the contact wires 24 projecting from the holder 26 . The indentors 16 and holder 26 are mounted in a nest 14 during the crimping process.
