# Method of producing improved metal filled organic coatings and product thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to the method of produc ing a metal filled organic coating on a substrate, which coating provides enhanced corrosion protection to said substrate, and to the product of such method. More particu larly, this invention is directed to the enhancement of the corrosion resistant properties of zinc rich organic coatings by subjecting such coatings to an electric discharge such as in corona discharge treatment.
