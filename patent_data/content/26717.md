# Drum brake assembly.

## Abstract
A drum brake assembly includes a pair of brake shoes 20, 22 which are carried by a backing plate 12 and engageable with a hydraulic actuator 16 . The hydraulic actuator 16 is operable to move the pair of brake shoes 20, 22 from a rest position to a braking position. A strut 30 extends between the pair of brake shoes 20, 22 and cooperates with a parking arm 36 to move the pair of brake shoes 20, 22 to the braking position during a parking brake application. A support assembly 18 on the backing plate 12 is disposed opposite the hydraulic actuator 16 for the purpose of absorbing braking torque developed by the pair of brake shoes 20, 22 . The support assembly 18 comprises a pair of blocks 46, 48 relative to each other. In a first position the blocks 46, 48 are in abutment with the backing plate 12 while in a second position the blocks 46, 48 are free to move a limited amount relative to the backing plate 12 . Moreover, the lever 50 imparts a separating force to the pair of brake shoes 20, 22 via the blocks 46, 48 during a parking brake application to expand the brake shoes 20, 22 radially. Trhis expansion is in addition to the movement imparted to the brake shoes 20, 22 by the strut 30 and parking arm 36 .
