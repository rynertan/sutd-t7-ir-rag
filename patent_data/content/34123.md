Due to this characteristic, the apparatus according to the invention enables dogs and similar animals to be washed rapidly, safely and efficiently without requiring any normal intervention on the part of specialised perso nnel. According to the invention, the spray nozzles are so orientated that, in use, the jet coming out of each nozzle overlaps with the jets of the adjacent nozzles. In this manner it is possible to obtain a uniform distribution of the sprayed liquid over the entire body of the animal placed inside the casing. Preferably, the spray nozzles each have an outlet opening of a flattened section.The apparatus according to the invention further compri ses supply means for supplying. hot air under pressure to the said spray nozzles, the said air supply means being controlled by the said central programming and control uni to.effect a drying cycle at the end of the wash cycle.According to a particularly advantageous characteristic of the invention the casing has an external wall and an internal wall which together define a peripheral interspace, and the spray nozzles are arranged on the internal wall in communication with the said interspace, the external wall being provided with at least one first input connection and with at least one output aperture which communicate with the said interspace and are respectively connected to the said water supply means and to the said discharge means and with at least one second input connection communicating with the said interspace and connected to the said air supply means.The spray nozzles advantageously comprise impressions in the form of circular indentations made in the surface of the internal wall of the casing by pressing, each impression having an elongate diametral slit forming the outlet openning of the spray nozzle.Due to this characteristic, the apparatus according to the invention is of particularly simple, strong and economic construction.The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the appended drawings, which are supplied purely by way of non imitative example, in which Figure 1 is a partially sectioned, djagiamiatic, perspective view of apparatus according to the invention, Figure 2 is a partially sectioned, diagrammatic elevational view in the direction of arrow II of Figure 1,Figure 3 is a partially sectioned, diagrammatic, elevational view in the direction of arrow III of Figure 1,Figure 4 is a partially sectioned, diagrammatic, elevational view in the direction of arrow IV of Figure 1,Figure 5 is a fragmentary perspective view to an enlarged scale of a detail of Figure 1,Figure 6 is a perspective view similar to Figure 1 showing a variant of the apparatus according to the invention,Figure 7 is a partially sectioned, diagrammatic, elevational view in the direction of the arrow VTI of Figure 6, andFigure 8 is a partially sectioned, diagrammatic, elevational view, according to the arrow VIII of Figure 6. In the embodiment of the apparatus shown in Figures 1 to 4, a support bed 10 carries a substantially cylindrical casing 12 with its axis horizontal, and a casing 14 in the form of a cabinet.The side wall of the cylindridaf casing 12 comprises an external wall 16 and an internal wall 18 spaced from ach other in such a way as to define a peripheral interspace 20. In correspondence with the lower part of the casing 12, the two walls 16 and 18 both have a flat base part 16a, 18a. The flat part 16a of the external wall 16 communicates, through apertures not visible in the drawing, with the interior of a collection tank 22 which has a sloping base and rests on the bed 10. The edge of the tank surrounds the lower part of the casing 12.One of the vertical end walls of the casing 12, indicated by 24, is provided with a circular aperture 26 around the edge of which are secured annular bellows of elastomer material 28. Four supports in the form of handles 30 are also secured to the wall 24 and serve to anchor four elastic belts 32. These belts 32 are attached to a collar 34 which may be opened and adjusted and which, in use, is intended to surround the neck of an animal placed inside the casing 12.The other end wall 36 of the casing 12 comprises a flexible sheet, for example, of elastomer material, which is centrally provided with a zip fastener 38, designed to allow the animal to enter and to leave the casing 12.The internal wall 18 of the casing 12 is provided over its entire surface with equispaced impressions in the form of circular indentations 40 made by pressing. Each indentation 40 has, in correspondence with its base, an elongants diametral slit 42 which at its ends extends beyond the edge of the said indentation. As can be clearly seen in Figure 5, the slits 42 of adjacent indentations 40 have different orientations.The incie l i ations 40 form a pJura ity of spray nozzles the outlet openings of which are constituted by the slits 42, and have a flattened section.The spray nozzles may have a form different from that shown and be provided, for example, on a tubular coil or on piping arranged inside the casing 12. However, the arrangement described above is extremely advantageous both from the point of view of simplicity of construction and that of operational efficiency.The external wall 16 of the casing 12 is provided with a.pair of first input connections 44 which are respectively disposed in the upper zone and the lower zone of the casing 12. The connections 44 open into the interspace 20 and are connected, by means of a delivery pipe 46, to the output 48 of an electric pump 50 associated with a receptacle 52 housed inside the casing 14. The receptacle 52 is provided with a first input connection 54 which may be connected by a supply pipe 56 to a water supply not shown. An on off electrovalve 58 is located in the first input connection 54. The sloping base of the collection tank 22, which, as previously explained, is in communication with the lower part of the interspace 20 of the casing 12, is provided with a discharge connection 60. This discharge connection 60 is connected by means of a two way connector 62, to a first and to a second discharge duct 65 and 66 respectively. A change over electrovalve 64 is located in the connector 62. The first discharge duct 65 leads to a drain situated externally of the apparatus, whilst the second discharge duct 66 is connected to a second input connection 68 of the eceptacle 52.A container 70 in the form of a hopper for containing detergent, is fixed onto the upper part of the receptacle 52. The container 70 communicates with the inside of the receptacle 52 through a pipe 72 into which there is inserted a regulating electrovalve 74.The external wall 16 of the casing 12 is also provided with a pair of second input connections 76 communicating with the interspace 20 and connected, by means of a delivery duct 78, with a hot air generator 80 of conventional type, housed inside the casing 14.The electric pump 50, the on off electrovalve 58, the change over electrovalve 64, the regulating electrovalve 74 and the hot air generator. 80 are electrically connected to a central programming and control unit 82 secured to the upper part of the housing 14. The active components of the central unit 82 may comprise electric or electronic circuits of the conventional type controlled by means of a programmable timer 84 and arranged to control the various components of the apparatus connected to the central unit 82, in a semi or fully automatic manner in accordance with a pre estab ished operating cycle.The operation of the apparatus of the invention is as follosus. In order. to enable an animal which is to be cleaned to enter the casing 12, it is necessary to undo the zip fastener 38 in the flexible wall 36 of the casing 12, as shown in Figure 2. The animal is then pushed towards the end wall 24 until its head enters the aperture 25. In this position, the bellows 28 of elastomer material close around the surface of the animal s neek, encompassing it tightly. To hold the animal in this position it is sufficient to fasten the collar 34 around the neck of the animal and anchor the belts 32 to their respective supports 30, as indicated in Figure 4. When the zip 38 has been done up again, the cleaning cycle may be started by operation of the controls of the central unit 82. The operational cycle of the machine, which may be pro gra mmed by means of the timer 84 of the central unit 82, preferably comprises the following successive phases pre wash, wash, rinse and drying. During the pre wash phase, the receptacle 52 is filled initially with water from the supply pipe 56. At the end of this filling operation, the on off valve 58 is closed and the electric pump 50 is operated to draw up water from the receptacle 52 and feed it under pressure through the delivery pipe 46, to the input connections 44 of the casing. 12. At the same time, the regulating valve 64 opens to allow a predetermined quantity of detergent to be supplied from the container 70 into the receptacle 52.The mixture of water and detergent supplied to the input connections 44 passes into the interspace 20 of the casing 12 and is distributed to the Various spray nozzles 40. In order to achieve a more uniform distribution of the liquid, two flow distributors, not shown in the drawings, can advantageously be associated with the input connections 44, these flow distributors comprising, for example, conical diffusers housed inside the interspace 20.The liquid mixture is then delivered through the spray nozzles 40 into the interior of the casing 12, against the body of the animal to be cleaned. The particular form of the nozzles 40 and the orientation of their respective outlet openings 42 described above, allows a series of flattened jets to be obtained which interfere with each other in the immediate vicinity of the internal wall 18 of the casing 12. This makes it possible tQ achieve a uniform diffusion of the liquid and to produce an efficient hydro massage action on the body of the animal durin cleaning.The liquid ejected from the spray nozzles 40 collects in the lower part of the casing 12 and is discharged into the collection tank 22. Due to the inclination of the base of the collection tank 22, the liquid gravitates towards the discharge conllection 60. During the prewash phase, the change over valve 64 is set in such a position that it interrunis flow through. the first discharge duct 65. The liquid can therefore flow only through the second discharge duct 66 to return to the inside of the receptacle 52. The pre wash phase is therefore effected in a closed circuit using the same liquid all the time. At the end of the pre wash phase, the change over valve 65 is set in such a position that it interrupts flow through the second discharge duct 66, forcing the liquid to be discharged to the exterior of the collection tank 22 through the first discharge duct 65.At the end of this discharge, the wash phase begins and is carried out in exactly the same manner as the prewash phase.At the end of this phase, the rinse phase begins, this phase being effected in an open cycle, with the on off valve 58 being open, and the change over valve 64 positioned for discharging through the first discharge duct 65. The regulating valve 74 is maintained permanently closed, so as to prevent the introduction of detergent into the receptacle 52.At the end of the rinse phase, the electric pump 50 stops and the hot air generator 80 is activated.This generator 80 is arranged to supply hot air under pressure to the spray nozzles 40 through the delivery pipe 78 and the input connections 76. During this drying phase, the zip fastener 38 of the flexible wall 36 of the casing 12 is preferably in its open position, in order to allow the air to escape out of the casing 12.At the end of the drying operation, the animal is removed from the casing 12, after the collar 34 has been opened.The variant of the apparatus shown in Figures 6 to 8 is, in general, similar to the one shown in Figures 1 to 4, and only the differences will be described in detail with the same reference numerals being used for identical or similar parts. In this variant, the back wall 86 of the casing 12, oppo site the wall 24, is rigid and comprises two substantially vertical sections 16b, 18b of the external wall 16 and the internal wall 18. To enable an animal to enter and leave the casing 12,, a portion 12a of the side wall of this casing 12 is hinged to the remaining portion, so as to form a door which may be swung up into the position, shown by a dashed line in Figures 7 and 8. Sealing means are of course provided in the areas of meeting of the door 12a and the rest of the casing 12, these means comprising, for example, a gasket of elastomer material.The operation of the apparatus shown in Figures 6 to 8 is the same as that described with reference to Figures 1 to 4.From the above it is clear that the apparatus of the invention enables the washing and subsequent drying of dogs and similar animals to be carried out in a totally automatic and programmed manner without requiring any manual intervention on the part of specialised personnel.Naturally, the effects of the present invention extend to models which achieve equivalent results using the same innovative concept.
