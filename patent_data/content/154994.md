# Improved surface tack free photosensitive resin composition and a method using same.

## Abstract
A photosensitive resin composition which is improved with respect to surface tack free characteristic after curing by exposure to actinic radiation is disclosed. Further, there is disclosed a method of preparing a surface tack free pho tocured pattern structure using the photosensitive resin composition, which enables pattern structures improved with respect to surface tack free characteristic to be ob tained in a shortened period of time.
