## Description
This invention relates to amidine compounds, their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Many physiologically active substances elicit their biological actions by interaction with specific sites known as receptors. Histamine is such a substance and has a number of biological actions. Those biological actions of histamine which are inhibited by drugs commonly called antihistamines , of which mepyramine, diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine are typical examples, are mediated through histamine H1 receptors. However, others of the biological actions of histamine are not inhibited by antihistamines and actions of this type which are inhibited by burimamide are mediated through receptors which are termed histamineH2 receptors, and which may be defined as those histamine receptors which are not blocked by mepyramine but are blocked by burimamide. Compounds which block histamine H2 receptors are referred to as histamine H2 antagonists. Blockade of histamine H2 receptors is of utility in inhibiting the biological actions of histamine which are not inhibited by antihistamines . Histamine H2 antagonists are therefore useful, for example, as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, as anti inflammatory agents and as agents which act on the cardiovascular system, for example as inhibitors of the effects of histamine on blood pressure. The present invention provides an amidine phosphonate compound of Structure 1 EMI1.1 Structure 1 in which Het is a 5 or 6 membered fully unsaturated heterocycle containing at least one nitrogen atom and optionally substituted by lower alkyl, trifluoromethyl, hydroxymethyl, halogen, hydroxy or lower alkoxy Z is sulphur or methylene n is 2 or 3 R1 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or Het CH2Z CH2 n p is 0 or 1 R2 is hydrogen or lower alkyl or R1 and R2 together form a CH2 2 or CH2 3 group 3 R3 is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lower alkyl and R4 is hydrogen when p is 0 and hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lower alkyl when p is 1. The above compounds where R4 is hydrogen, which are phosphonic acid mono esters, are the first phosphorus compounds to be discovered to be histamine H2 antagonists, and the remaining compounds, namely those where p is 1 and 4R is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lower alkyl , which are phosphonic acid diesters, are useful as intermediates for conversion by hydrolysis to the histamine H2 antagonists where p is 1 and R is hydrogen. Structure 1 is representative of the tautomeric forms in which the compounds can exist. The compounds where R4 is hydrogen the moso esters have both basic and acidic character and can be prepared in the form of their acid addition salts or their salts with bases such as sodium hydroxide as well as in zwitterionic form. The compounds where R is not hydrogen the di esters have basic character and can be prepared in the form of their acid addition salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and salts with bases are particularly concerned. In this specification by lower alkyl and lower alkoxy are meant an alkyl or alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms it can be straight or branched. An aryl group is preferably phonyl. Examples of heterocycles of the group Het are imidazole, pyridine, thiazole, isothiazole, oxazole, isoxazole, triazole and thiadiazole. Preferably the group Het is linked to CH2Z by a carbon atom of the heterocycle adjacent to a nitrogen atom. Preferably the heterocycle of Het is imidazole, particularly Het is 2 or 4 imidazolyl optionally substituted by lower alkyl especially methyl hydroxymethyl, or halogen especially chlorine or bromine . Especially valuable are compounds where Het is a 5 methyl 4 imidazolyl or 2 thiazolyl group.Other suitable groups are 2 pyridyl optionally substituted by lower alkyl especially methyl , halogen especially chlorine or bromine , hydroxy or lower alkoxy especially methoxy , 3 isothiazolyl optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, 3 1,2,5 thiadiazolyl optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine and 2 1,3,4 thiadiazolyl . Where R is Het CH2Z CH2 n , this can be the same as or different from the Het CHzZ CH2 shown in Structure 1. Preferably Z is sulphur and n is 2. Where p is 1, preferably R2 is hydrogen. Where R1 is lower alkyl preferably it is methyl. Where R1 and R2 together form a CH2 2 or CH2 3 group, preferably they form a CH2 2 group, which together with the adjacent nitrogen atoms and the carbon between them form an imidazoline ring. Particularly suitable compounds are those in which R3 is methyl, ethyl, phenyl and benzyl. Examples of phosphonic acids particularly suitable as the parent acids of the mono and di esters of Structure 1 are A. methyl N 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolyl methylthio ethyl amidinophosphonic acid,B. methyl N 2 2 thiazolylmethylthio ethyl amidino phosphonic acid,C. N rnethyl N 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolyl methylthio ethyl guanidinophosphonic acid, andD. N,N ethylene N 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolyl methylthio ethyl gianidino N phosphonic acid. Specific examples of intermediate di esters of the invention are the dibenzyl and benzyl ethyl esters of the phosphonic acid C. Specific examples of the mono esters of the invention, which are H2 antagonists, are the methyl and ethyl esters of the phosphonic acid A, the ethyl ester of the phosphonic acid B, the ethyl and benzyl esters of the phosphonic acidC, and the benzyl ester of the phosphonic acid D. In a process of the invention a compound of Structure 1 is prepared by reacting a primary amino compound R1NH or Het CHZZ CH2 nNH2 with the complementary compound ofStructure 2 or 3EMI4.1 Structure 2 Structure 3 where A is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lolnrer alkyl , andHet, Z, n, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined for Structure 1 provided that where p is 0, R4 is hydrogen and where R4 in the product is lower alkyl 5 aryl or aryl lower alkyl and a compound where R4 is hydrogen is required, the product is selectively hydrolysed. In accordance with the above, compounds where p is 0 are prepared by reaction of the appropriate primary amino compound with a phosphonic monoester of Structure 4 or 5.EMI4.2 Structure 4 Structure 5 These starting materials can be obtained by the reaction of an organic iodide AI, especially methyl iodide, with a corresponding intermediate compound Het CH2Z CH2 nNHCSPO OR 0R 4 or R1NHCSPO 0R3 oR , when the sulphur atom is alkylated and the grpup R4 is removed. Intermediates of this type can themselves be prepared by the reaction of a compound R30PX2 whereX is chlorine with one equivalent of an alcohol R OH in the presence of a tertiary amine to form a compound XP oR3 0R4 , followed by hydrolysis with water to a compound HPo oR3 0R4 and reaction of this with an isothiocyanate Het CH2Z CH2 nNCS or R1NCS, for instance using sodium methoxide in methanol.Preferably A is methyl preferably X is chlorine. The amidine phosphonate compounds of Structure 1 where p is 1 can be prepared by a process in which the units of the structure represented by Het CH2Z CH2 nNH , R1N , CNR2 3 CNR 4 and Po oR3 0R4 designated units la, lb, 2 and 3 respectively are brought together in the correct sequence using as reagents compounds of the following structure for unit la Het cH2z cH2 nNH2 for unit lb R1NH2 for unit 2 AS 2C NR2 for unit 3 XPo oR3 0R where X is halogen and each of R3 and R4 is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lower alkyl , with, if required, conversion of the group R4 to hydrogen in the endproduct. Preferably A is methyl preferably X is chlorine. Thus the unit la or Ib reagents can be coupled with the unit 2 reagent by known procedures to give respectively the unit combinations la2 and lb2 of Structures 6 and 7.EMI5.1 Structure 6 Structure 7 Alternatively the unit 2 reagent where R is hydrogen can be coupled with the unit 3 reagent by known procedures to give the unit combination 23 of Structure 8EMI5.2 Structure 8 In the next step the unit combination la2 or lb2 can be coupled with the unit lb or la reagent, respectively, to give the unit combination lab2 of Structure 9EMI5.3 Stl ucture 9 which is then coupled with the unit 3 reagent to give the unit combination lab23, representing an amidine phosphonate of Structure 1 in which the group R can be converted to hydrogen by hydrolysis. Alternatively the unit combinations la2 and lb2 can be coupled with the unit 3 reagent, or the unit combination 23 can coupled with the unit reagent la or lb, to give the unit combinations la23 and lb23 and these can be further coupled with the unit ib and la reagents respectively, before or after converting the group R4 to hydrogen. The hydrolytic replacement by hydrogen of the organic group R4 derived from the unit 3 reagent can be effected at any stage subsequent to the coupling of that reagent. WhereR1 is itself Het CH2Z CH2 n , the unit la and lb reagents are the same and two equivalents of the amine can be coupled with unit 2 reagent to replace the two groups AS successively and produce the unit combination lab2 in one combined stage. Whether the coupling reactions are effected with introduction of the phosphonate group by means of the unit 3 reagent before or after either or both the amine radicals by means of the unit la and Ib reagents, the end result is the same, so that the various possible sequences are chemically equivalent. The unit 2 reagent has obvious chemical equivalents which can be employed instead, in that the groups SA can be replaced by lower alkoxy, aryloxy or methylsulphinyl groups.The use of obvious chemical equivalents is to be considered as within the scope of the claims of this specification. Preferably in a process for preparing a compound ofStructure 1 where p is 1, the process comprises the preliminary step of reacting a compound of Structure 6 or 7 with a compound XPo oR3 0R4 where X is halogen and each of R and R4 is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lower alkyl .The invention also provides a process for preparing a compound of Structure 1 where p is 1, in which the units of structure of the compound represented by Het CH2Z CH2 2NH , R1N , ECNRS , and PO OR3 OR4 are brought together in the correct sequence using as reagents compounds of the structure Het cH2z cH2 nNH2 R1NH2, AS 2c NR , and XPO OR3, oR4 where X is halogen and R4 is lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lower alkyl . Where in the compound of Structure 1 R1 and together form a CH2 2 or CH2 3 group, there are no corresponding separate units of structure lb and 2, but these are taken together as a single unit R1N CNR2 which is provided by the reagent R1NHC SA NR2, and which is reacted with the unit 3 reagent described above, and then with the unit la reagent or the compound of Structure 1 can be formed by the obvious chemical equivalent of using the reagents in the reverse order and again the group R4 can be converted to hydrogen at any time after coupling of the unit 3 reagent. In a reagent of structure XPO OR OR , X is preferably chlorine. Such a reagent can be prepared by reacting a phosphoryl halide POX3 with an equivalent amount of an alcohol R30H or R40H in the presence of an equivalent amount of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine, for instance triethylamine or pyridine the second esterifying group is introduced into the product by displacement of a second halogen atom in the same way or if R and R4 are the same, two equivalents of alcohol and base can be used to introduce both esterifying groups in one step. The unit reagents la, lb and 2 can be prepared by known methods. Coupling reactions using compounds in which the groupSA is replaced by an amino or imino group or in which the unit 3 reagent is employed can be carried out by known methods. In place of the unit 3 reagent there can be employed a compound of the same structure except that X is hydrogen, and reacting this in a two phase system comprising aqueous sodium hydroxide and carbon tetrachloride with the appropriate compound containing the structural unit 2 an anion where X is replaced with a negative charge is initially formed and this reacts with carbon tetrachloride to give the chloro compound which is the unit 3 reagent. The conversion of the group R4 from lower alkyl, aryl or aryl lower alkyl to hydrogen can be effected by replacement under conditions which do not affect other groups present.When the conversion is effected on a compound in which all the structural units are present, the replacement can be effected by hydrolysis with an aqueous acid, for example hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. Selective hydrolysis to replace R4 but not R as well is easy because removal of the second ester group is very difficult to effect. The groups R3 and R4 are so chosen that the desired group remains. A benzyl group is more readily cleaved with hydrobromic acid than a phenyl or ethyl group, so that compounds where R3 is phenyl or ethyl and R4 is hydrogen can be obtained by reaction of hydrobromic acid with the benzyl phenyl ester or the benzyl ethyl ester. The mono ethyl ester can be obtained by reaction of the diethyl ester with sodium iodide in aqueous acetone.The monophenyl ester can be obtained from the diphenyl ester by reaction with sodium hydroxide under conditions sufficiently mild to avoid disruption of the remainder of the molecule. Where the conversion is effected on a compound containing an SA group for example lower alkylthio , it can be carried out by treatment with aqueous pyridinium chloride or ammonium iodide. The compounds of Structure 1 that are pharmacologically active are those in which R4 is hydrogen. The active compounds block histamine H2 receptors that is, they inhibit the biological actions of histamine which are not inhibited by antihistamines such as mepyramine but are inhibited by burimamide. For example, they inhibit histamine stimulated secretion of gastric acid from the lumen perfused stomachs of rats anaesthetised with urethane, at doses of from 0.5 to 256 micromoles per kilogram intravenously. Their activity as histamine H2 antagonists is also demonstrated by their ability to inhibit other actions of histamine which are not mediated by histamine H1 receptors. For example, they inhibit the actions of histamine on the isolated guinea pig atrium and isolated rat uterus.They inhibit the basal secretion of gastric acid and also that stimulated by pentagastrin or by food. In a conventional test such as the measurement of blood pressure in the anaesthetised cat, at doses of from 0.5 to 256 micromoles per kilogram intravenously, they inhibit the vasodilator action of histamine.The potency of the compounds is illustrated by an effective dose producing 50 inhibition of gastric acid secretion in the anaesthetised rat and producing 50 inhibition of histamine induced tachycardia in the isolated guinea pig 4 atrium less than 10 Molar . The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise a pharmaceutical carrier and a pharmacologically active compound of the invention of Structure 1 where R is hydrogen, which can be in the zwitterionic form or in the form of its addition salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or its salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable base. Such acid addition salts include those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, sulphuric and maleic acids and may conveniently be formed from the corresponding zwitterionic compounds by standard procedures, for example by treating them with an acid in a lower alkanol or by the use of ion exchange resins to form the required salt either directly or from a different addition salt. Salts with bases for example the sodium or potassium salts can be prepared in the usual way by neutralisation of the zwitterionic form. The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be a solid or liquid. Examples of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate and stearic acid. Examples of liquid farriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil and water. If a solid carrier is used, the composition can be prepared in the form of a tablet, capsule, troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier in a unit dosage form is generally from about 25 mg to about 300 mg. If a liquid carrier is used, the composition can be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, a sterile injectable liquid contained for example in an ampoule or an aqueous or non aqueous liquid suspension. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques involving procedures such as mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the des ired preparation. The active ingredient is present in the compositions in an effective amount to block histamineH2 receptors. Preferably, each dosage unit contains the active ingredient in an amount of from about 50 mg to about 250 mg. The invention provides a method of blocking histamineH2 receptors which comprises administering to an animal a pharmacologically active compound of Structure 1 whereR4 is hydrogen, which can be in the zwitterionic form or in the form of its addition salt with a pharmaceuticallyacceptable acid or its salt with a pharmaceuticallyacceptable base, or a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound. The active ingredient will preferably be administered one to six times per day. The daily dosage regimen will generally be from about 150 mg to about 1500 mg.The route of administration may be oral or parenteral. In the treatment of certain conditions, for example inflammation, and in inhibiting the actions of histamine on blood pressure, a combination of the histamine H2 antagonsts of the invention with histamine H1 antagonists is useful.
