# A resistance ladder network.

## Abstract
A plurality of resistors 5 are connected in a ladder format and disposed in parallel with each other. Each of the resistors has a resistance part 5A and 5B and two connection ends connected to the resistance part. The resistance part of each resistor 5 includes two generally parallel limbs 5A and 5B. The connection ends are all located at one side of the network. This configuration enables wiring lines to overlie the resistance part of the ladder network without the use of two layer aluminium wiring since wiring running in the same direction as the resistors 5 is avoided.
