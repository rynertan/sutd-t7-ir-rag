# Drive system for imparting translational motion to a plurality of pairs of elements.

## Abstract
A cable drive system is provided in which a fixedly mounted reversible motor 29 imparts translational motion to a plurality of pairs of elements 2,3,4,5 such as the right and left pairs of paper moving tractors in a highspeed printer. By means of a continuous cable loop 10,11 routed around passive rotational elements, each element of a pair of elements, each of which is rigidly attached to the cable, can be translated the same distance in the same direction as the other while the relative alignment of one element with respect to the other element is maintained. Means for selectively translating one pair of elements independent ly or a plurality of pairs of elements simultaneously while maintaining the distance between the pairs are provided.
