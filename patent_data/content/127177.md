Reaction of a compound of formula XXIII with a methoxylating agent. e.a., an alkali metal methoxide. yields a compound in combination with its enantiomer if R3 and R4 are the same or if XXIII is a racemic mixture having the formulaEMI25.2 The reaction can be run in an organic solvent, e.g.. a polar organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. at a reduced temperature. Alternatively, a compound of formula VII can be converted to a compound of formula XXIV using a single step procedure. The methoxylating agent can first be mixed with a compound of formula VII and the N chlorinating reagent then added to the reaction mixture.
