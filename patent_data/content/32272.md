# A METHOD AND A DEVICE FOR ABSORBING AND EMITTING HEAT OR COLD FROM THE GROUND

## Abstract
A method and a device for locating a coiled pipe 16 into the ground, vertically or inclined, said coiled pipe working as a heat exchanger in a heat pump system. In order to decrease operations in gardens or other ground surrounding the building, which is to be heated, or to make these opera tions needless, and in order to simplify the locating of coiled pipes in the soil it is suggested that the coiled pipe 16 is arranged on the outside of a driving means 11 , e.g. a pile, a tube 30 , a basket 28 or the like, that the coiled pipe is surrounded by a protective jacket 20 , and that these are brought down together, either along the pile already located in the ground or in connection with the driving of the pile to the required depth in the ground, and that pipings 17, 18 , coming from the coiled pipe, are drawn in the space arisen from the soil, which has been forced aside by said protective jacket, so that a connection is established between the coiled pipe 16 and the ground surface.
