# Garage door actuators.

## Abstract
A garage door actuator 10 comprises a motor driven screw 20 at least partially disposed within guide means 28 and a partial nut 30 which is guided by the guide means and moved longitudinally therealong by engagement with the rotating screw. The partial nut 30 is connectable to a garage door to open and close the door. In order to shorten the package in which the garage door actuator is transported or shipped, the screw and guide means are both formed in two or more parts which can be coupled together by a screw coupling 11 . The screw parts 21, 22 are shipped to the customer in a disconnected condition but one in which the coupling readily may be connected in a proper phase to avoid mismatch of the screw threads.
