# Bread mix and process.

## Abstract
Disclosed are a dry mix and a process which enable the quick preparation of high quality bread. The dry mix is characterized by its ability to form a high quality bread in less than two hours, and preferably less than about 90 minutes. In its broad aspects, the mix requires the presence of flour, from 1.5 to 2.5 quick leavening active dry yeast, and from 0.1 to 0.75 of a dough conditioner comprising either calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate or sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate. Optionally, the mix can employ up to 10 of a balanced chemical leavening system. The combined action of the ingredients in this simplified bread formula permits the elimination of the fermentation and kneading steps directly following mixing of the bread mix with water. This permits a simplified process comprising mixing the dry mix with water to form a dough, shaping the dough for baking, proofing the units for from about 15 to about 45 minutes, and baking. With the chemical leavening system, the total time for preparing the bread is reduced by about 15 minutes due to a reduction in the time required for proofing.

## Description
DESCRIPTION BREAD MIX AND PROCESSTechnical Field The present invention relates to bread and more particularly, to an improved dry mix and a method which enable the rapid and simplified production of high quality bread in the home. Baking bread is normally a complicated procedure which takes from 3.5 to 5 hours to complete. A typical procedure calls for forming a dough by mixing water, yeast, flour and other minor additives such as salt, sugar, and shortening in a bowl and then kneading by alternately flattening and folding for a period of at least about 10 minutes.After the kneading, the dough is placed in a warm environment to permit the yeast to ferment, causing the dough to rise and to effect the proper changes in the gluten and starch portions of the flour.After this initial fermentation, during which the dough will have doubled in volume, the dough is then punched down, kneaded for another two or three minute period, and subjected to an intermediate fermentation or proofing step until the volume has again doubled. The large dough mass is then worked by hand, divided into units of suitable size for baking, and placed in pans where it is permitted to proof for another 30 minutes or so to double the volume. Finally, the dough is then baked for about 30 minutes. Because of this complex procedure, very few people find the time to prepare home baked fresh bread despite its universal appeal. Recently, there have been developed batter recipes for preparing home baked bread with reduced time and effort commitments. However, because a true dough is not formed, the texture of the bread, including its resilience and crumb, cannot be considered to be of high quality. These bread mixes typically contain excess water, chemical leavening, and medium soft flour which permit the formation of a batter however, it is the batter form of the product which is responsible for the relatively inferior quality of the end product.Background Art In one recent attempt to provide an improved dry mix and process for home bread baking, Henika et al disclose in US Patent 3,615,680, a dry mix which contains essential gluten activating and maturing agents, with the activating agent being present at levels sufficient to react with substantially all of the protein in the dough to achieve desired dough viscosities in a short mixing period. Starch modifying agents are also used for improvement of flavor and dough properties, and slow acting oxidants or maturing agents are also employed.While the disclosed procedure does provide a significant simplification over the prior art, it is still more complicated than would be desired, and we have had difficulty in reproducing the quality indicated in the patent. Specifically, reference to Example 1 shows an initial step of separately hydrating the active dry yeast with water prior to mixing with the remaining dry ingredients. Then, after mixing is completed, the resulting dough is allowed to ferment for at least 15 minutes. After fermentation is completed, the dough is then kneaded steadily for about 3 minutes. Following these stages, the dough is divided into suitably shaped pieces and placed in a baking pan. Then, the dough is placed in an oven maintained at about 1400F for 30 minutes for proofing prior to baking in conventional manner.While this procedure does permit the reduction in the fermentation and kneading requirements nprmally necessary for bread preparation, it achieves this only with the addition of gluten activating and maturing agents and still requires significant fermentation and kneading in combination with a proofing step which requires careful temperature control. In fact, the initial step of hydrating the active dry yeast requires careful temperature control, although it is indicated that it is possible to add all of the ingredients to the water at one time. In another effort to produce a simplified bread mix and process, it is disclosed in US Patent 3,617,305, that the use of an additive composition containing defined amounts of an ascorbate compound, an edible oxidizing agent, and an edible sulfhydrylcontaining reducing agent, permits a substantial reduction in the time usually required for the kneading and fermentation steps, and in certain instances, either one of these steps may be eliminated. Significantly, however, either a significant kneading time on the order of 4 minutes or more after the initial mixing, or an initial fermentation of from at least 15 to about 60 minutes is required for good results. And, it is preferred in all instances that kneading be conducted for at least about 1 minute.Thus, while this procedure does to some extent simplify the home baking procedure and reduce the time requirements, further improvement would be desired.Disclosure of Invention Accordingly, it is an object of at least the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a dry mix and a process which permit the simple preparation of bread in a total time from addition of water to completion of baking of less than 2 hours, and preferably less than about 90 minutes. It is another object of at least the preferred embodiments of the present invention to provide a dry mix and a process for simply preparing high quality bread through the unique combination of a particular class of dough conditioners and type of yeast, both employed at critically effective levels to virtually eliminate any requirement for fermenting the dough after initial preparatinn and for kneading the dough prior to proofing. The present invention provides a bread mix, an improved process for preparing bread employing the bread mix, and the product of that process. In its broad aspects, the bread mix comprises flour from 1.5 to 2.5 quick leavening active dry yeast and from 0.1 to 0.75 of a dough conditioner selected from calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate, sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate, and mixtures of these all percentages based on the weight of the mix.According to one embodiment, from about 2 to about 10 of a balanced chemical leavening system is employed. The process in its broader aspects comprises mixing the above dry mix with water to form a dough shaping the dough for baking proofing the shaped units for from about 15 to about 45 minutes and baking. The product of this process is also claimed. The dry mix and process of the present invention are applicable to the preparation of virtually any type of bread or yeast leavened dough product. Particularly preferred products include white bread, French style white bread, rye bread, and pumpernickel bread. The type of flour employed will be selected not only for its gluten content, but also its desired flavor and texture imparting characteristics to achieve the desired type of bread while not departing from the basic achievement of the invention. Among the suitable flours are high gluten wheat flour, rye flour, pumpernickel meal, whole wheat flour, cracked wheat flour, and other bleached or unbleached flours. For best results, it is preferred to employ a major proportion, on the order of at least 70 of the flour mixture of a high gluten flour having a protein content of at least about 14 . Also important in the selection of the flour are the variety and a low ash content.However, those skilled in the art will be able to vary the type of flour as is conventional in the art to achieve desired textural variations. Among the advantages of the present invention is its ability to avoid two of the most prevalent causes for failure in bread preparation by novices namely, improper yeast rehydration and variation in flour quality. This can be attributed to the employment of a critical combination of a particular type of yeast and a particular class of dough conditioners at critical levels. The yeast is of a type, activity, and dispersibility which permits its incorporation into the dough by simple mixing to provide a uniform dispersion at a high level without the typically associated textural graininess and spotted appearance to the crust when other types of yeast at similar levels are employed.According to the present invention, the yeast need not be separately rehydrated, but is preferably hydrated simply by the mixing of the dry mix with hot tap water. The chemical leavening system is preferably of a type which will react to give off carbon dioxide only under conditions of heat achieved during baking, e.g. dough temperatures in excess of 1200F, which are detrimental to continued yeast activity. Combining these features with the use of dough conditioners which are selected to achieve rapid hydration of the dough yet permit easy mixing and suitable strengthening of the dough to entrap evolved CO2, virtually eliminates the usual difficulties encountered with variations in flour quality which may otherwise cause gross variations in final bread quality following a standardized process. The yeast employed according to the present invention is a quick leavening active dry yeast.Yeasts of this type are characterized by a relatively high protein content, preferably from about 40 to about 60 a small uniform particle size, preferably on the order of from about 0.2 to about 2.0 millimeters in diameter and a relatively low moisture content, typically on the order of from about 3 to about 8 , preferably from about 4 to about 5 . Preferably, yeasts of this type will contain minor amounts, e.g. from 0.5 to 2 , of a surface active agent such as polysorbate 60, or diacetyl esters of fully saturated vegetable oils, and a minor amount, e.g. from 0.5 to 1 , of a stabilizer such as carboxymethylcellulose, and other hydrophilic colloids, which are employed in the formation of the dispersion of yeast to achieve the desired low moisture content upon drying but yet permit rapid rehydration.One process for preparing a quick leavening active dry yeast is described inUS Patent 3,843,800 to Langejan. The entire disclosure of this patent is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Another procedure for preparing the quick leavening active dry yeast is described in Canadian Patent 1,075,077, and this entire disclosure of this patent is likewise hereby incorporated herein by reference. The proper leavening within the short period of time contemplated by the present invention, requires the use of at least 1.5, and up to 2.5 , of quickleavening active dry yeast in the formulation.Preferred levels will be within the range of from about 1.65 to about 2.15 based on the weight of the mix. It has been found that the levels lower than these minima will not provide the desired leavening while levels above these maxima will tend to impart a noticeable yeasty off flavor. To achieve the necessary leavening, it is essential that the yeast be of the quick leavening type described above or there will be insufficient volume in the final product. Even with these levels of a suitably active yeast, it is essential that the yeast be readily dispersible uniformly throughout the dough with minimal mixing. This also dictates the use of quick leavening active dry yeast as defined above.The conditions under which the yeast is dried, the noted additives, and the particle size of the quickleavening active dry yeast are believed important to provide the desired degree of dispersibility. To further reduce preparation time, the composition of the bread mix can also include an effective amount, within the range of from 2 to 10 , of a balanced chemical leavening system comprising an acid and a base. By the term balanced chemical leavening system it is meant that proper levels of a suitable acid and a suitable base are present to substantially fully react with each other to generate carbon dioxide. The chemical leavening system is preferably of a type which will react to give off carbon dioxide only under conditions of heat achieved during baking, e.g. dough temperatures in excess of 1200F, which would otherwise be detrimental to continued yeast activity.Thus, despite the short proof time of from 15 to 30 minutes, the dough will have enough internal strength to hold carbon dioxide generated by the balanced chemical leavening system to achieve the desired final bread volume. Among the suitable balanced chemical leavening systems are those comprising, based on the weight of the mix from 4.24 to 6.4 glucono delta lactone with 2.0 to 2.44 sodium bicarbonate from 1.5 to 3.4 sodium aluminum phosphate with from 1.24 to 2.5 sodium bicarbonate from 1.7 to 2.0 sodium acid pyrophosphate with from 1.25 to 1.5 sodium bicarbonate and from 1.25 to 2.5 sodium aluminum sulfate with an equal weight of sodium bicarbonate. Further essential to the composition of the bread mix of the invention is the presence of a dough conditioner selected from calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate, sodium stearoyl 2lactylate and mixtures of these. The dough conditioner must be present at a level of from 0.1 to 0.75 based on the weight of the mix. While it has been determined that a preferred level of about 0.4 to about 0.6 can be employed with good results for most types of breads, certain types of textures, such as a French bread texture will be achieved with lower levels on the order of from about 0.1 to 0.2 based upon the weight of the mix. The calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate and sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate are well known for use in yeast leavened doughs and are believed to somehow complex with the protein of bread doughs, forming cross linkages between protein platelets and their adjacent sheets. In this manner, these dough conditioners provide broad tolerence in dough mixing times, improve the hydration of the dough, improve dough handling, and also strengthen the doughs so that poor or weak flours will perform better. These effects were studied and reported upon by William H. Knightly in The Evolution of Softeners andConditioners Used in Baked Foods , THE BAKERSDIGEST, October 1973, pages 64 75, and V. A.DeStefanis in Binding of Crumb Softeners and DoughStrengtheners During Bread Making , CEREALCHEMISTRY, January February 1977, pages 13 24. One preferred type of sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate is sold under the registered trademark Emplex and is described by the manufacturer as being prepared by the reaction of stearic acid and lactic acid followed by the conversion to the sodium salt. This product is indicated to have the following analytical specifications Acid Value 60 80 Ester No. 150 190 Sodium content 2.5 5.0 The unique combination of the specific level of the quick leavening active dry yeast and the sodium or calcium ste aroyl 2 lactyl ate dough conditioners provide a simplicity in processing and a consistency in results which is quite surprising.By the use of this novel combination in a dry bread mix according to the invention, it is possible to prepare bread by a highly simplified process which eliminates kneading of the dough after initial mixing and virtually eliminates a separate step of fermenting following the mixing step. In its broad aspects, the process comprises mixing water with a dry mix to form a dough, the dry mix being of the type described above comprising flour, from 1.5 to 2.5 quick leavening active dry yeast1 and from 0.1 to 0.75 of a dough conditioner selected from calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate, sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate, and mixtures of these, all percentages based on the weight of the dry mix shaping the dough into units of the desired weight for baking proofing the shaped units for from about 30 to about 45 minutes and baking.According to one embodiment proofing time can be reduced to as low as 15 minutes by also including in the mix from 2 to 10 of a balanced chemical leavening system. To achieve the best results according to this process, it is preferred to permit the dough to rest for a period of from about 3 to less than 15 minutes, preferably from 5 to 10 minutes after mixing and before shaping. While some fermentation of the quick leavening active dry yeast does occur during this period, this resting step is not primarily for the purpose of fermenting which, according to the prior art procedures, has entailed extended periods of time of up to several hours, but is primarily for the purpose of permitting the moisture within the dough to more uniformly hydrate the dry ingredients to enable less troublesome shaping of the dough into units of the desired size and shape for baking. The sodium or calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate dough conditioner is advantageously performing its function during the rest period, by enhancing the hydration and strengthening the dough.It is noted that US Patent 3,843,800 which describes the preparation of quickleavening active dry yeast sets forth in Example 10 a test of the baking quality of the yeast as compared to other types of yeast and shows a total fermentation or proof time of 145 minutes with a full 85 minutes of that time being prior to a final proof of 60 minutes. By employing the unique combination of the sodium or calcium stearoyl 2lactylate dough conditioner at the indicated levels along with the indicated levels of quick leavening active dry yeast according to the present invention, this 85 minute initial fermentation time can be eliminated and replaced with a very short rest period just sufficient in length to permit the water, through the action of the dough conditioner, to fully hydrate the dough to provide a workable mass. An advantage of the present invention resides, however, in the fact that where an extended period of time for the rest period is required to coordinate the baking of the bread with other activities in the kitchen or for any other reason, that additional resting time will not adversely affect the quality of the bread produced. Similarly, kneading the dough after mixing is not required when employing the bread mix of the present invention because the simple mixing followed by the rest step, wherein the dough is uniformly hydrated and strengthened by the dough conditioner is sufficient to provide a high quality bread product. The dispersibility of the yeast, combined with its quick leavening activity at the high level employed and the dough strengthening effect of the dough conditioner, enable the rapid achievement of the suitable dough characteristics to permit good gas retention during a relatively short final proof on the order of from about 30 to about 45 minutes, preferably about 40 minutes, without chemical leavening, and from about 15 to about 30 minutes with chemical leavening.Thus, the present invention eliminates any requirement for kneading as conventionally performed in prior art by vigorously working, such as by alternately folding and flattening the dough. The rapid, uniform dispersibility of the yeast within the dough by simple mixing, followed by the resting period wherein the sodium or calcium stearoyl 2 lactylate dough conditioner and water act in concert to hydrate the dough and strengthen it sufficiently to retain gas, as it is later developed during proofing, are effective without any kneading.However, where desired by a particular baker, or due to a mistake in shaping the dough into the desired size, extended periods of working the dough in a manner similar to conventional kneading will not adversely affect the final quality of the bread. The water added to the dry ingredients to form the dough is preferably tap water at a temperature within the range of from about 1000 to 1400F. This permits, in a typical formula for preparing a single loaf of bread, the addition of about 240 milliliters of water 1 cup to from about 400 to 410 grams of dry mix, to achieve an ideal temperature for activating the yeast of within the range of from about 85 to 1000F. The temperature of the final dough is brought to a temperature within this range simply by the addition of the hot tap water.Typically, the hottest available tap water can be used with good results. The yeast will preferably be packaged separately from the other ingredients of the dry bread mix and will be blended with them prior to adding the water. The water is then simply added and the combined mixture is stirred briskly until the dough becomes stiff and most of the flour has been mixed in. At this point, it is preferred to take the dough in the hands and to fold and turn it in the bowl to pick up the remaining flour mixture.It is preferred that the step of mixing be terminated upon adherence of substantially all of the flour to the resulting dough and that the dough then be immediately rested without kneading to permit the dry ingredients to hydrate. The rest period will preferably be at least 3 minutes but less than 15 minutes after mixing and prior to shaping. A particularly preferred rest time will be within the range of from 5 to 10 minutes. After the rest period, the dough will have achieved the proper uniform hydration and texture to permit it to be shaped into suitably sized portions for baking. One preferred procedure is to take a weight of dough suitable for preparing a single loaf of bread, to flatten that into a sheet and then to roll the sheet into an approximately cylindrical shape. Looking at the rolled cylinder of dough end wise, it will appear much like a jelly roll.Preferably the free edge of the dough along the length of the roll is pinched to form a seal. The thus suitably portioned dough is then ready for proofing after only from about 15 to about 25 minutes after initially starting the mixing. And, except for the baking pan or sheet, the baker can begin cleanup. The suitably portioned dough is placed in a warm, covered environment for a period of from about 30 to about 45 minutes for proofing. Proofing can be reduced to as low as about 15 minutes when chemical leavening is employed according to the invention. The ambient temperature should be within the range of from about 800 to about 1200F, but a wide tolerence is possible. Where a lower temperature is employed, say on the order of 700F, the proofing time will be somewhat longer, but it will still be possible to stay within the two hour time limit for the complete preparation. Higher temperatures are of no advantage and may decrease yeast activity. Preferably, a proofing time of about 40 minutes will be employed.Thus, the baker can have all utensils, except for that used to hold the dough during proofing cleaned up and he can have the oven preheated to the proper temperature for baking well in advance of the time at which the dough should be placed in the oven for baking.Baking is then done in conventional fashion at a temperature within the range of from about 3750 to about 4250F, preferably about 4000F. Typical baking times will be on the order of from about 30 to about 35 minutes, depending upon the size and shape of the dough portion.Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention The advantages of the bread mix and the process of the invention have been explained above in a manner which is generalized to all of the various types of breads which can be prepared according to the invention. The following several paragraphs will, however, detail specific formulas for preparing a white bread, a French style bread, a rye bread, and a pumpernickel bread according to the invention. These specific formulations, in addition to the broader aspects of the invention described above, are also believed to be novel and to result in surprisingly good bread products. The bread mix according to the invention for preparing French bread will preferably comprise high gluten wheat flour, and sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate as the dough conditioner at a level of from about 0.1 to 0.2 based on the weight of the mix and, the mix will further comprise inactive dry yeast at a level of from about 0.1 to 0.5 also based upon the weight of the mix. In its more preferred aspects, the French bread mix will consist essentially of high gluten wheat flour from about 0.2 to 0.3 inactive dry yeast from about 1.5 to about 2.5 sodium chloride from about 1.5 to 2.5 sugar from about 0.1 to 0.15 sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate and from about 1.75 to 1.95 quick leavening active dry yeast all percentages based upon the weight of the mix. Optionally, the mix will include from 4.24 to 6.4 glucono delta lactone with from 2.0 to 2.44 sodium bicarbonate.The sugar employed will preferably be sucrose, but can comprise corn syrup solids, high fructose corn syrup solids, dextrose, fructose, maltose, and other related sugars normally employed in food products. For preparing a white bread according to the present invention, the flour will preferably comprise high gluten wheat flour, and the dough conditioner will preferably comprise sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate at a level of from about 0.4 to about 0.6 based on the weight of the mix. The white bread mix in its more specific aspects will consist essentially of high gluten wheat flour from about 4 to about 6 sugar from about 1.5 to about 2.5 sodium chloride from about 4 to about 8 granular shortening from about 0.4 to about 0.6 sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate and from about 1.75 to about 1.95 quick leavening active dry yeast all percentages based on the weight of the mix.Optionally, the mix will include from 4.24 to 6.4 glucono delta lactone with from 2.0 to 2.44 sodium bicarbonate. The sugars are similarly defined as those for the French style bread mix. The granular shortening is preferably one prepared by spray drying an emulsion of suitable fat in an aqueous continuous phase containing a suitable encapsulating agent such as a dextrin. Typical of the commercially available granular shortenings which can be employed are Armour Spray Dried Shortening,Code 4200, which is a spray dried emulsion of partially hydrogenated soybean oil, non fat dry milk, mono and diglycerides and an antioxidant andBeatrice Spray Dried Shortening. To prepare a rye bread according to the invention, the bread mix will preferably comprise a blend of high gluten wheat flour and rye flour from about 0.4 to about 0.6 sodium stearoyl 2 lactylate based on the weight of the mix and the mix will further comprise a rye bread flavorant.

Then, with lightly floured hands, the dough is folded and turned in a bowl to pick up the remaining flour mixture. After this, the dough is permitted to rest for 5 minutes. Following resting, the dough is taken from the bowl with floured hands and set on a lightly floured surface where it is shaped into a smooth ball and then flattened by pushing and patting the dough into a rectangle of about 8 by 10 inches in dimensions. The dough is then turned over and again flattened into a smooth sheet. Then, starting at the short side of the rectangle, the dough sheet is rolled up tightly into a cylindrical form in the manner of a jelly roll. The free edge along the length of the roll is then sealed by pinching to form a seam.The roll of dough is then placed seam side down in a greased 81 x 4 x 2 inch loaf pan, covered with a dish towel, and placed in a warm draft free area about 850F for about 40 minutes to allow the dough to rise. Meanwhile, the oven is preheated to 4000F. After the 40 minute proofing period, the towel is removed and the dough is baked at 4000F for about 30 to 35 minutes until the crust is golden brown. The resulting loaf shows a volume of about 2100 ml and shows excellent grain and crumb structure.
