# Apparatus for inspecting a heat exchanger tube.

## Abstract
Apparatus for inspecting relatively long, thin walled, small bore tubes 1 of a heat exchanger, provided with support plates 4 for holding the tubes in predetermined positions, comprises a composite scanner 6 having a plurality of flexure springs contacting the interior surface of a tube 1 for detecting and profiling tube abnormalities 42,43 as the scanner 6 traverses the tube 1 , and an eddy current sensor for generating a unique signal as the scanner 6 passes a contiguous support plate 4 to assist in the accurate location of tube abnormalities 42,43 .
