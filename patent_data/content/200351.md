## Description
This invention relates to a liquid ethylene type random copolymer, a process for its production and its use as a synthetic lubricant oil. More specifically, it relates to a liquid ethylene type random copolymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution and a narrow composition distribution, a process for its production and its use as a lubricant oil. Liquid ethylene alpha olefin copolymers, typically liquid ethylene propylene copolymer, have been expected to find applications as synthetic lubricant oils or various resin modifiers. They are known to be produced by methods comprising copolymerizing ethylene with alpha olefins in the presence of titanium type catalysts composed of titanium compounds and organoaluminum compounds or vanadium type compounds composed of vanadium compounds and organoaluminum compounds. Liquid ethylene alphaolefin copolymers produced in the presence of the titanium type catalysts generally have poor randomness, broad molecular weight and composition distributions, and poor properties for use as synthetic lubricant oils. Liquid ethylene alpha olefin copolymers obtained in the presence of the vanadium type catalysts have higher randomness, narrower molecular weight and composition distributions than the copolymers obtained with the titanium type catalysts, and therefore have fairly improved properties for use as synthetic lubricant oils. It is still desired however to improve the quality of such copolymers for applications which must meet rigorous requirements. Ethylene alpha olefin copolymers obtained with the vanadium type catalysts are proposed, for example, in Japanese Patent Publications Nos. 21650 1972 and 42723 1972, and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publications Nos. 117585 1982, 112809 1976, 65205 1973 and 35009 1985. Japanese Patent Publication No. 21650 1972 and Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 117585 1982 both describe the utilization of liquid ethylene alpha olefin copolymers in synthetic lubricant oils. These copolymers, however, have the unsatisfactory properties mentioned above. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 112809 1976 discloses a viscosity index improver composed of an ethylene propylene copolymer having a weight average molecular weight Catalysts comprising zirconium compounds and aluminoxanes are disclosed in a series of prior art publications as new Ziegler type olefin polymerization catalysts. But these publications fail to give any description which suggests liquid ethylene alpha olefin copolymers. Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 19309 1983 describes a process which comprises polymerizing ethylene and at least one alpha olefin having 3 to 12 carbon atoms at a temperature of 50 C to 200 C in the presence of a catalyst comprising a transition metal containing compound represented by the following formula Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 95292 1984 describes a process for producing a linear aluminoxane represented by the formula Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 35005 1985 discloses a process for producing an olefin polymerization catalyst which comprises reacting an aluminoxane compound represented by the following formula Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 35,006 1985 discloses a combination of a a mono , di or tri cyclopentadienyl of two or more different transition metals or a derivative thereof and b alumoxane aluminoxane as a catalyst for producing a blended polymer in a reactor. Example I of this patent document discloses that polyethylene having a number average molecular weight of 15,300, a weight average molecular weight of 36,400 and a propylene content of 3.4 was obtained by polymerizing ethylene and propylene using bis pentamethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dimethyl and alumoxane as a catalyst. Example 2 of this patent document states that a blend of polyethylene and ethylene propylene copolymer which has a number average molecular weight of 2.000, a weight average molecular weight of 8,300 and a propylene content of 7.1 mole and consists of a toluene soluble portion having a number average molecular weight of 2,200, a weight average molecular weight of 11,900 and a propylene content of 30 mole and a toluene insoluble portion having a number average molecular weight of 3,000, a weight average molecular weight of 7,400 and a propylene content of 4.8 mole was obtained by polymerizing ethylene and propylene using bis pentamethylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride, bis methylcyclopentadienyl zirconium dichloride and alumoxane. Likewise, Example 3 describes a blend of LLDPE and an ethylene propylene copolymer which consists of a soluble portion having a molecular weight distribution Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 35007 1985 discloses a process which comprises polymerizing ethylene alone or with an alpha olefin having at least 3 carbon atoms in the presence of a catalyst comprising a metallocene and a cyclic alumoxane of the following formula Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 35008 1985 describes that by using a catalyst system comprising an alumoxane and at least two metallocenes, polyethylene or a copolymer of ethylene and a C The invention provides a liquid ethylene type random copolymer consisting essentially of units derived from ethylene and an alpha olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms, said copolymer being characterized in that The liquid ethylene type random copolymer of the invention can be produced by copolymerizing ethylene and an alpha olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms in the presence of a catalyst comprising A a compound of a transition metal of Group IVb of the periodic table, and B an aluminoxane.

Preferably, those transition metal compounds which are difficultly soluble in solvents such as toluene for example, bis cyclopentadienyl zirconium monochloride monohydride are used after they are contacted with organoaluminum compounds. This operation renders the sparingly solvent soluble transition metal compounds readily soluble in solvents. Specific example of the organoaluminum compounds to be contacted with the transition metal compounds include trialkyl aluminums such as trimethyl aluminum, triethyl aluminum and tributyl aluminum trialkenyl aluminums such as triisoprenyl aluminum, dialkyl aluminum alkoxides such as dimethyl aluminum methoxide, diethyl aluminum ethoxide and dibutyl aluminum butoxide alky aluminum sesquialkoxides such as methyl aluminum sesquimethoxide and ethyl aluminum sesquiethoxide partially alkoxylated alkyl aluminums having the average composition of the formula Preferably, the reaction of the two compounds is carried out in a hydrocarbon solvent while shutting off light.

The polymerization reaction of the olefins in the process of this invention is usually carried out in a hydrocarbon solvent. Examples of the hydrocarbon solvent used for this purpose are aliphatic hydrocarbons such as butane, isobutane, pentane, hexane, octane, decane, dodecane, hexadecene and octadcane alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclopentane, methtylcyclopentane, cyclohexane and cyclooctane aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene and petroleum fractions such as gasoline, kerosene and light oils. The starting olefins may themselves serve as the hydrocarbon medium. Among these hydrocarbon media, the aromatic hydrocarbons and the starting olefins are preferably used in the process of this invention. The polymerization temperature in the process of this invention is, for example. 50 to 200 C, preferably 30 to 100 C, especially preferably 20 to 80 C. The proportion of the transition metal compound A used in practicing the process of this invention is, for example, 10 When the copolymerization reaction in the process of this invention is carried out in the absence of hydrogen, a liquid ethylene type random copolymer having a high iodine value can be obtained. When it is carried out in the presence of hydrogen, a liquid ethylene type random copolymer having a low iodine value or an iodine value of substantially zero can be obtained. After the polymerization reaction by the process of this invention, the polymerization reaction mixture is worked up in a customary manner to give the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of the invention. When the liquid ethylene type random copolymer having a high iodine value obtained by the aforesaid process is hydrogenated in the presence of a hydrogenating catalyst, a liquid ethylene type random copolymer having a lower iodine value or an iodine value of substantially zero can be obtained. Examples of the hydrogenating catalyst that can be used are metals of Group VIII of the periodic table such as iron, cobalt, nickel, rhodium, palladium and platinum. Of these, nickel is preferred. Raney nickel is especially preferred. The hydrogenation reaction may be carried out in the presence or absence of solvent. Examples of the solvent are hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and cyclooctane. The temperature in the hydrogenation reaction is, for example. 50 to 250 C, preferably 100 to 200 C. The hydrogenation reaction pressure is, for example. in the range of 0.5 to 9.8 MPa G. The liquid ethylene type random copolymer is substantially transparent at 250 C.

The liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention has a molecular weight distribution The molecular weight distribution is measured as follows in accordance with Takeuchi, Gel Permeation Chromatography published by Maruzen Co., Ltd., Tokyo. The measurement is conducted under the following conditions. The liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention has a number average molecular weight Furthermore, the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention has a B value, defined by the following equation I , within the range defined by the following equation II The B value is an index showing the state of distribution of the individual monomer components in the copolymer chain, and can be calculated from P As the B value is larger, the copolymer has higher alternateness between ethylene and alpha olefin and a more uniform distribution of ethylene and alpha olefin and a narrower composition distribution. Preferably, the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention has the following B values. When the copolymer has an ethylene content of not more than 50 mole When the copolymer has an ethylene content of more than 50 mole The B value was determined as follows A sample is prepared by uniformly dissolving about 200 mg of the copolymer in 1 ml of hexachlorobutadiene in a sample tube having a diameter of 10 mm. The In the For example, in the following bond of a copolymer of ethylene and 1 hexene, the three central methylene groups are at the positions of α, β. and γ from left when viewed from the left tertiary carbon derived from 1 hexene, and on the other hand, at the positions of α, β, and γ from right when viewed from the right tertiary carbon. Hence, the above bond unit contains methylene groups which give signals of αγ and ββ, but contains no methylene group which gives signals of αβ and βγ. On the other hand, the following bonds The liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention has an iodine value of 0 to 85, preferably 0 to 50. When the iodine value of the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of the invention is larger than 0, it is a copolymer having a carbon carbon unsaturated bond based on the ethylene units or alpha olefin units at one end of the coopolymer molecule units, or a mixture of a copolymer having a carbon carbon unsaturated bond based on the ethylene units or the alpha olefin units at one end of the copolymer molecule and a copolymer having no carbon carbon unsaturated bond at one end of the copolymer molecule. When the copolymer has an iodine value of zero, it has no unsaturated bond. For use as a lubricant oil, the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention conveniently has an iodine value of 0 to 0.3, preferably 0 to 0.2, especially preferably 0 to 0.1. It is apparent from the foregoing description, in the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention, the direction of bonding of a monomer copolymerizable with ethylene is regular. The liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention usually has a viscosity index of 130 to 350. an ignition point of at least 240 C, and a pour point of not more than 0 C. The liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention has a narrow molecular weight distribution and a composition distribution, and have various excellent properties required of lubricant oils. When compared with copolymers obtained by using vanadium type catalysts, the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention has nearly equal or narrower molecular weight and composition distributions but it differs in the arrangement of ethylene and alpha olefin in the main chain of copolymer and is superior in various properties which are considered necessary to lubricant oils. When the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of the invention is hydrogenated, there is obtained a hydrogenated polymer having a high viscosity index, a high ignition point, a low pour point, excellent shear stability, excellent oxidation stability, excellent thermal stability and high oil film strength. The hydrogenated polymer is used as a synthetic lubricant oil. Furthermore, the liquid ethylene type random copolymer of this invention can be easily modified according to various purposes since it has a double bond capable of reacting with maleic anhydride, etc. at the molecular chain ends.
