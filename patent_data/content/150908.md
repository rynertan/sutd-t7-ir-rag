## Description
This invention relates to the use of curable impregnantcompositions for impregnating electrical appliances. Electrical appliances such as condensers andtransformers, have recently been earnestly required to havea higher voltage resistance, greater capacitance and smallersize than conventional ones. To meet these requirements,there have been proposed impregnation type condensers andtransformers prepared by being impregnated with animpregnant and then cured in order to improve their electriccharacteristics. Further, in connection with saidrequirements, a part or the whole of the insulating materialor dielectric material such as insulating paper for electricappliances has been substituted by plastics. Heretofore, styrene monomer which is one ofaromatic olefins, has been used as an impregnant forelectrical appliances. This monomer is impregnated togetherwith a suitable curing agent such as an organic peroxideand is then cured for use. However, styrene monomer isnot desirable as an impregnant for electrical applianceswherein plastics are used as a dielectric or insulatingmaterial since it has disadvantages such as solubility toplastics. Further, an unsaturated, styrene dimer having twoaromatic rings, such as 1,4 diphenyl butene 1, has beenproposed to be used as one of the ingredients of anelectrical insulating oil for impregnation U.S. Patent 4,347,169 , however, it is used only for impregnation andis not cured when used. Still further, British Patent 855,004 disclosesthat diisopropenyl diphenylmethane or the like which isa diolefin having two aromatic rings is used as a crosslinkingagent for polystyrene, however, this Patentdiscloses nothing about the use of such a diolefin as acurable impregnant, particularly a curable impregnant forelectrical appliances. It is an object of this invention to use acurable impregnant composition for electricinsulation, which composition will sparingly swell plastics when so used,and which composition is suitable for impregnating electrical applianceswherein at least a part of the dielectric or insulatingmaterial is made of plastics. The curable impregnant composition used in thisinvention contains as the curable ingredient an aromaticmonoolefin or diolefin having a plurality two or threefor example of condensed or noncondensed type aromaticrings. For example, aromatic monoolefins or diolefinshaving two aromatic rings are illustrated by the compoundshaving the following general formulae I to III It is preferable that the aromatic olefinsrepresented by the above formulae I to III have amolecular weight of 300 or less. Such aromatic olefins having a molecular weightof more than 300 are not preferred since they are notsatisfactorily curable. In a case where R In a case where R In a case where R In a case where R In addition, R The compounds represented by said general formula I include vinylphenylphenylmethane, vinylphenylphenylethane,propenylphenylphenylmethane, propenylphenylphenylethane,diphenylethylene, diphenylpropene,diphenylbutene and diphenylhexene and also includevinyldiphenylethylene, divinyldiphenylmethane, diisopropenyldiphenylmethane,and vinylphenylindane. The compounds represented by said general formula II include vinylbiphenyl, allylbiphenyl, propenylbiphenyl,cyclohexenylbiphenyl and divinylbiphenyl. The compounds represented by said formula III include vinylnaphthalene, divinylnaphthalene,isopropenylnaphthalene and diisopropenylnaphthalene. The aromatic monoolefins or diolefins having threearomatic rings according to this invention include thosederived from an alkylterphenyl, aralkyldiaryl,diaralkylbenzene, arylnaphthalene, aralkylnaphthalene,alkylanthracene or alkylphenanthren. More specifically,they are illustrated by vinylanthracene and vinylphenanthren.The above aromatic monoolefins or diolefinsmay be used singly or in combination. In addition, they may be incorporated with othercurable ingredients such as monocyclic aromatic olefinsillustrated by styrene, in an optional ratio as far as theformer and latter are compatible with each other. The above aromatic olefins are only examples ofthose which are usable in this invention and, therefore,this invention is not limited to these compounds. Such aromatic olefins may be produced by varioussynthetic chemical methods as indicated below. For example, vinylnaphthalene may be obtainedby reacting formylnaphthalene with a Grignard reagent suchas methyl magnesium iodide and then dehydrating the reactionproduct. Vinylphenylphenylethane may be obtained by reacting diphenylethane with acetyl chloride in the presenceof a Friedel Craft catalyst to produce acetylphenylphenylethane,reducing the thus produced product with sodium boronhydride and then dehydrating the thus reduced product.Isopropenylphenylphenylethane may be obtained by reactingformylphenylphenylethane with a Grignard reagent such asmethyl magnesium iodide and then dehydrating the reactionproduct. 1,2 diphenylethylene may be obtained by reactingbenzaldehyde with benzyl magnesium bromide and thendehydrating the reaction product 1,2 diphenylpropene maylikewise be obtained. The aromatic diolefins used herein may be obtainedfor example by producing a Grignard reagent having a vinylgroup and aromatic ring from bromostyrene, reacting thethus produced reagent with an aromatic ketone such asacetophenone and then dehydrating the alcohol produced. Further, the aromatic olefins used in thisinvention may also be obtained by a method using adehydrogenating, decomposing or like reaction. With respect to a method using a dehydrogenatingreaction, the aromatic olefins used in this invention maybe obtained by dehydrogenating in the presence of a suitabledehydrogenating catalyst a saturated aromatic hydrocarboncorresponding to the aromatic monoolefin used in thisinvention, or a saturated aromatic hydrocarbon or aromaticmonoolefin corresponding to the aromatic diolefin used inthis invention while inhibiting side reactions such as decomposition and polymerization. The dehydrogenating catalysts are not particularlylimited but any such catalysts may be used. The dehydrogenating catalysts include oxides ofmetals such as Cr, Fe, Cu, K, Mg and Ca, the oxides beingused singly or in combination, and also include noble metalssuch as Pt and Pd. These metal oxides and noble metalsmay be carried on a carrier such as alumina for use as adehydrogenating catalyst. The dehydrogenating reaction is carried out at350 650 C, preferably 400 600 C, and the LHSV is 0.2 1.0,preferably 0.5 3.0. Further, steam, nitrogen, hydrogenand like gases may be present in the dehydrogenation systemto decrease partial pressures and or prevent carbondeposition. A suitable diluent may further be used in thedehydrogenation as required, however, if the dehydrogenationis mildly carried out without requiring a very highdehydrogenation rate, then it will be convenient that thefeedstock itself can usually be a diluent. By such dehydrogenation, diphenylethylene maybe obtained from diphenylethane, and vinylphenylphenylethane,ethylphenyl phenylethylene andvinylphenyl phenylethylene may respectively be obtainedfrom ethylphenyl phenylethane. In addition,isopropenylbiphenyl may likewise be obtained fromisopropylbiphenyl, and isopropenyl isopropylnaphthalene,diisopropenylnaphthalene and the like may be obtained from diisopropylnaphthalene. Further, the aromatic olefins used in this inventionmay be obtained by the decomposing reaction, such as thethermal cracking or catalytic cracking, of for example atriarylalkane, diaralkyl aromatic hydrocarbon, styrenepolymer or the like. These polymers as the starting material, may bepyrolyzed at a temperature of 300 700 C, preferably330 600 C. The use of too low a pyrolyzing temperaturewill retard the decomposition velocity, whereas the useof too high a pyrolyzing temperature will decompose thestarting material to the extent that monocyclic aromatichydrocarbons are produced therefrom. It is thereforepreferable to shorten the contact time in a high temperatureregion as far as possible in order to obtain aromatichydrocarbons in a good yield. The catalytic reaction may be carried out in aliquid or gaseous phase at a reaction temperature of300 700 C, preferably 330 600 C, using silica gel,silica alumina, kaolin, dealuminized or non dealuminizedzeolite, or inorganic or organic sulfonic acid as thecatalyst. The aforesaid aromatic olefins may be used inthis invention. However, among these various aromaticolefins, preferred one is an olefin having at least onemono substituted type double bond or di substituted typedouble bond in which the one and two substituents are attached to the same carbon atom on the double bondrespectively. Particularly preferred is an olefin havingat least one mono substituted type double bond, that is,vinyl group. Such a preferred aromatic olefin is preferablesince it is easily curable. It is preferable that the aromatic olefins usedin this invention be in the liquid state at an ambienttemperature from the view point of their impregnation orfilling up. However, they may be from viscous to solidat ambient temperature if they melt to flow so easilyas to be handled without difficulty at an elevatedtemperature at which they are impregnated or filled up.In addition, they may be used together with a plasticizer,softening agent, filler, extender and other additive whichare compatible therewith, and the resulting mixture maybe viscous or solid at ambient temperature if it is madeliquid at an elevated temperature at which it is impregnatedor filled up. The curable impregnant composition used in thisinvention may contain at least one of the aromatic olefinsin such an amount that the composition is satisfactorilycurable although the amount of the olefin or olefinscontained is not particularly limited. The compositionusually contains the olefin or olefins in an amount byweight of at least 5 , preferably at least 10 , thereof. The impregnant composition used in this invention maycomprise, besides the aromatic olefins, plasticizers, softening agents, fillers, extender and resins if theseadditives are compatible with the aromatic olefins. The plasticizers or softening agents includepolybutene, phthalic acid esters such as DOP, animal andvegetable oils such as castor oil, alkylbenzene,diarylalkanes such as phenylxylylethane and benzyltoluene,triarylalkanes, alkylbiphenyls, terphenyl, alkylnaphthalenesand diaralkyl aromatic hydrocarbon such as dibenzyltoluene. The resins used as an extender or the like includelow molecular weight polymers which are illustrated bypolymers polymerized with monomers containing mainlyaromatic olefins such as low molecular weight polystyrene,petroleum resins such as C These low molecular weight polymers may be addedto the aromatic olefins of this invention in an amount byweight of up to 300 parts per 100 parts by weight of theolefins. The above polymers, per se, are not used as animpregnant since they are normally solid or semi solid,and they will not make a satisfactory impregnant even ifthey are mixed with a plasticizer or softener. The impregnant composition used in this invention mayfurther be incorporated with inorganic fillers such assilica, calcium carbonate, talc and aluminum hydroxide. The said composition may still further beincorporated with a conventional known flame retardant suchas tricresylphosphate, trixylylphosphate or triphenylphosphineoxide. It is preferable that the curable impregnantcomposition used in the present invention be in the liquid stateat ambient temperature from the viewpoint of theirimpregnation or filling up. However, they may be fromviscous to solid at an ambient temperature if they meltto flow so easily as to be handled without difficulty atan elevated temperature at which they are impregnated orfilled up. The curable impregnant composition used in thisinvention is suitable for impregnating or filling upelectrical appliances therewith. Electrical appliances to be impregnated with theimpregnant composition used in this invention, are transformers,condensers and the like. These condensers include thoseprepared by winding metallic foil as electrode and at leastone film selected from paper, plastics films such aspolypropylene, polyester, polycarbonate and composite filmsthereof. In addition, the condensers prepared by windingup metallized paper or plastics films MF condenser , themetal such as aluminum or zinc being vapor deposited onone or both sides of the paper or plastics film, are alsoincluded. Impregnants for use for the above MF condensers are required to have more specified properties than thosefor ordinary condensers having metallic foils as anelectrode layer since the vapor deposited metallic layeris apt to be peeled from the base film in the MF condensers.However, the curable impregnant composition used in thisinvention is particularly suitable for such MF condensers. In addition, the curable impregnant compositionsused in this invention are sparingly soluble and swelling inplastics typified by polyolefin prepared by polymerizingan aliphatic olefin, the polyolefin being illustrated bypolypropylene, polyethylene or polymethylpentene.Accordingly, they may impregnate or fill up therewithelectrical appliances in which at least a part of thedielectric or insulating elements is made of such plastics. The impregnation may be effected in a conventionalknown manner. For example, the elements of electricalappliances, such as the element of condensers capacitors ,may be impregnated by dipping the element in a suitablyheated impregnant. In a case where the electrical appliancehas a case in which the element is housed, an impregnant,suitably heated if required, may be filled in the case forimpregnating the element. The impregnant composition used in this invention isimpregnated and then treated by a suitable means tochemically cure the aromatic olefin or olefins containedin the composition. As curing means, there are a curing method using heat, a curing method using light radiation such asultraviolet radiation, a curing method using electron beamradiation, and the like. Any one of them may be used inthis invention. It is preferable to add an initiator such as anorganic peroxide in order to cure by heating. The organicperoxides which may be used herein, include acyl peroxidessuch as benzoyl peroxide and acetyl peroxide, hydroperoxides such as tert. butyl peroxide and cumeneperhydroxyoxide, alkyl peroxides such as methyl ethyl ketoneperoxide and cyclohexanone peroxide, and oxy peroxides suchas tert. butyl perbenzoate and tert. butyl peroxyacetate. These organic peroxides may be used in an amountby weight of 0.1 10 parts, preferably 0.5 7 parts, per 100parts by weight of the aromatic olefin according to thisinvention. The thermal cure may be effected at usually70 120 C for about 5 20 hours. It is also preferable to use an initiator incuring by the radiation of light. Such curing agentsinclude benzoin ethyl ether, di tert. butyl peroxide,azobisisobutyronitrile and dibenzothiazolyl sulfide. Among said various curing methods, the thermalcuring method is the most preferable since it is simpleand convenient. This invention will be better understood by thefollowing Examples and Comparative Examples. In addition, processes for preparing difficulty available aromatic olefins are indicated below forreference. Diethylbiphenyl was dehydrogenated in the presenceof steam under the following conditions thereby to obtaina liquid dehydrogenated product containing an aromaticolefin. The thus obtained dehydrogenated product containedvinylethylbiphenyl and divinylbiphenyl, and the olefincontent thereof was found to be 73.3 wt. in terms ofmonoolefins from the fact that the product had a brominevalue of 55.0 cg g. Two hundred and fifty 250 ml of driedtetrahydrofuran were incorporated with 14.6 g 0.601 mol of magnesium and then further incorporated dropwise with100 g 0.546 mol of p bromostyrene while heating to 65 Cthereby obtaining a Grignard reagent. The thus obtainedreagent was cooled to 20 C and then incorporated dropwisewith 65.5 g 0.546 mol of acetophenone to react themtogether. The resulting reaction mixture was introducedinto a mixture of 500 g of crushed ice, 500 g of water and15 ml of 98 sulfuric acid and then extracted with etherto obtain an alcohol which was the reaction product. Thethus obtained alcohol was dehydrated with potassium hydrogensulfate to obtain 62.8 g yield 56 of normally liquid1 phenyl 1 4 vinylphenyl ethylene which was the endproduct. This end product had a boiling point of 151 C 10 mm Hg 13,332 mbar or 114 C 2 mm Hg 2,6664 mbar and the structure thereofwas confirmed by NMR spectra and IR spectra. A metallized film prepared by vapor depositingaluminum on an easy to impregnate type 9 µm thick orientedpropylene film, was wound up to obtain a condenser capacitor element having an electrostatic capacity of3.5 µF. The thus obtained element was subjected at boththe ends to metallikon spray by molten spray with zincand lead wires were then soldered to the ends, after whichthe element was placed in a resin case. The resin case was then filled up and impregnatedwith a normally liquid impregnant composition comprising phenyl 4 vinylphenyl methane as the impregnant and 2 wt. ,based on the impregnant, of 1,1 bis t. butylperoxy 3,3,5 trimethylcyclohexane Tradename PERHEXA 3M as theinitiator. The impregnant composition filled in the casewas heated to 95 C for 15 hours after the impregnation tocure the composition. The composition so cured was notfluidized at all even at 85 C. The condenser thus obtained was measured for thetime taken prior to its breakdown by applying theretoelectric charge at 630V at room temperature, with the resultthat the breakdown did not occur at least 100 hours afterthe start of the measurement. A normally viscous liquid impregnant compositioncomprising 35 wt. of phenyl 4 vinylphenyl methane, 63wt. of a C The condenser element housed resin case condenser so obtained was subjected to condenser breakagetest in the same manner as in Example 1, with the result that the condenser was not broken even after the applicationthereto of electric charge for at least 100 hours. The procedure of Example 1 was followed exceptthat styrene was substituted for the phenyl 4 vinylphenyl methanewhich was a bicyclic aromatic olefin. The styrenewas polymerized and was not fluidized at 85 C. The condenser so obtained was charged andsubjected to condenser breakage test in the same manneras in Example 1, with the result that the condenser wasbroken two minutes after the start of application of thecharge. The reason for this is considered to be that thestyrene enabled the polypropylene to be easily swollen andthe metal film formed by vapor deposition was peeled wherebythe condenser degraded in performance. The procedure of Example 2 was followed exceptthat in Example 3 α vinylnaphthalene was substituted forthe phenyl 4 vinylphenyl methane which was a bicyclicaromatic olefin, in Example 4 the dehydrogenated productobtained in Preparation 1 was substituted for thephenyl 4 vinylphenyl methane and in Example 51 phenyl 1 4 vinylphenyl ethylene obtained inPreparation 2 was substituted for the phenyl 4 vinylphenyl methane,whereby a normally liquid impregnantcomposition was obtained in each of Examples 3 5. Each of the impregnant compositions so obtained was filled in the resin case to impregnate the condenserelement therein, after which the composition so impregnatedwas thermally cured. The composition after heated was notfluidized even at 85 C, this proving that the compositionin each resin case was cured. The condensers thus obtained were each chargedat room temperature and tested for its breakage, with theresult that none of the condensers were broken even at least100 hours after the start of the test.
