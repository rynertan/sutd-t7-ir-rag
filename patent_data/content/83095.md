# METHOD OF REDUCTIVELY WAVING OR STRAIGHTENING HAIR

## Abstract
A method of reductively waving or straightening hair is disclosed in which a first composition containing a reducing agent capable of breaking hair disulfide is applied to the hair and maintained in contact with the hair to form partially reduced hair. The first composition is rinsed from the hair, and the temperature of the hair is raised and maintained at from about 35 C. to about 100 C., followed by neutralization to rebuild the hair disulfide bonds.
