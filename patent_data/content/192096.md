# Rotary drive coupling.

## Abstract
A flexible coupling includes a quadrilateral, flex member 10 , which coupling rotatably couples a driving shaft 38 to a driven shaft 60 and accommodates endwise, parallel or angular misalignment between the shafts. The flex member includes corner portions 28,29,30,31 each having one substantially aligned face and a raised face 80,81,82,83 created by thickening of each corner portion. The substan tally aligned faces of two diagonally opposed corner portions face in one generally axially direction and the substantially aligned faces of the other corner portions face in a direction generally opposite to that of the substantially aligned faces of the two diagonally opposed corner portions to minimize the endwise spacing required between the driving shaft and the driven shaft needed to insert the coupling. The decreased endwise spacing minimizes the bending moment on the flex member and facilitates the indentification of the proper assembly orientation of the flex member within the flexible coupling. The decreased endwise spacing also increases the lateral stiffness of the coupling arrangement, and the maximum operating speed of the coupling.
