## Description
Method and apparatus for labelling articles. This invention relates to a method of marking articles, so that the mark is protected from external influences.In particular the invention relates to the marking of textile articles with labels resistant to washing and dry cleaning. A similar method is known from Netherlands patent application 66,02837. In it, information protected by at least one transparent cover layer is applied to an article to be marked by applying the information and subsequently, by means of heat and pressure, affixing a transparent cover layer supplied on a temporary backing to the article to be marked. In the prior method, first an underlayer, supplied on a temporary backing, is pressed on to the article to be marked, whereafter variable information is applied, and subsequently the cover layer, also supplied on a temporary backing, is affixed to overlie the underlayer. The underlayer may be provided with a preprint on the side facing the temporary backing, and the cover layer may be provided with a preprint on the side away from the temporary backing. In the prior process, the variable information may be applied to the underlayer, possibly supplementing information applied by way of a preprint, after the underlayer has been applied to the article to be marked, and after the removal of the temporary backing therefrom, and subsequently the transparent cover layer is placed over it by way of protection. A pre printed symbol, for example a trademark, may also be applied, in mirror image, to the side of the transparent cover layer that is not covered by the temporary backing. Irrespective of whether fully or partially preprinted label components are used, any variable information is always applied, in the prior process, to the underlayer, and this after the latter has been affixed to the article to be marked, and naturally after the temporary backing has been removed from it. The application of variable information gives no problem so long as the information is of such a simple nature that it can be applied in handwriting or by means of an easily variable stamp, and if use is made of printing inks which can adhere to the surface of the underlayer which after the removal of the temporary backing is often smooth. There are conditions, however, for example in laundries, in linen hiring firms and the like, in which it is desirable to apply complicated markings, for example, individual data of customers in the form of a so called bar code.The numbers involved are often small, so that pre printed label components are unsuitable. Moreover, the application of bar code and other complicated markings require a special printing head, which needs a flat face for printing in order to produce. a sharply delineated marking. Accordingly, marking with such a printing head gives problems in printing an underlayer already affixed to a piece of textile. In the method according to the present invention, such problems in applying variable information to articles are avoided by the improvement which consists in that the transparent cover layer, while still being adhered to the temporary backing, is supplied to a printing head, provided with a marking inmirror image on thefree sidethereof, supplied to the article to be marked by means of said temporary backing, and attached to said article. The labelling method according to the invention has been found in practice to be suitable for applying complicated variable information with sufficient clearness and sharpness to ensure reliable reading, also in the case of information in the form of a bar code on textile, after repeated washing or dry cleaning. The cover layer, often of thermoplastic material, has been found after being affixed to a textile article by means of heat and pressure to impregnate the textile material sufficiently to protect the information markings from external, chemical and similar influences. Indeed, an underlayer as used in the prior method is only needed if a contrasting background is desirable. In a further feature according to the invention, in order to simplify the method steps in applying identification markings between underlayers and cover layers supplied by temporary backings, which are affixed by means of heat and pressure, according to the present invention at least one pair of associated underlayer and cover layer sheets are supplied on a common backing, the cover layer is printed with the desired information, and the underlayer and the cover layer are sequentially affixed to an article to be marked one to overlie the other For carrying out the labelling method, the invention provides a labelling apparatus comprising a press with heating means and guide means for guiding a continuous temporary backing of label components from a supply roll along a computer controlled printing head arranged to print information symbols, such as a bar code, in accordance with variable information supplied to the computer, and subsequently guiding the label components along the press, and further comprising signalling means which in response to markings on said continuous temporary backing control said printing head and said press. In this way an article, such as a piece of clothing in a laundry, can be marked by entering the desired information into the computer, thereby the printing head is set at a corresponding bar code, and this code is printed in mirror image on the free side of a label cover layer supplied by the temporary backing, which during this step can rest on a suitable flat support. Subsequently the cover layer thus printed in situ is supplied to the Dress. The piece of clothing to be marked then only needs to be introduced into the press for the label to be applied to a desired location thereof. For use in the labelling apparatus according to the invention, there is provided a continuous strip of material comprising a continuous backing carrying a sequence of label components, either exclusively transparent cover layer sheets, or an alternation of cover layer sheets and underlayer sheets and markings for signalling means controlling the movement of the backing through a labelling apparatus. One embodiment of the labelling apparatus according to the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings. In said drawings, Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic side elevational view of the labelling apparatus Fig. 2 shows a detail as shown by the arrow II II of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing a label with a partially Feeled off cover layer. Referring to the drawings there is shown a labelling apparatus comprising a label press with a stationary section 1 and a section 3 movable up and down by means of a pneumatic cylinder 2. The stationary press section 1 carries a heatable press plate 4, and the movable press section 3 carries a heatable press plate 5. A temporary backing 6 for label components, which will be described in more detail hereinafter, is guided by guide rollers7, 8, 9 and 10 from a supply roll 11 along a driven pressure roller 12, between the press plates 4 and 5 and to a reel 13. The pressure roller 12 cooperates with a printing head 14 The apparatus is controlled by a computer 15 by means of photocells 16 and 16 . In the embodiment shown, the apparatus is designed to label textile articles 21 with a label composed of an under layer 17 which. can be affixed to the textile article 21 by hot pressingt for exampler owing to the underlayer being made of thermoplastic material, and further a transparent cover layer 18, which can also be affixed by hot pressing.These label components 17 and 18 are sequentially affixed to the temporary backing formed by a continuous strip 6 made of, or coated with, a material having such characteristics that sheets 17 and 18 can easily be peeled off from it.At the position of each underlayer 17, backing 6 is provided in. each of its marginal zones with markings 19 and 20.At the position of a cover layer sheet 18, a marking 19 has been applied only, and marking 20 is absent. The labelling apparatus operates as follows. In the situation as shown in Fig. 1, an article to be labelled, such as the textile article 21, shown diagrammatically, is positioned on the stationary, heated press plate 4. The movable press plate 5 is in the raised position. Positioned. between the pressure roller 12 and the printing head 14, on backing 6, is a transparent cover layer sheet 18, and an underlayer sheet 17 is present in the bagging portion between the printing head 14 and pressure plate 4. Depending on the length of the backing track over roller 8, 9 and 2, an underlayer sheet 17 is, for example, positioned at photocells 16, 16 , which is detected by the two cells 16 and 16 sensing a marking 20 and 19, respectively.This information is passed to computer 15. After the entry of the variable information intended for the article 21 into the computer, the labelling apparatus is put into operation. Computer 15 controls printing head 14, which prints the variable information, possibly translated into a bar code, on the cover layer sheet present on the printing roller, in mirror image, whereafter the printing roller 12 is driven so that the underlayer 17 is transferred to the appropriate place over press plate 14. At this moment an underlayer sheet 17 is present on the printing roller, and the presence of a cover layer sheet 18 is detected at the photocells. The press plate 5 is now lowered, and the underlayer 17 is pressed into the article 21. The press plate 5 is moved upwards again, and, without the printing head 14 having meanwhile become operative, the pressure roller 12 is again driven to position the earlier printed cover layer sheet 18 over the. underlayer. sheet 17 already affixed to the article 21 Press plate 15 is again lowered and presses the cover layer sheet 18 onto the underlayer 17. The label is now completed and after press plate 5 has been raised, article 21 can be removed. The empty backing is continually wound on reel 13. The apparatus is ready for a next labelling operation. It is clear that the invention is not limited to the exemplary embodiment of the apparatus as described.Thus other detection methods can be used, and also the stepwise movement of backing 6 with. label components 17 and may. be different, for example, so that at. the moment when a cover. layer sheet 18 is printed simultaneously an underlayer sheet 17 is pressed on to an article 21. Also, under certain conditions, underlayer sheets 17 can be omitted altogether, for example, in case the color of the article to be labelled contrasts sufficiently with the marking symbols to be applied, and an underlayer exclusively serving for such contrast is redundant.
