# CLONING VECTORS FOR USE IN STREPTOMYCES AND RELATED ORGANISMS

## Abstract
The present invention discloses selectable recombinant DNA cloning vectors comprising a a functional origin of replication containing restric tion fragment of plasmid pEL103, and b one or more DNA segments that convey resistance to at least one antibiotic when transformed into a sensitive host cell, said host cell being susceptible to transformation, cell division, and culture, for use in Streptomyces and related organisms.
