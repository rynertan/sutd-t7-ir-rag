# Method of producing solid potassium dipropionate.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a process for producing solid potassium dipropionate by mixing an aqueous solution of neutral potassium propionate with an equimolar propor tion of propionic acid and cooling the mixture. In the process propionic acid is mixed with the aqueous solution containing at least 85 w w of the neutral propionate at a temperature above 30 C, the mixture is cooled to a temperature of 30 C or less to enable the solid dipropionate to crystallise and the dipropionate is thereafter recovered.

## Description
METHOD OF PRODUCING SOLID POTASSIUM DIPROPIONATE The present invention relates to a method of producing solid potassium dipropionate. Potassium dipropionate, also known as potassium monohydrogen propionate is a complex acid salt containing one mole of propionate ion and one mole of propionic acid per mole of potassium ion.Aqueous solutions of potassium dipropionate and the use thereof as a preservative is claimed and described in British PatentSpecification No 1505388. Solid acid salts are more difficult to prepare because of their inherent instability. For instance sodium dipropionate rapidly loses a mole of propionic acid when exposed to atmosphere leaving the neutral, sodium propionate salt behind.Moreover, the acid salts when produced are not free flowing unless precautions are taken during preparation and storage of the complex acid salts. GB 1473447 discloses a method of producing complex acid salts of this type by preparing a fluidised bed of the solid neutral salt and spraying the solid neutral salt in the fluidised bed with the free acid. The process is cumbersome because it involves using vapours of the free acid which is relatively corrosive and also possesses an unpleasant odour. It hays now been found that problems involving the use of free acid vapours may be mitigated by using a combination of solutions which.is subsequently cooled to allow crystallisation of the complex acid salts. Accordingly, the present invention is a process for producing solid potassium dipropionate said process comprising mixing an aqueous solution of neutral potassium propionate with an equimolar proportion of propionic acid and cooling the mixture, characterised in that the propionic acid is mixed with the aqueous solution containing at least 85 w w of the neutral propionate at a temperature above 90 C, the mixture is cooled to a temperature of 300C or less to enable the solid dipropionate to crystallise and the dipropionate is thereafter recovered. The aqueous solution containing more than 85 w w, preferably from 85 to 90 w w of the neutral propionate is preferably prepared by dissolving neutral potassium propionate which is free of any water of crystallisation either in water or in a relatively dilute aqueous solution of the neutral propionate. The neutral potassium propionate free from water of crystallisation is a desirable starting material because potassium propionate normally crystallises with one mole of water of crystallisation and such crystals are difficult to redissolve in water unless high temperatures are used. Moreover direct evaporation of dilute aqueous solutions of the neutral propionate to produce a concentrated aqueous solution containing more than 85 w w of the neutral salt is difficult because at about 80 concentration the solution becomes viscous and the neutral salt monohydrate begins to separate which is difficult to redissolve. Moreover, the viscosity of the solution increases sharply thereby making continued stirring and evaporation of the solution difficult. Hence the use of a neutral salt free of water of crystallisation is preferred. The neutral salt free from water of crystallisation may be prepared by spray drying an aqueous solution of the neutral salt.The relatively dilute aqueous solution used for this purpose suitably has a neutral salt content of less than 85 w w preferably from 40 to 60X w w, most preferably from 45 to 55 wiw. The neutral salt so produced though slightly moist is substantially free of water of crystallisation and dissolves easily in water. Thus to produce an aqueous solution containing more than 85Z w w of the neutral salt, the solid neutral salt free of water of crystallisation may be dissolved either as such in water to derive the appropriate concentration or may be mixed with the appropriate amount of a previously prepared relatively dilute aqueous solution of the neutral salt which was used for the spray drying stage. The concentrated aqueous solution of the neutral salt so produced and having a neutral salt content of above 85 w w is then mixed with an equimolar amount of propionic acid at a temperature above 30 C, typically from 55 to 650C. When the mixing is complete, the resultant mixture is cooled down to a temperature of 30 C or less, preferably from 20 to 300C thereby enabling solid, crystalline potassium dipropionate to separate. The product dipropionate is thereafter separated and recovered by conventional techniques. The product thus produced is a crystalline solid, which is free flowing and is stable. The solid potassium dipropionate can be used as a preservative, either alone or admixed with other adjuvants in human foods and in animal feed stuff s. The present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following Example.Example Solid crystalline potassium dipropionate was produced as follows a Aqueous potassium hydroxide 50 w w solution was reacted with propionic acid to form an aqueous solution of neutral potassium propionate 50 w w . b A portion of the solution from a above was spray dried to form neutral potassium propionate powder substantially free from water of crystallisation. c The solid, powder form b of the neutral salt was mixed with the remaining aqueous solution from a after step b at 900C so as to form a concentrated aqueous solution of neutral potassium propionate 86 w w . d To the concentrated aqueous solution in c was added an equimolar proportion of propionic acid and thoroughly mixed at about 600C. e The mixture from d was cooled down to about 300C when crystals of potassium dipropionate separated. The crystals were recovered by centrifugation and drying.
