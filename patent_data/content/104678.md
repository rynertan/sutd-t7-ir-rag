# Bracket for shelf frameworks.

## Abstract
A bracket, particularly for interconnecting a shelf 2 and a gable 1 comprises a transverse channel 7 for the shelf 2 and an aperture 6 , which opens into said channel, for a screw 4 by means of which the shelf is intended to be connected to the gable. To reduce the strain on the transverse end edges of the shelf when it is subjected to forces in its longitudinal direction the extension of the bracket 3 , when measured perpendicularly to the shelf 2 , is at least two and preferably more than three times as great as the thickness of the shelf. On that side of the bracket which in the operaoperative position is turned away from the shelf 2 and faces the gable 1 , the bracket has a preferably central recess for restricting the engagement between the bracket 3 and the gable 1 to those marginal portions 9 of the bracket which are located farthest away from the shelf 1 .
