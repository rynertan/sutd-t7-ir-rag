# Forming of tetrabasic lead sulfate battery electrodes.

## Abstract
A method of forming battery plates or electrodes from tetrabasic lead sulfate includes the step of adding a lead peroxide such as lead dioxide in powdered form to the tet rabasic lead sulfate for making the paste to be applied to the plate or electrode supporting grids. The addition of this lead peroxide allows forming the plates or electrodes in an electro lyte of high specific gravity, and in reduced time, with increased efficiency and reduced energy consumption. Such battery plates or electrodes may thus be formed in their final containers or jars, significantly reducing the practical prob lems of disposing of used forming electrolyte solution.
