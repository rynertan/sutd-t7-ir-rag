## Description
This invention relates to the field of cleaning devices, and more particularly relates to a new and improved automatic cleaning device having improved electro mechanical characteristics for cleaning, polishing, scrubbing or the like. In the preferred form illustrated, the device embodies a periodontal e.g. tooth brush device constructed and arranged to reduce oral debris, calculus formation, and periodontal disease. The present invention constitutes a modification of applicant assignees prior United States Patent No. 4,156,620 granted May 29, 1979. Such patent constitutes a continuation in part of Serial No. 489,812, filed July 18, 1974, now abandoned. Heretofore, it has been known to provide various types of powered brush devices for cleaning, polishing, scrubbing or the like. Such devices have formal application, for example , in cleaning, polishing, and scrubbing items including cuticles, jewelry, housewares e.g. utensils , teeth or the like wherein there is a need to treat small and or relatively inexcessible surfaces which are curved as well as flat. In cleaning teeth for example, prior powered tooth brushes have included tufts and bristles moved in a rotary, arcuate, reciprocating, or orbital path by a power mechanism and on larger paths by hand movement. Another design includes powered brushes in which the brush head is substantially stationary and individual tufts are mechanically rotated along their own axis but unidirectionally. Such prior powered brushes, for example, are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,215,031 to N. Elmore wherein the individual tufts of the brush head continuously rotate in one direction. Because of this unidirectional rotation, the individual tufts of these bristles tend to run out of the crevices between large surfaces of teeth. In the mouth, the interproximal crevices and irregularly shaped openings make it difficult to insert the tufts of the brush into the crevices at right angles due to the curvature of the dental arch. This tendency to move out of a crevice of indentation impairs the cleaning efficiency of the toothbrush because the tuft is difficult to position within a crevice for an amount of time adequate to achieve removal of foreign matter deposited within the crevice. In applicant assignees prior U.S. Patent No. 4,156,620, the electric toothbrush disclosed includes means for rotating at least one tuft about its central axis in a controlled reciprocating manner whereby adjacent tuft is rotated a predetermined number of turns in one direction and then rotated a predetermined number of turns in the opposite direction relative to an adjacent tuft. More specifically and as disclosed in said prior patent, in a preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a plurality of tufts of filaments, and each of the tufts is rotated about its own axis in a controlled and predetermined manner. In particular, each tuft is rotated in a controlled reciprocal fashion and immediately adjacent tufts are counter rotated. The tufts are rotated about their central axis in a first direction from a generally neutral position of maximum projected length to a position of maximum filament twist so that the projected length of the tuft diminishes and the tuft is stiffened for effective power transmission, and the tufts are reciprocally rotated about their central axis from the position of maximum filament twist. The last step of reciprocal rotation moves the filaments in each reciprocating cycle from a position of maximum twist in a first direction and a minimum projected length to a position of maximum twist in a second direction in generally the same minimum projected length, and then back to a position of maximum twist in a first direction and a minimum projected length while three times passing through a general neutral position of maximum projected length. This matter produces a sweeping action as well as a pumping action to force the tuft filaments into a positive gripping the work surface whether it be curved or flat resulting in an effective cleaning thereof. As in said prior patent and to enable confining of the tufts on the work surface or, for example, within the interproximal crevices for a period long enough to attain thorough cleaning, each individual tuft is reciprocally rotated. In a periodontal application, for example, this rotation is commenced in one angular direction for a distance sufficient to produce both effective energy transfer and lateral movement of the tuft across the interproximal crevice to clean both approximal mesial and distal surfaces, but less than the amount which would give rise to run out of the tuft and expulsion from the interproximal crevice. Then each tuft is rotated in the opposite angular direction, again just far enough to produce the same cleaning results with effective energy transfer while avoiding expulsion of the tuft from the work surface whether it be flat or curved, such as in an interproximal tooth crevice. In the periodontal application of said prior patent, and in addition to the mesial and distal surfaces noted above, each tooth has a facial and a lingual surface, all four of which define the vertical surfaces of a tooth crown. Because the gingival margins of the interproximal crevices, usually defined by the interdental papilla, and the gingival margins of the raised facial and lingual tooth surfaces between the approximal surfaces are vertically staggered, the tufts are also preferably arranged in a staggered relationship in each row of tufts. A first set of long tufts may be positioned along a first line in the brush head and a second set of shorter tufts may be positioned along a second line in the brush head generally parallel to and spaced from the first line. Within this staggered arrangement, the long tufts reach into interproximal crevices of the teeth, and the shorter tufts clean the raised face areas of the teeth near the gingival. Another desirable characteristic of the applicant assignees prior patented brush is that there is reduced vibratory movement of the brush head itself. Therefore, the brush head can be moved slowly and gently over the tooth surfaces and adjacent gingiva. The entire head of the brush does not oscillate, rotate, move in circular or elliptical paths, or become involved in any movement other than that imparted by the user. This characteristic is particularly important in cleaning teeth because the amount of cleaning motion that can be imparted to a moving brush head cannot be large enough to cause so called cheek shake by action of the brush head in moving against the inner surfaces of the cheek. In the dental field and for reference to prior manual and or electric toothbrush devices, attention is brought to the following patents Accordingly, though prior automatic type toothbrushes have been referred to by way of example, it is to be understood that these and other related problems in the cleaning of teeth also may be present in other cleaning, polishing, scrubbing or like applications. Such may be case with workpieces, such as cuticles, jewelry, housewares, or the like, particularly in cleaning applications where brush accessibility and or brush run out is a problem. The present invention provides an improved cleaning device which is a modification of the aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,156,620. The present invention is preferably used as a periodontal device, but may be adapted for use in other cleaning, polishing, scrubbing or similar applications.

Figure 1 is a front elevation view of the automatic cleaning device of the present invention Referring now again to the drawings, and more particularly to Figures 1 and 2 thereof, there is illustrated the automatic cleaning device, designated generally at 2, of the invention, and which is adapted for use as a portable, hand held device for cleaning, polishing, scrubbing or the like. Though such device may be used for other various cleaning applications, it has been found to be particularly effective as a motor driven, tooth brush for removing debris and plaque from exposed tooth surfaces. Such cleaning application is disclosed in applicant assignees prior U.S. Patent No. 4,156,620, the disclosure of which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. In the embodiment shown, the cleaning device 2 is illustrated for particular application as a motor driven tooth brush, and includes a hollow housing, as at 4, having a handle member 6 with a male re charger portion 26, and a brush head member 8 which may be attached together in sealed relation via a washer seal, as at 10. At one end the brush head member 8 includes an integral brush head portion 12, and at the other end a switch assembly, designated generally at 14. The brush head portion 12 further includes a plurality of tufts 16 and 18 which are reciprocably, counter rotated by the new and improved drive train assembly, as will hereinafter be more fully described. In the embodiment illustrated, the tufts are preferably made from a polymeric material, such as nylon, and include a series of longer 16 and shorter 18 tufts which may be disposed, in two rows Figure 1 with there being, for example, six long tufts and four short tufts. These long and shorts tufts are preferably disposed in a staggered orientation along the brush head portion 12 to provide improved cleaning in periodontal use, for example, of the interproximal tooth crevices, as disclosed in afore mentioned U.S. Patent No. 4,156,620. As best illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, a drive motor 20 is powered by a battery pack 22, which may be of the nickel cadmium type for ready charging via a secondary voltage coil 24 incapsulated in an integral male socket portion 26 of the handle portion 6. This socket portion 26 is detachably received in a corresponding female socket portion, as at 28 in Figure 17, provided in a charger base assembly 30 having a primary charging coil. An electrical circuit is defined with one side of the secondary coil 24 attached to a negative battery terminal connector 32 Figure 4 . The other side of the secondary coil 24 is coupled through a diode 33 to the positive battery terminal 32a. The diode rectifies voltage outputs from the coil 24. A second electrical circuit includes the battery 22, motor 20 and switch 14. The negative battery terminal 32 is coupled to the switch 14 by a conductor 31. This switch 14 selectively energizes the motor 20 by coupling the battery 22 across the motor. A conductor 34 completes the circuit by connecting the switch to the motor 20. An opposite side of the motor is connected to the positive battery terminal. In the present invention, a transmission is energized by the power source and includes a pinion gear 40 Figure 3 operatively associated with the output shaft 41 Figure 14 of the motor 20. The pinion gear 40 drives a crown or face gear 42 Figures 3 and 4 which is rotatably mounted within the handle portion 6 such that when the motor 20 is energized, rotation of the pinion 40 causes rotation of the face gear 42 about a vertical axis which is generally normal to the longitudinal central axis of the housing 4. As best illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, a crank arm or rod 44 is pivotly connected to a rack drive shaft 46 by means of a swivel member 48. By this arrangement, the drive train assembly, designated generally at 50, Figures 3, 4 and 5 transmits the mechanical energy via the power transmission to the series of tufts 16 and 18 in a controlled, reciprocating manner so that the rotation of the tufts is reversed after a predetermined number of revolutions. Also, the tufts are counter rotated, that is, adjacent tufts rotate in opposite directions relative to one another, as illustrated by the arrows in Figure 5. More specifically, the rotational movement of the crown or face gear 42 is transferred into linear reciprocating motion via the drive train assembly 50 Figure 5 for counter rotating the tufts 16 and 18 about their vertical axes. For this purpose, one end of the crank arm 44 is operatively connected to one end of the face gear 42 which connection is radially displaced from the central axis of the face gear and the rack drive shaft 46. This connection, via the swivel 48, acts such that the drive shaft 46 will be caused to move in linearly reciprocating cycles dotted line along its longitudinal axis when the motor unit 20 Figure 4 is energized. This reciprocating motion results from the action of the crank arm 44 moving in a circular path defined by movement of the face gear 42. The length of stroke defined in reciprocating movement of the rack drive shaft 46 is a function of the radial distance between the center of the face gear 42 and the central point of attachment of the crank arm 44 to the face gear, as disclosed in aforementioned U.S. Patent No. 4,156,620. Preferably, this stroke, for periodontal applications, is approximately 0.7 inches 1,79cm . Now in accordance with an important aspect of the present invention, the drive train assembly 50 includes an elongated rack member 52 which may be made integral with the rack drive shaft 46 for reciprocal movement between top 54 and bottom 56 bearing members Figure 5 being reversed from Figure 4 for purpose of clarity which are preferably made from a polymeric material having good strength and wear characteristics. As best seen in Figures 3, 4, 18 and 19 the rack member 52 extends through a cavity, as at 58, defined between the confronting faces of the bearing members 54 and 56. An access opening, as at 60, may be provided on the rearward end between the bearing members 54, 56 to slidably receive the rack member 52. The opposite ends of the bearing member provide an access opening, as at 62, to enable the terminal end of the rack member 52 to extend slightly beyond the bearing members 54 and 56 during the maximum stroke thereof, as desired. The bearing members 54 and 56 may be detachably connected together by means of integral pins 61 received in pin holes 63. The rack member 52 is of an elongated, unitary construction, including a plurality of oppositely disposed and laterally spaced rack teeth 64, which are disposed in the same generally horizontal plane. The rack member 52 includes integral, cam like guide portions 66 which extend laterally outward therefrom and generally normal to the rack teeth 64. These guide portions 66 have inclined surfaces, as at 68, at each of the forward ends Figure 5 so as to facilitate insertion into and out of the access opening 60 Figures 3 and 4 provided between said bearing members 54 and 56. As best illustrated in Figure 3, the rearward end of the rack member 52 has inclined shoulders, as at 70, which provide a stop for limiting forward axial reciprocal movement of said rack member, as desired. Now in accordance with the invention, the rack member 52 engages an oppositely disposed pair of tuft holder drive members 72 and 74 which, in turn, drive a series of tuft holder driven gear members generally designated at 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88 and 90 respectively. The tuft holder drive gear members 72 and 74 are of identical construction and best illustrated in Figures 6, 7 and 8. As shown, each tuft holder drive member, as at 72, includes an elongated cylindrical body 92 having an integral, solid journal end portion 94 adapted to be journaled within a bearing opening 71 Figures 23 and 26 provided in the top bearing member 54, and an integral receptacle like portion 96 defining a cup like recess for slidably receiving in press fit relation therein, the tufts 16, 18. Disposed generally intermediate the end portions 94 and 96 is an integral series of drive gear teeth, as at 100, for driving engagement with the driven gears, as will be described hereinafter. Preferably, the interior of the receptacle portion 96 may be axially serrated, as at 102, to enhance the frictional engagement for retaining the respective tufts therein. As best illustrated in Figures 3, 13, 23 and 26, the bearing members 54, 56 provide mating halves which define a cavity, as at 55, therebetween. This cavity houses the drive train 50 and slidably receives there through the rack member 52. The bearing members 54, 56 together define at one end a generally inverted T shaped recessed portion 60 adapted to slidably receive there though the corresponding guide portions 66 on the rack member 52. The top bearing member 54 has a recessed slot and groove extending axially therethrough, as at 57 and 59, which provide cam like track for the upper guide portions 66 on the rack member 52. By this arrangement the rack member 52 is guided into and through the recessed slot 57 in the cavity 55 between the bearing members so as to maintain alignment and registration with the respective drive and driven gears of the gear train. Also, it will be seen that the upper or top bearing member 54 Figures 3 and 13 has an enlarged boss portion 57 to receive the approximate upper one half of the tuft holder drive gears 72 and 74, as will hereinafter be described. The bearing members are preferably made from a polymeric material having good strength and wear characteristics. These members may be detachably connected together via integral pins 61 and pin hole openings 63 Figures 24, 25 26 and 27 to provide an efficient snap action between the component parts for ready assembly or disassembly for inspection, cleaning and or removal of the drive train components. The respective tuft holder driven gear members, as at 76, are also of an identical construction and generally similar to the tuft holder drive gear members. These each include a body having an integral journaled portion 106, and an integral receptacle portion 108 defining a cup like recess opening 110 having axial serrations 112 therein, as aforesaid. In this case, however, the driven gear members have integral driven gear teeth, as at 114, which are fore shortened in axial width relative to the corresponding axial width of the drive gear teeth 100 of the drive gear members. Preferably, the axial width e.g. 0.120 inches 0.305cm of the gear teeth 100 on the drive gear members is approximately twice the corresponding axial width e.g. 0.050 inches 0.127cm of the gear teeth 114 on the driven gear members. By this construction and arrangement, the teeth 64 of the rack member 52 engage the approximate top one half portion of the drive teeth 100 on the drive gear members 72 and 74 and hence, do not engage the downstream driven gear members 76 90. The approximate lower one half portion of the drive gears 100 of the drive gear members 72 and 74 then substantially simultaneously mesh with the first adjacent pair 76 and 78 of the driven gear members which then, in turn, drive, in piggy back relation, the next successive driven gear members 80 90. Accordingly, by this arrangement it will be seen that substantially all the torque load forces imparted by reciprocal movement of the rack member 52 are borne only the gear teeth 100 on the drive gear members 72 and 74 which constitute, in effect, the working end of the drive train assembly. Also, this drive train construction allows relative rotation of the downstream, piggy back driven gears as the train need only be driven by one or more drive gears merely with the rack member 52. In the invention, it is preferred that the axial width of the gear teeth 100 on the drive gear members 72 and 74 be approximately twice the axial width of the driven teeth or such that the axial width of the driven gear teeth extends to approximately the mid point Figure 13 of the drive teeth 100 on the driven gear members 72 and 74. Also, it is preferred that the transverse width of the rack teeth 64 be the same e.g. 0.050 inches 0.127cm the corresponding axial width of the driven gear teeth 114 but less than the corresponding axial length of the drive gear teeth 100 as best illustrated in Figure 19. In a preferred form of the invention, there are hereinafter set forth the typical mechanical characteristics for the drive gears, driven gears, and drive rack Because of the controlled reciprocating linear movement of the drive rack member 52, each tuft 16 or 18 is rotated in a controlled reciprocating manner for a predetermined cycle. Reciprocating movement in one direction of one and one half times the base circumference of each tuft is chosen in the preferred embodiment. By this arrangement, each tuft is rotated first one and one half revolutions in one direction and then approximately one and one half revolutions in the opposite direction. It is to be understood, however, that the amount of reciprocating rotation may vary in accordance with the diameter of the filaments in each tuft, the length and diameter of each tuft, etc., as desired. The desirable speed for operation of the reciprocating rack 52 for periodontal applications, for example, may be approximately 1,500 cycles per minute with one and one half revolutions in each direction per cycle. In such case, the tufts rotate at approximately 4,500 effective revolutions per minute. As best illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 12, the tufts 16 and 18 may be alternately arranged into staggered rows of long and short tufts. In a preferred form, the long tufts 16 in each row are indented or positioned closer to the longitudinal axis of the brush head portion 8 than the short tufts 18 in each row. Both the short and long tufts have tapered upper surfaces, defined by the tips of the filaments of each tuft. The tapered configuration of the tufts facilitates penetration into recessed cavities or interproximal crevices, in the case of dental applications. Each tuft is comprised of a plurality of filaments having a predetermined diameter and physical characteristics, so that the desired cleaning action will be realized with the rotational tuft movement of the present invention. For example, each tuft may have a diameter of approximately 0.090 inches and may contain hundreds of filaments, as desired. As best seen in Figure 12, the long and short tufts 16 and 18 are made from a polymeric material, such as nylon fused together at one end, as at 17 and 19, to provide a generally solid, mass like base portion. This portion may be press fit, for example, into the respective receptacle portions, as at 96 and 108, of the respective drive and driven gear tuft holder members 72 90 to facilitate insertion and registration of the tufts within the corresponding tuft holder receptacle. Now in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there is provided the pneumatic system for cleansing via a pumping action residue materials, such as tooth paste or the like, from the brush head portion 12 and particularly from the drive train 50. In this embodiment, the system includes a bearing drive member 120 which is preferably made from a polymeric material and which is fixably attached to the interior of the housing 4, as best illustrated in Figures 3, 4 and 5. This bearing member 120, receives therethrough the drive rack member 52 and provides a bearing support therefor. In the embodiment illustrated in Figure 5, the bearing member 120 is provided with a recessed cavity, as at 122, which fixably mounts a flexible flapper valve member 124. The valve member is preferably made from a polymeric material, such as MYLAR, a trademark material of the DuPont Company. The flapper valve 124 is fixably attached to the bearing member 120 by means of a suitable fastener, as at 123, and has an aperture, as at 126, to enable ingress and egress of pneumatic pressure e.g. air therethrough. Accordingly, upon the rearward stroke of the rack drive shaft 46 and hence, the rack member 52, the flapper valve member 124 opens so as to draw air into the interior of the housing, as at 128, of the brush head portion 8. Upon reverse movement of the drive rack shaft 46 the valve 124 closes. This provides a pumping action upon forward movement of the rack member 52 which acts to force air out of the cavities 58 and 128 through suitable openings provided through and or around the tufts 16 and 18 a clearance space, as at 125 Figure 18 , between the tuft holders and the confronting surface of the lower bearing member 56, as illustrated by the arrows in Figure 13. This pumping action provides a positive pressure in the drive train cavity 58 so that any residue material, such as tooth paste or the like, is flushed out after normal usage thereof. In another embodiment, and best illustrated in Figures 3, 4, 18, and 19, the bearing member 120 is again fixably mounted interiorly of the housing 4 and in this form does not include the flexible flapper valve 124. Here a flexible seal member 130 having a base like wiper portion 131 and an integral forward extending tapered conical portion 132 is fixably retained in the housing 4 against an integral elongated, hollow hub portion 133 of the bearing member 120. In this case, the base like wiper portion 131 is frictionally retained against the confronting interior surface of the housing 4, as at 135, such that the drive shaft 46 is slidably passed through a passageway, as at 137, provided in the base 131 and conical portions 132 of the flexible seal, as seen in Figures 18 and 19. The base like wiper portion 131 provides a friction, liquid seal against the confronting surface of the hub portion 133 so as to prevent the ingress of liquid behind the drive shaft 46 into the power handle of the device. As shown in Figure 4, the bearing member 120 may have one or more apertures therein, as at 129, to prevent the formation of a vacuum behind the wiper seal 131 during reciprocal movement of the drive shaft 46. Also, in this embodiment the brush head portion 12 may be provided with outlet openings, as at 139, just forward of the wiper seal, and in the brush head portion, as at 139, to allow the ingress of a cleansing media, such as hot water or the like, therethrough. Accordingly, in this embodiment the liquid cleansing fluid may be poured into the openings 139 and moved axially through the brush head portion 12 via gravity and or the pumping action of the drive shaft 46, and out through openings 141 for cleansing the drive train 50 within the brush head portion 12. Now in the invention, and as best illustrated in Figures 3, 4, 14 and 14A, a new and novel control switch assembly 14 is detachably mounted on an interior wall surface 134 of the brush head portion 8 of the housing 4. As illustrated in Figure 14, the components of the switch assembly 14 include a frame member 140 with an integral base portion 142. The frame includes an integral upper inclined support portion 141, having an aperture 143 extending therethrough and adapted to support a printed circuit board 144 thereon. This circuit board 144 contains a suitable contact switch circuit, as 146 Figure 14A , for actuation by a spring contact 148 retained by a switch body 150 via an O ring seal 152. On the under side of the support portion 141 of the frame 140 is a detent 154 retained by a spring washer 156. This, in turn, is retained by a washer 158, retained by a screw 160, which may be threaded into a threaded collar 162 made integral with the switch body 150. The switch contact 148 is slightly bowed away from the switch body 150. As the screw 160 is threaded into the collar 162, the combination of the spring washer 156 and the bowed configuration of the contact 148 bias the contact against the printed circuit board 144. Details of the print circuit board 144 are illustrated in Figures 15, 16 and 14A. The contact 148 is schematically illustrated in various positions selected by the user. In the three positions shown in Figure 16, the motor 20 has been deactivated by opening the circuit between two circuit connections 144a, 144b. Turning now to Figure 15, contact positions for energizing the motor are illustrated. The user can rotate the switch body 150 by a button 151 that engages the body 150 through the housing. The button defines a slot 151a therein to facilitate rotation of the contact 148 to the three positions shown in Figure 15. In the position shown to the right of Figure 15, the configuration of the switch 14 couples the motor 20 directly across the battery. In the two other positions shown in Figure 15, the switch 14 selectively adds one of the resistors R1, R2, into the motor circuit to reduce the motor speed. Representative values for the resistors R1, R2 are .1 and .22 ohms with the larger resistance R2 providing low speed motor operation. Details of the contact points on the printed circuit 144 are shown in Figure 14A. A detent action is provided by the detent 154 in combination with the incline support portion 141. A surface of the incline portion 141 facing the detent defines two ridges 141a, 141b shown in phantom in Figure 14. A corresponding face of the detent 154 defines a series of grooves 154a that engage a bottom ridge 141b to lock the switch contact in one of the positions shown in Figures 15 and 16. When the motor is to be switched from high to medium speed, the user rotates the button 151 causing the ridge 141b to ride up over the groove into an adjoining groove and again lock the switch in place. By slidably moving the switch body 150 in the direction illustrated by the arrow 155 in Figure 14, the motor can be turned on and off. The ridge 141a provides a detent action to the on and off motion of the switch by engaging an edge of the detent between two bosses 154b. The bosses 154b in the detent switch 154 limit rotation of the switch body so that in the event the user attempts to rotate the button 151 beyond either the high speed or low speed position, continued rotation is prevent by contact of these bosses 154b with the ridge 141a on the incline frame portion 141. The novel construction of the switch and frame allow the user to adjust the motor speed in either an off or on position. The detent and motion limiting aspects of the switch assembly insure proper switch setting and prevent unintended movement of the switch during motor operation. The use of the frame as both a support for the switch and a mounting for the motor drive train contributes to a compact construction for the cleaning device 2. Now in Figure 17 there is illustrated a charger support stand assembly 30 which includes the aforementioned female socket 28 for receipt of the male socket portion 26 of the cleaning device for purpose of recharging the batteries 22 of the power supply. As shown, the charger assembly 30 is of a generally L shaped configuration having a hollow base portion 170 and an integral upstanding, hollow back support portion 172 for detachable connection to a supporting wall or the like not shown via suitable fasteners, as at 174. The charger includes a conventional power cord 176, which may be inserted through an inlet opening 178 and wound around a bracket retainer 180 mounted within an interior cavity 182 formed in the back support 172. The base portion 170 includes a primary bobbin 184 for supporting a primary coil for energizing the secondary coil assembly 14 disposed in the handle portion 6 of the cleaning device, as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. The support stand 30 has a generally L shaped configuration which enables multiple storage and or use positions thereof. For example, the base portion 170 allows the stand to be freely mounted on a work surface, such as a counter or the like, and the back support portion 172 enables the stand to be hung, for example, on a support surface such as a wall or the like. Also, the stand is constructed and arranged such that the cleaning device can be placed in a draining mode for draining residue materials from the brush head member 9. Specifically, with the male socket portion 26 mounted in the female socket 28 of the base portion 170 of the stand and the brush head portion 12 mounted on a forward support surface of an integral head portion 185 of the stand, the housing 4 of the cleaning device 12 is inclined slightly downwardly from the rear to the front to provide constant drainage through the outlet opening 141 provided in the brush head portion 12. Now as best illustrated in Figures 20, 21 and 22, there is illustrated a new and novel filling or reloading kit, designated generally at 190, for filling or re loading the tufts filaments 16 and 18 into the respective tuft holder members of the associated drive and driven gears. As shown, the kit includes a base member 200 having a support recess 202 which is contoured to receive the confronting surface of the brush head portion 12. This base member provides a support for the brush head portion and acts to prevent sliding and or rotational movement thereof during filling or re loading of the tufts. A cap like fixture member 204 is provided which has a bottom skirt like portion 206 defined by an integral flange 208 which set over and around a corresponding cover member 208 mounted over and around the lower bearing member 54, illustrated in Figures 3 and 13. The cap member 204 includes an upper body portion 210 which has a plurality of generally symmetrically oriented , cylindrical passageways of a longer 212 and a shorter 214 construction for receiving the tufts 16 and 18 therein. The passageways are disposed in substantially parallel relationship with respect to one another and provide guides for inserting the tufts contained therein into the respective tuft holders of the associated drive and driven gear members. As illustrated, the shorter cylindrical passageways have a counter sunk portion, as at 216, to receive a correspondingly shaped integral collar member 218 formed on a manual tamper member 220. The tamper member 220 includes an elongated, cylindrical tamper element 222 for tamping the respective tufts through the cylindrical passageways and into the tuft holders, as aforesaid. In one form, the tamper element may have a generally conical recessed cavity, as at 224. to receive the corresponding tapered end of the respective tuft or may simply have a generally flat configuration, for example, in the case of tufts which are trimmed flat. It will be understood that the cap member may have any array or number of cylindrical passageways to accommodate the various size and arrangement of the tufts to be utilized in accordance with the invention for a particular cleaning application. As illustrated, a cap member may include an integral upstanding guide portion 226 which includes another cylindrical passageway 228 which extends parallel to the aforementioned passageways 212 and 214 for insertion and dispensing another single tuft therefrom. This guide portion also provides a handle for manually manipulating the cap member thereby to orient the axial passageways relative to the corresponding tuft holder receptacles. For example, in use, the guide portion 226 can be used as a hand le for registering the other cylindrical portions, or the body 210 defining such cylindrical portions can be used as a handle for registering the single guide portion when it is desired to replace, for example, only one of the tufts relative to the desired tuft array. Accordingly, this kit provides upper and lower base and cap members which may be effectively utilized, in combination, with the cleaning device for filling or reloading tufts, of any configuration, orientation or size, into the associated tuft holders. While a particular embodiment of the invention has been shown and described in reference to a periodontal cleaning device, it is to be understood that the principles involved with respect to the construction and function of such device can be effectively utilized in other cleaning, polishing, scrubbing or like applications where relatively small inaccessible parts having curved and or flat surfaces are to be cleaned.
