# Microbial expression of insulin like growth factor.

## Abstract
Disclosed is the manufacture of DNA sequences com prising structural genes coding for 1 a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence and properties of insulin like growth factor I for 2 a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence and properties of insulin like growth factor II and for 3 polypeptide analogs of insulin like growth factor I and insulin like growth factor II which differ from the naturally occurring forms in terms of the identity and or location of one or more amino acids, e.g., Thr⁵⁹ IGF I and Arg⁵⁴Arg⁵⁵ IGF II.
