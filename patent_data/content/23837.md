# Fuel saver for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
Devices are shown and described for attachment to an engine s intake manifold 22 to regulate its vacuum for fuel economy. The device maintains smooth engine operation by employing multiple valves, each of which provides a supple mental flow of air to the intake manifold during a particular en gine mode. Thus, during an idle mode one individually settable valve 44 is operative to supply additional air to the intake ma nifold to maintain its vacuum at a precisely selected level refer enced to an engine idle mode while during deceleration, when a high volume of air is needed, a supplemental flow of air is ad mitted from another valve 48 which opens at a higher vacuum level from the first valve. A third valve 46 is employed to admit supplemental air during acceleration when the other two valves are closed for an improved fuel to air mixture. Several embodiments are shown.
