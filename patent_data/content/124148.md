## Description
A manual sewing thimble provided with needle threading deviceThe invention relates to a manual sewing thimble having attached thereto a needle threading device.To thread a needle is an operation which can be accomplished with easiness and rapidity only by particularly skilled people and which, on the contrary, is of particular difficulty for unskilled people and or for the persons having sight troubles.Are not known, up todate, small needle threading devices making part of a thimble so as to allow the operator to thread the needle and also to allow the same operator to carry it in the purse for the necessity of immediate swings. The invention as claimed is intended to provide a manual sewing thimble having associated thereto a needle threading device with can be used without difficulty at all by the interested persons also if having sight troubles and which has such reduced dimensions to be easily carried in a purseAccording to the invention, the manual sewing thimble is of the type comprising a hollow frusto conical body provided with an edge and is characterised in that to said thimble there is associated a device for threading a thread yarn into the eye of the sewing needle.Said device comprises a ring carrying on its outer surface a circumferential groove having on its center line a projecting laminate element lying with its major axis parallel to the major axis of said circumferential groove, one side edge of said laminate element is shaped to form a hook and the opposite side edge of the same laminate element has a narrow slot, said hook and slot projecting beyond said circumferential groove.One way for carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings which illustrate only one specific embodiment and the operation thereof.In the drawings Figure 1 is a perspective view showing the thimble and the associated needle threading device,Figure 2 is an enlarged perspective view of the needle threading device, andFigures 3 5 show schematically the needle threading operationThe figures show a manual sewing thimble, generally denoted at 1, comprising a hollow frusto conical body 2 having on the outer surface a plurality of conventional dottings 3.Near the edge 4 of the body 2 there is provided a circular seat 5 forming the housing for a ring 6 carrying on i on its outer surface a circumferential groove 7 having two opposed substantially vertical shoulders 8 and two opposed substantially inclined end shoulders 9 and 9 .The width of the groove 7 is larger than the maximum size of an eye 10 of a conventional manual sewing needle 11.A laminate element 12 projects from the center line of the groove 7 and said element 12 has its major axis. arranged parallel to the major axis of the groove 7. The edge 13 of element 12 facing the shoulder 9 is shaped to form an ample hook 14 while the opposite edge 15 is inclined relative to the vertical in the same direction of the shoulder 9 and is provided with a narrow slot 16, both the hook 14 and the slot 16 project beyond the circumferential groove 7. The upper edge portion of the laminate element 12 is shaped as an arc of circle and the section and height of the same laminate element 12 are smaller than the width and length of said eye 10, respectively.A metal arrow shaped element F is positioned outwardly of the circumferential groove 7 and parallel to the major axis thereof so as to indicate the direction in which the needle 11 has to be positioned for a proper use of the needle threading device. In the operation, the thimble 1 is conventionally carried by an operator s finger and for threading the needle 11 it will be sufficient to cause the eye 10 to slide in the direction of arrow F along the groove 7 until said eye is engaged by the hook 14. On releasing the needle 11 it will dispose itself along the bottom of the groove 7, tanentially to the body 2 and projecting out of the groove 7 in direction of the shoulder 9 . A length of sewing thread yarn 18 is retained at one end while sliding by the other end along the needle 11 until it engages the slot 16. The needle 11 is then rotated arrow G for its disengagement arrow G fromvelement 12 and, doing so, the yarn 18 is automatically threaded into the eye 10.
