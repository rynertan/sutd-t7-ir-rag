# Electro pneumatic control for a vehicle fluid pressure braking system.

## Abstract
An electro pneumatic control system 10 for a vehicle fluid pressure braking system controls communication to the trailer supply line 30 and to the vehicle spring applied, fluid pressure released parking brakes 78 . Relays 66, 92 are controlled by manually actuated switches 42, 58 to actuate solenoid valves 74, 84 which control communica tion to the supply line 30 and to the parking brakes 78 . Actuation of the solenoid valves 74, 84 is maintained by the relays 66, 92 in response to pressure actuated switches 76, 88 which are responsive to the pressure levels in the supply line 30 and in the parking brake 78 .
