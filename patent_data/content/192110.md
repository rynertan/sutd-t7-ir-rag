## Description
AIR OUTLET UNIT FOR AIR CONDITIONING OR VENTILATIONSYSTEMS IN MOTOR VEHICLES The present invention relates to an air outlet unit for air conditioning or ventilation systems in motor vehicles. As is known, air dispensing outlets or ventilation devices are equipped with a butterfly valve for intercepting the airflow and with a double array of vanes for directing the flow in the horizontal and vertical planes. Each of these members is actuated through a corresponding control generally comprising a handwheel slightly protruding from the outlet bezel.Operating three separate controls may be sometimes inconvenient, and not being instinctive, may distract the driver. Furthermore, the kinematic transmissions interposed between each control and the corresponding driven member, aggravate space requirements and appreciably complicate the outlet fitting 5 construction, thus being disadvantageous regarding manufacturing costs and operating reliability. The present invention is directed essentially to obviate such shortcomings, and has the important object of providing an air outlet unit for air conditioning or ventilation systems in motor vehicles equipped with a simplified and instinctively operable control, that is one which requires only minimal attention of the vehicle s driver, the device having at the same time a relatively simple construction and being reliable in operation. To achieve these important objects, as well as other objects to become apparent hereinafter, the present invention has for its subject an air outlet unit for air conditioning or ventilation systems in motor vehicles including a butterfly valve and a double array of crossing horizontal and vertical vanes respectively for intercepting and directing the airflow, characterised in that it comprises a single oscillable and translatable key for selectively controlling said double arrayed vanes and shutter valve and means for transferring the key movements selectively to said vanes and valve. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the key is a rockable key secured, for oscillation about two orthogonal axes, on the end of a spring loaded plunger rod the oscillation of the key about either axis being utilised to move a corresponding vane array, and the linear movement of the plunger rod being used to open or close the shutter valve. Preferably, the key movements are transmitted to the valve and vanes through corresponding flexible sleeved wire cables of the Bowden kind, and the valve control is of the push push kind using a rocker arm with an end pin cooperating with a face cam formed with a cardioid shaped retaining projection. According to another aspect of the invention, the key movements are transmitted to said valve and vanes by means of kinematic transmissions, such as lever systems, and according to a further aspect of the invention, the transmission is a composite one, including levers or the like e.g. to control the shutter salve and part cable operated. Further features and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description, with reference to the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a longitudinal mid section of an air outlet unit with a single airflow orienting and intercepting key according to this invention Figure 2 is a cut away perspective view showing diagrammatically the flow orienting and intercepting members and their control procedure by means of said single key in that view the shutter valve being shown in the closed position Figure 3 is a perspective detail view of Figure 2 showing the shutter valve in its open position Figure 4 is a longitudinal sectional view similar to Figure 1, showing another aspect of the outlet unit according to the invention Figure 5 is a detail sectional view taken along the line V V of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a detail sectional view taken along the line VI VI of Figure 4 Figure 7 is a detail sectional view taken along the line VII VII of Figure 4 Figure 8 is a longitudinal sectional view of an outlet unit according to a further aspect of the invention Figure 9 is a sectional view taken along the lineIX IX of Figure 8 and Figure 10 is a sectional view taken along the line X X of Figure 8. With reference initially to Figures 1 to 3, the reference numeral 10 generally denotes the dispensing air outlet unit or fitting of this invention which comprises an outer case 11 advantageously of a polymeric material provided with a bezel carrying a grid diffuser 12 and a seat 13 underlying the grid wherein a rockable or tiltable key 14 is housed. The key is secured to the end of a plunger rod 15 for oscillation about two axes a b orthogonal to each other and laid the one parallel to the vertical direction and th other parallel to the horizontal direction. The attachment of the key 14 to the rod 15 is of the universal or cardan type and if said rod and key are of a polymeric material, it is advantageously composed of at least one peduncle or narrowed portion of said common material such that the oscillable connection between the rod and key is formed on moulding. The plunger rod 15 is axially movable against the action of a spring 16 and guided with a larger diameter portion 15A thereof in a cylindrical bush 17 of the bezel and with a smaller diameter portion 15B thereof in the hole 18a in a wall 18 of the case 11. The two rod portions are separated by a plate 19 rigidly associated or formed integrally with the rod itself and hence subjectable to the axial displacement of the rod produced by a normal stress applied to actuate the key 14. With the plate 19 there are rigidly associated the ends 20 21 of first and second sleeves of corresponding flexible cables 22 23 of the Bowden wire type. One end of the cable 22 is articulated to an eye 22a of the key 14 vertically offoentered in relation to the axis of the rod 15 one end of the cable 23 is articulated to a corresponding eye 23a of the key 14 horizontally offcentered in relation to said axis of the rod 15. The other end of the cable 22 is articulated to an eye 22b carried on the first vane of an array of horizontal vanes 30 supported oscillably within the case 11 and being interconnected by a rod 31 the second end 24 of the cable 22 sleeve reacting against a fixed wall 25 rigidly associated with the case 11. Likewise the other end of the cable 23 is articulated to an eye 23b carried on the first vane of an array of vertical vanes 32 also supported oscillably within the case 11 and interconnected by a conventional rod not shown the second end 26 of the cable 23 sleeve being reacted by a fixed wall 27 of the case 11. The plate 19 of the rod 15 carries in turn an eye 33 whereto the end of a flexible cable 34 is articulated the sleeve 34a whereof has an end 35 adapted to react against the wall 18 of the case 11. The other end of the cable 34 is articulated to a control lever system 36 for the shutter valve 37 formed of an oscillable butterfly contained in a manifold 38 of the case 11 to which the conventional air supply hose not shown connects. A rigid bracket 39, rigidly associated with the manifold 38, forms the reaction element for the second end of the cable 34 sleeve 34a.The lever system 36 is composed of a first arm 40 keyed on the pin 41 of the valve 37 and subjected to the action of spring means such as a hairpin spring 42 tending to hold or bias the valve in the closed position and a second arm 43 mounted idly rotatable on said pin 41 the arm 43 being subjectable to the action of the cable 34. The first arm 40 carries a protruding wing 44 adapted to be engaged positively by the second arm 43 to entrain the first arm 40 as said second arm is urged by the cable 34 to turn in the direction which corresponds to the valve 37 being open counterclockwise with reference to Figure 2 . As clearly shown in Figure 2, the arm 40 carries an end pin 45 which engages in a track 46 of a face cam which bifurcates upwardly into two track portions 46A46B, respectively for the upward and downward movements of the pin 45. The two track portions are separated by a cardioid shaped projection wherein a notch 47 is formed which receives the pin 45 for holding the arm 40 in the valve 37 opening position. Upwardly of the notch 47, there is provided a tip 48 adapted to deflect the pin in the downward branch 46B upon said pin being urged to leave the notch 47.The valve control mechanism is thus actuated to open and close by a dual depression of the key 14 and is of the so called push push or double thrust type drive. When the arm 40 is held in the valve opening position by the pin 45 engaging with the notch 47, the arm 43 is returned to the original position Figure 3 by the spring 16 acting on the key rod 15. From the foregoing description, it may be appreciated that the oscillation of the tilting key 14 about the horizontal axis b will cause the cable 22 to slide inside its respective sleeve and produoe a corresponding angular displacement of the horizontal vane array 30 which direct the flow in the vertical plane that displacement applying no tension on the cable 23 the articulation point of which is located at said horizontal axis of the key 14. Similarly the oscillation of the key about the vertical axis a brings about the corresponding angular movement of the vertical vane array 32 which direct the flow in the horizontal plane without placing the cable 22 under stress because of the fact that the articulation point thereof lies on said vertical axis a of said key 14. It may also be appreciated that the axial translation of the key 14 to control the valve 37 does not exert stress on the small cables 22 23 since the plate 19, being rigidly associated with the rod 15, moves with the key itself. To meet particular space requirements the sleeves of the flexible cables may be at least partially replaced by corresponding canalisations moulded in the outer case 11 of the outlet fitting 10. In the variation of Figures 4 to 7, where like or corresponding parts are indicated by the same reference numerals, the movements of the key 14 are transferred to the two vane arrays 30 32 and the valve 37 by means of kinematic transmission means of the lever system type. For that purpose the plate 19 carries an integral rib 50 placed edgewise and extending substantially orthogonal to the plate itself. The rib 50 carries a first lever system comprising a first rocker arm 51 to one end of which there is articulated a first small rigid rod 52 articulated, with the opposed end, to a point on the key 14 vertically offcentered with respect to the axis of the rod 15. To the other end of the rocker arm there is journalled the end of a small connnecting rod 53 the other end of which is journalled to the first vane of the horizontal array 30. The rib 50 moves with the plate 19 as the key 14 is translated and the small connecting rod 53, turning about the respective articulation points, leaves the position of the vanes 30 unchanged which, vice versa as clearly shown inFigure 4, will oscillate upon corresponding oscillations of the key 14 about the horizontal axis extending through the centre of the articulation swivel interposed to said key and rod 15. On the end of the rib 50 there is provided a tube 54 carrying a pin 55 on which there articulates a second lever system 56 for transferring the movements of the key 14 to the vertical vanes 32.That second lever system is in turn composed Figure 5 of a second rocker arm 57 to one end of which there is articulated the end of a second small rigid rod 58 articulated, with the opposed end, to a point of the key 14 horizontally offcentered in relation to the axis of the rod 15. On the other end of the rocker arm 57 there is journalled the end of a second small connecting rod 59, the other end of which is journalled on the first vane of the vertical array 32. The operation of this second lever system is identical to what has been described previously as the key 14 is caused to oscillate about the vertical axis. To control the valve 37, which in that version is oscillable about a vertical axis defined by vertical pins 60 61, a third lever system is employed which is operated by the end of the rod 15. For this purpose, the end of the rod 15 is provided with an articulation or gudgeon pin 62 which engages in the slot of a right angle crank and slot link 63 Figure 6 rigidly associated with a vertical pin 64. The latter also carries, at a higher elevation than the right angle crank and slot link 63, a crank lever 65 which drives, through a small connecting rod 66, a second crank lever 67 fast with the valve pin 60.The crank and slot link 63 allows for the unloaded return of the rod 15 when, after an opening thrust has been exerted, the valve 37 stays in that position being held back by a push push retaining ram device 68 of the type detailedly described in the prior European patent application N.84108157.3 filed on tilth July 1984 by this sameApplicant. The device 68 has the cylindrical body 69 articulated to a yoke 70 of the pin 64 and the end of the stem 71 engaged in a bracket 72 rigid with the body of the outlet fitting. The variation of Figures 8 to 10 relates to a composite solution wherein the valve 37 is controlled by a first kinematic transmission and the double array of horizontal 30 and vertical 32 vanes are controlled by means of corresponding flexible sleeve cables 22 and 23 articulated to the key 14 at points vertically and horizontally offcentered in relation to the axis of the rod 14. The drive for the valve 37 comprises here a crank lever 80 rigid with the valve pin, engaged positively, by mere thrust contact, by the end of the plunger rod 15. The crank lever 80 is biased by a coil spring 81 tending to hold the valve 37 in the closed position and carries, at the remote end from that on which the rod 15 acts, a pin 45 engaging in a face cam 46 with a cardioid shaped projection forming a double thrust retention identical to what has been described in relation to the embodiment of Figures 1 to 3. Of course, within the principle of the invention, the construction details and embodiments may be varied, with respect to what has been described and illustrated by way of non limitative example, without departing from the scope of the invention. In particular, the described transmissions, and especially the valve control drive transmission, may be power assisted if required by a special demand for a smooth operation of the key 14. Thus, it will be appreciated that the invention realizes the proposed objects by providing An air outlet unit for air conditioning or ventilation systems in motor vehicles, characterised in that said small plate rigid with the rod carries an eye for the articulation of the shutter valve control cable and in that the other end of the cable acts on a lever system rigidly associated with the valve pivot pin An air outlet unit, characterised in that said first arm of the lever system for operating the shutter valve carries an end pin which engages with a face cam with an upward run and a downward run of the pin being separated by a retaining projection of cardioid like shape forming a double thrust drive An air outlet unit, characterised in that said cardioid shaped projection is provided with a notch intended for receiving the pin of the first arm to retain the arm itself in the shutter valve open position and in that, upwardly of the notch, a tip is provided which is adapted to deflect the pin in the downward run of the face cam on said pin being urged to leave the notch An air outlet unit, characterised in that the tilting key is secured to the plunger rod by means of a cardan type of swivel joint An air outlet unit, characterised in that said key and rod are of unitary construction of a polymeric material and connected by at least one peduncle forming said swivel joint An air outlet unit, characterised in that the movements of the tilting and translatable key are transferred to said valve and vanes by kinematic transmission means acting selectively on the respective driven members.
