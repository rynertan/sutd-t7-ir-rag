## Description
FILTER FOR HEMODIALYSIS AND OR HEMOFILTRATION ANI oR PLASMAPHERESI S This invention relates to a filter for hemodialysis and or hemofiltration and or plasmapheresis. Known in the fields of plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and hemodialysis,are blood filters which may be classed according to two general types a first type embodied by filters which comprise a plurality of fluted superimposed plates having the flutes set in mutual alignment, thus forming a plurality of small mutually parallel channels, between which are interposed two filtering membranes the assembly is placed into a respective container having two inlet ports and two outlet ports, through which the dialytic liquid is caused to flow the blood to be purified is caused to flow between the two filtering membranes, causing the affected membrane portion to adhere against the walls of each corresponding flute. The second filter type is embodied by a vertical cylindrical body of sort which contains a longitudinally laid bundle of hollow fibers forming the filtering body proper, blood, for example, to be dialyzed being caused to flow therethrough an interspace of sort is provided around said bundle, the dialytic liquid flows through said interspace, and also flows between fibers in said bundle to electrolytically remove impurities left on them by blood flowing past. Such filter types are completed by upper and lower manifolds, respectively for blood admission and discharge, and two side ports, one located close to dialytic liquid inlet bottom and outlet top, respect ively. The pore size of the membranes in the former case, and additionally the fiber cavity size in the latter, are such as to prevent, owing to the density of blood, its exiting the intended path, with consequent mixing with the dialytic liquid. Such prior filters have, however, some deficiencies that make their use expensive as well as laborious. There occurs primarily, during the treatment of a patient s blood, a significant decrease in the filtering capacity, due essentially to impurity fibrin build ups on either the hollow fibers or membranes, with attendant partial occlusion of the pores formed in both of them furthermore, owing to said membranes and fibers being sold as specimens having single wall thickness dimensions of the capillaries as well as different useful surfaces of the filtering body, where a patient is to be subjected to blood purifying treatment using, according to the attending physician judgement, several filter types, replacement of the latter becomes necessary each time, which involves the availability of stocks of different filter types. It is the technical aim of this invention to obviate the aforementioned prior shortcomings by providing a filter for hemodialysis and or hemofiltration and or plasmapheresis which can simultaneously make available filtering units having varying capillary useful surface and thickness characteristics, and above all, can retain its filterS ing capacity almost unaltered. This and other objects are achieved by a filter for hemodialysis and or hemofiltration and or plasmapheresis, characterized in that it comprises a body enclosing a plurality of longitudinally laid hollow filtering fiber bundles, the ends whereof are captive in sealing means adapted to rotate them simultaneously about their axes, said body being provided at the top and bottom with first blood inlet, respectively outlet, ports equipped with members for fitting the filter to a line, as well as second inlet and outlet ports for the dialytic or purifier liquid located close to said top and bottom ends, the top one being also provided with a device for selecting the number of usable fiber bundles and the bottom one being provided with a means of connection to a gear motor unit adapted, with the interposition of respective drives, to cause all said bundles to revolve about the axis of said enclosing body. Further features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of a preferred, but not exclusive, embodiment of a filter for hemodialysis and or hemofiltration and or plasmapheresis, as illustrated by way of example and not of limitation in the accompanying drawings, where Figure 1 is a schematical cross section view of the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged scale view of a section of the upper portion of the invention. Sore detailedly, generally indicated at t is a filter for hemodialysis and or hemofiltration and or plasmapheresis which comprises a body 2 enclosing a plurality of bundles 3 of hollow filtering fibers the ends whereof are captive, in a sealed fashion by means of gaskets 3a, in respective hollow end fittings 4 set rotatable axially in a cavity formed in corresponding small blood manifold blocks 5. Rigid and coaxial with the end fittings 4 are pinions 6 which mesh with respective toothings 7 formed on the inside periphery of the enclosing body 2 which also has, at the top and bottom thereof, first blood inlet and outlet ports, 8a and 8b,respectively, which are provided with members 9 and 10 for fitting the filter 1 to a line. Also provided are second dialytic or purifier liquid inlet and outlet ports,10a, 10b which are located, respectively, close to the bottom and to the top of said body 2. The members 9 and 10 comprise mouths 11 wherethrough respective caps 13 and 14 fast with said line can be inserted sealingly by means of gaskets ila and with connections 12 of the so called bayonet type. Said enclosing body 2 is preferably subdivided into two portions 2a, 2b which can be joined together by utilization of suitable Jointing means 15. The upper portion 2a is provided, substantially at the top, with a device 16 for selecting the number of usable bundles 3, while the lower portion 2b is provided with a means 17 of connection to a gear motor unit adapted to cause, through the intermediary of respective drives 18, all the bundles 3 to revolve about the axis of said enclosing body 2. The cited means 17 which causes the bundles 3 to perform a revolving motion, comprises a set of mutually parallel and concentrical plates 19 wherewith the manifold blocks 4 are rigid, and which are connected axially to the cited devices 18 of the plates 19, at least one is linked to the connection means 17 to a gear motor unit. The invention operates as follows it is connected to a line transporting a patient s blood to be purified by means of the members 9 and 10. The cited blood is passed through the top port 8a, small manifold blocks 4, and hollow fiber bundles 3 forming the filtering body, to reach the outlet port 8b.Along said path , there is introduced, in counterflow relationship with the path followed by the blood, through the port 10a, the dialytic or purifier liquid, which after sweeping the bundles 3 and removing, generally electrolytically, the impurities deposited in the hollow fibers by said blood passed therethrough, flows towards the outlet port lOb. During that process, the hollow fiber bundles 3, in order to improve the exchange between the blood and dialytic liquid and avoid losses of filtering capacity, are all driven in a revolving motion around the axis of the filter 1 by connecting the means 17 to a gear motor unit which rotates the plates 19 further, and consequently, the end fittings 5 being provided with respective pinions 6 which mesh with the respective peripheral toothings 7 formed inside the body 2, the bundles 3 are also driven rotatively each about its own axis in the opposite direction to that of the revolving motion. It should be noted that the filtering surface and porosity characteristics of the hollow fibers may vary between bundles, and that a device 16, located close to the top of the filter 1 is provided which can select the number of bundles to be used this selection is preset by the operator according to the patients build, and hence, to the amount of blood to be dialyzed or purified. It has been found in practice that the device heretofore described achieves its obJects. The invention as disclosed is susceptible to many modifications and changes without departing from the purview of the inventive idea thus, as an example, both the shape of the enclosing body and number of the hollow fiber bundles, as well as their arrangement inside said body, may be changed without adversely affecting the invention operation. All of the details, moreover, may be replaced with other technically equivalent elements. In practice, any materials or dimensions may be any selected and used, contingent on requirements, without by so doing departing from the protection scope of the appended claims.
