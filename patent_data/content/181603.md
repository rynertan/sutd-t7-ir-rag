# A cross linked resin, a process for producing the same, and a resin composition including the same.

## Abstract
A cross linked resin produced by the reaction of a bis 2 oxazoline compound with a dicarboxylic acid anhydride, and optionally also with at least one selected from the group consisting of a dicarboxylic acid, a hydroxy carboxylic acid, a diol and water, in the presence of at least one catalyst selected from the group consisting of an organic phosphorous acid ester, an organic phosphonous acid ester and an inorganic salt at an elevated temperature. The cross linked resin has a high mecahnical strength and a high resistance to organic solvents. The resin composition comprising the cross linked resin and reinforcements and or fillers combined therewith has outstanding heat resistance and mechanical properties.
