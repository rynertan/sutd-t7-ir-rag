# An oriented Plastics preform for making an open mouth container.

## Abstract
A preformed plastic structure 20 for making open mouth plastic containers is disclosed. The structure is an oriented preform having a base defined by an inner circu lar portion 27 and an outer circular portion 28 situated parallel to the inner circular portion 27 and spaced there from. The radius of the outer circular portion 28 is larger than the radius of the inner circular portion 27 . The preform is further provided with an outwardly extending annular member 29 integral with the base and tapering therefrom, the member 29 forming an angle A of be tween about 2 to about 30 from the base, and a flange 30 integral with the annular member 29 and extending radially outwardly and having a cross section configu ration of substantially the rim of the finished container. The preform 20 is well suited for forming multilayered containers.
