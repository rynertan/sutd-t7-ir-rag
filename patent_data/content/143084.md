# ILLUMINATING MIXTURE FOR ILLUMINATING CANISTERS INTENDED TO BE INSERTED IN ARTILLERY PROJECTILES

## Abstract
The illuminating mixture for illuminating canisters in tended to be inserted in an artillery projectile comprises an expander of the type of the blowing agents used in the technology of plastics. In this way it is prevented that the ashes accumulate and become compact during the combus tion of the illuminating mixture and thus the ejection of the ashes from the canister is facilitated.
