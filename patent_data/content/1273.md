# Vehicle weighing system.

## Abstract
A transducer for measuring the load of a vehicle employing an equalizing beam suspension. In an equalizing beam suspension a pair of tandem wheels are supported by opposite ends of a pair of transversely spaced, center mounted equalizing beams. Each equalizing beam 12 carries one of the transducers 24 which measures the deflection of the respective equalizing beam responsive to vehicle loading. The transducer includes a push rod 56 clamped to the equalizing beam and extending into a measurement block 50 which is clamped to a different point on the equalizing beam. The measurement block contains a strain gauge instrumented cantilever beam 74 against which the motion transmitting bar 56 abuts. Consequently, the cantilever beam deflects responsive to movement of the motion transmitting bar toward and away from the measurement block produced by load induced deflections of the equalizing beams. The transducer is secured to the equalizing beam by removable clamps 30 which accurately position the transducer on the equalizing beam and facilitate quick and easy installation of the transducer without altering the physical properties of the equalizing beam.
