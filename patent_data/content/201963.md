# Charge coupled device and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A charge coupled semiconductor device having a plural ity of silicon electrodes 1,3,5,7,9 for storing and transport ing information carrying charge, which electrodes are lo cated on an insulating layer 21 and are mutually separated by grooves having a width of at most 1 Âµm. According to the invention, transfer electrodes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are arranged in the grooves, these electrodes being coplanar to the remain ing electrodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 . The thickness of the insulating layer under the transfer electrodes is substantially equal to that under the storage electrodes. The invention also relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device having such an electrode system.
