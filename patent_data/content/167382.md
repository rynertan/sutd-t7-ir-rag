# LIQUID CLEANSING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
Aqueous liquid cleansing compositions comprise about 8 to 50 of primary surfactant selected from anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, amphoteric and semi polar surfactants, from about 0.1 to 6 of C₆ C₁₃ alcohol ethoxylate and from about 0.1 to 2 of a water soluble nonionic polymeric thickening agent, preferably guar gum or derivative thereof. The compositions have desirable foaming, product stability and skin feel characteristics.
