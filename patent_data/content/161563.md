# Method of and apparatus for manufacturing ultra fine particles.

## Abstract
In a method wherein arcs are struck across a material 10 to be vaporized into ultra fine particles and an electrode 11 , thereby to manufacture the ultra fine particles the material 10 to be turned into the ultra fine particles is arranged as at least one of the electrodes, and plasma currents are generated from the material 10 and the electrode 11 , whereby the for mation rate of the ultra fine particles per unit input is in creased, and the material 10 is formed in the shape of a rod or a wire, and a feeder 24 capable of continuously supplying the material 10 is disposed, whereby the ultra fine particles can be continuously manufactured.
