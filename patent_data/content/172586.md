# Medical infusor.

## Abstract
A portable elastomeric bladder powered infusor for dispensing drug in liquid form under pressure at a predeter mined flow rate is disclosed. The main elements of the infusor are a tubular housing 12 a plug flow control assembly 13 fixed in one end of the bladder, an axially slidable piston filling port assembly 14 within the housing, and a tubular bladder 15 . The plug and piston assemblies each has an axial post 22.44 about which the bladder ends are attached. When the bladder is not charged with drug, the posts fill the bladder s lumen and their ends abut. Drug is charged to the infusor by inserting a drug filled syringe into the open end of the housing with the syringe s needle entering an axial bore 47 in the piston, penetrating a septum 48 that blocks the bore, and extending into the axial post. The force exerted on the piston by the syringe is transmitted to the fixed plug assembly via the axial posts. Drug is expelled from the syringe causing the posts to separate and the bladder to expand axially and radially. Once the bladder is filled, the syringe is withdrawn, with the septum sealing itself. The drug is dispensed from the bladder via the plug flow control assembly and a conduit that is connected to that assembly and extends to the infusion site.
