# Method of forming a microscopic pattern.

## Abstract
A negative photoresist 5 having bezene rings is irradiated with short wavelength ultraviolet radiation. Be cause the benzene rings greatly absorb this radiation on developing a photoresist pattern is formed where sectional shape is an inverted trapezoid. An aluminum layer 4 is deposited, and is discontinuous because of the overhanging edges of the trapezoidal photo resist patterns. On removal of the photoresist, the layer 4 thereon is also lifted off, to leave an aluminum pattern of high precision without the troublesome steps which the lift off process has heretofore entailed.
