# Dentifrice composition.

## Abstract
The inclusion of epigallo catechin 3 gallate or a polyvalent metal salt, such as the zinc salt, of glycyrrhizinic acid in a dentifrice composition provides a dentifrice with a keratinisation promoting effect, which reduces gingivitis.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A dentifrice composition containing from 0.1 to 10 by weight of a keratinisation promoting agent selected from the group consisting of epigallocatechin 3 gallate, salts of polyvalent metals of glycyrrhizinic acid and mixtures thereof. 2. A composition according to claim 1, in which the keratinisation promoting agent is zinc glycyrrhizinate.

## Description
DENTIFRICE COMPOSITIONThe present invention relates to dentifrice compositions comprising certain additives affecting the keratinisation of the human gingiva.The sound human gingiva is protected on the surface by a horny layer of coreless little scales against exogenic influences, particularly of bacterial origin. In the sulcus this keratinized layer is lacking, so that the metabolic products of bacteria, e.g. of plaque bacteria, can penetrate from there into the parodontium, which can cause gingivitis, resulting, on further progress, in paradontosis and loosening of teeth. On inflammation of the gums the formation of core containing non keratinized cells is accelerated they are conveyed to the surface of the gingiva, where they reduce the so called keratinisation index, l.e. the amount of protective horny scales.The susceptibility of the gingiva to all kinds of exogenic irritations LS thus further increased.Since caries and paradontosis are world wide epidemics, for a long time a great variety of therapeutic or prophylactic active ingredients has been suggested or applied to reduce or remedy these defects, which are attributable to insufficient oral hygiene. The addition of such active ingredients to dentifrices, such as mouth washes, toothpastes, toothpowders, mouth tablets,etc. is also general practice. Typical examples of such active ingredients are vitamins, anti inflammatory agents, perfusion promoting agents, adstringents, antibiotics, etc.These ingredients include tartaric acid, urea, allantoin, pyridyl carbinol tartrate, D panthenol, alpha tocopherol, azulene, nicotinic acid amide, etc. However, as to their effectiveness, decisive evidence is often lacking, or relatively slight and only of a temporary nature. The object of the present invention was to find active ingredients which, when added to a dentifrice composition, can exert a permanent keratinising action on the intraoral mucosa.This object was attained in that it was found that epigallo catechin 3 gallate and zinc glycyrrhizinate exert such a desirable keratinising effect on the intra oral mucosa.The invention therefore relates to dentifrice composi tlons having a keratinisation promoting effect on the intra oral mucosa, characterized in that they contain an effective amount of eplgallo catechin 3 gallate and or salts of glycyrrhizinic acid and polyvalent metals, such as Al, Sn, Mg and Zn, preferably zinc glycyrrhizinnate.The content of active ingredients in the dentifrice compositions according to the invention is generally from O.1 to 10 percent by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 5 percent 5 weight, calculated on the finished dentifrice composition. The dentifrice compositions further comprise the constituents usually incorporated in all kinds of dentifrice compcsitions as they are known from the prior art for mouthwashes, toothpastes, toothpowders, mouth tablets, etc., e.g. from the Handbuch der Kosmetika und Riechstoffe , Vol.3, 1973, pages 777 ff, by H. Janistyn.The eplgallo catechln 3 gallate is a substance known per se, having the followiny structural formula EMI2.1 This compound can be prepared from gallic acid and catechin however, it is also found in nature, e.g. in green tea, and can be obtained therefrom.Zinc glycyrrhizinate is the zinc salt of glycyrrhizinic acid this acid is the glycoside of glycyrrhetinic acid.Glycyrrhizinic acid is found in nature, particularly in licorice roots, from which it is obtained by means of extraction. The zinc salt is obtained by reaction of the acid with a suitable zinc compound, such as zinc chloride, zinc hydroxide, zinc sulphate or zinc citrate.The epigallo catechin 3 gallate is readlly water soluble in the concentration to be used, whereas the zinc glycyrrhizinate is not. The latter remains in suspension as a white powder,but it can be finely dispersed in oily carriers, or suspended or dissolved in hydro alcoholic sclutions.The zinc glycyrrhizinate can be prepared separately and then incorporated into the dentrifice composition it can however also be formed in situ in the dentrifice composition, if glycyrrhizinic acid or an alkalimetal or ammonium salt thereof arid a suitable zinc compound, e.g. zinc citrate, are added to the dentifrice composition.ExampLe 1For experiments on the human gingiva an exfoliativecytological investigation was carried out with five testpanels each comprising 2 persons a man and a woman over a period of 7 days. As test products the following compositions were used Group A a conventional toothpaste on the basis of aluminiumoxide trihydrate as abrasive, with titanium dioxide, polysaccharide, sodiumbenzo ate, sodiumlaurylsulpha te, flavours, sorbitol and water Group B a conventional toothpaste based on silica gel as abrasive, with titanium dioxide, CMC, polyethylene glycol, sodiumlaurylsulphate, fla vours, sorbitol, water and 1 of sodiummono fluorophosphate.Group C Basis as for A, but with addition of 4.5 of zinc glycyrrhizinate and 0.8 of sodiummono fluorophosphate Group D an aqueous solution of 0.5t of epigallo catechin 3 gallate Group an aqueous solution of 0.758 of epigallo cathe chin 3 gallate. The toothpastes of Groups A and B were current toothpastes and were used as placebos.The test panellists brushed their teeth twice daily for 2 minutes with one of the toothpastes A C. In Groups D andE, in addition to brushing with toothpaste A, the solution ons were allowed to act on the gingiva for 1 minute by means of a little sponge. Each day cell scrapings were taken from the right hand top section of the teeth, which were evaluated cytologically. After the usual colouring according to the method of Papanicolaou the keratinisation index K.I. was determined this indicates the proportional ratio of core less horny scales to the total amount of the cells.The following results were obtained EMI5.1 tb Tooth SEP I SEP Keratinisation SEP Index tb Ipaste SEP Start SEP 1st SEP 2nd SEP 3rd SEP 4th SEP 5th SEP 6th SEP 7th tb solution SEP I SEP day SEP day SEP day SEP day SEP day SEP day SEP day tb A SEP A SEP 1 SEP 7 SEP 9 SEP 5 SEP 5 SEP 6 SEP 10 SEP 7 SEP 5 tb B SEP B SEP 1 SEP 35 SEP 30 SEP 22 SEP 30 SEP 23 SEP 18 SEP 27 SEP 25 tb IC SEP t SEP 37 SEP 37 SEP 41 SEP 47 SEP 40 SEP 50 SEP 73 SEP 84 tb D SEP D SEP 1 SEP 29 SEP 40 SEP 42 SEP 44 SEP 46 SEP 49 SEP 53 SEP 76 tb E SEP E SEP 1 SEP 58 SEP 40 SEP 54 SEP 54 SEP 55 SEP 64 SEP 68 SEP 85 tb The placebos thus showed a slight reduction in keratisation on the 7th day as compared with the starting value C D, on the other hand, showed a considerable increase and are far above the value of 52 indicated by Lange for sound gingiva.Example 2Experiments were also carried out on guinea pigs, viz. two test series with 9 animals each a for 7 days b for 21 days.Each morning before feeding, a little sponge, which had been soaked in the test product for 1 minute, was pressed on to the inner right side of the oral mucous membrane of each test animal for a period of 2 minutes.

The keratinising effect still lasts after 3 weeks.Consequently, the active ingredients according to the invention are suitable for promoting the keratinisation of the human mucosa, in particular as additives to dentifrice compositions. Within the scope of prophylactic measures toothpastes, mouthwashes etc. in which these substances have been incorporated, can advantageously be used for the purpose of permanent oral hygiene.
