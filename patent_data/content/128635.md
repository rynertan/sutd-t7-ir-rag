# Measuring non linear parameter of acoustic medium.

## Abstract
Measurement of a non linear parameter of an acoustic medium, or its distribution, for example for determining the internal temperature of a sample, is carried out noninvasively. A continuous wave ultrasonic probing beam is radiated through the sample, and a pumping wave which is an ultrasonic pulse wave is superposed on the probing beam. Phase changes of the probing beam caused by the pumping wave are detected. From these phase changes the non linear parameter B A or B A In ohne case the pumping wave intersects the probing beam. In another case the pumping wave is directed along the probing beam, in the opposite direction.
