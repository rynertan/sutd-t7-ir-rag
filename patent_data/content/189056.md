# Method for restoring the current efficiency.

## Abstract
In the electrolysis of sodium chloride by means of a per fluoro cation exchange membrane for the production of so dium hydroxide having a concentration of from 32 to 40 by weight, a method for restoring the current efficiency, which comprises suspending the electrolysis when the current ef ficiency of the perfluoro cation exchange membrane has dropped to a predetermined level, and maintaining the ca tholyte concentration at a level of not higher than 30 by weight.
