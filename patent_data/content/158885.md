More particularly, this invention relates t6 polymer polyol dispersions which contain a copolymer and a terpolymer that lead to improved combustion resistance in polyurethane foams prepared therefrom. This invention also relates to novel polyurethane foams and elastomers prepared from such polymer polyol dispersions. methods of preparing the polymer polyol dispersions and methods of preparing the polyurethane foam and elastomers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The basic technology for the preparation of polymer polol dispersions useful in producing polyurethane foams. elastomers and the like is described in U.S. Patents No. 3.304.273. 3.383.351. Re. 28.715 and Re 29.118 . Such dispersions can be produced by polymerizing one or more olefinically unsaturated monomers dissolved or dispersed in a polyol in the presence of a free radical catalyst. Polymer polyol dispersions. vhen used in producing polyurethane foams and elastomers.impart higher load bearing properties to polyurethane foams and elastomers than are exhibited by such product6 prepared from unmodified polyols. Many commercial molded highresilience polyurethane foams are produced from an isocyanate blend blend of tolylene diisocyanates and a polymeric isocyanate and from a polymer polyol derived from acrylonitrile and styrene. However.these foams have poor Combustion resistance. U.S. patent 4,214,055 discloses that high resilience combustion resistant polyurethane foams can be produced from polymer polyols wherein the polymer is comprised of a major amount of polymerized vinylidene chloride and a minor amount of acrylonitrile. U.S. patent 4,242,476 discloses that the combustion resistance of polyurethane foams made from polymer polyols containing acrylonitrile can be improved by copolymerizing vinylidene chloride in an amount from 5 to 45 , based on the total weight of monomers in the polymer. EP A1 0095653 hereinafter referred to as theSimroth application discloses that polymer polyols made from chloride containing monomers are undesirable because of the dehydrochlorination associated with such monomers. Simroth teaches that improved cosbustion resistance of polyurethane foams can be obtained if the crosslinking coefficient of the polymer polyol is kept below about SS.The reduction of the crosslinking coefficient of the polymer polyol dispersion is accomplished by controlling a variety of process parameters such as increasing the free radical polymerization catalyst concentration, lowering the residence time reducing the proportion of acrylonitrile in the system and increasing the concentration of r chain transfer agent. However. it has been found that even with careful control of the above parameters. the improved combustion resistance of the polyurethane foams disclosed by Simroth often vary widely. Accordingly. there is a need for polymer polyol dispersions which impart greater combustion resistance to the polyurethane foams prepared therefrom without incurring the drawbacks previously encountered. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a stable polymerSpolyol dispersion which comprises a a polyol having a hydroxyl number from 20 to 150 b a copolymer containing from about 0.5 weight percent to 90 weight percent. based on the weight of the copolymer, of polymerized acrylonitrile and from 10 weight percent to 99 5 weight percent. based on the copolymer. of at least one other polymerized halocarbon free monomer as hereinafter defined , wherein the copolymer is characterized by a crosslinking coefficient of less than 55 and c a terpolymer containing from 0.5 weight percent to 45 weight percent, based on the terpolymer. of a polymerized halocarbon monomer as hereinafter defined . from ... .Put.. percent to 50 weight percent, based on the terpolymer. of polymerized acrylonitrile and from 79.5 weight percent to 5t weight percent, based on the terpolymer. of at least one other polymeri ed ethylenically unsaturated monomer wherein the total amount of polyol in the dispersion is from 45 weight percent to 95 weight percent, based on the total weight of the dispersion. the total amount of copolymer and terpolymer in the dispersion is from 5 weight percent to 55 weight percent. based on the total weight of the dispersion, and the weight ratio of copolymer to terpolymer in the dispersion is such that the amount of chlorine or brosine attached to an aliphatic carbon atom is from 0.2 weight percent to 18 weight percent. based on the total weight of the dispersion. Halocarbon monomer as used herein means any ethylenically unsaturated monomer which. when polymerized, contains at least one chlorine atom or at least one bromine atom attached to an aliphatic carbon atom. Halocarbon free monomer as used herein means an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which.when polymerized. contains no chlorine or bromine atoms attached to an aliphatic carbon atom. This invention also provides a blend process for making such polyer polyols. a process for using such polymer polyols to make a combustion resistant polyurethane foam, and combustion resistant polyurethane foams produced thereby. It has been found that the polymer polyols of this invention have consistently improved combustion resistance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The stable polyiner polyol dispersions of this invention contain a polyol. a certain copolymer and a certain terpolymer. Illustrative of the polyols useful in producing polymer polyol compositions in accordance with this invention are the polyhydroxyalkanes. the polyoxyalkylene polyols, the polyoxyalkylene polyesters . Among the polyols which can be employed are those selected from one or more of the following classes of compositions, alone or in admixture. known to those skilled in the polyurethane art a alkylene oxide adducts of polyhydroxyalkanes b alkylene oxide adducts of non reducing sugars and sugar derivatives c alkylene oxide adducts of phosphorus and polyphosphorus acids d alkylene oxide adducts of polyphenols e the polyols from natural oils such as castor oil, Illustrative alkylene oxide adducts of polyhydroxyalkanes include. among others. the alkylene oxide adducts of ethylene glycol, propylene glycol. 1.3 dihydroxypropane. 1.4 dihydroxybutane. and 1.6 dihydroxyhexane. glycerol. 1.2.4 trihydroxybutane, 1,2,6 trihydroxyhexane, 1,1,1 tri methylolethane, 1,1,1 trimethylolpropane pentaerthritol, polycaprolactone, xylitol, arabitol, sorbitol. annitol, . A preferred class of alkylene oxide adducts of polyhydroxyalkanes are the ethylene oxide and propylene oxide adducts of trihydroxyalkanes. The polyols employed can have hydroxyl numbers which vary over a vide range. In general, the bydroxyl numbers of the polyols employed in the invention can range from 20 to 150. The hydroxyl number is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide equivalent to the hydroxyl content of one gram of polyol. The hydroxyl number can also be defined by the equation 56.1 X 1000 x f A where m.w. OH hydroxyl number of the polyol f functionality. that is. a average number of hydroxyl groups per molecule of polyol m.w. molecular weight of the polyol. The particular polyol employed depends upon the end use of the polyurethane product to be produced. The molecular weight or the hydroxyl number is selected properly to result in flexible or semi flexible foams or elastomers when the polymer polyol dispersion produced from the polyol is converted to a polyurethane. The polyols preferably possess a bydroxyl number of from 50 to 150 for semi flexible foams. and from 20 to 70 for flexible foams. Such limits are not intended to be narrowly restrictive.but are merely illustrative of the large number of possible combinations of the above polyol coreactants. if desired. a polyol blend containing a small amount of a high molecular weight polyol and a major amount of a low or a medium molecular weight polyol can be used. Also. a polyol polyxer polyol blend containing a small amount of a polymer polyol prepared in a high molecular weight polyol and a major amount of a low or a medium molecular weight polyol. as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4.148.840.can be used as the polyol component. The most preferred polyols employed in this invention include the poly oxypropylene glycols. triols. higher functionality polyols and any of these that are capped with ethylene oxide. These polyols also include poly oxypropyleneoxy ethylene polyols however, desirably. the oxyethylene content should comprise less than 80 percent of the total and preferably less than 60 percent. The ethylene oxide. when used. can be incorporated in any fashion along the polymer chain. Stated another way. the ethylene oxide can be incorporated either in internal blocks. as terminal blocks. or may be randomly distributed along the polymer chain. As is well known in the art. the polyols that are most preferred herein contain varying small amounts of unsaturation. As taught by U.S. Pat.Nos. 3,304,273, 3,383,351, and Re. 28.71S . unsaturation in itself does not affect in any adverse way the formation of the polymer polyols in accordance with the present invention except in the case where the extent or type of unsaturation is so high or effective as to result in a dispersion of the polymer in a polyol that is gel led. Thus small amounts of unsaturation can be incorporated into the polyol without departing from the scope of the present invention. The copolymers in the polymeripolyol dispersions of this invention contain from . 0.5 weight percent to 90 weight percent. based on the weight of the copolymer, of polymerized acrylonitrile and from 10 weight percent to 99.5 weight percent of another polymerized halocarbon free monomer. The copolymers are characterized by a crosslinking coefficient of less than about 55. Polymerized acrylonitrile is a necessary monomer in the copolymers in dispersions of this invention, because it forms polymerlpolyol dispersions that are stable to phase separation and that produce polyurethane foams having superior load bearing properties.The weight percent of polymerized acrylonitrile in the copolymer can range from 0.5 to 90 , more preferably from 20 to 80S and aost preferably from 30 to 70 . Suitable polymerizable halocarbon free monomers include styrene. p methylstyrene.p chlorostyrene. acrylates. methacrylates, methacrylonitrile, vinyl acetate. . For a more detailed list of comonomers, reference is made to U.S. Patent Nos. 3.931. 092 and 4.093.573. As disclosed in the Simroth application.the degree of crosslinking of a copolymer in a polymer polyol dispersion used to make a polyurethane foams at focts the combustion resistance of the polyurethane foam. In general, a copolymer with a low degree of crosslinking leads to a polyurethane foam having greater combustion resistance. The degree of crosslinking of the copolymer is a function of many variables. The lost significant are the weight percent of polymerized acrylonitrile in the copolymer and three process parameters in the polymerization of the copolymer the concentration of free radical polymerization catalyst, the residence time of the monomers, copolymer and polyol in the polymerization reactor, and the concentration of a chain transfer agent. In general. a lower degree of crosslinking is observed with lower weight percents of polymerized acrylonitrile. higher catalyst concentration, lower residence time and higher concentrations of chain transfer agents. The degree of crosslinking of a copolymer in a polymer polyol dispersion can be expressed as a crosslinking coefficient. The crosslinking coefficient XLC is defined, as in the Simroth application as follows XLC 100 LT vherein LT is the light transmission of a dispersion or solution of the copolymer containing polymer polyol in dimethyl formamide DMF . which is determined in accordance with the following procedure, A sample of the copolymer containing polymeripolyol dispersion is mixed vith DM such , , 0 0 that the resulting mixture contains one percent copolymer by weight of the resulting mixture.This mixture is transferred to one of two matched 1 cm. transmission cells while the second matched cell is filled with DMF experimental analysis has indicated that the influence of any polyol added to DMF is insignificant within the bounds of normal statistical error and thus can be dispensed with in the control cell . A spectrophotometer, such as aBausch and Lomb Spectronic 710, is calibrated to 100 percent transmission for the transmission of light at 500 millimicrons wave length through the second.DMF filled cell. After this calibration the percent light transmission through the first. polymer I polyol DMF filled cell is measured and referred to as LT for light transmission. Experimentation has demonstrated that when the stable dispersion of a polymer in a polyol has an XLC value of less than 55 improvement in the combustion resistance of the resulting polyurethane becomes significantly apparent. It is preferred that the XLC value be 50 or less with values 20 or less the more preferred and a value of about zero 0 being the most preferred since it represents the least crosslinked polymer. It should be noted that although the copolymer in the dispersions of this invention has a low crosslinking coefficient. the light transmission values of the polymer polyol dispersions of this invention may be low due to a high cross linking coefficient of the terpolymer in the polymer polyol dispersions. The terpolymers in the polymer polyol compositions of this invention contain fYo 0.5 weight percent to 45 weight percent polymerized halocarbon monomer. from 10 weight percent to 50 weight percent polymerized acrylonitrile and a weight percent balance of another polymerized ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Suitable halocarbon monomers include vinyl chloride, 2.3 dibrosopropyl acrylate or methacrylate, 2,3 dichioropropyl acrylate or methacrylate. chloromethylstyrene . The preferred halocarbon monomer is vinylidene chloride. The weight percentage of polymerized halocarbon monomer in the terpolymer ranges from 0.5S to 45 . more preferably from 1 to 30 and most preferably from 3 to 10 . The weight percentage of polymerized acrylonitrile can range from 20 to 50 , more preferably from 25 to 40 and most preferably from 30 to 35 . The other polymerized monomer, which makes up the balance of the weight of the terpolymer. is any other ethylenically unsaturated monomer such methacrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate. o methylstyrene, para methylstyrene or, preferably, styrene. The total concentration of copolymer and terpolymer in the polymer polyol compositions of this invention can range from 5 weight percent to 55 weight percent, based on the total weight of the dispersion. more preferably from 10 to 45 , and most preferably from 20 to 40 . The total concentration of polyol.plus optional stabilizers and other additives rake up the remainder of the dispersion. The weight ratio of copolymer to terpolymer is adjusted such that the amount of chlorine or bromine bonded directly to an aliphatic carbon atom in the dispersion ranges from . 0.2t to 18 . more preferably from 0.5 to 12 , and most preferably from 1 to 7 based on the total weight of the dispersion. The stable polymer polyol dispersion of this invention can be prepared in any manner that will result in a polymer polyol dispersion which contains a copolymer and a terpolymer as described above, in the amounts described above, wherein the copolymer has the crosslinking coefficient described above. One convenient method, hereinafter the Blend Method , is to separately prepare two polymer polyols. one containing only the copolymer a copolymer polyol and one containing only the terpolymer a terpolymer polyol . The crosslinking coefficient of the copolymer can then be determined by measuring the light transmission of the copolymer polyol. The two polymer polyols are then blended in amounts calculated to yield the desired total concentration of copolymer and terpolymer and the weight ratio of copolymer to terpolymer that vill yield the necessary levels of aliphatic chlorine or bromine.No special blending or mixing equipment is required to ensure efficient and complete mixing of the polymer polyols to obtain the stable plymer polyol dispersion of this invention by the Blend Method. The copolymer polyols useful in making the stable polymeripolyol dispersions of this invention can be made in accordance vith the procedures described in the Simroth application. The process used in producing the copolymer polYol compositions useful in this invention involves polymerizing the monomers in the polyol while maintaining a low monomer to polyol ratio throughout the reaction mixture during the polymerization. Such low ratios are achieved by employing process conditions that provide rapid conversion of monomer to polymer.In practice, a low monomer to polyol ratio is maintained, in the case of semi batch and continuous operation. by use of a free radical polymerization catalyst. control of the temperature and mixing conditions and. in the case of semi batch operation by slowly adding the monomers to the polyol. The mixing conditions employed are those attained using a back mixed reactor. a stirred flask or a stirred autoclave. Such reactors keep the reaction mixture relatively homogeneous and so prevent localized high monomer to polyol ratios such as occur in certain tubular reactors. However, tubular reactors can be employed if modified so that increments of the monomer are added to various stages. The process variables identified above as influencing the degree of crosslinking interact between themselves in such a manner that no one individual variable has parameters which in and of themselves are critical in attaining the necessary degree of crosslinking. In other world the selection of the level of any one varabiedepe nds upon the levels selected for the remaining variables ruch that the combination of variables results in aXLC valve within the limits defined as necessary to obtain the desired end product. Improvement has been observed by increasing the catalyst concentration. lowering the residence time, reducing the proportion of acrylonitrile in the copolymer, increasing the concentration of a chain transfer agent, or various combinations of the above.Preferred ranges are indicated for each variable.Although individual levels for each variable may be selected on the basis of product needs or economic considerations, the overall combination must result in the proper XLC value as determined by the test procedure set forth above. Control of residence tiae has been found useful in controlling the degree of crosslinking.In a continuous operation to produce a stable dispersion of a polymer in a polyol the residence time in the first reactor has been found to substantially control the degree of crosslinking in the polymer. By residence time in a continuous operation what is meant is that tiae calculated by dividing the reactors volume by the volumetric flow rate of the total feed to the reactor. Residence times of from 1 minute to 5 hours can be esployed, preferably 10 minutes to 2 hours. In a semi batch operation where the reactor can be partially charged prior to initiating poly merization. the term residence time refers to that .. period of time during which significant polymer ization between the acrylonitrile and the comonomer s is occurring. Here, residence times of from 30 minutes to 10 hours are recommended. The monomer feed insofar as it relates to the percent copolymer in the dispersion of polymer in the polyol is not limiting so long as the final dispersion is stable and does not separate out upon standing. In this regard. total copolymer in the dispersion can range from . 5 weight percent to up to or greater than 60 weight percent. The polymerization can also be carried out with an inert organic solvent present. The only requirements in the selection of the solvent is that it does not dissolve the copolymer nor interfere with the monomer s polymerization reaction. When an inert organic solvent is used. it is generally removed from the reaction mixture by conventional means before the polymer polyol dispersion of this invention is used to produce polyurethane foams. The catalysts useful in producing the copolymer polyol dispersions are the well known free radical type vinyl polymerization catalysts for the formation of polymer polyols. for example, peroxides. azo compounds such as azobisisobutyronitrile, and mixtures thereof. The catalyst concentration useful in controlling the degree of crosslinking should range from 0.1 to 5.0 weight percent based on the total feed to the reactor and preferably from 0.3 to 1.0. Although. as mentioned above any free. radical type vinyl polymerization catalyst can be tied. 2,2 azobis isobutyronitrile is preferred because ir does not increase the acid number of the product. does not impart an objection able odor to the product. and does not require special handling. as compared to certain peroxide catalysts. The temperature used in producing the copolymer polyol dispersions is any temperature at which the catalyst has a desirable rate of decomposition under the reaction conditions. In the case of a continuous process. reaction temperatures of greater than lOO C are preferred. The maximum temperature used is not narrowly critical but should be lower than the temperature at which significant decomposition of the product occurs. By way of illustration. 2,2 azobis isobutyronitrile has a preferred temperature range from 1O50C to 135 C. Temperatures at which the half life of the catalyst is no longer than about six minutes are desirable. Temperatures of typical catalysts with half lives of six sinutes are Catalyst Temperature Azobisisobutyronitrile lOOC Lauroyl Peroxide 100 C Decanoyl Peroxide 1000C Benzoyl Peroxide 1150C p Chlorobenzoyl Peroxide 115 C t Butyl Peroxyisobutyrate 115 C Acetyl Peroxide 105eC Propionyl Peroxide 102 C 2 t Butylazo 2 cyanobutane 129 C Finally, the addition of chain transfer agents to the polymerization has been demonstrated to be useful in controlling the degree of crosslinking.Chain transfer agents may be added in an amount from 0.1 to 10 weight percent or more based on the total feed to the reactor and preferably from 1 to 5 weight percent.Suitable chain transfer agents include any material that exhibits chain transfer activity. Useful classes of chain transfer agents include mercaptans.ketones. alcohols, aldehydes. halogenated compounds.benzene derivatives Chain transfer agents selected from among such classes may be used alone or in combination. The preferred chain transfer agent is isopropanol due to its low toxicity, low odor. availability. cost effectiveness and ease of removal. The terpolymer polyol dispersions useful in making the stable polymer polyol dispersions of this invention by the Blend Method can be made by the procedures described above for making the copolymer polyol dispersions useful in the Blend Method However, in the making of the terpolymer polyol dispersion, it is not necessary to control the process parameters. such as catalyst concentration. residence time. use of chain transfer agents. which affect the degree of crosslinking of the terpolymer. In producing the terpolymer polyol dispersions, dehydrohalogenation may occur, especially at high reaction and stripping temperatures above 100 C. . To minimize the problems associated with dehydrohalogenation the concentration of halocarbon monomer in the monomer feed should be adjusted such that the weight percentage of polymerized halocarbon monomer in the terpolymer is less than about 45 percent. A continuous process having the shortest possible residence time instead of a semi batch process is preferred. The use of an epoxidized oil andSor a metal stabilizer to prevent thermal degradation during processing and to extend the service life of finished products is known in the art of polymers which contain halocarbon monomers. However, not all of these stabilizers work in controlling dehydrohalogenation in the terpolymer polyol dispersions used in the Blend Method. The acid number which is indicative of the degree of dehydrohalogenation of the terpolymertpolyols can be kept to an acceptable level by adding an epoxy plasticizer to the unstripped product. In a preferred embodiment. an epoxidized oil is added to the polyol stream before polymerization. For example. small amounts of epoxidized soybean oil e.g.. Flexol Plasticizer EPO or octyl epoxytallate e.g.. Flexor Plasticizer EP 8 have been found to be efficacious in controlling dehydrochlorination of the terpolymers useful in this invention. When producing either a copolymer polyol or a terpolymer polyol due consideration must be given to the reactivity ratios of the chosen monomers and the effect of the reactivity ratios on monomer conversion. For example, the low reactivity of a given monomer with the other comonoxef6 Sa9 fegult In lower conversions of the comonomers and thereby affect the monomer composition of the resulting polymer polyol. The reactivity ratios and expected monomer conversions should therefore be taken into account when the composition of the monomer feed stream is selected to produce the copolymer and terpolymers useful in this invention. In addition to the preferred Blend Method described above. the polymer polyol dispersions of this invention can be made by any other suitable method. For example. the polymer polyols of this invention can be made by producing the copolymers in the total amount of polyol desired in the final polymer polyol dispersion. This method involves producing an intermediate dilute copolymer dispersion. The cross linking coefficient of the copolymer in the dilute dispersion can be measured.Then the monomers used to produce the terpolymer can be polymerized in the dilute copolymer polyol to produce the final polymer polyol dispersion of this invention. In the polymer polyol dispersions of this invention. the polymers copolymers and terpolymers are stably dispersed in the polyol. The means for achieving stability in polymer polyol dispersions are well known in the art. Such means include proper selection of polyol molecular weight. polymer concentration, catalysts. stabilizing additives.mixing conditions. The invention also provides novel flexible to semi flexible polyurethane foams or elastomers produced by reacting a a polymer polyol dispersion of this invention and b an organic polyisocyanate in the presence of e a catalyst.The reaction can be performed in any suitable manner such as by the prepolymer or one shot technique.When the polyurethane is a foam. the reaction mixture may also contain a polyol such as the one used to make the polymer polyol. a blowing agent.and a foam stablizer. The invention also provides novel polyurethane elastomers produced by reacting a a polymer polyol dispersion of this invention and b a polyisocyanate compound in the presence of c a catalyst for the reaction of a and b .

The preferred polyisocyanates are a mixture of 80 2,4 tolylene diisocyanate and 20 2.6 tolylene diisocyanate hereinafter TDI and a mixture that is about 80t TDI and about 20t of a polymeric isocyanate.

The feed components were pumped into the reactor continuously after going through an inline mixer to assure cosplete mixing of the feed components before entering the reactor. The internal temperature of the reactor was controlled to within one degreeCentrigrade. The contents of the reactor were well mixed.The product flowed out Cf the top of the reactor continuously through a back pressure regulator that had been adjusted to give some positive back pressure in the reactor. Portions of the crude product were vacuum stripped at 2 millimeters absolute pressure and 1200 to 1300C for testing. Conversions were determined from analysis of the amount of unreacted monomers present in the crude product before stripping. All of the polymer polyols in the Examples were stable compositions.
