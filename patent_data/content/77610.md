# Insulation displacing wire splicing connectors.

## Abstract
A connector for connecting at least two insulated conductors, for example telephone line conductors, comprises a hollow body and a hollow cap, the cap, in a typical example fitting into the body to form an enclosure. The front of the body has apertures and guides for admission and guidance of conductors thereinto and the cap has insulation displacing terminals set in a top web. When body and cap are pressed together the terminals make contact with the conductive cores of the conductors. Terminal arrangements permit of butt, bridge and tap connections. A modified form of body permits a tap to be made to a continuous conductor. The cap and body can be provided in a partially assembled or first stage assembly which permits insertion of conductors, the cap and body then being pressed to a fully assembled or second stage assembly for connection of the conductors.

## Description
TNSULATION DTSI LACINc wIR1 SPLICING CONNECTORS This invention relates to connectors with insulation displacing terminals, particularly, although not exclusively, for connecting wires of telecommunications systems. The connector of the invention is particularly suited to the connection of the Tip andRing conductors of telephone systems. There are many existing connectors, of varying forms, with various disadvantages, the disadvantages differing with the form of the connector. Typical disadvantages are lack of effective guidance of conductors into a connector inability to test other than by piercing the insulation of conductors exterior to the connector, resulting in a perforated insulation need to separately pair up Tip and Ring conductors for connection use of two connectors for a butt connection inability to interconnect three conductors inadequate sealing against water ingress. The particular disadvantages pertaining to any particular connector vary, and other disadvantages can also be present. Ideally a connector should make a variety of conrections, e.g. butt, bridge and tap, with various types of plastic, paper and pulp insulation. Connectors should be reliable over a long period of time and also have a high level of environmental protection. As they are used in large numbers, they should be inexpensive and easy to install. The present invention provides a connector with improved mechanical and electrical characteristics is easily manufactured and inexpensive is small in size and can be provided with Easy access which facilitates testing. A connector, in accordance with the invention, comprises d body and a cap, the cap interrelating with the body and held together by interlocking formations. Insulation displacing terminals are retained in the cap, the insulated conductors being inserted laterally into the body. Final assembly of the connector forces the terminals into electrical contact with the conductors. The terminals may be in pairs, for certain forms of interconnections, for example a butt connection, and in a strip of four terminals, the strip bent into aU shape for other forms of interconnections such as bridge and full tap.The body has two versions, each with four entry apertures, one version also having a side slot for a tap connection. A sealing compound is normally added before or after the connector parts are assembled. Various features and details of the invention will be appreciated from the following description of certain embodiments, with respect to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the two parts of a connector of one form Figure 2 is similar to Figure 1 and illustrates the alternative form of body Figure 3 is a top plan view of the body of the connector of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a front view of the body of Figure 3 Figure 5 is a cross section on the line V V of Figure 3 Figure 6 is a cross section on the line VI VI of Figure 4 Figure 7 is a cross section on the line Vil Vil of Figure 3 Figure 8 is a bottom plan view of the body of Figure 3 Figure 9 is a top plan view oF the body of the connector of Figure 2 Figure 10 is a front view of the body of Figure 9 Figure 11 is a cross section on the line XI XI of Figure 9 Figure 12 is a cross section on the line XII XII ofFigure 10 Figure 13 is a cross section on the line XIII XIII ofFigure 9 Figure 14 is a bottom plan view of the body of Figure 9 Figure 15 is a top plan view of an alternative form of body, similar in many respects to that of the connector of Figure 1 Figure 16 is a front view of the body of Figure 15 Figure 17 is a cross section on the line XVII XVII of Figure 15 Figure 18 is a cross section on the line XVIII XVIII ofFigure 15 Figure 19 is a bottom plan view of the body of Figure 15 Figure 20 is a plan view of one form of cap as in the connectors of Figures 1 and 2 Figures 21, 22 and 23 are side views and end view in the directions of arrows A, B and C respectively, in Figure 20 Figures 24 and 25 are cross sections on the lines XXIV XXIV and XXV XXV respectively in Figure 20 Figure 26 is a plan view of a further form of cap Figure 27 is a view on the front of the cap of Figure 26, in the direction of arrow D in Figure 26 and is also a view on the back as in the direction of arrow E in Figure 26 Figure 28 is an end view in the direction of arrow F inFigure 26 Figure 29 is a cross section on the line XXIX XXIX of Figure 26 Figure 30 is a cross section on the line XXX XXX of Figure 26 Figures 31 and 32 are side view and top plan view respectively of a terminal form as used with the connector of Figure 1 Figures 33, 34 and 35 are side view, top plan view and end view respectively of a terminal form as used with the connector of Figure 2 Figure 36 a and b are face and side views respectively of the end of one form of electrical probe Figures 37 a , b and c are diagrammatic illustrations of various forms of connections to be made with connectors of the present invention. As previously stated, a connector comprises a body and a cap, the body being capable of having forms depending, amongst other things, on the use. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate two alternate connectors.Figure 1 illustrates a connector having a body 10 and cap 11 which interrelate to form the connector. The cap holds four terminals 12 in two pairs 13 and 14, the pairs being in parallel, spaced apart relationship and with the terminals of one pair offset laterally to the other. Four conductors 35 are shown inserted. In the connector illustrated in Figure 2, an alternative form of body 15 is used, with the same cap 11 as in Figure 1. Four terminals 12 are in the cap, the terminals in one strip which is bent in a U shape with the two legs of the U in parallel spaced apart relationship, a pair of terminals 12 in each leg and the terminals in one leg offset laterally relative to the terminals in the other leg. In this arrangement one continuous conductor 36 and the end of a conductor 37 are shown inserted. One form of the body 10 of the connector of Figure 1 is illustrated in more detail in Figures 3 to 8. The body 10, as appreciated from Figure 1, is of hollow box like form having a relatively thick front wall 16, sides 17 and back 18, all extending up from a bottom surface or web 19. In the front wall are four apertures 20. The forward ends of the apertures 20 are chamfered at 21, to aid in inserting conductors into the apertures. The bottom web 19 has three upstanding ribs 22, 23 and 24 extending laterally and apertures 25 extend through the ribs, aligned with apertures 20. The ribs define two lateral channels 26. A peripheral channel or space 27 extends all round inside the front wall and sides.Extending between the back 18 and the rib 24 are separators 28. Adjacent to the top edge of each side 17, on the inside thereof, is an inwardly projecting rib 29. These ribs 29 are of a truncated conical cross section, as seen in Figures 5 and 7. The body 15 of the connector of Figure 2 is illustrated in more detail in Figures 9 to 14. The body 15 is similar in most respects to that of body 10 and where applicable the same reference numerals have been applied to the same items. Thus there is the thick front wall 16, sides 17 and back 18, extending up from the bottom web 19. Apertures 20, chamfered at 21 are in the front wall 16 and the three upstanding ribs 22, 23 and 24 define channels 26 and have apertures 25 therein. Inwardly extending ribs 29 extend along the inside of each side 17, adjacent to the top edge. Thus far the bodies 10 and 15 are the same.A difference in body 15 is the slot or groove 30 in one of the sides 17, the right hand side in Figures 9 and 10 for the particular embodiment illustrated. The slot 30 extends laterally to break through into the apertures 20 and 25 closest to the related side having the slot 30. This is seen in Figures 10 and 11. In this particular example the separators 28 are not provided. The slot 30 extends through the front wall 16 and the side 17, being tapered inwardly, to form a converging slot. However, at the back, the slot is reduced in width, at 31. This reduces substantially the relative deflection of the body when the body and cap are fully assembled. Also, the escape of grease is reduced when the end aperture is not used to receive a continuous conductor. At the forward ends of the bores 25 in the ribs 22 chamfers 32 can be formed, seen in Figures 3 and 9, and also in Figures 6 and 12.These chamfers cooperate with ribs on one form of cap, as will be described. Figures 15 to 19 illustrate a modified form of the body 10 illustrated in Figures 3 to 8. To a major extent the body of Figures 15 to 19 is the same as that of Figures 3 to 8. Certain modifications have been made however to improve dielectric separation between conductors, and between conductors and terminals, and to improve sealing against moisture. Where features are common, common references are used. The body 10 is of boxr e form having a relatively thick front wall 16, sides 17 and back 18, all extending up from a bottom web 19. In the front wall are four apertures 20. The forward ends of the apertures are chamfered, at 21, to aid in inserting conductors. Extending up from the bottom web 19 are ribs 35, 36 and 37.The rear rib 37 is integral with the back wall for the height of the central body, which is very approximately, in the example illustrated, about half the height of the back wall. Ribs 35 and 36 are parallel to the front and back walls, front rib 35 connected to center rib 36 by sections 38, and central rib 36 connected to the rear rib 37 by sections 39. Apertures 25 extend through the ribs 35, 36 and 37, in alignment with apertures 20. A channel 40 extends along the front and each side. Adjacent to the top edge of each side 17, on the inside, is an inwardly projecting rib 29 of truncated cross section. In this embodiment, short channels are formed or defined by the ribs 35, 36, 37 and sections 38 and 39. The channels connect or communicate with the apertures 25, for the passage of terminals, in the cap, to make contact with conductors. Thus, as seen in Figure 15 particularly, four channels 42, 43, 44 and 45 are formed, channels 42 43 form one pair, in alignment, and positioned to intercept alternate apertures 25 between ribs 35 and 36. Channels 44 and 45 form a second pair, in alignment, and positioned to intercept the other alternate apertures 25, between ribs 36 and 37. Channels 42 and 45 extend into channel 40. The arrangement of individual channels 42 to 45, instead of continuous channels 26 as in Figure 3, ensures that if an installer does not push a conductor right in, a cut end of a conductor is not exposed close to a terminal. For example, in Figure 3, if in the rear channel 26, the terminals contact conductors in the second and fourth apertures 25, counting from the left, then a conductor in either the first or third aperture or both , if not fully inserted, could have its end exposed in the channel. There could result a low level of dielectric separation, below an acceptable level. This is avoided in the form as in Figures 15 to 19. A further feature is that with the rear rib 37 being integral with the back 18, protection is provided, to the cut ends of the conductors, from any moisture getting down between the back of the cap and the back of the body. Also seen in Figures 18 and 19 is a modification to the bottom of the body. Ribs or rails 50 and 51 are provided at each edge of the bottom surface 52 of the body 10. In the example an outer rib 50 extends along the front and back edges and a second rib 51 extends parallel to each rib 50. Ribs 51 define a channel into which a tap can be positioned Along the center line there are two sets of protrusions, a pair of circular protrusions 52 and an elongate protrusion 53. The tape has apertures through which the protrusions 52 and 53 pass.Protrusions 52 act as rivets in that the outer ends are deformed and enlarged over the tape to hold the body over the taps. The center protrusion acts as a pressure member for the pliers or other mechanism for squeezing cap and body into a complete installation. The connector bodies are attached to the tape, and conveniently automatic insertion of terminals and positioning of the cap can be carried out. The cap will be in the first stage of assembly to the body. The connectors on a tape can be fed through a tool which makes the final crimp or assc s bly after insertion of the conductors, followed by removal of the connector from the tape. An alternative is to attach the bodies to a tape by an adhesive, for example, but the protrusions and apertures ensure a specific spacing, important if automated preassembly is desired. Figures 20 to 25 illustrate in more detail one form of cap 11, which is common to the bodies, 10 and 15. The cap is also of hollow, box like, form, haVing front wall 50, side walls 51 and back wall 52, all depending from a top web 53. In the example illustrated, the front wall has four slots 54 extending from a bottom edge up towards the top web 53. These slots 54 define three ribs 55 and at the top of each slot, extending laterally from the ribs 55 and the exposed edges 56 of the front wall 50, are small protrusions 57. On each side wall 51 there are two sets of protrusions.Near the lower edge 60 there is a single protrusion in the form of a tapered rib 61. Closer to the top web are two spaced protrusions 62, in the form of elongate ribs. The back wall 52 has a large recess or groove 63 extending from a bottom edge up towards the top web, as seen in Figure 25 most clearly. The width of the recess or groove 63 is slightly greater than the dimension between the opposed edges 55 in the front wall 50 and the depth of the groove 63 is about the same as the depths of the slots 54. On the inside of the ribs 55 are short ribs 64, as seen inFigures 20, 22 and 24. These ribs are spaced and shaped so as to cooperate with the chamfers 31 on the rib 22 in the body 10 as in Figures 3 to 8. Thus the opposed surfaces 72 slide down in contact with the chamfers 31 on assembly of cap to body. Extending laterally on the inner surface of the top web 53 are two ribs 65, spaced a short distance from the front and back walls. A further two ribs 67 are positioned between ribs 65 and three channels 68, 69 and 70 are thereby defined. The channels 68, 69 and 70 are interconnected at one end by a groove 71. Figures 26 to 30 illustrate an alternative form of cap 11, which can also be common to the bodies 10 and 15. The cap of Figures to 26 30 is very similar to that of Figures 20 to 25, and similar references are used where applicable. The cap is of hollow, box like form, with front wall 50, side walls 51 and back wall 52, all depending from a top web 53. However, while in the form of cap illustrated in Figures 20 to 25, there are slots 54 defining ribs 55, in the front wall, in the example of Figures 26 to 30, the front wall 50 is of reduced height, effectively forming one aperture extending the width of the cap, instead of a plurality of apertures, as represented by the slots 54 in the cap of Figures 20 to 25. The back wall 52 is of reduced height, in the same manner as the front wall 50. As in the cap of Figures 20 to 25, on each side wall 51 there are two sets of protrusions. Near the lower edge 60 there is a single protrusion in the form of a tapered rib 61. Closer to the top web are two spaced protrusions 62, in the form of elongate ribs. Extending laterally on the inner surface of the top web 53 are two ribs 65 spaced a short distance in from the back and front walls. A further rib 72 is positioned between the sides 65, to define two channels 68 and 69. The channels 68 and 69 are interconnected at each end by grooves 71. The center rib 72 has a slot or channel 73 at its center, and short slots 74 at each end. Before considering the assembly of a body and cap, it is convenient to consider the terminals for use in the connector.Figures 31 and 32 illustrate one form of insulation displacing terminal 12 suitable for use with a connector as illustrated inFigure 1. Two terminals 12 form a pair, referenced as 13, corresponding to one of the pairs in Figure 1. The terminals each comprise two opposed cantilevered beams or legs 80 extending from a base 81. Each leg has its outer surface extending first upward and inward from the base and then upward and outward, forming a neck at the conjuction. These terminals are more fully described in application Serial No 355,309 filed July 3, 1980. At the lower edge of each end of the base a triangular portion 82 is bent out of the plane of the base, to form a sprag.For a connector as in Figure 1, a pair of terminals is inserted into each channel 68, 69 in the cap 11. One pair is inserted with an end face of the base against one side wall and the other pair is inserted with the end face at the other end in contact with the other side wall. This is indicated in dotted outline in Figure 1. The caps, and the bodies, are molded of a plastic material, and on insertion of the terminal pairs in a cap, the sprags 82 dig into the plastic and retain the terminals in the channels 68, 69. Figures 33, 34 and 35 illustrate an alternate form of terminal arrangement for the connector of Figure 2. Four terminals 32 are in one strip, the terminals basically of the same form as in Figures 21 and 22. The strip is bent into a U shape with two parallel spaced apart legs 83 and 84. The strip is bent such that the terminals 12 in one leg are offset laterally relative to the terminals 12 in the other leg, as seen in Figures 33 and 34. The lower corners at each end again have triangular portions bent out to form sprags 82. The legs 83 and 84 are joined by the intermediate portion of the base, identified at 85. For a connector as in Figure 2, a terminal arrangement as in Figures 33, 34 and 35 is inserted into a cap 11. The legs 83 and 84 go into the channels 68 and 69 and the portion 85 goes into a groove 71.The terminals are retained in position by the sprags 82. Assuming that terminals have been pre assembled to a cap, the terminals either of the form as illustrated in Figures 31 and 32 or 33, 34 and 35, or of some other form, the cap is assembled to the body in two stages. For supplying to users, the body and cap, with inserted terminals, are pushed together so that the cap enters the body, open end first. The tapered ribs 51 are pushed past the ribs 29 in the body, the ribs 29 residing between the tapered ribs 51 and the elongate ribs 52. This holds the cap and body together but in an open or non connecting condition. In this condition conductors can be inserted through the apertures 20. Considering a connector as in Figure 1 first, for a typical connection, four insulated conductors are inserted, a Tip and Ring of a first pair and a Tip and Ring of a second pair. The Tip and Ring conductors alternate, that is the Tip conductors have a Ring conductor between. The unstripped, i.e. insulated, conductors pass separately and individually through the apertures 20 and the apertures 25 until the ends of the conductors touch the back 18 of the body. The conductors traverse the channels 26 and 27, or slots 42 45, depending on the body form. The contact between conductor ends and the back 18 gives a definitive positioning of the conductors in the connector. The cap is then pushed fully into the body as by a tool such as a parallel movement pliers. As the cap is pushed in the terminals 12 displace the insulation of the conductors and make contact with the metal conductor core, the terminals being guided in the channels 26 or slots 42 45. For a normal butt connection the terminals in one channel 26, or slots 42 and 43, connect one pair of conductors, for example the two Ring conductors, and the terminals in the other channel 26, or slots 44 and 45 connect the other pair of conductors, i.e. the Tip conductors. If desired, only two conductors can be connected, by inserting the conductors in two of the apertures 20 spaced by one aperture 20. When fully inserted, the elongate ribs 52 extend below the ribs 29 on the body.Generally it is arranged that the cap is flush with the body when fully and correctly installed or crimped thus giving an indication of correct installation. The separators 28, in the example of Figures 3 to 8, prevent dielectric breakdown between the ends of adjacent conductors.Additional protection against dielectric breakdown, between two terminal pairs, can be obtained by forming a rib or protrusion on the top surface of rib 23 in the body, indicated in dotted outline at 38 in Figures 3 and 6. This protrusion fits into the channel 70, Figures 20 and 24. For a connector of the type as in Figure 2, it depends on whether a bridge or tap connection is required. For a bridge three conductors are inserted in three of the apertures 20, passing through the apertures 25. The cap is then fully inserted and the terminals displace the insulation and make contact. As the terminal arrangement is as inFigures 33, 34 and 35, all three conductors are interconnected. These will be all Ring or all Tip conductors, for a telephone use. Generally two connectors would be used, one for Tip conductors and one for Ring conductors. For a tap connection, the continuous conductor is inserted into the body through the slot 30 in the side of the body. The conductor snaps through the slot 30 into the aperture 25 and the body is thus retained on the conductor. With the cap in the initial assembly condition this slot is still open. The continuous conductor finishes up extending through the end apertures 20 and 25 at the related side. One or more conductors are then inserted through apertures 20 and 25 and the cap pushed fully in. The terminals displace the insulation and make contact.Again, as the terminal arrangement is as in Figures 33, 34 and 35, all the conductors are interconnected. For telephone use one connector would be used for Tip conductors and another connector for Ring conductors. As the cap is pushed fully in, with the elongate ribs 52 engaging under the ribs 29, the side wall 41 of the cap at the side of the groove or slot 30 closes off this slot. Normally a predetermined amount of a sealing compound is injected into the body prior to the pre assembly of the body and cap.This compound completely fills the cavity inside the connector and extends into the apertures 20 around the conductors, when the connectors are finally installed or crimped. A pumping action which occurs when the cap and body are fully installed or crimped, forces the compound into the various gaps and clearances around the conductors, including into the various orifices in the body and gaps between the body and cooperating surfaces of the cap. It is advantageous to provide test ports, either in the body or the cap. Test ports in the body are seen in detail in Figures 15 and 17. The test ports, indicated at 90, are provided in the bottom web of the body. The test ports are aligned with the terminals in the cap and enable electrical test connections, via probes. In the example illustrated in Figures 15 and 17, the terminals would be extended, as shown in dotted outline at 87 in Figures 31 and 32, to enable contact to be made. In the example illustrated in Figures 15 and 17, the ports are rectangular, and as seen in Figure 17, have inwardly directed flaps 91.The flaps 91 serve two purposes. Firstly they prevent, or at least considerably reduce, the issue of grease through the ports when the connector is finally crimped or assembled. Also, when a probe is pushed in, the flaps deflect slightly and wipe grease off the probe when the probe is withdrawn, retaining it in the connector. One particular form of probe end 92 for use with ports 90 is illustrated in Figures 36 a and b . The probe end is generally oblong in cross section, slightly narrower than the length of the port and slightly thinner than the width of the port but slightly thicker than the width of the gap between the flaps 91. Other forms of ports, and probes, can be used. Ports can also be provided in the cap as indicated in dotted outline at 93 in Figure 1.Ports 90 are also indicated in the body 15 in Figure 9. While the provision of test ports is not essential, it is preferred. The ability to test by inserting probes through a port is a considerable advantage as compared with a contempary system in which sharply pointed probes are used to pierce the insulation of the conductors external to the connector. This leaves a permanent perforation in the insulation, with possible ingress of moisture.The test ports can also be used with connectors not filled with grease. In some instances, only a test port is required. The present connector has many advantages over existing connectors. In effect a family of connectors is provided which are suitable, or adaptable, to various types of connection, or interconnection, with various forms of conductors. For convenience, it is desirable to keep the number of different parts to a minimum, both for cost and for minimum stock. As described previously there are various forms of body and cap, which can be provided both with and.without test ports. One advantage is that the conductors, in making connections for telephone systems, are inserted as pairs, for a butt connection. Thus, a first pair of conductors, comprising a Tip conductor and a Ring conductor, is inserted in adjacent apertures 20. Then the second pair of conductors is inserted. In many forms of known connectors, it is necessary for the installer or repairer to separate pairs of conductors, match the two Tip conductors together and insert them into a connector, make the connection, then match up the two Ring conductors, insert into a connector and make the connection. As often a very large number of connections are being made at one time even slight reductions in time and improvements in ease of insertion and assembly represent substantial overall gains and improvements, in time and costs.Also, convenience of application of connectors also assists in obtaining improved quality of connection. As described above, depending upon the type of connection to be made, not all of the apertures 20, 25, will be used. Thus, in the cap 11, not all of the slots 54 will be used. In the example of a connector with a body as in Figures 3 to 8 or 9 to 14, with a cap as in Figures 20 to 25, lateral, or sideways, distortion of a rib 55, from a slot occupied by a conductor towards a slot unoccupied by a conductor, is prevented as the ribs 54 are in engagement with the chamfers 31. Thus the alignment of the ribs 55, which provide strain relief, is maintained. This effect is also obtained if two conductors of different diameters occupy adjacent apertures 20, 25.Thus the connector will accept and efficiently connect two, three, or four conductor, and also accept and connect conductors of differing sizes, an advantage over other connectors. However, in extremely low temperatures, the flow of grease into the apertures 20 and 25, around tile conductors can be restricted by the ribs 64, and a cap of the form of Figures 26 to 30, can be used. The cap of the form ofFigures 26 to 30 can also be used at other than low temperatures. The connector has, in effect, a two stage assembly or installation. There is an initial stage in which the particular terminal arrangement is in position in the cap and the cap is assembled to the body to a first position, the tapered ribs 51 beyond the ribs 29. The sealing compound, if used, is injected, with the body, usually before such initial stage. The connectors can be packaged for storage. The second stage occurs when conductors have been inserted and the body and cap then pushed or crimped completely together. The connector is small and compact. In many instances only one connector is required instead of two. Particularly in telecommunications, where large number of connectors are used to connect conductors of cables, improved ease of connection, reduction in connection time, reduction in the number of connectors and minimal size are all very important factors. Conveniently, the body can be molded of a translucent or opaque material and the cap of a coloured material. A proper, fully inserted assembly or crimp can be ascertained as when surfaces of the coloured part move into contact with the translucent part, the coloured part becomes very visible on a proper crimp. The presence of a sealing compound enhances this effect. Figure 37 a , b and c illustrate very diagrammatically the various types of connections which can be made, and particularly exemplified by telephone conductors. In Figure 37 a , two butt connections are made, between two Tip conductors 95 and 96 and between two Ring conductors 97 and 98. In Figure 37 b , a bridge connection is made between three conductors 99, 100 and 101.For telephones, if these are Tip conductors, then another bridge connection is made for Ring conductors 102, 103 and 104. In Figure 37 c , a tap is made to a continuous Tip conductor 105, with one or two conductors 106 and 107 and a further tap to a continuous Ring conductor 108 by one of two conductors 109 and 110. The conductors are not necessarily shown in the actual positions as assumed in the connector, but are illustrative only. While the connector has been described with the cap being inserted into the body, it will be appreciated that only minor modifications need be made to reverse this and have the body inserted into the cap. The main changes are in the ribs 29, 51 and 52, ribs 51 and 52 being put on the outside of the body and ribs 29 on the inside of the cap. Also, the form and arrangement of the ribs 29, 51 and 52, can be varied, the object being the two stage assembly. It will also be appreciated that the basic geometry or structure of the body and cap can be modified to accept more than four wires. Also more than two pairs of terminals can be provided but the connector then becomes larger and more complex.
