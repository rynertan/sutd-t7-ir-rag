# Limited angle electric rotary actuator.

## Abstract
An electric rotary actuator for producing rotation through a limited angle comprises a rotor winding 30 made of a plurality of thin loop coils 31 arranged in a continuous cylindrical framework as part of a rotor shell. The rotor shell lies in an annular flux gap defined by stator magnet assembly 13 and a flux return means. Each pair of adjacent axially extending limbs of adjacent loop coils lies opposite to and cooperates with a respective stator pole face. This winding arrangement helps to optimise the torsional resonance characteristics of the rotating mass.
