# Inflatable raft having continuous gas cell formed from single sheet.

## Abstract
A flexible, rectangular, impermeable sheet of rubberized cloth is formed into an elongated, continuous, linear tube, which is then joined end to end to produce a continuous circular gas cell 14 for a raft. The cell is bent at several corners into a polygonal configuration, and angulation members 26 are attached to the corners to retain the bends and preserve the desired cell shape upon inflation. A bottom sheet 42 is attached to the polygonal cell 14 to complete the raft.

## Description
Inflatable raft having continuous gas cell formed from single sheetField of the Invention This invention relates to an inflatable raft made of rubberized cloth or the like, and which may be stored on sh O5 or airplanes for rescue use in an emergency, or which may a used for recreational purposes.Description of the Prior Art Conventional inflatable rafts are polygonal, circular and elliptical in shape. An example of a polygonal raft is illus trated in Figs. 1 through 3, wherein Fig. 1 shows a perspec ive view of a continuous gas cell pf.the raft, Pig .2 shows a hori zontal section taken on line A A of Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 shos a flat blank from which a single gas cell is made. The polygonal gas cell 1 is made of impermeable sheets of rubberized cloth which are formed into tubular units and adhesive connected to each other. In manufacturing the gas cell, sheets la, Ib, lc, etc.with S curved edges at both ends are cut out on a floor surface such that each sheet is offset by a certain length from an adjacent sheet, and has an overlapping edge margin for adhesion.The sheets are then coated with adhesive at the margins, and formed into tubular units. A predetermined number of such units, two for example, are connected together at their ends as shown in Fig. 2, and the connected units are then similarly joined with other connected units to eventually arrive at the. final gas cell configuration shown in Fig. 1. The manufacture of this conventional raft thus necessitates connecting a plurality of gas cell units.tosethers an operation which inevitably requires specialized manual skills the sequence is very difficult and the reliability of the completed is generally poor. The complex shapes of the various gas cell blanks make the work very tedious, and since it is carried out on the floor level the workers must be constantly bent over. Finally, the large quantity of adhesives involved contain dangerous and harmful substances, which have harmful effects on the operators health. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides an inflatable raft which can be constructed in a short time and which eliminates the troublesome operation of adhering together a plurality of separate sections. A single, elongated continuous tubular gas cell is formed from a rectangular sheet, and is then bent into a polygonal shape and secured by simple angulation members at the corners. The efficiency of the angulation assembly operation is increased in one embodiment by using a pair of patches fixed to the walls of the gas cell and adjoining member connected at its ends between the patches the joining member can also be used as a handle. The rafts can be made easily without requiring special assembly skills by simply connecting one end of the tubular gas cell to the other end to form a continuous circular cell, and then, in another embodiment, inserting angulation members with projecting tabs into predetermined corner portions of the cell to bend it into a polygonal shape. In another embodiment a projection on the angulation members supports a grab or safety rope extending around the inside of the raft.

DETAItED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In Figs. 4 and 5 a cont inuous gas cell 1 is in the form of a hollow polygonal tube made of a honpermeable sheet material Flexible patches 2 are fixed to the outer wall of the gas cell on the inner side of the tube. A joining member 3 is connected between adjacent patches2 to draw them towards each other to . thereby angulate the gas cell 1. A pair of patches 2 and a joining member 3 constitute an angulation member. In the production of the raft a flexible and impermeable sheet, such as rubber or resin coated cloth, is cut into an elongated belt like strip of sufficient length to form the polygonal gas cell 1 and sufficient width to allow an overlapping margin for an adhesive tube joint at the wedge of the rectangular strip. One longitudinal edge of the strip is joined to the other longitudinal edge to form an elongated linear tube, and subsequently one end of the tube is joined to the other end to form a continuous circular tube. A joining member 3 made of a synthetic cloth, a belt or the like is connected to a pair of adjacent patches 2 by sewing at both ends to form an angulation member. The patches are made of rubber cloth or the like, and may be round, elliptical or quadrilateral in shape. The angulati on members are adhered to the inside wall 1A of the raft such that they traverse the angles of the bent portions of then gas cell 1, and thus tension the cell to form corners and thereby define 9 polygonal gas cell. A bottom sheet 4 and other additional devices may be attached to the cell to make up a complete raft. The raft is usually folded for storage in a suitable place, and is inflated by gas in cases of emergency or as desired when the raft is to be used recreationally. The ang√ªlation members.are not restricted to those des cribed above, with various other.configurations being adoptable. In Fig, 6A a joining member 31 made of a synthetic cloth, √† belt or the like, has one end sewn to a patch 21. The complete angulation member is thus composed of two sets of joining members 31 and patches 21, and is applied by adhering each half at a predetermined position on the gas cell 11 and then drawing to gether and connecting the free ends of the joining members by sewing, gluing or tying to form a suitable angle in the gas cell 11. In In Fig. 6B the patches 22, 22 are each provided with a plurality of holes with eyelets. A cord or cords 32 are stretched across the gap betw een the patches 22 and drawn tight to give the gas cell a suitable angle. The patches may be fixed to the gas cell either manually or automatically, using a pressure fixing machine, in accordance with the wishes and requirements of the manufacturer. In the embodinents shown in Figs. 4 through 6B the joining members of the angulation members are spaced from the wall of the gas cell. This is very convenient as, accordingly, they can be utilized as handles for carrying the raft, or when actually riding in it. In Figs. 7A and 7B the gas cell 12 is tucked inwardly at the angled corner portions 12a. The patch like angulation member 23 shown in Fig. 7A is adhered to the bent corner portion with its interior surface directly affixed to and covering the portion 12a to angulate the gas cell 12 at a number of positions 12b to form a polygonal shape. The gas cell 12 it Fig. 7B has two vertically arranged chambers. There is no substantial difference in the a,ng,ulation , members of the two independent chambers, although obviously the corner bends must be vertically aligned to prevent distortions in the inflated raft. It is preferable that the tucked portions 12a be smeared with adhesive to stick the folded layers together in order to reliably maintain the connection and angulation. The tucks shown in Figs. 7A and 7B prevent the outside wall of the gas cell from being excessively stretched when inflated. Accordingly, the tensions in the inside and outside wall of the gas cell when,inflated are substantially uniform, enabling the raft.to withstand iong term use. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 8 the angulation member 24 has a projecting portion 24a which is inserted into the folded tuck portion 13a and adhesively adhered thereto to provide a rigid and inseparable connection . In In Figs. 9 through 11B, various other modifications of the angulation member are shown, each of them being employed in the insertion manner shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 9 the angulation member is made of a flexible material which is folded into a T shape having a planar portion 241a and √Öa projecting insertion tab 241. The contact ing surfaces proximate the central fold line are sewn together at 242. .In Fig. 10 the flexible angulation member is folded into a T shape in the same manner as shown in Fig. 9 to define an insertion tab 243, and a flexible patch 244 is adhered to the plantar portion thereof. In Fig. llA the angulation member 245 is molded of plastic as a single, integral, flexible unit, which is ideally suited for mass production. In Fig. llB the planar portion 25 is given a curvature to provide an untensioned, snug fit against the wall of the inflated gas cell, and to enable its easy adhesive attachment. In Figs. 12 and 13 the gas cell 14 has angulation members 26 each having a first projection 26a which is inserted into a corner tuck and an apertured, outwardly extending projection 26b through which a grab rope 40 is threaded. A plug 41 prevents the inflation gas, such as C02, from leaking out of the gas chamber, and a bottom sheet 42 is adhesively attached to the bottom of the gas cell 14. Since the angulation members are also used to support the grab rope, separate attachments therefor are not needed. This reduces the number of parts needed to assemble a complete raft, and thereby lowers the production time and cost. The rafts of this invention are usually folded for storage when not in use, and it is therefore important that the angula tion members be flexible. If they are rigid they will obstruct the folding of the rafts and cause unwanted frictional wear and rubbing of the raft tube material. A synthetic rubber adhesive which hardens at normal room temperatures may be used to form the gas cells, and to fix the angulation and other members thereto. Alternatively, an epoxy or a phenolic adhesive which is hardened by heating may be used, as well as a hot melt type adhesive such as an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. ,.
