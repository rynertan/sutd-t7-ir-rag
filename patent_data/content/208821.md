## Description
The present invention concerns a floating plaything in the shape of an animal, pedal operated, for the fun of children, at the sea or at the lakes. It is already well known that pattini or oar boats are too heavy and not given to children and youngsters main ly for safety reasons. It is the aim of the present invention to realize a nice floating means, easy to be handled, also for small child ren, safe and cheap. The aim is reached by a floating means consisting in a glassfiber structure, inflatable rubberized canvas or o ther suitable material, having the shape of a fish or an aquatic bird, and provided with a housing for the occu pant with a maneuver rudder control, a pedal pushing e lement acting on two overlapping sponsons, placed below the bottom, and a device from fan spraying and or orien tating the spray of the water taken by a small hand pump. The present invention will be described more in detail in the following, according to the drawings showing two preferred embodiments. Referring to the details of the figures, 1 shows the fish shaped hull and 2 the bird shaped hull, 3 shows the housing for seat 4, 5 shows the helm of rudder 6, said helm consisting in the lower portion of the end tail of the animal shaped structure and controlled by means of the continuous cable 7, with a pedal 8 pushing element directly acting onto lower propeller sponsons 9, provid ed with a stop hinge 10. For what concerns the water stability of the floating means, the present invention provides that the animal shaped structure be horizontally devided in two chambers upper chamber 11 being sealed and with floating functions, and lower chamber 12, with small entry doors 13, that may be ballasted with sand, water or other material so as to lower the barycenter of the floating means thus preventing the same from upsetting. For the fun of the occupant, a small hand pump 14 is provided for spraying, from the outlet hole, a water spray that may be manually directed, eventually on o ther playing children. The functioning of the object according to the present invention is evident through doors 13, lower chamber 12 is ballasted with sand, the floating means is pushed into the water and pushing pedals 8 the sponsons are vertically placed onto hinge 10 for acting onto the wa ter and determine the advancing while, frontwardly push ed, they overlap onto hinge 10 until they are horizontal ly placed and will not offer any friction to the water in the meantime, the sliding of cable 7 is determined rotating helm 5 and the lateral placing of rudder 6 for the direction. It is evident that sticking to the main principle of the present invention, the animal shapes of the hull may be of any fish or bird, like cod fish, dolfish, whale, sea gull, swan or similar, and the materials and dimen sions may be varied without leaving the limits of the present invention.
