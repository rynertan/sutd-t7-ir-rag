# A process for producing an ambient stable, starch containing concentrate.

## Abstract
A process for producing an aqueous concentrate which can be pasteurized and subsequently reconstituted into a lump free, thick soup, sauce, gravy or dessert, which pro cess involves producing a concentrate in which are in corporated i a proportion of starch sufficient to obtain a product of the desired degree of creaminess, ii a proportion of an appropriate osmotic pressure increasing agent sufficient to substantially reduce the rate of swelling of starch granules and prevent gelatinisation of said starch during pasteurization, and iii a proportion of a water activity depressing agent conducive to a water activity not exceeding 0.92.
