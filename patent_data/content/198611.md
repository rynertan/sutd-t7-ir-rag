## Description
This invention relates to strand material and, more particularly, to twisting together at least two strands advancing continuously from a source of strands. Prior art stranding machines usually include reels of strand material whirling about horizontal or vertical axes. Such machines have large space requirements and need extensive guards and shields to protect operators from the whirling mass. The present invention is intended to provide a simplified apparatus and method for continuously twisting together a plurality of strands into a rope or cable. By the apparatus and method of the present invention, strands may be twisted into a rope as individual strands advance continuously from a source such as an extruder or supply reel. There is no requirement to rotate one strand source about the other instead, the strand sources remain secured to a fixed support and merely pay out in a continuous, generally parallel fashion. The present invention, in one respect, provides a method of winding together at least two strands 44,46 comprising the steps of The present invention provides a conveyor means 11 for simultaneously advancing and twisting a plurality of strands 44,46 into a rope, the conveyor means 11 comprising an elongate trough having at least two walls arranged to define a linear path, a first wall of said at least two walls including a plurality of generally parallel rollers 34 , the rotational axes of which rollers 34 are oriented at a predetermined angle to horizontal and vertical planes in which the conveyor means 11 is disposed power means M,M for driving said rollers in unison in a predetermined direction and means 47 for feeding said strands into said trough and into frictional contact with said rollers 34 , said rollers 34 being effective, by virtue of their predetermined angular position and the predetermined direction of rotation, to advance the strands 44,46 while twisting the strands 44,46 into a rope. The conveyor means is in the form of a trough and acts to twist and advance a plurality of strands along a substantially linear path. The trough has at least one side wall formed with a series of aligned parallel rollers and each roller has a rotational axis disposed at a predetermined angle relative to horizontal and vertical planes in which the conveyor means is disposed. The power means are provided for rotating the rollers in unison in a predetermined direction so that a plurality of advancing strands in frictional contact with said rollers are influenced by at least two components of force, a first force component tending to continue the advance of the strands, and a second force component tending to rotate twist or wind the strands into a rope. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a conveyor means according to the present invention Figure 2 is a side elevation of the conveyor means of Figure 1 on the line 2 2 Figure 3 is a sectional view along the staggered line 3 3 in Figure 1 observed in the direction of the arrows Figure 4 shows a second conveyor means in tandem with the conveyor means of Figure 1 Figure 5 is a view, similar to Figure 2, with portions broken away to reveal a pressure foot and Figure 6 is a sectional view, similar to Figure 3, showing three strands twisting and advancing in the second conveyor means. In Figures 1, 2 and 3, the reference numeral 11 generally designates a conveyor means including two pairs of rails defining bearing blocks or bearing supports. A first pair of bearing supports 12, 13 are, on one side, spaced apart by, and secured to, a series of side or cover plates 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 and by plates 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 on the opposite side. A second pair of bearing supports 19, 20 are, on one side, spaced apart by, and secured to, a corresponding series of side or cover plates 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and by plates 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 on the opposite side. The side plates and, in turn, the bearing blocks are supported by legs 26, 27 secured to flat plates 28, 29 respectively. Bearing supports 19, 20 are constructed in the same fashion and for the same purpose as are the supports 12, 13. Therefore, only bearing supports 12, 13 will be described in detail with the understanding that a detailed description of one set of supports also describes the other set. Bearing supports 12, 13 are fitted with a plurality of bushings or sleeves 31, 32 providing spaced bearings for shafts or spindles 33 in turn, supporting mating rollers 34. Suitably keyed to each spindle 33 are spaced sprockets 36, 37. The sprockets 36 of one spindle are aligned with the sprockets 37 of the next adjacent spindle so that roller chains 38 make a driving connection from spindle to spindle when the chains are powered by main spindle S. Main spindle 5 is driven by motor M which is supported by angle bracket 39 in turn secured to leg 26. It is not intended that the means for driving the spindles be limited to sprocket and chain arrangements. Other suitable drives, such as V belts and friction pulleys may be employed as engineering and economic considerations dictate. The rollers 34 and rollers 35, arranged side by side in generally parallel fashion, are formed at one end with a roughened or knurled peripheral surface 40 for a purpose which will become more apparent below. The rollers 34 are each skewed so that their respective rotational axes subtend a predetermined angle relative to horizontal and vertical planes. For the purposes of explaining the present invention the rotational axes develop an included angle alpha,α , with a horizontal plane and an included angle beta,β , with a vertical plane as shown in Figure 3. While, in the preferred embodiment described here the values of alpha and beta are 45 and 45 respectively, it is not intended that the invention be limited to such values. Considerations of desired pitch and included angle of the V shaped cross section require adjustment in these angles from time to time. The skewed rollers 34, 35 having knurled ends 40 are spaced apart slightly as shown in Figure 3 . The rollers form the side walls of the conveyor means 11 and present a trough of generally V shaped configuration in cross section. The apex or bottom of the V defines a generally linear path P. Each set of rollers is driven rotated by respective motors M and M in a direction which is indicated by arcuate arrows 41, 42 in Figure 1. Rotation of the rollers in a given direction, in combination with the skewed disposition of their axes of rotation, is effective to develop two components of force influencing an elongate article not shown cradled in the trough of the conveyor means. Thus, rotating the rollers 34 in the direction of arrow 41 develops two force components. One component is effective to move said elongate article through the conveyor and the second component is effective to rotate the article as it moves forward along path P. Thus, it can be seen that the conveyor means of the present invention is operative and effective continuously to twist and advance a plurality of strands into a rope. Moreover, it is to be appreciated that a plurality of generally parallel strands advancing into the left hand end of the conveyor means of Figure 1 at an appropriate linear speed while the rollers 34 are being rotated by motor M will continue to advance in the conveyor means while the strands are twisted rotated into a rope of a uniform lay and pitch. In fact, while the side walls of the disclosed conveyor means 11 comprise two sets of driven rollers 34 and 35, it is entirely within the scope of the method and apparatus of the present invention to permit one set of rollers to idle. In such an embodiment only one set of rollers is driven but this is sufficient to twist and advance strands effectively. Alternatively, all rollers on one side may be idlers with a pattern or mixture of idlers and driven rollers on the other side as engineering and product considerations dictate. Furthermore, one set of rollers may be replaced by a smooth, relatively friction free, plate of plastic or metallic sheet material so that the side walls comprise one set of driven rollers and a smooth sheet. The walls cooperate to generate a V shaped configuration in cross section. Referring to Figures 4, 5 and 6, a conveyor means 43 is shown receiving two generally parallel strands 44 and 46, emerging in this case from the crosshead 47 of an extruder not shown . The strands are twisted and advanced with a left hand lay at a pitch of approximately 3 5 32 inches 80.2mm . The output of the conveyor means 43 is fed into a similar, tandem, conveyor means 48 at whose upstream end a third strand 49 is introduced from crosshead 51. Operation of tandem conveyor means 48 is effective to combine and twist the third strand 49 into the rope emerging from the downstream end of conveyor means 43 to develop a three strand line, as is apparent in the cross section of Figure 6. Obviously, a number of conveyor means can be arranged in series, each receiving one or more strands to generate a multi strand rope. It is anticipated that the strand material can take a variety of forms such as dough like filaments such as candy, gum or other food products plastic strands, insulated wire, or other ribbons or filamentary lengths of material. Frequently it is necessary to increase friction between the strand material and the rollers. One method of increasing friction is to provide a roughened or knurled surface on the rollers, as at 40 Figure 1 or to utilize a pressure device or a pressure foot, as indicated by the reference numeral 52 in Figure 5. Such a device is resilient, adjustable and usually spring loaded to bear upon the twisting strand to regulate friction between the strands and the rollers.
