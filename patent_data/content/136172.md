# Rechargeable zinc manganese dioxide cell.

## Abstract
A rechargeable cell comprises a positive electrode formed from a manganese oxide electrode material. The manganese oxide electrode material contains a heavy metal selected from the group comprising lead, bismuth, and mixtures of lead and bismuth. The cell also contains a negative electrode of zinc. A separator is provided between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. An alkaline electrolyte consisting essen tially of an alcohol and an alkaline hydroxide is also contained in the rechargeable cell in contact with both the positive electrode and the negative electrode.
