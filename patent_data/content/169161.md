# Polymer bound Fischer Tropsch catalysts.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a resin metal complex catalyst, a method for its preparation, activation and use in carrying out Fischer Tropsch reactions. The complex is a resin which has attached to it a coordination compound s and a metal s . The complex has utility as a Fischer Tropsch catalyst. More specifically, the complex is useful for the gaseous conver sion of synthesis gas carbon monoxide and hydrogen to hydrocarbons.
