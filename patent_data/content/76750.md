# ACTUATOR

## Abstract
An actuator of the screw nut type for converting a rotary input movement into a rectilinear output movement between two fixed end positions According to this invention, the rotary input movement is transmitted to the screw shaft 176 through a linkage comprising a clutch mechanism 206 and a torsion bar 214 , the two clutch elements 208, 210 being frictionally engaged under the force of an axial compression spring 212 , and cam means 268, 274 being further provided for expanding the spring and thus disengaging the clutch elements when the torsion of bar 214 reaches a predetermined amount For use particularly in jet aircraft thrust reversers.
