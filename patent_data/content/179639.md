## Abstract
The present invention provides a multilayer plastics structure characterised by a laminate of at least one layer of a high gas barrier polymer and at least one layer of a blend of at least one propylene based polymer and at least one linear low density polyethylene wherein the total amount of the linear low density polyethylene is equal to or less than about 30 percent by weight of the blend. Such structures may be formed into containers.
