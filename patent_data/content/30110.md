## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AN OXYGENATED HYDROCARBON PRODUCT CONTAINING ETHANOL. The present invention relates generally to a process for the production of an oxygenated hydrocarbon product containing ethanol.In particular the invention concerns the production of such an oxygenated hydrocarbon product containing ethanol by contacting a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, hereinafter to be referred to as synthesis gas, with a catalyst comprising a supported mixture of a rhodium component and a zirconium component. Oxygenated hydrocarbons, and in particular C2 oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetic acid, ethanol and acetaldehyde are valuable industrial products. On a commercial scale acetic acid is generally produced either by oxidation of paraffinic hydrocarbon fractions or by carbonylation of methanol ethanol is produced either by fermentation of natural products, e.g. molasses or by hydration of ethylene in the presence of an acid catalyst and acetaldehyde is produced by the Wacker process.The dwindling reserves of crude oil from which many of the above feedstocks are derived and the associated need to utilise fully the remaining natural resources such as coal and the vast amounts of gases, e.g. methane potentially available from the exploitation of North Sea oilfields, has stimulated research into the utilisation of synthesis gas which can readily be obtained not only from crude oil but also from both coal and methane gas. Much of the early work on synthesis gas conversion involved the use as catalysts of the iron group metals, ruthenium and various metal oxide systems. One general disadvantage of such systems is that catalysts which possess acceptable activity generally tend to be unselective i.e. they produce a wide spectrum of products including both hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons having a broad distribution of carbon numbers.This not only complicates the recovery of the desired products but also results in the wastage of reactants to undesirable products. On the other hand those catalysts having acceptable selectivity generally have a low activity thereby necessitating recycle of large quantities of unchanged reactants. In US Application Serial No 541,661 Union Carbide Corp published as a priority document for Netherlands application No 7500916 there is disclosed a process which, it is claimed, overcomes the aforesaid disadvantages of the prior art processes The process for selectively producing C2 oxygenated hydrocarbons involves continuously contacting synthesis gas with a heterogeneous catalyst essentially comprising rhodium metal under reaction conditions correlated so as to favour the formation of a substantial proportion of acetic acid, ethanol and or acetaldehyde.Subsequent patent applications describe the production of ethanol by contacting synthesis gas with a rhodium iron catalyst US Serial No 541,660 published as a priority document for Netherlands application No 7500918 , a rhodium manganese catalyst DT 2628463 , a rhodium molybdenum or rhodium tungsten catalyst USP 4096164 , a rhodium ruthenium catalyst USP 4101450 and a rhodium uranium thorium catalyst USP 4162262 .Our own copending UK application No 79 14253 BP Case No 4776 describes the use of a rhodium chromium catalyst for the production of C1 to C4 oxygenated hydrocarbons from synthesis gas. We have now found that a supported mixture of a rhodium component and a zirconium component is an active catalyst for the selective production of an oxygenated hydrocarbon product containing ethanol. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of an oxygenated hydrocarbon product containing ethanol which process comprises contacting synthesis gas with a catalyst comprising a supported mixture of a rhodium component and a zirconium component under reaction conditions which result in the formation of an oxygenated hydrocarbon product containing ethanol.Synthesis gas in the form of mixtures of the gases carbon monoxide and hydrogen is abundantly available. Methods for preparing synthesis gas are well known in the art and usually involve the partial oxidation of a carbonaceous substance, e.g. coal. Alternatively synthesis gas may be prepared, for example, by the catalytic steam reforming of methane. Although it is preferred to use substantially pure synthesis gas the presence of such impurities as carbon dioxide and nitrogen can be tolerated. On the other hand impurities which have a deleterious effect on the reaction should be avoided. The ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide in the synthesis gas may vary widely.Normally the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide may be in the range from 20 1 to 1 20, preferably from 5 1 to 1 5 and even more preferably from 1 1 to 2 1. Increasing the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide beyond 2 1 generally tends to increase the total rate of reaction but only at the expense of an increase in selectivity to methane. Increasing the molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide also favours the formation of more highly reduced oxygenated products. Thus, as the ratio increases so the formation of ethanol, rather than acetaldehyde or acetic acid, is favoured. Methods for adjusting the molar ratio by the so called shift reaction are well known to those versed in the art. The catalyst comprises a supported mixture of a rhodium component and a zirconium component. A wide variety of support materials may be employed. Suitable support materials include silica, alumina, silica alumina, magnesia, thoria, titania, chromia, zirconia and active carbon, of which silica is preferred. Zeolite molecular sieves and in particular the crystalline zeolites may also be employed.Suitably the support has a relatively high surface area. The support may have a surface area up to 350 square metres per gram BET low temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherm method , preferably in the range 1 to 300 square metres per gram. Whilst the actual form of the rhodium and zirconium components under the reaction conditions is not known with any degree of certainty it is probable that they are either in the oxide form or the metallic form. Under the reducing conditions prevailing it is more likely that the components are in the metallic form. Thus the rhodium and zirconium components may be added in the form of the metals themselves or in the form of metal compounds and may be added concurrently or sequentially. The rhodium and zirconium components may be deposited on the support by any of the techniques commonly used for catalyst preparation.Although it is possible to add particles of the metals to the support it is preferred to use the techniques of impregnation from an organic or inorganic solution, precipitation, coprecipitation or cation exchange.Conveniently the catalyst may be prepared by impregnating the support with a solution or solutions of a rhodium compound and a zirconium compound which compounds may be organic or inorganic compounds.Suitable compounds are the salts of the metals e.g. the halides, particularly the chlorides and nitrates. Following impregnation the catalyst is preferably dried and calcined. The amount of each of the rhodium component and the zirconium component on the support may suitably be in the range of from 0.01 to 25 weight percent, preferably from 0.1 to 10 weight percent, of each metal based on the combined weight of the metals and the support. The catalyst preferably also contains one or more additional metal components, which may be incorporated in a similar manner to the rhodium and zirconium components.Suitable metals include iron, manganese, molybdenum, tungsten, ruthenium, chromium, uranium, thoriwn, palladium and iridium. The, or each, additional component may suitably be present in an amount in ithe range from 0.1 to 25 weight percent based on thecombineweigt.o.f the metals and the support, The support may also be activated by the addition of a suitable metal or non metal component prior to incorporation of the rhodium and zirconium components. Whilst a wide variety of such metals and nonmetals may be added, the alkali metals, thorium, manganese, rhodium, iron, chromium, molybdenum, boron and phosphorus are specific examples of materials which may be used. Any of the known techniques for catalyst preparation hereinafter referred to may be used for addition of the activating material. In the case of a metal activator the support is preferably impregnated with a solution of a compound of the metal, suitably the nitrate or chloride, and is thereafter dried, suitably by evaporation and calcined. The activated support is then in a suitable condition for addition of the rhodium and zirconium components and optionally other metal components. The amount of activator added may suitably be in the range 0.01 to 50 weight percent, preferably from 1 to 25 weight percent, of the activator element based on the combined weight of the activator element and the support. The reaction conditions which result in the formation of an oxygenated hydrocarbon product containing ethanol are suitably a temperature in the range from 150 to 450 C, preferably from 200 to 400 C, and even more preferably from 200 to 300 C. The use of higher temperatures within the aforesaid range tends to increase the co production of methane. Because of the highly exothermic nature of the reaction the temperature requires careful control in order to prevent a runaway methanation, in which methane formation increases with increasing temperature and the resulting exotherm increases the temperature still further. In fixed bed operations, temperature control may be achieved by mixing the catalyst with an inert diluent, thereby ensuring that the exothermic heat is more evenly distributed.In this way the catalyst may be protected and its useful life prolonged. Reaction pressure is suitably in the range from 1 to 700 bars, preferably from 20 to 300 bars. The use of higher pressures within the aforesaid ranges increases the production rate of C2 oxygenated hydrocarbons. An important reaction parameter is the conversion. A low conversion, preferably less than 20 of the carbon monoxide favours the formation of acetic acid, ethanol and or acetaldehyde. A low conversion may suitably be achieved in a continuous process by employing a high space velocity. Suitably the gas hourly space velocity volume of synthetis gas, at STP, per volume of catalyst per hour is greater than 10 per hour Preferably the gas hourly space 4 6 velocity is in tHe range from 10 to 10 per hour. Excessively high space velocities result in an uneconomically low conversion while excessively low space velocities result in a loss of selectivity to desirable products. Although the reaction may be carried out batchwise it is preferably carried out in a continuous manner. The catalyst may be employed in the form of a fixed or a fluidised bed. The desired oxygenated products may be recovered from the effluent from the reaction by various means, such as scrubbing and or distillation. The residual gas which consists mainly of unreacted synthesis gas may be mixed with fresh carbon monoxide and hydrogen to give the required feed ratio and this composite gas then recycled to the reaction.
