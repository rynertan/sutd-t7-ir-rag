# Device for scanning coloured originals.

## Abstract
A document 14 to be read is illuminated by light source 10 d imaged by optics 16 onto a single 19 integrated detector ay made up of several photosensitive linear arrays 20, 22, 26. Each linear detector is read out to provide a line scan of document. The document is then translated across the e, or its image is caused to translate to achieve the same re t, and each linear array is read out again, resulting in raster put scanning of the document. The detector array consists of free or more linear arrays fabricated on the same integrated tector array 19 and located one above the other and hori zontally aligned. Each one of the three arrays 20, 22, 24 is vered with a color filter 21, 23, 25, so that it only sees one co i.e., red, green, or blue . By reading the three arrays out in rallel, all three colors on the document are read simulta neously. The only difference between the three images be es color , is that at any point in time, each one is at a differ ent height on the document. This difference is eliminated by ply remembering which line each image is on and correctly matting the data which reach a printing device or are stored a memory.

## Description
Device for scanning coloured nriSinals The invention relates to a color input device for scanning pictures and other hard copy data, the scanner consisting of three or more linear arrays on one chip. czech array being sensitive to only one color, tne OUtpUt of said scanner being a signal representative of the scanned image. Detector arrays have been knawn for scverzl years to be e tsePuve light sensitive devices for image readout A plurality of such arrays can be used as a color scanner, as, for example, in a color television system. Alternatively, a single area detector array may be used in conjunction with a finely patterned color encoding filter, as is disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,121.244, entitled Solid State Color Imagine Apparatus . This patent, among other things. discusses the use of a complex pattern of color filters superimposed on the detectors to effect the color separation desired. A simpler color scanner for scanning documents is hereinafter described which utilizes a line scan configuration and no finely patterned filter. According to the present invention, a strip of a document to be read is illuminated and imaged onto a single integrated detector array made up of several linear arrays. Each linear detector is read out to provide a line scan of the document. The document is then translated across the line, or its image is caused to translate to achieve the same result and each array is read out again. resulting in rasher input scanning of a documentThe detector array consists of three or more linear arrays fabricated on the same integrated detector array and located one above the otlier and horizontally aligned. Each one of the three arrays is covered with a color filter, so that it only sees one color i9. red. green, or blue , By reading the three arrays out in parallel, all three colors on the document are read simultaneously.The only difference between the three images besides color is that at any point in time, each one, is at a different height on the document This difference is eliminated by simply remembering which line each image is on and correctly formatting the dau which reach a printing device or are stored in a memory. For a more complete understanding of the invention, reference may be had to the following detailed description of the invention in conjunction with the drawings wherein Figure 1 is a schematic representation of one embodiment of the present invention utilizing four linear arrays on the same e detector chip Figure 2 shows a front view of the detectors and color filter depicted in Figure 1.Figure 3 is a schematic representation of another embodiment of the present invention utilizing three or more area arrays in place of the linear arrays shown in Figure 1 andFigure 4 is a layout diagram of a staggered aperture rr,zsk which is suitable for use with the embodiment shown in Figure 3 and described in U. S. Patent Sumber 4,204,230. The principles of the present invention are set forth in Figure 1. A light source 10 shines light on a document 11 or other object to be scanned. The document 14 has a relative movement with respect to the rest of the system in an upward direction. That is, document 14 would be moving up vertically as seen in Figure 1 or the system would have other scan apparatus to move the imaging system down across the document The light would be reflected off document 14 and focused via lens 16 onto a linear array of detectors in an integrated detector array via the color filter 18. Figure 2, shows a front view of the array and the filter. The top filter 21 could be a filter of the type that would pass red light onto detector set 20.Filter 23 could be a filter that would pass blue light onto detectors 22 and filter 25 could be a filter that passes green light onto detectors 24.Filter 27 could have a fourth color filter if desired or could be left open to allow the light to pass through onto detectors 26 for black and white detection or to detect brightness information to allow for more accurate signal enhancement by subsequent circuitry. Alternatively, the number of arrays arranged in this manner could be changed to some other number to add more or less color channels. The light passing through the filter array 18 would impinge upon a CCD charge coupled device array as seen inFigure 3. Thus, in operation, the light 10 is seen to impinge upon document 14. Lens 16 images the document onto the filter array 18 which would pply the colors passed through the filter to the CCD detector array 30, seen in Figure 1. 2, or 3. As can be seen .n Figure 1, by the use of the four fiiters 11, 23, 25. 7 , four separate scan lines are seen on document 14. Thus, for the embodiment shewn in Figure 1, each line would have to be scanned electronically four separate times, one for each array set 20, 22, 24, and 26. Inasmuch as each line is scanned three or four times, subsequent electronics 17 would have to be utilized to store the information for each line and to correlate them so that the red, blue, green, and brightness information can be correlated for each line of data scanned from the document 14. U.S. Patent Number 4,204,230 discloses a system utilizing a two dimensional integrated detector array for use in achieving high resolution raster input scanning. The present invention could easily use such staggered aperture arrays in place of the linear arrays described above and shown in Figure 1, resulting in the array shown in Figure 3, each part of which is covered with the apenure mask shown in Figure 4. The system operation would be identical to that described in the above discussion, with the area arrays acting in conjunction with an external data buffer to provide the same result achieved with linear arrays. This substitution of area arrays for linear arrays is filly described in the above mentioned earlier U. S. PatentThe photodetector array of the present application has been described in conjunction with charge coupled deviee technology. Any technology which presently or in the future allows for fabrication of imaging cells arranged in the manner set forth in the present application may be used.
