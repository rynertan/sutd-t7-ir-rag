# Shingler wheel for sheet feed apparatus and sheet feed apparatus comprising the same.

## Abstract
The shingler wheel 29 according to the invention, for use in a sheet feed apparatus, has fixed, barrel shaped protrusions 30 spaced about its outer surface which are intended to engage the outermost sheet of a stack of paper to be shingled. Wheel 29 is unitarily constructed and its surface which contacts the sheets of paper is made of a material which produces a lower coefficient of friction between the wheel protrusions and the outermost sheet being shingled than the coefficient of friction between the outermost sheet of paper and its adjacent sheet in the stack.
