# Dry toner.

## Abstract
Dry toners for use in electrostatic latent image develop ment comprising a colorant in a resin binder are described, wherein said resin binder comprises a polyester containing COOH groups in which at least one of the COOH groups is replaced with nitrogen containing compounds such as amines, ammonium salts, betaines pyridinium salts, and azines. These toners are superior in development of nega tively charged latent images and exhibit good low tempera ture fixability.
