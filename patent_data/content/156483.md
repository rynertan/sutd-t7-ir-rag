# Process for producing Sm2Co17 alloy suitable for use as permanent magnets.

## Abstract
A process is described for producing an Sm₂Co₁₇ alloy suitable for use as a permanent magnet, the alloy also con taining iron, copper and zirconium or a similar group IVB or VB transition metal, and optionally praseodymium in partial replacement of the samarium. The process comprises pro viding the alloy in a preliminary form, sintering the alloy at an elevated temperature to achieve a high density and high remanence, selecting a solution treatment temperature which is marginally below the solid liquid solid phase transformation temperature of said alloy, cooling the sintered alloy body from the sintering temperature to the solution treatment temperature in a controlled manner to put the alloy constituents into a substantially uniform 2 17 Sm Co solid solution, holding at the solid solution treatment temperature, quenching the alloy to room temperature, reheating the alloy to a first aging temperature to transform the 2 17 Sm Co solid solution into a structure comprising a network of the 1 5 Sm Co phase within a 2 17 Sm Co matrix, cooling the alloy to a second aging temperature in a controlled manner to cause regions of 2 17 Sm Co phase to nucleate coherently within the 1 5 Sm Co phase network and create lattice strain which results in high coercivity and good loop squareness, and cooling the alloy to room temperature.
