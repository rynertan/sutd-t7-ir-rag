# Method of and apparatus for acoustic imaging.

## Abstract
Method and apparatus for imaging objects utilizing acoustic waves at frequences in tlte range 4.2 GHz to 8 GHz wherein a transducer 4 , and an object 6 imaged by waves or beams from the transducer 4 are both at a temperature no greater than 0.2 k. The transducer 4 is driven by pulses generated by a short pulse generator 40 which are stretched and coded by a dispersive filter 44A and inductively coupled to a low temperature coupler to be used to drive the trans ducer. The frequency returns are carried by the same bidi rectional coupler 10 to a low noise amplifier 12 . Both the low noise amplifier 12 , and bidirectional coupler 10 are maintained at a temperature of less than 4.2 k. The output of the amplifier 12 is then coupled to a dispersive filter 44B which responds to the coding in the first dispersive filter 44A , to decode the information and reconstruct the signal. Subsurface defects are detected by heating 80 , the object 6 while it is inspected by the acoustic transducer 4 .
