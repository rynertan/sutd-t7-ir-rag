# Solar cell device incorporating plural constituent solar cells.

## Abstract
A solar cell device comprises a first solar cell 70 to which two other separately fabricated solar cells 72, 73 are bonded by a transparent bonding agent, the other cells 72, 73 being of thin film form. The bonding agent can be an electrical insulator and the cells 70, 72, 73 can be wired independently so as to be current and voltage decoupled. Alternatively, the bonding agent is tin doped indium oxide so that the cells are connected in series. At least the thin solar cells 72, 73 are formed by an epitaxial lateral overgrowth technique.
