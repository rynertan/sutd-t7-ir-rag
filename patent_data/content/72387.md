# Apparatus for dry distillation of discarded rubber tires.

## Abstract
Discarded rubber tires are charged in random state into a vertical dry distillation furnace 1 , and the tires at a lower part thereof are caused to undergo combustion to give off hot combustion gases by which the tires at higher levels undergo dry distillation to produce distillation gases which are useable as fuel. The combustion is started by burners 9 and is then self sustained by supplying only air. The furnace interior at its part 3a below the combustion zone is expanded or flared in the downward direction to an open end immersed in water, but the downward movement of the tires and residue is braked by a self sustained grate effect until the residue finally drops out of the furnace to be removed by a conveyor 13 . The continuous and efficient operation over a long period of this furnace is assisted by a separator 2 also capable of long continuous operation.
