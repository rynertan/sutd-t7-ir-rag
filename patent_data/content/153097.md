# Early high strength concrete composition.

## Abstract
An early high strength concrete composition is formed of a polysialatesiloxo material obtained by adding groundblast furnace slag to a reactant mixture consisting of alumino sili cate oxide Si₂O₅, Al₂O₂ with the aluminum cation in a four fold coordination, strong alkalis such as sodium hydroxide and or potassium hydroxide, water, and a sodium potassium poly silicate solution. The slag may be added in an amount of 15 to 26 parts, by weight, based upon the reactant mixture. Suffi cient hardening for demolding is obtained in about 1 hour with this composition.
