# Catalyst for use in preparation of pyromellitic acid and or pyromellitic anhydride.

## Abstract
A supported catalyst on an inert carrier suitable for the preparation of pyromellitic acid or its anhydride by catalytic vapor phase oxidation of a tetra C₁ C₄ alkylbenzene, said catalyst comprising catalytically active material composed of 1 to 20 parts by weight of V₂O₅, 99 to 80 parts of weight of TiO₂ and or SnO₂ and or ZrO₂, and per one hundred parts by weight of V₂O₅, TiO₂ and or SnO₂ and or ZrO₂, 0.02 to 10 parts by weight, calculated as P₂O₅, of a phosphorus compound, 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, calculated as Nb₂O₅, of a niobium compound, 0 to 1.2 parts by weight, calculated as oxide, of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of potassium, cesium, rubidium and thallium, and 0 to 10 parts by weight, calculated as Sb₂O₃, of an antimony compound, and an inert carrier supporting said catalytically active material thereon.
