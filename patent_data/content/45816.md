## Description
Copolymer of alpha methylstyrone and diene and process for making same. Field of the Invention The invention partains to copolymers of alpha mathylstyxenetype monomers with conjugated diene monomers. In another aspect, the invention partains to processes of copolymerisation of alpha methylstyrene type monomers with conjugated diene monomers. In a further aspect, the invention partains to methods of providing high conversion of alpha methylstyrene type monomers in copolymerisation with conjugated diene monomers. In a still further aspect the invention partains to uncoupled linear copolymers, coupled linear copolymers, and coupled radial copolymers, of alpha methylstyrene tzpy monomers with conjugated duene monomers. Background of the invention Alpha methylstyrene type monomers have been polymerized using solution polymerization procedures employing monofunctional anionic initoators such as the organolithium initiators. Polar additivas have been emplozed to improve the rate of polymerisation of such as alpha methylstyrene. Subsequently, butadiene has been added to form a block of such as polybutadiene. The resulting product can be coupled, if desired. This generalliyed procedure is described in such asU. S. 3,825,623. Such polymers are useful in molded goods, hot melt adhesives, and other purposas. Unfortunately, tha prior art process have bean faced vith a major problem of low conversion of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer, such as described ia U. S. 3,825,623 at column 3. An alpha methylstyrene type monomer, when polymerised anionically, establishes a reaction equilibrium betwwen monomer polymer. Additional monomer does tend to force tba formation of additional polymer or, the use of low temperature does psrmit the formation of additional polymer with lower monomer presence, in effect tending to push the reaction toward the desired polymer. However, in order to effectively polymerize a conjugated diane thereon, the polymerizstion temperature znust be raised. The natural tendency is for the alpha methylstyrene type monomer polymer equilibrium to immediately return in the direction of unreacted monomer, thus depolymerizing the poly alpha methylstyrene type monomer block.This can occur vith unseemingly rapidity. This difficulty means variable sizes of poly alpha methylstyrene type monomer block, inadequate incorporation of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer, more monomer remains present after the conjugated diene polymerization, and monomers rust be separated and recycled for economy, Sometimes the separation procedures from tile polymeriyation diluent are difficult. What is needed is a method to enforce good substantial conversion in the polymerization of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer, and then to hold it, avoiding depolymerization, while neatly copolymerizing thereon the conjugated diane and at the same time further copolymerising any remaining alpha methylstyrene type monomer to relativaly high convergion. Brief Description of tile Invention I have discovered a process for preparing copolymers of alpha methylstyrene type monomers with conjugated diene monomers with increased conversion of the alpila methyls tyrene type monomer to polymer.Hy process involves a capping step after polymerizing the alpha methylstyrene type monomer to hold it, and to prevent dtpolymerization when additional solvent is added, or when the polymerization temperature is raised, for polymerization of the major proportion of the conjugated diene mononer to polymer. In my process an alpha msthylatyrene type monomer is polymerized in the presence of a first polar activator under moderately low temperature anionic solution polymerization conditions a small amount of conjugated diets monomer is added while still at the low temperature and polymerized to form a protective cap to prevent depolymerization and then further conjugated diene monomer is added as desired and polymerized at moderately elevated polymerization temperatures to form polyconjugated diane using a second polar activator to assure complete copolymerization of the conjugated diene with the residual alpha methylstyrene type monomer.The second polar activator can be present initially, be added at the capping stage, but must at least be present by the third stage polymerization of the conjugated diana. The to prepared block copolymer can be recovered by conventional termination procedures. This termination can include liniar coupling, or coupling with multifunctional agents to produce a branched copolymer. Detailed Description of the Invention In accordance with my process, an alpha methylstyrene type monomer is polymerized with an organomonolithium initiator under solution polymerization conditions at a first polymerization temperature employing a first polar activating agent polar activator until polymerization equilibrium is obtained between momomer polymer. In z second step1 a all capping amount of conjugated dione is added preferably with additional polymerization diluent, and polymerised tis maintaining the first lower polymerization temperature to provide a capping operation effective to prevent depolzmerization of the poly 9alpha methylstyrene type monomer block so far formed. Rezidual alpha methylstyrene type monomer remains present since no appreciable nopolymerization occurs unless the second polar activator is present, and the temperature is raised. In the third step, additional conjugated diane monomer is added and polymerized sufficient to fore tha desired size polyconjugated diene , preferably together with additional polymarization diluent, and in the presence of an effective amount of a second polar activator at an increased second higher polymerization temperature for effective conjugated diene polimerization. The dual activator system provides further substantial copolymerization of residual alpha methylstyrene type monomer. I have obtained as mush as 86 weight percent total conversion of alpha methylstyrene type monomer, and more usually about 80 veight percent. The fourth step is termination of living lithium ends1 either termination as such or by coupling with coupling agents to form linear or radial branched block copolymers. Any broad ratio of alpha methylstyrene type monomer conjugated diena monomer in polymerization is suitable in the preparatian of copolymers according to wy invention. Centrally, the ratio of charged monomers vill be about 95 5 to 5 95, wore usaIly 45 75 to 75 25 weight of total conjugated diene alpha methylstyrene type monomer charged to polymerization. Alpha methylstyrene type Monomers Alpha methylstyrene itself La the presently preferred monomer due to availability and relatively favorable economics. However, alpha methylstyrene type monomers broadly are useful and operable.Typically, these range 19 from 24 carbon atoms per molecule. Substituted alpha methylstyrenes having one or more substitutes on the aromatic ring are suitable in which the substituents are selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or combination radicals, each having one to eight carbon atoms per substituent. Nonlimiting examples include alpha methylstyrene, alpha methyl 4 butylstyrene,alpha methyl 3,5 di t butylstyrene, alpha methyl 3,4,5 trimethylstyrene,alpha methyl 4 benzylstyrene, alpha methyl 4 cyclohexylstyrene, and the like, alone, or nixtures. Conjugated Diene Monomers Conjugated dienes employed in the process of my invention include my of tba conjusated dienes, preferably the hydrocarbon conjugated dienes, known to polymerize with lithium iniators under anionic solution polymerization conditions. On an example basis, these conjugated dienes for availability contain 4 to 12 carbon atoms par molecule, preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms pcr roletuli, and preferably for industrial purposes those of 4 or 5 carbon atoms per molecule. The conjugated dienes form the elestomeric block of the resulting copolymer. Examples of the conjugated disnas include the presently preferred 1,3 butadiene and isoprene, as well as 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 butadiene, 2 methyl 1,3 pentadiene, 2,3 dimethyl 1,3 pentadiene, 2 methyl 3 ethyl 1,3 pentadiene, 2 phenyl 1,3 butadiene, and the like, alone, or in admixture. Initiators Any of the hydrocarbon monolithium initiators known in the anionic solution polymerisation art can be employed. Tipically these can be represented by KLi in which R is t hydrocarbon radical and call be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, or aromatic, containiag at lust one carbon atom per molecule.The number of carbon atoms and consequently the molecule weight of the hydrocarbon monolithium initiator is not limited as far as operability is concerned, though those of up to about 20 carbon atoms are more readily available. Most frequently employed are the aliphatic monolithium types. Exemplary initiators include such as n butyllithium, eac butyllithium, n decyllithium, phenyllithium, l naphthyllithium, p tolyllithium, cyclohexyllithium, eicosyllithium, and the like, alone usually, though mixtures are suitabla. The amount of initiator employed depeads on the polymer molecular weight desired and thus varies widely. Typically, the amount of initiator is in the approximate range of 0.05 to 20 equivalents of lithium per 100 grams of total monomer The initiator conveniently is employed as a solution in a hydrocarbon polymerisation diluent. Polymerization Diluents Polymerization is conducted by contacting the monomer charge with the monolithium initiator in a suitable polymerization diluent. Suitable diluents include any of the paraffinic, cycloparaffinic, or aromatic hydrocrbons known to the art, used alone or in admixture, typically of 4 to 10 carbon atoms per molecule Various substances are known to be detrimental to the initiator aid the liting polymer, including such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, and water. It is desirable that the reactants, the polymerization apparatus, and the reactant mixture be freed of these materials as wall as any other materials which inactivate the respective reactive soecies present throuihout the process. Any of the knawn methods for removing such contaminants can be used.Therefore, whatever a diluent is employed in the process, it is preferred that the diluant be substantially free of impurities such as those listed above. In this connection it is desirable to remove the air and moisture from the reaction vessel in which the polymerization is conducted. Exemplary species include such as n hexane, n heptane, cyclohexane, cycloheptane, benzene, toluene, the xylenes, 2,2,4 trimethylheptne, and the like. Cyclohexane currently is preferred for ease of handlin , high solubility of polymer, and availability. First Step Polymerization The alpha methylstyrene type monomer is polymerized as a relatively concentrated solution in s polymerisation diluent. The monomeridiluent weight ratio can very somewhat, but should represent a resonably concentrated solution of monomer, such as about 9 1 to 1 5, preferably 5 1 to ls2, weight ratio of first charge of monomeridiluent. Such a relatively concentrated polymerization solution is desirable since the polymerization equilibrium, that is, the extent of monomer conversion, is significantly influnced by the smormt of diluent present. Me higher solvent levels tend to shift the equilibrium in the direction of unreacted monomer, rather than in the desired direction of polar. The cboice of the first lower polymerisation temperature is influenced by the desired combination of solution viscosity, polymerization rate, and monomer conversion. A compromise is necessary. Low temperature polymerization favors higher alpha methylstyrene type monomer conversion to polymer, but this is at the expense of polymerization rates and higher solution viscosities. Polymerization of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer presently preferably is conducted at t first polymerization temperature in the range of about OC to 40 C, more preferably about 3 C to 35 C. Undesirable side reactions occur at higher temperatures and the percentage conversion which can be attained rapidly diminishes. The polymerization of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer is conducted in tba pretence of an effective amount of a first polar activator, optionally in the presence of the second polar activator0 The first polar activator increases the polymerization rate or propagation rate of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer without increasing the rate of undesirable side or termnation reactions s is as relatively short polymerization times are employed. Suitable as first polar activators are polar compounds which do not contain an active hydrogen atom. These polar compounds can contain oxygen, sulphur, as Yell as nitrogen. It is preferred that the activator have a dielectric constant of between 2 and 9. Suitable first polar activators include such os dimethyl other, diethyl ether, diamyl ether, dimethoxyethane, bis 2 ethoxyethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, hexamethylphosphoramide, tributylamine, and hexamethylenetetramine, and mixtures. Presently preferred is tetrahydrofuran. The first polar activator normally is add to the polymerization mixture in the amount of about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of total monomers, preferably 1 to 5 parts to prevent undesired side reactions and to maintain ultimate vinyl content within the desired ranges. The pressure employed can be as convenient. Preferably, a pressure is employed sufficient to maintain monomer and diluent substantially in the liquid phase. The polymeriation time can vary widely as may be convenient, and wills of course, be affected by the polymerization temperature chosen. Generally, the alpha methylstyrene type monomer is allowed to polymerize for less than about 120 minutes, since, at longer polyntrization times, termination of the living polymer tends to occur.At this stage, despite the favorable influences of lower temperature, minimal diluent, first polar activator, and short polymerization time, there are present substantial proportions of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer, and the polymer at this stage itself is not stable. Capping In the second step, a small amount of conjugated diene is added, conveniently as a dilute solution in polymerization diluant. This capping step is the polymerization of the small amount of conjugated drone and is conducted within the relatively low first polymerization temperature, range described for the first step polymerization of the aIpha methylstyrene type monomer.This step and resulting small block of poly conjugated diene provides a capping of the poly alpha methylstyrene type monomer styrylllthium . The cap avoids depolymerization when the polymerization temperature is raised and or when further relatively large amounts of polymerization diluent are added in the third step. Both of these conditions normaHy are utilized for optimun polymerization of the conjugated diane added latcr, and both factors would otherwise tend to cause depolymeri ation of the block of poly alpha metaylstgrene type monomer so far produced.The small suitable effective amount of conjugated diene added for capping the live poly alpha methylstyrene type monomer is defined as an amount of at least about 1 mole per mole of living alpha methylstyrene type polymer. The upper limit of this amount is not critical, but it is preferable to keep it as low as possible to reduce depolymerization induced by the heat of reaction of diene polymerization. Usually it will be less than about 100 moles. The weight ratio of additional polymerization diluent to conjugated diene added for the capping step generally is about 10 1 to 1000 1, although the conjugated diene can be added without dilution if desired depending on the polymerization solution viscosity. The polymerization time for forming the poly conjugated diane cap is short in duration. The completion of the polyCconjugated diene cap formation is indicated by the disappearance of the red color of the poly alpha methyletyrene type monomer styryllithium in the polymerization mixture. This normally requires about 1 to 120 minutes. While this step protects the polymer of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer against depolymerization, yet the substantial amounts of unpolymerized alpha ethylstyrene type monomer are still present primarily in solution in the diluent. Third Step Polymerization The second or further addition of conjugated diene is to form the poly l,3 conjugated diene to provide the desired rubbery component of the copolymer. This third polymerization usually uses additional polymerization hydrocarbon diluent so as to keep the reaction mixture viscosity low enough to be adequately stirred. The conjugated diene is preferably polymerized at a higher second polymerization temperature than at the lower first polymerization temperature used for alpha methylstyrone type monomer polymerization since higher temperatures favor s desirably higher rate of conjugated diene polymerization and also further reduce the solution viscosity, The temperature of the polymerization mixture now can safely be raised, and additional polymerization diluent added, without depolymerization since the poly alpha methylstyrene type monomer styryllithium has been protectively capped by the capping step described above. Polymerization of the conjugated diene is conducted in the presence of a second polar activator, Which is an alkali metal alkoxide.These alkali metal alkoxides are organic compounds of an alkali metal other than lithium, more particularly of sodium, potassium, rubidum, or cesium. Any of the alkoxides of this nature are suitable for my process. Conveniently, the alkoxides can be represented by R OM in whichM represents the alkali metal just nientioned, and R is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, or combination hydrocarbon radical, and for convenience usually is of the order of 1 to 20 carbon atoms. These include the sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium salte of such as iathyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, tert butyl alcohol, tert amyl alcohol, n hexyl alcohol, cyclohexyl alcohol, eicosyl alcohol, 2 butenyl alcohol, 4 methylcyclohexyl alcohol, 3 hexenyl alcohol, 2,5 decadienyl alcohol, 3 cyclopentenyl alcohol, 4,6 di n butyldecyl alcohol, 4,8 dodecadienyl alcohol, allyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, 3 4 tolyl propyl alcohol, phenol, 1 naphthol, 2 naphthol, 2,6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol Ionol , 2,4,6 tri tert butylphenol, 2,6 di tert butyl 4 phenylphenol, 2,6 di sec butyl 4 methylphenol, and the like, alone or in admixture. Especially suitable are potassium alkoxides, and presently preferred from my work is potassium tertiary amyloxide. During polymerization of the conjugated diene with the alkali metal alkoxide and the first polar activator which, of course, is still present since it was added during the polymerization of the alpha methylstyrene type monomer, further residual unreacted alpha methylstyrene type monomer is randomly copolymerized with the conjugated diene monomer, thus substantially increassing the overall alpha methylstyrene conversion. The amount of polymerization diluent to be added at this third stage polymerization, can very widely. It is convenient to use the same polymerization diluent in such stage to avoit possible complexities in ultimate separation and recycle. Generally, sufficient polymerization diluent is added such tbat the ratio of total weight of diluent to total weight of all rs added in all steps of the polymerization process is about 3 1 to 25 1, preferably about 5 1 to 10 1. The amount of alkali metal aloxide added is such that the H Li molar ratio is within the broad range of about 10 1 to 1 10, presently preferably about 5 1 to 1 5 because of improved effectiveness, wherein M represents the alkali aetal other than lithium. The temperature range normally employed for this step of the process is in the range of about 0 C to 140 C, preferably about 50 C to about 120 C. for convenience and improved effectiveness. The polymerization time for formation of the poly conjugated diene normally is in the range of about 2 minutes to several hours, preferably 5 minutes to 30 minutes. 5 10 13 20 25 30 35 At the completion of the polymerization steps, the living polymers, polymers containing carbon lithium moietics and thus capable of propagating further polymerization, are terminated. In the context of this specification, the term termination refers either to termination as such of the polymer lithium by conventional noncoupling type of final termination by removal of the active lithium such as with water, acid, lower alcohol, or the like, which remove the lithium and substituting a hydrogen or by reaction with a coupling agent.The term coupling as herein employed is a generic term meaning the bringing together and joining by means of a central coupling atoa or coupling moiety two or more of the living lithium terminated polymer chains so as to produce either a linear coupled product, or radially branched coupled product.Of course, it is recognized that a coupling agent is not necessarily 100 percent efficient, and that any coupling procedure usually result in some species remaining uncoupled, while in the case of a polyfunctional coupling agent containing three or more coupling entities, that some of the coupling moieties My result in a partially linear coupled faction as well as s substantial radially coupled faction in the coupled product. A wide variety of compounds suitable for such purposes can be employed. Among the suitable coupling agents are the multivinylaromatic compounds, multiepoxides, multiisocyanates, multiimines, multialdehydes, multiketones, multianhydrides, multiesters which are the esters of polyalcohols with monocarboxylic acids, or esters of polyacids with monohydric alcohols, and the diesters which are esters of monohydric alcohols with dicarboxylic acids, monoesters of either type, multihalides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and the like. Furthermore, compounds containing more than one type of functional group are useful as coupling agents. Examples of suitable multivinylaromatic compounds include divinylbenzene, 1,2,4 trivinylbenzene, 1,3 divinylnaphthalene, 1,8 diviinylnaphthalene, 1,3,5 trivinylnaphthalene, 2,4 divinylbiphenyl, and the like. The divinylaromatic hydrocarbons are preferred, particularly divinylbenzene in ether its ortbo, ta, or para isomer. Ccnmnarcial divinylbenrene which is a mixture of the three isomers and other compounds is quite satisfactory. While any multiepoxide can be used, preferred are those which are liquid since they are more readily handled and form a relatively small nucleus for the rsdial polymer. Especially preferred among the multiepoxides are the epoxidized hydrocarbon polymers such as epoxidized liquid polybutadiene and the epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soybean oil and tpoxidized linseed oil. Other epoxy compounds such as 1,2 5,6 9,10 triepoxydecane, and the like, also can be used. Examples of suitable multiisocyanates include benzene 1,2,4 triisocyanate, naphthalene 1,2,5,7 tetraisocyanate, and the like. Especially suitable is a com ercially available product known as PAPI l, a polyarylpolyisocyanate having an average of three isocyanate groups per molecule and an average molecular weight of about 380. Such a compound can be visualized as a series of isocyanate subtituted benzene rings joined through methylene linkages. The multiimines, which are also known as multiaziridinyl compounds, preferably are those containing 3 or more aziridine rings per molecule. Examples of sch compounds include the triaziridinyl phosphine oxides or sulfidas such as tri l nziridinyl phosphine oxide, tri 2 methyl 1 aziridinyl phosphine oxide, tri 2 ethyl 3 decyl 1 aziridinyl phosphine sulfide, and the like. The multialdehydes are represented by compounds such as 1,4,7 naphthalene tricarboxyaldehyde, 1,7, 9 anthracene tricarboxyaldehyde, 1,1, 3 pentane tricarboxyaldehyde, and similar multialdehyde containing aliphatic and aromatic copounds. me multiketones can be represented by compounds such as 1,4,9,10 anthracenetetrone, 2,3 diacetonylcyclohexanone, and the like. Examples of the multianhydrides include pyromallitic dianhydride, styrene maleic anhydride copolymers, and the like. Examples of the di and multiesters include diethyl adipate, trlethyl citrate, 1,3,5 tricarbethoxybenzene, and the like. Among the multihalides, presently preferred are the silicon tetrahalides such as silicon tetrachloride, silicon tetrabromide. and silicon tetraiodide and the trihalohydrocarbylsilanes such as trifluorophenylsilane, trichloroethylsilane, tribromobenzylsilane, and the like. Also preferred are the multihalogen substituted hydrocarbons, such as 1,3,5 tri bromomethyl benzene, 2,3,6,9 tetrachloro 3,7 decadiene, and the like, ia which the halogen is attached to a carbon atom which is alpha to an activating group such as an ether linkage, a carbonyl group, or a carbon to carbon double bond. Substituents inert with respect to lithium atoms in the terninally reactive polymer can also be present in the active halogen containing compounds. Alternatively, other suitable reactive groups different from the halogen as described above can be present. Examples of compounds containing sore than one type of functional group include 1,3 dichloro 2 propanone, 2,2 dibromo 3 decanone, 3,5,5 trifluoro 4 octanone, 2,4 dibromo 3 pentanone, 1,2 4,5 diepoxy 3 pentanone, 1,2 4,5 diepoxy 3 hexanone, 1,2 11,12 diepoxy 8 pentadecanone, 1,2 18,19 diepoxy 7,14 eicoxanedione, and the like. In addition to the silicon multihalides U described hereinabove, other metal multihalides, particularly those of tin, lead, or germanium, also can be readily employed as coupling and branching agents. Difunctional counterparts of these agents also can be employed, thereby s lett polymer polr rather tb8n a branched polymer results. Por the parpaoa of coupling, one equivalent of coupling agent per equivalent of lithium is considered an optfrtim amount for maximum branching. Any range of treating agent can be employed, depending on the degree of coupling desired. Broadly, about 0.3 to 1.5 equivalents per equivalent of lithium usually is used. The coupling agent can be added nut, or alternately added in an inert hydrocarbon solution, such as in cyclohexane. The coupling agent can be added in one batch, or alternately may be added incrementally or continuously. The coupling reaction normally is conducted at the same temperature as employed in the third polymerization step, this being broadly about 0 C to 140 C, preferabyl about 50 C to 120 C. The time for the coupling reaction can range from a few minutes to several hours, preferably from 1 minute to 30 minutes.The polymerization solution with the added coupling agents are agitated for the duration of the coupling reaction. Polymer Recovery After the completion of the terminating or coupling redaction, the polymer can be recovered by methods wail knc n in the art. In one suitable method water or alcohol is added to the mixture to precipitate the polymer. The polymer then is separated from the alcohol or water and diluent by any suitable mans such as decantation or filtration. It has also been found advantageous to add an antioxidant, such as 2,6 di t butyl 4 methylphenol, to the polymer mixture prior to precipitation of the polymer.It is, of course, to be realized that it is within the scope of the invention to e nploy other suitable means to recover the polymer from solution such as, for example, steam stripping.liter separation from the solvent mixture and alcohol or water by filtration or other suitable means, the polar is dried.

Particular species and components used, operating conditions, and other values, should be considered as illustrative, and not limitative of the reasonable scope of my invention, which scope is baaed on ly overall disclosure. Example I This example demonstrates the improvement in alpha methylstyrene monomer conversion in the preparation of alpha methylstyrene butadiene block copolymers when potassium tertiary amyloxide is added to the polymerization mixture during polymerization of the butadiene. Alpha methylstyrene butadiene block copolymers were prepared according to the general procedure of Recipe I Recipe IStep I Alpha methylstyrene, parts by weight 51 Cyclohexane, parts by weight 14 n Butyllithium, mehma 2.0 Tetrahydrofuran, parts by weight 1.4 Polymerization temperature, C 30 Polymerisation time, minutes 30Step It 1,3 Butadiene, parts by weight 2 Cyclohexane, parts by weight 59 Polymerisation temperature, C 30 Polymerization time, minutes 30Step III 1,3 Butadiene, parts by weight 47 Cyclohexane, parts by weight 530 Potassium t amyloxide KTA , mehma Variable Polymerization temperature, C 70 Polymerization time, minutes VariableStep IV Silicon tetrachloride, mehma 2.4 Reaction temperature, C 70 Reaction time, minutes 8 to a Mhm Milliequivalents par 100 grams of total monomers added in all steps of recipe. b Silicon tetrachloride was added incrementally in four batches, the first batch being 5 times the amount of each of the other three batches. Increments were added at one minute intervals, and the reaction mixture allowed to stir for 5 or 10 minutes after addition of the last increment. The conversion of al,pba methylstyrene to polymer, the weight percent alpha methylstyrene in the final polymer, and the wight percent block poly alpha methylstyrene in the final polymer, as a function of the amount of potassium t amyloxide added during polybutadiene block formation are shown in Table I TABLE I Alpha MethylstyreneRun KTA, Step III BlockNo.a mehm K Li Time, min.

Moreover, the percent conversion is a function of the amount of KTA. These data also demonstrate that the increased conversion results in the incorporation of alpha methylstyrene as random copolymer, as shown by the higher total percent incorporated into the polymer but with no increase in block poly alpha methylstyrene . That the polymerization time of butadiene Polymerization over the range employed Step III does not influence the percent conversion, as might be suggested by these data, is shon in Example 11. Example II This example demonstrates that the increase in alpha methylstyrene conversion is t function of KTA concentration, and not t function of polymerization time, over the range of time employed. Polymers were prepared according to Recipe I of Example I.

Example III This example demonstrates the influcence on alpha methylstyrene conversion of capping the poly alpha methylstyryllithium prior to polybutadiene block formation. Polymers were prepared according to Recipe I with the exception that in control Pun 8, no butadiene was added in Step II.

Thls is in excellent agreement withRim No. I in Table I of Example I, again at different ratio of monomers, different THF level, and different K Li ratios as mentioned above. Run o. U demonstrates that addition of KTA in Step I with theTHF results in high alpha methylstyrene conversion, with about the same distribution of the poly alpha methylstyrene between random and block polymer as is obtained when the KTA i6 added in Step III. These results would indicate that addition of KTA ia Step I with THF is as affective, if not more so, in improving alpha methylstyrene conversion than when theKTA is added in Step ITI. Run No. 12, in which no THF was aded, shows that KTA is not an effective initiation activator for alpha methylstyrene, a significant amount of the unpolymerized alpha methylstyrene from Step I being randomly polymerized with the butadiene to give a final polymer containing 22 percent random poly alpha methylstyrene copolymer. These data demonstrate that Km can be added either in Step I or Step III to significantly improve alpha methylstyrene conversion, and that KTA is not an effective alpha methylstyrene initiation activator, and that an activator such as THF is required to effectively initiate the formation of block poly alpha methylstyrene .
