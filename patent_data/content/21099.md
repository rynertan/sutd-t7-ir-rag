# Multiple pitch escapement and backspace mechanism for a moving paper carriage typewriter.

## Abstract
A mechanism that allows escapement of the carriage of a typewriter in one of a plurality of predetermined escapement pitches and is capable of backspace operation for all of the pitches from a single backspace input, regardless of which pitch is selected. Escapement ratchets 24, 28 and a backspace ratchet 26 are adapted to rotate together around a common axis 22 . Each of the escapement ratchets 24, 28 is engageable by an escapement pawl 30, 50 and the selective engagement of a pawl with a particular ratchet determines the pitch. A backspace pawl 60 is selectably engageable with the backspace ratchet 26 and rotates the same in a backspacing direction by an angle slightly greater than that defined by two consecutive teeth on the maximum pitch ratchet 24 . The rotation of any ratchet 24, 26, 28 is converted, through a pinion 20 and rack 18 arrangement, into a translation of the carriage.
