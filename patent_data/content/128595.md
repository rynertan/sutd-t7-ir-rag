# VALVE AND LID ASSEMBLY FOR A CONTAINER

## Abstract
A valve and lid assembly comprises a self closing dis charge valve constituted by a dome part, having a central opening, of a lid closing the open top end of a pressurized container and serving as the obturating member of the valve by obturating ducts through a valve disc of elastically resilient material which is lodged in the dome part. When opening the valve by downward or tilting pressure exerted with the aid of a tubulure or the like actuating member on the valve disc, the latter is deformed so as to establish free communication between at least one of the ducts therein and the hollow interior of the tubulure which can carry a conventional atomizer head having a spray nozzle.
