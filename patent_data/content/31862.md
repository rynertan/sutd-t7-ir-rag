## Description
Improved method and Apparatus for Aftertreatment of Textile Material by Application of MicrowavesBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to iriproved method and apparatus for aftertreatment of textile material by application of microwaves, and more particularly relates to improvement in effective drying of scoured or dyed textile material by means of irradiation of micro aves. Fixing and development of dyes on dyed textile material have long been carried out by means of steaming the dyed tetile material after interposed drying. As a substitute for the steaming process, it has recently been proposed to apply microwaves to dyed textile material in wet state0 Here, the word 1microwaves refers to electromagnetic waves whose frequencies are in a range from 300 to 30,000 MHz. Microwaves are provided with various advantages in particular when.they are used in treatment of textile material in wet state. Firstly, they permeate into the textile material extremely quickly and heat it within a very short time. secondly, since their heat generation is based on dielectric loss, they are selectively absorbed in objects with large dielectric loss in order to heat necessary object only whilst avoiding heating of unnecessary object or objects. Thirdly, the treated textile material generates heat by itself whilst avoiding the need for heating the ambient atmosphere and or the heater equipment, thereby assuring high rate of thermal efficiency.Fourthly, since they cause simultaneous temperature rise at different sections of the treated material, difference in tenperature between the core and surface sections of the material is very small, thereby assuring ideally uniform heating of the material. Fifthly, adjustment of the output voltage for the microwaves enables simple and easy control of the heating condition in accordance bath requirement in the actual treatment. Irradiation of microwaves onto a textile material causes ionic conduction and dipole rotation of the fibers composing the textile material and water and or agents contained in the material in order to cause rapid and uniform heating of the textile material. A pride variety of systems have been proposed in order to practice the above described microwave irradiation in treat ment of textile materials, but quite a few of yen have ee, feasible in practical industrial scale. One cause for this difficulty resides in the manner of irradiation of microwaves. An applicator is generally used for tliis purpose and the conventional applicators are roughly classified into three types, i.e. the applicator vith a hairpin curved waveguide, the applicator vzith a densely hairpin curved waveguide, and the oven type applicator. In the case of the applicator using the waveguide, heating effect is greatly affected by wave length of the microwave irradiated and uneven heating the matrial tends to take place. Consesuently, the applicators of these types are unsuited for treatment of dyed or scoured textile m.ateri als, which required high rate of unifor ity heating effect. In the case of the oven type applicator including a metallic hexahdral irradiation chamber, it is necessary to employ any expedient to equalize the intensity of the magnetic field surrounding the material in the chamber. Otiiervise, the applicator of this type is quite unsuited for use in practical industrial scale although it may operate in order in laboratories. The other cause for the above described difficulty resides in fusion of fibers composing a textile material during, or as a result of, heating by application of microwaves. This is in particular a serious problem when the textile material is composed of thermoplastic synthetic fibers such as acrylic fibers. Such fusion of the textile material is caused by temperature rise in water as a dyeing medium and or a high boiling point agent or agents as assitants, both being contained in the textile material after dyeing.For example, in the case of a textile material made of acrylic fibers which can be dyed at a temperature close to the boiling point of pure tauter, swelling of the dyed fibers starts at a temperature close to 100 C and, regardless of its dielectric constant, dipole rotation occurs in the fibers, which causes abrupt evacuation of water, temperature rise and eventual fusion of the fibers. In order to prevent such fusion of fibers composing the textile material, it is absolutely necessary to prevent evacuation of water contained in the fibers during the treatment. A further cause for the above described difficulty resides in the manner to prevent the above described evacuation of water contained in the fibers during the treatment. For this effect, a textile material is trsnsported trough the microwave applicator zone or zones while being clamped between a pair of running endless belts or being placed in surface contact vith a wet sheet. In either cases, possible contami nation on the belts or sheet tends to develop blemishes on the textile material, which greatly degrades its commercial value. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is one object of the present invention is to provide ideal aftertreatment of textile material by application of microwaves smith highly uniform heating effect. It is another object of the present invention to provide successful aftertreatment of textile material by application of microwaves without causing any accidental fusion of fibers composing the material during the treatment. It is the other object of the present invention to provide advantageous anterbreat ent of textile material by application of microwaves without cevelo nent of any blemish on the treated material. It is a further object of the present invention to provide economical aftertreatment of textile material by application of microwaves with simple const muction in equip r. ent. In accordance with the basic mehtod of the present in invention. A scoured or dyed textile material is first subjected to preparatory heating in et state on its con tinuous travelling course. Thereafter, the textile material in the form of a rotating roll is subjected to irradiation of microwaves within a steamed atmosphere. In one embodiment of the present invention, aDplication of the microwaves lasts during rotation of the roll for vjind ing up the textile material and subsecuent positive rotation of the roll, the latter preferably lasting for 10 to 20 minutes. In another eribodirnent of the present invention, appli cation of the microwaves lasts during rotation of the roll for inding up the textile material only, In the oter embodiment of the present invention, application of the microwaves lasts during. positive rotation of the roll for 19 tD 20 minutes only afterwinf winding up of the material is over. In accordance with the basic apparatus of the present invention, a preparatory heating chamber is arranged on the travelling course of a textile material, which the material travels through. Further, an almost confined microwave irradiation chamber is arranged on the downstream side of the preparatory heating chamber, in which means for winding up the introduced textile material into a roll, means for posi tively rotating the roll, an applicator of the microwaves, and means for steaming the interior of the irradiation chamber are arranged.The inlet to the irradiation chamber is properly sheltered in order to block accidental leakage of the steam and microwaves prevailing vathin the chamber. DYE ION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a side view, partly in section, of an embodiment of the apparatus in accordance tith the present invention, and Fig. 2 is an enlarged siQe sectional vie of the sheltered construction of the inlet used in the apparatus shov,n in Fig. 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERED EMBODIMENTS It should be unerstood that, although the following description is focussed upon treatment of dyed textile material, tile rn esent invention is equally applicable to treatment of scored textile material. A basic embodiment of the apparatus in accordance vJith the present invention is shown in Fig. 1, in which the apna ratus includes, as major elements, a preparatory heating chamber 1 and a microwave irradiation chamber 2 arranged in sequence with each other in the travelling direction of a textile material ì.I It should be understood that the present invention is well applicable to treatment of a textile material of any form. It may be a woven cloth, a knitted cloth or flat sheet of threads arranged side by side relationship to eanh other. It should d be further understood tiiat the present ii tren tion is swell applicable to treatment of a textile material dyed in any manner. It may be dyed by winch dyeing, Åaigger dyeing, beam dyeing, pad winch process, pad jig process, pad batch process, pad steam process, or screen or roll printing. It should be further understood that the present inven tion is ell applicable to treatment of a scoured or dyed textile material made o any fibers including natural, regenerated and synthetic fibers, although it it is most advantageously applied to treatment of a textile material made of synthetic fibers. Chambers 1 and 2 are both connected to 2 steam pipe 3 for feeding steam of a ro oer pressure to their interiors. The preparatory heating chamber 1 is internally provided with a feed guide roller 11 arranged near its inlet, 2 deli very guide roller 12 arranged near its outlet, and a number of intermediate guide rollers 13 arranged in the zone between the to rollers 11 and 12.The number and arrangement of the intermediate guide rollers 13 can be freely designed de,en ding on recuirenent for the length of the travelling path of the textile material through the camber 1. Preparatory heating should be applied to the textile material in wet state. In application of the present invention, the preparatory heating has its particular significance when the textile material is made of synthetic fibers such as polyamide, polyester and acrylic fibers, since such fibers may fuse during the treatment depending on the teeth of the treatment and the output power of the microwaves. In the case of hydrophilic fibers such.as cellulose fibers, colour fixing starts several seconds after imitation of microwave irradiation and its dyeing affinity arrives at the highest value v ithin about 20 seconds. In contrast to this, hydrophobi c fibers such as polyam de fibers require microwave irradiation over a period of 5 minutes or longer.This is because of the fac that a relatively long time is required to cause swelling of the textile material to an extent enough to allow appreciable diffusion of dyes into the fibers composing the textile material. However, as described already, log irradiation of microwaves on a textile material ineviinably causes fusion of the fibers composing the textile material. In order to obviate such a trouble, it may be thinkable to employ relatively long irradiation of microwaves whilst cutting down the output powder of the microwaves. But, such a long irradiation degrades the basic merit of treatment by application of microwaves, i.e. rapid processing. In accordance v.ith the present invention, the prepara tory heating preceding the microwave irradiation causes appreciable, though not enough, swelling of the textile material, thereby enabling relatively short microwaves irradiation for diffusion of dyes. The microwave irradiation chamber 2 is provided with a microwave applicator 21 electrically connected in a knovm manner to a microizave generator not shovm The textile material M introduced into the chamber 2 is wound up into a roll R via a feed guide roller 22 and an intermediate guide roller 23. A knorn driving mechanism is arranged in order to rotate the roll R following any programmed sequence including positive rotation after complete winding up. The winding up speed of the textile material is in a range from 50 to 100 MPM and the length of a unit textile material is about 2,000 meters for the unit weight 100 g mê and about 1,000 meters for the unit weight 200 g m2. A microwave generator of the maximum output power 10 The at 2450 MHz frequency may be used. Oscillation of microwaves is carried out by to sets of water cooling type magnetron of 5 KW output po ver. Any known type of waveguide may be used as long as it assures uniform irradiation on the textile material in the roll form. The microwave irradiation should be carried out under saturation of the chamber 2 with steam. In case any animal fiber such as wool is to be treated, high pressure steam of about 4 kg cmê should preferably be introduced into the chamber 2. Consequently, the interior of the irradiation chamber 2 is replete with microwaves and steam during the treatment.In order to prevent accidental leakage of the microwaves and the steam outside the chamber 2 whilst alloying free introduction of the textile material 0,I into the chamber, a particular shelter construction 24 is arranged in the zone between the feed and intermediate rollers 22 and 23, which is shorm in detail in Fig. 2. The shelter construction 24 is arranged within a space defined by a pair of relatively thick vertical walls 25 and 26 which prevent depositing of dews on the construction.The outer wall 25 is provided ith a ventilation duct 27 whose inner opening is covered with a crunched plate 28 for preventing leakage of electric waves via the duct 27. The top of the space is covered by an adjustable slit plate 241 whose opening is freely adjustable in size in accordance with the processing conditions. A blocking filter 242 is arranged vertically below the slit plate 241, which includes a plurality of electric wave damping elements 242a aligned vertically whilst facing the travelling path of the textile material tI. An electric wave absorber plate 242b is vertically arranged on the opposite side of the travelling path.Even when the microwaves in the chamber 2 leak outside via the slit plate 241, they are almost fully attenuated during their travel through the blocking filter 242. Leakage of the steam in the chamber 2 is extremely minimized due to the presence of the slit plate 241. A water reservoir 2e3 is arranged in the proximity of the inlet guide roller 22 below the inner wall 26, which absorbs microwaves surviving even after passage through the blocking filter 242. Irradiation of the microwaves should be carried out with the roll being in rotation. In the ordinary case, the irradiation lasts during anding up of the textile material on the roll and subsequent positive rotation of the roll.This positive rotation may last for 10 to 20 minutes. The irradiation may last during the winding up of the textile material only. It may also last during the subsequent posi tive rotation only for 10 to 20 minutes. Choice of the irradiation is dependent upon the process conditions. EXU,IPL3S Example 1.
