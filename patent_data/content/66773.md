## Description
The present invention relates to a new intermediate of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 C5 alkyl, useful for the preparation of pharmacologically active 4,5 dihydro 4 phenyl 3H 1,3 benzodiazepines, and to a method for the preparation of this intermediate, which comprises reacting an N acylated o toluidine of the formula IIEMI1.2 with n alkyl lithium to provide a dilithio compound of the formula IIIEMI1.3 and quenching this compound with N benzylidene amine of the formula IVEMI1.4 wherein R1 is hydrogen or C1 C5 alkyl. Hydrolysis of the compound of the formula I yields the free base of the formula V EMI2.1 or its salt, which can be cyclized, as described in the published European Patent Application No. 0 009 800, with a compound of the formula VIEMI2.2 wherein R is hydrogen or C1 C5 alkyl and R2 is methyl or ethyl, to form a compound of the formula VIIEMI2.3 wherein R and R1 are as defined above. This compound, its optical antipodes and physiologically acceptable salts are useful as antidepressants, analgetics and anticonvulsants. Of particular interest for these purposes are the hydrochloride salts of the 4 phenyl 1,3 benzodiazepine of formula VII. The 4 phenyl 1,3 benzodiazepines, methods for their preparation and compounds useful as intermediates in their preparation are known from Published European PatentApplication No. 0 009 800. The known methods of prepa raticn require a relatively large number of steps, the steps are relatively complicated, the starting materials are costly and the yields of the a phenyl 1,3 benzo diazepines are less than desirable. Thus, there exists a need in the art for a new process for the preparation of the 4 phenyl 1 ,3 benzodiazepines. This need is fulfilled by providing the process for preparing the intermediate of the formula I from which the 4 phenyl .1,3 benzodiazepinescan be obtained in high yields and increased purity. The process according to the present invention utilizes more economical starting materials and a relatively small number of uncomplicated steps. The N acylated o toluidine of formula 11 is N 2 methyl phenyl 2, 2 dimethylpropanamide. Lithiation of aromatic compounds with an n alkyllithium compound is exemplified in J.M. Muchowski and M.Venuti, J. Org. Chem.45, 4798 4801 1980 and W. Fuhrer and H.W. Gschwend,J.Org. Chem. 44, 1133 1136 1979 . A preferred method according to the present invention involves slowly adding a solution of n butyllithium in a solvent therefor, such as hexane, to a solution of the N acylated o toluidine in an ethereal solvent, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, imethoxyethane, and a hydrocarbon solvent, such as hexane. The ethereal solvent and hydrocarbon solvent should be substantially inert to the n butyllithium to avoid adverse side reactions. The temperature during the addition can range from about 700C to about 3GOC, preferably about 100C to about 300C. The resulting mixture is aged from about one half to about 5 hours, preferably about 1 to about 2 hours.The reaction is conveniently carried out at atmospheric pressure. The amount of n butyllithium employed is up to about 10 in excess of the 2 molar equivalents required for the reaction. It is important to exclude moisture from the reaction mixture. Accordingly, the reaction is conveniently conducted in an atmosphere of a substantially dry gas, such as substantially anhydrous nitrogen The dilithio intermediate of formula III is quenched with an N benzylideneamine to provide theN 2 2 amino 2 phenylethyl phenyl 2,2 dimethylpropanamide of formula I. For instance, N benzylidenemethylamine and a method for its preparation are disclosed by R.B.Moffett et al, Org. Syn. Coll., Vol. IV, 605 608 1963 .The temperature of addition of N benzylidenealkylamine can range from about 78 0C to about 350 C, preferably 0 0 from about O to about 25 C. The mixture is aged for a period of about 5 minutes to about one hour. The amount of N benzylidenealkylamine employed is from about one to about 2 molar equivalents based on the dilithio intermediate of formula III . The quenching is conveniently conducted at atmospheric pressure and in a substantially moisture free, e.g., dry nitrogen, atmosphere. The propanamide of formula I can then be hydrolyzed to provide a compound of the formulaEMI4.1 as a free base or its salt, e.g. dihydrochloride. The aromatic amine of formula V is the immediate precursor of the 4 phenyl 1,3 benzodiazepines of formula VII. Thus, it will be understood that the salts of the compound of formula V can be general be the same as the salts of the compounds of formula VII. In one method, the compound of formula I is reacted with about 2 molar equivalents of a strong mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or sulfuric acid. 6N Hydrochloric acid is the acid of choice.The reaction is conveniently conducted at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of from about 700 to the reflux temperature of the solvent employed in the reaction for a period of about 12 to about A8 hours to provide a diacid salt, which can then be recrystallized. A solvent, such as ether o an aromatic solvent, is employed to remove any side products while retaining the diacid salt in aqueous phase. If desired, the diacid salt can be basified to provide the free base. The aromatic amine of formula V in free base or salt form can be cyclized with a compound of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R is hydrogen or C1 C5 alkyl and R is methyl or ethyl, to provide the 4 phenyl 1,3 benzodiazepines of formula VII. This cyclization can be carried out in the presence of an acid catalyst, such as ethanolic hydrochloric acid. Alternatively, the monoacid or diacid salt of the compound of formula V can be cyclized with a compound of formula VI in a polar solvent, such as acetonitrile or acetic acid this makes it unnecessary to add an acid catalyst to the reaction mixture. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature of from about 0 23 C to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture and at atmospheric pressure for at least about 1 hour, typically about 1 to about 8 hours. About 1 to about 5 molar equivalents of the compound of formula VI are employed.
