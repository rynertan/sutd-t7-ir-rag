# Method of manufacturing a detector device and detector device obtained.

## Abstract
In the manufacture of an infra red radiation detector device, a body 10 of p type cadmium mercury telluride is bombarded with ions 11 to etch away a part 21 of the body 10 and to produce from the etched away part of the body an excess concentration of mercury which acts as a dopant source converting an adjacent part 22 of the body 10 into n type material. The energy of the bombarding ions is less than 30 keV, and by appropriately choosing the ion dose this conversion can be effected over a depth considerably greater than the penetration depth of the ions 11 . A p n junction 23 can be fabri cated in this way for a photo voltaic detector. The con ductivity type conversion may even be effected through the body thickness. The etching and conversion can be localised by masking part of the body surface 20 against the ion bombardment.
