# Circuit for use in a telephone set.

## Abstract
A circuit comprising a line interruption arrangement for producing dial pulses, comprising a series arrangement of a semiconductor switching element 4 and a control device 5 connected between a first 1 and a second 2 line terminal, the first and second terminals being provided to enable con nection to a subscriber s line. To limit the current in the sub scriber s line while using a minimum of components, the control circuit5 comprises a current detection device 21 which is connected to the control electrode 6 of the semiconductor switching element 4 to drive the semiconductor switching element 4 into saturation when the line current is below a predetermined value and to drive the semiconductor switch ing element 4 out of saturation when the line current is above the said predetermined value.
