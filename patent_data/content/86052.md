# Segregator functional plane for use in a modular array processor.

## Abstract
A Segregator Functional Plane capable of dynamically segregating any number, or subset, of a Modular Array Processor s functional planes, either in terms of control or data exchange, or both, from the remainder. This is provided by interspersing a number of Segregator Functional Planes throughout the Array Processor so that a Segregator Func tional Plane is architecturally located between each of the adjacent subsets of the Array Processor s functional planes. The Segregator Functional Plane nominally includes an array of pseudomodules that corresponds to the module arrays of the other functional planes of the Array Processor so that a pseudo module is architecturally present between corres pondingly adjacent modules of each Elemental Processor. These pseudo modules are comprised of switches that may be commonly activated to functionally sever their respective Elemental Processor data bus lines. The Segregator Funtion al Plane also includes a second set of commonly activatable switches for functionally severing each of the Address Bus, Control Bus, Clock, Address Valid, and Configuration Latch Reset lines. Further, a third set of commonly activatable switches are included within the Segregator Functional Plane for functionally severing the input and output data lines that interconnect the Control and Array Processors.
