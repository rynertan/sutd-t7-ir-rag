# Method for increasing the boron 10 content of neutron absorbing articles and product obtained by this method.

## Abstract
A method for increasing the boron ยนโฐ content of a neut ron absorbing article, such as one in flat, flexible sheet shape, includes coating a surface of such article with a solidi fiable liquid synthetic organic polymeric material, such as a phenol formaldehyde type resin, applying boron carbide par ticles to the polymeric material and solidifying the polymer, such as by curing to cross linked permanently set form, so as to hold the neutron absorbing boron carbide particles in place thereon. In highly preferred embodiments of the inven tion the boron carbide particles applied will extend beyond the surface of the coating material and will serve as anchor ing means for applications of subsequent coatings and the plurality of coatings, usually after initial partial curing to sol idify them and make them form retaining, will be perma nently cross linked simultaneously. In another aspect of the invention the plurality of flat neutron absorbing articles may be joined together by contacting surfaces thereof with such a coating material, preferably containing boron carbide parti cles, and curing it.
