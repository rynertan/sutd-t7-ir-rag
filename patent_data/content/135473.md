# Electrode assembly for arc furnaces.

## Abstract
An arc electrode assembly comprises a water cooled metal shaft 1 and a consumable active portion 3 , being interconnected by means of a screw nipple 2 . The metal shaft 1 is surrounded below its clamping area 18 by a protective jacket 14 being detachably arranged about the metal shaft 1 . Between the jacket 14 and the metal shaft 1 a layer of electrically insulating refractory material 43 is arranged, which is cooled by the cooling system of the jacket. The protective jacket 14,30 comprises at least one steel tube 15, 15 which is provided for the passage of a cooling medium. The steel pipe s 15, 15 may additionally be surrounded by refractory or slag material 22, 26 or may directly be embedded into such material.
