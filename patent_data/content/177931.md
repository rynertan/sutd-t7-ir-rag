# Motor driving circuit.

## Abstract
A motor driving circuit includes an equivalent power PNP transistor constituted by a Darlington connection of a small current PNP transistor 3 and a large current NPN transistor 4 , and a switching regulator 2 of a step down and variable type is provided between the collector of the NPN transistor 4 and the emitter of the PNP transistor 3 . Electric power loss in the motor driving circuit can be reduc ed, and the electric power required to operate the motor driving circuit can be saved.
