# Multi function document processor.

## Abstract
A rotating polygon type laser scanning subsystem 23 is integrated with a photocopying subsystem 22 to provide a relatively high quality, economical and compact multi function document processor. To optimize the performance of the doc ument processor, the laser scanning subsystem 23 is prefer ably a symmetrical, double pass, underfilled system, and the photocopying system 22 is preferably a light lens xero graphic system. Shared optics are used to reduce the cost, complexity and size of the document processor. A half lens 25 and fixed mirror 35 are used to focus the light beams for either photocopying or laser scanning, the mirror 35 having an aperture 36 for permitting light beams to be reflected from the facets of a rotating polygon scanner 41 situated behind the mirror 35 . The rotating polygon scanner 41 is used for both raster input and output scanning, the selection being made with the aid of a flip mirror mechanism which carries an output mirror 67 .
