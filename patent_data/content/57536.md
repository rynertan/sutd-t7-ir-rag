## Description
PHARMACEUTICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS This invention relates to a group of novel compounds, their formulation as pharmaceutical compositions, and their use in the therapy of disorders. West German Offenlegungsschrift No 2,748,260.6 describes compounds of the formula A , and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof EMI1.1 wherein R1 is a C1 6 alkoxy group R2 and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, halogen, CF3, hydroxy, C1 6 alkoxy, C 2 7 acyl, amino, amino substituted by one or two C 1 6 alkyl groups, C 1 6 2 7 acyl amino, aminocarbonyl or aminosulphone optionally substituted by one or two t 6 alkyl groups, q alkylsulphone or nitro groups X is either a nitrogen atom, in which case m n is 3 to 5, m is 2 to 4 and n is 1 to 3 or X is CH in which case m n is 2 to 5, m is 1 to 5, and n is O to 4 . p is O to 3 and R4 is hydrogen, C1 6 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C16 alkyl, either of which phenyl moiety may be substituted by 6 alkyl, C16 alkoxy, CF3 or halogen, and R5 is hydrogen or R4 and R5 are attached to two adjacent carbon atoms and form together with these two carbon atoms a fused benzene ring, which benzene ring may be substituted by C16 alkyl, C16 alkoxy,CF3 or halogen as dopamine antagonists having use in the treatment of disorders of the gastro intestinal function and or in the treatment of emesis. A novel class of compounds has now been discovered which is structurally distinct from the known compounds of the formula I and also has useful pharmacological activity, such as dopamine antagonist activity. Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of the formula I EMI2.1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein a is 3 to 5 and the R5 substituted nitrogen atom is bound to one of the CH2 a carbon atoms, and has an ethan l,2 diyl moiety linking it and the cyclic nitrogen atom R1 is a C16 alkoxy group R2 and R3 are the same or different and are hydrogen, halogen, Cm3 C17 acyl, C17 acylamino, C1 6 alkyl S O , wherein n is 0, 1 or 2, nitro, C1 6 alkoxy, hydroxy, or amino, aminocarbonyl or aminosulphonyl optionally substituted by one or two C16 alkyl groups or R1 and R2 taken together are methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy in which case R3 is any one of the groups given for R1 and R2 above R4 is hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl Cl 4 alkyl R5 is hydrogen or C14 alkyl X is an oxygen or sulphur atom or a sulphoxide group SYO p is 1 or 2 and r is 1 or 2. Suitable examples of a are 3 and 4. There must bean ethan 1,2 diyl moiety linking the two nitrogen atoms in formula I . Thus the relevant portion of formula I can be represented by the partial structures I a andEMI3.1 wherein y is 1 to 3 EMI3.2 wherein x is 2 to 4. The ethan 1,2 diyl moiety is formed by the two .. carbon atoms marked Suitable examples of the group R1 include methoxy, ethoxy and n and iso propoxy. Preferably R1 is a methoxy group. Suitable examples of R2 and R3 include the following atoms and groups hydrogen chlorine, bromine CF3 formyl, acetyl, proponyl, n and iso butyryl formylamino, acetylamino, propionylamino, n and iso butyrylamino methyl, ethyl and n and iso propylsulphone, sulphinyl or thia nitro methoxy, ethoxy and n and iso propoxy .hydroxy amino, aminocarbonyl and aminosulphonyl and amino, aminocarbonyl, and aminosulphonyl substituted by one or two methyl, ethyl, n or iso propyl groups. When R1 and R2 taken together are methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy, they are most suitably ethylenedioxy. Particuarly suitable R2 and R3 groups include hydrogen, halogen and amino and acylamino and nitro, which can also conveniently be converted to the corresponding amino groups. It is generally preferred that R2 is in the 4 position relative to the carbonyl side chain, for greater activity in the resultant compound of the formula I . For the same reason, it is generally preferred that R3 is in the 5 position relative to the carbonyl side chain. Particularly preferred R2 groups include 4 amino and 4 acylamino. Most preferably R2 is 4 amino. Particularly preferred R3 groups include 5 halo, such as 5 chloro. In other useful compounds R2 is hydrogen, 4 halo eg chloro , or amino and R3 is 5 C1 6 alkyl S n such as 5 methylsulphonyi, .shinyl or thio or 5 optionally alkylated aminosulphonyl. R4 may substitute any carbon in the X containing ring apart from the bridgehead carbon , but preferably substitutes the carbon atom adjacent the nitrogen atom. Suitable examples of R4 include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl, nand iso propyl, phenyl and benzyl. Phenyl groups in R4 may be substituted by one or more C14 alkoxy such as ethoxy , C1 4 alkyl such as methyl , fluoro, chloro or CF3 Often R4 will be hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl.or phenyl. Most suitably R4 is hydrogen or methyl. Suitable ex rles of R5 include hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl. More suitably R5 is hydrogen or methyl, preferably hydrogen. Generally X is most suitably oxygen. The X is SiO group has been referred to above as the sulphoxide group. The skilled chemist will appreciate that in naming a compound containing such a S9O group, the group can be referred to as oxuhia , and indeed this terminology has been used in some Examples. Preferably p is 1. Preferably r is 1. It will be appreciated that the bond between the R5 substituted nitrogen atom and the ring carbon atom to which this nitrogen atom is joined in the compounds of formula I may be equatorial or axial. Alternatively, the hydrogen, at the ring junction with trans fusion is defined as equatorial a, and the junction of the R substituted 5 nitrogen atom is defined as a if on the same side or P if on the opposite side of the plane of the azabicyclic system to this hydrogen. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of the formula I include acid addition salts with conventional acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, lactic and acetic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula I also include quaternary ammonium salts. Examples of such salts include salts with compounds such as R6 Y wherein R6 is C16 alkyl, phenyl C1 6 alkyl or C5 7 7 cycloalkyl, and Y is an and Yis c anion of an acid. Suitable examples of R6 include methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl and benzyl and phenyl ethyl. Suitable examples of Y include the halides such as chloride, bromine and iodide. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include internal salts such as N oxides. From the aforesaid it will be seen that suitably the moiety of formula 11 EMI5.1 in a compound of the formula I will have the structure III EMI6.1 From the aforesaid it will also be appreciated that preferably the moiety of formula IV EMI6.2 in the compound of formula I is of the formula V EMI6.3 Thus a preferred sub group of compounds within formula I is of formula V EMI7.1 In formula VI suitably R4 may be hydrogen or methyl. Another preferred sub group of compounds within formula I is of formula VII EMI7.2 wherein X is S or S O, preferably S. Also in formula VII suitably R4 may be hydrogen or methyl. In In the formulae VI and VII a is most suitably 3 or 4. It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formula 1 have chiral centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number of steroisomeric forms. The invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms, including enantiomers, and to mixtures thereof including racemates . The different steroisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods such as treatment with a chiral acid followed by chromato graphic or fractional crystallisation separation, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process compriese reacting an acid of the formula VIII EMI8.1 or a reactive derivative thereof, with a compound of the formula IX EMI8.2 wherein the variable groups are as defined in formula I and thereafter if desired or necessary converting a group R2, R3 or X in the thus formed compound to another group R2, R3 or X respectively. Reactive derivative when used herein means a derivative of the compound VIII which can be reacted with the compound IX to form an amido linkage between the acid group of the compound VIII and the amino group of the.corpound of the formula IX . Often this reactive derivative will be the acid halide, such as the acid chloride, of the acid VIII .In such cases the reaction will normally be carried out in an inert solvent, preferably in the presence of an acid acceptor. The inert solvent can be any solvent inert to both reactants, such as benzene, toluene, diethyl ether or the like. The acid acceptor is suitably an organic base such as a tertiary amine, e.g.triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, or an inorganic acid acceptor, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or the like.It should be noted also that it is possible to use certain acid acceptors as the inert solvent, for example organic bases. Another useful reactive derivative of the acid VIII that may be used is an ester, such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl ester, in which case theigaction is normally carried out by heating the reactants together in an inert solvent such as ethylene glycol. The reaction may also be carried out by forming an anhydride of the acid VIII in the usual manner, and reacting that with the compound IX normally .a conventional mixed anhydride will.be used or by reacting the acid VIII and the compound IX in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. As stated previously in the compound of the formula I the linkage between the NR5 moiety and the cyclic side chain may be equatorial or axial .A mixture of equatorial and axial isomers of the compound of the formula I may be synthesised non stereo specifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom, e.g. by chromatography or alternatively the equatorial or axial isarer may if desired be synthesised from the corresponding form of the compound of the formula IX . A mixture of the equatorial and.axial isatrs of the compound of the formula IX may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom e.g. by chromatography.However, in this case it is generally more convenient to react the mixture to give a mixture of equatorial and axial isomers of the compound of the formula I and to separate these if desired as hereinbefore described. Alternatively, a given isomer of the compound of the formula IX may be synthesised stereospecifically. The compounds of formula IX may be prepared by a process which depends on whether the equatorial or axial form is desired, or a mixture thereof. To prepare equatorial compounds of formula IX , a compound of formula X is reduced EMI11.1 This reduction is suitably carried out by a dissolving metal reduction, for example with sodium and amyl alcohol.Any minor proportion of the undesired axial isomer also produced as a side product may be separated in conventional manner, for example by chromatography. Alternatively, reduction of the compound of formula X with lithium aluminium hydride gives a mixture of equatorial and axial isomers, from which mixture if so desired the axial isomer can be separated conventionally. Compounds of formula X may themselves be prepared from a compound of formula XI by reaction with hydroxylamine EMI11.2 This reaction is suitably carried out with pyridine and hydroxylamine hydrochloride at reflux temperature. The compounds of formula XI may be prepared by the Dieckmann cyclisation of a compound of formula XII EMI12.1 wherein x and y are as defined in formula CI and a,. 1b above, but in formula XII there is the necessary proviso that when x is 2 to 4, y is 0, and when y is 1 to 3, x is 1 and W and Y are both esters, such as C14 alkyl esters for example ethyl esters , or one or both of W and Y are nitriles. Suitable conditions for this reaction are standard, for example potassium tert butoxide in diethyl ether at room temperature followed by acid hydrolysis with a dilute mineral acid, such as hydrochloric acid. Compounds of the formula XII may be prepared by the alkylation of a compound of formula XIII EMI12.2 wherein Z is an ester, hydroxy or nitrile function with a suitably substituted alkyl halide. After this reaction a Z hydroxy can be converted into Y in formula XIV by conventional methods, for example by reaction with thionyl chloride followed by substitution with a metal cyanide, normally sodium cyanide. The compounds of formula XIII are either known compounds or may be prepared from known compounds in conventional manner. The aforesaid processes of course yield a compound of the formula IX wherein R5 is hydrogen. If a compound of formula IX wherein R5 is alkyl is desired, it may.simply be prepared from the corres ponding R5 is hydrogen compound by alkylation. This may be effected in any suitable manner, for example by acylation with an anhydride followed by reduction with lithium aluminium hydride. The compounds of formulae IX to XII are believed to be novel compounds, and as intermediates form an important part of this invention. The acid addition salts of compounds of the formula 1 may be prepared in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with the chosen acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared in conventional manner for such salts, such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with a compound R6Y as defined. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent such as acetone, methanol, ethanol or dimethyiformamide at ambient or raised temperature and pressure. The N oxides of the compounds of formula I may be prepared in conventional manner, for example by treatment with a per acid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid. The interconversion of suitable groups R2 and R3 after formation of a compound of the formula I or corresponding intermediate therefor may be carried out by conventional methods. By way of example nitrogroups may be reduced two amino groups in the normal manner, and acylamino groups may be converted to amino groups also by conventional methods. Also a compound of the formula I wherein R2 or R3 is halogen can be prepared by a convential halogenation of the corresponding compound of the formula I wherein the said R2 or R3 is hydrogen.Further, compounds wherein R2 or R3 are C 1 6 alkylsulphonyl may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding C16 alkyl sulphinyl compounds and such C 1 6 alkylsulphinyl compounds may be prepared by oxidation of the corresponding C16 alkylthio compound. it will be appreciated that when X is S it may be preferable to have carried out this step on theacid VIII prior to coupling. In regard to X, X isS compounds may be oxidised to X is S 9 compounds, suitably with sodium periodate. It will be appreciated by. the skilled man that, depending on the other specific substituents in the compound of the formula I , it may not be possible to effect such oxidations on a compound of the formula I selectively. In some cases, oxidation may also form the N oxide of the bicyclic moiety. Given the specific substitution and X value desired and having decided whether the compound or its N oxide is required, the skilled man will readily ascertain whether such interconversion is desirable. In general however it is more convenient to prepare such compounds of formula I from the corresponding intermediates , avoidirg later interconversion. Accordingly it will be realised that compounds of the formula I containing a R2, R3 or X group which is convertible to another R2, R3 or X group are useful intermediates, and as such form an important aspect of the invention. As hereinbefore stated, the compounds of the formula I are dopamine antagonists. The compounds of the formula I may be used in the treatment of disorders related to impaired gastro intestinal motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux, peptic ulcer and emesis. The invention therefore also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parental administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconsitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions and the like the compositions may also be in the form of suppositories and the like. Normally, orally administrable compositions are preferred. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants, and acceptable wetting agents and the like. The tablets may.be.coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented in a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid pre parations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , preserva tives, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents, and the like. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound of the formula I and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentra tion used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives, and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the. same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions fot.use in the medical treatment concerned... It will of course be realised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described di,sorders will depend on the actual compound of, the formula I used, and also on other factors such as the seriousness of the disorder being treated. The invention further provides a method of treatment of maladies in mammals including humans comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The effective amount will depend in the usual way on a number of factors such as the nature and severity of the malady to be treated, the weight of the sufferer, and the actual compound used. However by way of illustration, unit doses will suitably contain 0.1 to 20 mgs of the compound of formula I , for example 0.5 to 10 mgs. Again by way of illustration, such unit doses will suitably be administered more than once a day, for example 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day, in such a way that the total daily dose is suitably in the range 0.01 to 10 mg kg per day. Compounds of the formula I have the ability to potentiate the effect of conventional analgesics in migraine treatment when administered concurrently with the analgesic. Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound, of the formula I and an analgesic. The compound of the formula I and the analgesic, such as aspirin our paracetamols will be present in the composition in amounts generally similar to their usual effective dose. The cdmposition can be a combination product, for example a tablet or capsule containing both a compound of the formula I and an analgesic for oral administration, or a twin pack comprising the two active ingredients made up for separate administration. The invention accordingly provides a method of treatment of migraine comprising the administration to the sufferer of a compound of the formula II and an analgesic. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of formula I and the followingDescriptions illustrate the preparation of intermediates thereto. In the Examples, of course indicates that the compound is a racemate. However, for the sake of convenience, the structural formula of only one enantiomer has been shown.

The catheter was connected to a physiological pressure transducer and pressure changes recorded on a hot wire pen recorder. In each animal a pre dose period of 40 minutes was allowed to obtain a measure of spontaneous activity. An index of activity was obtained by measur ing the average height of pressure waves during 10 minute periods. Values for 4 such periods were obtained during assessment of spontaneous activity andifor the 40 minute period after the subcutaneous administration of the compounds. Students t test was applied to the difference in average values obtained for spontaneous and post compound activity. Compounds 2 and 14 were active in this test at 1.0 mg kg sub cutaneously. Toxicity No toxic effects were observed in the te reported above.
