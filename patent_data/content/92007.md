## Description
A SHAFT SEAL The present invention relates to a shaft seal for a rotary machine and to a rotary machine incorporating a shaft sealing arrangement. More particularly, this invention relates to a sealing arrangement of the so called knife edge type which is frequently utilized in high speed rotary machinery to prevent the leakage of a fluid along a shaft where the shaft penetrates a housing of the machine. Prior art shaft sealing arrangements are discussed in United States Patents Nos. 1 861 275 2 140 356 2 352 336 2 467 955 2 478 649 3 042 417 3 256 027 and 3 870 384. Known shaft sealing arrangements have many disadvantages, particularly when they are used in high speed turbine machines. Among these disadvantages are shaft or housing wear caused by rubbing friction and a sensitivity of the sealing arrangement to shaft eccentricity or vibration. This latter disadvantage may result in leakage of fluid past the seal and can exacerbate the problem of rubbing friction within the sealing arrangement. Consequently, these conventional shaft sealing arrangements are deemed less than satisfactory for application to high speed turbine machines because of the vibration and differential thermal expansions experienced by such machines. According to one aspect the present invention provides a shaft sealing arrangement for a rotary machine having a housing with an opening through which passes a shaft, the shaft and housing being relatively rotatable, the said shaft sealing arrangement cooperating with the said housing and the said shaft so as substantially to prevent leakage of a first fluid through the said opening by generating a flow of pressurized sealing fluidythere being centrifugally responsive valve means operable to vary the rate of flow of the sealing fluid in dependence on the rotational speed of the machine. The present invention also comprehends a rotary machine incorporating such a shaft sealing arrangement. In another aspect the invention provides a rotary machine having a shaft and a housing with a shaft sealing arrangement for preventing leakage of a fluid between the shaft and the housing by generating a flow of pressurized sealing fluid from a source thereof whose pressure level is a function of the rotational speed of a shaft in which there are provided a flow path within the said shaft for communicating the flow of sealing fluid from the said source thereof to the said sealing arrangement, and a centrifugally responsive valve element within the said flow path for rotation with the shaft to control the flow of sealing fluid as a function of the rotational speed of the shaft. The present invention can also be defined as a rotary machine having a housing journaling a shaft the shaft carrying a compressor wheel which in operation of the machine discharges pressurized air to a discharge area, in which there is a seal between the housing and the shaft which is resistant to the leakage of a liquid therepast by generating a flow of pressurized air into a chamber of the machine, there being a flow path within the shaft leading from the said discharge area to the said chamber of the machine for communicating a flow of pressurized air to the latter, and centrifugally responsive valve means in the flow path for controlling the flow of pressurized air as a function of shaft rotational speed. According to a further aspect the present invention provides a rotary machine comprising a housing defining a bore a rotatable shaft received in the bore a compressor wheel mounted on the shaft for rotation therewith, the compressor wheel discharging pressurized air to a discharge area a sealing arrangement circumscribing the shaft and cooperating therewith and with the housing to resist leakage therepast of a liquid in response to a flow of pressurized air into a chamber of the said machine, a flow path within the shaft putting the compressor discharge area in communication with the chamber of the sealing arrangement for supplying the flow of pressurized air to the latter and centrifugally responsive valve means carried by the shaft for controlling the flow of pressurized air as a function of shaft rotational speed. The invention can be put into practice in various different ways, but several embodiments thereof will now be more particularly described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a longitudinal sectional view of a turbine machine according to one preferred embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged fragmentary view of the encircled portion of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a fragmentary cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a cross sectional view similar toFigure 3 and showing parts of the invention in an alternative operative position. Figure 5 is a fragmentary cross sectional view similar to Figure 3, illustrating an alternative embodiment of the invention Figure 5A illustrates a component part of the embodiment of the invention shown in Figure 5 Figure 6 is a side view of a component part of another embodiment of the invention Figure 6A is a cross sectional view taken along line 6A 6A of Figure 6 and Figures 7 and 7A illustrate fragmentary views of another alternative embodiment of the invention and are similar to Figures 2 and 4. Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates a turbine machine 20 having a housing 22 comprising a first part 24 and a second part 26 which are connected by a plurality of circumferentially spaced struts 28 only two of which are visible in Figure 1 . The two parts 24 and 26 of the housing cooperate to define an annular air inlet 30 leading first radially inwardly and leading then generally axially to a centrifugal compressor wheel 32. The compressor wheel 32 and a radial inflow turbine wheel 34 are carried by a shaft assembly 36. A pair of bearings 38 and 40 carry the shaft assembly 36 and are in turn received in a bore 42 formed in the first housing part 24. When the compressor wheel 32 is rotated it draws atmospheric air in through the inlet 30 and discharges pressurized air to an annular discharge chamber 44 formed within the second part 26 of the housing. This chamber 44 communicates with a combustor 46 only a portion of which is visible in Figure 1 which receives pressurized air from the chamber 44 and fuel via a conduit 48 to maintain combustion producing a supply of hot pressurized combustion products. An annular chamber 50 within the chamber 44 receives the combustion products from the combustor 46 and directs them to the turbine wheel 34. An inner, circumferentially extending wall 52 of the part 26 of the housing defines an exhaust duct 54 leading from the turbine wheel 34 to the atmosphere. When the machine 20 is operating, combustion products from the chamber 50 cause the turbine wheel 34 to turn at high speed. The turbine wheel 34 drives the shaft assembly 36, which in turn drives the compressor wheel 34. The shaft assembly 36 includes a splined end portion 56 for connection with a powerabsorbing device not shown . Turning now to Figure 2, it will be seen that the compressor wheel 32 is formed at a radially inner location with an axially extending annular recess 58.The part 24 of the housing includes a generally cylindrical or tubular part 60 which extends axially into the recess 58. A sleeve like seal member 62 is carried by a generally cylindrical radially innermost central portion 64 of the comprsssor wheel 32. The sleeve like seal member 62 forms part of the shaft assembly 36 and the radially outer surface 66 of this sleeve member 62 is spaced radially inwardly from the tubular part of the casing part 24 and has several circumferentially extending and axially spaced knifeedge seal elements 70A to 70F extending radially outwardly towards a tubular member 68 of abrasion resistant material carried on the radially inner surface of the tubular part 60.The knife edge seal elements 70A to 70F and the tubular member 68 together define a series of adjacent but axially separated annular chambers 72A to 72E, separated that is from each other by the knife edge seal elements 70A to 70F, but are in fluid communication with one another because of a slight radial clearance between the knife edge elements 70A to 70F and the tubular member 68. As can be seen in Figure 2 the compressor wheel 32 and the turbine wheel 34 are axially spaced from one another and each defines an annular shoulder, 74 and 76 respectively, which face one another. An annular seal member 78 is located by the shoulders 74, 76, this seal having two radially outwardly projecting annular ribs constituting knife edge seals. The housing 22 also includes an annular partition member 80 extending radially inwardly between the compressor wheel 32 and the turbine wheel 34 and serving to prevent the flow of pressurized air from the compressor 32 to the turbine 34 except by way of the combustor 46. The partition member 80 has an enlarged radially inner rim 82 to which an annular element 84 of abrasion resistant material is secured, which sealingly cooperates with the seal member 78.In the lower part of the seal member 78 as viewed in Figure 2 it has a notch 88 opening from the side of partition member 80 facing the compressor wheel 32 and leading to an annular chamber 90 between the turbine wheel 34 and the compressor wheel 32 radially inwardly of the shoulders 74, 76. The notch 88 communi cates with the chamber 44, into which the compressor 32 discharges, via an annular clearance space 92 between a back face 94 of the compressor wheel 32 and the partition member 80. A radially inner annular passage 96 leads from the chamber 90 to an annular chamber 98 defined by a circumferential groove 100 on the shaft 36. A radially extending passage 102 leads from the chamber 98 into an annular chamber 104 defined by an annular recess 106 in the radially inner face of the seal member 62.A radially extending passage 108 in the seal member 62 itself puts the chamber 104 into communication with the central chamber 72C of the set of chambers 72A to 72E separated by the knife blade seals 70A to 70E. Referring now to Figure 3, it will be seen that a curved valve element 110 is disposed within the annular chamber 104. The valve element 110 comprises a length of resilient strip material, such as spring steel, one end portion 112 of which is bent to extend radially inwardly towards the shaft 36. The valve element 110 is secured to the sealing member 62 adjacent the end portion 112, such as by spot welding. The normal shape of the valve element 110, when unstressed, is the spiral shape shown in Figure 3, in which the end 114 of the strip is resiliently biased against and rests upon the bent end portion 112. Consequently, the remaining portion 116 of the valve element 110, intermediate the two ends, is spaced away from the seal member 62 so that the passage 108 is substantially unobstructed. Now, when the machine 20 is in operation at normal speed, the shaft assembly 36 rotates at high speed.Consequently, centrifugal force acting upon the valve element 110 causes this to be urged radially outwardly into engagement with the seal member 62, as illustrated in Figure 4. In this position of the valve element 110, a flow restricting metering orifice 118 formed in the valve element 110 becomes aligned with the radial passage 108 in the seal element 62 so that only a reduced flow of pressurized air from the compressor wheel 32 can pass into the chamber 72C. The pressurized air reaches the chamber 72C through the space 92, the notch 88 in the annular seal 78, the chamber 90, the passage 96, the chamber 98, the passage 102, the chamber 104, the metering orifice 118, and finally the radial passage 108 in the seal element 62.From the central chamber 72C, the pressurized air flows in both axial directions via the clearances between the knife edge seal elements 70A to 70E and the sleeve 68. The pressurized air flowing to the right as seen inFigure 2 from the chamber 72C escapes eventually into the low pressure area in the inlet 30 upstream of the compressor wheel 32. Similarly, pressurized air flowing to the left as seen in Figure 2 from the chamber 72C flows into a chamber 120 within the bore 42 in the housing part 24.The chamber 120 is supplied with a flow of lubricating oil during operation of the machine 20 to cool and lubricate the bearings 38 and 40. The pressurized air flowing from the chamber 72C past the knife edge elements 70A to 70C and into the chamber 120 prevents the lubricating oil in the chamber 120 from being drawn into the low pressure area of the inlet 30. From the chamber 120, the lubricating oil and air are scavenged by means not shown to an oil sump also not shown where the air is separated from the oil and vented. The size of the orifice 118 is selected to allow an appropriate and predetermined air flow rate from the compressor wheel 32 to the chamber 72C at normal design speed operation of the machine 20. Thus, leakage of lubricating oil into the inlet 30 is prevented while minimizing the amount of pressurized air bled from the compressor wheel for this purpose. During start up, and when the machine 20 is running after shut off, the compressor wheel 32 maintains a low pressure at the inlet 30, even though it does not develop its maximum design pressure because it is operating below its design speed. As a result, the small orifice 118, if it were permanently operative, would only allow an insufficient air flow from the compressor wheel 32 to chamber 72C so that leakage of lubricating oil into the inlet 30 would be possible.This situation is avoided, however, by the valve element 110 the weight and resilience of which are selected so that the valve element moves from its position illustrated in Figure 4 to that illustrated in Figure 3 as the machine slows down. Thus, at lower machine speeds the full flow area of the passage 108 is made available for air flow into the chamber 72C. As a reult, a sufficient air flow is maintained into the chamber 72C to prevent oil leakage despite the lower air pressure supplied by the compressor wheel 32. Likewise, during start up of the machine 20, the valve element remains in the position illustrated in Figure 3, to allow air flow through the full area of passage 108 during the initial low speed operation of the compressor wheel 32 as the machine runs up to its design speed. At a certain speed, the resilience of the valve element is overcome by centrifugal force and the valve element then moves to the position illustrated in Figure 4 to prevent an excessively high air flow to the chamber 72C. An alternative embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 5 and 5A, wherein features analogous to those described above in relation toFigures 1 to 4 are identified with the numerals used previously but increased by 200. From Figures 5 and 5A it will be seen thataa curved valve element 310 is disposed within a chamber 304 from which leads a radial passage 308. The valve element 310 comprises a strip of resilient material, a developed view of which is shown in Figure 5A, which is curled into an approximately circular shape, as seen in viewing Figure 5, and secured to a seal member 262 at two locations 122, such as by spot welding. The valve element 310 has a central portion 124 and a pair of opposite end portions 126.The end portions 126 define the securing locations 122.A pair of serpentine shape resiliently elastic sections 128 connect the central portion 124 to the end portions 126 to allow for relative movement therebetween. As can be seen in Figure 5, the valve element 310 in its unstressed position is disposed with its central portion 124 spaced from the passage 308 so that the full area of the passage 308 is available for the flow of pressurized air. When the rotational speed of the shaft assembly 336 is above a certain predetermined speed, however, the centrifugal force overcomes the resilience of the serpentine sections 128 so that the central portion 124 is urged radially outwardly into engagement with the seal member 262, as is illustrated in broken outline in Figure 5 . The central portion 124 has a flow limiting metering orifice 318 which is in alignment with the passage 308 when the valve element 310 is in its radially outward position, whereby to restrict the flow of pressurized air through the passage 308 when the speed of the shaft assembly 336 is above the said certain predetermined speed. When the rotational speed of the shaft assembly 336 decreases below the said certain predetermined speed, the serpentine resiliently elastic sections 128 pull the central portion 124 away from the passage 308 to allow an increased air flow at the lower shaft speeds. Figures 6 and 6A illustrate another embodiment of the invention in which a valve element 510 has a similar shape to the corresponding valve element in the embodiment of Figures 1 4. However, the valve element 510 is channel or U shape in cross section as illustrated in Figure 6A throughout most of its length.The valve element 510 operates in the same manner asthe valve element 110 of Figures 1 4. However, the valve element 510 offers a higher ratio of spring rate to mass so that the valve element 510 moves between its two alternative positions at a higher rotational speed than the valve element in the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4. Thus, the configuration of valve element 510 is particularly appropriate for use in machines having a very high design operating speed. Figures 7 and 7A illustrate a further embodiment of the invention in which a valve element 710 has a shape similar to that of the valve element 110 in the embodiment of Figures 1 4 and to element 510 of Figures 6 and 6A.However, the valve element 710 operates slightly differently from these in order to obtain a high operating speed whilst nevertheless using a flat rather than channel cross sectional shape for the valve element 710.As can be seen in Figure 7A, the valve element 710 is formed of flat strip material like the element 110 ofFigures 1 4, but a portion 130 of the valve element 710 which is delimited by an arc the ends of which are indicated by the arrows A in its normal that is unstressed shape has a radius of curvature which is larger than the radius of curvature of the recess 706. Consequently, a free end 132 of the valve element 710 contacts the radially inner surface of the seal member 662. When the shaft assembly 736 is rotating, the portion 130 of the valve element 710 resists the centrifugal force like a simple beam albeit, a curved simple beam which is constrained at its right end as viewed in Figure 7 and slidably supported at its left end again as viewed in Figure 7 . When the shaft assembly 736 reaches a certain predetermined speed, the valve element 720 shifts to the stressed position illustrated in broken outline inFigure 7, in which position an orifice 718 is in alignment with a passage 708 whereby to restrict the air flow through the passage 708 which below the said predetermined speed is not restricted. When the rotational speed of the shaft assembly 736 again falls below the predetermined speed, the valve element 710 moves back to the position illustrated in solid outline in Figure 7 to allow a substantially unrestricted air flow through the passage 708.
