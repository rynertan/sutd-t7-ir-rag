## Description
A method for the production of a moulding mass, containing water glass It is known to produce moulding masses ccntaining water glass.With the conception moulding masses , in this connection, is meant shapeable or plastic masses. Even if they are, preferably, shaped by casting, they may in many a case be subjected to assume the shape of the final product in some other way, e.g. by pressing, rolling or the like. Such moulding masses have a wide field of use, for instance for the production of different kinds of objects but also as a binding means between surfaces of the most different kinds. In the production of such a moulding mass known per se, an expression which is, thus, here used in its widest sence under reference to the above mentioned fields of use and working methods, one used to proceed by removing the water or, in any case, essentially decreasing the content of water in the thick fluid solution of water glass in the form of an alcali silicate. In this way, a solid pro dct was obtained, often called water glass quartz and created either by drying out the liquid water glass or by addition of acids for changing its pH value and, thereby, dissolving the alcalic milieu.Thus, it has happened that a sodium hexa fluoride was added as curing means, this medium being water consuming and also influencing the pH value in the said direction. Su h a moulding mass may be provided by adding, during its process of curing or immediately before same, another material, for instance in a way known pr se quartz meal calcium silicate, Si02 , whereby a mass, more or less homogenuous is formed, in which the PBrtJC1Pd cf the additional material are bound together by the water Baes now f free of water or, as to its content of water reduced. Water glass exists as a silicate of sodium via and also as a silicate of potash K and, finally, as a mixed silicate of sodium and potash. A water glass from ammonium is a so known but it has little or no practical use. The sodium water glass is the most usual one and in the following description of the present invention, it will be described on basis of sodium water glass. This, however shall not mean that the invention should be limited to this specific kind of water glass. The product made from such a moulding mass has a very high wearing and abrading resistance. When used as a birling means it attaches extremly well to most materials, thereby als te many such materials, to which traditionally existing binding means do not show any tendency to attach. The product also gets an increased pulling rigidity and blowing rigidity, but it has not been possible to find any unitary connection between these three kinds of rigidity except for the matter of fact that the increase of the pressure rigidity is usually the most apparent one, the increase of the blow rigidity only being rather small. Several methods are also known for the production cf moulding masses of the above mentioned type having properties, which have been improved and or modified by the addition of further additional materials for the purpose of modifying their properties. The present invention regards a method for the production of a moulding mass in the sence mentioned above and of the type mentioned above by means of additions causing further essential improvements of the properties of the moulding mass, especially by the the formation of crystals in the mass being promoted, created in the reaction, and by the mass getting less sensible for the content of water in the water glass than was earlier the case. It has also proved that a moulding mass produced according to the present invention allows for an essentially wider variation of traditional additions whereby a better distribution of the specific properties of the moulding mass is ensured, which are desired to achieve by said additions. According to the invention, silika is added to the moulding mass known per se, preferably in the form of crystal meal or crystal grains and in quantities which will be apparent from the following. Silika is the traditional denomination for such silicon i pure form or in some simple compound, which originated by decomposition of some silicon compound of higher value at high supply of power, such that this silicon got in same way as applied to carbon and other elements chemically related to carbon, a chemical activity. It is not known quite sure how this activity should be explained, but a theory which is probably correct is that one or more of the electrons in the active silicon have been displaced out of their normal orbits such that an inner molekular tension was created, at the liberating of which large quantities of power were released.Under the influence of these quantities of power the active silicon may cause reactions of chemical nature which would otherwise not at all or anyway only at a limited scale exist in non activated silicon.The feed of this power usually takes place by the silicon compound being heated to a very high temperature. As a consequence of this, one will find active silicon which has been activated to a very high rate in fly ashes from the steel work industry, within which these high temperatures exist. When activated silicon is added to the moulding mass, this will change its properties in such an apparaent way, that there is a good reason to assume that a phase chemical reaction is initiated as will often be the case within the silicate chemistry. It has, however, not been possible to find out how this reaction is developing. But it is well known that reactions will appear within the silicate chemistry, which are difficult to understand and to a great extent are still enigmatic. Therefore, the present invention has been created in a purely empirical way. An essential advantage of the moulding mass according to the present invention as compared with moulding masses on basis of water glass, earlier known, perhaps with an addition of quartz Si02 is that the scope of the different types of additional material is essentially increased. In tests with a composition of this type, one also investigated the influence of an addition of finely divided cellulose alone to the vater glass and water glass mixtures, and, thereby, a lot of circumstances were found, hitherto only empirically observed, which form basis of an especially favourable embodiment of the present invention. The said continuated investigations, in first place, intended to study to what an extent you could add cellulose in finely diviied form as a dilution means in order1 in this way to get a product which would be possible to use in a magnitude of cases but which would, due to the cheap dilution material, be produced at very low costs.Surprisingly, it was found that the product got unexpected and in many cases extremly usefull properties, fzr which account will begiven below. Mixing in neutral or basic cellulose proved to be less advantagemus, but, on the contrary, it proved that wekly acid cellulose caused the properties mentioned above in the final product. Investigations were also made for stating the type of an acid by means of which the acid properties of the mass after mixing in finely divided cellulose were obtained, and thereby it was found, that bark meal gave a very favourable result. Bark meal contains small quantities of tannic acid.Further, very good results were obtained at use of so called zero fibers, this means fibers of cellulose of such a small size, that when dewatering, they pass through the wire and are removed along with the flue water. These fibers, always, contain given residues of the acid or acids, resp., used at the cellulose cook ng, in first place sulfurous acid but also many other acids. In general, these acids appear at very small quantites or, if they appear at greater quantities, they should be weakly active, such as is the case for instance with tannic acid and sulfurous acid. An essential improvement of the invention, thus, consists in adding to the composition of water glass and silika an acidly reacting cellulose material in finely divided form and at an amount, which proved in the investigations made to be between 5 and 75 percent of weight of the total weight of the composition. In the said tests, it also proved that you could add to the moulding mass according to the invention different plastic emulsions in the form of such polymerizations products not yet cured or only partly cured. The curing of them or the fullfilling of the said curing only initiated, thereby, may take place simultaneously with the curing of the moulding mass after a curer has been added. In this way, a lot of different new products may be manufactured which have mainly the properties ofthepolymerization products in quantitative respect, but which have these properties at an quantitative extent, which is essentially improvod. Amongst other additional materials, which may be mixed into the moulding mass according to the present invention, the following ones may be mentioned. The moulding mass may be provided with additions of heavy materials, especially heavy metals in the form of powder, grains or granules. Amongst such metals lead and copper should be mentioned as well as alloys containing lead and or copper, e.g. brass and bronce.The power of the moulding mass to assume and accumulate heat will thereby get very high. The conduction of head fed to the moulding mass and the removal of acclmu ated heat from the moulding mass, respec tively, are simultaneously improved, causing a shortening of the inavoidable time consumed for feeding or removal of a given amount of heat. Further, the moulding mass may be expanded to a higher degree than was earlier possible, still maintaining its rigidity, and, thereby the expansion may be effected in may different ways. For instance, some suitable tenside may be mixed into the mass in presence of air, or one may add to the moulding mass some plastic, expanding under the influence of heat, such as poly styrene or poly uretane and thereafter heat the moulding mass before it has get cured all through. A suitable temperature at addition of poly styrene, for instance is 900 C. It was mentioned above that one could mix in cellulosic material in finely divided form in acid milieu. If one would not estimate the advatages emanating thereby1 one may mix in the cellulosic material on basic milieu. Thereby, the cellulosic material preferably is zero fibers which are added along with bi carbonate to the moulding mass according to the present invention, preferably after it has been allotted a somewhat weaker consistency by the addition of a plastic. It is not only possible to mix the moulding mass according to the invention with many different plastics but also with other materials such as asphalt and latex, preferably when said materials are in emulsion. Said materials will give to the moulding mass improved property as binding means. Due to this improved binding property when the moulding mass is used as a bindning means, it will also be especially well adapted for re inforcement purposes. Such re inforcement may be effected with good results by meons of re inforcement materials wich were earlier regarded less suitable. Often, just these materials for re inforcement are very cheap causing that one may provide a product, comparable with earlier known re infoced materials at much lower costs.When working with a moulding mass according to the present invetion it has been found that the curing takes place beginning at the outer surface of the mass such that a skin is formed, which is Flastically shapeable and very tough, the mass inside of this skin initially being plastically shapeable to a higher degree with a power thereafter to retain its shape.Thereafter, one may by pressing, rolling or the like give to a quantity of said mass a given shape, which it will, thereafter, retain during the continuation of the curing. This matter of fact may, for instance, be used when impressing a pattern or a relieff into the surface of bodies of the mass according to the invention. Amongst the advantages of the invention, there should also be mentioned that it will provide much a better fire protection when used in a way which is earlier known from usual water glass based building products, for instance as a cover on fire dangerous building parts. Therefore, it has been possible, in construction details, which have been covered with a moulding mass according to the present invention, to mix in larger quantites of otherwise fire dangerous materials such as saw dust, turf and other organic materials or asphalt emusion, without decrease of the fire protecting properties. The fire protecting properties also cause that the moulding mass according to the invention will be suitable as a binding means in the production of laminar materials, especially plates for building purposes where one was, earlier, adviced to different types of glue which had either a bad attachment power or were rather strongly apt to burn. Intricate investigations in connection with the present invention, thus, have been made in order to state the quantity of silika active silicon in pure form or in the form of a simple compound in relation to the quantity of water glass, perhaps with an addition of quartz. Thereby, it has proved that the specific properties concerned of the water glass composition according to the invention exist at an addition of silika such that the part of silika calculated as the weight of Si, of the dry weight of the sum of silicon, waterglass and quartz eventually added will be between 3 and 5 percent of weight. The quantitytof silika should not be less than 3 percent of weight because, in such a case, it would not be sufficient for providing the said and above further described advantageuous effects, nor should it be less than 5 percent of weight because, in such a case, would the rigidity be less without the surplus of silika causing any observable improvement of the above mentioned properties of the moulding mass. The best result is obtained if the part of silika is between 3.6 and 4.5 percent of weight or, with other words, about 4 percent of weight. In the tests mentioned above with intermixing finely divided cellulose, especially zero fibres from the paper and pulp industry, it further proved that such an intermixing in basic milieu was, certainly, advantageous in given respects but in other respects it was less favourable. But it also proved that mixing in cellulosic material in acid milieu in the way mentioned above would give a very favourable result. Such an intermixing did not affect the fire safety and the product, still, appeard as flame safe and fire safe.At a small addition of of the acid cellulose, one could certainly retain a weak flame under strong formation of soot but when the amount of cellulose was increased, one got complete flame safety of the product and if the combustion was retained by an outer source of fire in the way mentioned above, and, thereafter the source of fire was removed, then the fire immediately extinguished. Another apparent property of the product produced was its elasticity, which did not seem to affect its draw rigidity. Products of high elastic shapeability without any risk for breakage find use for many different purposes where one had, earlier, no cheap material available. The most important property of the product concerned, however, is its cheap production costs. Mainly, it comprises materials, which were earlier regarded not only as useless but even as hatm ful and, unfortunately, impossible to use for any usefull purposes.Then, it must be regarded extremly desirable to find a useful application of these materials. It is such an application which has been made possible according to the present invention. To this adds that the final product gets favourable properties without, simultaneously, being more expensive. Rather, it may be produced in a cheaper way. In the investigations forming basis of the present invention, it further proved that the degree of acidity pH of the cellulosic material used is of decisive importance. At to low a value of pH the advantageous properties given account for above will not show up in the product manufactured from the moulding mass, and, at too high a value of pH the curing will take place so quickly, that there will not be sufficient time available for controlling the run of the production, and the shaped body produced will also get brittle and fragile. This means, therefore, if one causes by choice of the value of pH that seemingly the curing would take place slowlier than would be desirable with respect to the demand for a rational production, this will not mean a difficulty, which cannot be tolerated.It is only required to add to the curer an accelerator and as such an accelerator preferably some suitable phosphor compound is used, e.g.ammonium phosphate. Further, in the production of objects under addition of cellulosic material in acid milieu, the curing may take place by means of electric alternating current flowing through the mass, whereby one will get a very effective means for controlling the speed of curing. Extensive investigations, therefore, ve been made for finding the limit values of the pH of the acid cellulose. These investiga tions have proved that the pH should be between 2 and 6. If the pH is less than 2 or more than 6, you will not get a perfect product.Usually it would even not be possible to use. When intermixing the cellulosic material in the form of zero fibres from the sulphate industry, one will immediately get good results. If, on the contrary, the zero fibers are collected from the sulphite industry, a given difficulty may arise. As a matter of fact, the zero fiber material from the sulphite industry is usually so strongly acid when leaving the wire that it will, at this time certainly be within the limits for the pH mentioned above, but the said material will usually not be in this state. The reason of this difficulty is that the zero fiber material was, hitherto, regarded a harmful product, and, therefore it was washed away through existing out lets to adjacent water courses along with the waste water lye water from the wire , but this caused an acidification of the water course and in some cases of the ground water.Therefore, it was regarded dangerous to the milieu and prescriptions were given which made it necessary to deacidify the zero fiber material, e.g. by addition of lime CaO in specific inter storing bassins. By this step, however, the zero fiber material available in trade to be used for the purpose of the present invention, from the cellulose industry and in first paace from the sulphite cellulose industry was brought, as to its pH, outside of the limit values which it should possess according to the present invention. This disadvantage, therefore, had do be done away with before one could add zero fiber material to a moulding mass of the present type. In practice, this is made by acidification of the zero fiber material before it is adde to the water glass. Thos may take place by addition of adapted quantities of an acid, and, in practice, thereby only sulfuric acid will be used. Zero fiber material from the sulphite pulp industry has proved to be the better one, but it was also possible to use zero fiber cellulose from the sulphate pulp industry. However, it proved that the acidity of the last mentioned fiber is sometimes to high, because it is derived from the strong sulfuric acid H2S04 . For some purposes, nevertheless it could be used, but not in its existing state if ot was collected directly from the wire, and, in such a case, it had to be de acidifyed. The type of the cellulosic material added is not of decisive importance. The reason why we have, above, especially mentioned zero fiber material from the cellulose industry, and thereby in first place from the sulphite and sulphate pulp industry, simply is that this material is a non desired by product and that, therefore, a useful use of it has been of value by the consequent decrease of damages of the milieu. Another waste product which is not desirable, however is bark, even if the damages of the milieu from bark are of a rather subordinated importance, because the bark will slowly and in a natural way be the subject of a decomposition turning over into wood mould. But bark is also a material for which it is desirable to find a useful use and, for this reason, investigations have been made in connection with the creation of the present invention using finely divided bark meal.Bark meal comprises when collected from pine wood, quantities of tannic acid, which will rather well correspond to the demands according to the present invention. Usually, therefore, no adjustment of the pH is necessary. It was mentioned above that the qliÅalititJ of ce i diOSic material added may vuriUd within rather wide limits, and, as such limit values were indicated between 5 and 75 percent of weight, in both cases to be calculated on basis of the dry weight of the total of the mass contained in the composition.This variation of the amount cf cellulose causes a strong variation of the properties of the mStr a produced. 1 low content of cellulose will, contrary to what one would assume, the rigidity of the produced objects be less, but simultaneous ly a very light product is obtained having exceedingly good properties of elastically returnable power of changing its hape. The rigi1 successively increases with increase of the amount of the water glass based initial material, but the power of elastic return of shape simltanesously will be less, however only slowly.Even at the highest content of cellulosic material proposed of 75 percent uf weight will ttiis elastic power of return be remarkably strong. Of course, however, the product will be heavier, the greater the quantity of the initial material contained in the product is and the less the quantity f cellu osic material is. The above mentioned properties of a product from the compsi tion according to the invention has as its result that this composition mar advantageuously be used in the production cf many different types of objects. Amongst such objects allready above have been men tioned heat accunulators, wieceby it was provided that a heavy metal is introduced in the mass such as lead or coppar.Both lead and copper are rather expensive, and if it desired to btlild up an accumulator f heat at lower costs even if with less effectivity, one may instead of these metals use some other material within the group which used to be called brown material and in which such materials as soapstone, felspar, serpentine and olivine are contained. The composition according to the invention further is especially suitable for the production of building materials in thefcrm of plates for use in such cases when, earlier, gypsum plates r coke slag plates or the like were used. The use of the moulding mass according to the invention, however, shall not be limited to these fields of use. Independently of if cellulosic material has been added or not, and also, when using cellulosic material, independently of if this took place in basic or in acid milieu, tests hae also been made with an addition of different polymerization products. Thereby, it has proved that the advantages mentioned above will exist independently of what polymerization product is used as a filler for the purpose of giving the final product the specific properties.In these tests, however, a curiosity could be observed for which one could not find a reliable explanation.Adding to the water glass composition according to the invention chosen parts of two different polymerization products, e.g, a phenolic plastic and an acrylic plastic, or an epoxy plastic and an acrylic plastic, one will get a final product which will not only possess the qualitative properties of the two initial polymerization products in combination, but these will appear in a form, which is quantatively stronger. As an example, it may be mentioned that one may use the water glass composition according to the invention for improving the action of the properties which acrylic plastics have as well as those which epoxy plastics have, but if both of them are added, one will get a rigidity of the ready product substantially greater than the rigidity of the composition according to the invention with an addition of only one of the two plastics. It has not been possible to find the explanation of this, but it seems to be possible that the phenomenon may depend upon some kind of a cross binding between the two plastics under influence of either water glass or, which seems to be more probable, the silika, said silika having a latent power, so that it may act as an activator catalyst. Possibly, also quarts if present may participate this probably catalytically based reaction.This last mentioned, however, is doubtful. The investigations, therefore, have been continued as far as regards two such polymerization products chosen, and due to the exact and precise properties of each polymerization product per se, it was supposed that the most reliable result would be obtained if the investigatinns were made on basis of an addition of an acrylic plastic in combination with an epoxy plastic to the water glass composition according to the invention. Thereby rigidity values were obtained, which were, certainly, a little undetermined, but which were in general about 40 percent higher than the values which could be obtained with the water glass composition according to the invention under addition of only one of the two said plastics.The matter of fact that the rigidity values were a little undetermined was supposed to depend upon the fact that, when the tests were made one had not produced the partle t the plastics with one and the same shape and ze, but this moment of uncertainity was regarded to correopond to eirel7mslan ces as they are in practice. The phenomenon was especially well observable witn n a range of between 10 and 30 percent of weight cf acrylic plastic and also between i and 30 percent of weight of the epoxy plastic, said percentages in both cases being calculated on the total of the weight of the mass.No appreciable difference could be observed if one fGr instance added one of the plastics in a quantity of 10 percent of weight and the other one in a quantity of 30 percent of weight or vice visa. But one could observe that the maximum of pressure rigidity was obtained when the plastics were added in Rlantit s which were between 15 and 25 percent of weight of the total of the dry weight of water glass and silika and the quartz perhaps present. It proved that the blow rigidity, the pressure rigidity and the draw rigidity did all increase in the unexpected way mentioned above, but that the draw rigidity increased less than the two other ones.It wds not possible to find any clear answer to the question why the three types of rigidity increased at different rates. mean value of the rigidity of the three types mentioned was calculated as about 30 more than the increase of rigidity obtained when only the one or the other one of the two plastics were added t the composition of water glass and silika and perhaps quartz. This mean value, thus was a little lower than the value of 40 mentioned above. Below, some examples of the use of the invention will oe given All of them have been tested and have been fount in an extensive rate to satisfy the desire about the advantages given account for. Example 1 This example regarded the use of the composition as a binding means, more closely for use in situ at the time when a binding between two building materials is required. The composition was composed as follows Sodium water glass, dry weight 295 parts Quartz meal, dry weight 251 parts Silika flv ashes , dry weight 25 parts Curing means sodium hexa fluoride 56 parts The composition gave a very good binding effect, also on materials to which water glass alone as well as other known compositions of water glass did not at all attach. After addition of the curing means the composition hardened within a time of less than ten minuits.At comparative tests with a compositinnwithoutsilika but with the same quantity of curing means, the hardening took a time of at least several hours and, in some cases, up to one or more days. Example 2 This example also regarded a composition to be used as binding means, this time, however, between the laming in a laminated plate for building purposes. Also now comparative tests were made without addition of silika and it proved that the composition with silika gave a bindung effect which was 30 ,D24 stronger than the one obtained without silika. The composition was composed as follows Sodium water glass, dry weight 270 parts Silika fly ashes , dry weight 11 parts Curing means equal as in Ex 1 18 parts Amongst others it proved at the tests that the binding means attached well to window glass, to which traditional water glass based binding moans do not at all attach, or if the glass ia frosted certeinly will attach but with a non resting binding. The same applied to shiny metal surfaces. Example 3 This test intended creation of a floor cover material to be used in factory localities, where heavy vehicles are driven. The intention was to provide a sound damping cover having long duration.The composition has the following content Sodium water glass 270 parts Quartz meal 300 parts Silika 24 parts Curing means same as in Ex. 1 18 parts Same composition was also prepared leaving out the quartz meal.The two compositions were compared during completely equal circumstances. Both hardened at a time of between 8 and 12 minutes after the curing means was added. Waste oil and fats did not attach to the surface of the covered floor, which was regarded the perhaps most important advantage of this floor cover when used in a factory locality. the two tested floor covers were subjected to artifical strains in a test bank by alternating pushes snd vibrations with an intensity, calculated to corraspond to normal strains during five years. The surfaces of the floor cover containing quartz meal remained intact.The surface of the floor cover which didn t contain quartz meal after a period of time corresonding to between 4 and 5 years proved to have smaller fissures, but they were not deep. Simultaneously, the floor cover produced inclusive of quartz meal still was intact. Example 4 In this case the composition was used for production av heat accumulating bodies for a steam generator. The composition was as follows Sodium water glass 250 parts Copper granulate 750 parts Reinforcement Steel wool 40 parts Silika fly ashes 50 parts Curing means same as above 54 parts the heat accumulator bodies were heated in the steam generator to a temperature of 400 C and, thereafter, they were cooled by spraying so that their temperature sunk during the time of one second to 85 C. Earlier, one had for same purpose used heat accumulator bodies from same composition, however without the addition of silika. These heat accumulator bodies with an addition of silika proved to have a life length of avaragely eight times the one for heat accumulator bodies without silika.The heat accumulator bodies without silika, after a short time, decomposed into pieces or smaller parts, which could, in part, be called powder. Example 5 In this test building plates were produced under addition of acid cellulose material. First, a composition was produced containing sodium water glass, quartz meal and silika separately, and thereter, by means of sulfuric acid the pH of the zero fiber material from the sulfite pulp industry was adjusted, said material having been brought in a way known per se to a decreased acidity, which was insufficient for the present purpose. The pH thereby was adjusted to be equal to 4. In this case no conventional curer was used, because it proved that the acid cellulose acted as a curer.The composition was as follows Compositiofli Sodium water glass 57 parts of weight Quartz meal 6 parts Silika 2 parts In total 45 parts Cellulosic material 55 parts of weight In total 100 partsAfter the production of the composition proper, the cellulosic material was added, and the curing immediately started. This, however continued a little slowlier than in the tests 1 4. Before the curing had continued so far that the material had got stiff, and when it was still in a plastic state, so that it could be shaped, it was cast into moulds for creation of the building plates. Thereafter the curing continued until the pate was ready cured. During the end of the curing this took place rather quickly such that the material turned over from plastic consistency into the final solid one in less than ten minuites. At this time, the prcduced building plate could be removed from the mould immediately. The building plates produced had a higher rigidity than any building plates on basis of water glass earlier known. In first place, however, they proved to have a power of elastic return of any change of shape, which was very remarcable. This way, such damages could be avoided which would otherwise easily happen during transportation or mounting, and, as a consequence thereof, the mounting work could take place both easier and quicker.
