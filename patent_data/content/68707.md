# Method for providing optical patterns in glass.

## Abstract
A method of producing an optical pattern in glass comprises the step of a impregnating a porous glass article with a photolyzable organometallic compound and b exposing said article to a patterning source of photolyzing light to photolytically convert at least some of the organometallic compound in exposed areas of said glass to photolyzed intermediates which are stable against migration in the glass. Additional processing can be used to fix or visually enhance the image.
