# Noise erasing method for stimulable phosphor sheet.

## Abstract
In a radiation image recording and read out system in which a stimulable phosphor sheet 4 is repeatedly used for recording radiation images and noise due to residual radiation energy on the phosphor sheet 4 is eliminated by exposing the phosphor sheet 4 to erasing light 11 prior to the recording of a radiation image thereon, the level of residual radiation energy is determined and the amount of exposure of the phosphor sheet 4 to the erasing light 11 is controlled according to the determined level of residual radiation energy. The exposure amount is controlled to erase residual radiation energy to a level within the range between 0.01 and 0.0001 with the maximum of the originally stored radiation energy taken as 100.
