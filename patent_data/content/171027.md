## Description
The present invention relates to an optical transmitter for optical fiber communications. With the advent of low loss optical fibers, single mode semiconductor lasers such as distributed feedback semiconductor lasers hereinafter referred to as DFB LDs for brevity , high sensitivity light receiving elements such as germanium or InGaAs avalanche photodiodes hereinafter referred to as APDs for brevity , and the like, optical fiber communications over a distance of more than 100 km has recently been brought to a practicable stage. Studies are presently under way for further increasing the transmission range or the transmission rate. One of major obstructions to longer range and higher rate lightwave communications is the wavelength dispersion of optical fibers. Specifically, while in the wavelength range of 1.5 1.6 µm the transmission loss of optical fibers is minimal and long distance transmission is hopeful, the wavelength dispersion due mainly to material dispersion amounts to about 2 ps km Å 1Å 0.1 nm in that specific wavelength range. Hence, in order that transmission may be effected over a distance of the order of 100 km with a modulation rate of 2 Gb s, a light source which naturally is operable in a single longitudinal mode is essential and, yet, the spread of its spectrum width has to be restricted to about 0.8 Å. However, where a prior art DFB LD is directly modulated at a high rate, the carrier density of an active layer in the DFB LD is modulated and, therefore, the lasing wavelength is necessarily modulated wavelength chirping as generally referred to , undesirably allowing the spectrum line width to expand to about 1 2 Å. As such, where high speed transmission is desired in the wavelength band of 1.5 µm, the transmissible distance is limited by wavelength dispersion rather than by transmission loss. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an optical transmitter for optical fiber communications which allows a minimum of wavelength chirping to occur even during high speed direct modulation. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided an optical transmitter including a bistable distributed feedback semiconductor laser having hysteresis which includes a first lasing threshold value associated with a case wherein an injection current is increased and a second lasing threshold value associated with a case wherein the injection current is decreased, a bias circuit applying a bias current lower than the second lasing threshold value to the semiconductor laser, and a drive circuit applying to the semiconductor laser a current pulse having a peak which is higher than the first lasing threshold value when the current pulse is superimposed on the bias current. Before entering into detailed description of the present invention, the characteristics of a bistable DFB LD which constitutes an essential element of the present invention will be outlined. Even with a DFB LD, a bistable mode operation is attainable by defining a non injection region where no current is injected, as taught by Akiba et al in IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics. Vol. QE 19, No. 6, page 1053, issued 1983. A bistable DFB LD shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B of the drawings was manufactured for test by providing a non injection region 100 in a part of a double channel planer buried DFB LD which had been reported by Yamaguchi et al at the 1984 National Convention Record of the Institute of Electronics and Communication Engineers of Japan, Paper No. 1026. As shown in Fig. 3A, the light output of the above mentioned type of DFB LD showed a hysteresis characteristics responsive to injection current the lasing threshold current I A rectangular pulse current was applied to a bistable DFB LD having the above described characteristic to evaluate its response. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 4A, a dc bias current I The phenomenon stated above is the first revelation in conjunction with a bistable DFB LD. Such a characteristic of a bistable DFB LD is applicable to optical fiber communications. Referring to FIG. 1 of the drawings, an optical transmitter embodying the present invention is shown in a block diagram. The optical transmitter comprises a bias circuit 21 and a drive circuit 22 which in cooperation serve to activate a bistable DFB LD 20, and a coupling resistor 23 and a coupling capacitor 24. As shown in detail in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the bistable DFB LD has a mesa stripe which includes an active layer 3, a waveguide layer 4 conjugate with the active layer 3 and provided with corrugation having a predetermined period, and a cladding layer 5 which holds the waveguide layer 4 between it and the active layer 3. In addition to the layers 3, 4 and 5, the DFB LD includes an n InP confining layer 7 provided on an intermediate portion of the mesa stripe, and a P InP burying layer 8 and a cap layer 9. A voltage is applied across a positive electrode 10 and a negative electrode 11 to inject current into the active layer 3. The particular part of the active layer 3 located below the confining layer 7 defines a non injection region where current injection does not occur, so that the light output shows a bistable characteristic. The procedure for manufacturing the DFB LD 20 will be described later in detail. To evaluate the characteristics of the light transmitter shown in Fig. 1, a bias current I Transmission tests were conducted by introducing optical signals provided by the optical transmitter of the present invention into single mode fibers having a core diameter of 10 µm through an optical lens arrangement and with a coupling loss of 2 dB. A receiver used for the tests was implemented with a Ge APD having a light receiving diameter of 80 µm. The received power level of the receiver was 42 dBm for a bit error rate of 10 ¹⁰ S ¹. When optical fibers which show an average transmission loss of 0.25 dB km inclusive of splice losses of the optical fibers at the wavelength in the 1.55 µm band was used, the transmitter successfully transmitted signals over a distance of 160 km with a margin of 2 dBm. It was found that this distance is the result of limitation due to losses and not to the dispersion of the optical fibers, and that the lasing spectrum line width of signal light is restricted to a sufficiently small value. Such implies that modulating the bistable DFB LD 20 in such a manner as to traverse the hysteresis region is sufficiently effective. In this connection, when the bias current I Now, a reference will be made to FIGS. 2A and 2B for explaining the method of manufacturing the DFB LD 20. The DFB LD 20 comprises a 001 n InP substrate 1 on which are sequentially grown an n InP buffer layer 2 Sn doped, carrier density of 5 x 10¹⁷ cm ³, thickness of 3 µm , a non doped InGaAsP active layer 3 1.3 µm composition in terms of emission wavelength, thickness of 0.1 µm , and p InGaAsP guide layer 4 1.1 µm composition in terms of emission wavelength, Zn doped, carrier density of 7 x 10¹⁸ cm ³, thickness of 0.2 µm . The p InGaAsP guide layer 4 is provided with a diffraction grating 200 having a period of 200 nm and a depth of 100 nm. A p InP cladding layer 5 Zn doped, carrier density of 1 x 10¹⁸ cm ³, and thickness of 1 µm is deposited on the surface of the wafer which has been provided with the diffraction grating 200. After two parallel channels or grooves 51 and 52 have been provided at both sides of a mesa stripe 50 which is 1 2 µm thick, there are sequentially grown a p InP blocking layer 6 Zn doped, carrier density of 1 x 10¹⁸ cm ³, 0.5 µm thick in flat portion , an n InP confining layer 7 Te doped, carrier density of 3 x 10¹⁸ cm ³, 0.5 µm thick in flat portion , a p InP burying layer 8 Zn doped, carrier density of 1 x 10¹⁸ cm ³, 1.5 µm thick in flat portion , and a p InGaAsP cap layer 9 1.2 µm thick composition in terms of emission wavelength, Z doped, carrier density of 1 x 10¹⁹ cm ³, about 1 µm thick in a flat portion , thereby completing a double channel planer buried structure. Some of the layers mentioned have already been outlined in relation to the specific construction of the transmitter of the present invention. The n InP confining layer 7 is laminated exclusively on that part of the mesa stripe 50 which lies in the non injection region 100. To grown the confining layer 7 only in the limited region 100, the two channels 51 and 52 may each be narrowed in the specific region 100. In the non injection region 100, the confining layer 7 serves to prevent a current from being injected into the InGaAsP active layer 3 which is located beneath the confining layer 7. While only basic structural elements are shown in the embodiment of Fig. 1, it will be noted that a temperature control unit for controlling the operation temperature of the bistable DFB LD to a predetermined value, a light isolator for reducing the influence of light returning to the DFB LD, and others may be incorporated, if desired. It Should be born in mind that the bistable DFB LD structure and current values shown and described are merely typical examples and not restrictive in any way, that is, the present invention is applicable to any kind of DFB LDs. In summary, it will be seen that the present invention provides an optical transmitter which offers a remarkable improvement in transmissible distance over prior art transmitters. This advantage is derived from the fact that since the transmitter of the present invention is capable of generating signal pulses having a narrow lasing spectrum line width, it is free from the limitation due to wavelength dispersion of optical fibers when applied to an optical fiber communications system.
