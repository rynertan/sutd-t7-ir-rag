## Description
The present invention relates to a calcium phosphorus apatite, a process for preparing the same, and a chromatographic packing material consisting of the same. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for preparing a calcium phosphorus apatite having a controlled Ca P ratio according to a method involving fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution. The calcium phosphorus apatite of the present invention provides a spherical hydrozyapatite suitable as a packing material for high performance liquid chromatography and an apatite of submicrons in size, suitable as a raw material powder for bioceramics. Calcium phosphorus apatites have a peculiar performance as adsorbents for biopolymers, fluorine ions, heavy metal ions, etc. They have recently been regarded as being useful as a chromatographic packing material for the separation of proteins and enzymes which utilizes bioaffinities thereof. They have also attracted attention as substances capable of being used as bioceramic materials for artificial bones and teeth. There have heretofore been many known processes for the preparation of these apatites. According to a rough classification, the following processes can be exemplified. Further there is known from DE B 1 196 166 a method for producing finely divided phosphates from phosphoric acid and salts of the elements of group II of the periodic table or of aluminium wherein the phosphoric acid is mixed into a clear solution or a paste together with nitrates or chlorides soluble in the phosphoric acid and containing cations of elements of the group II of the periodic table and wherein the obtained mixture is sprayed into an inert hot gas stream of temperatures between 190 and 450 C. From DE A 1 925 823, which is an additional application to DE B 1 196 166, it is further known in the above process to add ammonium chloride or ammonia to the solution or paste prior to the spraying process in order to increase the powder density or silicofluoric acid is added in order to reduce the powder density. Columns packed with hydroxyapatite have recently been marketed. This has enabled biopolymers of 10‚Åµ daltons or more to be separated and purified, which was impossible in the past. Thus, they have been attracting attention for the industrialization of biotechnology requiring separation and purification of proteins, nucleic acids, enzymes, etc. However, prior art packing materials consisting of hydroxyapatite are low in mechanical strength, liable to be divided into fine particles, poor in the repeatability of packing properties and chromatographic properties, and also, poor in durability or have a short life spans, leading to high cost, thus presenting various disadvantages. Therefore, they have not been widely employed yet, despite their excellent properties concerning separation and purification of biopolymers. Thus, removal of their disadvantages has been seriously demanded. Specifically, since the conventional hydroxyapatite is prepared by the so called wet synthesis process, control of the Ca P ratio is difficult and removal of the phosphoric acids is insufficient, leading to disadvantages such as low resistance to strong alkalis as well as organic solvents. Atkinson et al. synthesized a hydroxyapatite by a wet hydrolysis process and reported its aptitude for chromatography A. Atkinson et al., J. Appl. Chem. Biotechnol. A raw material powder of an apatite for the preparation of a high density hydroxyapatite ceramics must be excellent in thermal stability since a molding thereof is to be sintered at high temperature. In this respect, an apatite having the same atomic ratio of calcium to phosphorus as the theoretical composition ratio is desirable. In this sense, an apatite prepared by the dry synthesis process capable of easily providing an apatite with the theoretical composition may be suitable as the raw material of ceramics. Since the apatite prepared by the dry synthesis process has already undergone the high temperature reaction for the apatite synthesis, the sintering activity of a powder thereof pulverized as the raw material of ceramic is low because of the thermal history of the apatite. Accordingly, sintering must be carried out at a higher temperature in order to obtain a dense sintered body. This is accompanied by a disadvantage in that the proportion of apatite decomposition increases with an increase in the temperature. According to U.S. Patent No. 4,097,935, a high density hydroxyapatite ceramics is obtained by forming a gelatinous precipitate of calcium phosphate in a solution having a pH of 10 to 12 by the precipitation process, and separating and sintering the same. As described above, however, the wet synthesis process is affected by a number of factors, so that difficulties are experienced in controlling the process with good repeatability. As a result of extensive investigations on the process for preparing a calcium phosphorus apatite in a simple manner with a few steps while obviating the defects of the prior art techniques as mentioned above, we have completed the present invention. According to the present invention, a process for preparing a calcium phosphorus apatite in a manner quite different from those of the above mentioned prior art techniques is provided, as well as a calcium phosphorus apatite having novel properties which is obtained according to this process. In one aspect of the present invention, the following novel process for preparing a calcium phosphorus apatite is provided. In the process of the present invention, a homogeneous mixture of raw materials is materialized by dissolving solvent soluble raw materials in a single solvent of water or an organic solvent compatible with water or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent compatible with water to prepare a raw material solution for use in the process. Therefore, the process is characterized by the absence of precipitate in the mixture. Raw material solutions to be used in the reaction of fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution in the process of the present invention are roughly classified as follows Preparation of each type of the above mentioned raw material solutions will now be specifically described. Even where an organic solvent compatible with water is used as the sole solvent in a raw material solution as mentioned in b or c , it is possible depending on the combination of raw material compounds that the reaction system becomes one of a mixed solvent of water and the organic solvent as a result of incorporation therein of the residual water, water of crystallization, or the like of any raw material compound. In any case, however, such an organic solvent can be used in the process of the present invention in so far as the raw material solution can be prepared without precipitation. According to the process of the present invention, maintenance of homogeneity of the composition from the stage of the raw material solution to the stage of the product is attained by minimizing volumes wherein segregation of the components of the solution occurs according to the process involving fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution to rapidly effect vaporization and combustion of the solvent, thereby minimizing segregation of the components in droplets of the solution. The above mentioned process according to the present invention will now be more specifically described. Calcium and phosphorus compounds both soluble in the following solvent are added to and mixed with a single solvent of water or an organic solvent compatible with water or a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent compatible with water to dissolve the whole. Thus, a raw material solution as the starting material is prepared. The order of mixing of the raw materials for the preparation of the solution is not necessarily limited to the one mentioned above. Mixing may be done in any order in so far as a solution mixture free of a precipitate can be obtained. Problems may sometimes arise, depending on the combination of calcium and phosphorus compounds and the solvent in the above mentioned raw material solution, in that difficulties may be encountered in preparing a homogeneous solution or a once prepared solution may turn turbid with lapse of time. In such a case, addition of an acid can occasionally solve the problem. Where an organic compound is used as the phosphorus compound, preliminary addition of aqueous ammonia to the solution may occasionally effectively suppress formation of any by product and liberation of CaO, and improve the yield of hydroxyapatite. Thus, an acid or aqueous ammonia may be added to the solution according to need. The mixing time is different depending on the raw materials chosen. In any way, stirring is continued until all the raw materials are dissolved to form a homogeneous solution composition. Subsequently, the solution thus prepared is atomized into a flame coming from a gas burner or the like, or into a heating zone preliminarily heated at a desired temperature falling within a temperature range capable of causing thermal decomposition of the raw material solution by means of a gas furnace, an electric furnace, or a high temperature gas according to known atomization methods using a pressure nozzle or a rotary disk which temperature is at least 710 C. In this way, the solution atomized into fine droplets of usually several microns or smaller is subjected to not only vaporization and combustion of the solvent therein but also solidification and thermal decomposition of the solute within a very short period of time of several seconds or less. Where an inflammable organic solvent compatible with water or a mixed solvent of water and an inflammable organic solvent compatible with water is used as the solvent, the combustion heat generated by combustion of the inflammable organic solvent itself can be utilized as a heat source necessary for the thermal decomposition reaction. Where the organic solvent in the mixed solvent of water and the organic solvent compatible with water is utilized without combustion thereof to promote evaporation of the mixed solvent, or where water is used as the sole solvent, a source of heat supply, such as a gas furnace as mentioned above, is needed. A combination of the combustion heat generated from the organic solvent and a heating source such as a gas furnace may be employed. A powder formed by the thermal decomposition reaction is collected by means of, for example, a cyclone system. The powders formed by the fast thermal decomposition reaction of atomized solution are various, depending on the kinds and combination of raw material compounds and the conditions of fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution, that they may consist of an amorphous phase, or may include both an apatite crystalline phase and an amorphous phase, or may contain unreacted components and or by products in addition to an apatite. In any case, they are highly reactive powders. The use of such a highly reactive powder may be desirable in some end uses of the powder or for some purposes of use of it. In other end uses or for other purposes, it may be desirable to reduce the reactivity, increase the crystallinity, and or decrease or eliminate the unreacted components and or the by products. In this case, the powder formed by the fast thermal decomposition reaction of atomized solution is heat treated in an atmosphere such as air, air containing water vapor incorporated therein, or an inert atmosphere at a desired temperature falling within a temperature range capable of allowing the apatite to stably exist without decompositon thereof to obtain an apatite controlled in various powder characteristics such as the degree of crystallinity. For example, in the case of hydroxyapatite, the above mentioned purpose can be attained by a heat treatment conducted in air at a desired temperature of 1,400 C or lower. In the case of chloroapatite, adequate choice of the conditions of preparation of the raw material solution and the conditions of fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution can provide a product, which can be converted, upon heating to a temperature in a range of 500 to 1,000 C, into calcium chlorophosphate Ca‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑCl capable of being reconverted into chloroapatite again at a temperature of 1,000 C or higher. Accordingly, also in this case, chloroapatite can be obtained by an adequate heat treatment. The apatite prepared by the process of the present invention will be described. The atomic ratio Ca P of calcium to phosphorus is 5 3 in the common calcium phosphorus apatite having a stoichiometric composition. Where the raw material solution a as mentioned above is used in the actual reaction according to the present invention, a composition of raw material solution having an atomic ratio Ca P of calcium to phosphorus of 1.60 to 1.85 always provides a product comprising an apatite as the main component. It is also confirmed through experiment that in some cases a product comprising an apatite as the main component is obtained even at a Ca P of less than 1.60 or more than 1.85, although it depends on the combination of raw materials. In the same way, a composition having an atomic ratio Ca P of calcium to phosphorus of 1.25 to 1.75, in the case of the raw material solution b as mentioned abeve, or 1.45 to 1.85, in the case of the raw material solution c as mentioned above, always provides a product comprising an apatite as the main component. It is also confirmed through experiment by the inventors of the present invention that in some cases a product comprising an apatite as the main component is obtained even at a Ca P falling outside the above mentioned range though it depends on the combination of raw materials. Thus, when the Ca P ratio is beside 5 3, some unreacted components and or by products may be incorporated in the product depending on the conditions. However, the above mentioned product is still usable in some cases since the performance thereof may be sufficient for some end uses or for some purposes. Therefore, the above mentioned product, of course, falls within the scope of the calcium phosphorus apatite according to the present invention. The powder formed by the foregoing process according to the present invention can have various forms such as a fine powder of hollow spheres, a fine powder of spheres solid up to the inside thereof, or a powder of broken spheres having various shapes, depending on the kinds and combination of raw material compounds chosen and the choice of conditions of fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution. These forms of powders can be suitably employed for various end uses in accordance with their respective characteristics such as the shape. As will be described in detail in the Examples which will be given later, a powder product of apatite particles having a spherical shape of submicrons to tens of microns can be directly prepared without any molding operation by adequately choosing the conditions of fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution, such as the rate of supply of a raw material solution, the gas atomization pressure, the rate of supply of the atomization gas, and the thermal decomposition temperature, in accordance with the kinds and combination of raw material compounds and a solvent. The spherical particles thus obtained are not only in the most desirable form for packing material particles for chromatography but also have very excellent chromatographic properties. Thus, the apatite particles having novel properties cannot only advantageously be directly prepared in the form of spheres of about several microns, unattainable by the conventional techniques, without any molding operation, but also have many excellent characteristics required of the packing material, such as excellent chemical stability, very high mechanical strength, and excellent durability because of the easy control of the Ca P ratio in the process. The spherical apatite particles of submicrons to tens of microns prepared by the above mentioned process can be used as the column packing material either as they are or after being classified for further uniformity of particle size. Since the particle shape of the above mentioned apatite is spherical, the flowability of the particles during packing thereof is so good that a bridging phenomenon, which is liable to occur when angular particles are packed, does not occur. Thus, a uniformly packed column is easily prepared only by performing packing work in accordance with the ordinary packing procedure. When spherical particles having uniform particle size and shape are packed, the packing work is not only well facilitated, but also very uniform inter particle spaces are formed by uniformly packing the apatite particles. This provides a characteristic feature of elimination of the dispersion of the inter particle spaces, which gives rise to turbulence to provide such a difference in the linear flow rate of an elute in the axial direction of a column, which constitutes one cause of reduction in the separating capacity of the column. Minimization and uniformization of the size of particles have been materialized to some extent also regarding the hydroxyapatite packing material prepared by the conventional technique. Also as for column packing, attempts to minimize the dispersion of spaces between packing material particles have been made with the greatest circumspection. Despite such efforts, the dispersion of the inter particle spaces could not have been perfectly eliminated in the hydroxyapatite packing material prepared by the conventional technique because application of a pressure high enough to realize uniform packing is impossible due to the poor mechanical strength of the packing material as well as the particle shape of the packing material which may be any one of various shapes including aggregates of fine plate crystals and aggregates of fine pillar like crystals. The fine spherical apatite prepared by the foregoing process has a practical, significant advantage in that packing work and handling of a packed column are very well facilitated since it has such a very high mechanical strength that the densely packed particles thereof are not broken even under a packing pressure of, for example, 500 kg cm¬≤. An increase in the separating capacity in column chromatography can be materialized by strictly minimizing the particle size of the packing material. However, packing of minute particles entails narrower inter particle spaces in the column, which results in a marked reduction in the flow rate. This problem is actually solved by a method in which the flow rate is increased by application of high pressure to the column. This results in the application of a considerable pressure to the packing material. Therefore, when the mechanical strength of packing material particles in use is low, packed particles are broken and hence pulverized during packing and or measurement work to cause blocking of the column, which shortens the life span of the column. As opposed to the conventional hydroxyapatite disadvantageously consisting of aggregates of fine plate crystals and hence being liable to collapse, the packing material according to the present invention consists of particles having a very high mechanical strength. Thus, the above mentioned problem can be solved at a stroke. The apatite used in the present invention not only consists of spherical particles having a high mechanical strength as described above, but also has an easyly controllable Ca P ratio. Therefore, it exhibits an excellent chemical stability and is resistant to organic solvents and strong alkalis, and it is also not liable to be pulverized during service thereof. Thus, the use of the apatite having very high physical and chemical stablities can provide a column having good repeatability of packing and hence good repeatability of chromatographic characteristics such as retention time and retention capacity as well as high durability assuring repeated services thereof. This enables the life span of the apatite column to be prolonged, and, hence, it is very effective in the reduction of the cost concerning the use of the column, thus presenting a great practical significance. Furthermore, adequate choice of the kinds and combination of raw material compounds and solvent, and the conditions of fast thermal decompositon of atomized solution, for example, such conditions that will break the spherical shape of atomized minute droplets heated and solidified in the course of thermal decomposition thereof, enables formation of an apatite consisting of hollow particles each having a weak and hence easily collapsible, spherical husk, or particles formed by collapse thereof. When these particles thus formed are further heat treated in a temperature range of about 1,000 to 1,300 C, a sintered body having the form of rice grain like particles of submicrons in size mutually connected is formed through crystal growth and sintering. This sintered body is either one consisting of particles having a hollow network structure or one consisting of massive particles according to rough classification by preparation conditions. This product of the heat treatment can be easily pulverized to rice grain like particles of submicrons in size by a known method using a turbine mixer, a ball mill, or the like. The apatite powder thus obtained not only has the characteristic feature that it consists of fine particles in the order of submicrons, having a sharp particle size distribution, but also can be easily prepared as an apatite of a stoichiometrical composition having a high stability against heat decomposition during the course of sintering since the control of the Ca P atomic ratio is easy as is apparent from the feature of the process of the present invention. Due to the above mentioned characteristic features, the fine apstite in the order of submicrons obtained by the above mentioned process, is desirable particularly as a raw material powder of bioceramics such as artificial bones and teeth. The following striking effects can be attained by the process of the present invention.

The following Examples will illustrate the present invention in more detail, but should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. A solution of 3.11 g of NH‚ÇÑH‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÇ dissolved in 35 ml of water was admixed with a solution of 14.76 g of Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO dissolved in 50 ml of water, and then further mixed with 100 ml of ethanol by stirring to prepare a raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution and pressurized air were supplied into a two fluid atomization nozzle at rates of 20 ml min and 10 liter min, respectively, and atomized in a flame coming from a gas burner. Fine droplets formed from the raw material solution were instantaneously heated, the solvent evaporated and burned in the flame, thereby leading to thermal decomposition. The powder formed was collected by a cyclone system. The results of X ray diffraction measurement of the formed powder are shown in Fig. 1. As is apparent from Fig. 1, the powder formed by the process of the present invention was a hydroxyapatite whose crystals were well grown. The three main peaks observed consist of a diffraction peak 211 at a diffraction angle 2 œë of 31.7 , a diffraction peak 112 at 2 œë of 32.2 , and a diffraction peak 300 at 2 œë of 32.9 . A solution of 8.59 g of phosphoric acid H‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ content 85.6 dissolved in 20 ml of water was added to a solution of 29.52 g of Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO dissolved in 40 ml of water and admixed with 5 ml of nitric acid, and then further mixed with 120 ml of ethanol by stirring to prepare a raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution was atomized into a flame in the same manner as in Example 1 for thermal decomposition. The powder obtained by this process was found, as a result of X ray diffraction measurement, to be one including a crystalline phase of hydroxyapatite and a small amount of an amorphous phase. A powder as obtained by the process of Example 2 was heated at a rate of 5 C min to 1,300 C, at which it was then heat treated for 1 hour, followed by cooling at a rate of 5 C min. The results of X ray diffraction measurement of the product obtained by the heat treatment showed that the product was a hydroxyapatite whose crystals were better grown than those of the hydroxyapatite obtained in Example 2, and decomposition of which was not recognized even at high temperatures. Thus, it was confirmed that the heat treatment provides a hydroxyapatite having a high thermal stability, the crystals of which are well grown. A solution of 8.63 g of NH‚ÇÑH‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑ dissolved in 20 ml of water and admixed with 5 ml of hydrochloric acid was added to a solution of 18.38 g of CaCl‚ÇÇ 2H‚ÇÇO dissolved in 35 ml of water and admixed with 5 ml of hydrochloric acid, and then further mixed with 120 ml of ethanol by stirring to prepare a raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution was atomized into a flame in the same manner as in Example 1 for thermal decomposition. The results of X ray diffraction measurement of the powder obtained by this process are shown in Fig. 2. As is apparent from Fig. 2, the powder shows a diffraction pattern of chloroapatite. The main peaks observed are a diffraction peak 211 at a diffraction angle 2 œë of 31.4 and superposed diffraction peaks 112 and 300 at a diffraction angle 2 œë of 32.2 . A solution of 4.31 g of NH‚ÇÑH‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑ dissolved in 35 ml of water was admixed with a solution of 14.76 g of Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO dissolved in 50 ml of water and admixed with 5 ml of nitric acid to prepare a raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution was atomized in a reaction tube 30 1,000 mm of an electric furnace, which was preliminarily heated to 1,200 C, from one end of the reaction tube at a rate of 2 ml min. The fine droplets formed from the raw material solution were heated during passage thereof through the reaction tube for thermal decomposition. The product was collected in a container connected to the other end of the reaction tube, while the gas and water vapor formed by the thermal decomposition were aspirated by an aspirator once discharged out of the system. As a result of X ray diffraction measurement of the powder obtained by this process, the conjoint presence of a crystalline phase of hydroxyapatite and an amorphous phase, and a slight amount of calcium carbonate were recognized by the peaks assigned thereto. 3.08 g of phosphorous acid was dissolved in 190 ml of methanol. 6.94 g of CaCl‚ÇÇ was dissolved in the resulting solution to prepare a raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution was atomized into a flame in the same manner as in Example 1 for thermal decomposition. The powder formed was heated in an atmosphere of air at a rate of 5 C min to 1,300 C, at which it was heat treated for 1 hour, followed by cooling at a rate of 5 C min. As a result of detection of chlorine by a silver nitrate solution and X ray diffraction measurement of the powder obtained, it was confirmed that it was an apatite solid solution of hydroxyapatite with chloroapatite. Various calcium phosphorus apatites were obtained in Examples 7 to 17 in which the procedure of Example 1 or 5 was repeated using a raw material and a formulation as listed in Table 1. The heat decomposition temperature, the heat treatment conditions, and the main component are listed for each product in Table 1. 15.58 g of C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP was added to a solution of 36.90 g of Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO dissolved in about 200 ml of ethanol, and the resulting mixture was stirred to effect dissolution thereof. Ethanol was added to the resulting solution to total 250 ml to prepare a homogeneous raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution and pressurized air were supplied into a two fluid atomization nozzle from the liquid supply side and the gas supply side thereof at rates of 10 ml min and 10 liter min, respectively, and atomized in a flame coming from a gas burner. Fine droplets formed from the raw material solution were instantaneously heated, the solvent evaporated and burned in the flame, thereby being thermally decomposed. The temperature during the thermal decompositon reaction was 1,050 to 1,105 C. The powder thus formed was collected by a cyclone system. It was observed to be a fine powder of hollow globules by electron microscopy. Subsequently, the formed powder was found, as a result of X ray diffraction analysis thereof, to be one including a crystalline phase of hydroxyapatite and an amorphous phase, and residual unreacted CaO. A powder as obtained by the process of Example 18 was heated up in an atmosphere of air at a rate of 5 C min to 1,300 C, at which it was heat treated for 1 hour, followed by cooling at a rate of 5 C min. The results of X ray diffraction measurement of the product obtained by the heat treatment are shown in Fig. 3. As is apparent from Fig. 3, the product obtained in this Example was a hydroxyapatite whose crystals hexagonal were well grown, and decomposition of which was not recognized even at high temperatures. 31.16 g of C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP was added to a solution of 45.94 g of CaCl‚ÇÇ 2H‚ÇÇO dissolved in about 200 ml of ethanol, followed by mixing by stirring to effect dissolution thereof. Ethanol was added to the resulting solution to total 250 ml to prepare a homogeneous raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution was atomized and heat decomposed in the same manner as in Example 18. The results of X ray diffraction measurement of the resulting powder are shown in Fig. 4. As is apparent from Fig. 4, it was confirmed that the formed powder included both a crystalline phase of chloroapatite and an amorphous phase. 15.58 g of C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP was added to a solution of 36.90 g of Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO dissolved in about 180 ml of ethanol, followed by mixing by stirring to effect dissolution. Subsequently, an aqueous ammonium bromide solution prepared by dissolving 4.90 g of NH‚ÇÑBr in 25 ml of water was well admixed with the resulting solution, and then additionally admixed with ethanol to total 250 ml to prepare a homogeneous raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution was atomized and thermally decomposed in the same manner as in Example 18. The obtained powder was heat treated in the same manner as in Example 21. As a result of X ray diffraction measurement of the product obtained, the same diffraction pattern of hydroxyapatite hexagonal as in Fig. 3 was obtained, and it included a residual peak of liberated CaO. The product was dissolved in nitric acid, and subjected to detection of bromine with a silver nitrate solution. A silver bromide precipitate was formed so that the presence of bromine was confirmed. Thus, it was understood that the product obtained in this Example was an apatite solid solution of hydroxyapatite with bromoapatite. 15.58 g of C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP was added to a solution of 36.87 g of CaBr‚ÇÇ 2H‚ÇÇO dissolved in about 180 ml of ethanol, followed by mixing by stirring to effect dissolution. Ethanol was added to the resulting solution to total 250 ml to prepare a homogeneous raw material solution. Subsequently, the raw material solution was atomized and thermally decomposed in the same manner as in Example 18. The resulting powder was heat treated in the same manner as in Example 21 b . As a result of X ray diffraction measurement of the product obtained, the same diffraction pattern of hydroxyapatite hexagonal as in Fig. 6 was obtained. The presence of bromine was confirmed with a silver nitrate solution. Thus, it was understood that the above mentioned product was bromoapatite. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO, CaCl‚ÇÇ, CaCl‚ÇÇ 2H‚ÇÇO, CaBr‚ÇÇ 2H‚ÇÇO, NH‚ÇÑCl, CH‚ÇÉO ‚ÇÉP, C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP, CH‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇCHO ‚ÇÉP, CH‚ÇÉ CH‚ÇÇ ‚ÇÉO ‚ÇÉP, C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP, C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÖ ‚ÇÉPO, C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÇPOH, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, H‚ÇÇO, etc. were used as raw materials. Raw material formulations as listed in Table 2 were prepared. They were each subjected to the procedure of atomization and thermal decomposition under the same conditions as in Example 18 except for the conditions as listed in Table 2 to synthesize various calcium phosphorus apatites. A test was conducted in accordance with the following procedures a and b . The effect of addition of aqueous ammonia to a raw material solution could be confirmed by the test. A powder as obtained by the process of Example 36 a was heated up in an atmosphere of air at a rate of 5 C min to 600 C, at which it was then heat treated for 2 hours, followed by cooling at a rate of 5 C min. As a result of X ray diffraction analysis of the product obtained by this heat treatment, only a peak assigned to further grown hydroxyapatite, was recognized crystals of which were further grown. A peak assigned to CaO as scarcely recognized in the powder formed in Example 36 a disappeared and was not recognized at all. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO, CH‚ÇÉO ‚ÇÉP, C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP, CH‚ÇÉ CH‚ÇÇ ‚ÇÉO ‚ÇÉP, C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÇPOH, methanol, ethanol, aqueous ammonia 28 , a 30 aqueous trimethylamine solution, triethylamine, tri n butylamine, etc. were used as components of raw material solutions. Raw material formulations as listed in Table 3 were prepared. They were each subjected to the procedure of atomization and thermal decomposition under the same conditions as in Example 36 except for the conditions as listed in Table 3 to synthesize hydroxyapatites. In every Example, it was confirmed that the hydroxyapatite yield increased as compared with that in the case where neither aqueous ammonia nor amine was added to the raw material solution. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO and H‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ in such amounts as will provide an atomic ratio Ca P of calcium to phosphorus of 1.67 were dissolved in methanol to prepare a solution having a whole solute concentration of 2 mol liter. 25 ml of HNO‚ÇÉ was added to 1 liter of the resulting solution to prepare a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the solution was atomized in a flame coming from a gas burner at a rate of 8 ml min atomizing air pressure 0.7 kg cm¬≤ by using a two fluid atomization nozzle to cause a thermal decomposition reaction. The resulting powder was collected by a cyclone. As a result of X ray diffraction analysis of the powder, it was found to be hydroxyapatite. As a result of scanning electron microscope SEM observation, it was found to be a powder including spherical particles of about 1 to 37 ¬µm. The formed powder was classified by a pneumatic classification machine to extract only regular hydroxyapatite spheres of 5 to 15 ¬µm. The hydroxyapatite particles obtained in the procedure 1 were dispersed in pure water. The resulting dispersion was subjected to a packing pressurization test under pressures varying from 100 to 500 kg cm¬≤ with a stainless high performance liquid chromatography column of 4 mm in inner diameter and 250 mm in length according to the slurry packing method. After the pressurization test, the packed column was dismantled, and the packed hydroxyapatite was observed by a SEM. Deformation and destruction of the particles were not recognized even after application of a pressure as high as 500 kg cm¬≤. The hydroxyapatite particles recovered by dismantling the packed column were subjected again to a packing test according to the same procedure and method as described above. The packing work could be made in the same way as in the first work. The hydroxyapatite particles recovered by dismantling the column were observed by a SEM to find neither deformation nor destruction thereof. The spherical hydroxyapatite particles prepared by the procedure as described in 1 were dispersed in an aqueous NaH‚ÇÇPO‚ÇÑ solution 1 10 M , and packed in a stainless column of 4 mm in inner diameter and 150 mm in length according to the slurry packing method packing pressure 170 kg cm¬≤ . Egg lysozyme was subjected to a measurement with this column by using a sodium phosphate buffer solution having a pH of 6.8 according to the linear gradient method gradient 3.49 10 ¬≤ M ml . When the liquid flow rate was varied from 0.5 to 2.0 ml min 3.13 to 12.5 ml min as converted in a column of 1 cm in inner diameter , the measurement pressure varied from 19 kg cm¬≤ at 0.5 ml min to 81 kg cm¬≤ at 2.0 ml min . Under various conditions, the measurement was conducted stably without any trouble such as blocking. This proves that the packing material according to the present invention is suitable for chromatography at high pressures around 80 kg cm¬≤. This also proves that the packing material according to the present invention allows a low viscosity solution of a protein such as lysozyme to be flowed at a high flow rate of 10 ml min or more as converted in a column of 1 cm in inner diameter, and hence provides a superior characteristic of a column packed therewith to those of conventional columns. The hydroxyapatite particles prepared in Example 47 1 were heat treated in air at 800 C for 2 hours. The analysis of particles obtained showed an increase in the X ray diffraction intensity of hydroxyapatite with growth of crystals and no proof of decomposition of hydroxyapatite. No destruction of the shape of the spherical particles was also recognized in SEM observation. Subsequently, the hydroxyapatite particles thus heat treated were packed in a stainless column of 4 mm in inner diameter and 150 mm in length by the same procedure as in Example 47 3 . Egg lysozyme and cytochrome c were subjected to a measurement with the resulting column at random to carry out a repeated service test of the column for a total of 30 times with egg lysozyme and a total of 20 times with cytochrome c for a grand total of 50 times. Blocking or non blocking of the column and repeatability of the retention time thereof were examined. Every measurement was carried out at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min according to the linear gradient method using a sodium phosphate buffer solution having a pH of 6.8 gradient 3.49 10 ¬≤ M ml . The pressure in the measurement was 20 to 23 kg cm¬≤. No blocking of the column occurred until the last time of the test, and very good chromatograms were obtained. As for the repeatability, a variation of the egg lysozyme retention time in the measurement was examined to find a minimum value of 22.05 minutes and a maximum value of 22.37 minutes throughout the measurement. Although this measurement was not intended to involve such severe test contents as to find the repetition accuracy and repeatability accuracy of the retention time by statistically processing the measured data, the variation was within 2 as is the common yardstick of evaluation of the repeatability as described in manuals or the like concerning liquid chromatography, thus proving that the column used in the measurement had a high repeatability. After the repetition test, the column was dismantled to carry out SEM observation of the spherical particles of hydroxyapatite. No abnormalities such as deformation and destruction of the particles were recognized. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO and H‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ in such amounts as will provide an atomic ratio of calcium to phosphorus of 1.67 were dissolved in 2 methoxyethanol to prepare a solution having a whole solute concentration of 1.0 mol liter. The solution was subjected to fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution in the same manner as in the process of fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution as performed in Example 47 1 to obtain a product which was in the form of a mixture of spherical hydroxyapatite particles of 1 to 6 ¬µm and clumpy hydroxyapatite particles consisting of aggregates of fine crystals. The product was classified hy a pneumatic classification machine to extract only spherical hydroxyapatite particles of 3 to 6 ¬µm. The spherical hydroxyapatite particles thus obtained by classification were packed in a stainless column inner diameter 4 mm, length 100 mm under 400 kg cm¬≤ by the slurry packing method. A test evaluation of them as a packing material was carried out in the same manner as in Example 48. The hydroxyapatite packing material obtained in this Example provided good results of mechanical strength, durability, and repeatability as in Example 48. A solution of 220.25 g of Ca CH‚ÇÉCOO ‚ÇÇ H‚ÇÇO dissolved in 450 ml of 6N HNO‚ÇÉ was mixed with a solution of 85.85 g of H‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ content 85.6 dissolved in 300 ml of methanol to prepare a homogeneous solution. The solution was subjected to fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution in the same manner as in Example 47 1 to obtain spherical hydroxyapatite particles of about 1 to 25 ¬µm. The product was classified by a pneumatic classification machine to extract hydroxyapatite particles of 5 to 15 ¬µm, which were then heat treated at 600 C for 2 hours. Subsequently, column packing and a liquid chromatography evaluation test were effected in the same manner as in Example 49. The hydroxyapatite particles obtained in this Example did not have as regular spherical a shape as the particles obtained in Example 49, and included some distorted or uneven spheres. However, the same results as in Example 49 were obtained for the chromatographic properties. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO and C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÉP in such amounts as will provide an atomic ratio of calcium to phosphorus of 1.67 were dissolved in ethanol to prepare a solution having a whole solute concentration of 1 mol liter. 500 ml of the solution was admixed with 34 ml of aqueous ammonia concentration 28 to prepare a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the solution was subjected to fast thermal decompositon of atomized solution in the same manner as in Example 47 1 to obtain a product consisting of spherical hydroxyapatite particles of about 1 to 8 ¬µm. The product was heat treated at 800 C for 1 hour, and then packed into a stainless column of 4 mm in inner diameter and 50 mm in length under a packing pressure of 500 kg cm¬≤ by the same slurry packing method as in Example 47 3 . Cytochrome c was subjected to measurement with the resulting column and with a sodium phosphate buffer solution having a pH of 6.8 at a liquid flow rate of 0.5 ml min according to the linear gradient method gradient 3.49 10 ¬≤ M ml . The chromatogram in the measurement is shown in Fig. 7. In view of the fact that cytochrome c includes at least two kinds of molecular species, one of which contains an iron atom in an oxidized state, and another one of which contains an iron atom in a reduced state, two mutually clearly separated peaks in Fig. 7 are believed to be assigned to these molecular species the left peak assigned to the oxidezed form of molecules and the right peak assigned to the reduced form of molecules , thus proving that the column in this Example has a high separating capacity. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO and H‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ in such amounts as will provide an atomic ratio of calcium to phosphorus of 1.67 were dissolved in methanol to prepare a solution haiving a whole solute concentration of 0.5 mol liter. The solution was subjected to fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution in the same manner as in Example 47 1 to obtain a product consisting of spherical hydroxyapatite particles of about 1 to 9 ¬µm. The product was heat treated at 600 C for 2 hours, and then packed in a 50 mm column in the same manner as in Example 51. Cytochrme c was subjected to measurement with the resulting column in the same manner as in Example 51. The separating capacity of the column was as high as in Example 51. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO and CH‚ÇÉO ‚ÇÉP in such amounts as will provide an atomic ratio of calcium to phosphorus of 1.67 were dissolved in methanol to prepare a solution having a whole solute concentration of 1 mol liter. 1 liter of the solution was admixed with 68 ml of aqueous ammonia concentration 28 to prepare a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, the solution was subjected to fast thermal decompositon of atomized solution in the same manner as in Example 47 1 to obtain a product consisting of spherical hydroxyapatite particles of about 0.5 to 5 ¬µm. The product was classified by a pneumatic classification machine to remove particles of 1 ¬µm or less. The residual product was then packed in a stainless column of 4 mm in inner diameter and 30 mm in length under a packing pressure of 500 kg cm¬≤ by the same slurry packing method as in Example 47 3 . Lysozyme was subjected to measurement with the resulting column under the same conditions as in Example 51. It was found that the hydroxyapatite packing material obtained in this Example had good chromatographic properties such as mechanical strength and repeatability as in Example 48. A solution having a whole solute concentration of 0.5 mol liter was prepared in substantially the same manner as in Example 53 except that C‚ÇÇH‚ÇÖO ‚ÇÇPOH and ethanol were used as the phosphorus compound and the organic solvent, respectively. The solution was subjected to fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution to obtain a product consisting of spherical hydroxyapatite particles of about 0.5 to 3 ¬µm in size. Classification, packing, and measurement of the product were carried out in the same manner as in Example 53. As a result, good chromatographic properties as in Example 53 were secured. CaBr‚ÇÇ 2H‚ÇÇO and phosphorous acid in such amounts as will provide an atomic ratio of calcium to phosphorus of 1.67 were dissolved in methanol to prepare a solution having a whole solute concentration of 1 mol liter. The solution was then subjected to fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution in the same manner as in Example 47 1 to obtain spheres of about 0.5 to 5 ¬µm in size in the form of an apatite solid solution of bromoapatite with hydroxyapatite. The product was heat treated at 300 C for 1 hour, and then packed in a 50 mm column in the same manner as in Example 51. Cytochrme c was subjected to measurement with the resulting column in the same manner as in Example 51. The obtained chromatogram showed that the separating capacity of the column was as high as in Example 51. Ca NO‚ÇÉ ‚ÇÇ 4H‚ÇÇO and phosphoric acid in such amounts as will provide an atomic ratio Ca P of calcium to phosphorus of 1.67 were dissolved in a solution prepared by adding 40 ml of HNO‚ÇÉ and 150 ml of CH‚ÇÉCOOH to 1 liter of a mixed solvent of methanol and water 6 1 to prepare a solution having a whole solute concentration of 2 mol liter. The raw material solution was subjected to fast thermal decomposition of atomized solution in the same manner as in Example 47 1 . The resulting powder was heat treated in air at 1,000 C for 1 hour. The subsequent SEM observation of the resulting product revealed a sintered body consisting of hollow particles having a spherical hull network structure of 5 to 26 ¬µm as a whole which was formed by network like connection of hydroxyapatite grains of 0.2 to 0.4 ¬µm as well as broken pieces thereof. The powder thus heat treated was then subjected to a pulverization treatment with a miniature test sample mill. It was capable of being pulverized into hydroxyapatite grains of about 0.4 ¬µm.
