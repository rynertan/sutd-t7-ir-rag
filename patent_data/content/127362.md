# Conformable electrodes for proximity coupled electro optic devices.

## Abstract
The electrodes 18 of a proximity coupled, multigate electro optic light valve 12 are formed from 43 or are over coated with 53 a soft, conformable composition which flows in its solid state to conform to the electro optic element 17 of the light valve when the electrodes are pressed thereagainst. For example semiconductor fabrication techniques may be utilized to fabricate a suitably patterned set of electrically independent, elongated electrical conductors 43 on a silicon integrated circuit 41 , and those conductors may, in turn, be overcoated with a high dielectric constant, conformable mat erial 53 , such as indium or aluminum.
