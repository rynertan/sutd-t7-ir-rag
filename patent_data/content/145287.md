# Gauge control system for rod or bar rolling mills.

## Abstract
The dimensions of a product passing through the finishing block of a rod rolling mill are measured. Where the dimensions of the product exiting the last finishing stand are out of tolerance, a calculation is made to determine the extent to which the roll parting of the work rolls of one of the two last finishing stands must be adjusted to bring the product into tolerance. Based on the calculated adjustment, progressively smaller adjustments are made to the roll partings of the work rolls of the upstream finishing stands to distribute the work which must be performed on the product to bring the product into tolerance.
