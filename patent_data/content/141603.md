# Method of forming reinforced thermoplastic composites.

## Abstract
A method of improving the surface finish of a fibre rein forced thermoplastic article in which the fibres are present as superimposed layers of continuous, aligned fibres comprising pressing the layers at a temperature above the softening point of the thermoplastic of the article characterised in that the pressure is transmitted to the superimposed layers through a resilient member and that a metal foil having a thickness of be tween 0.05 and 0.5 mm, preferably between 0.075 and 0.25 mm, is present between the resilient member and the rein forced article to be pressed.
