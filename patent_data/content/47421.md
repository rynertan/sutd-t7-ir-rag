# Improved fault detection in a flame scanner.

## Abstract
A flame scanner has a sensing circuit 10 utilizing a photosensitive device 12 for monitoring and a logic circuit 20 which includes flame detection circuit 22 and a fault detection circuit 24 . A current signal 13 from the photosensitive device 12 is fed to a logarithmic amplifier 14 and converted to a voltage signal 15 . The voltage signal 15 powers an LED 18 with its output 4 impinging on the photosensitive device 12 . The voltage signal 15 is also transmitted to the flame detection cir cuit 22 and the fault detection circuit 24 for simul taneous and independent processing. The flame detection circuit 22 continuously processes the signal to determine if a stable flame is present, while the fault detection circuit 24 continuously monitors the integrity of the photosensi tive device 12 and its associated sensing circuitry.
