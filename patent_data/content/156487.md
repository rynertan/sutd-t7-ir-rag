## Description
AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS FOR RADIO RECEIVERS This invention relates to radio receivers particularly but not exclusively radio pagers and amplifier circu ts for the. Our British Patent 1517121 describes a radio pager for FSK signals and similar to the STC Model 5C pager. This pager is z tone only receiver operating in the VHF high band i38 174 YiHz . It uses a binary digital code format to the POCSAG standard, which provides the receiver with four addresses, each distinguished by a different alert tone pattern. In order to make it possible to produce the complete radio receiver on a single chip, a direct conversion technique is employed in which the radio frequency signal is mixed with a local oscillator on the nominal channel frequency, resulting in a Zero I.F.u. Because the radio signal is frequency modulated there is in fact a beat frequency produced in the mixer, equal to the frequency deviation of the carrier. ConventionalI.F. strips are replaced by audio frequency amplifiers with this technique, and adjacent channel selectivity is provided by low pass filters. To make it possible to recover frequency modulation, the radio frequency signal is fed to two paths with a 90 degree phase difference between them. Each path has its own mixer, fed from the same local oscillator and its own low pass filter and limiting amplifier. The phrase relationship of the two baseband signals will vary according to whether the radio carrier frequency is above or below the local oscillator frequency.The two baseband signals can therefore be combined to recover the modulating signal and this is done in a D type clocked flip flop to the D input of which is applied the output of one of the limiting amplifier stages whilst the output of the other liniting amplifier stage is applied to the clock input of the flip flop. It is an object of the present invention to provide an Improved radio receiver in which the differential amplifier has a high voltage in the differential signal mode gain yet very low common mode gain enabling a stable operating point. According to the present invention nere is provided a signal processing circuit comprising a high i differential amplifier, the amplifier comprising first and second controllable current sources fed with the differential input signal and a controllable differential load circuit, characterised in that the differential current 111 I2 produced is applied across the differential load circuit IL1 IL2 and a feedback elemert , the feedback element comprising transistors T1, T2 sensing the common mode output voltage and means D1 for translating the current so generated into a control voltage Vc to control the differential load circuit IL1 IL2 whereby to provide high voltage gain in the differential signal mode and low common mode cain. In order that the invention can be clearly understood, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawIngs in which Fig. 1 is a block circuit diagram of a radio receiver embodying the invention Fig. 2 shows a theoretical model of 2 high gain amplifier for explaining the present invention Fig. 3 shows a further explanatory rodel Figs. 4 to 9 show various embodiments of the present invention each suitable for use in Fig. 1. Referring to Fig. 1 the input from the aerial A. is fed via an r.f. amplifier not shown to a hybrid transformer H which with associated components not shown provides the two signals in quadrature at the mixers 1 and 2. Mixers 1 and 2 have a local oscillator c providing inputs to derive the baseband signals which are fed to respective bandpass filters 3 and 4. The outputs from the filters 3 and 4 feed the low gain high frequency limiter amplifiers 5 and 6 whose signals are combined in ne D type flip flop 7 and thence fed to the decoder logic circuitry. The low gain high frequency limiter amplifiers 5 and 6 will now be described in detail. The amplifier circuit achieves very high voltage gains in a differential signal mode but has verv low common mode gain, thus maintaining a stable operating point. The common mode operating point is stabilised by the use of a negative feedback control loop. Fig. 2 shows the basic circuit configuration. Controllable current sources I1 and 12 are fed with a differential input signal Vin. As such, they form the canonic differential amplifier configuration. The differential current so produced gmVin where gm is the transconductance of Il and I2 gm1 , is applied across the 1 2 differential load circuit IL1 IL2 and the feedback element ss.By partition the differential output voltage so produced will beEMI3.1 where gOE is the output conductance of the current sources IL1 and IL2 in parallel with the output conductance of the current sources I1 and I2 assuming EMI4.1 a necessary condition for the correct operation of the differential source and gOEL1 gOEL2 so that gOEO gOEI gOEL In practice, voltage gains of over 1000 are easily achieved and because of this the common mode d.c.voltage at the output nodes car. be virtually uncontrollable leading to voltage saturation of one or other of the current sources and thus highly non linear operation. Feedback loop monitors the common mode output voltage and adjusts the currents IL1 and IL2 which are of equal value, so as to maintain the required common mode output voltage, irrespective of I1 and I2, thus maintaining linear operation of the amplifier circuit. Practical realisation In practice, controllable current sources Il I2, 1Ll and 1L2 and the feedback element ss can be realised with bipolar transistors, unipolar transistors, field effect transistors, thermionic valves, etc.Although the following embodiments show bipolar transistors, substitution of the other types of device mentioned above will be tacitly assured. a Gain limitation In practice, the voltage gain is not only limited by the output conductance of the current sources, but also the input conductance of the feedback network and load see Fig. 3 . The gain of this more realistic configuration is thusEMI4.2 Very high voltage gains can still be achieved even with these practical limitations.b sne Feedback Network kr importance aspect of the present invention is the feedback network B. Fig. 4 shows an example realised in bipolar transistors. Transistors T1 and T2 sense the common mode output voltage and generate a current through D1 proportional to this voltage. D1 translates this current into a control voltage to drive the current source loads. Fig. 5 shows the complete realisation. Any desired output common mode voltage can be realised with the inclusion of a voltage source V in the feedback network as shown in Fig. 6. The voltage sourceV can be formed fror forward buried diodes,Zener avalanche diodes, or even resistors, see Fig. 7 . The use of a resistor does not degrade the feedback factor of the feedback element. Greater amplifier linearity can be achieved by linearising the loading effect of the feedback networks input conductance. Figs. 8A and SB show two methods of realising this. Fig. SA shows the addition of two emitter resistors, RE1 and RE2, so as to allow differential output voltage swings of greater than 2Vbe. Fig. 8B shows the use of field effect transistors which inherently have low input conductance variation with applied input voltage. Finally, this circuit can obviously be realised in an inverted version of that already described as shown in Fig. 9. All of the circuits described above are realisable in both discrete and monolithic form. The receiver described in Fig. 1 has various uses, particularly for a radio pager as described, but also e.g. cordless telephones. A decoder circuit is necessary to utilise the data from the receiver circuit. Preferably the amplifier circuits described are combined with the other elements of the radio receiver circuit shown in Fig. 1 and integrated inte a single integrated circuit, except for the discrete corponents such as the hybrid transformer , the crystal for the oscillator f and filter elements for filters 3 and 4 c which are too large to integrate.
