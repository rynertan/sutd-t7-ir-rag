# Process for producing a compacted powder metal part.

## Abstract
A process for producing a powder metal part uses a powder metal composition substantially comprising 1.0 2.5 Ni, 0.3 0.7 Mo, 0.15 0.30 Mn, 0.5 1.5 Cu, 0.3 0.7 C, and 0.5 1.0 zinc stearate, the balance being Fe. This is first compacted. The compacted mass is sintered at a temp erature in the range about 2000 F to 2150 F for a time in the range about 15 to 30 minutes in a furnace having a dew point ranging from about 20 F to 60 F and under an endothermic atmosphere. The part as sintered has good strength and the product has improved machineability.
