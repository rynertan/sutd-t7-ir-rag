# INVERTER FOR USE IN BINARY COUNTER

## Abstract
An inverter for use in a binary counter comprises a flip flop having first and second input output nodes respectively applied with input signals of opposite polarities, a first field effect transistor having a source drain path connected be tween the first input output node and a third node and a gate connected to receive a control clock signal, and a capacitor connected to the third node so as to hold the potential on the first input output node when the first transistor is turned on. Further, there is provided a switch circuit connected be tween a supply voltage and a ground and having a first input connected to the third node, a second input connected to re ceive an inversion input output node. This switch circuit is responsive to the inversion control signal so as to bring its output to a voltage condition opposite to that held in the capacitor.
