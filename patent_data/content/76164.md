# Catalyst component and process for polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
A catalyst for polymerizing ethylene and Î± olefins and process for producing ethylene polymers which comprises homopolymerizing ethylene or copolymerizing ethylene and other olefins in the presence of a catalyst comprising a catalyst component and an organoaluminium compound, said catalyst component being obtained by mechanically copulverizing A a magnesium halide and B magnesium hydrocarbyloxide at a molar ratio of B A 0.5 to 1.5 and subsequently bringing the resulting pulverized product into contact with a tetravalent titanium halide, preferably in the presence of a hydrocarbon and or halogenated hydrocarbon.
