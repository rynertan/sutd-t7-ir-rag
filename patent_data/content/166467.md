# Contactless electric control handle.

## Abstract
A contactless electric control handle having a field coil for forming an electromagnetic field, inductive pick up coils angu larly spaced apart around the axis of the field. The rod of the control handle constitutes the core of the field coil. The field coil and the pick up coils have the shape of annular, concentric conducts, whereas ferrite is applied to the rod in order to employ high frequencies up to 1 MHz.
