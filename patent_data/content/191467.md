# Optical disc apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical disc driving apparatus has a plurality of di vided photoelectric detectors 7a, 7b 7c, 7d , operational amplifiers 12 to 15, 14 , 15 for making sum and difference of the detector outputs, a pickup 1 to 4 having an objective 4 for passing light beam onto the detectors, a feedback servo loop 21, 22, 25, 50 and a sample hold circuit 16, 17 for sampling a mirror portion signal representing the shift of the objective.
