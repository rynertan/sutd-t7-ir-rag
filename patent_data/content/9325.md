## Description
Erythritol Containing Anti Caries Compositions Polyhydric alcohols, or polyols, are valuable aids in formulation a wide variety of food products as described in Handbook of Food Additives, Chapter 11, published by the Chemical Rubber Company, Clevelanc, Ohio.They may be used to impart special effects to the texture or taste of a food product. Since they are generally hygroscopic, they may be used to hold moisture. Many polyhydric alcohols are present in natural foods, either in the free state or chemically combined.Glycerol is by far the most plentiful polyol found in natural foods. However, it is almost exclusively present in chemical combination as fats tri esters of long chain fatty acids in meats and some vegetables. Sorbitol is found uncombined in many fruits such as apples, pears and berries, and also in some other plants. Mannitol occurs at levels as high as 90 in the manna of some types of trees as well as in a variety of vegetables and fruits. Erythritol, mannitol, arabitol and glycerol are known to be produced by the propagation of a variety of yeasts in aqueous nutrient media. Polyhydric alcohols are used in the manufacture of foods, either to promote the retention of the original quality of the food on aging and shipping to the consumer, or to gain a texture or product quality that was not present in the original formula. These qualities are achieved through physical or chemical effects in which the polyols behave as 1. crystallization modifiers 2. hygroscopic agents 3. softening agents 4. sweetness controllers 5. solvent agents 6. viscosity agents 7. rehydration aids 8. dietary agents Sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol and propylene glycol, a synthetic polyhydric alcohol, are presently used as food additives. Propylene glycol must be used with care because of its adverse taste. Erythritol is about 60 as sweet as sucrose at practical use levels and is sweeter than mannitol ana sorbitol which are only 50 as sweet as sucrose under similar conditions. It has an advantage over propylene glycol and glycerol in having a clean and pleasant taste and it is very soluble in water a saturated sctic contains about 38 w w . Unlike other polyols, eryth ritol is not significantly metabolized after oral inges tion in humans, and so is of unique interest as a ncn nutritive sweetening agent.Commercially available erythritol is prepared as a white crystalline product b treating an aqueous alkali carbonate solution of 2 b te 1,4 diol with chlorine and saponifying the resulting chloro hydrin. The natural product can be produced on a commercial scale by propagating specially selected yeast strains in appropriate aqueous nutrient media. It is of special interest to note that erythritol cante produced much more cheaply than certain other polyols such as xylitol. The use of certain polyols to retard the formation of dental caries has been known for some years. For example, Muhlemann, Regolati and Marthaler in theHelv. Odont. Acta., April 1970, p. 48 51, demonstrated that xylitol was more effective than sorbitol in preventing dental caries in rats but that both compounds caused diarrhea and an increased drinking water intake.Nakinen in the J. Dent. Res., V. 51, 1972, p. 403 408 showed that the formation of enzymes responsible for dental caries formation were retarded by xylitol, sorbitol and mannitol. In the Internat. J. Vit. Nutr. Res., 43, 1973, p. 227 232, Grunberg, Beskaid and Brin showed that xylitol is appreciably more effective in reducing the incidence of dental caries than is either mannitol or sorbitol. In a series of papers entitled TurkuSugar Studies , Scheinin, Makinen and Ylitalo, Acta.Odontologica. Scandinavica. V. 22, 1974, p.383 412, thoroughly review the subject of the use of polyols in diet to reduce dental caries in man. They conclude that xylitol shows a dramatic reduction in the incidence of dental caries. There is also a large amount of patent literature involving the use of polyols in food products and health related products. For example, U.S. 3,278,314 describes a sweetened peanut food with long shelf life containing polyhydric alcohols. U.S. 3,352,689 claims a sugarless gum with polyols such as sorbitol and mannitol as the additive which improves taste and texture over comparable sugarless gums. U.S. 3,899,593 claims a xl,litol chewing gum in which at least 50 by weight of the composition is xylitol. U.S. 3,914,434 describes non cariogenic foods and delicacies containing e litol as a sugar substitute.U.S. 3,970,747 describes the use of xylitol as a humectant sweetener, particularly useful in toothpaste.Finally, U.S. 4,000,320 describes chewing gum with improved storage qualities in which xylitol is contained in amounts of less than 50 by weight. The present invention, for the first time, describes the use of erythritol in various compositions to reduce dental caries. A method of inducing cariostasis com prising administering orally to a subject susceptible to dental caries a cariostatic amount of erythritol is claimed. Preferred method of administration is in a form selected from the group consisting of chewing gum, toothpaste, candy, ice cream, carbonated beverage, and mouthwash all members of the group being sugarless, and particularly preferred are sugarless chewing gum and toothpaste. A sugarless cariostatic composition comprising at least 5 erythrito is also claimed. The composition is particularly preferred in the form of a chewing gum or a toothpaste. The novel cariostatic compositions of this invention will comprise at least about 5 erythritol. The compositions may contain considerably more erythritol than this, indeed they may contain as much as 99.98 erythritol. It is well known that sugar containing substances applied to the teeth between meals are more cariogenic than those used with meals. Therefore preferred embodiments of this invention are those which are used between meals such as snack foods, chewing gum and todthpaste. Candies such as fondant, fudge and hard sugarless candies are included. Dietetic ice cream, low calorie carbonated beverages and mouthwash fall within the scope of the contemplated compositions. It will be apparent that in the prevention of dental caries it is desirable to replace sugars such as sucrose and glucose with non cariogenic materials and in the compositions of this invention erythritol is the material of choice. It will further be apparent that the most important sugar to be replaced is that consumed between meals in the form of such materials as snack foods. Erythritol neither promotes the growth of cariogenic bacteria in the mouth nor is it degraded in the mouth by such bacteria into caries causing acids.Thus erythritol may play a more or less passive role by replacing sugar in certain compositions, but it is also proper to speak of it as the active ingredient or active agent in such compositions. There will be further elucidation of these points later in the specification. The best program for preventing caries consists of proper brushing, avoidance of cariogenic foods especially between meals, proper diet and regular dental care. The present invention is intended to be a part of such a dental care program by substituting a non cariogentic stance, erythritol, for cariogenic sugar while maintaining the good taste and esthetic appeal of sweetness in the diet. It will be apparent that the reduction in dental caries achieved will be proportional to the amount of sugar which is replaced in the diet by erythritol and the manner and frequency of erythritol application.Thus, if erythritol containing toothpaste and mouthwash are used exclusively, a significant reduction in caries will be noticed. If, on the other hand, erythritol containing gum and sweetened snack foods such as candies are consumed in addition to the use of erythritol containing toothpaste and mouthwash, a further reduction in the number of caries will be. noted. The susceptibility of humans to caries varies greatly but in general the substitution of as little as 5 grams of erythritol for sugar, especially between meals, will reduce the incidence of caries. A considerable body of experimental work has been done to establish the cariostatic nature of erythritolcontaining compounds and also to compare erythritol to other polyols which are known to prevent caries, such as xylitol, and to known caries producers such as sugars.This study compared cariogenicity of erythritol with some known substances on the basis of several in vitro tests. The information developed by the study is summarized in Table I at the end of this discussion. All compounds used in the test were in 0.78 concentration. The same concentrations were used to determine acid production in a salivary system. Streptococcus mutans strain GS 5, a human cariogenic strain, was used in all cases except the salivary test system in which the endogenous flora was used. Klett tubes containing a tryticase soy yeastcysteine nutrient and fitted with septum caps we flushed with nitrogen gas and preincubated 30 minutes at 370C using standard sterile technicuies, then innoculated with a 2 innoculum of a suspension of S.mutans GS 5 cells in phosphate buffer. These uere then incubated at 370C. Optical density was measured byKlett readings red filter at half hour intervals. Lactic acid production was measured using theSigma Kit for determination of lactic acid. This procedure measures the amount of lactic acid by the following reaction Lactic Acid NAD LDH puvic acic NhDH low A340 high A340NAD is originally present in excess and the increase absorbance of 340 mm due to NADH formation becomes a measure of lactic acid originally present. For the salivary test system, saliva was pooled from volunteers who had fasted three hours and the pH of the pooled saliva was noted. 4.95 ml of pool saliva was aseptically transferred to a series of sterile test tubes. 7 solutions of each compound were prepared and sterilized. 0.05 ml of each was aseptically added to the test tube of saliva to give a final concentration of 0.7 . The test tubes were incubated anaerobically at 370C for four hours. The pH of each was then measured. The first three columns in the table refer to effects of the compounds on the growth characteristics of a cariogenic strain of the bacteria Streptococcus mutans. Reduction of total growth lowered final Klett , reduction of growth rate increase in doubling time and reduction of acid produced increase in inal pH are the effects desired. By these three measures, x 7litol showed the best results, with erythritol closely following. The next six columns refer to certain effects on the metabolism of the bacteria. Columns 4 8 represent measures of the activity of an enzyme or group of enzymes called dextran sucrase DSU which Is one of the principle sources of the cariogeniclty of this organism. DSU converts dietary sugar into polymers which are a major ingredient of cariogenic dental plaque.Such plaque is an accumulation of these polymers, playing an essential role in caries formation and periodontal disease. Therefore, a reduction in plaque formation by means of a reduction in DSU activity is a desired effect. In particular, a reduction in mean specific DSU activity that is, amount of activity per bacterial cell is desired since that would imply a real effect on the organisms metabolism instead of merely a reduction in the number of cells. For these measures, xylitol and erythritol appear superior to the other substances tested. Erythritol, however, is the best in the critical measure DSU mean specific activit column 8 . In column 9, lactic acid production is measured. Lactic acid, produced by cariogenic bacteria in response to ingestion of a meal, can increase acidity enough to dissolve tooth mineral and initiate caries.Therefore, reduction in lactic acid production is desirable. Erythritol was clearly superior in this measure being the only substance which reduced lactic acid relative to the no compound control. Finally, in the last column 10 are measures of the effect on the pH of natural saliva. In this case, the natural mixes population of bacteriais used instead of a pure culture of one strain as in the previous columns, A positive number pH increase, corresponding to reduced acidity is the desired result. Again, erythritol is to best substance in the test by this measure. In summary, erythritol and xylitol were superior to the other test substances in measures of total bac trial growth, growth rate, total acidity, plague producing enzyme activity and lactic acid production for a pure strain of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans, and in salivary pH change fox a naturally occurring mixed bacterial population in human saliva. Although xylitol appeared slightly better than eythritol in in vitro measures of simple bacterial growth, erythritol appeared superior to xylitol in the more critical measures of bacterial production of cariogenic substances ana in mixed bacterial populations in human saliva more closely approximating a real life situ aticn. The examples to follow are merely illustrative and in no way are intended to limit the scope of the appended claims.
