# Angular rate sensor with integrated impulse jet pump assembly.

## Abstract
An angular rate sensor includes a unitary structure impulse pump 70 for providing fluid under pressure, at a constant rate of flow, to a nozzle 28 disposed at one end of a jet chamber 29 to form a constant flow fluid jet, the jet chamber including a pair of temperature sensitive elements 53, 54 disposed at the other end in such a manner as to be differentially cooled by the fluid jet in dependence on the angular rotation of the sensor.
