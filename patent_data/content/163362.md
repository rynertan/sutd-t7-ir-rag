# Displacement measuring apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Displacement measuring apparatus comprises a light source 10 , a lens 12 , an index grating 14 , a reflective scale grating 16 , and three photodetectors 18 at positions corresponding to the zero order and positive and negative first order images of the source 10 . The index grating 14 has a castellated surface profile with a mark space ratio and a castellation height chosen so that the three photodetectors 18 see wavefronts having a phase separation of 120. The electrical signals from the photodetec tors 18 are used to sense the magnitude and direction of movement of a reading head carrying the components 10, 12, 14 and 18 with respect to the scale grating 16 .
