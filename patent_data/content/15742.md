# Wet steam turbine.

## Abstract
A multi stage, wet steam turbine employs steam in its two phase region with vapor and liquid occurring simultane ously for at least part of the cycle, in particular the nozzle ex pansion stages at 32 and 58 . A smaller number of stages than usual is made possible, and the turbine may handle liquid only. Furthermore, simple construction, low fuel consumption and high reliability are achieved. Rotor 24 has rings of vanes 42, 68, 85 and 81 . Vanes 42 and 85 receive liquid, or steam and liquid mixture, and vanes 68 and 81 steam to drive the rotor. Steam exhausting through the vanes 68 enters a recupera tive zone 66 to which feed water droplets are pumped by a Tesla pump 60 from the condenser CC , and the heated wa ter thus formed is scooped up at 70 and returned to the boil er BB . Any steam exiting the zone 66 passes to the nozzles 58 . Rings of water, maintained by the vanes 42 and 85 exit nozzles 47 and 89 to assist in driving the rotor. These rings form further rings 56, 91 of water rotating with a freely rotat able rotor 25 surrounding the turbine rotor. A scoop 57 re moves water from the ring 56 and supplies it to the ring of nozzles 58 . Water from ring 91 is removed to the pump 60 .
