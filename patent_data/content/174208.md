The second member 6 carries a third member 8 which is mounted to rotate about a third axis obliquely inclined to the second axis. First and second mirrors 26,28 are carried by the first member and mounted to rotate with it. The first mirror 26 is situated on the first axis 12 and positioned to reflect a laser beam which is parallel to the first axis on to the second mirror 28 which is on the second axis. Third and fourth mirrors 32,34 are carried by the second member 6 and mounted to rotate with it. Third mirror 32 and fourth mirror 24 are situated accordingly.
