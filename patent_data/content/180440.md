A plate stocker comprises plate inlet 11 and outlet 13 stations for feeding plates, one by one, in a flat state in the horizontal direction toward and from a plate stock section 12 , respectively. The stock section comprises a looped rail 25 1, 25 2 extending between the plate inlet and outlet stations and having upper and lower horizontal rail sections, and a plurality of holders freely movably supported along the looped rail, ca pable of holding plates in an upright state when the holders 14 are supported on the upper rail section of the looped rail. The plates are received, one by one, by turning the plates from the horizontal to the vertical state to transfer them to the holders 14 . The holders are automatically engaged by a belt 26 and move a long the upper rail section toward the outlet station 13 while holding plates and move along the lower rail section backward to the inlet station 11 while not holding plates. Stoppers 46, 47 are arranged on the upper and lower rail sec tions to disengage the holders from the belt.
