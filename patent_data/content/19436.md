# Process for preparation of aromatic tertiary alkyl hydroperoxides and their use in preparing phenols.

## Abstract
Aromatic tertiary hydroperoxides are prepared by the liquid phase oxidation of an aromatic compound having a secondary alkyl group with molecular oxygen in the presence of a basic aqueous solution and a copper compound catalyst. By adding the copper compound catalyst to the oxidation system as an aqueous solution containing A cupric carbonate and B an alkali metal carbonate and or an alkali metal bicarbonate inactivation of the catalyst owing to precipitation is prevented, and hydroperoxides can be obtained at high oxidation rates.
