# Process for the recovering of ethane and heavier hydrocarbon components from methane rich gases.

## Abstract
A process for recovering ethane and heavier hydro carbon components from a methane rich gas which com prises passing said methane rich gas through a series of at least two indirect cooling stages 18, 20, 22 24 and 55, 56 and at least two liquid pressure reduction stages 37, 87 and one turbine expansion stage 64 , resulting in at least three feed streams 82, 96, 100 , which are fed to a demethanizer tower 48 wherein ethane and heavier hydrocarbon components are recovered in high yields from gases high in methane content. Vapors and liquids from the liquid pressure reduction stages are used separately as coolants in indirect heat exchange relation ship with the hydrocarbon feed gas to effect a partial condensation of the feed. Various liquid and vapor streams obtained by the cooling and pressure reduction stages are fed to the demethanizer tower at the appropriate points. The temperatures of these feed streams is in the range of from about 45 to 101 C and the pressure in said demethanizer tower is maintained at a level inter mediate the pressure of the inlet feed and the pressure at the outlet of said expansion stage.
