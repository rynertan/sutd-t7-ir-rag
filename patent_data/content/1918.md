# Underwater lamp and method for its manufacture.

## Abstract
A lamp capable of underwater use comprises a rectangular acrylic body 1 with elongate V shaped recesses 2 in a major surface each receiving an elongate Beta light 5 . An acrylic cover plate 4 is sealed to the major surface and the body 1 is secured to a steel backing plate 12 with a neoprane layer 10 between to help dissipate shock loadings. The sides of the recesses 2 include an angle of 78 to enhance reflection and may be formed by a reflective lining 30 . The Beta lights 5 can be received in the recesses by shock absorbent O rings 96 grouped in pairs with adhesive in between. In a modification a disc shaped Beta light 52 is encapsulated and received in a body 58 formed by pour moulding which is closed by a cap 56 which is ultrasonically welded into place.
