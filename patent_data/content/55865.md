# CATALYST, METHOD OF MAKING AND USE OF SAME FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS

## Abstract
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, a zerovalent chromium compound is introduced onto an activated phosphate containing support and utilized in con junction with an organometal cocatalyst, such as a trialkyl boron. In accordance with another embodiment of this invention, a phosphate containing xerogel is formed by removing water from an aluminum phosphate containing hydrogel by means of azeotropic distillation or washing with a volatile, water miscible organic compound, activated and thereafter zerovalent chromium is incorporated therewith. In other embodiments of this invention, a phosphate containing support is formed by forming aluminum phos phate from an aluminum alkoxide or from a melt, or by phosphating silica or alumina, or by forming an aluminum phosphate silica combination. A support thus formed is activated and a zerovalent chromium compound added. The resulting catalysts are capable of giving high melt index, broad molecular weight distribution polymer, which polymer also exhibits other deviations from typical olefin polymers including lower flexural modulus. The catalyst is ideally suited for forming olefin polymers such as ethylene and ethylene copolymers in a slurry system.
