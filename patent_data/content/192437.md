# Methods and apparatus for binary to decimal interconversion.

## Abstract
A binary code processor for processing binary codes which represent at least first and second types of information in different ranges of value comprises a memory 1 for storing the binary codes, a discriminator 3 for generating an identification code to distinguish the first and second information data from the memory 1 , a subtractor 4 for compressing the range of value of the binary code in accordance with said identification code, a converter 6 for converting the compressed binary code and the identifica tion code to decimal digital codes in accordance with the identification code, and a further memory 7 for storing the decimal binary codes.
