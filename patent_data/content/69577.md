# Process for the production of string like porous material.

## Abstract
A process for producing a tube or rod of a polytetra fluoroethylene is described. The process comprises molding a polytetrafluoroethylene containing a liquid lubricant into a tube or rod by a paste process, removing the liquid lubricant, stretching the tube or rod in the lengthwise direction, and thereafter, by sintering the stretched tube or rod at a temperature of at least 327 C wherein the stretching of the tube or rod is carried out by the use of at least one pair of heating rolls which are each provided with a plurality of grooves. The process provide utilorm stretching making it possible to produce a tube or rod with very small internal diameter.
