# Control system for stopping spindle at predetermined rotational position.

## Abstract
The system has a proximity sensor 10 with a part 10a on spindle 7, and a fixed part 10b including three safurable reac tors SRA₁ to SRA₃ one after another. An output DV₂ derived from SRA₂ is zero when the spindle 7 is in the desired position part 10a confronting SRA₂ , positive when the spindle 7 is slightly to one side of that position and negative when the spin dle 7 is slightly to the other side, and provides a fine position ing signal. The sum ASV of outputs DV₁ and DV₃ derived from SRA₁ and SRA₃ takes values which indicate when the spindle 7 en ters the environs of the desired position. DV₂ and ASV and an actual speed signal AV are fed to a position deviation signal RPD generating circuit 11a. Circuit 11a first delivers a position deviation signal RPD of an initially set voltage ISV corresponding to one spindle revolu tion. When signal ASV indicates the spindle has entered the environs of the desired position, circuit 11a generates a coarse position signal CPD by subtracting the integrated value of AV from ISV, then a bias signal BIS is supplied until ASV indicates the spindle has re entered the environs of the desired position. Then circuit 11a uses DV₂ to bring the spindle to the desired position when DV₂ is zero.
