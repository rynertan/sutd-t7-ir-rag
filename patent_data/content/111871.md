# PROCESS CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A process control system has control stations 3 1, 3 2,..., 3 n for controlling corresponding processes and a first bus 5 connected to the control stations 3 1,3 2,..., 3 n . One of two gathering stations 21 or 41 , as working station, is connected to the first bus 5 , to control the control stations 3 1, 3 2,..., 3 n , exchange process control data therewith, store the process control data and convert the format of the process control data. The process control system also has another gathering station 41 or 21 . The other gathering station 41 or 21 normally receives and stores the process control data. When one gathering station 21 or 41 fails to perform a predetermined operation, the other gathering station 41 or 21 performs the same operation as said working station, in accordance with the process control data stored in the other gathering station 41 or 21 . A second bus 9 is connected to the two gathering stations 21, 41 . A process console 11 monitors processes, to perform central ized process control through the second bus 9 .
