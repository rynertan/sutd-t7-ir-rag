# Process for isolating Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase from aqueous solutions, and enzyme obtained.

## Abstract
Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase SOD is isolated from aqueous solutions containing said enzyme together with accompanying proteins by chromatography of the solution at a pH of 4.7 to 5.5 on a cation exchange resin of the same polarity as SOD in the pH range used. As cation exchange resin may particularly be used carboxymethyl celluloses, cross linked dextrans substituted with carboxymethyl groups or sulfopropyl groups or cross linked agaroses substituted with carboxymethyl groups. The process lends itself to use on an industrial scale and provides a high yield of pure SOD.
