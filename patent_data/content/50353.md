# Abnormal physiological cell detecting device.

## Abstract
This invention discloses an abnormal cell detecting device having at least a pair of electrodes 2a, 2b to be attached to a portion of a body. At least one elec trode 2a of the pair of electrodes 2a, 2b is constituted a by a plurality of independent electrodes cells. One voltage at a frequency is applied between the pair of electrodes 2a, 2b , and another voltage of a different frequency is applied between them. As a result, electro static capacitances corresponding to the two frequencies are measured between the electrodes as voltages by a capacitance measuring unit 3 . The ratio of the voltages is calculated by a division unit 7 , and the resultant ratio is digitally sent out through an A D converter 8 to a memory unit 9 . Digital signals corresponding to a plurality of electrode cells are stored as image data in the memory unit 9 . A dispay unit 10 displays the position and size of abnormal cells, based on the image data of the memory unit 9 .
