# A hydrogenation catalyst composition for the hydrogenation of an oxalate diester, a process for preparing same and the use thereof.

## Abstract
A hydrogenation catalyst composition useful for the hydrogenation of an oxalate diester, said composition being composed of a reduction product of copper containing silica gel formed by contacting an ammine complex of copper with silica gel having an average particle diameter of not more than 200 Âµm a process for producing the aforesaid composi tion and the use of the catalyst composition are disclosed. Using a catalyst composed of the aforesaid composition, ethylene glycol and or a glycolic acid ester can be produced from an oxalate diester efficiently with high conversions and selectivities and without causing pollution attributed to the use of a chromium containing catalyst composition.
