# JOINT RETENTION CLIP FOR RIB LIKE JOINT

## Abstract
A joint retention clip for use in a rib like joint formed by overlapping male and female partial ribs of adjacent panel members in a roof or wall structure. The joint retention clip maintains the partial ribs of the rib like joint in assembled relation in the region between adjacent panel supports. The joint retention clip resides entirely on the protected side of a sealant bead and is thus not subject to corrosion and exhibits improved resistance to applied vertical loads.
