# A semiconductor light emitting device.

## Abstract
In a semiconductor light emitting device, a buried layer 51 of a semiconductor is selectively formed in at least one of a first 2 and a second 4 clad layers in order to determine a light emitting region 31 by the configuration of the buried layer 51 of the semiconductor. The buried layer 51 of the semiconductor has a conductivity type which is opposite to the conductivity type of the surrounding clad layer 4 and an index of refraction which is different from the index of refraction of the surrounding clad layer.
