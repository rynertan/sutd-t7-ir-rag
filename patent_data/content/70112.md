# PROCESS FOR DENITRIFICATION OF TOBACCO

## Abstract
A fed batch fermentation process for reducing nitrate and nitrite content of aqueous tobacco extract is disclosed. Tobacco extract is rapidly and efficiently denitrified in accordance with the process by feeding the extract into a fermentor containing appropriate denitrifying microorgan isms while providing necessary additives and maintaining conditions under which the nitrate and nitrite are reduced via a dissimilatory pathway. The denitrified extract may be applied to tobacco from which soluble solids have been extracted to form reconstituted tobacco for use in smoking products.
