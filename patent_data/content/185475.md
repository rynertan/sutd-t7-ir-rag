# Device for loading a tool with a component.

## Abstract
A fastener installing tool comprises a housing 1 in which a collet 2 which holds a fastener moves back and forth between a forward fastener installing position and a rear loading position. A curved feed tube 6 is pivoted on the housing 1 to swing about its centre of curvature into a fastener delivering position in front of the retracted collet 2 to feed into it a fresh fastener delivered through a hose from a supply. The feed tube 6 swings out of the path of the collet 2 when it next advances. The fastener delivery means is simple, reliable and economic.
