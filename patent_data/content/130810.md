## Description
CONVEYOR SORTING SYSTEM This invention relates to a conveyor sorting system for feeding articles to a main conveyor of the system. Known such systems for use in sorting post parcels have a plurality of discharge positions located along the length of a conveyor at which the parcels carried by the conveyor may be discharged. Each parcel is discharged at a discharge position according tb the destination of the particular parcel and under the control of a controller into which a code indicative of that destination is fed. In one particular form, the conveyor is made up of an effective endless belt of transverse slats with each parcel occupying as many slats as the length of the parcel requires and means are provided at the discharge positions for tilting the slats to discharge the parcels at their intended positions.Code setting means are provided to enable one or more operators at a loading position to feed into the conveyor controller a destination code for each parcel and the control unit is operative to actuate the slat tilting mechanism associated with the required discharge position when the slats occupied by the particular parcel reach the intended destination. In order to make full use of the capacity of the conveyor, the parcels should be fed to the conveyor in a regular continuous manner notwithstanding that there may be more than one loading position connected to the conveyor by a feeding device. Furthenmorej time, speed and space restrictions will normally require that the loading positions be positioned close together. The present invention is concerned with a feeding system which is designed to provide a regular flow of articles to a conveyor and at the sam time to enable a degree of compactness of the feeding system to be achieved According to the present invention, there is provided a conveyor sorting system comprising a a main conveyor b a plurality of feed conveyors, each of which has a loading station at which an article can be loaded on to the feed conveyor for being fed by the latter to the main conveyor c control means for controlling the feed conveyors,for receiving data fed to it relating to articles loaded on to the feed conveyors d respective detecting means at each of the feed conveyors,for detecting articles on the respective feed conveyors and supplying information to the control means in response to such detection, the control means controlling the feed conveyors in response to such information so that articles on the feed conveyors are fed to the main conveyor with a given minimum spacing between successive articles and e further detecting means at the main conveyor, for detecting articles on the main conveyor and supplying information to the control means in response to such detection, the control means checking, in response to such inrormation, whether each article has arrived at the further detecting means at the expected time. The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a system according to an embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is an end view taken on the line A A of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a view on arrow E of Figure 1 Figure 4 shows a detail of Figure 1 to an enlarged scale Figure 5 is a section taken on the line C C of Figure 4 Figure 6 is a section on the line D D of Figure 1 Figure 7 is a flow chart showing the operation of a controller of the system with four input lanes in operation and Figure 8 is a flow chart showing the operation of the controller in a merging area of the system. Referring now to Figure 1, a feeding system for a parcel sorting machine comprises four feed conveyors 1 4 the paths of which merge with that of a main conveyor 5Of the parcel sorting machine.Each feed conveyor incorporates a curved section 6 and a linear section 7 which is upstream of the curved section and on which parcels to be sorted are loaded. In the case of the conveyors 1 and 4, the curved section is followed by a further linear section 8 and finally a substantially triangular section 9. In the case of the conveyors 2 and 3 a substantially triangular section 9 immediately follows the curved section 6. Each of the conveyor sections6 to 8 consists of an endless belt 10 see also Figure 6 passing around end rollers mounted in a housing 11 supported on legs 12 see Figure 3 . Each of these sections is driven, a drive for the section 8 of the conveyor 4 being indicated inFigure 3 at 13.The sections 9 consist of conveyor rollers 14 see also Figures 4 and 5 mounted in a housing 15 which is also supported on legs 12 and each terminates at the downstream end in an apron 16 which overlaps the conveyor 5. The rollers 14 are driven as indicated at 17 in Figure 3. Alterna tively each section 9 may consist of a triangular belt passing around end rollers. In front of each loading section 7 is a chute 18 see also Figure 2 by means of which small items may be separated. Adjacent each section 7 is an operator s seat 19 and a coding device 20 by means of which a code indicative of the destination of each parcel loaded may be registered in a store, using an input device such as a keyboard, forming part of a system for registering the codes of the parcels whilst on the feeding system . Each section 7 is also provided with a light source and photoelectric detector unit 21 which forms in conjunction with the detectors of the other loading sections and a controller controlling the drives of the feed conveyors, a queueing and spacing system as will be described and which initiates entry of the previously stored parcel codes in a transfer memory forming part of the above mentioned registering system.In more detail the detectors 21 of the respective conveyors are each connected to the controller such that a parcel entering the detection zone of a particular detector may only continue past the detector at normal speed if firstly none of the other detectors is detecting the presence of a parcel and secondly the trailing edge of the last parcel to be released has travelled a sufficient distance for the ultimate parcel spacing on the parcel sorting machine to be correct. If these two conditions are not met,then the conveyor section 7 carrying the first mentioned parcel is halted and only re stated when the previously released parcel hAs travelled the sufficient distance mentioned.Furthermore, as each parcel passes past the particular detector 21the controller applies the code registered for that parcel to the aforementioned transfer memory, the signal from the detector being monitored to determine the length of the parcel which is also located in the transfer memory. A minimum spacing between the parcels is achieved by adding to the length code an additional code which represents the gap required between consecutive parcels . This is adjustable. The codes in the transfer memory are advanced in synchronism with the speed of the conveyors 1 4. As will be seen from Figure 1, the beam of each detector 21 is directed across the conveyor path of the particular section 7 at an angle,the purpose of which is to ensure that a parcel leaving the particular detector will reach a zone extending across the main conveyor immediately downstream of the merging area formed by the feed conveyors and the main conveyor and normal to the direction of travel of the main conveyor, in substantially the same time irrespective of the lateral position of the parcel on the feed conveyor. A further light source and photoelectric detector unit 22 is provided on the main conveyor immediately downstream of the merging area to check that each parcel is still on station that is that the position of the code of that parcel in the memory corresponds to the physical position of the parcel on the conveyor as will be described and if correct to apply the code to the controller of the parcel sorting machine. In operation of the feeding system , the conveyor sections 6, 8 and 9 run continuously and at a speed such that the component of the speed of the sections 9 in the travelling direction of the conveyor 5 equals the speed of the conveyor 5. The loading sections 7 normally run at the speed of the sections 6 but are intermittently halted under the control of the detectors 21, as previously mentioned. Parcels are supplied from a source not shown to each operator who takes each parcel, reads the address and enters in the appropriate destination code on his coding device 20 which registers this code in the previously mentioned store. Thereafter, the operator places the parcel on the loading section 7 of his feed conveyor which carries the parcel towards the associated detector 21.After passing past the detectors 21 the parcels proceed along the respective conveyors 1 4 to join the conveyor 5 in sequence and with the correct spacing. On entering the conveyor 5, each parcel travels past the detector 22. This is provided with means enabling the detector in effect to check that the parcels entering the conveyor 5 have not lost or gained station to an extent greater than a prescribed tolerance margin. Firstly, a check is made for approximate coincidence between the presence of the leading edge of a parcelinti deesclcn cm of ie dhrto and the appearance of a destination code at the output of the transfer memory. Secondly1 a check is made between the length of the parcel as measured by the detector 22 and the length of the parcel as indicated by the length code appearing at the output of the transfer memory.Thirdly,a check is made between the spacing code at the output of the memory and the space between the parcel concerned and the next following parcel. Should any of these checks indicate the possibility of a parcel having lost or gained station to an extent greater than the prescribed tolerance margin, then no destination code is applied to the parcel sorting machine controller and the parcel will be conveyed to a miscellaneous parcel discharge position. Otherwise,the destination code together with precise information relating to the position of the parcel and its length is passed to the sorting machine controller in place of the information determined by the detectors 21. It will be seen that the above described feeding system provides a compact and yet reliable system for feeding parcels in a sorting machine, and in particular the disposition of the light sources and photoelectric detector units 21 and the check employed before the parcel codes are assigned to the parcels themselves on the sorting machine serves to reduce the likelihood of mis sorts. Thus, to summarise, the controller could be described as having three main functions, as follows a to stop start the conveyor sections 7 in each feed lane so that parcels are transported on to main conveyor 5 one at a time with a predetermined, fixed clearance between each parcel b to store the address destination code and other data pertaining to each parcel and c to check, after the parcels have merged on to the input of the conveyor 5, that each parcel is positioned such that its code can be reliably identified from those held in the store and that the item is physically sortable. If these conditions are met the data is forwarded to the main conveyor controller. The above mentioned functions will now be described in greater detail with reference to Figures 7 and 8. a. When a parcel is transferred by the operator on to a conveyor section 7, the parcel moves forward until it interrupts the light beam from photo detector 21 across this section . The controller then decides whether the parcel can proceed or whether it has to stop because,if it were released, it would not be sufficiently separated from preceding parcels that may have been injected by other feed conveyor sections.Should a parcel be required to stop, the relevant conveyor section 7 is brought to X controlled halt until such time as the trailing edge of the preceding parcel has passed beyond the photo detector 21 on its own lane by a distance equal to the preset clearance. An allowance is made for the distance by which the held parcel passes the photo detector 21 during deceleration and acceleration.When more than one parcel is required to queue, they are released in the order in which they arrived at the respective photo detector. The controller records distances and parcel lengths by means of pulse generators driven by the conveyor sections 7. b. When an operator registers a code on the keyboardlthe information is held, within the controller, in a keyboard buffer store. When the leading edge of a parcel interrupts the light beam 21 of the relevant conveyor section 7, this information is transferred to a main code store. Prior to this transfer occurring the operator may cancel and reenter the code. The controller also records the length of each parcel as it passes through the light beam of the relevant conveyor section 7 and the position of the parcel leading edge, which is advanced as the parcel proceeds through the conveyor. c. The time when each parcel should reach the detector 22 can be predicted from the leading edge information. To ensure that the correct code is associated with each parcel, codes are only forwarded, from the controller to the main conveyor controller, when the parcel interrupts the light beam across the main conveyor within a small, preset table distance of its theoretical position. This margin allows for the variations of parcel position that occur as the item is transported through the conveyor system. Should an item be removed, or significantly delayed or advanced or be present when it should not be, a reject code is applied to the item. The photo detector 22 enables a second check to be made to ensure destination codes are not applied to the wrong parcel.The parcel length, measured initially on the relevant conveyor section 7, can be compared with that measured by the photo detector 22, agreement to within a preset margin being necessary before the code data is forwarded to the main conveyor controller. The photo detector 22 is then used to check that the clearance between parcels has not been reduced sufficiently to prevent subsequent sorting. Should it have been so reduced, a reject code is again applied to the offending parcel s . Finally, because the position and orientation of most parcels will have altered slightly during transportation through the conveyor system, the positional and length data obtained from the photodetectors 22 is used for the subsequent sorting process, replacing the data obtained from the photo detectors 21. Although this embodiment of the invention has been described with reference to a system wherein a plurality of conveyors feed a main conveyor as described above, it will be appreciated that the controller also be used when a plurality of conveyors feed a single parcel sorting machine, which would then act as the main conveyor of the system.
