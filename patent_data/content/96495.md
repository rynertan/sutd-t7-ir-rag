# Cardiac flow measurement system and method.

## Abstract
The volume of blood pumped by an artificial ventricle 10 or ventricular assist device is extracorporeally moni tored as a function of the volume of fluid used to drive the ventricle. The ventricle 10 is divided into two chambers 11,13 by a flexible diaphragm 15 . Fluid is alternately supplied to one chamber 11 during systole and then removed from that chamber 11 during diastole. In the preferred embodiment, during systole the rate of fluid flow is sensed by establishing a differential pressure between two points in the fluid s flow path 17 . The differential pressure is converted to a proportional voltage which may be integrated to provide the desired volume over a given time interval, which corresponds to the cardiac output within 5 10 .
