# TWO WIRE BIDIRECTIONAL DIGITAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A two wire bidirectional transmission system for trans mitting electrical signals simultaneously in opposite direc tions between terminals over a pair of wires wherein the transmitter at one terminal transmits a voltage signal over one of said wires while the transmitter at the second terminal generates a voltage signal over the same wire, the second wire being grounded at each end. Impedance matching resistors, that is resistors matched to the impedance of the two wires, are coupled between each of the transmitters and the wire upon which the voltage signal is generated. A subtractor circuit is provided at each of the terminals for linearly subtracting a signal proportional to one half of the voltage transmitted and thereby receiving at each terminal a voltage signal equal to one half of the voltage transmitted by the opposite terminal.
