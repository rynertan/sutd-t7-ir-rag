# Fire retardant acrylic fibers.

## Abstract
Acrylic fibers having high fire retardancy, glossiness and transparency comprise a copolymer containing 30 to 70 by weight of acrylonitrile and 30 to 70 by weight of at least one halogen containing monomer, and further contain 0.2 to 3.0 by weight of at least one organic tin compound which is soluble in a solvent which can dissolve the copolymer, and 0.2 to 20 by weight of a glycidyl methacrylate polymer, based on the weight of the copolymer.
