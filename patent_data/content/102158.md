# Method of producing fibre reinforced composition.

## Abstract
A process of producing a fibre reinforced composition comprising drawing a plurality of continuous filaments through a melt comprising a mixture of a thermoplastic polymer and a plasticiser for the polymer in the weight ratio between 1 4 and 99 1 of polymer to plasticiser, preferably in the weight ratio 1 1 to 19 1, the plasticiser being thermally stable at least up to the temperature of the melt and having volatility characteristics such that the plasticiser is not substantially volatilised from the composition below the melt temperature of the thermoplastic polymer but has a sufficiently low volatility at the temperature of the melt to plasticise the polymer in the melt and give a melt of reduced viscosity compared with the melt viscosity of the polymer alone. The process enables improved fibre wetting and or easier processing to be achieved in comparison with a process in which no plasticiser is used. Higher molecular weight polymer may also be used than when plasticiser is absent.

## Description
METHOD OF PRODUCING FIBRE REINFORCED COMPOSITION This invention relates to a method of producing fibre reinforced compositions in which long fibres are contained in a thermoplastic polymer matrix. Processes are known in which a fibre reinforced composition is produced in a continuous manner by pulling a continuous tow or roving of fibres through a bath of low viscosity thermosettable resin to impregnate the fibres.The impregnated composition is subsequently cured by heating. Although the products produced have found great utility as constructional materials they lack the versatility of products impregnated with thermoplastic polymers in that once the product has been cured it is extremely difficult to form an article of a different shape from the cured product. There has been no significant development of a comparable continuous process using a thermoplastic polymer. The use of melts of thermoplastic polymers does not give a satisfactory product because the viscosity of the melt of a polymer of normal molecular weight is too high to allow rapid impregnation of a fibre tow or roving. Limited use has been made of solutions of thermoplastics, particularly in non continuous processes where a fibre mat is impregnated with a solution and subsequently compression moulded.There are severe restraints on the use of a solution process in a continuous process because of the difficulties in preparing a solution containing more than about 20 of polymer and the subsequent difficulty in removing and recovering the large quantities of. solvent involved with such dilute solutions. A method has been proposed of using low molecular weight thermoplastic polymers which inherently are of low viscosity preferably below 30 Ns m2 . Such polymers give rise to good fibre wetting and compositions of surprisingly high mechanical properties.However, such polymers generally have to be made as speciality polymers because the commercially available grades are of such a high molecular weight that their melt viscosities at any temperature below their decomposition temperature is too high for adequate fibre impregnation particularly where high loading of fibre, for example at least 50 by volume of fibre is required.Typically, commercially available thermoplastic polymers have a melt viscosity of at least 100 Ns m2. It is increasingly difficult to achieve adequate fibre wetting at high fibre concentrations particularly in a continuous process as the melt viscosity increases above 100 Ns m2. A continuous process has now been devised for producing fibre reinforced products in which it is possible to get an excellent level of fibre wetting by the polymer melt even though a high molecular weight product is used and in which high fibre loadings are achieved. Accordingly there is provided a process of producing a fibre reinforced composition comprising drawing a plurality of continuous filaments through a melt comprising a mixture of a thermoplastic polymer and a plasticiser for the polymer in the weight ratio between 1 4 and 99 1 of polymer to plasticiser, preferably in the weight ratio 1 1 to 19 1, the plasticiser being thermally stable at least up to the temperature of the melt and having volatility characteristics such that the plasticiser is not substantially volatilised from the composition below the melt temperature of the composition. Surprisingly, fibre reinforced compositions can be produced in which the presence of substantial amounts of residual plasticiser do not detract from the strength properties achievable in the absence of the plasticiser. By a wplasticiser in the context of this invention is meant a material which will enable a melt to be obtained from a polymer having a lower melt viscosity than that of the polymer alone measured under the same conditions. Although the combination of polymer and plasticiser will normally exist as one phase this is not essential and more than one phase may exist. It is an essential feature of the invention that the polymer in the mixture is present in melt form. The temperature of the melt must be above the glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer component. In the case of a crystalline polymer its melting point may be well above its Tg so that the temperature of the melt must be well above the Tg of the polymer employed. It is not necessary in every case that the temperature of the melt is above the melting temperature of the polymer itself because in some cases the plasticiser will lower the melting point of the polymer. By the term continuous fibres or plurality of continuous filaments is meant any fibrous product in which the fibres are sufficiently long to give a roving or tow of sufficient strength, under the processing conditions used, to be hauled through the molten polymer without the frequency of breakage which would render the process unworkable. Suitable materials are glass fibre, carbon fibre, jute and high modulus synthetic polymer fibres. In the latter case it is important that the polymer fibres conform to the proviso of having sufficient strength to be capable of being hauled through the polymer melt without breakage disrupting the process.In order to have sufficient strength to be hauled through the impregnation system without breakage the majority of the continuous fibres of the fibrous product should lie in one direction so that the fibrous product can be drawn through molten polymer with the majority of the continuous fibres aligned. Fibrous products such as mats made up of randomly disposed continuous fibrous are not suitable for use in the invention unless they form part of fibre structure in which at least 50 by volume of the fibres are aligned in the direction of draw. The continuous fibres may be in any form having sufficient integrity to be pulled through the molten polymer but conveniently consist of bundles of individual fibres or filaments, hereinafter termed rovings in which substantially all the fibres are aligned along the length of the bundles. Any number of such rovings may be employed. In the case of commercially available glass rovings each roving may consist of up to 8000 or more continuous glass filaments. Carbon fibre tapes containing up to 6000 or more carbon fibres may be used. Cloths woven from rovings may also be suitable for use in the present invention. The continuous fibres may be provided with any of the conventional surface sizes, particularly those designed to maximise bonding between the fibre and the matrix polymer. Compositions made according to the process of the invention contain at least 30 by volume, preferably at least 40 by volume and desirably at least 50 by volume of reinforcing fibres. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the use of high molecular weight polymers, that is those having a melt viscosity of more than 100 Ns m2 measured below the decomposition temperature of the polymer and at zero shear rate. The invention is also very useful when applied to low viscosity polymers because of the improvements that can be obtained in respect of ease of running stability of the continuous process and the higher fibre contents achievable. Although the process can be applied by using a melt bath of the polymer plasticiser mixture, through which the continuous tow or roving is pulled over at least one spreader surface, such a melt bath presents a disadvantage in respect of the containment of vaporised plasticiser.European Patent Publication No. 56703 describes an impregnation process in which the amount of molten polymer present at a given time is minimised. By adapting this process the amount of mixture present as a melt at any given time is minimised by using a process in which the continuous roving or tow is formed into a band comprising substantially contiguous filaments which are pulled over a spreader surface, preferably a heated spreader surface, to form a nip between the band and the spreader surface and a molten mixture of polymer and plasticiser is provided at the nip. In an alternative process at least part of the heat required to provide a molten mixture is provided by heating the fibre directly.Impregnation of the band formed by the contiguous filaments is effected by tensioning the continuous band so that positive pressure is applied on the polymer melt by the band as it is pulled over the spreader surface . The mixture of polymer and plasticiser supplied to the nip may take a variety of forms. It may, for example, comprise a dry blend of polymer powder and plasticiser or a melt of the mixture prepared externally, for example in a screw extruder and metered as a melt to the nip. Yet again, the band of contiguous filaments may have been provided on one or both sides with a coating of the polymer plasticiser mixture which is caused to impregnate the band and wet the filaments after the polymer has been melted and the coated band is biassed against at least one spreader surface, which is preferably a heated spreader surface.The coating may be in the form of a preformed film or tape of the polymer containing plasticiser or may be separate films of polymer and plasticiser which are fed in loose contact with the contiguous band of filaments and are impregnated into the band by biassing against a spreader surface, sufficient heat being supplied to melt the preformed films. In one embodiment of the process of using a band of contiguous filament the continuous filaments are most suitably tensioned and aligned by pulling them from rolls or reels over a series of spreader surfaces, such as the surfaces of rods. This enables bundles of filaments to be spread out as far as possible into individual filaments which are under considerable tension. These filaments are guided to provide a band of contiguous filaments as they pass over a spreader surface. The shape of the spreader surface and the angle of contact of the filament band with the surface should be such as to provide a nip between the band and the heated spreader surface. The mixture of thermoplastics polymer and plasticiser is fed to the nip and sufficient heat is supplied to the system to provide a melt of the mixture at the nip.The melt impregnates and wets the fibres of the band as the band passes over the spreader surface by virtue of positive pressure between the band and the spreader surface. This process may be further modified by providing at least one further spreader surface with which the at least partially melt impregnated fibre band forms a second nip by means of which a further supply of melt may be impregnated into the fibre band. Either surface of the partially impregnated band can be used to form the working surface of the nip. The amount of polymer in the reinforced structure is controlled to a large extent by the tension in the band and the length of path over which the band contacts the spreader surface. Thus where the band is under high tension and contacts the spreader surface over a substantial area, so that the band is strongly urged against the spreader surface, the polymer content of the reinforced structure will be lower than under low tension short contact path conditions. The spreader surfaces and any subsequent surfaces used to improve impregnation or to improve surface finish are preferably in the form of cylindrical bars or rollers.These may be stationary or capable of either free or driven rotation. For example, the first impregnation surface may be a freely rotating roller which will be caused to rotate by the band at the speed of the band so that attrition of the fibre prior to impregnation or sizing by the melt is reduced to a minimum. It has been observed that if the first roll is rotated either freely or driven in the direction of the movement of the fibre at up to the speed of the fibre any accumulation of loose fibre on the band is carried through the system. This self cleaning action is particularly useful in preventing an accumulation of fibre at the first roll which could cause splitting of the band.After the band has been impregnated with some of the melt mixture, preferably after being provided with further molten mixture on the other side of the band by means of a second freely rotatable heated surface, the fibre is much less susceptible to attrition and may be subjected to treatments to improve wetting of the fibres. Thus the polymer containing band may be passed over at least one roller driven in a direction opposite to that of the travel of the band to increase the local work input on the band and maximise wetting.In general, the degree of wetting and the speed of the process may be increased by increasing the number of surfaces at which there is a work input A further advantage of the process employing a band of fibre to form a nip, over the process which requires the use of a bath of the molten mixture, is that of reducing the risk of degradation. Thus the relatively small amount of melt mixture present in the nip between the fibre band and the spreader surface ensures that large quantities of polymer are not held at an elevated temperature for prolonged periods. Provision can also be made to include a scraper blade at positions at which the melt mixture is fed to the nip to remove any excess polymer which might accumulate during processing and which might be subject to thermal degradation. The impregnated band produced by the process of the invention may be subjected to further treatments depending on the intended shape and purpose of the end product. The separated filaments in the impregnated band may, for example, be drawn together through a die to provide a profile of considerably greater thickness than the impregnated band. A limited amount of shaping may be effected in such a die to provide a shaped profile. The impregnated products of the processes hereinbefore described may be wound on rolls for subsequent use in fabrication processes requiring a continuous product or may be chopped into lengths for subsequent fabrication. The continuous lengths may be used to fabricate articles, for example, by winding the heat softened product around a former, or, for example, by weaving a mat from tapes or strips of the product. The impregnated product may be chopped into pellets or granules in which the aligned fibres have lengths from 3 mm up to 100 mm. These may be used in conventional moulding or extrusion processes. When glass fibre is used the fibre content of the product of the invention should be at least 50 by weight of the product to maximise the physical properties of the product. The upper limit of fibre content is determined by the amount of polymer required to wet out the individual fibres of the roving. In general it is difficult to achieve good wetting with less than 20 by weight of polymer although excellent results are obtainable using the process of the invention to incorporate 30 by weight of polymer in the fibrereinforced composition. The thermoplastic polymers used in the invention are preferably aromatic thermoplastic polymers containing aromatic repeat units in the chain, such as polysulphones, polyethersulphones, polyetherketones, polyetheretherketones, polyarylene oxides, polyarylene sulphides, aromatic polyamides, aromatic polyesters, aromatic polycarbonates and polyetherimides. In general, the thermoplastic aromatic polymers used in the compositions of this invention comprise repeat units of the general formula Ar Xwhere Ar is selected from mono or polycyclic aromatic radicals and X is selected from at least one of O, S,SO2, O.CO, O.CO.O, CO, NHCO andEMI9.1 Ar and or X may vary from unit to unit in the polymer chain. Particularly useful are the class of polyetherketones which contain the recurring unit I EMI9.2 Such polymers are disclosed, inter alia, in British patent specification 1 414 421 which describes such polymers containing the unit I as the sole repeating unit or in conjunction with the repeating unit II EMI9.3 A preferred polyetheretherketone having the repeating unit III EMI10.1 either alone or in conjunction with other repeating units is disclosed in European patent publication No. 1879. The other repeating units present in the polymers described in the European application may be of the repeating unitEMI10.2 where A is a direct link, oxygen, sulphur, SO2 , COor a divalent hydrocarbon radical.The repeat units may also be of formula V EMI10.3 where the oxygen atom in the sub units EMI10.4 are ortho or para to the groups Q and Q , Q and Q which may be the same or different are CO or SO2, Ar is a divalent aromatic radical, and n is 0, 1, 2 or 3. The polymer of repeat unit III is hereinafter termed PEEK. Another particularly useful class of compounds are the aromatic polysulphones. Thermoplastic aromatic polysulphones generally have at least some units of the structureEMI10.5 where Y is 0 or S or the residue of an aromatic diol such as a 4,4 bisphenol. Those polysulphones containing ether linkages between some of the aromatic rings are known as aromatic polyethersulphones and may be more generally defined as polymeric material containing repeat units of the general formula E O E O in which E is the residuum obtained by removal of the halogen atoms of a dihalobenzenoid compound in which each halogen atom is activated by an 502 group ortho or para thereto, and E is the residuum obtained by removal of the hydroxyl groups from a bisphenol.E and E may be the same or different and indeed E and or E may vary from unit to unit in the polymer chain. Where E is the same as E it may be considered to be the residuum resulting from the removal of the halogen atom and the hydroxyl group from a halophenol in which the halogen atom is activated by an S02 group ortho or para thereto. Up to 50 of the 502 groups in the halophenol, dihalobenzenoid compound or bisphenol may be replaced by CO groups. The residue E preferably has the structureEMI11.1 where Z is a direct link or Ar SO2 where Ar is a divalent aromatic radical such as biphenylyleneEMI11.2 Examples of such polyethersulphones have the repeating unitsEMI12.1 Other polymers incorporateEMI12.2 units in the polymer chain, e.g. to give the repeat unitsEMI12.3 which may be present by themselves or in conjunction with repeat units such asEMI12.4 Examples of polyethersulphones and processes for their production are described in British patent specifications 1 016 245, 1 060 546, 1 078 234, 1 109 842, 1 122 192, 1133 561, 1153 035, 1153 528, 1 163 332, 1 177 183, 1 234 301, 1 264 900, 1 265 144, 1 296 383, 1 298 821 and 1 303 252, Canadian patent specification 847 963, German OLS specification 1 938 806 and 2 433 400 and Swiss patent specification 491 981. The plasticisers which are suitable for use in the invention are materials which are thermally stable at the elevated temperatures which are characteristic of the melting points of the aromatic polymers used in the invention, and which are substantially involatile at the temperatures required to form a melt of the polymer and plasticiser. Suitable plasticisers having these characteristics are found in the classes aromatic ketones, aromatic sulphones and aromatic esters. Typical high boiling materials which are suitable for use with high melting polymers, such as polyetherketones, are diphenoxy benzophenone and diphenoxydiphenyl sulphone. The mixture of plasticiser and polymer may be provided by any conventional technique for providing mixture. For example, mixture may be a dry blend of polymer and plasticiser, a mixture which has been intimately mixed by compounding in a screw extruder, a mixture prepared by coating granules of the polymer with a solution of a plasticiser and volatilising the solvent from the coated granules or in some cases a suitable plasticiser may be used in the course of producing the aromatic polymer. Whereas in the normal course of isolating such polymer the plasticiser would need to be removed the plasticised product constitutes an ideal and cheaper raw material for the present invention than the isolated polymer. Although the major use of the impregnated products obtained from the processes hereinbefore described is in applications requiring the use of long lengths of the products, that is greater than 100 mm long, the products find particular utility when chopped into pellets or granules in which the reinforcing fibres have a length of at least 3 mm and preferably at least 10 mm. These products may be used in the conventional fabrication process such as injection moulding and show advantages over prior art products in pellet form because the fibre length in the pellet is retained to a much greater extent in articles fabricated from the pellets of the invention than when using the prior art products.This greater retention of fibre length is believed to be a result of the greater protection afforded to the individual reinforcing filaments in the product of the invention by virtue of the good wetting by polymer which arises from use of the processes hereinbefore described This aspect of the invention is particularly important because it enables reinforced articles to be formed in versatile operations, such as injection moulding, which employ screw extrusion processes to melt and homogenize the feed material, with a surprisingly high retention of fibre length and consequent enhancement of physical properties. Thus the product of the invention enables moulded articles to be obtained from fabrication processes which employ screw extrusion which articles contain at least 50 and preferably at least 70t by weight of the fibres in the article of a length at least 3 mm long. This is considerably longer than currently obtainable from the commercially available reinforced products. The products suitable for injection moulding may be used directly or may be blended with pellets of other thermoplastics products. These other products may be of the same polymer but having different molecular weight or may be of a different polymer providing that the presence of the different polymer does not adversely affect the overall balance of properties of the composition. The other products may be an unfilled polymer or may contain a particulate or fibrous filler.Blends with materials containing the conventionally produced reinforced moulding powders, that is moulding powders with reinforcing fibres up to about 0.25 mm long are particularly suitable because the overall reinforcing fibre content of the blend can be kept high to produce maximum strength even though the shorter reinforcing fibres do not contribute so effectively as the long fibres present from the product of the present invention. The invention is further illustrated by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 In this example two high boiling point additives were assessed to determine their suitability as plasticisers for a high molecular weight sample of poly etheretherketone , and their volatility with respect to the processing temperature range of the polymer. The plasticising characteristics were assessed by differential scanning calorimetry techniques to measure the glass transition temperature Tg of polymer compositions ccntaining the potential plasiticisers in comparison with the polymer itself. Values were also obtained for the melting point of the compositions Tp , the temperature Tn at which crystals start to form from the glassy state as the temperature is raised above theTg, the temperature Ts at which crystal growth starts on cooling, and Tp, the temperature at which the crystallisation rate is at its maximum. A sample of polyetheretherketone powder PEEK having a high molecular weight a melt viscosity of 200 Ns m2 at 3700C at zero shear rate was dry blended with diphenoxybenzophenone powder to give a composition containing 5 by weight of the additive. A 10 mg sample of the composition was dried overnight at 800C under vacuum. The dried sample was heated to 4000C for 2 minutes and then quenched in liquid nitrogen to remove any residual crystallinity. The sample was placed in a PerkinElmer DSC 2 machine and heated at 200C minute to a temperature of 4000 C, held at this temperature for 2 minutes and then cooled at 200C minute. The table below records the values obtained for the polymer alone, and compositions containing 5 by weight of diphenoxybenzophenone DPBP and diphenoxy diphenylsulphone DPDPS respectively.

The thermal stability and volatility of the additives was assessed in the presence of the polymer using a thermogravimetric balance supplied by Stanton Redcroft at a heating rate of 50 minute in air. The analysis of samples of the dry blends of PEEK and the stabilisers compared with the PEEK alone showed that the additives were substantially involatile in the presence of the PEEK up to the decomposition temperature of the PEEK. A dry blend of the PEEK used above and diphenoxybenzophenone containing 5 by weight of the additive was used as a feedstock to impregnate carbon fibre tow obtained from Courtaulds PLC as XAS unsized in the process described in Example 32 of European Patent Publication No. 56703. As a control run the PEEK, containing no additive, was run through the same process.A further run was performed using a dry. blend of the samePEEK together with 5 by weight of diphenoxydiphenylsulphone. The products were obtained as a continuous pultruded strip about 50 mm wide. Test pieces were formed from this strip by stacking 20 plies 150 mm in length in a matched die compression moulding tool. This tool was heated to 3800C, in a conventional laboratory press. The moulding was held at light pressure for 5 minutes to enable the sample to reach equilibrium temperature. The pressure was then held at 5 x 106 N m2 for 5 minutes before being cooled under pressure to 1500C before removal from the press. The cooling stage too approximately 12 minutes. The mould was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and the moulding was then extracted. Mouldings of thickness between 2 and 3 mm were formed in this way. The results obtained are given in Table 2.

EXAMPLE 2 The general procedure of Example 1 was used to impregnate continuous carbon fibre roving AS4 supplied byHercules Corp using a polymer of methyl methacrylate Diakon MG obtainable from Imperial Chemical IndustriesPLC having a melt viscosity of 1200 Ns mz at 250 C and zero shear rate and dibutyl phthalate as the melt plasticiser. The procedure was carried out using a weight ratio of polymer to plasticiser of 80 20 at a melt temperature of 2500C and a pull through of 30 cm minute. A product containing 47 by weight of fibre was produced with fair impregnation. The procedure was repeated using a polymer plasticiser ratio of 1 1. A well impregnated product having a fibre content of 59 was produced. In a control run without plasticiser an attempt was made to impregnate using the acrylic polymer at atemperature of 2500C. Great difficulty in running was experienced, with frequent breaks in the carbon fibre tow because of the high melt viscosity. The product obtained 34 by weight carbon fibre exhibited very poor wetting of the fibre by the polymer, These prepregs were made up into sheet stock 5 layer woven 0.90 45 0.90 45 0.90 and moulded at 2100C.The samples were studied in the instrumented fall weight impact test all results normalised to 2.5 mm thick .

EXAMPLE 2 The general procedure of Example 1 was used to produce glass reinforced nylon 6 prepreg Akulon M921D nylon 6 containing 10 caprolactam was used to impregnate a continuous glass roving Vetrotex R099, 12 ends each 2400 tex at a temperature of 2650C. The glass roving was pulled off at a rate of 45 cm minute. Although some of the caprolactam volatilised during the impregnation procedure the majority remained in the sample. The pultrusion contained about 74 glass fibre. In a control run Akulon K222D nylon 6 was used without plasticiser. The glass fibre content was approximately 74 . The flexural modulus of the product containing plasticiser was 55 GN m2 compared with a value of 51 GN m2 for the unpiasticised product. The greater stiffness of the plasticised product was attributed to better wetting of the glass fibres.
