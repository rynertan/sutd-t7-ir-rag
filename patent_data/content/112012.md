## Description
GENOMIC BOVINE GROWTH HORMONE, ITS PREPA.RATION, AND HOSTS CONTAINING IT This invention relates to genomic bovine growth hormone, its preparation, and hosts containing it. Bovine growth hormone BGH is a 191 amino acid poly peptide, synthesised initially as a pregrowth hormone containing a signal peptide of 26 amino acids seeHunt et al, Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure , ed.M.O. Dayhoff National Biomedical Research Foundation,Washington, D.C. Vol. 5, Suppi. 2, pp. 113 139, andLingappa et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 74 1977 2432 2436. The 3 untranslated region of BGH has been shown to be 104 nucleotides in length see Sadavage et al, Biochemistry 19 1980 1737 1743. It has been shown that the RNA of bovine proclactin PRL and BGH comprise most of the mRNA population of the bovine anterior pituitary see Nelson et al, J. Biol. Chem. 254 1979 1516 1520. Miller et al, J. Biol. Chem. 255 1980 7521 7524, and Xeshet et al, Nucleic Acids Res. 9 1981 , have reported the cloning of BGH cDNA. EP A 0067026 discloses the cloning of bovine pituitary growth hormone cDNA into the Pst 1 site of plasmid pBR322 by the oligo dG oligo dC tailing technique. A BGH genomic clone according to the invention, designated pXGH2R2, was deposited in the permanent collection of the Northern Regional Research Laboratory NRRL ,U.S. Department of Agriculture, Peoria, Illinois, U.S.A.It was deposited on 21st November 1982 in E. coli HB101 as host, and its accession number in this repository isNRRL 3 15154. On 22nd November 1982, in the same host, the genomic clone p GH2R3 was deposited its accession number is NRRL B 15155. The nucleotide sequence of genomic BGH of the present invention is as follows.

The subject invention includes the above nucleotide sequence and functional equivalents of the nucleotide sequence. By functional equivalents is meant nucleotide sequences which can be used in sub stantially the same way to get substantially the same results in the preparation of bovine growth hormone by a suitable host. In the accompanying drawings, Figure 1 shows the structure of the bovine growth hormone genomic and cDNA clones. Part a shows the structure of the genomic AGh2. The hatched box represents the growth hormone gene.Part b shows the restriction map of the 4.3 kbp EcoRI fragment from AGh2 that was subcloned in pBR322. Boxed regions represent the exon regions on the gene. Part c shows the structure of the insert sequence from the growth hormone cDNA clone,pLS23, which is disclosed inEP A 0067026. Figure 2 shews the structure of Ele pAGh2R2 and the pXGh2R3 genomic subclones. For orientation purposes, the tetracycline and ampicillin resistance genes, as well as a few restriction enzyme sites, are shown on the pBR322 DNkpor tion shown in solid black . The open boxes represent the exon regions in the growth hormone gene sequence. BGH genomic clone pAGH2R2, NRRL B 15154, contains the entire bovine growth hormone gene as well as several hundred nucleotides of 5 and 3 flanking sequence. The given nucleotide sequence of the bovine growth hormone gene shows that it is approximately 1.8 kbp kilobase pairs in length and contains five exons and four intervening sequences. The 5 flanking region contains a TATA box 88 base pairs upstream from the first AUG see Gannon et al, Nature 278 1979 428 434. The first exon is primarily 51 untranslated sequence and contains only four amino acid codons. The four intervening sequences are all roughly the same size and contain the characteristics GT and AG dinucleotides at their 5 and 3 boundaries see Breathnach et al, Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 75 1978 4853 4857. There is an AATAAA sequence on the 3 untranslated region located 18 nucleotides upstream from the polyadenylation site. This hexanucleotide is found in the 3 untranslated regions of most eukaryotic genes seeProudfoot et al, Nature 263 1976 211 214. The nucleotide has been shown to be involved in the polyadenylation reaction Fitzgerald, J., and Shenk, T. 1981 Cell 24, 251 260 . The utility of the BGH genomic clones of the subject invention is readily apparent to a person skilled in the art. They can be used to direct the synthesis of BGH in a suitable eukaryotic host, e.g., cell lines and organisms. Such hosts are well known to persons skilled in the art. Also, the clones can be used to make genomic 8GH nucleotide sequence which can be used to clone into other vectors and hosts by methods well known in the art. The above disclosure with the possession of the genomic clones enables a person skilled in the art to practice the claimed invention.However, to foster a better understanding of this art, there fo7lows a disclosure of procedures employed to prepare the key genomic clones of the subject invention.Example 1 Genomic. DNA Preparation An adult bovine pituitary 2.2 g was obtained and was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was ground. to a powder in a chilled mortar and pestle and was then immediately diges.ted with 100 vg ml proteinase K EM Biochemicals at 50 C in 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 8, 0..1 M Nail, 0.01 M EDTA and 0.5X SDS.When all the tissue was dissolved approximately 4 hours , the sample was extracted three times with Tris saturated phenol and three times with CHCl3, then ethanol precipitated. The precipitated material was slowly resuspended over the course of several days at 40C in 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 8.0 and 0.001 M EDTA. The DNA concentration was estimated using the diphenylamine technique Burton, K. 1968 in Methods in Enzymolosy L. Grossman and K. Moldave, eds.. Vol. 12, part B, pp. 163 166. Academic press, New York . Using agarose gel electrophoresis, the size of the DNA was estimated to be greater than 80 kbp. Placental DNA was a gift from Dr. Les Hoffman University ofWisconsin . 6 5 g of frozen bovine placental tissue was placed in liquid nitrogen, powdered and then immediately digested with 100 ug ml proteinase K Beckman in 0.1 M EDTA and 1 sarkosyl at 55 C.. The solution was extracted with a 1 1 mixture of NETS 0.1 M Nail, 0.005 MEDTA, 0.01 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5 and 0.5 SDS saturated phenol CIAA CIAA is 0H013 isoamyl alcohol 24 1 followed by two extractions in CIAO.

Approximately 4 x 10 phage were preadsorbed to 2 x 1010 cells K802 i n 5 ml of SM buffer 0.1 MNaCl, 0.01 M MgS04, 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01 gelatin at 37 C for 15 minutes.The phage cell mixture was then added to 500 ml ofNZCYM broth 10 9 NZamine, 5 g NaCl, 5 9 yeast extract, 1 g casamino acids, 10 ml 1 M MgS04 per liter pH to 7.5 with NaOH and was vigorously agitated at 37 C for 12 hours. 1.5 ml of CHO13 was then added, followed by centrifugation for 10 mintues at 5000 rpm to remove any cells and debris. After dissolving 50 g of polyethylene glycol 6000 Sigma and Z5 .2 g of NaCl in the supernatant, the sample was incubated 2 3 hours at 4 and then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes. The phage pellet was redissolved in 5 ml of SM buffer.Cesium chloride was added 0.75 9 per ml volume and the sample was centrifuged to equilibrium in an SW41 rotor at 28,000 rpm. The phage band was removed through the side of the tube with a 22 guage needle and dialyzed in 0.01 M tris HCl, pH 7..5, 0.001 M EDTA.Example 3 Extraction of Bacteriophage DNA SOS and EDTA were added to an aliquot of the phage suspension to final concentrations of 0.1 and 0.002 M respectively. After heating for 15 minutes at 650C, the sample was extracted once with an equal volume of Tris saturated phenol followed by two chloroform extractions. The DNA was then purified with a single ethanol precipitat ion. Example 4 Preparation of Charon 28 Arms Charon 28 DNA was digested with Bam HI 1 unit of enzyme per iig of DNA , then placed on a 38.5 ml 10 40X sucrose gradient 1 M NaCl, 0.01 M Tris HOl, pH 8 . The gradient was centrifuged for 24 hours at 26,000 rpm in an SW 25 rotor. Fractions containing the arms identified by agarose gel electrophoreses were pooled, dialyzed against 0.01 M Trls HCl, pH 8, 0.0005 M EDTA and were then concentrated to 0.5 ml with sec butanol. After ethanol precipitation, the sample was stored in water at 80 C. Example 5 Preparation of Bovine insert DNA for Cloning Genomic placental DNA was partially digested with the restriction enzyme Mbo I. The resulting fragments were size fractionated on a 10 402 sucrose gradient 1M NaCl, 0.005 M EDTA . Fractions containing 15 18 kbp fragments were pooled and ethanol precipitated. The DNA was resuspended in water and stored at 80 C. Example 6 Preparation of X Packaging Extracts The two complementary X lysogenic bacterial strains, BHB 2688 andBHB 2690, as well as the procedure used is described in Hohn, B. 1S79 in Methods in Enzymoloqy R. Wu ed. Vol. 68, pp. 229 309,Academic Press, New York. A. Sonic Extracts A 500 ml culture of BHB 2690 was grown to an A600 0.3 at 32 C in NZ broth 10 g NZamine, 5 g NaCl, 2 g MgCl2 6H20 per liter, pH 7.5 . The endogenous phage was induced by heating at 450C for 15 minutes and was then further incubated for 3 hours at 37 C. The cells were pelleted b.y centrifugation, then resuspended in 3.6 ml of sonication buffer 0.02 M Tris HCl, pH 8, 0.001.M EDTA, 0.003 M MgCl2, 0.005M ss mercaptoethanol . The sample was pulse sonicated until clear, then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm.An equal volume of cold sonication buffer and 1 6 volume of packaging buffer 0.006 M Tris HOl, pH 8, 0.05 M spermidine, 0.05 M putrescine, 0..02 M MgCl2, 0.02 M ATP and 0.03 N B mercaptoethanol were added to the supernatant. The solution was frozen in liquid nitrogen in 15 iil aliquots.. B. Freeze thaw Lysates A 1500 ml culture of BHB 2688 was grown and induced according to the procedure described above for BHB2690. The cells were then peljetedand resuspended in 3 ml of 10 sucrose, 0.05 M Tris HOl, pH 7..5 and 0.5 ml aliquots of the solution were distributed among six 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. To each tube, 25 yl of a 2 mg ml lysozyme in 0.25M Tris HCl, pH 7..5 solution was added. After mixing well,. the solutions were fraze.n in liquid nitrogen and allowed to thaw on ice. Packaging buffer 25 stl was added to each tube before centrifugation for 1 hour at 20,000 rpm. The supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen in 10 l aliquots.Example 7 Ligation of the Bovine Insert DNA to the Charon 28 Arms and In Vitro Packaging A 2 1 molar ratio of arms insert was empirically determined to give the best results. 3.1 g of 1 arms DNA and 0.9 g of bovine insert DNA were combined and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase at 16 C for 4 6 hours in 0.01 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, O.01 M MgCl2, 0.006 MKCl, 0.001 M ATP and 0.01 M dithiothritol. The DNA was packaged intoX capsids in vitro by incubating 60 minutes at room temperature 1 5 1 of the ligated DNA sample with 15 vl of the sonic extract and 6 10vl of the freeze thaw lysate. A total of 2 x 10 pfu s plaque forming units were generated in this manner.Example 8 Library Amplification and Screening A total of 900,000 pfu s were amplified according to the plate lysate technique described by Enquist and Sternberg Enquist, L., andSternberg, N. 1Ç79 in Methods in Enzymology R. Wu ed. Vol. 68, pp. 229 309, Academic Press, New York . Approximately 700,000 pfu s from the amplified library were screened using the Benton and Davis method Benton, W.D., and Davis,R. 1977 Science 196, 180 182 . To do this, recombinant phage were initially plated at a very high density 300 plaques per cm on largeNZCYM plates 10 S NZamine, 5 g yeast extract, 1 g casamino acids, 10 ml 1 M MgS04 and 15 g bactoagar per liter, pH 7.5 . Duplicate impressions were made of the agarose surface on two Millipore nitrocellulose filters. The nitrocellulose filters were then processed as follows 1 minute in 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl 5 minutes in 1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 MTris HCl, pH 8 1 minute in 0.18 M NaCl, 0.01 M Na2HP04, 0.001 M EDTA.The phage DNA was fixed to the nitrocellulose by heating the filters for 2 hours at 800C in a vacuum oven. After the filters were prewashed for 60 minutes at 420C in 1 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris HCl, pH 8, 0.001 M EDTA and 0.1 SDS, they were prehybridized for at least 4 hours at 420C in 50X formamide, 5XSSPE 1XSSPE is 0.09 M Nail, 0.005 M Na2HPO4 and 0.005 M EDTA, pH 7 , 1X Denhardt s solution 0.02 polyvinyl pyrollidone 0.02 bovine serum albumin, 0.02X ficoll and 100 yg ml denatured salmon sperm DNA.Nick translated insert DNA from a bovine prolactin cDNA clone.and a growth hormone cDNA clone was then added directly to the prehybridization solution approximately 1.5 x 10 cpm ml of each insert and was allowed to hydrndize for 36 hours at 420C. The filters were washed according to the following sequence 4 washes in 2XSSC 0.1 SDS, 23 C, 15 minutes each one wash in lXSSC 0.1 SDS, 30 minutes, 65 C 2washes in 0.2XSSC O.lZ SDS, 45 60 minutes, 65 C.After drying the filters they were placed againstXAR 5 X ray film, sandwiched between two lightning plus intensifying screens and stored at 800C. Positive signals that were present at the same position on both filters were further screened at lower plating densities and were ultimately plaque purified.Example 9 Subcloning of Restriction Fragments into pBR322 The technique used for subcloning of the 4.3 kbp EcoRI restriction fragment from the genomic clone xGh2 into pBR322 was similar to that described in Yen, P., and Davidson, N. 1980 Cell 22, 137 148. Briefly, AGh2 DNA was digested with EcoRI, heated to 65 C for 10 minutes to inactivate the enzyme and then ethanol precipitated.pBR322 was digested with EcoRI, subjected to bacterial alkaline phosphatase treatment, phenol extracted and then ethanol precipitated.Aliquots of the digested AGh2 pBR322 were combined and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase in 0.01 M Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01 M MgCl2, 0.006 M KC1, 0..001 M AtP and 0.01 M dithiothreitol. The ligated material was then used directly to transform E. coli HB101 VillaKomaroff, L., Efstratiadis, A., Broome, S., Lomedico, P., Tizard, R.,Naber, S.P., Chick, W.L., and Gilbert, W. 1S78 Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 75, 3727 3731 . The colony screening technique described byGrunstein and Hogness Grunstein, M., and Hogness, D.S. 1S75 Proc.Natl. Acad.. Sci. USA 72, 3961 3965 was used to positively select for the desired clones. Example 10 DNA Sequence Analysis The dideoxy chain terminator sequencing technique Sanger, F.,Nicklen, S., and Coulson, A. R. 1S77 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74, 5463 5467 was used to sequence the entire bovine growth hormone gene. Deoxyinosine 5 triphosphate Sigma was used in some dideoxy sequencing reactions instead of deoxyguanosine 5 triphosphate in order to resolve some compressed areas on the sequence. Sequencing templates were prepared by subcloning restriction fragments of the genomic sequence into the BamHI, PstI and Smal sites of the M13 cloning vector mp8. The universal sequencing primer P L Biochemicals was used in the individual reactions.
