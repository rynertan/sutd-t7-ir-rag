# Recombinant DNA, microorganisms containing same and their use in the production of amylases.

## Abstract
Recombinant DNA has been developed which is derived from the plasmid pUB110. This plasmid comprises a gene coding for resistance to kanamycin or to analogous antibio tics inactivated by the nucleotidyl transferase enzyme. The recombinant DNA containing an amylase coding gene is prepared by the in vitro process of cleaving DNA derived from a donor microorganism and combining the resulting DNA fragments comprising the amylase coding gene with a similarly cleaved vector which is plasmid pUB110. This recombinant DNA may then be introduced into a host microorganism and the resulting genetically en gineered microorganism has been found to have enhanced stability and high copy numbers. The host microorganism employed is preferably Bacillus subtilis and the invention is particularly suitable for the industrial scale production of the alpha amylase of Bacillus megaterium.
