# CUTTING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
This invention provides a method of and apparatus for cutting within the confines of a passage. The method com prises introducing into the passage a cutting apparatus, sup plying to the cutting apparatus fluid under pressure, supplying separately to the cutting apparatus a particulate abrasive ma terial suspended in a fluid, mixing at least part of the fluid under pressure with the particulate abrasive material suspended in a fluid, and directing the mixture of fluid and particulate abrasive material under pressure onto a surface to be cut. The appara tus comprises a body portion 1, 21 , a head portion 2, 25 ro tatable relative to the body portion 1, 21 and comprising at least one cutting nozzle 11, 25 means 3, 34 for connecting the apparatus to a source of fluid under pressure, means 5, 41 for connecting the apparatus to a source of particulate ab rasive material suspended in a fluid, means 10 or 32, 37 for rotating the head portion, and venturi means 14 or 26, 30 for mixing the particulate abrasive material suspended in a fluid with the fluid under pressure. The apparatus preferably com prises drive nozzles 8, 53 whereby part of the fluid under pressure can be directed rearwardly and outwardly of the ap paratus to impart drive to the apparatus and an inflatable collar 46 which can be inflated to locate the apparatus in a passage during a cutting operation.
