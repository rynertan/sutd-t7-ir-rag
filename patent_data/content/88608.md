# MARINE RISER TENSIONER

## Abstract
Motion compensating apparatus maintains a tension load on a marine riser supported from a floating platform which is subject to movement by wave action and the like. Bending movements induced by the roll and pitch of the vessel are de coupled by a resilient bearing member 38 having an annular section of a substantially spherical or conical laminated body of superposed layers of an elastic material 74 and 3 relatively inelastic material 76 . A tension load is applied to the riser by a hydraulic actuator 40 which is supported by the resilient bear ing member 38 . The actuator includes a displacement com pensating cylinder chamber 55 having an adjustable volume of hydraulic fluid prsented to a piston 52 in the cylinder for supporting the upper end 72 of the marine riser. The displace ment of fluid in the cylinder 55 varies in response to the heave of the vessel to maintain a positive lifting force on the marine riser. An accumulator assembly 88 is connected to the pres sure chamber 55 of the hydraulic actuator for supplying hy draulic fluid to and for receiving hydraulic fluid from the pres sure chamber in response to changes in its volume. Hydraulic fluid leakage past the actuator seals 56, 60, 67, 68 is mon itored through a fluid circuit 65 84 including pressure switches 95, 97 and leakage flow indicators 103, 101 .
