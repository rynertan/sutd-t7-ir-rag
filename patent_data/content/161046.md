# Automatic wire threading with a tubular electrode in a TW E machine.

## Abstract
AT automatic threading of wire 3 through a workpiece 4 without the need for a preformed through hole therein is achieved on a TW traveling wire electroerosion machine by utilizing a tubular electroerosion electrode 64 positioned in axial alignment with a wire threading path. Wire 4 from a wire supply is introduced into the tubular electrode 64 so as to extend through a tool holder 75 therefor. The tubular electrode 64 is advanced along the wire threading path into and through the workpiece 4 while electroerosively forming a bore therein. Wire 4 is dispensed from the supply to allow wire 4 to move out of the tubular electrode 64 while the latter at least partially remains in the bore into wire outlet side of the cutting zone towards a takeup assembly. The tubular electrode 64 may then be retracted along the wire threading path from the workpiece 4 while leaving wire in the bore finished in the workpiece 4 .
