# Polyacrylate rubber modified vinylidene chloride copolymer compositions in the form of powder or latex blends and process for making the blend compositions.

## Abstract
A blend of A a vinylidene chloride copolymer and B a vinylidene chloride copolymer polyacrylate rubber latex, prepared by emulsion polymerization of a mixture of vin ylidene chloride monomer, a selected comonomer and a cross linked polyacrylate rubber obtained from specified acrylate monomers, improves the low temperature strength properties of articles made from the modified copolymer compositions.
