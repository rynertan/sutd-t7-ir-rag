# Sliding current collector.

## Abstract
A sliding current collector comprises a pair of sliding members 1 11, 2 12 which are slidable relative to each other for supply and reception of current through sliding surfaces 3, 4 of the paired sliding members wherein the two sliding members are made of conductive ceramics 1C, 2C , and the sliding surface of each of the sliding members has a film surface 3 or 4 made of a soft conductive material which is softer than the conductive ceramics so that the sliding current collector can suppress variations in contact voltage drop across the sliding surfaces.
