# Fibre optic cable arrangements.

## Abstract
A fibre optic cable is helically wound on to an overhead high voltage conductor, and has an electrically nontracking outer jacket and is filled with protective material, or has a conductive outer jacket. The cable is guided off the conduc tor inside a conductive housing, and thence to earth potential along the inside of a nontracking shedded or convoluted tube.
