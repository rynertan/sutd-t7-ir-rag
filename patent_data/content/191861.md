## Description
DESCRIPTION SYSTEM PROGRAM MODIFICATION METHODTechnical Field This invention relates to a system program modification method and, more particularly, to a method of modifying a system program of an automatic programming apparatus which creates NC programs by using data created in a predetermined language for specifying a tool path.Background Art An automatic programming apparatus includes a control main frame, a graphic display unit, a printer and an input output unit such as a magnetic cassette tape or floppy disc and is very useful as it is capable of creating an NC program simply, rapidly and accurately. The main frame of the automatic programming apparatus is constituted by a computer.If software a system program for NC program creation is stored beforehand in an internal main memory and a group of data a part program specifying a tool path created in a predetermined language such as APT automatically programmed tools or FAPT are thereafter entered in accordance with a predetermined rule, then the apparatus will subsequently create and output, automatically, an NC program conforming to EIA or ISO codes. System programs differ depending upon the form of machining, such as turning, 2 1 2 dimensional milling, 3 dimensional milling, punching, wire cut electrical discharge machining and the like. A system program is created in conformance with each form of machining and is stored in an external storage medium such as, for example, a floppy disc or magnetic cassette tape .Accordingly, when automatic programming is performed, the prescribed system program is taken from the external storage medium and stored in the main memory device of the automatic programming apparatus, after which automatic programming processing is executed. There are cases where it is desired to modify a portion of a system program for the purpose of improving it or for some other reason. When such is the case, the conventional practice is for the maker of the apparatus to create a new system program which incorporates the modification, store the program on a floppy disc and rewrite the old system program stored on the floppy disk possessed by the user by using the new system program stored on the floppy disc of the maker. Though another method would be to prepare a number of floppy discs storing the new system program and make a disc for disc exchange, this approach is undesirable because of the high cost involved. Thus, in the conventional modification method, the entirety of the old system program stored on the floppy disc in the user s possession is replaced by the new system program. Therefore, even if parameters have the same values that they did in the old system program, the user must again set these parameters for the new system program after it has been substituted for the old. The reason for this is that some data contained in the system program provided by the maker of the apparatus are given in the form of parameters so as to enable users to individually set their own values, and a system program will not operate effectively unless these parameters are set.There are a number of such parameters, examples of which are as follows 1 parameters specifying whether NC data are created in conformance with ISO or EIA codes 2 parameters specifying whether NC data are created in an incremental or absolute format 3 parameters specifying whether a tool path is displayed in the form of a broken line 4 parameters specifying minimum setting units 5 parameters specifying whether a decimal point is to be applied to numerical data and the like. For an operator to set these parameters requires a considerable amount of time. Thus, the conventional modification method involves a troublesome operation in that the user must set parameters whenever a system program is modified. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a system program modification method which does not require the resetting of parameters even when a system program is modified. Another object of the present invention is to provide a system program modification method in which only one module constituting a system program can be replaced by a separate new module.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention provides a method of modifying a system program of an automatic programming apparatus which creates NC programs by using data created in a predetermined language for specifying a tool path. The method includes storing a system program in a first external storage medium upon being arranged in the form of plural modules classified according to function and a table storing at least a starting position of each module and length of data storing in a second external storage medium a single up to date module and a control program for replacing an old module stored in the first external storage medium with the up to date module storing the contents of the second external storage medium in a memory of the automatic programming apparatus setting the first external storage medium in the automatic programming apparatus retrieving the starting position of the old module from the table under the control of the control program stored in the memory and successively writing in the new module from this position to replace the old module with the up to date module.Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is an external view of an automatic programming apparatus to which the present invention can be applied, Fig. 2 is a block diagram of the automatic programming apparatus, Fig. 3 is a view for describing the configuration of a system program, Fig.4 is a flowchart of processing according to the present invention, and Fig. 5 is a view for describing the present invention.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention Fig. 1 is an external view of an automatic programming apparatus to which the present invention can be applied, Fig. 2 is a block diagram of the automatic programming apparatus, and Fig. 3 is a view for describing the configuration of a system program. A main frame 11 has a top side provided with a printer 12 and a front side provided with a CRT display unit 13. Disposed in front of the CRT display unit 13 is a keyboard 14 on which there are provided an array of keys 14a such as character keys, numeric keys and function keys. Disposed at the side of the CRT display unit 13 is a floppy disc unit 15. Numeral 12a denotes a recording paper on which printing is performed by the printer 2. Numerals 15a, 15b denote floppy discs. The main frame 11 is constituted by a microcomputer and, as shown in Fig. 2, has a processor lla, a ROM llb and a working memory lld. The ROM llb stores a loading program, under the control of which a system program is read out of a floppy disc and stored in the RAM llc. The processor lla executes processing under the control of the system program, causes the CRT display unit 13 to display the results of processing and various instructions, executes prescribed processing based on data and commands inputted from the keyboard 14, creates an NC program and either prints out the program via the printer 12 or records the program on a floppy disc. As shown in Fig. 3, the system program includes at least a plurality of modules M1 M4 and a vector tableBT. Module M1, which is for a monitor, is a portion of the program for managing such resources as the CRT display. Utility module M2 is a utility portion of the program, language translator module M3 is a language program portion for language translation used when specifying a tool path, and postprocessor module M4 is a program portion for creating an NC program by using entered data. The monitor module M1 includes parameters set on the user side, and the postprocessor module M4 has a suitable amount of blank space. The vector table BT stores storage starting positions and data lengths corresponding to the names of the modulesM1 M4. Next, reference will be had to the flowchart ofFig. 4 and the explanatory view of Fig. 5 to describe processing for a case where an old postprocessor moduleM4 stored on the floppy disc in the possession of the user is replaced by a new postprocessor module M4 . Note that the characters a h denoting the following steps are attached to the flowchart in Fig.4. a The apparatus maker prepares a floppy discFDn see Fig. 5 having 1 a vector table BT , 2 the new postprocessor module M4 , and 3 a control program MRP for replacing the old postprocessor module M4 stored on a user s floppy disc FDo see Fig. 5 with the new postprocessor module M4 . Note that the vector table BT stores the name of the module to be modified as well as the corresponding storage starting position of this module and its data length. b Next, the floppy disc FDn is set in the floppy disc unit 15 see Figs. 1 and 2 , after which its contents BT , M4 , MRP are read and stored in the main memory RAM llc of the automatic programming apparatus main frame 11 under the control of the loading program stored in the ROM llb. c Thereafter, the user s floppy disc FDo is set in the floppy disc unit 15. d This is followed by pressing an execute key 14b on the keyboard 14. e In response to depression of the execute key, the processor lla is placed under the control of the control program MRP, which is for effecting module replacement, and subsequently executes module replacement processing. Specifically, on the basis of the vector table BT stored in RAM llc, the processor identifies the name of the module to be modified the postprocessor module in the present example . Next, the processor retrieves the storage starting position of the module to be modified, namely the postprocessor module M4, from the vector table BT of the floppy disc FD . f When the storage starting position has been retrieved, the new post processsor module M4 already stored in the RAM llc is thereafter read out and successively written into the floppy disc FDo from the abovementioned starting position. g The processor counts up n by one count in accordance withEMI8.1 tb n SEP SEP 1 SEP SEP n tb where the initial value of n is 1 each time one item of data is written into the floppy disc FD . h It is then determined whether n has become equal to the data length m4 of the postprocessor module M4 stored in the vector table BT . It should be noted that the new postprocessor module M4 is prepared in such a manner that the data length becomes m4, inclusive of the blank portion. If n m4 holds, the processing from step f onward is repeated if n m4 hoids, processing for rewriting the module is ended. Thus, according to the present invention as described above, a system program can be modified in module units. Accordingly, by including data that have been set for parameters in a module that is not to be altered, such as the monitor module, it is possible to dispense with the need to perform the parameter setting operation whenever the system program is modified.
