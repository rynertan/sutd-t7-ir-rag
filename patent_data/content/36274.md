## Description
METHODS OF MONITORING MICRO ORGANISMS AND MEDIA FOR CULTUREBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method of monitoring micro organists. iviore particulary, the invention concerns methods of monitoring micro organisms impedametrically, i.e. by measuring changes in electrical impedance of nutrient media upon which such micro organisms are grown. The invention also concerns media which are used in carrying out the methods. Description of the Prior Art Heretofore, identification of microorganisms have usually relied on a biological character test in which discriminative identification of the rnicroorganism is primarily trade on the basis of changes in color of an indicator as used.For example, in the case where organisms which are of interest and importance from the medical or clinical stand point, a variety of indicators and reagents required for the niicro biological character identification are added to nutrient agar media on which sampled organisms are inoculated to be subsequently cultured for 18 to 48 hours, wherein changes in color of the indicators as brought about by metabolic products discharged by the micro organisms as the organisms achieve growth are visually observed to confirm the identity of the organisms. The hitherto known methods of identifying the micro organisms suffer many shortcomings. For example, a lot of time is required for a sampled organism to achieve growth sufficiently for affording the identification. As the conseouence, in the case of medical diagnosis such long delay ray force the physician to blindly initiate therapy without positive confirmation of the identity of the offending organisms, giving rise to a serious problem. Further, visual observation and discrimination of the cultured specimens require troublesome procedures of time consumption and nevertheless provide sometimes the results of lessened reliability. Recently, there have been issued reports on the methods of autD matically and rapidly determining the organism by impedarnetrically rronitoring the growth of organisms. Generally speaking, the impedar etrical method is based on the fact that as the living organism grows in a liquid nutrient medium, they take in nutrients and discharge waste products, such process being generally known as the metabolic process, resulting in that electrical impedance of the medium undergoes corresponding variations.It has already been experimentally established that when suitable nutrient medium is employed, the rate of increase in the electrical impedance of a medium and the number of organists correspond proportionately to the increase in the quantity of metabolic products produced as the organisms achieve the growth. Usually, the impedance tends to be decreased as the growth of organism proceeds. In the case of the impedametrical method, which is a typical one of the hitherto known automatic and rapid organism identifying methods, the metabolic products of organism as cultured are detected as electro chemical changes of the whole nutrient media to thereby determine the rate of growth of the organism. However, because the metabolic process of organisms is generally of complex or complicated nature, the resultant impedance curve involves complexities in evaluation thereof. For this reason, the impedametrical method is not widely and generally adopted in the area of clinical bacteriology but restricted in application to the tests of antibiotic sensitivity and high speed measurement of the number of bacteria or organisms in urine.Although application of the impedametric method to the identification of organisms or bacteria has been suggested, there have been yet no concrete proposal. At present, such application is considered to be difficult in practice. In reality, the impedametrical process is not made use of at all in the test con sutilization ofi cerning carbohydrates among the biological character tests. SUS WRY OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention is therefore to provide a method of impedametrically monitoring micro organisms which is immune to the dr W backs of the hitherto known method and which is capable of identifying the organism with a sufficiently high speed for practical applications on the basis of particular variations in the electrical impedance of a nutrient or supporting medium. Another object of the invention is to provide novel media for use in carrying out the methods according to the invention. The invention starts from the experimentally observed and confirmed fact that the impedance of a whole medium of a certain nature or com position is decreased initally as metabolic products are increased, which is followed, after elapse of a predetermined time, by increasing in impedance. It is believed that the increasing in impedance occurs in the metabolic process of carbohydrates. In view of the above and other objects which will become more apparent as description proceeds, it is proposed according to an aspect of the invention that variation in electrical impedance of a medium having a predetermined composition which variation is brought about by the growth of organism or bacteria and includes decrease and increase in impedance is measured and utilized through evaluation in examining the organisms cultured on the medium. According to another aspect of the invention, it is proposed that the rates of decrease and increase in impedance for a unit time as well as time durations in which the impedance changes occur and the rate of decrease in impedance immediately before impedance is subsequently increased are detected to thereby allow identification of the micro organism to be effected in a much facilitated manner. According to a further aspect of the invention, quantities of various carbohydrates taken in by organisms are detected as variations in impedance of a nutrient medium to thereby identify the organisms on the basis of the results of detenrdnation rrade as to whether the organisms are positive or negative to carbohydrates. According to still another aspect of the invention, there is pr vided a method of exarraning decarboxylation capabilities of aminoacids through the impedametrical process. Above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will become clearer from the following description of preferred em bodiments of the invention. The description makes reference to the accompanying drawings.ERIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 shows schematically an equivalent electric circuit of a medium in a cultivating and measuring cell Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing an impedance measuring instru ment used in carrying out the present invention Fig. 3 shows a cultivating and measuring cell in a perspective view Figs. 4 A to 4 F graphically illustrate inoedance variations brought about by enteric bacteria when glucose is used as nutrient Figs. 5 A to 5 C graphically illustrate impedance variations brought about by micro organisms other than enteric bacteria when glucose is utilised as nutrient Figs. 6 A to 6 D graphically illustrate variation in impedance of media as a function of dissolved concentrations of disodium hydrogen phosphate Figs. 7 A to 7 D graphically illustrate impedance variations as a function of dissolved concentrations of sodium chloride Fig. 8 graphically illustrates variation in impedance of a medium constituted by a basal medium added with only electrolyte components Figs. 9 A and 9 B graphically illustrate variation in impedance as a function of dissolved concentrations of glucose Figs. 10 A to 10 I graphically illustrate variations in impedance when various carbohyarates are utilized as nutrient Figs. 11 A to 11 I graphically illustrate impedance variations when various arninoacids are utilized as nutrient and Fig. 12 is to graphically illustrate an example of evaluating a curve representing variation in impedance.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In an experiment conducted by the present inventor concerning the growths of enteric bacteria with carbohydrates being utilized as nutrient, there was observed phenomena described below. At first, a basle medium Bacto Peptone available from Difco Company was added and mixed with a predetermined quantity of glucose to prepare a medium for use in identification. Since glucose or dextrose is a material which has a low electrical conductivity and exhibits a much higher impedance as compared with that of the components of the basal medium, increase and or decrease in impedance which is directly ascribable to decrease of glucose due to consumption there of by enteric bacteria could not be detected. In other words, no noticeable variation or change occurred in impedance of the supporting medium regardless of the growth of bacteria.Influence to impedance of the medium exerted by organic acids resulted from metabolic activity of bacteria could be observed only slightly. However, when a certain proper quantity of sodium hydrogen phosphate Na2HPO4 is admixed to the basal medium mentioned above, inherent impedance of the medium was decreased. As the result, organic acids produced through bacterial metabolism from glucose could be detected with a significantly high level, making it possible to discriminate clearly difference in impedance variation or change due to the growth of bacteria.Similar pheno,menon could be observed in the culture medium which was added with inorganic salts such as sodium chloride, as will be hereinafter described in more detail in conjunction with examples. Now, referring to Fig. 1 each shows an electrically equivalent circuit of cultivation medium contained within a cultivating and measuring cell used in the experimentsdescribed just above, reference numeral 1 denotes an impedance component provided by the basal medium which contains scarcely sodium salts such as sodium. chloride, sodium hydrogen phosphate or the like and electrolyte cor.pounds such as potassium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts or the like. Numeral 2 represents an impedance component provided by carbohydrates including glucose rannitol, and other carbohydrates. Numeral 3 represents an impedance component provided by inorganic salts including sodium chloride, sodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate and the like. The inorganic salt impedance component 3, the basal medium impedance component 1 and the carbohydrate impedance component 2 constitute medium impedance of the nutrient medium. Numeral 4 represents subtractive impedance provided by metabolic products including organic acids which exhibit lower impedance than the medium impedance mentioned above.Numeral 5 represents additive impedance provided by the metabolic pro ducts including organic acid, carbonic acid gases, hydrogen gas, water, ethanol and the like. It will be readily appreciated that the additive impedance component 5 and the subtractive impedance component 4 are ascribable to the progressive growth of bacteria. The impedance components describec above are composed of a pure resistance component for electrical conductivity and an electrostatic capacitance component of an aqueous electrolytic solution of the supporting medium, wherein the resistance and the capacitance are connected in parallel with each other. The supporting medium of the composition represented by the equivalent circuit diagram shown in ri . 1 is inoculated with bacteria and incubated at a predetermined temperature. Then, growth of bacteria begins. As the growth proceeds, metabolic products are discharged.These metabolic products having respective electrochemical constants cause impedance of the media to be decreased anu or increased. Thus, ten the inlpedance value of the mecium is small before the growth oI bacteria benins, the subtractive impe ance component due to the metabolic products which is effective to decrease impedance of the medium as a whole is difficult to be detected.On the contrary, the additive impedance component which is ascribable to the products resulted from the metabolic activity of bacteria and effective to increase inipedance of the medium as a whole becomes easier to be detected. On the other hand, in case the medium exhibits a high impedance value before the start of the multiplication of organists, the subtractive impedance component ascribable to the metabolic products is easy to be detected, while the additive impedance component becomes difficult to be detected.In this conjunction, it should be mentioned that the variation in impedance will proceed only in the sense of decreasing in the case of the conventionally employed media. by way of example, when coliform bacilli are incubated in aerobic state, the metabolic products of glucose supplied as nutrient will contain arganic acids such as acetic acid, succinic acid, latic acid or the like and additionally carbonic acid gas and water. Acetic acid and the like which are weak electrolytes exhibit relatively low electric conductivity and play a noticeable role in increasing impedance of the medium. The sane applies true for carbonic acid gas and water.Further, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid and the like are ionized in the aqueous solution. Wnen sodium ions l.a are present, carboxylate ions ROOO will combine with sodium ions to form RCOO Na ions, in voling increase in the impedance value. In other words, Then glucose or dextrose is ade use of the metabolic process proceeds in the sense to increase impedance of the medium as a whole after a predetermined time has lapsed from the start of cultivation. tor the reasons described above, organic acids contained in the metabolic product can be detected as an increase in impedance with a high sensitivity and reliability by adding sodium hydrogen phosphate as well as strong electrolytes such as sodium, potasium salts or the like to the medium. The inventor of the present application conducted similar experiments on several species of bacteria and obtained similar results.It is thus expected that substantially same or similar results can be obtained for other bacteria for which glucose can be utilized as nutrient. Further, under the same experimental conditions, different species of micro organisms give rise to generation of impedance varia tion patterns each unique to each of organisms. Thus, it is possible to identify micro organisms or bacteria cn the basis of different impedance variation patterns. Additionally, by virtue of the fact that degree of utilization of various carbohydrates including. other suec s in addition to glucose can be detected as unique or peculiar variations in impedance, it is possible to carry out the hitherto kno.n biological character identification test with the aid of the impedemetrical process according to the invention. Finally, decarboxylase test which has hitherto been adopted as one of the biological character tests tri is important for identifying enteric bacteria can be carried out in a much facilitated and reliable manner by making use of the peculiar variation or change in impedance ascribable to the use of glucose as nutrient. With the terms decarboxylase test , it is intended to mean the test in which a medium added with proper quantities of grape sugar and aminoacid is inoculated with bacteria for incubation. Then, certain species of bacteria will, after acids have been produced through fermentation of glucose take in aminoacid and bring about decarboxylating reaction. Thus, change in color of an indicator as added allows bacteria to be identified. However, it should be noted that any noticeable impedance variation will not make appearance if the media used heretofore in the decarboxylase test is employed. It has been found that difference in decarboxylation becomes significant only when weak electrolyte such as do sodium hydrogen phosphate or the like salt is added to the hitherto used medium. ben bacteria are cultured in the medium added with sodium hydrogen phosphate, acids are procuced by bacteria from glucose after the growth has been initiate, involving decrease in the impendance value of the medium which is followed by an increase in the i.,pedar.ce value after a predetermined tir.,e has elapsed. However, when bacteria take in aminoacid after the acid production, the impedance value will not be increased but continuously being decreased. This phenomenon tray be explained by the fact that when bacteria take in amino acid, the latter is decomposed into carbonic acid gas and amines involving decrease in impedance by cancelling out action of RCOONa ions. In this way, when a medium added with sodium hydrogen phosphate is used, the decarboxylation can be detected in a form of an impedance decrease pattern without fail. Other strong electrolyte salts than disodium hydrogen phosphate tray be used to the same effect. Similar results could be obtained from the same experiments performed on several species of bacteria. Thus, it is expected that substantially similar results can be obtained for other micro organisms or bacteria which take in aminoacid. On the basis of the obtained results, identity of bacteria can be determined. The culture medium according to the invention is constituted by of proteins a basal medium which includes hydrolyzate7as a main component and added with at least carbohydrates and salts and or arninoacid. The basal medium should preferably contain 2.5 to 10 gr l gram per litre of carbohydrates and 1.0 to 10 gr 1 of salts dissolved in distilled water. The basal medium functions as a nutrient source for the growth of micro organism and contains as wain components proteins such as peptones, triptones, meat extracts or the like which are used as aminoacid in bacteria. Carbohydrates are source of energy required for the growing of bacteria ana way contain monosaccharides such as glucose, dextrose , inositol, xylose, glycerols, arabinose, galactose, mannose, rhamnose, mannitol, sorbitol, adonitol or the like, disaccharides such as lactose, sucrose, trehalose, melibiose, cellobiose or the like, and polysaccharide such as raffinose, melezitose, dulcitol, amygdalin, salicin, fructose, levulose or the like. Salts as added serve to catch metabolic products discharged by bacteria in a medium to thereby present peculiar changes in impedance of the medium, and way primarily include inorganic strong electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, wagnesium, calcium and the like. Salt tray be a mixture containing two or more components described above. There way be applications where vitamins are additicnally added to the medium. In the following, the invention will te described in more concrete in conjunction with examples. 1 Types of bacteria and preparation of liquid phase inocula In the examples described hereinafter, experiments were made using nine types of enteric bacteria and other three types of bacteria as follows A. Enteric bacteria a. Escherichia coli coliform bacilli b. Serratia marcescens c. Klebsiella pneumonia Friedlaender s bacillus d. Klebsiella ozaenae e. Proteus vulgaris f. Enterobacter cloacae g. Proteus mirabilis h. Hafnia alvei i. Citrobacter freundiB. Other types of bacteria j. Staphylococcus aureus k.Streptococcus faecalis 1. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Inocula in liquid phase were pre arez through pure culture for 18 hours by using Heart Infusion Medium which is available from EikenChemistry Co. Ltd., in Japan. 10 1 of thus prepared inoculum was used for inoculation. 2 Types of carbohydrates Following eight types of carbohydrates were used. Glucose iennitol Inositol Sorbitol Rhamnose Sucrose Melibiose Arabinose 3 Types of aminoacids as employed Following three types of aminoacids were amployed. Alginine Lysine Ornithine 4 bolts Disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium, chloride were used. 5 Preparation of rr.edia The basal medium as used was Bacto Peptone 10 gr 1 available from Difco Company. The media used in the exemplary experiments include the basal medium itself medium , medium prepared by adding to the basal medium with 10 gr 1 of carbonydrate medium , medium prepared by adding to the basal mecium with 10 gr 1 of carbohydrate anc isodium hydrogen phosphate medium , medium prepared by adding to the basal medium with 10 gr 1 of carbohydrate and sodium chloride medium , and medium prepared by adding to the basal medium with 5 gr 1 of glucose, 2.5 gr 1 of disodium hydrogen phosphate and 10 gr 1 of aminoacid medium . The media employed was 2 ml in volume.Different concentrations of disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium chloride were em loyed. 6 Principle of impedance measurement and instrument The tool used for measuring the impecance variations brought about by the growth of bacteria was and instrument which is commerciallyInstruments availatle from japan Tectron Co. Lt , in Japan under the trade name Micro organism Culture Automatic Measuring Apparatus of Type Orga 6 Fig. 2 shows the measuring apparatus Orga 6 described above in a schematic block diagram. A sample cell 6 and a reference cell 7 are directly cor,nected in an A.C. excitation circuit.Voltages appearing across the sample cell 6 and the reference cell 7 are measured and the ratio of these voltages is arithmetically determined. The impedance ratio is determined from the above voltage ratio in terms of ZSt ZR.t VSt VP.t where ZR and VR represent impedance and voltage of the sample cell 6, respectively. Accordingly, change or variation in the impedance ratio at a time t from the time of inoculation is given by VSo VRo VSt VRt. Thus, the measured value is given by VSo VRo VSt VRt VSo VRo after having been normalized by a base value of VSo VRo.The measured value is arithmetically processed in an arithmetic operation circuit 8, whereby the impedance change as determined is recorded by a recording apparatus. Reference numeral 10 denotes a power supply source, and 11 and 12 denote amplifier circuits. 7 Cultivating and measuring cell A cell for cultivating and measuring bacteria as employed in the experimental examples is shown in Fig. 3. The cell comprises a plat square form 13 of about 20 mm on which a cylindrical body 14 of about 40 mm in height is fixedly and integrally secured. A pair of electrodes 16 and 16 fonred purely of gold are disposed on an inner bottom of time cylindrical body 14 with terminals 15 and 15 for the electrodes being provided on the platform 13. Thpedance value of medium is measured between the electrodes 16 and 16 . The cell is made of hard glass so as to be re usable after vapor sterilization at 121 C for 1S Irinutes. The conditions for measuring impedance are as follows Source frequency 1 kH Z Impendance Detection Sensitivity 10 in full scale Measuring P eriod 8 hours Hr. in full scale or 16 hours Hr. in in full scale Culture Temperature 350C Preincubation Period 30 minutes Min. Now, examples of the invention will be described below.Example 1 In this example, it has been experimentally ascertained how the change or variation in impedance which occurs in the medium as enteric bacteria grow by taking in glucose differs peculiarly in dependence on the types of media as well as the tyFes of bacteria. Six types of bacteria a to f enumerated herein above ere used.Those bacteria underwent pure cultures in Heart Infusion media stated before for 18 hours, respectively. Liquid inocula each of 10 1 were inoculated in respective specimen cells described below. Three types of the media , and were prepared each in duplicate for each type of bacteria. More specifically, three specimen cells were used. A first cell was charged with 2 ml of medium , the second specimen or sample cell was charged with 2ml of medium and the third was charged with 2 ml of rnedium . The media and t were added with 10 gr 1 of grape sugar. The medium was further added with 2.5 gr l of disodium hydrogen phosphate. On the conditions described above, bacteria were cultivated and impedance changes of the media ere measured by using the instrumentOrga 6. The impedance changes as recorded are shown in Figs. 4 A to 4 F . In the graphs shown in trieste figures, incubation period or time in hour is taken along the abscissa, while rate of impedance decrease is taken along the ordinate. Figs. 4 A shows the results of irpedance measurement for Escherichia coli, Fig. 4 B is for Serratia marcescens,Fig. 4 C is for Klebsiella pneumonia, Fig. 4 D is for Klebsiella ozaenae, Fig. 4 E is for Proteus vulgaris, and Fig. 4 F is forEnterobacter cloacae.In these figures, attached reference numeral 1 represents the case where tkD medium is used, and numeral 2 repre sents the use of the medium while numeral 3 represents the use of the medium As will te appreciated from these graphs, in the case of the medium Q2 which is prepared by adding only 10 gr 1 of glucose to the basal medium, utilization of sugar does not appear in the form of appreciable impedance change but involves merely L.pedance decrease similar to that of the basal medium . In contrast, in the case of the medium which has been prepared by adding 2.5 gr 1 of disodium hydrogen phosphate to the basal medium in addition to 10 gr l of glucose there r ke appearance very significant impedance changes for all the types of bacteria, each impedance change being peculiarly characteristic of each bacterium. This means that degree of utilization of glucose differs in dependence on the totes of bacteria.In conclusion, it can be said that as bacteria growl, the impedance of each of the associated media is decreased in the initial phase in common to all the three types of media, and that after elapse of a predetermined time two to five hours increasing in impedance takes place only in the case of medium . Example 2 Experiments similar to those mentioned above in combination with Emample 1 were performed except that other than enteric bacteria were employed. Three supporting media , andQ3 were prepared in the quite sae manner as in the case of Example 1 and inoculated, respectively, with bacteria of the types , k and 1 enemerated hereinbefore.Impedance changes were measured and recorded in the same manner. The results as obtained are graphically illustrated in Figs. 5 A to 5 C . iFore specifically, the graph shown in Fig. 5 A represents the experimental results obtained for Staphylococcus aureus bacterium , the graph of fig. 5 B is for Streptococcus faecalis bacterium k , and the graph of Fig. 5 C is for Pseudor,onas aeruginosu bacterium 1 .Further, curves 1, 2 and 3 represent impedance change characteristics of the media , and , respectively. It will be seen that, for the medium 3 , Staphylococcus aureus andStreptococcus faecalis bring about significant impedance changes. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa having no function of fermenting glucose for utilization thereof brings about no impedance change for any one of the media , and . It will further be noted that, in the case of Staphylococcus aureus, the transition point from the decrease to the increase in impedance corresponds to a time lapse of about 2 hours, while the transition Foint in the case of Streptococcus faecalis occurs after time lapse of about 8 hours.Example 3 In this Example, influences of the quantity of disodium hydrogen phosphate added to the basal medium i.e. the dissolved concentration of disodium hydrogen phosphate to the impedance change of the medium were demonstrated. Four kinds of bacteria, i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia,Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus were used in the presentExample. Cultivation and inoculation were effected in the same manner as in the case of Example 1. In tne first place, starting from the basal medium containing 10 gr l of glucose, six types of media of different concentrations of disodium hydrogen phosphate in concentration series of 0 gr l, 0.25 gr l, 0.5 gr l, 1.0 gr l, 2.5 gr l and 5.0 gr l were prepares lor each of lebsiella ozaenae and Staphylococcus aureus, while eight types of media including 10 gr l and 20 gr l of disodium hydrogen phosphate in addition to the above concentration series were prepared for each of scherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris.The media thus prepared were charged in respective specimen cells each by 2 rrl. On the conditions mentioned above, cultivation and impedance measurement were performed with the aid of the instrument Orga 6. The results are graphically illustrated in figs. 6 A to 6 D , whereinFig. 6 illustrates time impedance changes as a function of the culture period tor cultivation of Escherichia coli, Fig. 6 B snows corresponding graphs for Klebsiella pneumonia, Fig. 6 C is for Proteus vulgaris, and Fig. 6 D is for Staphylococcus aureus.In these figures curves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 corresponds, respectively, to different concentrations of disodium hydrogen phosphate descriked above. , rOre specifically, the curves 1 corresponds to OCr l of sodium hydrogen phosphate. Curve 2 corresponds to 0.25 gr l of disodium hydrogen phosphate. In a similar manner, the curves 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 corres Fond, respectively, to 0.5 gr l, 1 gr l, 2.5 gr l, 5 gr l, 10 gr l and 20 gWl of disodium hydrogen phosphate. It will be noted that when the basal medium is added with only glucose, utilization thereof by bacteria does not bring about acid appreciable change in impedance, which makes however significant apprearance in the case where disodium hydrogen phosphate is added.Further, as the concentration of disodium hydrogen phosphate is increased, impedance tends to increase t a greater rate up to the concentration of disodium hydrogen phosphate of 5 gr l. Such tendency can be observed in cultures of all four tSes of bacteria. Further, it will be noted that influence of increase in the quantity of disodium hydrogen phosphate as added to the impedance change becomes insignificant when the concent ration in concern is increased beyond 20 gr l.Thus, it is considered that the effective concentration of disodium hydrogen phosphate is in a range front 1.0 gr l to 10 gr l. More preferably, the concentration range from 2.5 5r l to 5 gr l res rrore discriminative the difference in the impedance changes brought about by different types of bacteria. In the case of examples illustrated in Fig. 6 D , the curves 3, 4, 5 and 6 are flat, because rate of impedance change is positive.Example 4 In this example, it is investigated how the quantity of sodium chloride added to the basal medium exerts influence to the impedance change of the medium. To this end, four tes of bacteria, that is, Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus were used. The cultivation and inoculation were processed in the same manner as in the case of Example 1. Further, six dissolved concentrations were employed which were same as the first to the six concentrations in the series described above in conjunction with Example 3. Figs. 7 A to 7 D graphically illustrates the results of measured rents as obtained with the aid of the apparatus Orà 6. liore specifically, Fig. 7 A illustrates impedance changes brought about in the media by Echerichia coli. By the same token, Fig. 7 B is for Klebsiella pneumonia, Fig. 7 C is for Proteus vulgaris and rig. 7 D is for Staphylococcus aureus. Further, curves 1 to 6 in each of these figures correspond to the different concentrations of sodium chloride as employed. It will be seen that also in the present Example, impedance tends to be increased, as concentration of dissolved sodium chloride becomes higher. Thus, utilizations of glucose by different types of bacteria can be clearly discriminated. It is considered that the lower lirrat of the concentration threshold of sodium chloride is of the order of 1.0 grill. The curves 4, 5 and 6 shown in Fig. 7 D are flat, because the rate of impedance change is positive. From the Examples 3 and 4, it will be understcod that addition of strong electrolyte components such as disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium chloride in a predetermined quantity range contributes to increase impedance of the medium. This iray be explained by the fact that organic acids produced through metabolic activity 01. bacteria re are we lt electrolytes and impedance is increased rather than decreased after lapse of a predetermined tie since initiation of the utilization or consumption of sugar by bacteria. Example 5 In this example, impedance change was observed when only electrolyte component was added to a medium with a view to determining whether or not identification of bacteria is possible in the medium which contains no carbohydrates. Escherichia coli was employed. Cultivation and inoculation were performed in the same manner as in the case of Example 1. Sodium chloride was used as an electrolyte with six different concentrations of dissolution in the same concentration series as in the case of Example 4. Fig. 8 shows the results of reasurements obtained by using the instrument Orga 6. Curves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 corresponds to the different concentrations of added sodium chloride of O gr l, 0.25 gr l, 0.5 grill, 1.0 grill, 2.5 gr l and 9.0 gr l, respectively, as in the case of Example 4. It will be seen that any peculiar impedance changes of interest occur for all the six different types of media. The impedance tends to simply decrease as a function of time. This phenomenon rray be explained by the fact that since no carbohydrates are contained, organic acid discharged through metabolic activity of the bacterium is of ale negligible order. The same hold true for the case where disodium hydrogen phosphate is added.Example 6 In the present example, the experiment is intended to determine influence of the concentration of dissolved carbohydrates exerted to impedance change of the medium Two toes of bacteria, i.e. Escherichia coli and Proteus vulparis were used. Cultivation and inoculation were carried out in the same manner as in the case of the Example 1. A reference or control medium ass preFared by adding 5 gr l of disodium hydrogen phosphate to the basal medium containing 10 Ör l of peptone.Further, specimen or sample media were prepared by adding to the reference or control medium glucose in 1 gr l, 2.5 gr l, 5 gr l, 10 gr 1 and 20 gr l, respectively. The results of measurements rrade for the two types of bacteria mentioned above by using these media in the apparatus Orga 6 are graphica lly illustrated in Figs. 9 A and 9 B . The impedance changes brought about by Escherichia coli are represented by curves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 for the six different concentrations of . glucose mentioned above inFig. 9 A , while Fig. 9 B illustrates impedance changes of the different media upon which Proteus vulgaris was grown. As can be seen from the graphic illustrations, when no glucose is added or glen only a stall quantity of glucose is added, no si nificant change in the sense of increase in impedance makes appearance.However, when the quantity of added glucose exceeds 2.5 gr 1, there occur distinctly peculiar changes in impedance. It will thus be understood that 2.5 gr l or more of carbohydrates could be added in order to produce peculiar irrFedance change of interest in the medium. The same hold true for other carbohydrates such as mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, arabinose and the like.Example 7 Impedance changes brought about by consumption of various carbo hydrates by enteric bacteria were experimentally determined to ascertain that degree of utilization or consumption becomes different in dependence on the types or kinds of carbohydrates contained in the media, whereby impedance changes characteristic of different bacteria are also rendered different. Carbohydrates as employed includes glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose, and arabinose. Nine types of bacteria were used. They are Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens,Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobater cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Hafnia alveri and Citrobacter freundi. Eight types of sample cells each of 2 ml were prepared each by adding to the basal media with one of carbohydrates mentioned above together with 5 gr l of disodium hydrogen phosphate. Liquid inocula each of 10 1 to be inoculated in the samples were prepared by the sa ,e procedures as in the case of the Example 1. Figs. 10 A to 10 I graphically illustrate results of the measure rents mace by using the apparatus Orga 6. Fig. 10 A represents the measurement results for Escherichia coli,Fig. 10 B is for Serratia marcescens, Fig. 10 C is for Klebsiella pneumonia, Fig. 10 D is forKlebsiella ozaenae, Fig. lO E is Proteus vulgaris, Fig. 10 F is forEnterobacter cloacae, Fig. 10 G is for Proteus mirabilis, Fig. 10 H is for Hafnia alvei, and Fig. 10 I is for Citrobacter freundi. Further, impedance characteristic curves 1, 2, 3, A, 5, 6, 7 and 8 correspond to the uses of glucose, mannitol, incsitol, solbitol, rhamnose, sucrose, melibiose and arabinoe, respectiyely. It has been ascertained from this experiment that degree of utilization of carbohydrate bv the various bacteria in formation of acids differs in dependence on the tyres of carbohydrates as used. specifically, in the case where the impedance value continues to decrease, carbohydrate is not utilized. When impedance increases on the way, this rreans that carbohydrate is utilized. Further, differences in utilization of carbohydrate can be distinctly discriminated on the basis of profiles of the impedance characteristic curves. Thus, the results of measurement can be rade use of as the criterion for identif ying bacteria. In other words, it is decided that bacterium is negative for carbohydrate for which the impedance value of the associated medium continues to decrease.On the other hand, bacteria are decided to be posite for carbohydrate for which the impedance value of the associated media turn to increase on the way. Such decision is made for each of the eight types of car hydrates and utilized for identifying bacteria through comparison with the known data. In Table 1 recited below, utilizations of carbohydrates by various bacteria are listed.In this table, plus sign reans that bacteria are positive, while minus sign means that bacteria are negative. Then the results of the present Example were compared tit, those obtained through the same procedure by using a commertially available bacterium identifying kit API 20E manufactured by API company , it was confirmed that both results essentially coincide with each other.

Aminoacids employed in this example includes alginine, lysine and ornithine. Iline types of bacteria were used. They are Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens. Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella ozaenae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Hafnia alvei and Citrobacter freundi.The media were prepared by adding 5 gr l of grape sugar and 2.5 gr 1 of disodium hydrogen phosphate to 10 gr l of the basal medium and further added with each of aninoacids described above in 10 gr l. Thus, there were used three types of sample cells each of 2 ml for each of the nine types of bacteria enumerated above The liquid inocula each of 10 1 to be grown cn these cells were obtained through the same procedures as in the case of Example 1. The results of impedance measurements made by using the instrument Orga 6 are graphically illustrated in Figs. ll A to Fig. 11 I . More specifically, Fig. 11 A graphically illustrates the measurement results for Escherichia coli, Fig. 11 B is for Serratia marcescens, Fig. ll C is for Klebsiella pneumonia, Fig. 11 D is for Klebsiella ozaenae,Fig, 11 E is for Proteus vulgaris, Fig. 11 F is for Enterobacter cloacae,Fig, 11 G is for Proteus mirabilis, Fig. 11 B is for Hafhia alvei, andFig. 11 I is for Citrobacter freundi. In these figures, curves 1, 2 and 3 represent the impedance characteristic curves obtained for the uses of alginine, lysine and ornithine, respectively. A curve 4 corresponds to the case were no aminoacids are added. It will be noted from these graphic illustrations that degree of utilization aminoacids by each types of bacteria differs in dependence on the types of aminoacid. are particularly, the continuous decrease in impedance as observed from the associated impedance characteristic curve means that aminoacid is utilized by bacterium. On the other hand, when impedance turns to the increasing direction on the way, this means that aminoacids are not utilized by bacteria in concern.For example, in the case of Escherichia coli, ornithine and lysine are utilized or consumed,as can be seen from Fig. 11 A , while alginine is not utilized as will be seen from the profile of the associated curve which is similar to the one obtained in the case where no aminoacid is added.It is clear that the impedametrical method according to the invention allows decarboxylation reaction to be evaluated within six hours, .nich is very advantageous over the hitherto known agar plate method which requires an overnight cultivation. Such evaluation may be trade by determining whether bacteria in concern are positive or negative for these three types of arninoacids and comparing with knon data to thereby identify bacteria. In Table 2 recited below, utilizations of aminoacids by bacteria are represented by plus sign positive and minus si negative .

In this y, decarboxylation process can be detected as significant impedance changes .hen media which are prepared by adding glucose 5 gr 1 , aminoacids each 10 gr 1 and additionally disodium hydrogen phosphate 2.5 gr 1 are used. Next, method of identifying bacteria on the basis of the results as obtained will be described in concrete. According to a first identification method, peculiar impedance changes brought about by bacteria in particular media are made use of.To this end, a curve representing impedance change by unknown bacterium is depicted in a manner illustrated in Fig. 12 and compared with the corresponding curves of known bacteria to thereby identify the unknown bacterium. Parameters of an impedance characteristic curve involved in the comparative identification include rate alpha of impedance decrease for a unit time, rate 2 of impedance increase for a unit time, a period t1 during which impedance decreases, a period t2 during which impedance increases and rate I of impedance decrease immediately before impedance begins to increase, and, if required, a time span to lying between the start of culture and the beginning of the impedance decrease.In principle, data obtained through actual measurement of various bacteria in the Example 1 are summarized in a table such as Table 3 incorporated hereinafter to be used as the known or reference data. Unknown bacteria are monitored under the same conditions and the resultant data are com pared oith the reference data to check whether the data obtained for the unknown bacteria coincide with the reference data within a permissible tolerance range. If the coincidance is found, it is estimated that the unknown bacteria fez are same types as those of reference.

According to a third identifying method, the results obtained in the rumple ô are used. Decarboxylations of various aminoacids by bacteria are detected in terns of impedance changes, whereby identification of bacteria is made by determining whether bacteria are positive or negative to aminoacids. When the first, second and the third identifying methods are combined for making more comprehensive decision, identification of bacteria can be made with a much improved reliability and accuracy. For practical applications, an electronic computer or data pro cessing apparatus rray be advantageously employed for carrying out the bacteria identifying methods described above in accordance with appro priately prepared programs in automated runner with a high accuracy without requiring a lot of time. It should be mentioned here that in the figures described here in before in conjunction with the Examples 1 to 8, the origin at which tile impedance measurement is started is set slightly different among the individual samples. As will be appreciated from the foregoing description, the inven tion has now provided methods and media which allow identification of bacteria to be made by measuring impedance change including decrease and increase in impedance which are brought about as bacteria achieve the gr growth. The method according to the invention can be applied to carbohydrate utilization test as well as decarboxylation test in which difficulty has heretofore been encountered in identifyir micro organisms by the conventional impedametrical method. Since the invention can be applied to identification of micro organisms which are capable of utilizing carbohydrates, most of bacteria which are of interest in clinical areas can be identified by adopting the inventive method. Further, automated identification process can be realized on the basis of peculiar impedance change with a hither speed and higher accuracy as compared with the hitharto known identification which relies on change in color of indicators. Further, identification of bacteria on the basis of change in color requires a lot of time because growth of bacteria takes a a relatively long period. In contrast thereto, the impedance change which is of interest to the present invention occurs within a relatively short time. Thus, the tire required for establishing identity of bacteria can be significantly reduced.
