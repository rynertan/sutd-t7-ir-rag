# Coordinate input device with display.

## Abstract
A coordinate input device with display comprises a tablet 100 having a plurality of X direction magnetostrictive trans mission mediums arranged in parallel, a plurality of Y direction magnetostrictive transmission mediums arranged in parallel and superposed on the X direction transmission mediums substantially orthogonally thereto, and first and second coils arranged over substantial regions of the magnetostrictive transmission mediums. The device further comprises a plura lity of biasing magnetic bodies adapted apply a biasing magne tic field to the portions of the magnetostrictive transmission mediums surrounded by the first and second coils, and a tabu lar display 300 superposed on the tablet 100 and having a display area substantially equal to the position detection area on the tablet 100 . A position appointing magnetism generator 200 such as a magnetic pen is capable of producing a mag netism just enough for causing a local increase of electro mechanical coupling coefficient in the magnetostrictive trans mission mediums in the tablet 100 . The device further compri ses a position detecting circuit 400 adapted to supply a pulse current to one of the first and second coils such as to generate magnetostrictive vibration wave in a reference position on each magnetostrictive transmission medium or a position ap pointed by the position appointing magnetism generator 200. The position detecting circuit 400 being further adapted to measure the time duration between the moment at which the magnetostrictive vibration wave is generated and a moment at
