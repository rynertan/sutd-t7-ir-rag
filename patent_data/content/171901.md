# Anti skid hydraulic braking systems for vehicles.

## Abstract
In an anti skid braking system of the de boost and pump to re apply type, a solenoid operated cut off valve 5 is disposed between an expander piston 17 and a brake 2 , and the cut off valve 5 is operable independently of and separately from the expander piston 17 . The cut off valve 5 co operates with a one way valve 7 disposed between a master cylinder 1 and the brake 2 to hold the one way valve 7 in an open position when the cut off valve is in a closed position with the solenoid de energised. This ensures that the one way valve 7 can close only as a result of movement of the cut off valve 5 into an open position which can occur only when the solenoid is energised in response to a skid signal.
