# Differential permeability field concentrating magnetic read write head.

## Abstract
A magnetic image read write head including inner and outer, substantially co planar, symmetrically arranged pole portions. In one embodiment, the head is disclosed with the inner pole portion presenting a substantially full circular facial expanse, and with the outer pole portion presenting an annular facial expanse surrounding that of the inner pole portion. In another embodiment, each of the two pole portions presents a substantially annular facial expanse with the inner pole being hollow. In both embodiments, the inner pole portion has a magnetic permeability which is signifi cantly lower than that of the outer pole portion. An image unit written on a magnetic image storage medium by the head takes the form, generally, of a dot characterized by an appreciably larger magnetic field intensity adjacent its perimeter than inside the perimeter.
