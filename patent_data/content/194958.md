# ELECTRET TRANSDUCER AND METHOD OF FABRICATION

## Abstract
An electret transducer is comprised of a motor and signal processing apparatus, that may include an amplifier and or impedance matching means, disposed within a sealed conductive housing. The motor is fabricated in place within a housing and the signal processing means is mounted on the underside of the cover for the housing so that each may be independently tested prior to combining into a unitary structure. The motor is comprised of easily fabricated and assembled components that include means for spacing a backplate from the walls of the conductive housing and a spacer intermediate the backplate and the center of a diaphragm. The backplate and the diaphragm are provided with registering apertures. The amplifier is mounted to the cover to conductively connect to the housing and to provide rigid outwardly extending terminals for ready connection to further electrical circuits, as in a hearing aid. The component parts of the transducer are fabricated by half etching through the use of etching resist patterns that are placed in registering cooperative disposition on the surfaces of a flat sheet of material of which the components are comprised, to provide variations in thickness of predeter mined portions of the finished components.
