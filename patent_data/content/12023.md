## Description
D E S C R I P T I O NCHANGE SPEED GEAR is invention relates to change speed gear primarily for ote vehicle transmission and more particularly of the i in which layshaft gearing in constant mesh with input 1 output shaft gearing includes layshaft gears arranged 4 b be selectively clutched to respective layshafts in effecting a required drive transmission ratio.The object of this invention is to provide an improved arrangement of change speed gear whereby a retarding action can be obtained, e.g. to brake, or assist the braking of, a vehicle provided with the change speed gear. This and other practical advantages will be apparent from the following disclosure.According to this invention change speed gear is provided wherein ratios of the gear in one direction are transmitted by gear members on respective layshafts from input to output shafts of the change speed gear, a gear member of each layshaft being arranged to be selectively fully clutched by respective cluttthereto for transmitting a drive at the corresponding ratio and is characterised by the arrangement whereby when such a gear member is fully clutched to its layshaft for transmitting a high ratio drive at least one other such low ratio gear member e.g. for 1st or 2nd gear is arranged to be partially clutched as and when required to its layshaft in order to obtain retardation of the high ratio drive transmission.In the practical application of the invention to a vehicle transmission gearbox, the construction and arrangement is as follows, reference being had to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a generally axial plane section of the gearbox FIGURE 2 is an end view in the direction of the arrow II of flGUR 1, 3 to 6 are gear train diegraes of each forward speed ratio, and FIGURES 7 to 9 are diagrassatio vievs of retardation control means. Like parts are referred to by the same or similar reference designation throughout the dravings.Referring to FIGURES 1 and 2 a straight through gearbox providing four forward speed ratios is shown in which each such ratio is effected through lay gearing on a correspond ing layshaft so that there i8 a layshaft 1, 2, 3 and 4 for each ratio. in b the ase of the first gear layshaft 1 shown in the upper part of FIGURE 1, and in FIGURE 3, a lay gear 11 fast therewith constantly meshes with a corresponding gear 50 on the input shaft 5 whilst a further lay gear 12 on the lay Shaft I is arrantd to be clutched to the latter by means of clutch 10 at one end of the layshaft 1, which clutch 10 is shown of the multi disc type arranged for fluid pressure raulic or pneumatic operation. On the gear 12 teing clutched to the layshaft 1 a first or low gear ratio is transmitted to a corresponding gear 60 of a cluster 600 of such gears on the output shaft 6. The disc pack 13 of the clutch 10 is acted upon by a piston 15 for effecting a drive between the hub 14 of the clutch fast with the layshaft 1 and a spider 16 fast with the lay gear 12.As will be evident from FIGURE 2, the layshafts 1 2, 3 and 4 for the corresponding ratios are disposed about the I. input and output shafts 5 and 6 in a symmetrical and axially parallel manner with each clutch 10, 20, 30, 40 on its associated layshaft 1 2, 3, 4 being disposed at the same end of the gearbox 7. Thus by removal of end covers 71, 72, 73, or 74 of the gearbox casing 70, access is immediately afforded to all four clutcher 10 20, 30, 40 for servicing andfor replacement purposes in a simple and convenient manner, i.e. as set forth in the specification of our co pending patent application No.The four forward speed gear ratio trains provided by the gearbox by operation of the corresponding layshaft clutches 10 20, 30, 40 are indicated in FIGURES 3 to 6 where in each case a smooth engagement and disengagement can be effected by selective fluid pressure operation of the appropriate clutch.The provision of reverse gear is not shown but can be effected in any known or suitable manner, e.g. by dog clutch opration of a constant mesh train.In accordance with this invention and when it is desired to affect retardation of a particular high ratio drive transmission via a fully clutched lay gear 12 and corresponding layshaft 5 or 4, the clutch 10 or 20 of at least one low ratio lay gear 12 and layshaft I or 2 is arranged to be partially engaged and thus operates as a brake in retarding the drive transmission effected. This provides braking of the vehicle, e.g. when stopping or running downhill usually by assisting the normal braking of the vehicle for these purposes. In order to provide a more effective and distributed retarding action, the clutches 10 and 20 of both low ratio gears of the layshafts 1 and 2 are partially engaged so that retardation is more fully and smoothly effected through the gear system on the drive transmitted.Such retarding action has particular application to the fourth or top gear ratio as well as to the third gear ratio FIGURE 2 in which case the clutch 0 for the first gear ratio and that 20 for the second gear are both partially engaged to obtain the retarding action. Control of hydraulic or other fluid under pressure to the clutch pistons 15 is 9 effected through suitable selector vaives tor obtain required operation of the appropriate lutcocs viz low pressure partial operation of the clutches 10 an or 20 with full pressure drive transmission operation of the clutch 30 or 40.Retardation of firat and second gear ratio drives is not normally necessary due to the ratios transmitted and slow speed oporation of the vehicle in these gears tow pressure partial operation of the clutches 10 for 20 be effected or controlled in various ways.Thus as indicated in FIGURE 7 initial application movement of the vehicle brake pedal 160 actuates a valve 151 for supplying fluid e.g. air under low pressure to act on the pistons 15 of the clutches 10 and or 20 in order to obtain the retarding action which thus automatically assists the braking of the vehicle.Generally by way of an alternative mode of obtaining the retardation to that indicated in FIGURE 7, the arrangement of FIGURE a can be followed in which release of accelerator or similar control of the vehicle engine or motor, e.g. complete release of the accelerator pedal 170 conditions a valve 152 for causing low pressure operation of the clutches 10 and or 20. In the exampleshown final release movement of the accoleraor pedal 170 is arranged to operate a ticro switch 171 controlling electric e.g. solenoid operation of the valve 152 in automatically obtaining retardation in dependently of any vehicle brske application, i.e. with or without eparate brake application. In FIGURE 9 provision for hand controlled operation of a valve 153 for causing low preszure operation of the clutches 10 and or 20 at will is indicated, which hand control can be the sole means of effecting the retardation or can be provided for secondary use in relation to either of the automatic means shown in FIGURES 7 and 8, t.c. either with such moans or in dependently thereof. Particularly in the case of the brake associated operation of FIGURE 7 the operation of the valve 153 by the hand lever laO can be employed to effect retardation without brake application such as hen the vehicle is desoending a gentle gradient. The hand control means may also provide a aecond or over ride control of the retardation, e.g. in the event of failure of the automatic control means of FIGURE 7 or 8 or to augment either of them.The degree of retardation obtained may be variable according to the extent of operation of any of the valves 151, 152 or 1539 especially the hand controlled valve 153 for obtaining corres ponging low pressure operation of the clutches 10 and or 20. The provision for retardation according to this invention and a3 here described is also applicable to gearboxes or generally the sane arrangement but having side input shaft drives as further described in the specification of our co pending patent application No. Wereas the provision for retardation is particularly applicable to change speed gear of the kind described, i.e. in which the clutches are situated at the same ends of corresponding layshafts for access purposes, the arrangement for retardation according to this invention is also applicable to change speed gear in which the clutches are otherwise positioned on the layshafts.The invention has particular practical application to the gearboxes of motor driven l and vehicles of various kinds such as road or rail vehicles and especially of omnibuses or similar public service road vehicles. Rowever it is generally applicable to motor driven change speed gear for various purposes where retardation of mechanism driven thereby is required.
