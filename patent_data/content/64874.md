# Electrolytic cell operation.

## Abstract
A shutdown procedure for use with electrolytic cells having gas electrodes, e.g., oxygen air cathodes, comprises imposing a nitrogen purge on the cells in place of the normal gas supply to the electrodes and maintaining the resultant nitrogen atmosphere during the shutdown period. This procedure, which allows low voltage operation achieved before shutdown to be continued after resumption of the power supply, is suitable for instance with an electrolytic cell 12 having a separator 16 between an anode compartment 20 with an anode 14 and a cathode compartment 22 with a gas cathode 18 associated with an oxygen or air compartment 24 if it is necessary to stop operation of the cell 12 , the oxygen or air supplied to the compartment 24 is replaced by nitrogen gas until normal operation can be resumed.
