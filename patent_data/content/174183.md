# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ELECTROCONDUCTIVE FIBROUS ARTICLES

## Abstract
An electroconductive fibrous article 1 is prepared by soaking a water absorptive fibrous article in a palladium hydrosol containing a cationic surfactant, an anionic surfac tant, a non ionic surfactant or a mixture thereof and, after washing with water and or drying, subjecting the article to chemical plating so as to deposit a metal on the fibers 3 on to which colloidal palladium has been absorbed.
