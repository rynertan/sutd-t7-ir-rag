# Tension hanger embodying fire resistant sealing means.

## Abstract
A tubular member 42, 62 of the type commonly utilized in wellhead equipment 10 having embodied therein sealing means 72, 64 operative when cooperatively associated with a mating member 16, 14 to effectuate the establishment of a fire resistant seal between the tubular member 42, 62 and the mating member 16, 14 . The subject tubular member 42, 62 preferably terminates at one end thereof in an extended neck portion 82, 80 with the sealing means 72, 64 being provided on the outside circumferential surface of the extended neck portion 82, 80 adjacent the free end of the latter. The mating member 16, 14 includes an inside circumferential surface suitable dimensioned such that the tubular member 42, 62 , when inserted therewithin, can be made to occupy a fixed longitudinal position relative thereto. The sealing means 72, 64 includes an annular band 74, 66 embodying preselected height and width dimensions, the ratio of which falls within a predetermined range such that when the tubular member 42, 62 and the mating member 16, 14 occupy the aforesaid fixed longitudinal position thereof the engagement of the annular band 74, 66 of the tubular member 42, 62 with the inner circumferential surface of the mating member 16, 14 establishes an elastic but fire resistant seal therebetween characterized by the fact that plastic deformation is avoided yet the required unit loading is furnished thereby.
