# Coreless pressure sensitive label supply roll.

## Abstract
A coreless supply roll of pressure sensitive labels includes an elongated paper carrier web which has a release coating on one side and is dye cut to provide lon gitudinally spaced feed holes adapted to receive a tooth feed wheel of a label printing and applicating device. The coated side of the carrier web supports a label web which is releasably attached to the carrier web by pressure sen sitive adhesive and is dye cut to define distinct labels adapted to be successively printed and peeled from the carrier web within the device. The carrier web has an inner wrap or convolution which defines a center opening for the roll, and the inner convolution has a first end section which is folded back over a radially underlying second end section. A spot of permanent adhesive bonds the uncoated side of the first end section of the carrier web to a radially overlying portion of the uncoated side of the carrier web to provide the composite web with a positively connected end loop.
