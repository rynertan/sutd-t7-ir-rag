## Description
MAGNETIC RECORDING REPRODUCING APPARATUSFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus for recording and or reproducing an audio signal by frequency modulation, or more in particular to such an apparatus wherein the decrease in the level of the frequency components of an FM audio signal that occurs during reproduction is compensated for during recording. Recently, a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus called a Hi Fi video tape recorder capable of high fidelity reproduction of an audio signal in which the audio signal is recorded by the rotary head together with the video signal is closely watched. The magnetic recording reproducing apparatus of this type comprises a rotary head exclusively used for recording and reproducing the video signal and a rotary head exclusive to recording and reproduction of the audio signal, so that recording tracks for the video signal and the audio signal are formed to each other diagonally of the magnetic tape in the longitudinal direction thereof, the audio signal and the video signal being recorded in a deep magnetic layer and a shallow magnetic layer of the magnetic tape respectively. A method of recording audio and video signals in a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus called a Hi Fi video tape recorder is illustrated in Fig. 1. The diagram of Fig. 1 includes sectional views of a video magnetic tape 1 along the running direction and along the thickness thereof. Along the tape thickness, a magnetic layer 3 is coated on a substrate 2 and is magnetized by a video headHV or an audio head HA. The tape 1 includes a control track 4, a video FM audio track 5 and a normal audio track 6 used also for stereo. This tape format is the same as a video tape thus far used except that a video track is also used for an FM audio track. The video head HV and the audio head HA are arranged in a manner to pass the same point as shown in Fig.1, and the audio head HA starts the recording before the video head HV. An audio signal SA which is FM modulated is recorded through the audio head HA deeply in the magnetic layer 3 of the magnetic tape 1, and therefore this recording is called the deep layer recording . Next, with a predetermined time delay, the video head HV begins recording. A combined video signal including an FM modulated luminance signal superimposed with a color signal is recorded through the video head HV on the FM audio signal recorded immediately before. At this time, the video signal SV recorded by the video head HV is recorded only in the surface of the magnetic layer 3, and the FM audio signal recorded in the deep layer, though erased partially in the surface thereof, remains recorded in the deep layer, thereby making it possible to take out the video signal SV and the audio signal SA independently of each other. Further, as shown in Fig. 1, the video head HV and the audio head HA have different azimuths 6A and EV to reduce interferences with each other. Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing an example of this conventional magnetic recording reproducing apparatus.In Fig. 2, reference numeral 11 designates an input terminal, numeral 12 an input processing section, numeral 13 an FM modulator, numeral 14 a band pass filter, numeral 15 a recording amplifier section, numeral 16, 17 switches, numeral 18, 19 rotary heads, numeral 20 a reproduction amplifier section, numeral 21 a band pass filter, numeral 22 an FM demodulator section, numeral 23 an output processing section, and numeral 24 an output terminal. In this diagram, the audio signal applied from the input terminal 11, after being subjected to such a process as pre emphasis at the input processing section 12, is supplied to and FM modulated at the FM modulator section 13.The FM modulator section 13 has an input output modulation characteristic shown in Fig. 3 and produces an FM audio signal, that is, a signal b of a frequency changing with the amplitude of an input audio signal a. The frequency spectrum of this FM audio signal, as shown in Fig. 4, has a side band wave on both sides of the central carrier frequency fct and various frequency components between the lower limit frequency fL and upper limit frequency fH of the sideband waves. The FM audio signal b is made up of the sum of Fourier series of these frequency components. The unrequired components of this FM audio signal b are removed at the bandpass filter 14, and the resultant signal is amplified at the recording amplifier section 15 and applied to the switch 17 through the switch 16 which is closed on a contact A. A configuration of a rotary cylinder as viewed from above is shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 2, the rotary heads 186 19 are mounted on a rotary cylinder 25 carrying a rotary heads exclusive to recording and reproduction of video signal, are adapted to rotate with a period 1 30 second equal to one frame period of the video signal, and scan the magnetic tape 1 alternately for each half revolution 1 60 second of the rotary cylinder 25. In Fig. 5, the magnetic tape 1 is wound by slightly more than 180 degree on the rotary cylinder 25, and is fed at constant rate by a pinch roller 26 and a capstan 27. The rotary cylinder 25 carries the audio headsHA 18, 19 and the video heads HV, and rotates at the rate of 1800 r.p.m. to scan from point A to point B at intervals of 1 60 second. Both the video heads HV and the audio headsHA are arranged in a pair disposed 180 degree opposite to each other, so that one reaches point B and is separated from the magnetic tape at the same time that the other reaches point A, thus alternately keeping in contact with the magnetic tape 1 for recording or reproduction. In Fig. 2, the switch 17 is operated synchronously with the rotation of the rotary cylinder 25, and is adapted to be sequentially switched to close on the side of the rotary head 18 or 19 scanning the magnetic tape 1. As a result, the FM audio signal is recorded on the magnetic tape 1 alternately by the rotary heads 18 and 19. Since the magnetic tape 1 is wound on the rotary cylinder 25 only by 180 degree as shown in Fig. 5, the recording operation would be disconnected every half rotation if only one head is provided. Accordingly, a pair of heads arranged 180 degree opposite to each other eliminate this inconvenience by keeping one of the heads scanning the magnetic tape. Although the recording signal flows in both of the rotary heads 18 and 19, the actual recording is effected from the rotary head scanning the magnetic tape 1 onto the magnetic tape 1. In other words, a pair of rotary heads 18 and 19 scan the magnetic tape 1 to record alternately at intervals of 1 60 second. In reproduction mode, the switch 16 in Fig. 2 is closed on the contact B, and the switch 17 operates in the same manner as in recording mode. Then, the FM audio signal recorded in the magnetic tape 1 is reproduced by the rotary heads 18 and 19 alternately and is amplified at the reproduction amplifier section 20 through the switch 16. The FM audio signal thus amplified is applied to the bandpass filter 21 where the unrequired components thereof are eliminated, and the resulting FM audio signal is applied to the FM demodulator section 22 for demodulation. Further, the signal from the section 22 is subjected to such process as de emphasis at the output processing section 23, with the result that the original audio signal is produced at the output terminal 24. In this magnetic recording reproducing apparatus, as described above with reference to Fig. 1, the video signal is recorded in the shallow part of the magnetic layer 3 of the magnetic tape 1, the FM audio signal in the deep part thereof, so that the recording track for the video signal and the one for the FM audio signal are formed one on the other on the magnetic tape 1. As a result, in reproducing the video signal by the rotary head exclusive to the recording and reproduction of the video signal, theFM audio reproduction signal recorded in the deep part of the magnetic layer 3 is reproduced to some degree at the same time on the one hand, while the video signal is simultaneously reproduced at the time of reproduction of theFM audio signal by the rotary heads, 18, 19 on the other hand.In order to remove the unnecessary FM audio signal or video signal from the reproduction signal produced by the rotary heads, therefore, the frequency bands of the video signal and the FM audio signal are normally differentiated. Fig. 6 is a diagram for explaining the relationship between the frequency bands of the video signal and the FM audio signal, in which the dashed line represents the video signal and the solid line the FM audio signal.In Fig. 6, the video signal to be recorded and reproduced contains an FM modulated luminance signal Y and a carrier chrominance signal converted to low band, and the frequency band of this luminance signal Y is set on high frequency side of the carrier chrominance signal C. The frequency band of the FM audio signal b, on the other hand, is set in the margin between the frequency bands of the luminance signal Y and the carrier chrominance signal C. In the magnetic recording reproducing apparatus for recording and reproducing a video signal in this manner, the frequency band of the luminance signal Y and that of the carrier chrominancp signal C are standardized, and therefore the frequency band of the FM audio signal b to be set is accordingly determined. As an example, the lower frequency of the luminance signal Y takes the value of about 1.3 MHz, and the upper frequency of the carrier chrominance signalC about 1.1 MHz, so that the frequency band of the FM audio signal b is required to be set between about 1.1 MHz and about 1.3 MHz. It is, however, difficult to set the frequency band of the FM audio signal b in such a narrow range, and especially, it is impossible to so set when the audio signal is a stereo signal.Generally, therefore, the frequency band of the FM audio signal b is allowed to partially double with that of the luminance signal Y and the carrier chrominance signal C In the case where the audio signal is a stereo signal, for instance, a central carrier frequency of the FM audio signal is set at 1.7 MHz somewhat higher than the lower frequency about 1.3 MHz of the luminance signal Y . In compensation, the level of theFM audio signal is reduced below that of the luminance signal Y and the carrier chrominance signal C in order for the FM audio signal b not to interfere with the luminance signal Y or the carrier chrominance signal C. If the FM audio signal b is to be recorded in the deep part of the magnetic layer 3 of the magnetic tape 1, on the other hand, the gap length g of the rotary head 18, 19 is required to be increased. The relative positions of the video head HV and the audio head HA are shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7, the video head HV and the audio headHA scan the magnetic tape 1 diagonally, while recording the recording signal of frequency f, so that the video signal is recorded at the depth dV of the magnetic tape 1 and the audio signal at the depth dA of the magnetic tape 1. LetX be the recording wavelength, and vH the relative speed of the rotary head against the magnetic tape 1, and the recording wavelength X is given asEMI8.1 Further, the relationship between the recording wavelength X and the gap length g of the recording rotary head is expressed asEMI8.2 According to the references so far disclosed, the recording depth is approximately 1 3 1 4 of the recording wavelengthA. If the recording wavelength is lengthened, therefore, the video signal is recorded deeper, by increasing the gap length g, the same effect is obtained equivalently. If the gap length g of the rotary heads 18, 19 is increased, however, the band recordable by the rotary heads 18, 19 and the tape 1 is narrowed. If it is desired to reproduce the FM audio signal at high level, the AM audio signal is required to be recorded as deep into the deep part of the magnetic layer 3 as possible. As a result, as shown in Fig. 8, the frequency band of the FM audio signal b is set near the upper limit of the recordable band of the head tape system shown by the dashed line. The FM audio signal b is thus affected by the characteristics near the upper limit of the recordable band by recording and reproduction, and the high frequency components are attenuated more in level as shown by the solid line as against the dashed line representing the recording level in Fig. 9. The result is that as shown inFig. 10, the reproduced FM wave of the audio signal has a large amplitude at the low frequency portion Q thereof and a small amplitude at the high frequency portion h thereof.This amplitude change deteriorates the signal to noise ratio of the audio signal demodulated. Specifically, the signalto noise ratio of the audio signal has a correlationship with the amplitude of the signal reproduced from the magnetic tape 1, or generally with C N carrier wave to noise ratio , and therefore the ratio C N is deteriorated at the portions of a small amplitude, thus deteriorating the signal to noise ratio. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The primary object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus in which the variation of the level of the FM audio signal with the frequency components is prevented thereby to reproduce an audio signal of a high S N by compensating, at the time of recording, for the reduction in the level of the frequency components of the FM audio signal caused during reproduction. Another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus in which the envelope of the reproduced FM audio signal can be flatenned without being affected by the characteristics of the head tape system, thereby reproducing the audio signal at satisfactory signal to noise ratio.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a diagram showing a method of recording a video signal and an audio signal in a magnetic recordingreproducing apparatus according to the prior art and the present invention.

Fig. 15 is a block diagram showing a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The block diagram of Fig. 11 shows a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus according to the present invention. In Fig. 11, reference numeral 28 designates a recording current equivalent section, in which parts corresponding to those in Fig. 2 are designated by the same numerals as those in Fig. 2. The configuration and operation of this embodiment is identical to those of the prior art shown in Fig. 2 except that in Fig. 11 the recording current equivalent section 28 is inserted next to the recording amplifier section 15, and therefore those parts already explained previously will not be described. In Fig. 11, the recording current of the FM audio signal amplified at the recording amplifier section 15 is applied through the recording current equivalent section 28 to a switch 16. The recording current equivalent section 28, as shown in Fig. 12, has such an equivalent characteristic that the amplitude of the recording signal is increased more with the increase in the frequency of the recording current hence the frequency of the FM audio signal . The equivalent characteristic herein is defined as such a characteristic that the recording current is increased with the frequency by use of a high pass filter. When the recording current thus made equivalent by the recording signal equivalent section 28 is recorded or reproduced at the rotary heads 18, 19, the level of the FM audio signal obtained from the band pass filter 21 is increased with the increase in the component frequency.Since the frequency band of the FM audio signal is set near to the upper limit of the recordable frequency band of the head tape system as explained above, on the other hand, the characteristic near to the upper limit of the recordable band, as shown by dashed line in Fig. 13, reduces the level of the reproduced FM audio signal with the increase in the component frequency. If the equivalent characteristic of the recording current equivalent section 28 Fig. 12 is properly set, the recording current equivalent section 28 functions to compensate for the level down of the reproduced FM audio signal for each of the frequency components thereof which occurs dependent on the characteristic of the head tape system, thereby flattening the frequency spectrum of the reproduced FM audio signal as shown by the solid line inFig. 13. As a result, the envelope of the FM wave is flattened thereby to improve the signal to noise ratio of the audio signal reproduced. The recording current equivalent section 28 may include a frequency dependent circuit such as a peaking circuit like a specific example shown in Fig. 14. In Fig. 14, a transistor Tr, resistors R1, R2,R3 and a capacitor C1 make up a buffer amplifier, while resistors R4, R5 and a capacitor C2 configure a high pass filter. With the increase in the frequency of the recording current of the FM audio signal supplied from the input terminal 29, the impedance of the capacitor C2 is reduced, and therefore, the amplitude of the recording current produced at the output terminal 30 increases with frequency. Another embodiment of the magnetic recordingreproducing apparatus according to the present invention is shown in the block diagram of Fig. 15. The recording current equivalent section 28 inserted between the recording amplifier section 15 and the switch 16 in Fig. 11 is disposed between the band pass filter 14 and the recording amplifier section 15 in this embodiment. This circuit has substantially the same performance as the first embodiment shown in Fig. 11. The present invention is not limited to what is called the Hi Fi video tape recorder described above. It will be understood from the foregoing descriptions that according to the present invention, there is provided a magnetic recording reproducing apparatus having superior performance, in which the envelope of the reproduced FM audio signal is flattened thereby to reproduce an audio signal of superior signal to noise ratio without being affected by the characteristics of the head tape system, thereby eliminating the disadvantages of the prior art apparatuses described above.
