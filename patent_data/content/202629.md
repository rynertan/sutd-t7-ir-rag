# OPTICAL DEVICES AND SYSTEMS COMPRISING AN OPTICAL WAVEGUIDE COUPLER

## Abstract
An optical device or communications system comprising a polarization selective optical coupler which comprises two polarization preserving birefringent optical waveguides which are side by side and such that propagation constants are mismatched by different amounts for two polarizations of interest. Such couplers are useful, e.g. in wavelength multi plexers, fiber Raman amplifiers, laser sparing connections, and for in line polarizers where the rejected polarization re mains available.
