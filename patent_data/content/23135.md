# Phenolic resin particles, process for their production and friction elements containing them.

## Abstract
Phenolic resin particles which are useful as friction particles for use in friction elements such as brake linings, clutch facings or other braking devices, are produced by dispersing a liquid, heat curable phenolic resin in a paraffinic oil having a viscosity of at least 216 centistokes at 37.7 C 1,000 SUS at 100 F. at a temperature of 100 to 175 C to cure the resin. Preferred friction particles are prepared from phenolic resins containing benzylic ether linkages by curing in the hot paraffinic oil or by other heating methods. Friction elements containing such particles and a friction binder are also described.
