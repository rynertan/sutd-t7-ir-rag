# METHOD OF SYNTHESIZING UREA.

## Abstract
This method of synthesizing urea comprises the steps of introducing into a first heater 3 the distillate of a reactor 2 containing urea, ammonium carbonate, excess ammonia and water, separating the excess ammonia and decomposing the ammonium carbonate to separate them from the liquid phase then introducing the distillate of the heater 3 into a second heater 6 separating the excess residual ammonia in the presence of stock carbon dioxide to be utilized as a stripping gas and decomposing the ammonium carbonate to separate them from the liquid phase, delivering the liquid distillate of the second heater 6 a urea solution refining step under low pressure and returning gaseous distillate separated in the first and second heaters to the reactor 2 .
