## Description
This invention relates to a faucet structure, particularly of the single lever type. As is known, various types of single lever faucet are currently available commercially which use one control member for controlling the water delivery flow rate and mixing of hot and cold water. Conventional single lever faucets usually include a body wherein an actuation cartridge may be introduced which may be of a variety of types, which body may be connected to a cold water delivery pipe and hot water delivery pipe, and is a single piece construction with a water outlet spout. That prior construction, as universally adopted, requires the availability of a plurality of moulds for each given set of faucets, so as to provide desired configurations to meet a variety of aesthetic requirements. Another disadvantage of prior faucets is that filtering elements must be inserted in the cold and hot water delivery pipes to prevent settling of sand or the like particles in between the ceramic discs comprising the sealing valve body. Such filtering elements, owing to their location in the delivery piping, are generally awkward to reach. Thus, they cannot be inspected and cleaned at frequent intervals, with the result that after a period of operation the strainers are bound to clog and significantly reduce the water flow rate, while jeopardizing the faucet correct operation. It is a primary object of this invention to obviate such prior disadvantages by providing a novel faucet structure, particularly of the single lever type, which is designed to include a relatively standard element remaining practically unchanged irrespective of the faucet type, with which cornpletion elements may be associated to impart the faucet with a desired configuration. A further object of the invention is to provide a faucet structure of the single lever type, which by comprising a component part which is left unvaried for all types and applications of faucets, affords an appreciable economy of manufacture while also affording a significant rationalization of the production process. This single lever faucet, moreover, owing to its peculiar contructional features, can give full assurance of being reliable and safe to use. Further, the same is highly versatile and can meet any contingent requirements. It is another object of this invention to provide a faucet structure of the single lever type, which can be readily manufactured from commercially available elements and materials, while being quite competitive from the economical standpoint. These and other objects, such as will be apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a faucet structure, particularly of the single lever type, according to the invention, which comprises a body housing into which an actuation cartridge may be inserted. Said body housing is in conmunication with cold water and hot water delivery pipes, and is characterised in that it is made ready for association with a delivery pipe. Further features and advantages of this invention will become apparent on considering the following description of a preferred, though not exclusive, embodiment of this single lever faucet structure, in conjunction with the accompanying illustrative drawings, where Figure 1 is a schematical side elevation view of one configuration of this faucet, shown partly in section Figure 2 is a top plan view of this faucet Figure 3 shows the body housing as viewed from above Figures 4,5 and 6 are a top plan view, side elevation view, and bottom view, respectively of a delivery cam for application to said body housing Figure 7 is a partly cut away view of an actuating lever Figure 8 is a side elevation view of the faucet actuation cartridge Figure 9 is an exploded view of the.actuation ceirtridge, along with the strainer holder plate and related strainers, which may be manufactured separate l or integrally with the strainer holder plate Figure 10 is En elevation view showing a body housing as made reE ly for a so called recessed faucet design Figure 11 is a plan view of the body housing shown in Figure 10. With particular reference to the numerals appearing in the drawing views, a single lever faucet structure according to the invention, as generally indicated at 1, uniquely comprises a body housing 2 having a substantially cylindrical overall shape and being formed at the bottom with a hole 3 in communication with a cold water delivery pipe, and with a hole 4 in communication with a hot water delivery pipe. Into said body housing 2, an actuation cartridge may be introduced which is generally designated with the reference numeral 5 and, as shown in Figure 9, includes conventional sliding ceramic discs 10 arranged to move across a bottom body 11 which defines inlet ports, the ceramic discs 10 being caused to translate by means of an oscillating pin 12 connected to an upper element 13 associable with a valve body 14, The cartridge 5 is held in position by a screw nut 13 associable with the body housing 2. That same nut 13 is formed with an outer groove 15 at the edge thereof, so as to permit engagement by a protective cap 20 which has preferably a cylindrical configuration.To actuate the cartridge 5, there is provided an actuating lever 21 attachable to the oscillating pin 12, as by means of a set screw 22. An important feature of the invention is that the body housing has a substantially cylindrical shape and is made ready for connection to a delivery pipe, indicated at 30, which is not an integral construction with the body housing itself. Thus, a single body housing may be provided, along with its respective cartridge, to fit a series of differently configured faucets. This is accomplished quite simply by modifying the delivery spouts, or whatever else may be found appropriate, seeing that the body housing is made ready for application of a desired delivery spout thereto. In order to secure the delivery spout to the body housing 2, a lateral through hole 31 is provided which can receive a threaded bushing 22 for insertion in a corresponding threaded seating formed in the delivery spout. Another important feature of the invention is that to protect the ceramic discs against sand, dust, and the like, strainers or filtering elements, indicated at 40, are provided which have a substantially frusto conical shape and may be mounted directly on the bottom side of the actuation cartridge 5. To mske the connection, it may be convenient to use an intermediate disc 41, which would be secured with a snap action effect to the valve body 14 by means of tabs 42. Optionally and where feasible, the strainers 40 may be connected to the cartridge bottom and accommodated in holes provided directly in the body housing. As shown in Figures 10 and 11, the same construction principles may be equally well applied to the instance of recess mounted bodies, indicated at 50, whereto, instead of a delivery spout, a simple delivery conduit is connected, as recessed in the wall, which conduit would be, in turn, communicated to the delivery spout proper. However, this would be no departure from the inventive principle, in that there still is a cylindrical body housing which is made ready for application of the delivery conduit. It may be appreciated from the foregoing description that the invention achieves its objects. In particular, it should be pointed out that of considerable import is the provision of a cylindrical body housing which enables the connection, by means of the bushing 31, of different delivery spouts thereto, without involving alteration of the whole faucet construction but rather using a standard body housing which comprises the body housing 2 and respective cartridge 5, while changed are the accessory elements which are applied thereafter. Further, the insertion of the strainers 40 directly into the body housing, at the location of the actuation cartridge 5, affords the possibility of an easy and quick inspection of the strainers for servicing them at frequent intervals. The invention as disclosed herein is susceptible to many modifications and variations without departing from the true scope of the instant inventive idea. All of the details illustrated, moreover, may be replaced by other, technically equivalent, elements,
