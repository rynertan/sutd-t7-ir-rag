# Method of producing cover fabrics for V belts and cover fabrics so produced.

## Abstract
A fabric is bias cut into a continuous strip of fabric. The individual fibers in the continuous strip 12 are im pregnated with an elastomeric polymeric material effective to increase the flex and wear life of the fabric when used as a cover fabric for V belts. This impregnation is accom plished by immetsing the strip 12 in a fluid mix 13 hav ing a viscosity of about 2000 cps or less, the mix including a fluid carrier, an elastomeric polymer e.g. a polychloro prene compound and a dark pigment. A coating 16 of an elastomeric polymer e.g. another polychloroprene com pound is applied to the strip, the strip is streched in its width direction to increase the angular relation of the threads of the fabric relative to its longitudinal axis, and the thus coated strip is dried 20 . The continuous strip is ultimately slit 24 longitudinally of itself into a plurality of tapes, and the tapes 26 are used to cover a V belt.
