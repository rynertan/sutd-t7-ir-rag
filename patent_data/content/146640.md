# PERIOD DETECTION CIRCUIT.

## Abstract
A period detection circuit judges that an object whose velocity is being monitored has stopped from the fact that the period of input pulses being measured suddenly changes to N times as large as the period of ordinary input pulses. The circuit is provided with a first memory means 7, 24 which holds a value corresponding to the period of pulses PI being measured, a second memory means 14,30 which holds a value obtained by multiplying by a predetermined number the value stored in the first memory means in a preceding measuring operation, and a comparator means 16,31 which compares the stored contents of the two memory means, and which provides as a comparison output a stop detection signal STP when the stored values SFo, M₁ in the first memory means are larger than the corres ponding stored values SHs, M₂ in the second memory means when SHo SFs, M₁ M₂ . Thus it is possible to reliably detect the stoppage of machinery whose velocity is being kept at a speed corresponding to the period of input pulses being measured.
