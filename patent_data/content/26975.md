# Process for the production of phenolic resins.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a process for producing phe nolic resins by reacting formaldehyde with a phenolic reac tant which contains an isomeric mixture of C₂ C₅ mono alkyl phenols and in which the meta monoalkyl phenol content is from 10 to 50 by weight. The isomeric mixture of mono alkyl phenols, which may contain in addition un modified phenol, is derived by alkylating phenol with an olefin and subsequently isomerising the crude alkylate to improve the meto isomer content thereof. Resins produced using the phenolic reactant as above can be used for producing laminates which have a good balance of physi cal properties associated normally with those required in industrial laminates

## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PHENOLIC RESINS The present invention relates to the production of phenolic resins by condensation of phenol and formaldehyde or a formaldehyde donor. It is well known to produce phenolic resins by condensation of phenolic materials with formaldehyde or substances capable of acting as formaldehyde donors, for example hexamethylene tetramine. Mixtures rich in meta cresol have been used for many years in the production of certain phenolic resins. However, supply of meta cresol has diminished in recent years as a result of the reduction in coal tar production which has taken place. Coal tar is the main source of cresol. It is highly desirable to find alternatives to meta cresol containing mixtures for the production of phenolic resins. It has been suggested in an article by Freeman, JH et al entitled, Cured Phenolic Resins Plasticized by Substituents on theAromatic Ring in Society of Plastics Engineers Journal, Vol 17 7 , July 1961 pp 673 677 that pure monoalkyl phenols or binary mixtures of pure monoalkyl phenols may be used as integral plasticizers in flexible laminated resins. However this method needs the use of pure materials as stated above. It has now been found that ternary mixtures of monoalkyl phenols containing all the three isomers, namely the ortho , meta and paraisomers, of the type produced by alkylation of phenol with an olefin followed by isomerisation, can be used directly to produce laminated resins of the desired physical characteristics. According to the present invention a process for producing a phenolic resin by reacting a phenolic reactant with formaldehyde or a formaldehyde donor is characterised in that the phenolic reactant comprises a mixture of the ortho , meta and parasubstituted isomers of mono alkyl phenol in which i the alkyl group has 2 to 5 carbon atoms, and ii the meta monoalkyl phenol content is from 10 to 50 by weight of the total phenolic reactant. The alkyl group in the mono alkyl phenol constituent of the phenolic material preferably contains 3 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable alkyl groups are n alkyl, secondary alkyl or tert alkyl.It is preferred to use alkyl phenol mixtures in which the alkyl group is isopropyl and or sec butyl. The isomeric mixture of mono alkyl phenols comprises in proportion by weight percent the ortho , meta and para isomers suitably in the range of 5 10 25 40 5 15 respectively. The remainder in this mixture may be made up from unmodified phenol. A particularly convenient source of the isomeric mixture of mono alkyl phenols used in the phenolic reactant is that derived by the alkylation of phenol followed by isomerisation of the crude alkylate thus formed directly without any intermediate purification or separation steps. The object of the isomerisation step is to increase the meta isomer content of the alkylate. The mixture thus produced contains between 30 and 35 by weight of unmodified phenol. One such method of producing a mixture of isomeric mono alkyl phenols enriched in the meta isomer is described in Research Disclosure No 19309 published in May 1980 No. 193 .Thus, a particularly suitable method of making such mixtures of isomeric mono alkyl phenols is to react phenol with an olefin in the presence of a Bronsted or Lewis acid alkylation catalyst at a temperature in the range 50 to 1600C for a time sufficient to give a molar conversion of alkyl phenol of 10 to 90 , the activity of the catalyst being such as to give a conversion in 10 hours, followed by isomerisation of the resulting alkylation product in the presence of a Bronsted or Lewis acid catalyst at a temperature greater than 1600C for at least one hour. Examples of alkylation catalysts which can be used in the first step are bleaching earths, e.g. montmorillonite, activated by treatment with a mineral acid, preferably sulphuric acid. The process described above inevitably produces a certain amount of the dialkylisomers in addition to the desired mixture of mono alkyl phenols. Surprisingly, this crude isomerised product containing the dialkyl isomers can be used directly, without any purification or separation of the intermediates or the final product, without any adverse effect on the resins produced in spite of the emphasis to the contrary in the Freeman et al article referred to above to exclude the dialkyl isomers. It may be possible to carry out the alkylation and isomerisation steps in such a manner as to give a product containing the desired amounts of phenol and meta monoalkyl phenol directly. Further amounts of unmodified phenol may be added to the isomeric mixture to produce a phenolic reactant capable of giving a resin with the desired properties. Conditions for producing phenolic resins are well known to those skilled in the art. It is preferred to use the conditions which have proved satisfactory for the production of phenolic resins from cresol.It is preferred to use molar ratios of the phenolic reactant to formaldehyde in the range 1 0.70 to 1 0.95 and to carry out the reaction under alkaline conditions. The process of the present invention may, however, be used for the production of novolak resins, in which an acid catalyst is used and a substantial excess of phenol is employed. The composition of a typical phenolic reactant used in producing laminating resins contains the following components, all by weight i mono alkyl phenols, ortho isomer 3 6 meta isomer 20 30 para isomer 6 9 ii dialkyl phenols 3 5 and iii unmodified phenol 50 60 The reaction between the aldehyde and the phenolic reactant is suitably carried out at elevated temperatures, for example 100 to 140 C. The process of the present invention is particularly suitable for making phenolic resins for use in making laminates. Phenolic laminates obtained by impregnating sheets of fibrous material, for example paper, glass fibre, with phenolic resins are a well known class of materials as are phenolic resins suitable for use in making them. The process of the present invention is particularly suitable for making phenolic resins suitable for use as laminating varnishes in the production of laminates intended to have good electrical properties. Examples of laminating varnishes according to the present invention are those having the following compositions Parts by weight Phenolic reactant 100 44 Formalin 60 Drying oil 5 50 Sulphuric acid CS9 1.8 a minor amount e.g. 0.3 Hexamine 2 A plasticiser 0 60 Solvents to give resin content of 4060 , preferably 50 . Examples of suitable drying oils are linseed oil, tung oil and dehydrated castor oil. An example of a suitable plasticiser is cresyl diphenyl phosphate. Examples of suitable solvents are toluene and methanol, preferably mixtures thereof. The invention will now be described with reference to the following Example.Example E A laminate was prepared using a phenolic reactant which was a mixture of unmodified phenol 40 by weight and isomeric isopropyl phenols enriched in the meta isomer 60 by weight . The isomeric isopropyl phenols used in the phenolic reactant was derived by alkylation of phenol with propylene followed by isomerisation of the crude alkylate. The isomerised product forming the isomeric isopropyl phenols had the following composition. phenol 33.6 2 isopropyl phenol 6.8 3 isopropyl phenol 36.1 4 isopropyl phenol 10.4 2,4 diisopropyl phenol 1.8 3,5 diisopropyl phenol 3.6 2,6 diisopropyl phenol 0.4 Miscellaneous unknown compounds to 100 by weight. The following reactants were used to produce the resin solution initially Parts by weight Phenolic reactant 100 44 Formalin 60 Tung oil 20 Sulphuric acid SG 1.84 0.3 Hexamine 2.0 Cresyl diphenyl phosphate 30 Toluene 25 Methanol 25 The phenolic reactant was charged to a reactor fitted with a reflux condenser followed by the sulphuric acid and the reactor contents heated to 90 1100C. The tung oil was added to the reactor over a 10 minute period, the reactor contents were held at 90 1100C for another 10 minutes and then cooled to 600C. The hexamine was added to the reactor as a slurry in water followed by the formalin aqueous solution of formaldehyde . The reactor contents were then heated to reflux at atmospheric pressure and refluxed for 30 minutes. The reactor contents were then evaporated at reduced pressure of about 25 inches Hg 635 mm Hg at 900C, and held under these conditions until the hot plate gel time at 1700C was 75 85 sec.The hot plate gel time is determined by applying a sample of the reactor contents to a metal plate at the indicated temperature and observing the time of the liquid to gel. The cresyl diphenyl phosphate followed by the solvents were then added and the reactor contents mixed and cooled.Tests A D Comparative tests not according to the invention . Experiments were carried out as in Example E above but using in place of the isomeric mixture of phenols 100 phenol alone Test A 40 42 m cresol Test B 80 20 weight ratio of phenol styrene Test C 60 40 weight ratio of phenol nonyl phenol Test D . In the case of the phenol styrene, styrenated phenol was made in situ by adding the styrene over a period to the phenol sulphuric acid at 90 1100C before the drying oil was added. The properties of the resin solutions obtained in Tests A D and Example E are shown in Table 1.
