# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETECTING SUBSTANCES AND FOR REGULATING CURRENT

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for detecting liquids, vapors and gases, which includes a conventional detection device 10 operated in a non linear region or current saturated condition so that it becomes sensitive even to substances having a Van der Waals constant a of nine or less. A change in the level of either the current from battery 26 through the detection device 10 or the voltage across the detection device 10 occurs upon exposure of the device 10 to the substance being sensed. This current or voltage change is then detected by indicating means 28 to indicate the presence of the sensed substance. The relatively small current or voltage change associated with the detection device 10 may be easily sensed by placing the detection device 10 in a balanced bridge circuit. Further, the bridge circuit enables easy, accurate normalization of the apparatus in a reference environment. The non linear characteristics of the detecting device 10 allow it to be employed as a regulator for supplying a constant current to a power consuming device.
