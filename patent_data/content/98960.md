# MULTI SPINDLE WORK TRANSFER DEVICE

## Abstract
A machine tool comprising a base having a work zone including a drive gear, a work shuttle assembly including a pair of work stations each having at least one work spindle and an idler gear, means for mounting the work shuttle assembly on the base for displacement between first and second positions selected to alternately locate each of the work stations at the work zone and at a load unload zone, and means for presenting each of the work spindles at a predetermined orientation at the work and load unload zones including a gear rack mounted on the base for engaging each of the idler gears as the shuttle is displaced from one to another of the positions, the gear rack having at least a portion of the teeth thereof removed proximate the drive gear whereby the idler gear of the station located at the work zone will be operatively associated with the drive gear but will not be operatively associated with the gear rack, means for preventing the rotation of the drive gear as the work shuttle assembly is displaced between the two posi tions and for preventing the rotation of the drive gear when the work shuttle assembly is located at either of the two positions, and means for locking the work shuttle assembly at either of the two positions.
