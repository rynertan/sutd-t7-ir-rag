# Integrated circuit with an input protective device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device with an improved input pro tecting device which can operate stably without being de stroyed by a surge voltage. An input protecting transistor is connected an electrical path between an external terminal and a functional transistor. A gate of the input protecting transistor is connected to a predetermined voltage through a resistor so that a gate po tential of the potecting transistor is allowed to rise easily when a surge voltage is applied to the external.
