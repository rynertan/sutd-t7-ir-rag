## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING SODIUM PEROARBONATE The present invention relates to a process for preparing sodium percarbonate, 2Na2O03.3R202. As is known, sodium percarbonate may be prepared by reacting, at ambient pressure, sodium carbonate with an hydrogen peroxide solution. The reaction heat is removed from the reactor by outside cooling in order to prevent the temperature from rising, which could result in decomposition of the product. The product is then dried. According to this process, the hydrogen peroxide solution must be fed slowly and gradually to the reactor containing sodium carbonate in order to avoid overheating of the product. As a consequence, the reaction times are long. Furthermore it is necessary to use concentrated hydrogen peroxide to minimize product decomposition phenomena, the product stability decreasing as the water amount increases. Moreover, the resulting product possesses a rather high brittleness. The present invention accordingly aims to provide a process for preparing sodium percarbonate which does not require either cooling or heating and permits an easy control of the temperature of the mass being reacted, whereby it is possible to employ short reaction times while obtaining a high reactor productivity. It is also desired to be able to utilize, optionally, a relatively dil ute hydrogen peroxide solution. It is further desired to be able to obtain a product having a low brittleness, with a high content of active oxygen and a good stability. The present invention provides a process for preparing sodium percarbonate, according to which sodium carbonate and an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide having a H202 concentration of from 40 to 80 by weight are reacted in the presence of a stabilizer of percarbonate, and the product is then dried. The process is characterized in that the reaction is conducted under reduced pressure and in that the reduced pressure and the feeding rate of the hydrogen peroxide solution to the reactor containing the sodium carbonate are adjusted so as to maintain the reaction mass at a temperature from 20 to 4000. The process according to the invention is generally accomplished under substantially adiabatic conditions since the reaction heat is eliminated, due to the reduced pressure, as evaporation heat of the water introduced into the reaction system through the hydrogen peroxide solution. After having fixed the temperature range in which the process will be operated, a reduced pressure is created such as to ensure the water evaporation at these temperatures, whereupon the hydrogen peroxide solution is introduced at such a rate as not to exceed the pre assigned temperature values. The reaction temperature ranges from 20 to 4000. When operating below 200C, the reaction times tend to be too long, while when the process is operated above 4000 sodium percarbonate tends to decompose. Preferably the process is operated at temperatures ranging from 25 to 3500. The residual pressure does not generally exceed 60 mm of Hg usually the residual pressure is from 10 to 30 mm of Hg. The H202 concentration of the hydrogen peroxide solution ranges from 40 to 80 by weight. When the process is operated at an H202 concentration below 40 , the reaction times are too long and the product may decompose during the reaction step. Preferably, a hydrogen peroxide solution at a H202 concentration of from 60 to 70 is used. The starting sodium carbonate may be, for example, anhydrous Na2003 or Na2003.H20. Preferably, anhydrousNa2C03 is employed, Drying of the product is generally carried out at temperatures ranging from 40 to 600C. The drying may take place under static conditions, for example in a chamber through which a hot air stream is made to flow, or under dynamic conditions, for example in a fluidized bed. As sodium percarbonate stabilizers it is possible to utilize substances already known for such purposes such as, for example, magnesium salts, alkaline salts of polycarboxylic acids, sodium phosphonates, sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium pyrophosphate, sodium orthosilicate and sodium metasilicate. Particularly satisfactory results are obtained by using magnesium silicate. The amount of stabilizer may range, for example, from 0.5 to 5 g per mole of sodium percarbonate0 The molar ratio between H202 and Na2CO3 is generally from 0.8 to 1.8. However, if the process is operated with molar ratios lower than the stoichiometric value of 1.5, the active oxygen content of the product is rather low, although still sufficient to allow the utilization of the product in detergent formulations.If the process is operated with a molar ratio higher than 1.8, there is a considerable loss of H202. Preferably the process is operated with a molar ratio ranging from 1.6 to 1.7. To obtain a good granulometry of percarbonate it is preferable to use a granular sodium carbonate having a small amount of product with a particle size exceeding 0.8 mm of mesh size of the screen and a small amount of product with a particle size below 0.16 mm of mesh size of the screen the mesh size of the screen is the distance between two parallel and subsequent wires . The reaction may be conducted in a mixer capable of ensuring intimate contact between the reagents, and which is vacuum tight. After drying, the product is screened to remove the coarsest fraction generally the one above 008 mm of mesh size of the screen as well as the finest fraction generally the one below 0.16 mm of mesh size of the screen . The coarsest fraction can be ground and recycled, along with the finest one, to the reaction step.This product recycle does not impair either the accomplishment of the process or the granulometry of the final product. The resulting product exhibits a granular morphology with a smooth surface. Its content of active oxygen is generally equal to or higher than 14 by weight, The chemical yield, calculated on the basis of sodium carbonate, generally ranges from 85 to 95 . The invention will be further described with reference to the following illustrative Examples.EXAMPlE 1 Starting from granular anhydrous 99.5 Na2003, the fraction having a particle size above 0.8 mm was separated by screening and, after grinding, was returned to the remaining portion of the product. 2,100 g of Na2003, 1,100 g of recycled sodium percarbonate and 53 g of colloidal magnesium silicate were introduced into a reactor. The reactor was a helical double ribbon mixer, type Ribbon Mixer The reactor Åa jacket was heated, at the beginning of the operation, by means of water circulating at 32 330C, in order to avoid heat dispersion. Vacuum was applied and 1,764 g of hydrogen peroxide solution having an H202 concentration of 64 by weight were sucked into the equipment.

On completion of feeding, the mass was kept under stirring, always under reduced pressure, for a further 10 minutes. The product, having a residual moisture of about 10 , was directly transferred into a fluidized bed drier where it was dried, by means of air heated to 44 46 C, for a time period of 15 minutes.
