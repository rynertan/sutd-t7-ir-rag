# Process for making controlled sudsing detergent powder.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing a low sudsing fabric washing powder in which a mixture of a suds suppressant, such as an alkyl phosphoric acid ester or a salt thereof, and a hydrophobic material such as a petroleum jelly or a natural or synthetic wax is combined with a spray dried detergent powder. The temperature of the powder at which combination takes place is lower than the drop melting point of the mixture of suds suppressant and hydrophobic material.
