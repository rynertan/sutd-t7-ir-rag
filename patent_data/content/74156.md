# PISTON IN AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
The invention concerns pistons of the liquid cooled type, and provides an advantageous alternative to the known types of oil or water cooled pistons. The invention is characterised in that the liquid A is sealingly enclosed within a sealed cooling space or chamber provided within the piston 4 so as to form a free surface, in that a heat exchanger 3 for effecting heat transfer between said liquid and oil c supplied to the head exchanger is associated with said sealed space, and in that the oil within said heat exchanger is arranged to be fed and discharged through oil passageways 21, 11 connected to the exterior of the piston. Preferably, the liquid A is a liquid having a boiling point of 200 C or lower at atmospheric pressure, and air, or an inert gas B is sealingly enclosed within said sealed space.
