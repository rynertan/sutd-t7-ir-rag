# PRINTED CIRCUIT ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A circuit arrangement is formed by producing a pattern of a conductive polymer ink upon a moulded plastics substrate. When cured the ink is treated with a palladium compound to promote the electroless deposition of copper or nickel on to the ink. Solder can then be applied to the circuit without damaging the ink.
