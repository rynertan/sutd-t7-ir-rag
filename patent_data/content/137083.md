## Description
1,5 Benzothiazepine derivatives and production thereofThis invention relates to novel benzothiazepine derivatives and a method for producing the same.More particularly, the derivatives of this invention are 2 phenyl or substituted phenyl 2 ,3 dihydro 5 substituted 1,5 benzothiazepine 3,4 5H diones which can be represented by the following formula 1 EMI1.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 each denotes hydrogen, a halogen, a lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy group or a hydroxy group R4 denotes a lower alkyl group, an allyl group, a lower alkoxyalkyl group, a lower alkyl group substituted with a hydroxy group or a halogen, a lower alkylaminoalkyl group or a morpholino lower alkyl group X denotes a halogen or hydrogen, and acid salts thereof.The term lower as used in this specification.includes groups having up to 5 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety. Preferred groups are those having up to 4 carbon atoms.Benzothiazepine derivatives are very interesting compounds, because it is known that some of them have several pharmacological activities. The compounds I of this invention are novel benzothiazepine derivatives having two carbonyl groups in the thiazephine ring which is entirely unknown so far.The compounds have excellent pharmacological effects such as analgesic, antipyretic or antiarrhythmic activities and are useful as medicines.The compounds I may be produced, for example, by the following synthesis route EMI2.1 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and X have the same meaning as aboveAs illustrated in the above schema, the benzothiazine ring of the compound II expands to a benzothiazepine ring by reacting 2 phenyl or substituted phenyl methylidene 4 substituted 2H 1,4 benzothiazine 3 4H one II with a trimethylhalosilane, hydrogen peroxide and water, thereby the compound I is produced in a high yield. The reaction can be carried out in a nonreactive solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform under cooling or at room temperature and it proceeds to completion in a period from scores of minute to several hours.From the resulting reaction mixture, the compound I may be purified by conventional procedure, for example, extraction with a solvent, recrystallization, column chromatography and treatment with activated carbon. The starting compound II can easily be synthesized according to known methods described in V. Baligh andT. Rangarajan, J. Chem. Soc., 1980, 4703 J. Krapcho and C.F. Turk, J. Med. Chem., 1973, 16, 776.Among the compounds I thus obtained, a compound having a nitrogen containing substituent at the 5 position of the benzothiazepine ring can be converted, if desired, to an inorganic acid salt such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, or nitrate, or an organic acid salt such as methanesulfonate, succinate, maleate, or tartrate, by known methods.The ring expansion of a heterocyclic compound is known in very rare cases, and there is no report from other inventor s so far of a ring expansion from the six membered ring of benzothiazine to the seven membered ring of benzothiazepine having two carbonyl groups.The ring expansion of the invention is useful for production of a medicine or an intermediate thereof, because it can be applied to the production of other benzothiazepine derivatives.The compound I of this invention can be employed as an analgesic, antipyretic or antiarrhythmic agent, which may be administered at a daily dose level of 30 to 2,000 mg per kilogram body weight in 3 to 4 installments daily. It may be administered orally or parenterally in varied dosage form such as powder, granules, tablets, capsules, injection, suppository and cartilage.In the case of powder, granules, tablets or capsules, the compound I may be used, for example, in admixture with pharmacologically acceptable excipients such as starch, lactose, sucrose and calcium carbonate binders such as starch, carboxymethylcellulose and crystalline cellulose and lubricants such as talc.Where the compound I is used as an injection, the carrier may, for example, be distilled water or physiological saline. Some pharmacological data and production procedure of the compounds I are described in the following Experiment and Examples Experiment.Pharmacology of 2 4 methoxyphenyl 2,3 dihydro 5 2 dimethyl aminoethyl 1 ,5 benzothiazepine 3,4 5H dione Ia hydrochloride. 1 Minimum Lethal Dose Test in MiceGroups of 2 mice each, weighing 29 36 g, were treated intraperitoneally with the compound and observed for signs of central, autaonomic and toxic responses for 5 hours.
