# A thermal mass flow meter.

## Abstract
A thermal mass flow meter has a channel 21 defined in a substrate 10 . Small elements 16a, 16b, 16c bridge the channel 21 carrying heater or temperature sensor elements 17 of low thermal mass in direct contact with fluid in the channel 21 . The temperature differential between the sensor elements 17 , when the device is in operation, is indicative of the thermal mass flow rate.
