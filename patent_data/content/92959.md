# A method of coating a metal substrate with a protective aluminium silicon coating, a metal substrate having the coating, and the use of the coated metal substrate.

## Abstract
A method of coating metal substrates with a protective aluminium silicon coating by applying thereto a mixture comprising a an Al Si eutectic, Al Si hypereutectic or elemental aluminium and b elemental silicon, and heating the coating sufficiently to form liquid eutectic containing solid elemental silicon, and then cooling. The resulting coating has a net silicon content of from abut 20 to 80 weight . The invention also provides articles of manufacture comprising said coating and a method of carrying out thermal hydrocarbon processing operations where corro sion erosion and other high temperature interactions are normally a problem, using apparatus comprising metal substrates having said coatings.
