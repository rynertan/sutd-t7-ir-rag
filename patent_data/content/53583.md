# Apparatus for drawing feed from cylindrical bales of hay, straw or other provender.

## Abstract
It has become common practice to gather hay, straw or other provender into large, heavy cylindrical bales and there exist a variety of apparatus designed for subsequent extraction of the feed therefrom. The invention relates to like apparatus, proposing both improvements and simplification with regard to existing types. To this end there is a mobile conveyor platform 1 furnished with teeth 4 which draw the bale 24 on, urging it against a backprop, or stay 9 this also producing movement in order to assist rotation of the bale. At the same time, the conveyor platform s 1 teeth strip feed from the bale and carry it onto a further mobile conveyor platform below 5 which in turn takes and carries the feed to the discharge outlet.

## Description
Apparatus for drawing feed from cylindrical bales of hay, straw or other provenderIt has become standard practice in recent times to bale hay, straw or other like crops into large, heavy cylindrical bundles by rolling up a single layer of the crop arranged into a band, or mat so as to spiral into the appropriate shape.Normally speaking these bales are utilised by being introduced direct to the stall, where there will be one of a variety of apparatus designed for withdrawal of the feedtfrom the bale during its gradual distribution to each station, or into each manger.In short, apparatus of this kind must unwind the bale and draw the feed therefrom in order to render it suitable for the intended purpose.In practice, existing apparatus are possessed of a variety of drawbacks, for instance, tendency to clog easily, inability to continue drawing out the feed to the end of the band that is, complete unwinding of the bale, as well as being difficult to operate and manoeuvre, complicated, costly, and time consuming and expensive to maintain etc. etc. as users are well aware.One object of the invention described herein is that of obtaining entire withdrawal of the feed right to the end of the band which forms the complete bale.Another object is that of ensuring the avoidance of clogging.Yet another object is that of creating a simply con structed apparatus, easy to maintain and in particularreliable with regard to normal function.A further object is ease of operation hence obviating the need for skilled personnel.A further object still is that of permitting greater ease of manoeuvre.In the case qf the apparatus to which. the invention relates, the cylindrical bale is deposited by whatever means connected to the apparatus or otherwise Onto a moving surface, with its cylindrical axis horizontally disposed the moving surface comprising, for instance, a succession of traverse members furnished with teeth, the said members connecting with looped tractive elements such as belts or chains.This surface provides downwardly inclined movement in order to ensure the bale s being carried towards, and urged against a rearwardly inclined stay, adjustable for angle of inclination, likewise comprising looped drag elements e.g. belts or chains carrying plain traverse members the stay s function being that of imparting rotation to the bale while the teeth on the moving surface gradually strip away the substance of the bale itself.That which is stripped from the bale is drawn subsequently towards an opening left free between the said surface and the lower extremity of the stay, and down into a lower section where a second conveyor, ideally similar to the first and having teeth of greater length than those of the first so as to interpose therewith, removes the feed therefrom and carries it toward the discharge.The uppermost branch of the said lower, or second conveyor moves in the same direction as the lower branch of the first, or upper conveyor, travelling at a greater speed in order to ensure the removal of feed from the latter.The three conveyors are mounted onto a chassis provided with three side panels which both prevent the feed from dispersing into unwanted areas and oblige it to be channelled in the desired direction.The said chassis is wheeled, preferably, the front pair of which being dolly steered, and provided with a coupling for towing by tractor or the like.The afore mentioned loop arrangements are caused to move simultaneously by a transmission link, ideally a single unit for example by chain with drive imparted from any suitable motorised means, most desirable of which being prop shaft and universal joint linked to a tractor power take off.The lower conveyor teeth are offset with respect to those of the upper, and preferably less in number.The invention will now be described in greater detail, from which a clearer notion will emerge of a preferred, though not exclusive form of embodiment, illustrated as an unlimited example with the aid of the accompanying drawings, in which Fig 1 is a schematic representation of the entire apparatus, shown in perspective Fig 2 shows the cross section of three drag loops, according to a vertical plane, demonstrating the preferred respective dispositions of same Fig 3 shows the front face view of the apparatus, revealing its drive transmission arrangement.With reference to the above drawings, 1 denotes a first endless conveyor which basically comprises a mat, or surface rotating in one direction only. The said conveyor consists of looped belts or chains 2 which carry traverse members 3 furnished with teeth 4, set apart and forwardly inclined with respect to the direction of movement, preferably at an angle of 450. 5 denotes a second endless conveyor disposed below the first and offering full face thereto, likewise basically comprising looped belts or chains 6 as well as traverse members 7, these too furnished with teeth, or barbs 8, the latter similarly inclined at an angle of 450 although conversely that is rearwardly with respect to the direction of movement and being of greater length than teeth. 4 sO as to interpose with.the initial ranks of the latter on their return stretch and withdraw the feed therefrom. The up turn extremity of conveyor 5 protrudes for a nominal distance beyond the down tu rn extremity of conveyor 1.9 denotes a backprop section, or stay, this also co n prising an endless conveyor consisting of looped belts or chains 10 carrying smooth traverse members 11 set apart so as to stand in relief thereby gripping the bale through friction. The said backprop, or stay 9 extends upward in a vertical or more ideally in a slightly rearwardly angled direction from a line overlying the down turn extremity of conveyor 1. The distance existing between the lower extremity of the stay and the first conveyor establishes an opening 15 of sufficient breadth for avoidance of collision between stay 9 and conveyor 1.The conveyor itself defining stay 9 is motor driven and revolves in one direction only, its sense of rotation being identical to that of conveyor 1, its running speed being less than that of the same said conveyor 1.12 13 denote side panels which in the embodiment referred to herein combine with the loop support shafts to form the chassis of the apparatus the function of the said panels 12 13 beigg to provide forward and rear stops, preventing the feed from spilling out as well as containing and channelling the same towards the opening 15 existing between stay 9 and conveyor 1, the said opening preventing these last from coming into contact, as previously mentioned. 14 denotes a lateral side panel which, in addition to preventing outward spillage of feed, provides a safety shield for the operator s , and makes for the possibility if desired of a guide moulding 30 which assists the imposition of enforced passage of the feed in a downward direction.31 16 denote two further side panels which extend upward in like manner to panel 14 these constituting chassis components for stay conveyor loop 9 as well as performing the function of feed retaining walls and protective shield for operator s .A towing bar is indicated by 17, providing the means for linkage to the prime mover, a tractor for example 19 denotes two rear wheels and 29 two front wheels, these latter being dolly steered.20 denotes slack take up devices for obtaining correct tension in the different drag loops.21, 22 23 denote the transmission arrangement between motor and driven parts in the apparatus, being pinions, chain and motor power take off respectively.32 represents a floor, or tray positioned between the two branches of conveyor 5 serving to prevent smaller particles of feed from falling to the ground the apparatus being, ideally, without a recognisable base as such this in order to avoid would be redundant accumulations thereon, as well as to simplify running and maintenance.Conveyor 1 produces downwardly inclined movement with respect to and towards stay 9, the latter in turn being rearwardly inclined, whilst conveyor 5 is disposed either horizontally or inclined marginally, in the opposite direction to that of conveyor 1.The apparatus functions in the following manner the cylindrical bale 24 is deposited onto conveyor 1 by whatever means connected to the apparatus or other wise in such a way that its initial stretch 25 faces towards opening 15, and that the bale itself leans against stay 9.The apparatus is then put in motion causing teeth 4 to draw the underside of bale 24 occasioning both urging of the latter against stay 9, and channelling of feed therefrom into opening 15 from whence it will drop onto lower conveyor 5.Teeth 4 continue drawing off faed from bale 24 thus causing the latter to unwind, stay 9 assisting therewith by dint of its imparting upward movement to the bale thereby obliging same to rotate as per the arrow fig 2 teeth 4 are enabled to grip and strip the bale the more effectively thanks to the slower speed with which backprop, or stay 9 travels in relation thereto thus stay 9 provides a retard mechanism by curbing the speed of rotation imparted to the bale 24 by conveyor 1.In consequence, teeth 4 advance at greater speed than that of the bale s cylindrical surface thus teeth 4 are able to strip feed from the bale thoroughly and evenly by virtue of their uniformly engaging the entire cylindrical surface area thereof.Feed stripped from the bale by conveyor 1 is carried into the area denoted by 28 this extending the width of conveyor 1 itself and enclosed from without by lateral side panel 14 from whence it drops into the space beneath, there to be gathered up by lower conveyor 5 whose barbs 8 collect same from teeth 4 the more effectively since these a travel at greater speed than the latter 4 and carry it forward to the farther free extremity 26 causing its fall therefrom into the manger or in the vicinity of the litter.The barbs 8 of conveyor 5 are inclined rearwardly with respect to the conveyor s forward movement, see Fig 2 in order both to ensure drawing on of feed, and to make certain of its disengagement from same 8 at free extremity 26 where it must be discharged.It will be seen further from Fig 2 that conveyors 1 5 open out V fashion toward the exit, this in order to preclude the possibility of teeth 4 continuing to draw feed along during their underside return on conveyor 1In the event that bale 24 should be deposited onto surface 1 contrariwise to the manner described that is, at variance with the natural unwinding spiral nothing is altered, as teeth 4 will continue to strip off feed and carry it towards opening 15.The angle of inclination of stay 9 may be made variable, for instance by adjustment at rotary shaft 27.Provision is made further for gathering up of feed discharged at 26 into a trough, for example, from whence it may be cast into the appropriate space for consumption, perhaps by means of a pneumatic thrower.Ideally and as an added means of reducing overall dimensions of the apparatus one extremity of conveyor 1 should terminate at the foot of stay 9, whilst the corresponding conveyor 5 extremity be extended further a short space, the better to gather feed falling thereonto.Shaft 40 that is, the down turn shaft around which conveyor 1 is looped is furnished with longitudinal laminar elements 41 protruding radially therefrom between traverse members 3 so as to extend beyond the conveyor surface 1 for a radial distance all but greater than the extremity of teeth 4. Thus it comes about that the feed, once grasped and carried along by teeth 4 to the. down turn at shaft 40, is withdrawn therefrom 4 hence from conveyor 1 by dint of the action of elements 41, enabling its fall onto conveyor 5 therebelow.In short, these elements 41 serve as added assurance for the withdrawal of feed from the teeth of conveyor 1.Notwithstanding the embodiment described herein is towed, there is nothing to prevent the apparatus from being self propelled, or its internal mechanism from being independently driven.Numerous modifications of a practical nature may be applied to the constructional details of the invention without by any means straying from within the bounds of protection afforded to the concept thereof as described above, and as claimed below.
