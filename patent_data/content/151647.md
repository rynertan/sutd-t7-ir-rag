# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING A LOW PRESSURE MERCURY VAPOR ARC LAMP.

## Abstract
Both leg portions 1a , 1b of a U shaped bulb 1 are disposed such as to abut against each other or such as to oppose each other with a gap 31 therebetween. The bulb 1 is mounted on and end plate 10 in such a manner that leg ends 1a , 1b of the bulb 1 are in contact with the end plate 10 , thereby forming an electric discharge passage. If an external force is applied to the bulb 1 in the direction in which the leg portions 1a , 1b come close to each other, the leg portions 1a , 1b abut against each other within limits imposed by the range of the elastic deformation of a connecting portion 2a of the bulb 1 , so that breakage of the bulb 1 is prevented. Thus, it is possible to facilitate the manufacture of a low pressure mercury vapor are lamp while reducing the size thereof.
