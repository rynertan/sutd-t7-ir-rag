# Electrical discharge machining apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrical discharge machining apparatus in which a workpiece 5 is machined by generating an electrical discharge between the workpiece 5 and an electrode 3 . The electrode 3 faces the workpiece 5 , which is immersed in a machining liquid 2 . A blower 30 is provided for forcing cooling air into the interior of a bed 10 , a column 9 , and a head 8 of the apparatus, thereby cooling the interior of the bed 10 , column 9 , and head 8 . Furthermore, exhaust from the cooler 30 for air cooling the machining liquid 2 is used as cooling air so as to reduce thermal effects on the bed 10 , column 9 , and head 8 by the machining liquid 2 , which reaches a high temperature during the course of machining.
