# Detergent composition.

## Abstract
A material for depositing perfume on a surface comprises particles having a size of 0.1 to 2000 microns, the particles containing a perfume and a matrix material, the matrix material being a cationic component, optionally together with a nonion ic component. When the nonionic component is present the cationic to nonionic ratio is at least 5 1. The particles may be incorporated in a solid or liquid fabric washing detergent com position or hard surface cleaner. Suitable cationic materials in clude quaternary ammonium compounds. Suitable nonionic materials include esters of polyhydric alcohols, fatty alcohols and derivatives thereof. Compared to products containing the same amount of perfume in the free state, the products of the invention give improved deposition and perfume retention on the treated surfaces.
