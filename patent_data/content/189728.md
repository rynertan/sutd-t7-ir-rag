## Description
The present invention concerns a cathodic electrodepositable resin composition according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 1. The invention also concerns a method of depositing by cathodic electrodeposition according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 6, an aqueous cathodic electrodepositable coating both according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 11 and a coated article according to the precharacterizing portion of claim 16. The field of art to which this invention pertains is epoxy resins, and, more specifically, epoxy resin compositions containing blocked isocyanate cross linking agents for use in cathodic electrocoat processes. The use of electrodepositable resin compositions in aqueous baths to coat objects is well known in the art. Typically, a resinous composition, which has been mixed with a cross linking composition to form an electrodepositable coating composition, is salted with an acid so that the composition is solubilized in water. The aqueous coating composition is thought to be closer to a dispersion than a true solution and is typically described as solubilized rather than dissolved. The resins typically used are epoxide resins which have been either reacted with or adducted with amines. The amine is necessary so that a nitrogen atom is available to be salted by an acid to solubilize the composition in water. Solubilization is typically done by feeding an electrodepositable resin composition into a reactor vessel containing an organic or inorganic acid and water. The electrodeposition bath generally contains an anode, immersed in the bath, which is connected to a DC electric circuit. An article to be coated must comprise an electrically conductive material such as metal. The article is connected to the previously mentioned DC circuit and functions as the cathode. The article is dipped into the bath wherein electrons flow through the cathode to the anode, i.e. conventional current flow from the anode to the cathode. Simultaneously, positively charged particles of the electrodepositable coating composition are transported and deposited on the surfaces of the cathodic article. The film thickness of the deposited film is a function of time, current flow, conductivity, etc., and is related to the resinous composition utilized in the bath. The current flow diminishes as the deposited film layer increases in thickness due to the electrically insulating properties of the coating. The coated article is then removed from the bath after the desired thickness is achieved and typically baked in an oven as a curing step resulting in the cross linking or curing of the coating composition, thereby producing a hard, corrosion resistant coating. Although there are many patents covering compositions of this type, some of the more typical patents are described below. US A 4,031,050 discloses cationic electrodepositable compositions comprising amine epoxy resin adducts and blocked polyisocyanates. US A 3,984,299 describes a cathodic electrocoating method for applying a composition comprising an amino containing epoxy resin and an oxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agent, using as the oxime the reaction product of methylethyl ketone and hydroxylamine Cationic epoxide amine reaction products used as electrodepositable coating resins are disclosed in US A 4,182,833. This patent also discloses the use of blocked polyisocyanate cross linking compositions. US A 4,104,147 discloses electrodepositable cationic chain extended polyepoxides, wherein the molecule is extended with an organic polyol, which is adducted with a secondary amine and cured with capped or blocked isocyanate derivatives. US A 4,225,479 discloses electrodepositable resin compositions comprising the reaction product of a polyepoxide resin and a primary amine. This patent also discloses the use of cross linking agents such as aminoplast resins, phenoplast resins and blocked polyisocyanates. US A 4,093,594 discloses polyepoxide resins adducted with polyamines using an excess of amine. The resins are then reacted with a monoepoxide or a monocarboxylic acid, and, when reacted with an acid, form water soluble or dispersible resins useful to coat objects in cathodic electrodeposition processes. An improved process for the preparation of cationic resins wherein polyepoxide resins are contacted with particular polyether polyols and then reacted with cationic base group formers such as an amine or an acid is disclosed in US A 4,419,467. The cathodic electrodepositable coating compositions known in the art have several disadvantages associated with their use including inadequate film build and throwpower, high bake temperatures, and rough film surfaces. Build is defined as film thickness. Throwpower relates to the capacity to coat areas of the cathodic article which are remote or shielded from the anode. Throwpower is defined as the rate of deposition of film relative to the position of the anode. While great strides have been made in this area of electrodepositable coating compositions, there is a constant search for improvements in this technology such as high film build, high throwpower, smooth film surfaces and low cross linking temperatures. In particular, it is recognized in the art that electrodepositable resin compositions containing ketoxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agents cure at lower temperatures but produce coatings having rough surfaces. Roughness of a coating can be determined visually by comparing the coating to a standard coating and noting the differences in gloss, smoothness, etc. The roughness of a coating can also be measured by an instrument known as a profilometer. Rough surfaces are typically seen in coatings which are deposited by conventional cathodic electrodeposition processes from resins containing polyisocyanates blocked with oximes known in the art such as methylethyl ketoxime and cyclohexanone oxime. These rough surfaces are typified by a sandy, gritty, uneven, nonuniform appearance with little or no gloss or reflectance. The smoothness of an electrodeposited coating composition relates to the flow of the deposited composition during the baking process. Flow is defined as the tendency of the electrodeposited cathodic resin composition particles to liquify or melt and coalesce in the presence of heat prior to the onset of cross linking. It is critical in obtaining a smooth surface that little or no cross linking occur prior to flow. Accordingly what is needed in the art are cathodic electrodepositable coating compositions which solve the problems of the prior art. The resin composition of the present invention is defined according to the characterizing portion of claims The reacting method of the present invention is defined according to the characterizing portion of claim 6, the aqueous cathodic electrodepositable coating both of the present invention is defined according to the characterizing portion of claim 11 and the coated article of the present invention is defined according to the characterizing portion of claim 16. According to the present invention it has been found that novel cathodic electrodepositable resin compositions comprising an amine containing epoxy resin and an oxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agent produce a film forming composition which is curable after deposition at a temperature of 107 C 225 F to 121 C 250 F . The films formed are durable and smooth. The improvement comprises the use in the cathodic electrodepositable resin composition of an oxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agent wherein the oxime is the reaction product of an aliphatic carbonyl containing compound having at least 7 carbon atoms and hydroxyl amine. Another aspect of this invention is an improved method of depositing a resin composition comprising an amine containing epoxy resin and an oxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agent on a conductive substrate in an electrodeposition process, by forming an aqueous dispersion by solubilizing the resin composition with an acid, forming an aqueous dispersion, immersing the substrate in the aqueous dispersion, connecting the substrate to an electric current such that the substrate serves as a cathode, passing a direct current through the substrate for a sufficient time such that a film of said composition is deposited thereon, thereby producing a coating curable after deposition at 107 C 225 F to 121 C 250 F and a smooth, durable epoxy resin coating. The improvement comprises the use of an oxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agent wherein the oxime is the reaction product of an aliphatic carbonyl containing compound having at least 7 carbon atoms and hydroxyl amine. Another aspect of this invention is an aqueous cathodic electrodepositable coating composition comprising an acid solubilized amine containing epoxy resin and an improved oxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agent, said coating composition capable of producing a film curable after deposition at 107 C 225 F to 121 C 250 F to a durable, smooth film. The improvement comprises the use of an oxime blocking agent comprising the reaction product of an aliphatic carbonyl group containing compound and hydroxyl amine. Another aspect of this invention is a coated article coated with a cationic electrodepositable amine containing epoxy resin composition containing an oxime blocked polyisocyanate, wherein the article is coated by solubilizing a sufficient amount of said composition in an aqueous bath containing an anode to form an aqueous dispersion by acid salting said composition, connecting an electrically conductive article to a DC electric circuit to act as a cathode, immersing the article in the bath and passing a sufficient direct current across the article for a sufficient amount of time to produce a coating of said composition on said article, removing the article from the bath, and then curing said film, at 107 C 225 F to 121 C 250 F , thereby producing a durable, smooth coating. The improvement comprises the use of the oxime blocking agent comprising the reaction product of an aliphatic carbonyl containing compound having at least 4 carbon atoms and hydroxyl amine. The foregoing, and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description. According to the present invention ketones or aldehydes having at least 7 carbon atoms may be used in the practice of this invention. Example of these compounds include methyl amyl ketone, heptyl aldehyde, etc. These compounds are well known and commercially available. It is preferred to use methyl n amyl ketone in the practice of this invention. Methyl n amyl ketone is a commercially available liquid having the formula CH₃ CH₂ CH₂ CH₂ CH₂ C O CH₃. Methyl n amyl ketoxime blocking agent is made by reacting methyl n amyl ketone with hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine is a commercially available crystalline substance having the formula NH₂OH. In the practice of this invention the hydroxyl amine salts such as hydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydroxylamine sulfate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, hydroxylamine acid sulfate, etc., are preferably used. The use of the term hydroxylamine is defined to mean the compound itself or the previously mentioned salts. The methyl n amyl ketoxime is made by reacting sufficient quantities of methyl n amyl ketone with an hydroxylamine salt for a sufficient amount of time at a sufficient temperature so that the reaction product is formed. Typically, 1.6 to 2 moles of methyl n amyl ketone are charged into a conventional reactor vessel along with 1 to 2 moles of hydroxylamine salt and 2 moles of NaOH, etc. The reactor charge is stirred and reacted at a temperature of typically 4 C 25 F to 100 C 212 F , more typically 27 C 80 F to 71 C 160 F , and preferably 38 C 100 F to 54 C 130 F . The methyl n amyl ketoxime is removed from the reactor vessel by separation from the aqueous layer. The reaction conditions are essentially the same as the above mentioned when reacting the other ketones or aldehydes used in the practice of this invention with hydroxyl amine to form the oximes of the present invention. The organic polyisocyanates used in the practice of this invention are typical of those used in the art, e.g., US A 4,182,831. Useful blocked polyisocyanates are those which are stable in the dispersion systems at ordinary room temperature and which react with the resinous product of this invention at elevated temperatures. In the preparation of the blocked organic polyisocyanates, any suitable organic polyisocyanate can be used. Representative examples are the aliphatic compounds such as trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, hexamethylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,2 butylene, 2,3 butylene and 1,3 butylene diisocyanates the aromatic compounds such as m phenylene, phenylene, 4,4 diphenyl, and 1,4 naphthalene diisocyanates the aliphatic aromatic compounds such as 4,4 diphenylene methane, 2,4 or 2,6 tolylene, or mixtures thereof, 4,4 toluidine, and 1,4 xylylene diisocyanates the triisocyanates such as triphenyl methane 4,4 4 triisocyanate, 1,3,5 triisocyanate benzene and 2,4,6 triisocynate toluene and the tetraisocyanates such as 4,4 diphenyl dimethyl methane 2,2 ,5,5 tetraisocyanate the polymerized polyisocyanates such as tolylene diisocyanate dimers and trimers, polymethylenepolyphenylene polyisocyanates having NCO functionalities of 2 to 3, and the like. In addition, the organic polyisocyanate can be prepolymer derived from a polyol such as glycols, e.g. ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, as well as other polyols such as glycerol, trimethylolpropane, hexanetriol, pentaerythritol, and the like, as well as monoethers, such as diethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol and the like and polyethers, i.e., alkylene oxide condensates of the above. Among the alkylene oxides that may be condensed with these polyols to form polyethers are ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide and the like. These are generally called hydroxyl terminated polyethers and can be linear or branched. Especially useful polyether polyols are those derived from reacting polyols such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,4 butylene glycol, 1,3 butylene glycol, 1,6 hexanediol, and their mixtures glycerol, trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, 1,2,6 hexanetriol, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, polypentaerythritol, sorbitol, methyl glucosides, sucrose and the like with alkylene oxides such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, their mixtures, and the like. Particularly preferred polyisocyanates include the reaction product of toluene diisocyanate and trimethylol propane and, the isocyanurate of hexamethylene diisocyanate. The blocked polyisocyanates are formed by reacting sufficient quantities of blocking agent with sufficient quantities of organic polyisocyanate at a sufficient temperature for a sufficient amount of time under reaction conditions conventional in this art such that no free isocyanate groups are present when the reaction has run its course. Typically about one mole of polyisocyanate is charged into a conventional reactor vessel. Typically about one mole to about five moles of oxime is added, more typically about two moles to about five moles, preferably about two moles to about four moles. In addition one or more of the following compositions is charged methyl isobutyl ketone, butanol, methyl ethyl ketone, toluol, or an equivalent organic solvent. The reaction temperature varies with the type of polyisocyanate used, for example, when reacting toluene disocyanate trimethanol propane with a ketoxime, the reaction is typically carried out at 66 C 150 F to 104 C 220 F , more typically 71 C 160 F to 99 C 210 F , and preferably 82 C 180 F to 93 C 200 F . The reactor charge is mixed for 15 minutes to 120 minutes, more typically 20 minutes to 40 minutes, and preferably 25 minutes to 35 minutes. The ketoxime blocked polyisocyanate is left in solution after the reaction is complete. The cathodic electrodepositable coating compositions of this invention comprise epoxy resins which may optionally be chain extended resulting in an increase in the molecular weight of the epoxy molecules by reacting with water miscible or water soluble polyols. The epoxides useful in the practice of this invention are the polyepoxides typically used in this art and comprise a resinous material containing at least one epoxy group per molecule. A particularly useful class of polyepoxides are the glycidyl polyethers of polyhydric phenols. Such polyepoxide resins are derived from an epihalohydrin and a dihydric phenol and have an epoxide equivalent weight of 400 to 4,000. Examples of epihalohydrins are epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin and epiiodohydrin with epichlorohydrin being preferred. Dihydric phenols are exemplified by resorcinol, hydroquinone, p,p dihydroxydiphenylpropane or Bisphenol A as it is commonly called , p,p dihydroxybenzophenone, p,p dihydroxydiphenyl, p,p dihydroxydiphenyl ethane, bis 2 hydroxynaphthy methane, 1,5 dihydroxynaphthylene and the like with Bisphenol A being preferred. These polyepoxide resins are well known in the art and are made in desired molecular weights by reacting the epihalohydrin and the dihydric phenol in various ratios or by reacting a dihydric phenol with a lower molecular weight polyepoxide resin. Particularly preferred polyepoxide resins are glycidyl polyethers of Bisphenol A having epoxide equivalent weights of 450 to 2,000, more typically 800 to 1,600 and preferably 800 to 1,500.

Examples are glycidyl adipate and glycidyl phthalate. Also useful are polyepoxides derived from the epoxidation of an olefinically unsaturated alicyclic compound. Included are diepoxides comprising in part one or more monoepoxides. These polyepoxides are nonphenolic and are obtained by the epoxidation of alicyclic olefins. For example, by oxygen and selected method catalysts, by perbenzoic acids, by acetaldehyde monoperacetate, or by peracetic acid. Among such polyepoxides are the epoxy alicyclic ethers and esters which are well known in the art.

Although the oxime blocked polyisocyanate cross linking agents of the present invention can be used successfully with conventional amine containing epoxy resins known in the cathodic electrodeposition art, it is preferable to use modified epoxy resins. Specifically, the modified epoxy resins used in the practice of this invention will comprise one of the aforementioned epoxy resin compositions chain extended with a water miscible or water soluble polyol, reacted with excess amine, and finally reacted with a fatty acid or aliphatic monoepoxide. The water soluble or water miscible polyols, used to optionally chain extend epoxy resins, include organic polyols containing at least one and preferably two alcohol primary hydroxyls. Mixtures of organic polyols may be used in the practice of this invention, as well as mixtures of organic polyols and primary mono primary alcohols. These organic polyols will have a molecular weight of 200 to 3,000, more typically 300 to 1,000, and preferably 400 to 700. Water miscible is defined as the ability or tendency of the polyol to mix or blend uniformly with water. By water soluble is meant the ability or tendency of the polyol to blend uniformly with water. The organic polyols which are used in the practice of this invention are those known in the art, e.g. polyols disclosed in US A 4,104,147. The water soluble or water miscible polyols which are used to generate the modified epoxy resins of this invention include the aliphatic polyols, the aromatic polyols, alkylene polyols, butadiene polyols, and butadiene acrylonitrile polyols.

F. Goodrich Chemical Corp., Cleveland, Ohio. A particularly preferred polyol is SynFac 8008 brand. The modification of the polyepoxide, that is, the chain extension and corresponding increase of molecular weight, is accomplished by mixing the organic polyol with the polyepoxide in an organic solvent, such as toluene, methyl isobutyl ketone xylene, etc., and reacting these products at a sufficient temperature for a sufficient amount of time in a conventional reactor in the presence of a catalyst to completely react the polyepoxide. Typically, the reaction temperature will be 93 C 200 F to 177 C 350 F , more typically 121 C 250 F to 160 C 320 F , preferably 127 C 260 F to 149 C 300 F .

These polyamines can be aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic and contain at least 2 carbon atoms per molecule. Useful polyamines contain 2 to 6 amine nitrogen atoms per molecule, 3 to 8 amine hydrogen atoms and 2 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of such amines are the alkylene polyamines, ethylene diamine, wherein n is an integer of 0 to 4 and R is an alkylene group containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples of such alkylene polyamines are ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, pentaethylene hexamine, dipropylene triamine, tributylene tetramine and the like. Mixtures of amines can also be used. The more preferred amines are the ethylene polyamines with the most preferred being triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, and diethylene triamine. Sufficient quantities of polyamine are reacted with sufficient quantities of modified polyepoxide resin so that the adduct formed contains about 1 mole of adducted polyamine molecule for each epoxide equivalent originally present in polyepoxide resin. The adducting reaction typically requires 1.5 to 15.0 moles of polyamine, i.e., an excess, for each epoxide equivalent of the polyepoxide resin, more typically 2.0 moles to 12.0 moles, and preferably 3.0 moles to 10.0 moles. Since excess polyamine is used, the excess unreacted polyamine must be removed by distillation after reaction to prevent gellation of the reaction product. In preparing the modified epoxy polyamine compositions sufficient quantities of polyamine are reacted with sufficient quantities of modified polyepoxide resin in a conventional reactor vessel for a sufficient period of time at a sufficient temperature to react all of the epoxide groups. Typically, the reaction temperature will be 24 C 75 F to 104 C 220 F , more typically 27 C 80 F to 88 C 190 F , and preferably 60 C 140 F to 82 C 180 F .

Examples of such glycidyl esters are those derived from 9 to 19 carbon atoms, particularly Versatic 911 Acid, a product of Shell Oil Company, which acid contains 9 to 11 carbon atoms. The monoepoxides or fatty acids are optionally reacted with the modified epoxy polyamine adducts of this invention to improve the electrical insulating properties of the deposited electrodepositable resin compositions of this invention.

The blocked polyisocyanates of this invention are mixed with the epoxy resin compositions, preferably the optionally modified epoxy polyamine fatty acid or epoxy polyamine monoepoxide reaction products, by adding the blocked polyisocyanates to a reactor containing the epoxy resin composition and mixing the charge for about one half hour. In order to solubilize an amine containing epoxy resin composition, it is necessary to salt the reaction product with a water soluble acid. The acids which can be used include those known in the art such as formic acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, etc. Sufficient quantities of the acid are mixed with said amine containing epoxy resin compositions to solubilize or disperse the resin in water. One method in which the salting process is accomplished is by charging the amine containing epoxy resin composition, an acid, cosolvents, water and surfactants conventional in the art into a reactor vessel, and mixing the reactor charge with a slow speed mixer until the reaction has been completed. In a preferred method, acid, water, etc. are initially added to a reactor vessel, then the resin is charged while the reactants are mixed with a slow speed mixer.

The cathodic electrodepositable coating baths of this invention are typically formed by mixing the solubilized i.e., salted cathodic electrodepositable resin compositions of this invention in concentrate form with water, although dry resin could be used. The electrodeposition bath may contain additional ingredients such as pigments, cosolvents, antioxidants, surfactants, etc., which are typically used in electrodeposition processes known in the art. Pigment compositions may be of any conventional type and are one or more of such pigments as the iron oxides, the lead oxides, strontium chromate, carbon black, titanium dioxide, talc, barium sulphite, barium yellow, cadmium red, chromic green, lead silicate, etc. Sufficient quantities of pigment are used to achieve the appearance characteristics desired such as gloss, reflectance, hue tint and other desired characteristics. Typically, the amount of pigment used is expressed in a ratio of total pigment to total binder. Typically a pigment to binder ratio of 0.1 to 0.4 is used in the electrodepositable resin compositions of the present invention, more typically 0.15 to 0.35, preferably 0.2 to 0.3. Pigment is typically added to the electrodeposition bath in paste form, i.e., predispersed in a composition comprising pigment, amine containing epoxy resin, and surfactants. The electrodeposition baths may contain coupling solvents which are water soluble or partially water soluble organic solvents for the resinous vehicles used in the practice of this invention. The coupling solvents or cosolvents used in the practice of this invention are those typically used and known in the art. Examples of such coupling solvents include monomethyl ether ethylene glycol, monoethyl ether ethylene glycol, monobutylether, diethylene glycol monobutylether, ethanol, isopropanol, n butenol, etc. Sufficient amounts of coupling solvent are used so that a good emulsion resulting in a smooth deposited film is produced. Typically, the amount of coupling solvent used will be 0.5 wt. to 10 wt. of the total weight of the coating bath, more typically 1 wt. to 5 wt. , and preferably 1 wt. to 2 wt. . The electrodeposition process typically takes place in an electrically insulated tank containing an electrically conductive anode which is attached to a direct current source. The size of the tank will depend on the size of the article to be coated. Typically, the tank is constructed of stainless steel or mild steel lined with a dielectric coating such as epoxy impregnated fiberglass or polypropylene. The electrodepositable cathodic resinous coating compositions of this invention are typically used to coat articles such as automobile or truck bodies. The typical size of an electrodeposition bath tank used for this purpose is 227000ℓ 60,000 gallons to 454000ℓ 120,000 gallons . Typically, the article to be coated is connected to the direct current circuit so that the conductive object acts as the cathode. When the article is immersed in the coating bath, flow of electrons from the cathode to the anode, that is, conventional current flow from the anode to the cathode, results in the particles of the dispersed cationic electrodepositable resin composition being deposited on the surfaces of the article. The particles of the dispersed resin composition are positively charged and are therefore attracted to the negative cathodic surface of the object to be coated. The thickness of coating deposited upon the object during its residence in the electric cathodic coating bath is a function of the cathodic electrodepositable resin composition, the voltage across the article, the current flux, the pH of the coating bath, the conductivity, the residence time, etc. Sufficient voltage will be applied to the coated article for a sufficient time to obtain a coating of sufficient thickness. Typically, the voltage applied across the coated article is 50 volts to 500 volts, more typically 200 to 350 volts, and preferably 225 volts to 300 volts. The current density is typically 5.5 A m² 0.5 ampere per sq. ft. to 337 A m² 30 amperes per sq. ft. , more typically 11.1 A m² one ampere per sq. ft. to 277 A m² 25 amperes per sq. ft. , and preferably 11.1 A m² one ampere per sq. ft . The article to be coated typically remains in the coating bath for a sufficient period of time to produce a coating or film of sufficient thickness, having sufficient resistance to corrosion and flexibility. The residence time or holding time is typically 1 minute to 3 minutes, more typically 1 minute to 2 1 2 minutes, and preferably 2 minutes. The pH of the coating bath is sufficient to produce a coating which will not rupture under the applied voltage. That is, sufficient PH to maintain the stability of the coating bath so that the resin does not kick out of the dispersed state and to control the conductivity of the bath. Typically, the pH is 4 to 7 more typically 5 to 6.8, and preferably 6 to 6.5. The conductivity of the coating bath will be sufficient to produce a coated film of sufficient thickness. Typically the conductivity will be 800 micro mhos to 3,000 micro mhos, more typically 800 micro mhos to 2,200 micro mhos, and preferably 900 micro mhos to 1,800 micro mhos. The desirable coating thicknesses are sufficient to provide resistance to corrosion while having adequate flexibility. Typically, the film thicknesses of the coated objects of this invention will be 10.1µm 0.4 mil to 45.7µm 1.8 mils , more typically 15.2µm 0.6 mil to 40.6µm 1.6 mils , and preferably 30.5µm 1.2 mils to 35.6µm 1.4 mils . The temperature of the coating bath is preferably maintained through cooling at a temperature less than 30 C 86 F . When the desired thickness of the coating has been achieved the coated object is removed from the electrodeposition bath and cured. Typically, the electrodeposited coatings are cured in a conventional convection oven at a sufficient temperature for a sufficient length of time to unblock the blocked polyisocyanates and allow for cross linking of the electrodepositable resin compositions. Typically, the coated articles will be baked at a temperature of 93 C 200 F to 316 C 600 F , more typically 121 C 250 F to 143 C 290 F , and preferably 107 C 225 F to 135 C 275 F . The coated articles will be baked for a time period of 10 minutes to 40 minutes, more typically ten minutes to 35 minutes, and preferably 15 minutes to 30 minutes. It is contemplated that the coated articles of the present invention may also be cured by using radiation, vapor curing, contact with heat transfer fluids, and equivalent methods. The smoothness of the cured coating is a function of the flow of the deposited coating composition. Flow is defined as the tendency of the electrodeposited coating composition to liquify during the curing operation and form a smooth cohesive film over the surface of a coated article prior to the onset cross linking. Typically the coated articles of this invention will comprise conductive substrates such as metal, including steel, aluminum, copper, etc., however, any conductive substrate having a conductivity similar to the aforementioned metals may be used. The articles to be coated may comprise any shape so long as all surfaces can be wetted by the electrodeposition bath. The characteristics of the article to be coated which have an effect on the coating include the shape of the article, the capacity of the surfaces to be wetted by the coating solution, and the degree of shielding from the anode. Shielding is defined as the degree of interference with the electromotive field produced between the cathode and the anode, thereby preventing the coating composition from being deposited in those shielded areas. A measure of the ability of the coating bath to coat remote areas of the object is throwpower. Throwpower is a function of the electrical configuration of the anode and cathode as well as the conductivity of the electrodeposition bath. The coatings of the coated articles of this invention exhibit superior smoothness, gloss, flexibility, durability, and resistance to corrosion. Smoothness and gloss are related to the flow of the electrodeposited cathodic resin. Durability, flexibility and resistance to corrosion are related to the chemical nature of the electrodeposited cathodic resin as well as the smoothness of the deposited coating. These coating compositions readily accept an automotive primer overcoat. It should be noted that the articles which are coated by the coating compositions of this invention are typically automobile bodies which have been pretreated to remove impurities and contaminants in a phosphotizing bath. The following example is illustrative of the principles and practice of this invention, although not limited thereto. Parts and percentages where used are parts and percentages by weight.
