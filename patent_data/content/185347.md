# Method for production of stable nicorandil preparation.

## Abstract
A method for producing a stable pharmaceutical prepa ration containing nicorandil as an active ingredient is disclosed. The stable preparation is produced by mixing nicorandil, one or more finely comminuted sugars, and or one or more powdery organic acids. Nicorandil which is useful as a curative for various types of angina pectoris is not stable against the compressive pressure exerted by punching operations in tablet making or against moisture. The preparation of nicorandil manufactured by this invention is very stable and useful in clinical applications.
