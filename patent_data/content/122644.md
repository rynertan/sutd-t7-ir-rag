## Description
METAL HYDRIDE MODIFIED ALUMINIUM AND OR SILICON OXIDE COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION Aluminas, silicas and alumino silicas find frequent use as catalysts and as supports for catalyst metals, particularly as supports for syngas catalysts. The support itself can in many instances modify the catalyzed reaction. Modifications of the support can thus effect the catalyst activity and selectivity as well as change the product mix. Various means have been utilized to add modifiers to supports. A frequently used method is to impregnate the support with dissolved salt or compound and then calcine the impregnated material. There have now been found aluminas, and silicas with quite different chemical and physical characteristics. This invention relates to a process for preparing an aluminium oxide and or silicon oxide gel composition having bonded thereto magnesium oxide, barium oxide or zirconium oxide characterized in that a substantially anhydrous aluminium and or silicon oxide gel is contacted with powdered magnesium hydride, barium hydride or zirconium hydride in a slurry phase with the slurrying medium being an anhydrous, non hydroxyl containing organic liquid whereby the hydride reacts with the said gel, and subsequently the gel is dried to remove the organic liquid.Preferably the amount of magnesium hydride, barium hydride or zirconium hydride utilized is not greater than the amount needed to completely react with hydroxyl moieties present in the gel.After contact and reaction with the hydride, and after being dried to remove the solvent the gel may be calcined at elevated temperatures. An aluminium and or silicon oxide gel contains chemically bound water in the form of hydroxyl groups. Upon calcination at sufficiently elevated temperatures, water is given off and the gel is converted to the oxide with two hydroxyl moieties giving one molecule of water and an oxygen is attached to a metal ion. Prior to use the oxide gels should be substantially free of absorbed water. The absorbed or free water is removed by heating the gels at temperatures ranging from 100 C to 900 C prior to contact with the hydride. Any environment that provides for drying is suitable such as air, vacuum, inert gas such as nitrogen, etc.The dried gels should be kept away from a humid atmosphere after drying. It is understood that a dried gel will still contain chemically bound water in the form of hydroxide and hydroxy oxide. An aluminium oxide gel is one of the substrates. This alumina can be any of the variety of available aluminas. These are commercially available as alumina gels, activated aluminas or gamma aluminas. Regarding purity of the alumina, it may be stated that s nall amounts of impurities are not generally detrimental. Silica gel is also another substrate. These are readily available commercially and are essentially substantially dehydrated amorphous silica. These materials are available in various density grades, from low density with surface areas ranging from about 100 200 mÃª g to regular density with surface areas up to 800 m Ig. The commercially available materials are used as dessicants, selective absorbents, catalysts and catalyst supports. Regarding purity of the silica, it may be stated that small amounts of impurities are not generally detrimental. Other substrates are the alumino silicates. These materials contain various mixtures of aluminium and silicon oxides. They are readily available commerically and are generally employed as cracking catalysts, Typically they contain from 50 to 95, preferably from 70 to 90 percent by weight of silica. These materials can be prepared in a conventional fashion, as for example by co precipitation, co gellation, or by spray drying. In general, the compositions of the invention are prepared by contacting the substrate with magnesium hydride, barium hydride or zirconium hydride in a slurry phase and allowing the hydride to react with the substrate, which reaction is evidenced by the evolution of hydrogen gas. The temperature of contact is not critical and is generally made at room temperature, although higher or lower temperatures are not precluded. In general contact temperatures of 0 OC to 100 OC are utilized. After reaction, the magnesium barium or zirconium is present in and on the alumina and or silica gel in the form of an oxide although the exact form of the oxide is not known. The magnesium hydride used to prepare the slurry is readily available commercially. It can be prepared in various ways. It has been prepared by lithium aluminium hydride reduction of magnesium compounds and by pyrolysis of alkyl magnesiums. A preferred commercial method of preparation is by synthesis from the elements using special ball milling techniques to provide a continuous fresh surface and careful control of temperatures of hydrogen pressure. The barium hydride used to prepare the slurry is prepared commercially by the direct reaction of the metal and hydrogen at 300 OC. The reaction is highly exothermic and goes to completion rapidly. The zirconium hydride used to prepare the slurry is readily available commercially. It can be prepared either through direct hydriding or by reduction of zirconium oxide with calcium hydride in a hydrogen atmosphere. To prepare the slurry, the hydride is ground to a fine powder, for example, less than 60, preferably less than 100 mesh and then mixed with an anhydrous, non hydroxyl containing organic solvent. Both water and hydroxylic materials react with the hydride and therefore contact with water, and other hydroxylcontaining materials should be avoided. However, once the compositions are prepared by reaction with the hydride, they are no longer sensitive to water and to other hydroxyl containing materials. The inert solvent used to prepare the slurry of hydride should be a solvent that is inert to the hydride. Suitable solvents include alkanes such as hexane, cyclohexane, heptane or dodecane, ethers, such as dimethyl ether, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, and ketones such as dimethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone or methylethyl ketone. In general, an amount of hydride is used to react with the substrate in an amount that does exceed that amount that is needed to completely react with the hydroxyl moieties present in the oxide gel substrate, i.e., an excess of hydride is not used, although lesser amounts than necessary to completely react with the substrate are frequently used. If an amount of hydride greater than that needed to completely react with the hydroxyl moieties present in the substrate is utilized, then upon completion of the reaction, excess hydride would be left on the substrate. This free 1 hydride would be converted to the oxide or hydroxide upon contact with hydroxyl containing materials or by calcination in air at elevated temperatures, but would be in a different form from the oxide prepared by the reaction of the hydride with the substrate.Thus, the use of excess hydride would provide a composition according to the invention which would also contain free i.e., unreacted with the substrate hydride, hydroxide or oxide. In general, the composition of the invention will contain from 0.001 to 50, preferably from 0.01 to 25 and most preferably from 0.1 to 10 percent by weight of magnesium, barium or zirconium, measured as the metal. In a preferred embodiment, the compositions are prepared by adding powdered hydride to a slurry of gel particles under dry box conditions. Alternatively, the gel particles can be added to a slurry of hydride powder. The resultant mixture is stirred until reaction has ceased as indicated by the cessation of hydrogen evolution. After reaction, the compositions are filtered and dried to remove the solvent. Optionally, the compositions are frequently calcined at tempera ures ranging from 200 OC to 900 C prior to use as catalysts or catalyst supports. The compositions of the invention can be utilized as catalysts and as catalyst supports. The magnesium, barium or zirconium modified materials have different physical and chemical properties than the unmodified materials or materials modified using other magnesium, barium or zirconium compounds. For example, the compositions have physical characteristics and properties that differ from those materials prepared for example, by impregnating substrates with magnesium, barium or zirconium nitrate and calcining. Three samples, comprising magnesium on alumina were prepared in order to demonstrate the difference. Sample 1 was prepared according to the invention, as described in Example I. Sample 2 was also prepared according to the invention as described inExample I, but was subsequently calcined at elevated temperature.Sample 3 was prepared by impregnating alumina with an aqueous solution of magnesium nitrate, drying and calcining the resultant material at elevated temperatures similar to those of Sample 2.X Ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS was used to determine the surface distribution of magnesium on the surface of the samples.The samples were prepared for analysis by grinding in an argon atmosphere, followed by mounting on polymer tape. The XPS spectra were recorded on a Varian IEE spectrometer. The relative number of atoms seen on the surface of the compositions using X Ray photoelectric spectroscopy was determined from the core level spectra for the is level of magnesium and the 2s level of aluminium. Table 1 shows the results are the ratios of the relative intensities of the magnesium s is element line to the aluminium s 2s element line.

To illustrate the different physical characteristics, a composition of the invention comprising barium on silica and a comparative composition prepared by impregnating silica gel with an aqueous solution of barium nitrate and subsequently calcining, were analyzed using X Ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS . The samples were prepared for analyses by grinding in an argon atmosphere, followed by mounting on polymer tape. The XPS spectra were recorded in a Varian IEE spectrometer. The relative number of atoms seen on the surface of the compositions using X Ray photoelectron spectroscopy was determined from the core level spectra for the 3d and 4d levels of barium, the 2p level of silica and the is level of oxygen and are shown in Table 2.

To illustrate the different physical characteristics, a composition of the invention comprising zirconium on silica and a comparative composition prepared by impregnating silica gel with an aqueous solution of zirconium nitrate and subsequently calcining were analyzed using X Ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS .The samples were prepared for analysis by grinding in an argon atmosphere, followed by mounting on polymer tape. The XPS spectra were recorded on a Varian IEE Spectrometer. The relative number of atoms seen on the surface of the compositions was determined from core level spectra for the 3d level of zirconium, the 2p level of silica and the 1s level of oxygen and are shown in Table 3.

In a dry box, magnesium hydride powder 0.82 g more than about 150 micron was added with stirring to a slurry of calcinedKaiser KA 201 Alumina 33g 590 840 from, 20 30 mesh in dry tetra hydrofuran 80 ml . Stirring was continued for a period of 2 days in a sealed vessel. At the end of the 2 day period the flask was opened and the tetrahydrofuran was allowed to evaporate. The resultant composition contained about 2.5 wt magnesium measured as the metal. A similar composition was prepared using the technique described above and Davison Grade 57 Silica instead of alumina.Utilization of Composition as Catalyst Support A sample of a magnesia silica composition prepared as described above was dried under high vacuum and pelletized to 590 840 um size. The composition 2.6 g, 9 ml was impregnated with a solution of ruthenium trichloride in water 0.5 g of ruthenium salt containing 47.5 ruthenium on the support. The impregnated support was calcined in a quartz tube by heating to 250 OC under nitrogen gas flow 500 ml min for 4 hours. The calcined catalyst was transferred to a 1.4 cm ID highpressure 316 stainless steel tubular reactor. Silicon carbide chips 15 ml each were used above and below the catalyst to support it in the centre of the reactor. The catalyst was reduced by hydrogen at 63 barg and a flow of 500 ml min by heating the reactor over a 2 hour period to 450 C and holding at 450 0C for an additional 2 hour period. The reactor was allowed to cool to room temperature and carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a 1 1 molar ratio was passed over the catalyst at 500 ml min GHSV about 3000 . The reactor was then heated to the desired temperature. The weight of methane in the product was determined and is plotted in Figure 1 as Curve A as a function of temperature. In the Figure is plotted on the vertical axis the weight percentage of methane and on the horizontal axis the temperature in degrees C. The same applies to Figures 2 and 3. A ruthenium catalyst was made as described above but using as a support Davison Grade 57 Silica which had been impregnated with an aqueous solution of magnesium nitrate and subsequently calcined. This catalyst was tested as above and the results are shown in Figure 1 as Curve B. The above was repeated using as a support untreated DavisonGrade 57 Silica. The results are shown as Curve C in Figure 1. As can be seen from Figure 1 the composition of the invention when used as supports provide different catalytic responses as a function of temperature than do untreated silica and silica impregnated with magnesium nitrate and subsequently calcined.EXAMPLE II This example illustrates the preparation of the barium modified composition according to the invention. In a dry box, barium hydride powder 0.5 g more than about 150 micron was added with stirring to a slurry of calcined KaiserKA 201 Alumina 9.5 g, 590 840 pm, 20 30 mesh in dry tetrahydrofuran 20 ml . Stirring was continued for a period of 2 days in a sealed vessel. At the end of the 2 day period the flask was opened and the tetrahydrofuran was allowed to evaporate. The resultant composition contained about 5.3 wt barium measured as the metal. A similar composition was prepared using the technique described above and Davison Grade 57 Silica instead of alumina.Utilization of Composition as Catalyst Support A sample of a barium modified silica composition 20 wt BA prepared as described above was dried under high vacuum and pelletized to 590 840 pm size. The composition 5.7 g, 9 ml was impregnated with a solution of ruthenium trichloride in water 1.04 g of RuC13.XH20 in 7 ml deionized water . This gave about 8.9 Xwt ruthenium on the support. The impregnated support was calcined in a quartz tube by heating to 250 OC under nitrogen gas flow 500 ml min for 4 hours. The calcined catalyst was transferred to a 1.4 cm ID high pressure 316 stainless steel tubular reactor. Silicon carbide chips 18 ml each were used above and below the catalyst to support it in the centre of the reactor. The catalyst was reduced by hydrogen at 63 barg and a flow of 500 ml min by heating the reactor over a 2 hour period to 450 C and holding at 450 OC for an additional 2 hour period. The reactor was allowed to cool to room temperature and carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a 1 1 molar ratio was passed over the catalyst at 500 ml min GHSV about 3000 . The reactor was then heated to the desired temperature. The weight of methane in the product was determined and is plotted in Figure 2 as Curve A as a function of temperature. The above was repeated using as a support untreated DavisonGrade 57 Silica. The results are shown as Curve B in Figure 2. As can be seen from Figure 2 the compositions of the invention when used as supports provide different catalytic responses as a function of temperature than do unmodified silica. The products formed by the above reactions were analyzed for paraffins and olefins by gas chromatography to provide a relatively quantitative measure of olefin isomerization. An isomerization equivalent is determined from the GC results. This involves the ratio of paraffin to olefin peak heights. As more isomerization occurs, the peak height ratio increases. This needs to be corrected, however, for the relative amounts of the olefins compared to the paraffins. This can be done by multiplying the paraffin to olefin peak height ratio by the olefin to paraffin peak area ratio. This method does not take into account the relative response factors, peak half widths, etc. However, with no isomerization occurring, the isomerization equivalent should be near one.With isomerization occurring, the number should be greater than cne. The isomerization equivalents calculated for the various catalysts are tabulated in Table 4, These numbers de.onstrate the remazable effect the barium has on stopping the olefin somerization.

In a dry box, zirconium hydride powder 0.1 g more than about 150 micron was added with stirring to a slurry of calcinedKaiser KA 201 Alumina 1.9g, 590 840 pm, 20 30 mesh in dry tetrahydrofuran 50 ml . Stirring was continued for a period of 2 days in a sealed vessel. At the end of the 2 day period the flask was opened and the tetrahydrofuran was allowed to evaporate. The resultant composition contained about 5 7owt zirconium measured as the metal. A similar composition was prepared using the technique described above and Davison Grade 57 Silica instead of alumina.Utilication of Composition as Catalyst Support A sample of a zirconia silica composition prepared as described above containing about 10 V owt of zirconium metal was dried under high vacuum and pelletized to 590 840 pm size. The composition 5.6 g, 9 ml was impregnated with a solution of ruthenium trichloride in water 1.9 g RuC13.XH20 in 9 ml of deionized water . This gave about 8.9 wt ruthenium on the support. The impregnated support was calcined in a quartz tube by heating to 250 C under nitrogen gas flow 500 ml min for 4 hours. The calcined catalyst was transferred to a 1.4 cm ID highpressure 316 stainless steel tubular reactor. Silicon carbide chips 15 ml each were used above and below the catalyst to support it in the centre of the reactor. The catalyst was reduced by hydrogen at 63 barg and a flow of 500 ml min by heating the reactor over a a 2 hour period to 450 OC and holding at 450 OC for an additional 2 hour period. The reactor was allowed to cool to room temperature and carbon monoxide and hydrogen in a 1 1 molar ratio was passed over the catalyst at 500 ml min GHSV about 300 . The reactor was then heated to the desired temperature. The weight of methane in the product was determined and plotted in Figure 3 as Curve A as a function of temperature. The above was repeated using as a support untreated DavisonGrade 57 Silica. The results are shown as Curve B in Figure 3. As can be seen from Figure 3 the compositions of the invention when used as supports provide different catalytic responses as a function of temperature than do unmodified silica.
