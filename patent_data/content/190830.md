# SINGLE OPTICAL FIBER SENSOR FOR MEASURING THE PARTIAL PRESSURE OF OXYGEN

## Abstract
A device is described for sensing oxygen, particularly for use in medical applications. The device includes a plastic optical waveguide having a cladding and a core. A portion of the core is exposed, plasticized, and a fluorescent, oxygen sensitive dye is integrated in the exposed core. The oxygen sensitive dye fluoresces in response to light from a light source such that the intensity of fluorescence is dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment.
