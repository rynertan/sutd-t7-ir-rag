# Process for measuring endotoxin.

## Abstract
Endotoxin contents in samples can be determined qualitatively or quantitatively, singly or in parallel, with high precision in a short time by a process comprising applying a light to each sample solution, measuring an initial transmit ted light amount I₀ and a transmitted light amount at a time t, I t , to give a ratio R t I t I₀, and judging a gelation point by a threshold value of R t , or further obtaining a gelation time from the gelation point. An apparatus used therefor is also disclosed.
