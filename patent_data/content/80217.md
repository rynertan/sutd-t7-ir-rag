## Description
Fixing coils by means of parylene, fixed coils The invention relates to a coil the winding wires of which have been fixed by means of an adhesive and to a method of fixing coils by means of an adhesive. Coils are used, for example, in motors or as deflection coils in cathode ray tubes and in camera tubes for television cameras and the like. Such coils are constructed from a winding wire which is wound according to a given pattern. The pattern determines the electromagnetic properties of the coil. United States Patent Specification 2,395,736 discloses a method of fixing the winding wires of coils in which method the coils are impregnated with a resin.This method has for its result that the outside dimensions of the coils vary for each individual coil. Upon assembling the coils this may present problems. According to Netherlands Patent Application 7,412,209 the winding wire for coils is a wire which has a first electrically insulating envelope about which a second envelope has been provided. This second envelope usually consists of a thermoplastic synthetic resin. Said second envelope serves to bond the winding wires together as soon as they have been wound to a given pattern and to thus fix the winding wires. Most thermoplastic resins soften already at a comparatively temperature. This has for its result that the winding wires of the coil are no longer sufficiently fixed when the temperature rises and deform as a result of internal stresses built up during winding. In order to solve this problem, Netherlards patent Application 7 412 209 suggests the use of special sjl1tlaetic resins for the second envelope. The invention provides a different solution to this problem. The coils according to the invention are characterized in that the winding wires are fixed with more than one adhesive, at least one of the adhesives being a poly p xylylene or a derivative thereof. A method according to the invention of fixing coils is characterized in that the coils are first fixed with one or more adhesives according to a known method and a layer of poly p xylylene or a derivative thereof is then provided on the coils. The coils according to the invention maintain their shape when, for example, they are exposed to an alternating temperature test from 25 to 75be or when they are brought to 750C or 250C. The Figure shows a suitable embodiment of a coil according to the invention. The coils according to the invention have a poly p xylylene layer in a thickness of usually less than 10 micrometres, preferably from 1 5 micrometres. Poly p xylylene or a derivative thereof is to be understood to include herein all compounds of this type as described in United States Patent Specifications 3,246,627, 3,288,728 and 3,342,754. These Patent Specifications, as well as United States Patent Specification 4,173,664, describe how poly p xylylene can be provided. These fourUnited States Patent Specifications are demmed to be incorporated in this Application by reference. Up till now poly p xylylene has mainly been used due to its favourable electrically insulating properties.In the coils according to the invention these insulating properties are not used as a matter of fact the winding wire from which the coils according to the invention have been manufactured is a known winding wire which already has an insulating envelope. In the coils according to the invention the properties of poly p xylylene as an adhesive are used. It has been found that poly p xylylene keeps good adhesive properties in the case of temperature changes between 250C and 75 0C. Adhesion is to be understood to mean in this connection that the poly p xylylene serves as an embedding mass in which the winding wires are embedded so as to be substantially immovable. Poly p xylylene is provided in the vapour phase in a monomeric state in a radical form . It then condenses and polymerises. It is supposed that the monomeric form penetrates between the winding wires of the coil and deposits not only on the outer surface of the coil but also between the winding wires of the coil. In connection with the favourable penetration properties of the monomeric precursor of p xylylene itself, poly p xylylene is to be preferred. An embodiment of the invention has been shown in the drawings, in which fig. 1 represents a complete coil fig. 2 shows a cross section of the coil according to fig. 1 along lines A A and fig. 3 shows enlarged part B of fig. 2. In fig. 1 has been shown a complete coil according to the invention comprising fixed winding wires 1.Fig. 2 shows the coil according to the invention in cross section A A of fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows in enlargement part B of fig. 2. By way of example only four arrays of fixed winding wires have been shown. In fig. 3 one can see the separate winding wires consisting of a metal core 2 and an insulating envelope 3 . Insulating envelope 3 comprises a first insulating envelope of polyurethane and a second thermoplastic envelope of polyvinylbutyral. Envelopes 3 touch one another and provide some fixing of the winding coils. In between the fixing coils one sees a mass of polyvinylbutyral giving a further adhesion between the winding wires. The invention will now be described with reference to an example which describes the manufacture of a given type of coil. A winding wire is used which is coated with a thermoplastic material, namely with polyvinyl ,1tyral. This material loses its adhesive force partly at tempera ture fluctuations between 250C and 750C. When poly pxylylene or a derivative thereof is provided on the coil, the coil does not apprecially deform in the case of such temperature fluctuations. However, the invention is by no means restricted to coils having winding wires which are coated with polyvinyl butyral. The invention provides the provision of poly p xylylene in all those cases in which the thermoplastic material or other material used for fixing the winding wire does not adhere sufficiently at elevated or reduced temperatures to prevent deformation of the coil.Example. Ten coils as shown in the Figure were manufactured by means of conventional winding wire. The winding wire consisted of a copper wire having a first insulating envelope of polyurethane and a second thermoplastic envelope of polyvinyl butyral. The thickness of the wire including the two envelopes was approximately 0.25 mm. Five wires were simultaneously wound in one plane according to a rectangular pattern. The resulting rectangle was then bent in a jig with a radius of curvature of approximately 17 mm.Simultaneously a current was passed through the winding wire so as to raise the temperature of the coil to approxi 0 mately 70 C. The thermoplastic envelope softened. The coils were cooled in the jig. In this manner, known coils as shown in the Figure were obtained. Five out of the ten coils Nos. 1 5 were further treated in order to obtain coils according to the invention. These five coils were introduced into a device the principle of which is described in the above mentionedUnited States Patent Specification 3,246,627. In this device a layer of poly p xylylene was provided on the five coils in a layer thickness of 2.5 micrometres. All ten coils were then subjected to an alternating temperature test consisting of five cycles of each 1 hour at 75 0C plus 1 hour at 250C. Prior to and after the test the length of the coils was measured at room temperature. The results obtains are recorded in the table below. Coils No. Length in mm Difference in length prior to after in mm the test the test 1 64.85 65.15 0.3 2 64.8 65.15 0.35 3 64.9 65.1 0.2 4 64.95 65.25 0.3 5 64.9 65.1 0.2Average Nos. 1 to 5 0.27 6 64.95 65.8 0.85 7 64.9 65.6 0.7 8 64.85 65.5 0.65 9 65 65.7 0.7 10 64.9 65.75 0.85Average Nos. 6 to 10 0.75 It may be seen from the table that the coils 6 to 10 which are not coated with poly p xylylene showed an average change in their length of 0.75 mm while the coils 1 to 5, which have been provided with a second adhesive poly p xylylene according to the invention showed the same type of change of only 0.27 mm. This means that the shape of the coils according to the invention is more stable in the case of temperature fluctuations as they occur in practical use. Consequently the electromagnetic field of the coils according to the invention in the case of temperature fluctuations is more constant in nature than in the known coils. A similar effect occurs when the coils are not subjected to temperature fluctuations but are heated once to, for example, 750C.
