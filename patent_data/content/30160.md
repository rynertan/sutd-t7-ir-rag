# Interactive user machine interface method and apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a user interface device UI device used for machine control. The UI device is comprised a video display 124 capable of presenting desired images to the machine operator and a touch sensitive device 125 capable of detecting operator requests by means of the operator touching the surface of the video display 124 . A standard keyboard 126 may also be employed when typed responses are required of the operator, or a QWERTY keyboard may be displayed on the display 124. The UI device is controlled by a general purpose computer 101 which also controls the on line machine 102 . Visual elements presented to the user on the UI device s display 124 include instructions in text orthographic display , and images imaginal display . Displayed images may include and log status indicators eg, meters, thermometers and buttons which the operator can touch to signal control requests. The displayed images change dynamically, so that only relevant indicators and valid control buttons are presented to the user at any given time termed conditional disclosure , and the display format can be changed completely upon operator request, to allow for control of infrequently used or complex features termed progressive disclosure . A set of schematics and flow charts are included to complete the disclosure of the system. The resultant interactive display enables a relatively untrained operator to control a feature rich or complex system.

## Description
iNTERACTIVE USER MACHINE INTERFACE METHOD AND APPARATUS This invention relates to human interfaces for the control of complex machinery, and, more particularly, to computer controlled systems wherein the user can specify a number of operating parameters to control machine operation. Prior art human interfaces arecharacterized by either control panels or keyboard input systems coupled with orthographic text video displays. For complex control processes, the control panel becomes a large area composed of various buttons, knobs, indicator lights, and perhaps meters. This array of elements can be quite baffling to the untrained user, and is thus particularly unsuitable for the control of devices intended for casual usage, such as a copier. The use of a common orthographic video display device or printer mechanism, coupled with a keyboard for user input, requires the user to interface with the computer via a dialoooe whose nature is determined as much by the computer s requirements for input output protocols as by the operational requirements of the machinery being controlled. This type of user interface typically requires that the user learn a set of commands and then type these commands as required to initiate machine operations. As before, the casual user is effectively discouraged from using the system due to the difficulty of learning its control procedures. It would be desirable, therefore, to provide a user interface having the attributes of simplicity so that the casual user would not be discouraged from using the machine while still offering the full extent of control capabilities required by the trained operator in order to extract full operational advantage from the machine. In order to meet these requirements, a user interface device UI device is offered which is capable of simulating a control panel through the mechanisms of imaginal display and touch screen function selection. A bit mapped CRT display is used in conjunction with a computer system and special refresh electronics Ref U. S. Patent 4,103,331 to present the image of a control panel to the user. Buttons displayed in the image are positioned to correspond with coordinate points within an infrared emitter detector diode matrix placed around the periphery of the screen and capable of detecting a touch of the screen by the user s finger or similar. In this manner, the user is able to react to the screen display as if it were an actual panel of buttons.Additionally, orthographic text data appears on the screen to label the buttons and to provide other information as needed, and imaginal picture images are displayed to convey information commonly presented through meters and dials on conventional control panels. The display scenario for a given machine control. application typically consists of multiple distinct display formats termed frames . The initial frame presented to the user controls only the basic functions of the machine, and additionally presents one or more buttons as appropriate to select special features. When the user selects one of the special feature buttons, the basic frame is replaced by a new frame displaying the controls corresponding to that special feature plus a RETURN button used to return to the basic frame after the special control requests have been entered.Further, a special frame can include additional special feature buttons to select still deeper levels of control functions on additional frames. Thus a tree structure is realized wherein the user who requires special features works his way down the branches of the tree i.e., calls up deeper frames to reach whatever level of control his application requires. A principle advantage of this system of progressive disclosure is that the casual user sees only the relatively simple basic frame, and, when additional features are required, only the controls and indicators relevant to the required features are displayed as the necessary additional frames are called up. Individual frames implement a conditional disclosure feature whereby display elements in the form of buttons, indicators or alphanumeric material are removed from the display whenever their functions are not valid to the current state of the process. For example, a tenZdigit touch pad, similar to the ubiquitous telephone touch tone pad, appears on the screen whenever the entry of numerical data is a legitimate user operation and disappears when numerical data are not needed. The system comprises a computer or processor which communicates with the User Interface UI through a set of circuits herein called the User Interface Logic UlL to display to the operator a set of images and messages, and also communicates with the host system to command the system functions received from the User Interface. The present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a block diagram representation of the basic computer controlled machine concept typical of the state of the art Figure 2 is a block diagram representation of the system functions present in the computer controlled system of the present invention Figure 3 is a functional block diagram representation of theMachine Control Task MT , which directly controls the Machine functions Figure 4 is a functional block diagram representation of the UserInterface Control Task UT , which controls interaction with the System User and instructs the Machine Control Task Figure 5 is a functional block diagram representation of the DisplayImage Generator Task DT , which controls the displayed image presented to the System User Figure 6 is a functional block diagram representation of the TouchFunction Decode Task TT , which decodes System User requests from the touch screen or other System User pointing devices Figure 7 is a flow chart representation of the operations performed by the Machine Control Task MT Figure 8 is a flow chart representation of the operations performed by the User Interface Control Task UT Figure 9 is a flow chart representation of the operations performed by the Display Image Generator Task DT Figure 10 is a flow chart representation of the process of updating the Display Screen image Figure 11 is a flow chart representation of the process of adding and removing Screen Elements Figure 12 is a flow chart representation of the operations performed by the Touch Decode Task TT Figure 13 shows the software table structure used to define the various frame formats to the Display Image Generator Task Figure 14 shows the frame displayed to the user when the system is idle the Walking Button Figure 15 shows the frame displayed for control of the basic functions of the copier Figure 16 shows the frame displayed for control of the reduction feature of the copier Figure 17 shows the frame displayed for control of the variable density feature of the copier Figure 18 is a block diagram Ïf circuits required to drive the user interface Figure 19 is a block diagram of the control logic to the computer Figure 20 is a schema of the computer output lines to the control logic unit Figure 21 is a schema of the circuit for moving the horizontal tab Figure 22 is a schema of the data buffer for even line data Figure 23 is a schema of the cursor logic Figure 24 is a schema of the circuit for ORing the cursor and video data Figure 25 is a schema of the CRT controller section Figure 26 is a schema of the local font storage Figure 27 is a schema of the path of the CRT video data Figure 28 is a schema of the page buffer Figures 29 and 30 are complementary schemeta of the touch panel interface, and Figures 31 33 are typical representations of displays available on the interace device when it is desired to change the frame. Referring to Figure 1, a computer controlled machines stem with user interface of the general case is shown. In this common embodiment, the computer system 101 is interfaced to the machine 102 through interface hardware 103 and is programmed to control the machine through one or more computer programs 104 residing in the computer s main memory or in the computer s microcode 105. The user s interface to the computer is typically through a terminal 106, such as a CRT display with keyboard, interfaced to the computer through interface hardware 107. In this implementation, the computer program for the user s interface 108 communicates with the user by displaying output at the display station of the user s terminal 106, and by accepting input commands typed by the user on the terminal s keyboard. The present invention replaces the user s terminal with a complex user interface device Ul device , but the keyboard may be retained to be used by the operator for any purpose. For example, some displays may request information from the operator which may more easily be supplied by a keyboard. Alpha numeric information for instance, would be conveniently enterable by key board. If a keyboard were to be used in conjunction with the display described herein, it would be coupled to the computer or to the display in any well known manner. Figure 2 shows a computer controlled machine system employing the present invention ul device . Functions unique to the UI device are shown in heavy lines to emphasize the area of the invention. The program functions of Machine Control 109, User Interface Control 110, Display Image Generation 111, and Touch Function Decode 112 are Task implementations as described in US Patent 4 103 330. The two main tasl s, User Interface Control 110 and Machine control 109, are finite state machine im plementations, driven from Tables 113 and 114 respectively. The electronic and program functions of the Machine ControlTask 109, the Machine Interface Control Electronics 119, and the Machine itself, 120 a Xerox registered trademark 9400 duplicator for the preferred embodiment , are neither unique implementations nor part of the UI device.However, for completeness of the embodiment these functions are now described. The Machine Control Task 109 and related electronic functions including the Machine 120 and its Interface, are shown in figure 3 and Figure 7. Figure 3 is a block diagram showing the functional relationships between the Machine Control Task MT 109 and the other system elements with which the MT interacts. When the system is started the MT begins executing the processes shown in Figure 7. First, the MT performs the reset function to the Machine via the Machine interface in order to ensure that the Machine state is known and controlled. MT status words in memory are initialized, and the MT is now in its general idle state waiting for instructions from the User Interface Control Task UT 110, or after the Machine is running, for signals interrupts from the Machine via its Interface 109. When a user command or machine interrupt is received, the MT determines the action s to be taken from its control tables 114, and executes the process es and updates its state indicators as appropriate.Significant changes in machine status, as defined in the control tables 114, are signalled back to the UT 110 so that the display can be updated quickly. The present invention is that of the unique user interface Device UI device that has been developed to interface the Machine Control Task 109 with the system user. A block diagram of the UI device functions are shown inFigure 4. Control of the UI device resides in the User Interface Control Task UT 110. Operation of the UI device begins with power on to the system, and results in the UT 110 performing the functions shown in Figure 8. At initialization, the UT 110 initializes its status indicators in memory and sees that the Machine Task 109 is also initialized. If there is a power on sequence, the MT will have initialized itself. If not, the UT will cause the MT to initialize .The UT is table driven from its associated Control Tables 113, and from these tables it determines the initial frame to be presented to the user and signals that frame s identification as an index number to the DisplayImage Generator Task DT 111. The DT will bring up the display frame automatically from this point, and is described separately below. The UT is mw in an idle state, waiting for either operator activity to be signalled from the Touch Function Decode Task TT 112, or possibly from an attached optional keyboard 126 , or for machine state changes to be signalled from theMachine Control Task MT 109, although the latter will only happen after the machine has been started .From this point on, operation is repetitive with user commands arriving from the TT 112, the command being executed by theUT 110 through directions from its control tables 113, and with status words being maintained in the Global Data Base GBD 115 to reflect the state of the system. The UT 110 controls directly the MT 109 and the DT Ill through software service calls, and the rest of the processes indirectly through the indicators it sets in the GDB 115. The Global Data Base GDB 115 is employed to hold the status indicators, switch settings, and system parameters needed to define the software operating states of the system, and to facilitate communication between the various software tasks and processes that make up the programmed functions of the system. The functional organization of the display portion of the Ul device is shown in block diagram format in Figure 5. The Display Image GeneratorTask DT Ill is the main software element driving the display, and its functions are shown in Figure 9, Figure 10, and Figure 11. Referring to the block diagramFigure 5, the User Interface Control Task UT 110 signals the Display ImageGenerator Task DT 111 with the index number of the frame that should be seen by the system user at that point in time. The DT Ill accesses the FrameDefinition tables 116 to discover the makeup of the frame, the makeup being defined in terms of a series of Screen Elements SE to be positioned at various points on the CRT 124.The SE s exist as orthographic data text characters or imaginal data images formed of bit patterns , and are defined to the DT Ill through the Font Definitions 117 for the orthographic characters, and through the Image Definitions 118 for the imaginal images. The DT Ill follows the Frame Definitions 116 to position orthographic and imaginal images on the screen. The actual display of the data is accomplished through creation of a bit image of the desired CRT image, pixel for pixel, into the Display Image area of the system s memory 122.The hardware display process then reads the pixels from memory and modulates the CRT beam as it scans in real time. This display system is patented separately in U.S. Patent 4,103,331. In the creation of the display image by the DT 111, the existence of buttons on the screen for the user to press is particularly important, since the detection of a user touch must subsequently be decoded from an X Y coordinate system used by the touch detect hardware described below to a functional signal for use by the User Interface Control Task 110. The operation of the Touch Function Decode Task in decoding the function from the X Y coordinates of the user s touch is described separately below. To facilitate this decoding, the DT 111 maintains a table in memory of Current Button Definitions 121. When a button s image is formed for screen display, the button s screen coordinates and function are placed into the Current Button Definitions table 121, and when the button is removed from the screen its definition is removed from the table.Because of this, a touch of the screen can quickly be validated as a function request arid the function readily decoded. Referring to Figure 9 The Display Image Generator Task DT Ill initializes by blacking out the display and resetting all indicators, including the button definitions. When a frame select message is received from the UT 110 the DT proceeds to preform an image update process described below which will result in the frame image appearing on the CRT display. The DT is now in its normal idle state, and will respond to certain stimulus conditions. A new frame select from the UT 110 will result in an image update process, which may or may not involve a frame change. A button select from the UT 110 Fig. 5 says that the user has touched a screen button and that the UT is now responding to that button, the usual result being that the DT will reversewideo the button on the screen in order to provide sensory feedback to the user although the Frame Definitions 116 may be set to defeat the reverse video in certain instances . When the touch is removed, or the UT process completed, the UT signals button de select to the DT and the button s image is returned to normal video. Referring to Figure 10, the process of updating the screen image is disclosed. The description of the frame to be displayed is addressed within theFrame Definitions 116, and the frame is then created as shown. The format of the tabled frame definitions are shown in Figure 13. The DT 111 works through the frame descriptor Figure 13 , evaluating the conditional tests when they occur by testing the values of the status indicators in the Global Data Base 115.If the test results in a false indication, the defined elements are skipped. If the test results in a true indication, the defined elements are included in the screen display image in memory. The process of adding and removing screen elements is disclosed inFigure 11. If the element is Font character data its bit image is determined from the Font Definitions 117 Fig. 5 . If the element is an image such as a button , its bit image is determined from the Image Definitions 118. Regardless of whether the image is being added or removed, the element s bit image is exclusive lDRed into the Display Image area of the system s memory. If the element was already present, the exclusive OR process effectively removes it by resetting the bits that had originally defined it. If the element was not already present, the exclusive ORsets the defining bits and the image now appears on the screen.Note that if the element is a button, the CurrentButton Definitions 121 will be updated to reflect the new state of the displayed button set. Referring to Figure 6 User input to the User Interface ControlTask 110 is accomplished normally through the action of the user touching theCRT screen at a point where the Display Image Generator Task Ill has displayed the image of a button. The presence of the user s finger is detected by a two dimensional array of infra red diodes transmitters and detectors .This is the X Y Touch Detector 125, which detects the finger as an X intercept and Y intercept of the infrared beam matrix. The X Y Touch DecodeElectronics 128 report the interception to the Touch Function Decode Task TT 112 as an intercept at an X Y position within the Touch Detector s 125 coordinate system. The TT 112 decodes the X Y intercept to a function request by inspecting table entries in the Current Button Definitions 121. The function requested is then signalled to the User Interface Control Task UT 110 for processing. As a follow on, the UT 110 may then signal the Display ImageGenerator Task DT Ill to reverse video the intercepted button, as described above in the discussion on the operation of the DT 111 . Additionally, the function of the X Y Touch Detector 125 can be circumvented in cases where touching the screen is not appropriate as a user action, or where the operation of the diode matrix would not be reliable for environmental reasons. In these cases, a cursor control device 127 is used to position a cursor image on the screen. The cursor can then be moved by moving the cursor control 127 to select the button functions. The X Y TouchDecode Electronics unit 128 serves as the cursor control interface, and operates in the same manner as described above with respect to button select identification from the Current Button Definitions 121. Operation of the Touch Function Decode Task TT 112 is shown inFigure 12. At initialization, the TT 112 resets its status indicators and then waits for the X Y Touch Decode Electronics unit 128 to signal the X Y coordinates of a screen touch. When a touch coordinate is received, the TT 112 inspects the Current Button Definitions 121 to identify the button touched. If no button is registered as belonging to the touch coördinates, the TT 112 waits for the touch to be removed and then re enters its idle state. If a valid button definition is identified as belonging to the touch coördinates, the TT 112 signals the event to the User Interface Control Task UT 110. When the button is deselected touch removed , that event is also signalled to the UT 110, and the TT 112 then re enters its idle state. Figures 14,14,15, 16,and 17 show the four frames used by the Ul device for control of the Xerox 9400 duplicator. Figure 14 shows the walking button frame. This frame is displayed when the system is idle, and consists of a single button labeled Touch to Begin 150. The screen background is dark, and the button itself continuously moves in small steps across the screen. The walking button frame avoids the event of a bright image remaining on the screen for a long period of time, a benefit since the bright image would eventually result in phosphor burn. The walking button 150 is the only illuminated element on the frame Figure 14 , and since it is constantly moving about on the screen the possibility of phosphor burn is eliminated.When the user wishes to use the machine, he touches this Touch to Begin button 150 and a new frame, shown in Figure 15, appears on the screen. Figure 15 shows the basic user frame. A black bar across the top of the frame 151 displays the word READY , informing the user that the system is ready for use. This message would read NOT READY should that be the case, as when, for example, the copier is waiting for the fuser to reach operating temperature. Simple instructions 152 appear at the top of the frame, and again these can change to reflect immediate requirements. The image of a standard keypad 153 appears at the top left of the frame, and allows the user to enter a copy count by touching the numerical keys in the usual fashion. The count entered is displayed in the window 154 above the keypad, and can be cleared to zero at any time by touching the CLEAR key 155.Buttons controlling system operations, such as the Automatic Document Handler controls 156 and the Sorter controls 157, operate in the usual way of buttons in general, the only modifications being that 1 they are images on the CRT display instead of physical buttons, and 2 when a function is enabled the corresponding button reverse videos and remains that way until the function is reset . The exception to usual copier operation occurs with the buttons labeledASSIST 158, IMAGE REDUCTION 159, and VARIABLE DENSITY 160. These buttons result in new frames replacing the basic frame. The basic frame times out under program control if not used for two minutes, resulting in the reappearance of the walking button frame Figure 14 . Should the user become uncertain of his next step, he can touch the ASSIST button 158 and a frame of instructions will appear to assist him in using the system. A more interesting effect occurs with the IMAGEREDUCTION 159 and VARIABLE DENSITY 160 buttons, since these bring up operational frames as shown in Figures 16 and 17. Referring to Figure 16, touching IMAGE REDUCTION 159 causes this frame to appear so that the user can select the degree of reduction required. The current setting of the reduction hardware is shown at all times on the scale 161 as a percent reduction of the original. The user controls the degree of reduction by touching either of the two buttons 162 163, which result in the reduction hardware moving to increase or decrease the actual reduction effect. The scale pointer 161a is driven in real time to provide instantaneous feedback to the user. When the user is satisfied with the reduction adjustment, he can either return to the basic frame Figure 15 by touching RETURN 164, or go directly to the variable density adjustment by touching VARIABLE DENSITY 165. Note that touching VARIABLE DENSITY on either the basic frame or the reduction frame will cause the variable density frame to appear, i .e., it is not necessary to back up from the reduction frame to the basic frame in order to reach the variable density frame. Referring to Figure 17, operation of the density adjustment is similar to the operation of the reduction adjustment described above. The indicator bar 166 shows the current density setting at all times, and the operator can adjust this setting to any point with the buttons 167 and 168. In addition to the continuous adjustment provided by buttons 167 and 168, three pre set adjustments can be reached instantly by touching the appropriate button LIGHT IMAGE 169, PASTEL PAPER 170, and DARK BACKGROUND 171. When the user is satisfied with the density adjustment, he may directly return to the basic frame by touching RETURN 172, or go directly to the reduction frame by touching IMAGE REDUCTION 173. An additional feature of the system is that the user can perform a limited reconfiguration on the frames to meet the requirements of specific operating environments. For example, in a situation where light originals were a major part of the duplication requirements, it would be inconvenient to have to follow the progressive disclosure process to the variable density frame Fig.17 for virtually every reproduction task. Hence the Change Frame feature has been implemented to allow, for example, the user to duplicate the Light Image button 169 from the variable density frame Fig. 17 onto the basic frame Fig.15 , where it would be directly available to the operator. To activate this feature the user turns a physical control key, called the Function Key, to the Change Frame position. After this is done, the user touches the Touch ToBegin button 150 Fig. 14 , and subsequently receives the first of two frames that control the Change Frame function. The first frame Fig. 31 asks the user to specify whether the function will be moved that is, deleted from one position and placed in another probably, but not necessarily, on a different frame or duplicated i.e., the function will be moved without being deleted from its original position, presumably onto a different frame After selecting Move 180 or Duplicate 181 Fig. 31 , the user keys in the frame number through the keypad 182 of the frame where the function is currently in residence.The user then touches the button whose function he desires to move or duplicate. In the case of a move, the button is deleted from the selected frame at this time. For duplication, the button simply reversevideos to provide optical feedback that it has been selected. The user then touches either Assist or Return to return to the Change Frame control frames both buttons may not appear on all frames,hence either may be used for theReturn function in Change Frame mode . For example, to duplicate the LightImage function 169 Fig. 17 so that it appears on the basic frame Fig. 15 as well as on the variable density frame Fig. 17 , the user would select the variable density frame Fig. 17 as described above, touch the Light Image function button 169 which would reverse video , and then touch Return 172. The second of the two Change Frame control frames Fig. 32 now appears. The user selects the number of the frame onto which the selected function will be deposited. For our example, we wish to move the button to the basic frame Fig. 15 , so this code is entered on the keypad 185. Fig. 32 and the Start button 186 is touched. The selected frame Fig. 15 in the example now appears. To deposit the button on the frame, the user simply touches the frame where he would like to position the button. If the location is valid, the button appears. Specifically, it would be invalid to place a button on top of existing material, and the space selected must be large enough to receive both the button and its associated function label .The button will move across the screen, following the user s touch, as long as the position selected is valid. As the button moves, it is automatically aligned with the infra red touch sense matrix. When the user is satisfied as to button placement, he removes his finger from the screen the button remains and touches the frame s Assist orReturn button the Assist button 158, Fig. 33, is used for this example . For our example, we have duplicated the Light Image button 169 from the variable density frame Fig. 17 to the basic frame Fig. 15 originally, now Fig. 33 , and positioned the new button near the existing Assist button 158 Fig. 33 . Note that since we duplicated the function, as opposed to moving the function, theLight Image button 169 now appears on two distinct frames. That is, the function is still on the variable density frame Fig. 17 , so that frame is functionally complete, and the function is additionally now on the basic frame Fig. 33 for ease of use by the operator. Both Change Frame frames Figs. 31 and 32 contain Cancel buttons 184 and 187. The Cancel buttons allow the user to cancel the move or duplication operations any time prior to selection of the Return button used to signal completion of the operation . If a deletion is cancelled, the operation is simply terminated. If a move is cancelled after the moving button has been selected and thus removed from the source frame , the button is returned to its original frame and original position. The ability to reconfigure frames may be used in the context of defining a button to represent a complete job step or job where the job step or job consists of a sequence of steps already implemented. This is the equivalent of defining a command file type of operation typically implemented in a UCL User Command Language for a computer application. The keyboard may be used to define a label for the newly defined button. Figure 18 is an overall block diagram of the circuits required to drive the User Interface UI 11. The UI 11, which comprises a CRT and the touch panel, is coupled to the computer 10 through an interface which will be referred to as the user interface logic 12 UIL . The computer 10 controls the system, not shown, through any well known means. The User Interface 11 has three major components, the CRT, the touch panel and a power on off switch for the entire system. The CRT is driven by signals typical of any CRT, vertical sync, horizontal sync and video, all of which originate in the UIL 12 as shown. The touch panel interface consists of six lines for the touch panel coördinates, a touch panel strobe line, and the X and Y coordinate return lines, as shown. The six touch panel coordinate lines are driven by a six bit counter in the UIL 12, the six lines being decoded to integrate one X and one Y matrix row and column at a time. There are 37 LED and photosensftive transistor pairs in the X horizontal direction,and 41 in the Y vertical direction. The 64 bit six line counter therefore can service each row and column once per counter cycle. If a light beam of the matrix is interrupted, there will be a return to the UIL 12 on the appropriate return line at the time a strobe and the associated count is presented to the UI 11. After a complete cycle, an X coordinate and a Y coordinate will have been received by the UIL 12, determining a point on the two dimensional CRT face that has been touched. A slight complication is created by the ambient room light which must be distinguished from the LED beam. This is accomplished by biasing the light sensitive transistor so that there is no reaction to the ambient light conditions. This may be done automatically by first applying an appropriate control signal to a selected photosensitive transistor to saturate it with ambient room light and then turning on the corresponding LED to sense additional light. In this particular system, the matrix was designed to be driven by a counter which stops at a count of 37 in the horizontal direction and 41 in the vertical. As the count runs past these numbers, interrupts will be generated.To prevent these various responses a RAM control memory is supplied in theUIL 12 which maps the inputs into valid outputs, thus a non interrupt is always produced, ultimately, for columns numbered greater than 37 and rows numbered greater than 41. This same RAM has an additional use. A matrix row or column may be defective, and generate an interrupt continually. This problem could also be discovered by a diagnostic run at turrron time, and the control RAM programmed automatically to disregard interrupts on the defective channel.However, the matrix will still be usable for two reasons. First, a touching of the panel usually interrupts two or more channels in any direction so that the loss of a channel would not affect the operation. Second, the software may be written to shift the display keys away from a defective row or column. Another complication arises when more than one row or column registers an interrupt. In fact, this is usually the case since the matrix is one quarter of an inch between rows and columns, and the operator s finger will usually intersect several in each direction. In a display of keys an uncertainty may arise. The preferred solution is for the software to compute the center point of the two or more interrupts in each direction, and use the key that encloses, or is nearest to, that point. To accomplish this function, the UIL 12 contains X and Y max min registers, a control RAM functionally described above and the touch panel scan counter, also previously described, all of which will be described in more detail below. In this CRT one odd and one even fill are interlaced to produce one frame , and the vertical sync pulse issued to start a new frame. The scan counter completes its count in approximately three fourths of the frame time.Therefore, the vertical sync pulse is used to reset and restart the touch panel scan, and the results are latched out to the UIL 12 during the retrace time directly before the next vertical sync pulse. In this embodiment, there is one sync pulse every 12.5 m sec, 80 fills per second and 40 frames per second. At the end of each frame the X and Y co ordinates are latched out from the UI 11 on the return lines to the data handling portion of the UIL 12 into the X and Y max min registers, and therefrom, to the computer 10 which interprets this information into a suitable machine command or into the registered UI display. The actual control of the Ul 11 is accomplished by the CRT video handling and control portion of the UIL 12, and more specifically by a Motorola type 6845 CRT controller LSI chip. The CRT video handling circuit provides hori zontal sync, vertical sync, interlaced field control and character generator memory addressing. In this embodiment, there are 875 scan lines, and about 612 dots per scan. The CRT video handling part of the UIL 12 comprises two scan line buffers, each implemented from four buffer register parts, each 256 by 4 bits, a cursor data buffer and a processor interface through which the data transfer takes place. The process is as follows. A complete display bit map is prepared in the main memory of computer ío as explained in U S Patent No.4,103,331. The CRT controller chip generates a vertical sync pulse at the beginning of the frame, which is used as a display enable. Thereafter, for each time that a scan line of video is required, a system interrupt is issued to the computer 10 which responds by filling the scan line buffer with 612 video data bits. In fact, there are two scan line buffers, one being loaded while the other is supplying video to the UI in real time. As shown in Figure 18, the CRT video handling portion of the UIL generates a Display Enable signal which signifies that the scan has settled at the top of the screen and is ready to accept video. The series of interrupts are then generated to produce the frame. However, at these interrupts, the scan buffers are not uniformly filled. The bandwidth may be significantly reduced by setting a horizontal tab counter instead of actually sending video which is all white. Then, as the tab counter is counted down, no video which is interpreted as white video is transmitted from the buffer. When the tab counter reaches zero, video is again output. A numerical example would be as follows Assume there are 10 words of white video, and then 15 words of random video in a particular scan line. The tab counter would be set to 10 and the 15 words of random video loaded into the buffer.To read out, first the scan buffer counts down 10 counts, then it outputs the 15 words of random video. The result is a decreased bandwidth requirement between the computer 10 main memory and the UIL 12. Between the UIL 12 and the UI, data transfer of four parallel bits per word are timed by a video clock at a rate compatible with the CRT timing. The cursor handling portion of the UIL 12 comprises the cursor control circuits and a cursor buffer. In this system a cursor is defined by a rectangular area within which the cursor is contained, and also by a shape arrow, bar, dot, etc. . A cursor data buffer is loaded with the cursor shape which is then coupled out to the scan line buffer in the same way that a character generator would, to generate a particular video pattern. An electronic pointer is used to define the upper left corner of the cursor to position the cursor and the screen. In this embodiment, the cursor is defined within a 32 x 32 dot square, and is simply ORed with the video to produce a final image. Of course, provisions can be made to reverse the cursor color to allow it to be the reverse of the background video color. The detailed schematics will now be discussed. Figure 19 is the Ul control logic interface to the computer or processor 10 which couples system data to the processor. Various signals are multiplied through eight multipliers one of which, il8, is shown, onto a total of 16 Mux lines, two of which, IMux 12 and 13, are shown, and then buffered through two data buffers one of which, fl9, is shown. Typical signals are vertical and horizontal sync, diagnostic flags, video control signals, touch panel X and Y coordinates, odd even fill, and power on off which initiates the power down sequence . The outputs are finally coupled onto the computer input data bus, lines Idata 00 through Idata 1 5. The computer in this embodiment has a seventeenth parity input line, Idata 16, not shown in this diagram. Figure 29 is a schematic of the computer or processor output lines to the User Interface control logic unit, the UIL 12. The 0 register G14 is an instruction decoder which translates the contents of several processor output address lines Oaddr 5 7 into specific discrete control line commands. Examples are the discrete lines to set the cursor memory load, SelCuvsMLd, set buffer pointer load, SelBPLd, set tab pointer load, SelHTabLd, and set cursor pointer load, SelCPLd. Register hl9 and e19 are data buffer registers for the computer output data lines Odata OQ 15. Parity generators hl4 and 1 14 generate odd and even parity bits for the data and the processor parity bit, Odata 16 is handled in separate logic as shown. Figure 21 is the circuit which processes the horizontal tab. Eight buffered processor output data lines OutD 08 15 are buffered in register al2 and are used to set the tab counter al3 and b13. The control for this counter is supplied by counter b14 which produces the clock for counter al3, b13 under the appropriate conditions. In other words, the Horizontal Tab Counter a13 and b13 is parallel loaded through the H Tab Register from the processor and then counted down with clocks from counter b14. The purpose of this Tab counter is as described above. In the upper part of Figure 7, flip flop hl3b generates a signal to indicate whether the CRT is on an odd or even scan, as indicated by the signalsBuffer 2 and Buffer 1, respectively. As shown, the sync pulses trigger the flip flop hl3b to alternate on every scan. The set and reset lines are for diagnostic purposes only. In all cases, the original signals are generated by and coupled from the processor. Figure 22 is data buffer No. 1 for even scan line data. Buffer No. 2, for odd scan line data, is identical and therefore not included. During the loading of data from the processor, one is being loaded while the other is supplying video to the CRT. Each F93422 RAM has a capacity of 256 x 4 bits resulting in a total buffer capacity of 256 x 16 bits. Two counter devices, f14 and f13, are used to implement the data buffer address counter, the eightbit output, DBEAddv 0 7 supplying the addresses for the RAM s el5, fits, g15 and hIS. The RAMs may be parallel loaded from the processQr on lines OutD 00 15 and are selected and enabled by decoder e146.The clock input to the address counter f14, f13, line EnCt is supplied from the H tab Counter a13, b13 ofFigure 7. The data buffer counter f14, f13 may also be parallel loaded on linesDBCntr 0 7 from the processor. The final output is four parallel bits of video data coupled out on lines NBB 0 3. Figure 23 is a schematic of the cursor logic, including the cursor memory glO, a 256 x 4 bit RAM. The eight address lines CURSYd 0 4 andCURSNa 1 3 are the cursor pointer lines from registers fll and Ill. The other main components are the cursor register f12 and gl2 which is loaded by the processor, and the cursor counter, gll and hll, which receives a count in parallel on inputs B0 B3, and counts down from the start of the scan line HORl2Sync using the cursor clock CMClk to start the cursor at the proper point on the scan. The cursor memory glO stores the cursor image itself which could be an arrow, a bar, or any other simple image which can be created on a 32 x 32 bit matrix. As shown, the cursor image is output four parallel bits at a time. However, since the cursor must be able to start on any bit within each four bit nibble, the cursor mask PROM 256 x 4 bits h10 is provided to output signals MASK 0 3 to gates 109 a d to allow the cursor image, as buffered through register h12 and multiplier h09, to begin on any bit. The XC8 and XC9 inputs to gates el2f and el2g are received from the processor and control multiplier h09, the total result of the masking function being to enable output bits from the cursor memory glO at the appropriate point within the four bit nibble. Two cursor start signals are required, one supplied by counters hll and 1 11 to start the cursor at the appropriate point on the scan line x direction , the other supplied by counters fil and gll to start the cursor on the appropriate scan lines y direction . As shown, some of these outputs are used CURSYa 0 4 to address the cursor memory glO. The ORing of the cursor and video data is done in the circuit shown in Figure 24, the cursor being supplied on lines Curs 0 3 from Figure 23 and the video being supplied on lines NBB 0 3 from Figure 22. The video is supplied through a multiplexer and latch d04 for timing purposes and is then ORed with the video in gates e04a d to produce the final video which is sent out on linesVData 00 03 to the Figure 27 circuit. Gates c13d and 110 of Figure 24 provide a cursor pointer, CursPtEn, which controls the cursor bit counter 1 11 of Figure 23, and therefore enables when to start and stop the cursor on each scan line. Thus, there will be a cursor pointer at the beginning and end of the cursor on each scan line that intersects the cursor. The remainder of the circuits comprise a CRT Controller Device, a character generator and enough memory to display messages to the generator even when the remainder of the system, including the main processor, becomes inoperative. In normal operation the processor creates the fonts and loads the buffers with a bit map which is simply displayed by the CRT. However, when the processor is not operating, the CRT Controller and associated circuits can still generate messages, allowing the generator to run limited diagnostics, and be informed of the system status. To accomplish this function, the remainder of the circuits in the described embodiment have a separate power supply. The result is a stand alone display system which can be exercised separately from the remainder of the system, an inherent advantage in using an interactive display to control a computer system. Figure 25 is a schematic diagram of the CRT controller section and includes the CRT controller, part number MC6845. This part receives control signals and chip parameters from the processor, such as the number of scan lines in the display, the number of bits per scan line, and the interlaced mode command. Output lines CRTMA 0 12 are character generator memory address lines, and are used to address the local memory of Figure 11 which contains operator messages which are used in the local mode when the system processor is inoperative. This CRT controller also generates the vertical and horizontal sync pulses which are latched through device b06 and several gates to theCRT. The Disable signal is similarly latched out through multiplexer 208 to the processor and indicates whether the current fill is odd or even, and with the sync pulses, enables the output of the video from the processor when needed. The scan line address output lines from the CRT controller RAdr 04 are connected to the registers bO5, b06 along with lines DR Data e7 which may be driven by either the local message store of Figure 28 or the processor.In either case, the outputs PR.AO IO are coupled to the front generator ofFigure 26. The Figure 26 circuit comprising PROMs gO5, g06, K05, hO5, h06, and k06, is the local font storage, and is used if the central processor is inoperative. The address lines PR.AI IO are coupled from Figure 25 and the video output is coupled to the CRT on lines CGData 0 3. Figure 27 shows the path of the four bit video nibbles which are supplied on lines VData 00 03 from Figure 24 through register g07 where they are output in serial form to the CRT on the CRT.VIDEO line. Figure 28 is a schematic of the page buffer comprising a 3K x 8 bit memory implemented from RAM devices p05, rO5, sO5, p06, r06, and s06.Address information is received on lines DRAdr 0 9 from multiplexers h07,R08 and R09 which select from address information from the processor on lines Adr 0 9 or from the CRT controller f06 of Figure 25 on lines CRTMA 0 9 in the local mode. In either case its memory contents, which is a maximum of three thousand ASCII characters, will be output on lines DRData O3 to the registers b05 and b06 of Figure 25. Line DRWR is the read write enable line, allowing this memory to be loaded from the processor on the input output linesDRData 0 7. Figure 28 also contains the address control for the character generator memory. This comprises a multiplexer kO7 and decoder k08 for enabling two of the six memory devices pOS, p06, v05, v06, 505 and 506. TheDRWR line controls the read write enable function. Figures 29 and 30 are the touch panel interface. The touch panel counter tOl t02 of Figure 29 counts through the rows and columns, driving the control RAM u02. This RAM is loaded with the appropriate data corresponding to the number of CRT rows and columns so that an enable X strobe, ENBX and an enable Y strobe ENBY, will be generated for each CRT row and column, as implemented by a photo diode and transistor pair. The data to load the RAM are originally received from the processor on lines Data 0 3, and the RAM output is also output on the same lines. The counter tOl t02 output also drives the touch panel strobe through register u01. In Figure 30, the count of the touch panel counter tOl, t02 is latched into register h03 when the first x hit occurs. Similarly the count at the time of the last x hit is loaded in register k03. These two values are then coupled out on the Data O7 lines to the processor where the center of the x hit is calculated. Registors g04 and hO4 are the Y minimum and maximum registers. Figure 30 gates g09a and gO9b couple the X and Y coordinate returns to the UIL from the touch panel, as shown also in Figure 18. The remainder of the logic in Figure 30 uses the timing of the X and Y return signals to produce signals TPX, HI, TPX.LO, TPY.HI and TPY.LO to latch the registers h03, g04, k03 and k04 as described above.
