It is envisaged that the compositions of the present invention, particularly in the form of disinfectant wipes or sprays, will be of use in hospitals and surgeries to clean hard surfaces, such as operating tables and instrument trays, surgical instruments and machinery.The effectiveness of the compositions of the present invention is thought to be due to the use of three types of biocidal agent contained therein which provide a broad spectrum of immediate and residual biocidal activity.Some preferred embodiments in accordance with the present invention will now be described by way of Example. EXAMPLE 1 The following ingredients were mixed together Denatured ethanol 700 ml Bardac 205 M 2.Og Chlorhexidine gluconate 2.5gThe mixture was made up to 1 litre with water.Alternatively, 12.5ml of chlorhexidine gluconate BP a 20 aqueous solution of chlorhexidine gluconate can be used in place of the solid chlorhexidine gluconate. Bardac 205 M has the following composition Alkyl C141 50 C121 40 C16, 10 dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride 20 Octyl decyl dimethyl ammonium chloride 15 Dioctyl dimethyl ammonium chloride 7.5 Didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride 7.5 Inerts 50 The final composition therefore contained 70 v v denatured ethanol, 0.25 w v biguanide antimicrobial agent and o.lX of quaternary ammonium compounds. If desired, up to 0.2 w v of a fragrance may be added to the composition. EXAMPLE 2 The following ingredients were mixed together Isopropyl alcohol 700 ml Bardac 205 M 0.4g Vantocil 1B 25 mlThe mixture was made up to a volume of 1 litre with water.Vantocil 1B is an aqueous, slightly opalescent, pale yellow liquid containing 20 of a polymeric biguanide hydrochloride. It has a viscosity ot 3 5 cP 250C and a specific gravity of 1.035 250C . The final composition therefore contained 70 isopropyl alcohol, 0.5 w v active biguanide compound and 0.02 w v active quaternary ammonium compounds. If desired, up to 0.2 w v of a fragrance may be added to the composition. EXAMPLE 3Disinfectant wipes were prepared by dipping a roll of non woven fabric into the composition of Example 1 or Example 2. The fabric was either a binder free non woven fabric, or a modified entangled rayon fibre fabric bonded with 5 of Primal HA8 binder supplied by Chicopee Ltd. of New Brunswick U.S.A. The impregnated roll was placed in a hermetically sealed evaporationresistant container prior to use. EXAMPLE 4The composition of Example 1 or Example 2 was also mixed with Arcton 12, a fluorocarbon propcllant, in a weight ratio of 70 30. and placed under pressure in an aerosol spray can be arranged to produce a fine mist. The aerosol mixture was prepared and placed in a pressurised container using conventional techniques and additives. The container was provided with a 360 valve. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTSA hard surface was simulated by use of a 15 cm x 15 cm white ceramic tile. The surface was divided into two equal portions by a line drawn thereon, and both portions were contaminated with bacteria by spraying, using a hand atomiser. The spray contained a test organism at a concentration of between 1Q7 and 108 organisms per ml.Tests were carried out using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staph. aureus, E coli and Salmonella choleraeusis.The tile was allowed to dry in air for about 10 minutes.It was shown that the dried tiles had approximately 8 x 105 organisms per tile 3.5 x 103 orgelisms per cm2 .One portion of the tile was treated by either wiping or spraying with a disinfectant composition. In the case of spraying, care was taken to ensure that the untreated portion of the tile was fully covered. The tile was again allowed to dry in air for up to 10 minutes Samples were taken from the treated and untreated poritons of the tile by taking RODAC plate impressions, The RODAC plates contained 0.75 TWEEN 80 Registered Trade Mark and 0.75 lecithin. The TWEEN 80 and lecithin act to neutralise the activity of any biocidal compounds in the sample and are used following the procedure of Babb et al J. of Hosp.Inf., 2,267 272 . The tile was then recontaminated over the whole area by respraying from the hand atomiser. The tile was allowed to dry in air for approximately 10 minutes.Samples were again taken from the treated and untreated portions and plated using RODAC plates. All the plates were incubated at 320C.for 48 hours.The plates covered with samples from the untreated portions are called Control 1 and Control 2 and the plates covered with samples from the treated portions are called Treatment and Residual in the followingTable 1.The results given in Table 1 are for use of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but similar results have been obtained using other organisms.In Table 1, indicates that confluent growth of the organism was observed, indicates no growth or a few isolated colonies of growth was observed, Test 1 refers to wiping with an Azo Wipe wipe a wipe saturated in 70 isopropyl alcohol , Test 2 to spraying withDISPRAY 2, a commercially available spray containing 0.02 chlorhexidine gluconate in 70 IMS Test 3 t9 wiping with a wipe including a composition according to the present invention and Test 4 to spray with a composition according to the invention. In Tests 3a and 4a, a composition according to Example 1 was used and in Tests 3b and 4b, a composition according toExample 2 was used.In tests Sa or b I, the binder free fabric was used and in Tests 3a or b II, the bound fabric was used. TABLE 1Test Control 1 Control 2 Treatment Residual 1 2 3a I 3a II 3b I 3b II 4a 4b It can be seen from the Table that presently available wipes or sprays are able to confer immediate protection on a hard surface, but this protection is Sort lived, whereas wipes or sprays including compositions according to the present invention confer on the surface a resiaual biocidal activity. This residual activity can last for up to 24 hours.It is possible that, in the above test procedure, the inactivation effect of the TWEEN 80 and lecithin may not be immediate due to the time needed to complete inactivation. Therefore, to confirm the residual activity of the compositions of the present invention the following test was employed. It is derived fromLowbury and Lilly s technique for determining the number of viable bacteria removed from hands when washing. B.M.J., May 14, 1960, 1448 1450 .A ceramic white tile 15 Cm x 15 cm was treate9 with a biocide formulation, either by wiping or spraying, and allowed to dry and stand for a certain time. Thereafter a carefully controlled number of organisms was sprayed onto the tile. The tile was placed in a sterile polyethylene bag containing 100 ml of a neutraliser solution 1 TWEEN 80, 1 lecithin . After 1 minute of uniform gentle agitation, 1 ml aliquots were removed, diluted in phosphate buffer and plated out with molten tryptone soya agar. The viable number of surviving organisms can be calculated after incubation at 320C for 48 hours.The number of viable organisms recovered from the tile treated with a wipe composition according to the present invention can be calculated as survivors against those found with the commercially available A o Wipe or Dispray 2, i.e. survivors is equal to number viable using a composition according to the present invention x 188 number viable using either Azo Wipe or Di spray 2Table 2 shows the results obtained using a wipe of the present invention incorporating a eomposiçion according to Example 2 against commercially available products, with various reinfecting organisms.The composition according to Example 1 has very similar activity to that of Example 2 and therefore a test using a wipe incorporating a composition according to Example 1 against the organisms given in Table 2 would yield results closely similar to those given in Table 2.

This confirms the previous results, and shows that the composition according to the present invention confers a residual biocidal activity relative to the commercially available products.If a surfactant, such as Pluronic F 88 or Lexaine C, is included in the composition, cleaning of soiled surfaces is facilitated. It was shown that the composition of the present invention is active against a wide range of bacteria, includingPseudomonas varieties, by standard tests.The active ingredients in the composition according to the invention have proved histories of low toxicity.Therefore its use should present no problems from this point of view. Moreover, the composition may be used, without adverse effects, on a wide variety of substrates, such as most metals, adequately compounded rubbers and plastics. However, biguanide compounds may tarnish copper and it may be advisable not to use the present composition on copper utensils or surfaces.Thus the present invention provides a composition which can be used to confer residual biocidal activity on a disinfected surface.
