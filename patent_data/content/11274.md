# Composite material for secondary container packaging.

## Abstract
A secondary container packaging material for use in six pack can wraps, six pack bottle carriers, twelve pack carriers, etc, comprising a composite of a paper material 12 lami nated to a plastic film 14 . The plastic film provides tear resistance to the composite, so that paper material may be used which has a tear resistance less than that of other secon dary packaging paper materials. The reduced tear resistance allows the use of paper having a lower caliper, basis weight, and, therefore, cost than conventional secondary container packaging material. Natural kraft paper and recycled paper of 12 16 point caliper are preferred for use with the present composite. The plastic film may be .25 2 mils thick and is preferably formed of polyethylene terphthalate, polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, or cel lophane. The preferred films are transparent and permit reverse printing 26 on their inner surface 32 to provide abrasion resistant decoration visible through the film. Adhe sives 28 are used to bond the film to the paper and are selected to be compatible with the film used. The film may be metallized to produce a foil effect or may be strengthened by radiation treatment 24 .
