# Throttle position sensor.

## Abstract
A trottle position sensor 10 having a potentiometer module 14 which fits into a connector casing 12 for mounting on a carburetor or an air fuel mixture control system for an internal combustion engine. The position sensor assembly is mounted such that movement of the butterfly valve and thus the trottle, acts to move the wiper element of the potentiometer in a predictable manner. The modules can be tested independently of the casing and rejected without unnecessary waste. Additionally, the same potentiometer module can be used with different connector casings. The potentiometer module 14 includes a one piece casing 36 having an integrally formed cantilever bearing system with two spaced bearing surfaces 49, 53 for rotatably mounting the rotor 40 holding the potentiometer wipers 66 and a pilot diameter boss 46 aligned with the axis of rotation of the rotor 40 . Longitudinal movement or end play of the rotor 40 within the casing is limited by positioning two stop members 122, 134 on either side of an annular ridge 131 extending outwardly from the rotor 40 .
