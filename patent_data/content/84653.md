# Composite concentric gap magnetic lens.

## Abstract
A composite objective lens for a particle beam litho graphic system having deflection coils within the bore of the lens, a solenoidal excitation lens coil, a first set of two or more cylindrical pole pieces with a lens gap and a second set of cylindrical pole pieces arranged concentrically out side the first pole pieces but within the excitation lens coil. The second set of pole pieces is constructed of a high saturation material such as iron with a lens gap coextensive with the gap in the first set of pole pieces. The return flux from the deflection coils is carried by the inner cylindrical pole pieces only, while the flux generated by the lens coil is shared by both the inner and outer pole pieces. With this arrangement the linear relationship between the axial field strength and excitation current is maintained at all points along the axis of the lens, and saturation of the inner pole piece is avoided.
