## Description
DESCRIPTION CC i.T ThBT E CIBSE DER This invent Ion relates to an improved contractable closure member for sealing open ended containers. Contractable closure members for sealing openended containers are known. However, such known closure members either have an actuable element protruding from the top wall of the cover or are restricted to circular shaped closures in ordeal to obtain substantially uniform radial stretching of the closure bottom wall. It is an object of the present invention to provide a contractable closure member of an improved construction which provides advantages over known contractable closure members. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a contract able closure member for sealing an open ended container, said closure member comprising a top wall, a bottom wall formed from an elastic material and having an integral upwardly extending continuous side wall, seal means in said side wall, said side wall being secured to said top wall with said bottom wall held in spaced relationship therewith, a retracting lever pivotally secured below said top wall and having an engagement end and a pusher end, said pusher end being arcuately displaceable against a central portion of said bottom wall to distend said bottom wall whereby to draw said side wall inwardly to remove sealing pressure when positioned for sealing engagement in an open ended container. Such a contractable closure member can have a top wall which is substantial .y flat, thereby permitting stacking of articles onto the cover and permitting a container having the cove to be stored in an area of smaller height than with prior art closure members. Also, the closure member being of substantially reduced thickness requires less space for storage and shipping. In accordance with a second aspect of the invention there is provided a contractable closure member for sealing an open ended container, said container having at least one straight wall portion adjacent an open end thereof, said closure member comprising a top wall, a bottom wall formed from an elastic material and having an integral upwardly extending continuous side wall contoured for close fit in said container open end, seal means in said side wall, said side wall being secured to said top wall with said bottom wall held in spaced relationship therewith, a displaceable element engageable from above said top wall and actuable to cause relative displacement between said top wall and bottom wall by applying pressure in a central portion of said bottom wall to distend said bottom wall, and means causing substantially uniform withdrawing of said side wall when said bottom wall is distended. Such a contractable closure member may have various contour configurations such as circular, rectangular, square, rectangular with rounded corners, etc. A contract able closure member in accordance with the present invention can require only single hand operation and can therefore be easy to dismantle and clean. A contractable closure member in accordance with the invention can have a retractable lever which is displaceable to two distinct positions when used with an open ended container, thereby indicating that the closure member is in sealing engagement or in a non sealing engagement with the container. Advantageously, the bottom elastic wall is constructed such as to coact with the retracting lever such as to permit substantially uniform stretching thereof when distended. A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a sectional side view showing the construction of the contractable closure member positioned in an open ended container Figure 2 is a sectional side vie, as inFigure 1, showing the contractable closure member with the elastic bottom wall distended by the retracting lever Figure 3 is a top plan view of the contractable closure member Figure 3a is a cross sectional side view along cross section lines A A of Figure 3 Figure 3b is a cross sectional side view along cross section lines B B of Figure 3 Figure 4 is a top plan view of the bottom wall as seen from inside the closure member Figure 4a is a cross sectional side view along cross section lines C C of Figure 4 Figure 4b is a cross sectional side view along cross section lines D D of Figure 4 Figure 5a is a plan view of the retracting lever Figure 5b is a side view of Figure 5a and Figure 6 is a side view of the disc. Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown generally at 10, the contractable closure member positioned within the open top end 12 of an open ended container 11.The closure member comprises a top wall 13, herein a rectangular top wall formed of a rigid thermoplastic material, such as polystyrene or polypropylene material.A bottom wall 14, Fi ire 4, is formed of an elastic material, such as low density polyethylene, and has an upwardly extending continuous side wall 15 formed therewith which is detachably secured to the top wall 13 at its upper edge,, as viewed in Fig.1. The side wall 15 spaces the bottom wall 14 from the top wall 13, as shown. A continuous seal bead 16, which constitutes seal means is formed integrally with the side wall 15 and engages the inner wall surface 12 in the open top end portion 12 of the container 11 when the closure member is positioned therein with the bottom wall 14 being in a normal position as shown in Figure 1. A retracting lever 17 is pivotally secured to the top wall 13 in a manner which will be described in detail later, and defines an engagement end 18 and a pusher end 19. As seen in Figure 1, by pulling the engagement end 18 of the lever 17 out of the plane of the top wall 13 see phantom lines 17 the pusher end 19 is arcuately displaceable against a, central portion 20 of the bottom wall 14 to distend the bottom wall whereby the side wall 15 will be drawn inwardly to remove the sealing pressure of the seal bead 16 against the inner wall 12 in the open end portion 12 whereby to remove sealing engagement of the closure member 10 with the open ended container. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the open ended container is preferably formed with an annular shoulder 21 whereby the closure member 10 will rest in the open top end portion 12 when the sealing pressure of the closure member is removed. Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 6, there is also shown a friction disc 22 removably secured to the inner face 23 of the bottom wall 14 over the central portion 20 thereof. The disc 22 has a concave top face 2Xs to receive the free end 19 of the pusher end 19 of the lever 17 in frictional displacement thereover when the engagement end of the lever is displaced outwardly of the top wall whereby to apply pressure in the direction of arrow 25 to space the bottom wall 14 away from the top wall 13 to distend the elastic bottom wall causing the sidewalls 15 to be retracted inwardly to remove sealing pressure as previously mentioned.The disc 22 is also formed cf a rigid material such as polystyrene or polypropylene material and protects the bottom wall 14 from wear and further provides a better distribution of the pressure G radially about the bottom wall 14. The disc 22 is provided with a bottom shoulder 26 whereby the disc may be retained in a snap fit within a disc retaining cavity 27 see Figures 4a and 4b formed centrally in the inner top face 23 of the bottom wall 14. The disc retaining cavity 27 has a peripheral retaining ridge 28 to engage over the bottom shoulder 26 of the disc. Referring now to Figures 3, 3a and 3b, there is shown the construction of the top wall 13. The top wall has a substantially uniform top surface 30 with a cavity 31 formed therein to house the retracting lever whereby the lever rests substantially in or below the plane of the top surface 30. The cavity 31 defines a flat support portion 32 spaced inwardly and substantially parallel to the top wall 13. The cavity also defines a finger insertion portion 33 at an end of the cavity 31 spaced from the top wall centre portion 34 to permit finger engagement of the engagement end 18 of the lever 17, as is clearly shown inFigure 1. The finger insertion portion 33 extends below the support portion 32 whereby the free end of the engagement end 18 of the lever extends over the portion 33 for ease of engagement of the lever. As also seen from the illustrated embodiment, the cavity 31 is substantially of a rectangular shape and defines two parallel side walls 36 and an end wall 37, located remotely from the central top portion 34. An opening 35 or slot is formed in the cavity 31 and located generally along the top centre portion 34.The cavity 35 is formed by a cut out portion in the flat support bottom wall 32 immediately under the said top wall central portion 34 and the space created by not having an end side wall portion of the cavity 31 in this area. Thus, the parallel side walls 36 form a free end portion 36 which extends across the opening at a respective end thereof. A pivot connection, herein a groove 38, informed in the bottom edge 39 of the free end portion 36 of the side walls 36 whereby to retain the lever 17 and permit arcuate displacement thereof, as will be described later. Referring now to Figures 1, 2, 5a and 5b, it can be seen that the lever 17 extends within the opening 35 and is pivotally secured on an axis extending substantially along t he opening 35 which is shown in Figure 3 as being an elongate rectangular slot.This pivot axis is formed along an axis passing through opposed pivot pins 40 located on each side of the retracting lever 17 which is shown in Figure 5a as being generally of rectangular configuration. These pivot pins have an eccentric transverse end flange 41 which prevents the lever 17 from pivoting outwardly of the top wall when the container is angulated or placed upside down. These shoulders fit in a respective one of the grooves 43 of flanges 42, as described below, and the eccentric prevents free rotation of the pivot pins. As shown in Figures 4a and 4b, the bottom wall 14 is further provided ih a pair of upstanding flanges 42 extending from the inner top surface 23 of the bottom zall 14 and spaced on a respective side of the disco retaining cavity 27 and lie outwardly of the parallel side walls 36. Also, a recess or groove 43 is formed in the top edge 44 of each flange 42 with the grooves 43 lining up with respective flanges 41 of the pivot pins 40.As previously described, the flange 41 is of eccentric shape as well as the groove 43 and the upward pressure of the groove 43, due to its position relative to the top wall, cause the flange 41 to position itself in fitting engagement in the groove 43 to apply a closed biasing force on the lever to maintain the lever horizontally in a locked position. The pivot pins of the retracting lever 17 are captive in the grooves 38 of the side wall 36 and the end flange 41 in groove 43 of the flange 42 when the lever is positioned horizontally within the cover. As soon as the retracting lever is pulled out of the cover to remove the clamping pressure, the pusher end 19 of the lever pushes the bottom wall 14 away from the top wall 13 thereby separating the grooves 43 from the grooves g8. however, in this position, a pressure exists along the plane of the lever maintaining the pivot pins 40 in the grooves 38. The retracting lever 17 is displaceable within an arc of approximately 900 and is stopped at its vertical position, as shown inFigure 3, by the oppositely disposed terminal edges 32 and 13 of the flat support portion 32 and top wall 13 respectively.Thus, when the lever is fully retracted, it is maintained in a substantially vertical position, as snown in Figure 2. This is an indication to the user that the cover, altnoubh positioned within the open ended container, is in non sealing engagement with the container 11. This is useful when it is not ne√ßessar to seal the continer but to cover the open end and to permit easy removal of the cover such as when it is required to continuously insert foodstuff or other substancc within the container. As shown in Figure 5a, the free end 19 of the pusher end 19 is slightly curved to conform to the concave top face 24 of the disc 22 to provide smooth frictional engagement therewith. Further, as shown inFigures 2, 3a and 3b, an annular continuous depending wall 50 depends from the inner face 50 of the top wall 13 to solidify the top wall in the lever area and to support the bottom wall 14 to prevent distortion thereof and to keep it in a slightly stretched prestressed condition whereby as soon as the retracting lever 17 is actuated and the pusher end engages the disc 22, the bottom wall will start retracting the side walls 15.Otherwise, if the bottom wall was not pre stretched, the initial displacement of the pusher end against the disc would cause stretching of the bottom wall 14 at its central area before any retracting force is applied on the side wall 15, its outermost areas Therefore, it would be necessary to make the lever pusher end lower and requiring more force by the user to obtain the same results. With reference to Figures 1, 3a and 4a, it can be seen that the top wall 13 is captive at designated points along its outer periphery between wall support ribs 15 and the overlap flange 15 , both formed with the side wall 15. The top wall 13 is provided with a circumferential flange 1311 formed integral therewith and recessed downwards from the top surface of the top wall 13. The flange 13 lodges itself between the top edge of rib 15 and the lower edge of the flange 15t to prevent the top wall 13 from collapsing in its circum ferential area. then the closure member is a circular closure member, as soon as the bottom wall 14 is distended, the side walls retract substantially uniformly as the spacing between the centre and the side wall is substantially constant. However, with rectangular or square containers, the side wall 15 is not equidistantly spaced from the centre. In order to maintain sealing pressure along the periphery of closure member 10 and to achieve substantially constant release of this pressure when the lever 17 is actuated, the seal bead 16 is slightly arced outwardly and thicker at the transverse central axis 52 and 53 of the rectangular closure, see Figure 4. The thickness of the bead 16 gradually diminishes towards the corners 54 of the cover.Thus, when the lever is retracted, more stretching of the bottom wall 14 will be requiredalong the axes 52 and 53 before the bead in the corners 54 retracts whereby the bead will retract substantially at the same time throughout the circumference of the closure member. Furthermore, in order to improve uniform retracting displacement of the side wall 15 the bottom wall 14 may be molded with a non uniform thickness.For example, as shown in Figure 4, the material along the axis 51, which is the longest point between the side wall 15 and the centre of the closure member, would be thicker and decrease towards the axis 52 which is the shortest point from the centre to the side wall.Thus, the elasticity of the bottom wall would vary throughout the surface area thereof. Another means for causing substantially uniform withdrcing of the side wall, when the bottom wall is distended, is achievable by modifying the disc 22 whereby it has a contour which watches the contour of the Side wall of the closure member. Thus, the disc being formed of a rigid material would extend substantially parallel and equidistantly spaced from the side wall 15 and distribute the downward pressure in a substantially uniformly spaced area on the bottom wall 14. Alternatively, the bottom wall 14 could be constructed with a thicker central base portion also contoured to be in equidistantly spaced parallel relationship with the side wall, much like the disc, except it would be molded integral with the bottom wall. It should be understood that an important feature of the present invention resides in the provision of a closure member having a distendable bottom wall which can retract a side wall which is not necessarily of circular contour. It is foreseen that a closure member of circular contour and having a straight edge portion in the contour could have the side wall thereof retracted substantially uniformly by the provision of a matching contoured disc or a thicker central portion or the provision of varying thicknesses in the bottom wall and extending radially to the portions furthermost from the central portion of the bottom wall. It is within the ambit of the present invention to cover any obvious modifications of the example of the preferred embodiment described hereinabove, provided such modifications fall within the scope of the broad claims appended hereto. Bor example, instead of the container having a shoulder 21, it may have a straight wall and the closure member could be provided with an overlapping edge. Further, the lever 17 and its cavity could have different shapes provided they perform the same function.
