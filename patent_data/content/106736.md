# SEPARATING DEVICE AND CARTRIDGE THEREFOR

## Abstract
Separating device for separating the liquid components of a liquid mixture comprising an annular coalescing medium 84 for causing the liquid component to be removed from the mixture to coalesce into droplets, and a conical separating medium 102 tapering toward a liquid collecting sump 98 . A heating element 46 heats the liquid mixture when the temperature of the mixture is below a predetermined temperature. An open, fibrous batt of filtering material 100 circumscribes the coalescing medium 84 to collect wax crystals which form during cold temperature conditions. A relief valve 108 permits liquid to bypass the separating medium 102 when the pressure differential across the separating medium 102 exceeds a predeter mined amount. Accordingly, initial flow through the separat ing device is established, permitting the heater to heat the liquid to the temperature above that at which wax crystals form.
