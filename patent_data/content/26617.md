# Process for preparing cathode for electrolysis of alkali metal chloride.

## Abstract
A porous cathode for electrolysis of an alkali metal chloride is produced from a substrate material, a catalyst, a water repellent material and a pore forming agent. The water repellent material is a combination of a first fluorinated resin having a particle diameter of 0.1 to 20µ and a melting point of 300 to 340 C and a second fluorinated resin having a particle diameter of 1 to 50µ and a melting point of 160 to 320 C. Said first resin has higher melting point that that of said second resin.
