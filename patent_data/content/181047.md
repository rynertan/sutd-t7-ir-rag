# Delay control circuit and method for controlling delays in a semiconductor element.

## Abstract
A circuit 40 constructed in accordance with this inven tion includes a ring oscillator 25 to provide a signal which is dependent on the propagation delays of the inverters 33, 34, 35 comprising the ring oscillator, therefore the frequency of the ring oscillator is inversely dependent upon the propaga tion delays of the inverter comprising the ring oscillator. Means 37 are provided to determine the propagation delay introduced by the components in the ring oscillator by measuring the frequency of the output signal produced by the ring oscillator which provides a signal to a multiplexer 36 which selects among a number of present delay components 26 those components which are necessary to ensure that the propagation delay caused by the circuitry not shown connected to the input lead 21 of the circuit constructed in accordance with this invention plus the propagation delay introduced by the selectable delay ele ments is nearly a constant propagation delay.
