## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO THE COLOURATION OF POLYOLEFINS The present invention relates to the colouration of polyolefins. When polyolefin such as polypropylene chips are coloured with the usual pigment dispersions on the market for instance the products sold under the name SANYLENE pigment dispersions made by MESSRS. SANDOZLUFILENE pigment dispersions made by B.A.S.F.FILOFIN pigment dispersions made by CIBA GEIGY and spun up into textile fibres they usually have in comparison to other synthetic textile fibres a dull and lifeless appearance. Our co pending U.K. Patent application no. 8314859 discloses that pure disperse dyestuffs and solvent dyestuffs in ground press cake form may when add mixed with 6 caprolactone produce brilliantly coloured polyolefin such as polypropylene fibres when spun from an admixture with polypropylene chips. It has now been found that many of the pigments normally used to colour polyolefin such as polypropylene fibres and which normally generally give a dull and drab finish will when admixed with a small quantity of E polycaprolactone produce fibres with a much higher transparent and brighter effect. According to the present invention there is provided a method of producing coloured polyofin material com prising admixing caprolactone with polyolefin and a pigment. Preferably the polyolefin comprises polypropylene. Preferably the polypropylene is in chip form. The caprolactone may comprise caprolactone. The mixture of polyolefin, caprolactone and pigment may be extruded to form fibres of coloured polyolefin. The present invention also extends to coloured polyolefin produced by the method defined above. The present invention will now be further described with reference to the following examples. In the examples below fibres were produced using pigments from the following table TABLE APigment C1. Nos. 1. Pigment Green C1. No. 7 2. Pigment Green C1. No. 36 3. Pigment Yellow Cl. No. 139 4. Pigment Blue Cl. No. 15 3 5. Pigment Blue Cl. No. 60 6. Pigment Brown Cl. No. 25 7. Pigment Red Cl. No. 176 8. Pigment Violet Cl. No. 23 9. Pigment Blue Cl. No. 15 10. Pigment Black C1. No. 7Example 1 To 100 kg. of homopolymer chips, fibre spinning grade, melt flow index 11 were added 0.25 uv stabiliser and 1 of red pigment Cl. No. 176. This was extruded and spun up into 15 denier round cross section fibres in the normal way. The lustre of the fibre was dull and the colour lacked life.Example 2 Example 1 was repeated but in addition 1.0 of 6 polycaprolactone with a melting point of 650C was added to the admixture. When spun up into 15 denier textile fibres in the normal lsay it was surprisingly found that the fibres had a high lustre and the colour ras much more transparent and vibrant. Example 3 Examples 1 and 2 r.ere repeated but using a spinneret, from ihich fibres were spun, having capill iaries or orifices of delta i.e. triangular cross section instead of circular cross section. It is well known that normal pigments without t polycaprolactone spun through orifices of delta cross section produce a brighter effect than fibres spun through orifices of circular cross section. However, hen t polycaprolactone is added to the formulation the degree of brilliance is enhanced as was shoTm by com paring exarilples 1 and 2. Examples 1, 2 and 3 were repeated for each of the pigments listed in the table above. A comparison of transparency and colour life was made in each case. Surprisingly the fibre containing in addition to the polypropylene, caprolactone was much brighter, cleaner looking, more transparent and with a much higher surface gloss and more pleasing non waxy or soapy handle. A further trial was made by mixing together three of the basic pigments listed in the table above to produce a modern vogue shade as would be used in the carpet industry. This colour was extruded in the form of 15 denier fibres made from an admixture of polypropylene and polycaprolactone polymers. The resulting fibre as spun up into yarn in the normal way on a semi worsted yarn spinning machine and tufted into a cut loop tufted carpet and b a cut pile carpet. After finishing the carpet was examined and it was found impossible to distinguish it from a 100 acrylic carpet from the point of view of lustre, richness of colour, feel and appearance. Polypropylene carpets have traditionally had a dull lack lustre appearance with a soapy or waxy feel and handle. Carpets made from fibre according to the present invention have a strong market appeal both from a colour and handle effect.
