# Process of manufacturing diaryl esters of dicarboxylic acids.

## Abstract
A process for preparing diaryl esters of dicarboxylic acids in which the esterification reaction is optimized by removing water and other by products of the reaction according to a predetermined pattern. The removal of water and other by products of the esterification reaction is most easily carried out by a distillation means, and the rate of removal is controlled by varying the reflux ratio in the distillation means during the course of the esterification reaction. The diaryl esters so prepared are useful in making linear polyesters.
