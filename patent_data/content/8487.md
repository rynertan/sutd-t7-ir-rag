# Installation and method for the storage of thermal energy in a pond containing a saturated aqueous saline solution.

## Abstract
Installation and method for the storage of thermal energy and its supply when required. The thermal energy may be solar or be derived from industry. For storage a pond 1 is used which holds an aqueous saline solution whose concent ration and temperature decreases from bottom to top and which is saturated at each level at the temperature there prevailing. Solid solute 4 is provided at the bottom 3 of the pond 1 . Heat extraction is effected from solution at the bot tom region and may be effected by heat exchange within the pond or by withdrawal of solution 5 from near the bottom of the pond subjecting the withdrawn solution to heat exchange outside the pond 46 and returning the solution and precipi tated solute to the pond.
