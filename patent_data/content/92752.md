# Method for seam tracking in a moving arc torch welding operation.

## Abstract
In an arc welding operation seam tracking is accom plished by determining the level of infrared radiation in a selected bandwidth, from at least two points lying in a direction forward of the arc torch travel and on opposite sides of the seam. Signal levels from the infrared detectors are compared and the difference signal is used to laterally position the arc torch. In this way, automatic seam tracking is accomplished thus facilitating robotic welding processes.
