## Description
The invention concerns a procedure for the irreversible binding of proteins onto polystyrene surfaces, polystyrene and articles obtained by this procedure and their use. The immobilization of biological active proteins, such as enzymes, antibodies, antigens, finds broad application for different purposes, e.g. in enzyme reactors, for affinity chromatography, for immune adsorption, for ligand assays with solid phase separation. A special application is that of immobilized antigens and antibodies in the field of immunoassays e.g. RIA, ELISA, etc. for the phase separation in heterogeneous sytems. The heterogeneous immunoassay systems include one or more steps, by whch a separation between bound and unbound portions of an analyte or reagent is achieved. The binding consists in antigen antibody interactions. The necessary separation can be performed elegantly, if the given binding partner the specific antibody or the specific antigen is irreversibly immobilized in reactive form on a smooth macroscopic surface. The immobilization may be performed for example, on the inner wall of the reaction vessel or on a bead which is covered by the reaction liquid. A smooth macroscopic surface is preferred to avoid a mechanical separation by for example, centrifugation or filtration as necessary by microscopically distributed surfaces e.g. latex and to decrease the amount of adhering reaction liquid which is high with porous materials as for example gels . Polystyrene surfaces coated adsorptively with proteins have found broad application in solid phase separation immunoassay systems. Polystyrene offers the following advantages The main advantage of adsorptive coating is its simplicity a protein solution of appropriate concentration is brought into contact with the plastic surface under protein adsorbing conditions for a certain time, for example, 3 16 hours, thereafter the protein solution is removed and the surface is washed. The yield is up to 60 of protein immobilized, the density is in the order of 1 µg of protein per cm². The advantage of simple coating is contrasted by drawbacks in the use with weaker binding proteins a sufficient density of coating is only achieved with a considerable excess of protein immobilization is reversible, under assay conditions i.e. in presence of other proteins or of Tween 20 for the prevention of unwanted subsequent adsorption or a loss of protein immobilized bleeding out is observed, which may interfere with the assay. Attempts exist to overcome these disadvantages of the adsorptive immobilization by introduction of a covalent binding to the plastic surface. Various procedures have been described, which make use of glutardialdehyde as a coupling reagent. The mechanism involved has not been identified, especially whether the improvements observed are due to an involvement of the glutardialdehyde in the connection to the plastic material, or if they are caused by a stabilization of the biologically active conformation of the protein by intramolecular bridging. German published patent application P 19 15 970 relates to a process for preparing a product on the basis of active protein compounds. As can be taken from the Examples, especially Examples 5, 7, 8 and 9, the protein molecules are polymerized or cured. There is no fixation on a supporting material. The fixation of the protein polymers on the support is mechanical and there is no chemical reaction between the supporting material and the protein polymers. According to the known process, it is necessary that the bridging compounds and the protein are reacted simultaneously. According to U.S. Patent 4118349 an aqueous suspension of colloidal polystyrene particles, a protein and an aromatic diazonium compound are reacted with each other. In order to stabilize the resulting suspension of protein polystyrene latex compounds it is necessary to add albumin as a stabilizer. With this procedure it is not possible to immobilize a sufficient amount of proteins homogeneously on smooth macroscopic polystyrene surfaces. In European patent application 0 008 682 there is described a latex supporting material to which a protein material is bound and a process for preparing this material. According to the known process, bis diazo benzidine 2,2 disulfonic acid is reacted with the latex material and then with the protein. The process known from this citation cannot be used for the irreversible binding of proteins onto a polystyrene surface since according to the process known the surface to be treated must have active groups. German patent application P 32 10 080 published after the priority date of this application, which must, however, be regarded as prior art in re novelty for the designated country Germany, concerns a process for the preparation of an antistreptolysine O latex reagent. According to this known process, the protein is only adsorbed to the latex and there is not obtained a chemical binding between the protein and the latex. In addition, Y irradiation cobalt sterilization of polystyrene articles is used for the improvement of the adsorptive binding of proteins, but this increases considerably the prices of commercially available articles. The objective of the present invention is therefore to make available a simple and low price procedure for the irreversible binding of proteins onto polystyrene surfaces with retention of their biological activity. This objective is achieved by the procedure according to claim 1. Further embodiments of the invention are claimed in claims 2 to 13. Alkyl or alkoxy groups are those with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, preferably methyl and methoxy. Halogen atoms are bromine, chlorine and fluorine, preferably chlorine. Preferred bis diazonium compounds are those of the general formula I a where A preferred compound of formula Ia is that, where R1a stands for a methoxy group, R2a stands for a hydrogen atom and X for C1 or BF₄ . Alternatively the bis diazonium compounds I or Ia may be used in other forms commercially available, e.g. as complexes. The pre treatment activation is performed under pre treatment conditions, e.g., at temperatures from about 5 to about 30 C, preferably 4 10 C and activation time is from about 5 to 60 min. The concentration of the bis diazonium compound is typically between about 10 ⁵ and 10 ¹ moles per liter, preferably in a buffer of pH 6 8. Suitable salts like NaCl, KI or NaJO₄ may be added for stabilization in stabilizing amounts. Before the subsequent adsorption of protein, the polystyrene surfaces are cleaned from unreacted bis diazonium compound I by washing with buffer and or water. The adsorption may be performed immediately after activation or with a time lag. The subsequent adsorption of the protein is performed under protein adsorbing conditions by incubation of the protein, dissolved e.g. at a concentration from about 10 ⁹ to 10 ³ g ml, preferably 10 ⁶ to 10 ⁴ g ml in a buffer of pH 6 8, for about 1 to about 72 hours. Any protein may be used, e.g. antibodies, antigens, hapten protein conjugates, antibody binding proteins, for example, staphylococcal protein A or complement component C The polystyrene surface with the adsorbed immobilized protein may be used for the desired purpose immediately after the adsorption or after storage. The activation of the polystyrene surfaces leads to a practically irreversible binding of proteins, which enables an increase in sensitivity, and decrease in material consumption in e.g. immuno assays no bleeding out . The activation leads to a stabilization of the adsorbed proteins, especially when a subsequent drying step is performed. The polystyrene articles may be distributed commercially after the activation or after the protein adsorption or in the form of a kit. If distributed in the form of a kit, this includes besides the polystyrene article a test tube or a microtest plate, other usual components, for example, a labelled antibody or a labelled antigen and a detecting reagent for the marker, e.g. a chromogenic substrate. The bis diazonium compounds I are well known and are prepared from the corresponding benzidines according to well known procedures.
