# PRODUCTION OF PROFILED SELF PORTABLE TILES

## Abstract
The invention provides a process and a machine by which self portable tiles for the roofs of warehouses, indust rial buildings and other structures can be produced on the building site. A machine mounted on the chassis of a truck includes a train of rolls 5 for profiling metal strip, regulation and maintenance systems corresponding to each pair of rolls, an operating system made up of a single chain 16 , and means for balancing the profiling machine through central hinges 24 and hydraulic pistons 25 , all synchronised to allow the profiling and curving of the self portable tiles produced. Another feature is a venation device that, conju gated to the profiling machine and locate between the last group of profiling rolls and the first group of bending rolls, and working synchronously with these groups, preferably using the system of movement transmission of the profiling machine, makes a transverse cold venation in the lateral longitudinal sections of the adjusted tile, offering a higher mechanical resistance to the efforts and demands originated by the wind and by the weight of the self portable.
