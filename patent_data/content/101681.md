## Description
The applicants are authors or coauthors of two articles directed to the subject matter of the instant invention 1 applicants only Studies of Endotoxin Induced Decrease in Lipoprotein Lipase Activity , J.EXP. MED. The present invention is concerned with the mechanism and magnitude of the effect that invasive stimuli may exert upon the activity of anabolic enzymes present in a host. More particularly, it relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing an antibody to a mediator composition, to monoclonal antibodies directed to such a mediator composition, and to the use of such monoclonal antibodies and of polyclonal antibodies for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for reducing toxic levels of a mediator substance in mammals and or for treating shock in mammals, and or for preventing the occurence of shock in mammals, and or for treating cachexia. Several common physiological and biochemical derangements have been seen in various mammalian hosts responding to a variety of invasive stimuli such as bacterial, viral and protozoan infections, as well as tumors and endotoxemia. For example, these responses include fever, leukocytosis, hyperlipidemia, reduced food intake and activity, and other modifications in muscle, white blood cell and liver metabolism. Recently, a hypertriglyceridemia in rabbits infected with a protozoan parasite, LPL activity has been observed by others, and it has been noted that this condition has existed when the human body was in shock. See E.B. Man, et al, The Lipids of Serum and Liver in Patients with Hepatic Diseases , J. CLIN. INVEST. While the existence of mediators was at least suspected, the effect, if any, that they had on general anabolic activity of energy storage cells was not known. The present applicants suspected that these mediators exerted a depressive effect upon the activity of certain anabolic enzymes, whose reduced activity was observed in instances where the host entered the condition of shock in response to invasion. Thus, the relationship of the mediator produced by endotoxin stimulated peritoneal mouse exudate cells, upon endotoxin sensitive and endotoxin insensitive mice alike, and the development through this investigation, of a reagent for measuring anabolic enzyme activity and the further investigation of this system in conjunction with the 3T3 L1 preadipocyte model system, and the corresponding development of methods and associated materials for developing antibodies to the mediators as well as screening procedures for the identification and development of drugs capable of controlling the activity of these mediators is all included herein. The applicants have determined that a need exists for methodology and associated diagnostic materials, to enable further investigation of the mediator phenomenon to proceed, as well as to provide practical diagnostic tools useful in the treatment of the adverse sequelae of infection and concomitant shock. The present disclosure addresses these needs. The present invention discloses a method for preparing a mediator for use in assessing the state of anabolic enzymes in mammals, which finds particular utility in the instance where the mammals are undergoing invasive stimuli such as, viral agents, bacteria, protozoa, tumors, endotoxemia and others. In its simplest aspect, the method comprises gathering a sample of macrophage cells from a mammal and incubating a portion of the macrophage cells with a stimulator material associated with an invasive event. For example, the stimulator material may be endotoxin, in the instance of endotoxemia, trypanosomes in the instance of the above mentioned protozoan parasite While the peritoneal exudate cells illustrated in our present and previous applications exemplify sources for the macrophage cells, it is to be understood that such cells may be gathered from other than the peritoneal area, and that the present invention contemplates such variation within its scope. The macrophage cells and the stimulator material are incubated as indicated, and thereafter, the macrophage cells are induced to produce a mediator substance capable of suppressing the activity of the anabolic enzymes. Preferably, the inducement of mediator production is accomplished during the incubation period which may, for example, extend up to about 20 hours. The resulting medium may be appropriately treated to recover the mediator substance, and, for example, may be centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the mediator substance drawn off, or the mediator may be precipitated with a 40 60 solution of ammonium sulfate. As mentioned earlier, the mediator substance has a broad range of effects, including inhibitive effects that have been observed with respect to anabolic enzymes such as lipoprotein lipase LPL , acetyl Coenzyme A carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, and the like. Also inhibitive effects have been found with red blood cell formation, as the mediator substance has been found to be capable of inhibiting the growth and differentiation of erythroid committed cells, by the suppression of a number of growth and differentiation inducers, such as dimethylsulfoxide DMSO , hexamethylene bisacetamide, butyric acid, hypoxanthine and the like, as illustrated later on herein in specific examples. Furthermore, the present invention discloses a method for detecting various invasive stimuli by their capability of inhibiting the activity of one or more anabolic enzymes. In this method, a plurality of macrophage cell samples, may be prepared and selectively innoculated with a number of known stimulator materials, each characteristic in its effect upon differing anabolic actors. One of the macrophage samples may be innoculated with material from the presumed situs of the infective stimulus, and all samples may thereafter be incubated in accordance with the method described above. Thereafter, testing of each of the supernatants with the mediator substances derived from the known stimulator materials, would provide a comparative continuum for the identification of any invasive stimulus found present. This testing method may utilize the 3T3 L1 cell system, for example, in the instance where lipoprotein lipase LPL activity is utilized as a parameter. Likewise, in the instance where red cell inducers are utilized, the Friend virus transformed erythroleukemia cells may be innoculated and thereafter observed. See Friend, C., Sher, W. Holland J.G. and Sato, G. PROC. NATL. ACAD. SCI. The invention also discloses methods for detecting the presence of various invasive stimuli in mammals by measuring mediator substance activity in the mammals. Thus, a number of mediator substances may be prepared from known stimulator materials, and may thereafter be used to raise antibodies capable of specifically detecting the presence of the respective mediator substances. These antibodies may be prepared by known techniques, including the well known hybridoma technique for example, with fused mouse spleen lymphocytes and myeloma, or by development in various animals such as rabbits, goats and other mammals. The known mediators and their antibodies may be appropriately labelled and utilized to test for the presence of mediator substances in, for example, serum, as one may measure the degree of infection, and determine whether infection is increasing or abating, by observing the activity of the mediator substances therein. A variety of well known immunological techniques may be utilized in accordance with this aspect of the present invention, including single and double antibody techniques, utilizing detectible labels associated with either the known mediator substances, or their respective associated antibodies. A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for preventing the occurence of shock in mammals. Having detected the presence and shock promoting activity of a mediator substance in the mammal, an antibody to the mediator substance is administered in an amount effective to prevent the development of shock in the mammal. Also, an assay system is disclosed and may be prepared for the screening of drugs potentially effective to inhibit the synthesis or activity of the mediator substance. In the former instance, the effect of the test drug on the production of mediator by stimulated macrophages is determined. In the latter instance, specific mediators may be introduced to cellular test systems, such as the 3T3 L1 cells, and the prospective drug may then be introduced to the resulting cell culture and the culture thereafter examined to observe any changes in mediator activity, either from the addition of the prospective drug alone, or the effect of added quantities of the known mediator substance. A number of materials, compounds and agents have already been tested to determine their effect, if any, on mediator substance production and activity. As discussed in further detail in the description, infra., only the steriod dexamethasone exhibited any inhibitory effect, and that effect appeared to be limited to the production of the mediator substance. Further agents, drugs, etc., can however be tested in the manner such as that employed with dexamethasone, and described herein. The preparation of mediator substances, and the determination of the importance of their activity, has resulted in the development of numerous avenues of diagnostic and therapeutic application. It is clear from the foregoing and following, that the detection of invasive stimuli may be made by the identification of mediator substances, either directly or through the development of antibodies useful in immunological diagnosis. Further, these same antibodies may be utilized for direct treatment by control of mediator activity, to avert the development of shock in mammals, while the mediator substances may be utilized as screening agents in an assay system for the identification of drugs, agents and other substance capable of neutralizing the adverse effects of the mediator substances, and thereby providing treatment of the adverse sequelae of infection. Accordingly, it is a principal object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of mammals to control the activity of said mediator substances so as to mitigate or avert the adverse consequences of their activity. Thus, the present invention relates to the embodiments characterised in the claims. Other objects and advantages will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a review of the ensuing description, which proceeds with reference to the following illustrative drawings. The figures show As stated hereinabove , we have discovered an agent which we identify herein as a mediator substance, that is produced by mammalian cells in response to stimulation by materials we refer to herein as stimulator materials, that characteristically accompany an invasive stimulus, such as bacteria, virus, some tumors, protozoa and other toxins such as endotoxemia. We have observed that the mediator substances cause the metabolism of certain of the cells of the mammal to switch from an anabolic state to a catabolic state. In particular, the mediator substances appear to suppress the activity of anabolic enzymes, such as lipoprotein lipase LPL , and the other enzymes and inducing agents listed earlier herein. It is theorized that these mediator substances are part of a communication system in mammals, between the immune system and the energy storage tissues of the body. Thus, in response to various invasive stimuli in mammals, such as those listed before, it is theorized that the mediator substances are produced and exert an effect on energy storage tissue such as adipose tissue, muscle, the liver, and the like, of the impending need for energy to combat the invasion. More particularly, the mediator substances nay cause these storage tissues to switch from an anabolic to a catabolic state, to facilitate the supply of such energy. If the invasion is of short duration, the mammal can quickly recover and replenish its energy stores however, if the invasion is of chronic nature, complete energy depletion, cachexia and death can result. During the initial work wherein the foregoing observations were made, the method for preparing the mediator was developed, and an illustrative preparation is set forth initially in Example I, in paragraph D, wherein peritoneal exudate cells were appropriately cultured and thereafter incubated in the presence of the known stimulator material endotoxin. After incubation, the macrophage cells are induced to produce the mediator substance. In one aspect, such inducement can occur over an extended incubation, however, may vary, and the invention is not limited to a specific time period. Thereafter, the mediator substance may be recovered from the cell culture and stored for later use in one or more of the ways disclosed herein. Recovery may be effected by one of numerous well known techniques, including centrifugation and precipitation. For example, the culture described in paragraph D of Example I, was centrifuged and the supernatant thereafter drawn off. Alternately, the mediator may be precipitated either with a 40 60 solution of ammonium sulfate or may be obtained by adsorption onto DEAE cellulose or like exchange resins. The choice of the particular method for recovery of the mediator substance is within the skill of the art. As mentioned earlier, the mediator substance or substances can be used to produce antibodies to themselves in rabbits, goats, sheep, chickens or other mammals, by a variety of known techniques, including the hybridoma technique utilizing, for example, fused mouse spleen lymphocytes and myeloma cells. The antibody can be isolated by standard techniques and utilized as a test for the presence of mediator substances in the suspected mammalian hosts. Further, the antibody or antibodies can be utilized in another species as though they were antigens, to raise further antibodies. Both types of antibodies can be used to determine the presence of mediator substance activity in the mammalian body, particularly in human serum, so as to determine the presence of invasive stimuli such as bacterial, viral, or protozoan infection, or the presence of certain tumors, and to follow the course of the disease. For the purposes of the following explanation, the antibody or antibodies to mediator activity, will be referred to as Ab₁ the antibody or antibodies raised in another species will be identified as Ab₂. The presence of mediator substance activity ies in the serum of patients suspected of harboring toxic levels thereof can be ascertained by the usual immunological procedures applicable to such determinations. A number of useful procedures are known. Three such procedures which are especially useful utilize either mediator labeled with a detectable label, antibody Ab₁ labeled with a detectable label, or antibody Ab₂ labeled with a detectable label. The procedures bay be summarized by the following equations wherein the asterisk indicates that the particle is labeled, and Med stands for mediator activity In each instance the mediator substance forms a complex with one or more antibody ies and that one member of the complex is labeled with a detectable label. The fact that a complex has formed and, if desired, the amount thereof, can be determined by known methods applicable to the detection of labels. It will be seen from the above, that a characteristic property of Ab₂ is that it will react with Ab₁. This is because Ab₁ raised in one mammalian species has been used in another species as an antigen to raise the antibody Ab₂. For example, Ab₂ may be raised in goats using Ab₁ as an antigen. Ab₂ therefore would be an anti rabbit antibody raised in goats. For purposes of this description and claims, Ab₁ will be referred to as a mediator activity antibody and Ab₂ will be referred to as an antibody reactive with a mediator activity antibody or, in the alternative, an anti antibody . The labels most commonly employed for these studies are radioactive elements, enzymes, chemicals with fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light, and others. A number of fluorescent materials are known and can be utilized as labels. These include, for example fluorescein, rhodamine and auramine. A preferred detecting material is anti rabbit antibody prepared in goats and conjugated with fluorescein through an isothiocyanate. The mediator composition s can also be labeled with a radioactive element or with an enzyme. The radioactive label can be detected by any of the currently available counting procedures. The preferred isotope ¹⁴C, ¹³¹I, ³H, ¹²⁵I and ³⁵S. The enzyme label can be detected by any of the presently utilized colorimetric, spectrophotometric, fluorospectrophotometric or gasometric techniques. The enzyme is conjugated to the selected particle by reaction with bridging molecules such as carbodiimides, diisocyanates, glutaraldehyde and the like. Many enzymes which can be used in these procedures are known and can be utilized. The preferred are peroxidase, β glucuronidase, β D glucosidase, β D galactosidase, urease, glucose oxidase plus peroxidase, galactose oxidase plus peroxidase and acid phosphatase. U.S. Patents No. 3,654,090 3,850,752 4,016,043 are referred to by way of example for their disclosure of alternate labeling material, and materials. High levels of mediator activity in the mammalian body may be toxic to the mammal and cause irreversible shock. The antibody ies specific to a mediator is useful to treat hosts suffering from this metabolic derangement. The patient can be treated, for example, parenterally, with a shock reducing, effective dose of the antibody to neutralize at least a portion of the mediator. The dose will, of course, vary in accordance with the factors well known and understood by the physician or verterinarian such as age, weight, general health of the patient and the concentration of the mediator. According to the present invention, antibodies specific to the aforementioned mediator s may be administered in pharmaceutical compositions in response to shock produced by viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc. These pharmaceutical compositions comprise As an adjunct to the development of antibodies and their use in the techniques described above, the present invention extends to pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of various conditions, such as shock, etc., that are found to exist as a result of undesirably high mediator substance activity in the mammalian host. In such instance, the treatment may include the detection of the presence and activity of the particular mediator substance, and the subsequent administration of the appropriate antibody or antibodies to the host, in amounts effective to neutralize the undesired mediator substance activity. The following examples relate to the isolation of the mediator substance, and the observation of their activity, as related to certain anabolic enzymes, etc. A review of the following should lend greater appreciation to the origins and potentials of the present invention. Naturally, however, the specific materials and techniques may vary, as explained earlier, so that the following is illustrative, but not restrictive of the present invention. Following the withdrawal of the medium, the dishes were rinsed once with fresh medium and the lipoprotein lipase associated with the cell membrane was released by incubation for one hour in DME medium supplemented with heparin 10 U ml and insulin 50 ng ml . After removing this medium, the dishes were rinsed with PBS and the cells were scraped into 1 ml of 50 mM, NH₃ NH₄Cl buffer, pH 8.1 containing heparin 3U ml. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice for 15 seconds and centrifuged at 500 x g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was assayed for lipoprotein lipase. Lipoprotein lipase assays were performed within 30 minutes after the preparation of each sample in duplicate by the method of Nilsson Ehle and Shotz J.LIPID. RES. 17 at 536 541 1976 with minor modifications. Briefly, 75 µl of enzyme was mixed with 25 µl of substrate containing 22.7 mM 3H triolein 1.4 uCi per mole , 2.5 per ml of lecithin, 40 mg per ml bovine serum albumin, 33 V V human serum and 33 V V glycerol in 0.27 M Tris HCl, pH 8.1, and incubated at 37 C for 90 minutes. One milliunit of enzyme activity was defined as the release of one nanomole of fatty acid per minute. The lipase activity in all three compartment was inhibited 90 by addition of 1 M NaCl and 80 by omission serum which is the source of apolipoprotein C II needed for enzymatic activity. To test the effect of the mediator on the lipoprotein lipase activity of 3T3 L1 cells, the conditioned medium obtained from mouse peritoneal exudate cells cultured in the presence or absence of endotoxin, was added to 3T3 L1 cells in monolayer culture. After a 20 hour incubation of 37 C, lipoprotein lipase activity was assessed in three compartments 1 the culture medium 2 the cell surface heparin releasable lipase activity and 3 the intracellular fraction. As shown in FIGURES 3, Cols, A C, the addition of media containing mediator substance from endotoxin stimulated exudate cells, markedly suppressed the lipoprotein lipase activity in all three compartments. The enzyme activities in the medium, on the cell surface heparin releaseable , and in the intracellular compartment were 0.1 , 6 , and 18 , respectively, of that of the control cells incubated with the same amount of fresh RPMI 1640 medium. No difference in morphology or extent of adipocyte conversion was detected between cells in the experimental and control groups. At the beginning of the study, approximately 20 of the cells exhibited triglyceride accumulation in the cytoplasm 20 hours later, approximately 50 of both the experimental and control cells have accumulated triglyceride. The medium from the culture of exudate cells not treated with endotoxin had little effect on the lipoprotein lipase activity of 3T3 L1 cells. While the medium from untreated exudate cells elicited some inhibition in the study shown in FIGURE 3, Col. B in other similar studies, medium prepared identically had no inhibitory effect. Endotoxin itself also had a negligible inhibitory effect on lipoprotein lipase activity when the amount added was equivalent to that which might remain in the conditioned medium from endotoxin treated exudate cells a 19 , 9 , and 0 decrease was observed on medium, heparin releasable and intracellular compartments, respectively. The decrease was greater 45 in medium, 17 in heparin releasable, and 11 , in the cells when larger amounts 4.5 times of endotoxin was employed, as shown in FIGURE 3, Column D. A possible explanation for the decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase described above is a direct inhibitory effect of mediators on the enzyme. This was examined by incubating medium from 3T3 L1 cell cultures which contained lipoprotein lipase with conditioned medium from cultures of endotoxin treated exudate cells. It was found that the enzyme activity was not inhibited by the mediator compositions 103 of the control at the time of mixing, and the rate of decay of enzyme activity was the same in the experimental group and the control group. Endotoxin also had no effect on the activity of lipoprotein lipase. The results imply that the mediator compositions depress lipoprotein lipase activity in 3T3 L1 cells by inhibiting the intracellular synthesis or processing of the enzyme. The relationship between the amount of mediator compositions and lipoprotein lipase activity of 3T3 L1 cells was examined by incubating the cells with increasing amounts of the conditioned medium from endotoxin treated exudate cells for 20 hours at 37 C. Ten µl of conditioned media added to 1.5 ml of culture media was sufficient to cause a substantial decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity, i.e., 57 decrease in the medium, 40 decrease in the heparin releasable compartment, and 8 decrease in the cells. Enzyme activity was further depressed by increasing the amount of mediator containing medium. When 250 µl were added, a decrease of greater than 95 was observed in all three compartments. The amount of mediator present in conditioned medium varied somewhat from preparation to preparation. The rate at which lipoprotein lipase activity declines after the addition of the mediators was also investigated. Conditioned medium containing mediators was added at selected intervals, and lipoprotein lipase activity was measured. A reduction of lipase activity was apparent as early as 30 minutes after addition to 3T3 L1 cells. Approximately half of the intracellular enzyme activity was lost after 2.5 hours. After 5 hours of incubation with a mediator, a maximal effect was observed. The amount of enzyme activity in the medium and that on the cell surface were also observed to decrease with a similar time course data not shown . The rapid decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity might reflect a competition with insulin since removal of insulin has been shown to lead to a rapid decline in lipoprotein lipase activity in 3T3 L1 cells. However, an attempt to reverse the suppressive effect of the mediator by increasing the concentration of insulin in the medium was not successful. For this study, the effect of incubating 3T3 L1 cells with media containing insulin at various concentrations 50 ng ml to 50 µg ml and mediator was assessed for lipoprotein lipase activity. It was found that the inhibitory effect of the mediator on enzyme activity was not changed with increasing insulin concentrations. Even at an insulin concentration 1,000 greater 50 ng ml than that of standard conditions 50 ng ml , the inhibition was not reversed. Reasoning that other anabolic activities of the 3T3 L1 cells might be inhibited by the mediator, we studied two key enzymes 1 acetyl CoA carboxylase and 2 fatty acid synthetase for Whether the mediator responsible for regulating the synthesis of acetyl CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase is the same as the mediator that suppresses the activity of lipoprotein lipase is not presently known. The relationship of these mediator s to the leukocyte factor that has been reported to metabolize amino acids from muscle to the liver is of considerable interest since this factor also imparts a catabolic state on the tissue. In this series of investigations, also embodied in an unpublished manuscript in preparation by the inventors herein, and coworker Shigeru Sassa, we sought to determine whether the macropage mediator s observed in Examples I and II exerted any effect upon red cell synthesis. We reasoned that, as anemia is commonly observed in mammals afflicted with chronic infections, and that as regeneration of the red cell mass constitutes a potential drain on energy and amino acids, the body in response to acute invasion may interrupt erythroid development in similar fashion and perhaps by the same mechanism observed with respect to the anabolic enzymes lipoprotein lipase, acetyl Coenzyme A carboxylase and fatty acid synthetase, that affect adipocytes. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined the effects of endotoxin induced factor s from mouse macrophages on the cellular proliferation and differentiation of a model erythroid progenitive cell the Friend virus transformed erythroleukemia cells See Friend, C. et al and Marks, P.A. et al., In this model system, cells can be induced to differentiate and form hemoglobin in response to a number of inducers, such as dimethylsulfoxide, Friend,C., et al Further, the effect of the mediator appears to be specific to certain stages of erythroid progenitor cells, in that the macrophage mediator inhibited the growth and erythroid differentiation of uncommitted stem cells more than that of erythroid committed cells which were induced by treatment with Me₂SO, HMBA, butyric acid or hypoxanthine. The inhibitory effect of the macrophage mediator on cell growth was more pronounced in cells growing logarithmically at a constant rate. Hemin treatment of Friend cells is known to cause erythroid cell maturation leading to the appearance of hemoglobinized cells but without accompanying the commitment of undifferentiated stem cells to the erythroid precursor cells Gusella, J.F., Weil, S.C., Tsiftsoglon, A.S., Volloch, V., Neuman, J.R. and Housman, D. 1976 Blood These results indicate that the endotoxin stimulated macrophage mediator exerts its inhibitory effect on the growth and differentiation of cells of erythroid precursor cells including those which have been committed to undergo erythroid differentiation. On the other hand, cells which have full expressed characteristics of erythroid cells such as increased activities of ALA dehydratase and PBG deaminase, and increased contents of protoporphyrin and heme are no longer sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the conditioned medium. Thus it appears that the action of the endotoxin stimulated conditioned medium is relatively specific to certain early stages of erythroid precursor cells but not to fully differentiated erythroid cells. We have also attempted to purify the mediator from the endotoxin stimulated macrophage conditioned medium and found that a highly purified mediator retained the inhibitory property both on lipoprotein lipase activity in 3T3 cells and on the growth and differentiation of Friend cells. The macrophage factor described in this Example is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of the anemia associated with endotoxemia or other chronic disease states, e.g., cancer rheumatoid arthritis, where the activity of the reticuloendothelial system is stimulated. The Friend cell system described here should be useful to detect such
