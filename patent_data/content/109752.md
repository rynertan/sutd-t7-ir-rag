## Description
SELECTIVE, BROADSPECTRUM WEED CONTROL IN SOYBEANS The present invention relates to an improved method of selectively controlling grassy weeds and broadleaf weeds in soybean crops. 2 Pyridyloxy or thio phenoxy alkanoate grass herbicides are well known grass herbicides that are useful for selectively controlling annual and perennial grassy weeds in the presence of desirable broadleaf crops. Benzothiadiazinone derivatives are also well known as herbicides and especially as broadleaf active herbicides. Pyridyloxytor thio phenoxy alkanoate herbicides are typically applied post emergently in the presence of nonionic surfactants. To extend the weed control spectrum in a.given application, it has been taught that pyridyloxy or thio phenoxy alkanoate herbicides be mixed with benzothiadiazinone broadleaf active herbicides and thereafter applied to unwanted vegetation to provide a broad spectrum herbicidal composition effective. against grasses and broadleaf weeds. See, for example,European Patent Application 4414 which teaches combinations of pyridyloxyphenoxy derivatives and other herbicides. In particular, European Patent Application 4414, teaches combining 2 4 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate, n butyl ester, i.e., commonly known as fluazifop butyl herbicide, with bentazon and applying the combination to soybeans for selective broad spectrum weed control. A serious problem associated with the combination of fluazifop butyl and bentazon when applied to soybean crops is an increase in phytotoxicity to the soybean plants. This is an especially annoying problem in view of the fact that the herbicidal activity to grasses of pyridyloxyphenoxy alkanoate herbicides is decreased when combined with benzothiadiazinone derivatives.In fact, technical literature distributed by the manufacturer of this herbicide acknowledges the phytotoxicity of the combination of fluazifop butyl and bentazon towards soybeans and specifically recommends avoidance of the combination being applied to soybean crops. It has been found unexpectedly that pyridyloxy or thio phenoxy alkanoate grass herbicides that have a substituent other than hydrogen in the 3 position of the pyridine ring, when combined with benzothiadiazinone herbicides, exhibit less phytotoxicity or damage to soybean plants when the combination of herbicides is applied thereto, as compared to the combinations wherein the pyridyloxyphenoxy alkanoate herbicide contains hydrogen in the 3 position of the pyridine ring. In accordance with the present invention, pyridyloxy or thio phenoxy alkanoate herbicides having a substituent in the 3 position of the pyridine ring other than hydrogen, when combined with benzothiadiazinone herbicides, provide an effective broad spectrum herbicidal combination more selective to soybean plants than the above described herbicidal combination wherein the pyridyloxy or thio phenoxy alkanoate has hydrogen in the 3 position of the pyridine ring. Suitable substituents that can replace hydrogen in the 3 position of the pyridine ring include Cl, F, Br, I, CF3, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy and NO2. Of particular interest is the combination of bentazon with 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid and agriculturally acceptable salts, amides, alcohols, esters including reverse esters and ethers thereof. Also of interest is the combination of.bentazon with 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid and agriculturally acceptable salts, amides, alcohols, esters and ethers thereof. Agriculturally acceptable derivatives of the acids are those salts, amides, alcohols, esters including reverse esters and ethers which possess herbicidal activity while being substantially non phytotoxic to soybean plants.These herbicidal combinations provide broad spectrum weed control in soybean crops while exhibiting less phytotoxicity toward the soybean plants than the combination of bentazon and fluazifop butyl, a pyridyloxyphenoxy propanoic acid ester having hydrogen as the substituent in the 3 position of the pyridine ring. Preferred pyridyloxy phenoxy alkanoate herbicides include pyridyloxy phenoxy propionate compounds of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein X represents Cl, F, Br, I, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, NO2 or CF3 Y represents Cl, F, Br, I, C1 C4 alkyl C1 C4 alkoxy, N02 or CF3 and agriculturally acceptable salts, esters, alcohols, amides or ethers thereof Agriculturally acceptable salts, amides, alcohols, ethers and esters of the above pyridyloxy phenoxy propionates include, for example, compounds of the formulaEMI4.2 wherein X and Y are as hereinbefore defined Z represents CO2H, CO2M, CO2R, COSR, CONR 2, CSNH2, CN, CH2OR or CH2O2CR M represents Na, K, Mg, Ca or R represents C1 C8 alkyl or C3 C6 alkoxyalkyl each R independently represents H or cl C4 alkyl and R independently represents H, C1 C4 alkyl orC2 C3 hydroxyalkyl. Specific pyridinyloxyphenoxy propionate herbicides within the scope of the present invention include, for example 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid and agriculturally acceptable salts, alcohols, esters, amides and ethers thereof 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl pyridyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid and agriculturally acceptable salts, alcohols, esters, amides and ethers thereof methyl 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate butyl 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate ethoxy ethyl 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoro methyl 2 pyridinyloxy phenoxy propionate and l methoxy 2 propyl 2 4 3 chloro 5 tri fluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate methyl 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate butyl 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate ethoxy ethyl 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoro methyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate and l methoxy 2 propyl 2 4 3 fluoro 5 tri fluoromethyl 2 pyridinyl oxy phenoxy propionate. Preferred benzothiadiazinone herbicides include, for example, those of the formula EMI5.1 wherein X represents hydrogen, chloro, bromo, fluoro,C1 C8 alkyl and nitro, and salts thereof. Specifically preferred benzothiadiazinone herbicides include, for example 8 chloro 3 1 methylethyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothia diazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide 8 nitro 3 1 methylethyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothia diazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide 8 fluoro 3 1 methylethyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothia diazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide 8 methyl 3 1 methylethyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothia diazin 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide and 3 1 methylethyl 1H 2,1,3 benzothiadiazinone 4 3H one 2,2 dioxide, commonly known as bentazon. Bentazon, a broadleaf active herbicide and a preferred compound, is a commercially available product sold. under the trade name BASAGRAN. In the practice of the present invention the pyridyloxy phenoxy alkanoate herbicide and the benzothiadiazinone herbicide are formulated into a spray formulation using well known techniques. For example, bentazon, formulated as the water solubleNa salt, is mixed in water and thereafter 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid or an ester thereof, such as the methyl, butyl or ethoxy ethyl ester, is added to the bentazon solution, with agitation, so that a uniform mixture is formed containing both herbicides. .Once prepared the compositions of the present invention are applied to soybean crops employing procedures well known in the art. In one embodiment of the present invention, the Na salt of bentazon is combined with an ester or salt of 2 4 3 fluoro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid in an aqueous spray mixture and applied to soybeans for broad spectrum weed control. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the Na salt of bentazon and an ester of 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl oxy phenoxy propionic acid, formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate, are combined in an aqueous spray mixture in the presence of a surface active agent to facilitate leaf wetting and applied to soybeans for broad spectrum weed control. The exact amount of herbicide applied will vary, depending on many factors, such as, for example, the particular herbicides employed, soil conditions, vegetative conditions, climatological conditions to name a few, and is readily determinable by one skilled in the art. when bentazon, employed as the benzothiadiazinone herbicide, is combined with an ester of 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl oxy phenoxy propanoic acid, employed as the pyridyloxyphenoxy herbicide, the bentazon is used in amounts to provide from 0.5 to 1.5 lbs acre 0.56 to 1.68 kgs ha and the ester of 2 4 3 chloro 5 trifluoromethyl 2 pyridyl oxy phenoxy propanoic acid is present in amounts to provide from 0.03 to 0.5 lbs acre 0.034 to 0.56 kgs ha . The following examples further illustrate the practice of the present invention.Example 1 Various concentrations of fluazifop butyl formulated as a 2 lb gal 0.24 kg L emulsifiable concentrate and bentazon were combined in an aqueous tank mixture which included ORTHO X 77 0.25 vZv brand surfactant. The combination was applied in the field to Giant Foxtail growth stage 4 6 leaf 7.6 12.7 cms in height and soybeans growth stage 3 trifoliate, 8 inches 20 cms in height and evaluated 1 and 2 weeks after treatment for percent control of Giant Foxtail and percent damage to soybeans.Results are listed in Table 1.

B 40 On repeating the procedures described in the above examples employing a combination of benzothiadiazinone herbicides and pyridyloxyphenoxy alkanoate herbicides containing a substituent other than hydrogen in the 3 position of the pyridine ring, substantially the same results are obtained, i.e., less damage to soybean plants when compared to the combination of benzothiadiazinones and pyridyloxyphenoxy alkanoates having hydrogen as the sub stituent in the 3 position of the pyridine ring. In further embodiments, the broad spectrum herbicidal compositions of the present invention can be advantageously employed in combination with one or more additional pesticidal compounds. Such additional pesticidal compounds may be insecticides, nematocides, arthropodicides, herbicides, fungicides or bactericides that are compatible with the compositions of the present invention and non phytotoxic to soybeans when applied thereto. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the additional pesticidal compounds are employed as supplemental toxicants for the same or for different pesticidal uses, or as additaments.
