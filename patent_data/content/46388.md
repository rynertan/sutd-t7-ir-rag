# Multi way loudspeaker system.

## Abstract
A multi way loudspeaker system comprising a plurality of electro acoustic transducers A, B, C wherein any one or more of the said transducers A is arranged in such a way that it operates over two separate frequency bands, and wherein an active transducer B is arranged to operate at frequencies be tween the said two separate bands. Preferably, the attenuation between the two separate bands is at least 20 dB. With a three transducer system this creates thre crossover frequencies.
