## Description
The following copending applications, all filed by the same applicant as the present application, are related to the subject matter of this application, in that they each relate to different aspects of a directory database system. All of the above referenced applications filed concurrently with the present application are incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to directory data distribution systems for distributing such directory data throughout a database network. In the present application the term database network. In the present application the term directory means a table of names and corresponding items of data. Data in a directory is locational or directive in nature, e.g. Distributed database management systems offer users the ability to distribute data and workload among multiple processing sites. ideally, a distributed database management system should support growth while preserving local administrative autonomy and control of access to locally stored data. At the same time, the distributed database should provide its users with a single system image such that, although the data is distributed among several sites, the data distribution is transparent to the users who express their database accesses as though the data is at one place. It is important to preserve the local autonomy of database administrators and users at each site of the distributed database while, at the same time, supporting information sharing among sites. It is to be expected that the equipment supporting the database at different sites will be controlled by different administrative entities. This expectation increases as the entry costs for computing facilities decline. Increased distribution of computing facilities leads to additional requirements for information sharing between sites to support the shared objectives and interests of the users at different sites. Therefore, credible access control mechanisms must be provided to insure isolation, when desired, and to control access to the shared information. At the same time, users must be able to easily access and manipulate remote data as though it were local. The distributed database management system architecture should preserve local control and function when accessing local database objects. The fact that a site participates in the distributed database should not reduce that site s ability to perform local actions on local data by requiring the participation of other sites. Also, data access availability should be a function only of the availability of the site s storing those data objects. The failure of one site should not impact sites which do not reference database objects stored or controlled by the failed site. Finally, it must not be difficult for an existing database site to join the distributed database. It should be fairly easy for an existing database site to establish the ability to access data at another site. The addition of another site to the distributed database must not require a nationwide or global system generation. U.S. Patent 4,468,728 discloses data structure and a search method for a data base management system in which the data structure is arranged in a plurality of search trees. The initial search tree and an initial subset of trees are maintained in a main fast access memory, while the remaining trees are kept in mass memory. An input sear parameter is partitioned into a plurality of subparameters, one for each search tree. The subparameters are used to search a tree in each level of the data structure until the location of a terminating file is determined. An article entitled Object Naming and Catalog Management For a Distributed Database Manager , Lindsay, 1981 IEEE, page 31, describes a system in which distribution of the catalog representation and maintenance leads to an architecture which supports transparent user access to data which may be distributed, replicated, and partitioned among the site of the distributed system. The architecture preserves individual site autonomy while facilitating graceful system growth. There are many ways to distribute directory data through a network. Examples include centralized schemes where a single Directory Service Unit DSU maintains the entire directory. Alternatively, there are local schemes where each DSU maintains a subset of the directory information, and various hybrid schemes which combine local and centralized schemes. The desired attributes of the distribution, the importance of which depends upon the environment of each directory application, are low query update message flows, low storage requirements, fast response to queries, and low susceptibility to failures. The hybrid distribution scheme of the present invention permits the distribution of the directory data among interconnected DSUs. With this scheme, multiple directory applications with different distribution schemes can co exist in a network and still use a common protocol. This scheme allows heterogeneous products to be part of a network and still access directory services. This is the only data distribution scheme that allows multiple directory applications to co exist and use a common protocol without duplication of code. The following definitions of terms used herein are given. Prior to a detailed description of the present invention, the following overview of the environment and elements of the invention are given. The basic structure of the directory database system of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 illustrates the different interfaces or protocol boundaries between the DSU shown at the top of the figure, a data access protocol boundary at the right side of the figure representing the interface between the DSU and the database, and a communications protocol boundary illustrated at the bottom of the figure. The present structure and method is based on a distribution scheme where an instance of directory service may include one or more DSUs. Each DSU may perform one or more directory functions depending upon the product implementation. The directory service system shown in Figure 1 is an installation of a directory functions in a network of interconnected systems. DSS provides the architectural directory services for the user at the API protocol boundary. The participating systems products in a DSS operate coherently under the architected rules as data distribution schemes, naming schemes, search update algorithms, error recovery, synchronization and the like. A DSS is comprised of a collection of directory service units distributed throughout the interconnected system network. A DSU represents the directory service component of a system product for different directory applications, it is the intent that a single DSU can support many applications programs to eliminate duplication. A DSU is composed of a set of functional components called directory service processes DSP to provide the subsetting bases for implementation by products. There are the following four types of DSPs, as shown in Fig. 2, each of which performs distinct functions. The structure and function of these DSPs are described in detail in above cited copending application A2 . In order to obtain full directory service, it is not necessary that every DSU in the system implement all DSPs. For example, a work station may implement only some of the functions and obtain full directory service through interaction with a larger system product. Thus, a DSU may contain all four DSPs or some of the DSPs as necessary to meet the functional needs of each product. A directory database is a database that stores mappings from name to information related to the name. The directory database is the set of directories which contain information of a similar type. There is more than one member in the set if the directory database is distributed across participating DSUs. The directory database members which comprise it are named by way of a directory type ID Directory Identifier . For example, a directory database with directory type ID TELEPHONE may contain name to telephone number mappings. A single DSU may maintain directories of different directory type IDs. However, for any given type ID, a DSU may contain at most one directory. Some examples of directory distribution schemes are as follows In this centralized directory system, there is a single master directory for each directory type ID located whenever a change takes place and directory updating in such a system is relatively easy. However, there are communication costs traffic incurred for each query, since all queries compete for the same resources. In this centralized directory system, once a DSU finds directory data, it can append this data onto its local directory. Thus, subsequent queries for the same data can be satisfied directly from that local directory, thereby reducing the communication cost as well as time for querying the master directory. In this directory system, there is more than one master directory per directory type ID in the system. The degenerated case will be the replicated directory system. In the local system there is no master directory in the system and each DSU maintain its local directory data. When a DSU cannot satisfy the directory request from its local directory, it queries all other directories in the system until the requested data is located. In this local directory system, once a DSU finds the directory data, it can append this data onto its local directory. Thus, subsequent queries for the same data can be satisfied directly from its local directory, thereby reducing communication cost. In a replicated directory system, each DSU in the system has a master directory. The advantage of this system is its fast query response time. The disadvantage of this system is the cost of storing master directory information at each DSU, as well as the communication cost for updating all these directories. For networks up to a few tens of DSUs, a single level primitive distribution scheme described above that is, centralized, localized, and distributed , is usually sufficient. Beyond this number of nodes, hybrid systems combining various primitive distribution schemes in a hierarchial manner, as illustrated in Fig. 5 are attractive. As shown in the drawing, a hybrid directory system in accordance with the present invention includes a replicated directory subsystem containing DSUs A, B and C. This replicated system communicates with an extended centralized directory subsystem containing DSUs 8, 10, 11 and 12. The replicated directory subsystem also communicates with a localized directory subsystem containing DSUs 1, 2, 3 and 4, and with a centralized directory subsystem containing DSUs 5, 6, 7 and 8. The hybrid multiple level design can offer both types of performance improvements over a single level design. The present hybrid directory system is logically divided in subsystems, or regions, made up of any number of distributed directory services. Each subsystem uses different primitive directory distribution schemes to fit into its regional environment. The hierarchial relationships between subsystems are independent of the actual topology of the physical network. The present invention defines a directory distribution scheme that allows co existent operation of many heterogenous products and or applications in interconnected networks.
