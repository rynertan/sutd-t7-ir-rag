# Flexible band positioning device for a read write head.

## Abstract
A flexible band positioning device arranged to convert rotary motion of an output drum 16 of a stepper motor 12 to linear motion of a carriage 13 supporting a read write head 14 . A flexible band 19 is attached to the drum and is at least partially wrapped around it. The end portions of the band 19 are each guided around a different idler roller 25, 27 and are attached to a support frame 15 . The idler rollers are rotatably mounted on the carriage 13 and upon wrapping and unwrapping of the band 19 around the drum 16 , caused by rotary movement of the drum, move the carriage 13 linearly.
