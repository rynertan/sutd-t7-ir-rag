THE PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF 3 LACTAM COMPOUNDS This invention relates to B lactam compounds and in particular to a process for preparing hydroxy substituted lactam derivatives. The invention also relates to novel ss lactam derivatives and to their use as chemical intermediates. J.O Sullivan et al in Biochem J., 1979, 179, 47 52 and Biochem J. 1980, 186, 613 616 report the conversion using cell free extracts of Streptomyces clavuligerus of the compound of formula A EMI1.1 wherein RA represents OCONH2, OCOCH3 or H into the compound of formula B EMI2.1 wherein RA is as described above and RB represents a methoxy group. O Sullivan suggested that the 7 methoxy group originates from an oxygenation at C 7 and methylation of a hydroxylated intermediate, ie the compound of formula B wherein RB is hydroxy, by a methyltransferase. O Sullivan et al. further report that using their enzyme system no evidence was obtained for the incorporation of a methoxyl group into deacetylcephalosporin C, cefuroxime, cephalothin, penicillin N, clavulanic acid or nocardicin A.

Suitably the compound having partial structure I will be in isolated form substantially free of proteinaceous material derived from the oxygenase or other protein present. The salts of the compound having partial structure are a favoured aspect of this invention especially when substantially pure. The salts may be in crystalline or non crystalline form however, the crystalline forms are preferred. When used herein the term substantially pure means at least 75 pure and preferably at least 85 pure, for example, 90 100 pure. The oxygenase enzyme is suitably a dioxygenase of the type wherein one atom of the dioxygen molecule is transferred to each of two substrate molecules. The two substrate molecules may be the same or different.The compound having partial structure 11 serves as one substrate molecule and suitably a molecule such as, for example, 2 oxo glutaric acid serves as a second substrate co substrate molecule. Those enzymes wherein 2 oxo glutaric acid serves as co substrate are preferred oxidases for use in the process of the present invention and are conveniently referred to as 2 oxo glutaric acid coupled oxygenase. From the foregoing it will be appreciated that the oxygenase enzymes utilise molecular oxygen and accordingly to facilitate reaction, preferably the reaction medium should be saturated with oxygen and high oxygen tension maintained over the reaction medium. Efficient transfer of oxygen from the gas phase into the solution phase is assisted by vigorous stirring or shaking of the reaction medium. In addition to co substrate and oxygen the oxidase enzyme reaction mixture will preferably contain a reducing agent such as dithiothreitol, ascorbate or 2 mercaptoethanol and an additional source of iron ions, most suitably as ferrous sulphate. A suitable source of the oxygenase enzyme is that produced by a microorganism. In particular it has been found that microorganisms of the Streptomyces genus, particularly those producing 7 methoxy cephalosporins produce an oxygenase enzyme, which is suitable for the process of the present invention. Preferred oxygenases are those produced by S.wadayamensis, S. lipmanii, S. griseus, S. clavuligerus,S. jumonjinensis and Nocardia lactamdurans. In particular, the following strains of these micro organisms are suitable S. wadayamensis ATCC 21948, S.lipmanii NRRL 3584, S. griseus NRRL 3851, S.clavuligerus ATCC 27064, S. jumonjinensis NRRL 5741,N. lactamdurans NRRL 3802. The oxygenase enzyme may be prepared by culturing the microorganism in a conventional manner, especially under aerobic conditions in a suitable liquid or semi solid medium. In general, carbon and nitrogen sources which microorganisms can assimilate and inorganic salt nutrients essential for the growth of the microorganisms are included in the culture medium.In view of the nature of the prosthetic groups in oxidase enzymes the culture medium will contain a source of iron and where necessary molybdenum ions.The culture conditions may be a temperature of from 200C to 800C and pH of from 4 to 11. Preferred conditions are 200C to 300C at a pH of 5 to 9, suitably about pH7, for 1 to 10 days. The cultured microorganism containing the oxidase may be employed for the process of this invention in the form of the cultured broth, separated cells, or the oxidase may be isolated and used in purified form, partially purified form or as obtained in an impure state as a filtrate from a disrupted cell preparation. Most suitably the enzyme is at least partially purified to remove other enzymes which might catalyse the destruction of the substrate molecules. The enzyme may be employed itself or attached to an insoluble support. The hydroxylation reaction of the present invention is generally carried out in aqueous media, the reaction mixture being maintained in the range pH5 to 8, more suitably 6.5 7.5 preferably about pH7. The pH is suitably controlled using buffers, such as, for example morpholino propane sulphonic acid buffer at pH6.8. The temperature of the reaction should be suitable for the enzyme employed and is generally in the range 150C to 400C preferably ca. 300C. The reaction time depends on such factors as concentrations of reactants, temperature and pH. The enzyme substrate is suitably dissolved in buffer before mixing with the enzyme. The concentration of substrate solution will depend upon the solubility of the substrate suitably the concentration of the substrate solution is in the range of 5 w v.After reaction is complete the enzyme may be separated from the reaction mixture, suitably by acidification, which precipitates the enzyme, and the compound having partial structure I isolated by conventional methods. The initial purification of the derivative conveniently involves an ion exchange followed by a desalting chromatography. In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a lactam having partial structure IV EMI12.1 which process comprises treating a compound having partial structure I with a methylating agent. Suitable compounds having partial structure I include those of formula III hereinbefore. The methylating agent may be chemical or enzymatic preferably the methylating agent is a methyl transferase enzyme. Suitable enzymatic methylating agents include those produced by a microorganism. In particular it has been found that microorganisms of the Streptomyces genus produces a methyl transferase which is suitable for the present process, particularly those species producing 7 methoxy cephalosporins. The methyl transferase may suitably be prepared in a manner analogous to that used for the preparation of the oxygenase enzyme. The enzymic methylation reaction of the present invention is generally carried out in aqueous media, the reaction mixture being maintained in the range pH5 to 8.5, more suitably 7 to 8 preferably from pH7.4 to 7.6. The pH is suitably controlled using buffers, such as, for example morpholinopropane sulphonic acid buffer at pH7.6. The temperature of the reaction should be suitable for the enzyme employed and is generally in the range 150C to 400C preferably ca. 300C. The reaction time depends on such factors as concentrations of reactants, temperature and pH. After the reaction is complete the enzyme may be separated from the reaction mixture, suitably by acidification which precipitates the enzyme and the product isolated by conventional methods. The initial purification of the compound having partial structure IV conveniently involves an ion exchange followed by a desalting chromatography. When the methylating agent is a methyl transferase enzyme the source of the methyl group is suitably S adenosyl methionine. In addition to the source of the methyl group the enzyme reaction mixture will preferably contain a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol or 2 mercaptoethanol. Preferably the compound having partial structure I is not a compound of formula B wherein RA is as hereinbefore defined and RB is hydroxy. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention the reaction of the compound having partial structure II with the oxygenase enzyme, and subsequently the reaction of the compound having partial structure I with the methyl transferase enzyme is carried out in a single reaction mixture without isolation of the compound having partial structure I with the proviso that the B lactam having partial structure I is not a compound of formula B wherein RA is as defined hereinbefore and RB is hydroxy.
