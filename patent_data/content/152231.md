# A CARTON

## Abstract
A carton comprises a body with a top, side walls, an open bottom having one or more closure flaps, and a base having integral feet for raising the carton body above a supporting surface to facilitate lifting thereof. The base comprises a panel foldable into two portions. One of said portions has feet attached thereto and forms an outer skin of said base. The other of said portions is inserted into the carton body during assembly and folded so as to form an inner skin of said base. The closure flap or at least one of said closure flaps is trapped between said inner and outer skins so as to hold said base fixed relative to the body.
