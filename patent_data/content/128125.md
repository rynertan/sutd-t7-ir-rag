# Bolt assembly with a rotating locking bolt head and a floating bolt element for automatic firearms.

## Abstract
In a bolt assembly for inertial operating automatic firearms using the kinetic recoil energy, of the type compris ing a locking bolt head and a floating bolt element with a spring interposed between them, the locking bolt head is a rotatable head having a cylindrical portion 1 and a shank 2 narrowed with respect to the cylindrical portion. The cylindrical portion 1 has two radial crescent shaped diametrically opposite projections 6 , 7 adapted to enagge each an associated groove 12 , 13 provided in the barrel 9 and to disengage therefrom by passing through two associ ated recesses 10 , 11 having a shape corresponding to that of the two crescent shaped projections 6 , 7 of the head. The shank 2 of the locking bolt head is received in a cylindrical bore 21 of the floating bolt element 19 and engages by means of a pin 5 projecting therefrom a helical slot 20 of the floating bolt element 19 . Interposed between the shank 2 of the rotatable locking bolt head and the floating bolt element 19 is a spring 30 . When the arm is locked the projections 6 , 7 of the cylindrical portion 1 of the locking bolt head are in the associated grooves 12 , 13 of the barrel 9 . At firing, at the beginning the floating bolt element 19 , because of its reaction to the recoil of the arm, advances and compresses the spring. Immediately after the spring 30 spreads out and causes the floating bolt element 19 to move back which unlocks the rotatable locking bolt head and causes the pin 5 to slide in the helical slt 20 thus disengaging the rotatable locking bolt head from the barrel 9 and causing the projections 6 , 7 of the cylindrical portion 1 of the head to pass through the two recesses 10 , 11 of the barrel 9 . The arm is thus open and reloads itself automatically in a conventional manner.
