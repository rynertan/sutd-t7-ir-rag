# Irradiation of povidone and povidone iodine.

## Abstract
Povidone is sterilized by irradiation in the presence of iodine and iodide ions. In particular solutions of povidone are sterilized by gamma irradiating the povidone in the presence of iodine and iodide ions, which are present in an amount which prevents gelation at that dose of gamma radiation which would cause gelation in the absence of the iodine and iodide ions. The gamma irradiation of povidone may be effected in the presence of iodine with both iodide and iodate ions or as povidone iodine in the presence of iodide and or iodate ions. Sterilization thus effected by gamma radiation while preventing gelation of the povidone and degradation of the povidone iodine.
