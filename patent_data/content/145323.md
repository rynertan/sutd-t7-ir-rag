## Description
TOUGHENED EPOXY COMPOSITION TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a toughened epoxy resin. Polyepichlorohydrin is utilized in an epoxy component which reacts with a hardener component to produce the resin. More specifically, the present invention relates to the use of liquid polyepichlorohydrin to toughen room temperature cured resins. BACKGROUND ART Heretofore, polyepichlorohydrin elastomer solids have been used in the precision molding of intricate rubber parts since they have a highly fluid nature at elevated temperatures. However, such elastomers have never been utilized in association with room temperature cured epoxy resins. R. S. Drake in an article entitled A Survey of Rubber Toughened Thermosets from Concept toCommercial Use, Proc. Polym. Mat. Sci. Eng. Vol.49, 1983, pages 220 222 traces the history of polybutadiene acrylonitrile elastomers which have been used to toughen or modify thermoplastics and thermosets, for example epoxy resins. Similarly, Alan R.Siebert in an article entitled Morphology andDynamic Mechanical Behavior of Rubber Toughened Thermosets,g Proc. Polym. Mat. Sci. Eng., Vol. 49, 1983, pages 427 431 reviews the work of various persons incorporating low levels of a liquid carboxylic acid terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer to a normally brittle epoxy resin, whereby the crack resistance and impact strength were significantly improved. Bimodal particle systems, phase inversion, adhesive and composite systems, and the like are also discussed. However, none of these references teach or even suggest the use of polyepichlorohydrin in a room temperature cured epoxy resin. Another category of tough structural adhesives is the rubber toughened acrylics. U. S.Patent Nos. 4,051,195 to McWharter 4,117,038 toLehmann and 4,126,504 to Wolinski thus relate to acrylic adhesives. Although Wolinski discloses poly ethers of epichlorohydrin , such compounds are classified as non reactive elastomers. U. S. Patent Nos. 3,966,837 and 4,107,116 to Riew, although containing polyepichlorohydrin, relates to a one component system when reaction of the polyepichlorohydrin only occurs at elevated temperatures. This is in sharp contrast from applicant s invention which reacts at ambient temperature with the hardener, and not the epoxy and further relates to a two component system. Similarly, Sakamoto, U. S. Patent No.3,945,972 relates to the use of polyepichlorohydrin monoglycidyl ether in a reactive diluent prepared by polymerizing epichlorohydrin and methylepichloro hydrin with a monohydric phenol or alcohol and treating the resultant addition polymer with an alkaline substance. Reaction occurs at elevated temperatures apparently with the epoxy and not a hardner. Hence, it is readily distinguished. The remaining patents generally relate to epoxy resins. For example, U. S. Patent No. 4,128, 531 relates to the use of polyfunctional isocyanates, whereas 4,135,037 relates to epoxidized rubbery copolymers and rosin based tackifiers. U.S.Patent No. 4,273,889 relates to a blend of epoxy resins with isopropenyl phenol linear polymers.U.S. Patent No. 4,383,060 relates to an epoxy adhesive containing an imadazole curing agent. U.S.Patent No. 4,397,998 is a rapid curing epoxy composition containing a polyalkylene ether glycol. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an aspect of the present invention to produce a toughened epoxy resin. It is a further aspect of the present invention to produce a toughened epoxy resin, as above, wherein polyepichlorohydrin is utilized in the epoxy component. It is still another aspect of the present invention to produce a toughened epoxy resin, as above, having properties such as excellent adhesion, flexibility, sandibility, and the like. It is a yet further aspect of the present invention to produce a toughened epoxy resin, as above, wherein said polyepichlorohydrin reacts with said hardener through a grafting reaction. It is yet another aspect of the present invention to produce a toughened epoxy resin, as above, wherein optionally an amine terminated butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer is utilized in the hardener component. These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following specification which more fully describes the invention. In general, a two part ambient temperature curing epoxy resin, comprises an epoxy component and a hardener component said epoxy component com prising an epoxy resin and polyepichlorohydrin, the amount of said polyepichlorohydrin being from about 2 percent to about 25 percent by weight based upon the total weight of said epoxy component said hardener component comprising a hardener. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION A toughened epoxy resin is produced from a two part ambient temperature curing epoxy resin formulation having an epoxy component and a hardener component. Polyepichlorohydrin is present in the epoxy component and, upon cure, is chemically incorporated into the resin as through a grafting reaction with either the cured epoxy hardener resin product and or the hardener. The epoxy compound can be conventional compounds such as cycloaliphatic epoxies, epoxidized novolacs, or an epoxy compound derived from an epichlorohydrin and a dihydric phenol. Dihydric phenols are exemplified by resorcinol, hydroquinone, bisphenol A, p,p dihydroxybenzophenone, p,p dihydroxydiphenyl, p,p dihydroxyphenyl ethane, bis 2 hydroxynaphthyl ethane, 1,5 dihydroxynaphthalene with bisphenol A being preferred.A preferred epoxy compound is the diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A DGEBA . Such epoxies are well known to those skilled in the art and generally have epoxy groups on each end with a low molecular weight from about 900 to about 3,000 polymer. The epoxy component conventionally contains fillers and pigments of the type common to the epoxy field with examples of such conventional items in cluding crystalline quartz, bayrtes, magnetite, silicates, aluminum silicates, calcium sulfates, calcium carbonate, talc, titania, clays, barium salts, and the like. Naturally, an amount is utilized depending upon the desired end hardness of the epoxy resin and generally ranges from about 5 to about 80 percent by weight and preferably from about 40 to about 70 percent by weight, based upon the total weight of the epoxy component. Should it be desired that sandibility is not an important aspect of the final epoxy resin, a smaller amount of filler can be utilized, as from about 0 to about 30 percent by weight. Polyepichlorohydrin is an hydroxyl terminated liquid polyether having the fonnulaEMI5.1 wherein m ranges from about 8 to about 48 and preferably from about 15 to about 37. Hence, the polymer has a number average molecular weight of from about 800 to about 5,000 and desirably from about 1,500 to about 3,800. Polyepichlorohydrin is available as Hydrin 10X1 Polymer or Hydrin 10X2Polymer, a trademark of the B. F. Goodrich Company. The amount of polyepichlorohydrin utilized in the present invention ranges from about 2 to 25 percent by weight, and preferably from about 5 to about 15 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the epoxy component. Considering now the hardener component, generally any conventional or common epoxy hardener can be utilized as well known in the art and literature with representative examples including the various aliphatic polyamines, the various polyamides and their derivatives, aromatic polyamines, polymercaptans, polyphenols, polybasic acids, polysulfides, polybasic anhydrides, and the like. The polymercaptans constitute a preferred hardener. Polymercaptans useful in the practice of the present invention are prepared by reacting an allyl ether such as the allyl ether of polyoxypropylated pentaerythritol, or polyoxypropylated sorbitol, with hydrogen sulfide in benzene in the presence of an azo catalyst such as 2,2 azobis 2,4dimethyl valeronitrile at a pressure in the range of 80 to 388 psi and a temperature in the range of 200 to 90 C. A more complete description of the preparation of the polymercaptans used in the practice of the present invention can be found in U. S.Patent No. 4,092,293, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A specific and preferred example is a mercaptan of the following formula EMI6.1 where x is at least 2, and preferably 3, where R is an aliphatic hydrocarbon known to the art and n is at least 1 and preferably 1 or 2. Such a mercaptan is a liquid polymer which imparts rapid cure characteristics to epoxy compounds in combination with various amines and is commercially available as DionDPM 3 800LC, a trademark of the Diamond ShamrockChemical Corporation. Various conventional or common accelerators may be utilized, desirably amine accelerators and desirably tertiary amine accelerators of the formula EMI7.1 where d is an integer of from 1 to 3 inclusive, x is hydrogen or hydroxyl, and y is 1 or 2. Included among such amines are benzyl dimethylamine dimethylaminomethyl phenol dimethylaminoethyl phenol 2,4 di dimethylaminomethyl phenol 2,4,6 tri dimethylaminomethyl phenol alpha methyl benzyldimethylamine. Other amines which are suitable for use in the practice of the present invention include dimethylcyclohexylamine N,N dimethylpiperazine dimethylamino ethanol N methyl diethanolamine triethylamine with diethylene triamine being a preferred amine. The amount of the amine accelerator typically is from about 1 percent to about 20 percent by weight and preferably from about 2 percent to about 10 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the hardener component. Desirably, the hardener component also contains fillers as of the same type and in the same amounts as the epoxy component. Once again, should it be desired that the final epoxy resin need not have good sandibility properties, a lower amount of filler is utilized. The epoxy resin of the present invention can be formed by combining the epoxy component and the hardener component as above described to produce a cure at ambient temperature. In addition to the polyepichlorohydrin in the epoxy component, a second modifier may be utilized in the hardener component.Desirably, the second modifier is a copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile having an acrylonitrile content of from about 5 to about 26 percent by weight and preferably from about 8 to about 18 percent by weight. Preferably, an amine terminated butadiene acrylonitrile polymer is desirable. Specific examples include Hycar Polymer 1300X16 and 1300X21, a trademark of the B. F. Goodrich Company.The amount of the polybutadiene acrylonitrile copolymer ranges from about 2 to about 25 percent by weight and preferably from about 5 to about 15 percent by weight based upon the total weight of the hardener component and the molecular weight ranges from about 3,000 to about 5,000, with from about 3,500 to about 4,800 being preferred. Generally, adequate toughening effects are readily obtained solely through the use of polyepichlorohydrin in the epoxy component and hence the copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile need not be utilized. According to the present invention, since polyepichlorohydrin exists in the epoxy component and the optional butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer exists in the hardener component, a system exists wherein both such rubbery type compounds will not react with their respective carriers, that is epichlorohydrin with the epoxy compound and the polybutadiene acrylonitrile with the mercaptan compound.Hence, the two part epoxy resin system has good shelf stability. However, upon mixing, the epoxy compound will, of course, curingly react with the mercapan compound and the polyepichlorohydrin will react with the hardener. That is, not only does the polyepichlorohydrin graftingly react with the hardener epoxy backbone, but it will also undergo a grafting reaction with the hardener. Should the optional butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer be utilized, it would chemically react with the epoxy. Thus, the polyepichlorohydrin compound would be tied into the cured epoxy yielding a truly toughened system. All such reactions occur at an ambient temperature, that is from about 150 to about 500C, with 0 0 from about 17 to 25 C being preferred. The excess by weight of said epoxy to said hardener is from about 200 1 to about 1 1, with from about 3 1 to 1 1 being preferred. The ratio of the epoxy component to said hardener component is from about 50 1 to about 1 50 with from about 4 1 to 1 4 being preferred. The primary reaction between the epoxy compound and the hardener generally occurs within a few to several minutes, whereas the secondary reaction of the polyepichlorohydrin usually occurs within a 24 hour period. In addition to the above compounds, small amounts of various additives may be added such as colorants, diluents, and the like. The cured epoxy composition of the present invention unexpectedly has a large improvement in toughness and yet maintains excellent adhesion with flexibility comparable to compositions of the same general type of epoxy.The epoxy resin system of the present invention can thus be utilized in any typical epoxy situation, and especially in those situations where an extremely tough and flexible epoxy is needed. Specific uses include a patch or repair for urethane bumpers or as a portion of an automotive door panel, and the like. The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples. EXAMPLE 1 A two part epoxy formulation described below was prepared. The formulation cures on mixing at room temperature to give the following properties after 16 hours of room temperature aging. Tensile shear strength. Solvent wiped mild steel laps ASTM D 1002 64 1600 psi T Peel. ASTM D 1876. Solvent wiped steel 9 pLi The same formulation with the polyepichlorohydrin replaced by a polybutadiene acrylonitrile liquid elastomer, carboxy terminated, exhibited properties of only 300 psi tensile shear and 4 pLi T peel. Thus, the polyepichlorohydrin is acting as a true toughener and is not producing simply a soft epoxy.
