# AIR FILTERING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A pulse cleaning device for a gas filter apparatus including a housing, a partition having at least one row of apertures dividing the interior of the housing into a dirty gas chamber and clean gas chamber, a dirty gas chamber providing ingress for a dirty gas stream into the dirty gas chamber, a clean gas outlet providing egress for clean gas from the clean gas chamber, and a filter secured in flow through relation across each of the apertures. The pulse cleaning device includes a tank supported on a pair of guide rails extending across the clean gas chamber. The tank, which is adapted to be moved back and forth across the width of the clean gas chamber by a chain drive mechanism during pulsing cleaning operations, is provided with pulsing nozzles which are adapted to inject a pulse or jet into each of the apertures as the nozzles come into alignment with them.
