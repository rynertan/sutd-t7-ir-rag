# A SYSTEM FOR PRODUCING FUEL PELLETS

## Abstract
A system for converting selected commercially or in dustrially derived waste materials in a generally dry and friable form, into a pelleted fuel product, comprising an input conveyor 10 , a primary breaker 11 for breaking and reduc ing the incoming materials, a levelling drum 38 , a magnetic drum 43 for extracting ferrous objects from the stream of materials, a shredder 16 from which shredded, cut and screened materials are directed by an air stream into a col lecting bin 18 from which they are fed to a densifier 21 which creates a denser stream of materials to be fed to a pelleting press 22 from which the pelleted fuel product is taken via output conveyor 23 .
