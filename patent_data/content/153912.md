# Apparatus for contactless measurement of temperature.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a measuring apparatus for measuring the temperature of an elongated movable object 8 , for example a wire or wire rod exiting from a draw plate during a wire drawing process. The wire 8 is located in a column like chamber which is defined by two vertical walls 4 and through which an upwardly moving flow of gas passes. A temperature sensor 9 is mounted above and beneath the wire 8 and the temperature difference in the gas is determined with the aid of a differential amplifier 1 . The sensors may be thermistors or preferably thermocou ples, which in the latter case are coupled with counter acting thermo voltages for direct compensation and an output voltage proportional to the temperature difference.
