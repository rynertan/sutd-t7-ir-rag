## Abstract
In initially setting a copying apparatus from a factory at a user s site of installation, an operator first connects the appa ratus to power supply. Thereupon, toner density adjusting means 20 in a developing unit is actuated to adjust the toner content of a developing agent in the developing unit 17 to a predetermined value. Then, a discharge lamp 30 glows, and the surface of a photosensitive drum 14 is charged by a main charger 16 . If the drumsurface is rotated to reach the devel oping unit 17 without being exposed to light, a toner is sup plied from the developing unit to the surface to form a toner layer thereon. When the toner layer reaches the location of a cleaning blade 28 , the blade engages the drum surface to re move the toner layer thereon. Thus, the toner layer serves as a lubricant, enabling the blade to fit well with the drum surface.
