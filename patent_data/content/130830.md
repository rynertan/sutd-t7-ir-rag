# Electrophotographic process.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic process in which an organic photoconductive photosensitive layer 3 chargeable with both positive and negative polarity is subjected to a pro charging by direct current corona discharge for re moving electricity, b main charging by direct current corona discharge of op posite polarity to the pro charging discharge, c imagewise exposure to form an image, d development of the image with toner and e transfer of toner to a transfer sheet 12 wherein the photosensitive layer has a saturation surface po tential of 500 to 700 volts absolute value , the current injected during main charging is sufficient to achieve the saturation sur face potential and the current injected during pro charging is from 40 to 90 of the current injected during main charging.
