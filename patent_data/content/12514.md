## Description
ALKYLATION OF AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS This invention is directed to the catalytic alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly in the liquid phase. Alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds employing certain crystalline zeolite catalysts is known, for instance from U.S. 3,251,897 which describes liquid phase alkylation in the presence of crystalline aluminosilicates such as faujasite, heulandite, clinoptilolite, mordenite, dachiardite, zeolite X and zeolite Y. The temperature of such alkylation procedure does not exceed 315.550C 6000F. , thereby maintaining the operating phase substantially liquid. U.S. 2,904,607 describes alkylation of hydrocarbon compounds in the presence of crystalline metallic aluminosilicates such as magnesium aluminosilicates. U.S. 3,631,120 and 3,641,177 describe liquid phase processes for alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with olefins in the presence of certain zeolites. U.S.3,631,120 discloses use of an ammonium exchanged, calcined zeolite having a silica to alumina mole ratio of between 4.0 and 4.9. U.S. 3,641,177 discloses use of a zeolite catalyst activated in a particular manner. U.S. No. 3,755,483 discloses that the vapor phase reaction of propylene with benzene and toluene in the presence of zeolite ZSM 12 proceeds with high catalyst and activity selectivity to yield isopropylbenzene and isopropylmethylbenzene, but with operation in the vapor phase with relatively high temperatures and pressures, thereby promoting dealkylation and olefin decomposition which is especially evident when the alkylating agent comprises an olefin of three or more carbon atoms. A process has now been discovered whereby aromatic hydrocarbons, containing either polar or non polar substituents, may be successfully alkylated with olefins or alcohols containing from one to five carbon atoms. Surprising and substantial increases in product yield, conversion and selectivity are obtained by operating at lower temperatures than heretofore and essentially in the liquid phase. This increase is especially evident when alkylating agents of three or more carbon atoms where higher temperatures promote dealkylation and olefin decomposition are used. According to the present invention a process for the alkylation of an aromatic hydrocarbon compound comprises contacting such compound with an alkylating agent having from one to five carbon atoms, preferably in the liquid phase, at a temperature between 1000C and 3000C and a pressure between 105 N m2 and 2 x 107 N m2 in the presence of a catalyst comprising a zeolite having a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index from 1 to 12. The process is advantageously carried out at a temperature between 2000C and 2500C. A suitable aromatic alkylating agent mole ratio is the range 20 1 to 1 1. The process is usually operated at a WHSV with reference to total catalyst of 0.1 to 100. The aromatic hydrocarbon may bear a polar or non polar substituent and the preferred alkylating agent is an olefin, particularly one having at least three carbon atoms. Alcohols however, are also favoured alkylating agents. The zeolite is preferably ZSM 12 and in many applications the zeolite is composited with a binder. The significance and manner of determination of a zeolite s constraint index 1 has been widely described in the Patent literature, for instance inBritish Specification 1,446,522. The Constraint Index approximates the ratio of the cracking rate constants for the two hydrocarbons.Zeolites suitable for the present invention are those having a Constraint Index of 1 to 12. Constraint Index Cl values for some typical zeolites are ZEOLITE C.I. ZSM 5 8.3 ZSM 11 8.7 ZSM 12 2 ZSM 23 9.1 ZSM 35 4.5 ZSM 38 2 TMA Offretite 3.7 Beta 0.6 ZSM 4 0.5 H Zeolon mordenite 0.4 REY 0.4 Amorphous Silica Alumina 0.6 Erionite 38 The nature of this parameter and the technique by which it is determined admit the possibility that a given zeolite can be tested under somewhat different conditions and thereby have different ConstraintIndexes. Constraint Index seems to vary somewhat with severity of operation conversion and the presence or absence of binders. Therefore, it will be appreciated that it may be possible to so select test conditions to establish more than one value in the range of 1 to 12 for the Constraint Index of a particular zeolite. Such a zeolite is to be regarded as having a Constraint Index of 1 to 12.Also contemplated herein as having aConstraint Index of 1 to 12 and therefore within the scope of the novel class of highly siliceous zeolites are those zeolites which, when tested under two or more sets of conditions produce a value of the ConstraintIndex slightly less than 1, e.g. 0.9, or somewhat greater than 12, e.g. 14 or 15, with at least one other value within the range 1 to 12. The preferred zeolites are exemplified byZSM 5, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, identified respectively by the x ray data presented inU.S. 3,702,886, 3,709,979, 3,832,449, 4,076,842, 4,016,245 and 4,046,859. The specific zeolites described, when prepared in the presence of organic cations, are substantially catalytically inactive, possibly because the intracrystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 54O0C for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 5400C in air.The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of this type zeolite however, the presence of these cations does appear to favor the formation of this special class of zeolite. More generally, it is desirable to activate this type catalyst by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination in air at about 5400C for from about 15 minutes to about 24 hours. Natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to this type zeolite catalyst by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination, in combinations. Natural minerals which may be so treated include ferrierite, brewsterite, stilbite, dachiardite, epistilbite, heulandite, and clinoptilolite. In a preferred aspect of this invention, the zeolites hereof are selected as those having a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, of not less than about 1.6 grams per centimeter. The significance and manner of determination of crystal density are also described in the aforesaid British Specification 1,446,522. Crystal framework densities of some typical zeolites, including some which are not within the purview of this invention, are Void Framework Zeolite Volume Density Ferrierite 0.28 cc cc 1.76 g cc Mordenite .28 1.7 ZSM 5, 11 .29 1.79 ZSM 12 1.8 ZSM 23 2.0 Dachiardite .32 1.72 L .32 1.61 Clinoptilolite .34 1.71 Laumontite .34 1.77 ZSM 4 Omega .38 1.65 Heulandite .39 1.69 P .41 1.57 Offretite .40 1.55 Levynite .40 1.54 Erionite .35 1.51 Game lignite .44 1.46 Chabazite .47 1.45 A .5 1.3 Y .48 1.27 When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite is conveniently converted to the hydrogen form, generally by intermediate formation of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium ion exchange and calcination of the ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form.In addition to the hydrogen form, other forms of the zeolite wherein the original alkali metal has been reduced to less than about 1.5 percent by weight may be used. Thus, the original alkali metal of the zeolite may be replaced by ion exchange with other suitable ions of Groups IB to VIII of the Periodic Table, including, by way of example, nickel, copper, zinc, palladium, calcium or rare earth metals. In practicing the desired conversion process, it may be desirable to incorporate the above described crystalline zeolite in another material resistant tc the temperature and other conditions employed in the process. Such matrix materials include synthetic or naturally occurring substances as well as inorganic materials such as clay, silica and or metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McMamee Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite.Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification. In addition to the foregoing materials, the zeolites employed herein may be composited with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica alumina, silica magnesia, silica zirconia, silica thoria, silica berylia, silica titania as well as ternary compositions such as silica alumina thoria, silica alumina zirconia, silica alumina magnesia and silica magnesia zirconia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of zeolite component and inorganic oxide gel matrix on an anhydrous basis may vary widely, with the zeolite content ranging from between about 1 to about 99 percent by weight and more usually in the range of about 5 to about 80 percent by weight of the dry composite. Exemplary of the hydrocarbons which may be alkylated by the process of this invention are aromatic compounds such as benzenes, naphthalenes, anthracenes, and the like and substituted derivatives thereof and alkyl substituted aromatics, e.g. toluene, xylene, and homologs thereof. In addition, other non polar substituent groups may also be attached to the aromatic ring, including by way of example methyl, ethyl, t butyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl and aryl. Aromatic hydrocarbons which may be alkylated by the present process likewise include those having polar substituents on the aromatic ring or on a side chain attached thereto. Non limiting examples include phenol, cresols and halogenated aromatics. The preferred alkylating agents are olefins, formaldehyde, alkyl halides and alcohols. Numerous other acyclic compounds having at least one reactive alkyl radical may be used. The process may be carried out as a batch type, semi continuous or continuous operation utilizing a fixed, fluidized or moving bed catalyst system. A preferred embodiment entails use of a fluidized catalyst zone wherein the reactants are passed concurrently or countercurrently through a moving fluidized bed of the catalyst. The fluidized catalyst after use is conducted to a regeneration zone wherein coke is burned from the catalyst in an oxygen containing atmosphere, e.g. air, at an elevated temperature, after which the regenerated catalyst is recycled to the conversion zone for further contact with the reactants.Subsequent to leaving the reaction zone, the desired products may be recovered from the reactor effluent, for instance by distillation, and the unreacted hydrocarbons recycled for reuse in the process. The following examples illustrate the process of this invention without limiting the scope or utility thereof. The catalyst in all cases comprised 4.6 gms ofZSM 12 prepared as disclosed in U.S. 3,832,449 and consisted of 65 wt 7o HZSM 12 and 35 wt Al203 binder.The reaction products were analyzed with a gas chromatograph equipped with a hot wire detector.Positive identification of the various compounds was made with GC MS, IR, and or NMR.Example 1 Benzene was alkylated with methanol at 2500C.and atmospheric pressure using HZSM 12 extrudate as catalyst. At this relatively low temperature 90 of the methanol was converted to benzene alkylation products. Table I shows the product selectivity and also the isomer distribution of the methylbenzenes that were produced. Reactor temperatures from 2000C to 3O00C were explored. Below about 2400C there was a rapid decline in methanol conversion and at 2000C the conversion was essentially zero. Above about 2600C no additional alkylation products were formed. The main alkylation products were toluene and xylenes. The xylene fraction, formed by alkylation of the toluene, amounted to 15 of the total product and was unusual in that the ortho isomer predominated. The actual isomer distribution was 47 ortho, 40 meta, 13 para. Using unmodified HZSM 5 U.S. Patent No.3,702,886 as catalyst and similar experimental conditions, the xylene isomer ratio was 22 ortho, 54 meta and 249o para. Since the methylation of toluene is ortho directing it would appear that the initially formed ortho isomer is only partially isomerized byHZSM 12 whereas with HZSM 5 isomerization to equilibrium occurs.

This is illustrated in Example 11 with toluene propylene.Example 11 Cymene isopropyltoluene , the product of toluene propylene alkylation, is of commercial interest as a large volume chemical intermediate for cresol manufacture. Of the three isomers, meta cymene has the greatest potential value and ortho cymene the least value. Because of the high potential for immediate commercial application, the reaction parameters of toluene propylene alkylation with HZSM 12 were studied in depth to optimize meta cymene production. The variable that most affected selectivity to meta cymene was found to be temperature. This is illustrated in the following Table V TABLE V TOLUENE PROPYtENE AtKYLATION HZSM 12 CATALYST Isopropyltoluene Isomer Distribution Temp.

Propylene conversion at 230 2400C averaged 90 95 during a 5 day run. The only indication of a decrease in catalyst activity was a change in isomer distribution versus time on stream. This was denoted by a decrease in the meta isomer and an increase in the para and ortho isomers.Examples 12 15 Alkylation of ethylbenzene with methanol, propylene, butenes and isobutylene, respectively, in the present of ZSM 12 catalyst, is summarized in Table VI.

As can be seen in Table VI, selectivity for total ethyltoluene was 64 . Of this 64 the isomer ratio was 47 ortho, 34 meta and 19 para. This isomer distribution is similar to that obtained by alkylating toluene with ethylene over HZSM 12. The alkylation of ethylbenzene with propylene was found to proceed smoothly at 2000C and atmospheric pressure. Propylene conversion was 95 and the selectivity to isopropylethylbenzene was 90 . Operating in the liquid phase, butene conversion was 95 with 90 selectivity to butylethylbenzene. 1 butene or 2 butene alkylated to produce secondary butylethylbenzene. The isomer ratio was 6090 para and 40 meta at the temperature used for the experiment. No ortho isomer was found. At the same operating conditions isobutylene alkylated to give identical olefin conversion and selectivity to product as was found. with 1 butene or 2 butene. The isomer ratio of the tertiary butylethylbenzene was 90 pars and 10 meta. This ratio is close to the 92 8 ratio obtained with conventionalFreidel Kraft catalysts, but conversion and selectivity are higher with HZSM 12. Examples 16 19 The alkylation of isopropylbenzene overHZSM 12 is summarized in Table VII.

At 2000C disproportionation of the isopropylbenzene was the predominate reaction.The product was 41 diisopropylbenzene, 24 benzene and 20 isopropyltoluene. Part of the benzene was alkylated as shown by the presence of 6 toluene. The meta or para isomers of diisopropylbenzene can be oxidized to the corresponding dihydroperoxides and subsequently rearranged with an acid catalyst to make resorcinol, hydroquinone and acetone. Resorcinol has the potential of becoming a large volume chemical for use in thermosetting plywood laminates if the selling price could be substantially reduced. Because of this the alkylation reaction parameters of isopropylbenzene propylene were studied to determine if the meta isomer could be selectively produced. At 2000C and atmospheric pressure, the meta para ratio was 40 60 as shown in Table VII.Increasing the reactor temperature to 2350C reverse this and the meta para ratio became 61 39. A further increase in the temperature did not improve the meta para ratio beyond 61 39. The ortho isomer was not found. However, this is a difficult chromatographic analysis and it is possible 2 3 could have gone undetected. Cumene isopropylbenzene can be alkylated with butenes at 2000C. The reaction must be carried out in the liquid phase to prevent catalyst deactivation. Conversion of the olefins was 95 with 95 selectivity. The 1 and 2 butenes alkylated to produce secondary butylcumene and isobutylene gave tertiary butylcumene. Example 20 Experimentally the alkylation of xylene with methanol was limited to the ortho isomer because only two trimethylbenzene isomers should be formed, assuming an absence of isomerization. These are 1,2,3, and 1,2 4 trimethylbenzene. Any 1,3,5 isomer would require an isomerization step. Table IX lists reaction parameters and isomer distribution for the experiment. Using a 1 1 molar ratio of o xylene methanol the ratio of 1,2,3 to 1,2,4isomer was 1 1. Only 2 of the 1,3,5 isomer was present. With the conditions of this experiment, little isomerization of either the o xylene or the trimethylbenzenes occurred. Increasing the reactor temperature to 3500C resulted in an almost equilibrium mixture of the alkylation products.

Under these conditions only ortho xylene gave a significant alkylation product. These results are not consistent with published relative alkylation rates of the xylene isomers and propylene. Operating in the liquid phase with a low WHSV might induce alkylation with all isomers. The two major alkylation products formed from o xylene and propylene were 1,2 dimethyl 4 isopropyl benzene and 1,2 dimethyl 3 isopropylbenzene. The ratio of these compounds was 93 7. Using a liquid catalyst ofBF3 H3P04 it has been reported these compounds were found in a ratio of 96 . During the experiments with o xylene essentially no isomerization of the xylene was noted.With meta and para xylenes as the temperatures was increased to force alkylation, isomerization occurred and the only alkylation product was that associated with o xylene. The experimental conditions and product selectivity for xylene butene alkylation experiments are shown in Table X. With the indicated reaction conditions only ortho xylene could be appreciably alkylated. Example 22 At 2000C and 2169.76 kPa 300 psig o xylene was alkylated with l butene or 2 butene to make l,2 dimethyl 4 sec butylbenzene with 96 selectivity.Conversion of the olefin was 95 . Example 23 At 1900C o xylene was alkylated with isobutylene to give 1,2 dimethyl 4 t butylbenzene. The selectivity was 97 and conversion of the olefin 95 .The reaction was maintained for 48 hours without a decline in catalyst activity.Examples 24 26 Halogenated aromatics are difficult to alkylate because of the deactivating effect of the halogen upon the aromatic ring. However, using HZSM 12 as catalyst it was possible to non selectively alkylate chlorobenzene with methanol or ethylene. The results are shown in Table XI. In each instance, the ortho isomer is the major product. TABLE XI CHLOROBENZENE ALKYLATION OVER H2SM 12 CHLOROBENZENE ALKYLATING ALKYLATING AGENT CONVERSION PRODUCTS EXAMPLE AGENT TEMP.

This reaction was exceptional because 95 of the propylene was converted to isopropylchlorobenzene with a selectivity of 99 .This compares to published data which indicate aluminosilicate or H2S04 catalysts gave approximately 85 conversion of the propylene. In the case of H2S04, the published isomer distribution was 80 ortho, 20 para. The meta isomer was not found. With HZSM 12 as catalyst the isomer ratio was 60 para, 20 meta, 20 ortho.

It is shown to be selective for ethylation reactions, but overall conversions are lower than those encountered with ZSM 5 catalyst.Example 27 Benzene was alkylated with propylene in the presence of HZSM 12 catalyst to show the effect of temperature on the reaction. Keeping the benzene propylene feed and the pressure substantially constant, the reactor temperature was varied from 100o 3000C and the reaction products analyzed for changes in composition. The parameters and results are given in TableXIV.
