Examples of the 3 to 6 membered cycloalkyl group are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. Cyclopropyl and cyclohexyl are preferred. R3 and R4 may be bonded to each other to form a 5 or 6 membered carboxylic ring together with the carbon atom to which they are bonded. Examples of such a carbocyclic ring are a cyclopentane ring, a cyclohexane ring, a 3,3 ethylenedioxy 5,5 dimethylcyclohexane ring, and a 3 oxo 5,5 dimethylcyclohexane ring. With regard to the description of R3 and R4, the C1 25 alkyl groups including C1 10 alkyl and C15 alkyl may be interrupted by O , S or NZ8 in which z8 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1 10 alkyl group .Examples of the C1 1 25 alkyl interrupted by such a hetero atom will be understood from the following Examples.

In the definitions of formula I or in the above preferred embodiments, some of the compounds of formula I are excluded from the scope of the invention by attaching the provisos. When in formula I R and R4 are simultaneouslyHO or HOOC, or RÚ and Rê simultaneously represent the groupEMI15.1 in which Zê is a hydrogen, the compounds of of formula I are unstable and at least cannot be isolated. When in formula I , R3 and R4 simultaneously represent HS, C1 25 alkylthio, phenyl C1 25 alkyl thio, or alkylEMI16.1 or R3 is HO and R4 is a hydrogen O atom, or RÚ and Rê simultaneously repesent NO2, halogen or C1 25alkoxy or alkylthio, the compounds do not meet the objects of this invention because they have weak or insufficient herbicidal activity or their herbicidal activity is exhibited slowly.

The a,ss unsaturated compound of formula I can be produced by any one of the following methods according to specified groups of RÚ, Rê, R and R4.These methods are known per se.

When a compound of the following formulaEMI28.1 is used instead of the compound of formula a in the third method, alpha ,ss unsaturated compounds of the following formula corresponding to formula I in which R is a halogen atom can be obtained.EMI28.2 tb halogen tb SEP SEP b tb Alcoholysis or thioalcoholysis of the compounds of formula b or the compounds of formula b can give a,ss unsaturated compounds of formula I in which R1 is an alkoxy or alkylthio group having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, or a,B unsaturated compounds of formula I in which R3 represents Z5X , a phenyl Cl 25 alkylthio group or a phenylthio group. A fourth method is the hydrolysis of the product obtained by the second method, which yields an a,B unsaturated compound of formula I in which R4 isHO or HS. By reacting the resulting compound in whichR4 is HO with an acyl halide such asEMI28.3 , un saturated compounds in which R4 isEMI28.4 can be produced.A fifth method is a method for producing compounds of formula I in which R3 isEMI28.5 or R4 andR2 are bonded to each other to form an acid anhydride group. This method is schematically shown as follows EMI29.1 provided that R3 is notEMI29.2 By treating in a customary manner, the final 2. 6 compound in which R is CO2 obtained by the above re O action, a compound of formula I in which R4 and R2 are bonded to each other to form an acid anhydride group is produced. The a, ss unsaturated compounds represented by formula I show excellent herbicidal activity and are used for combating weeds. The weeds herein denote useless or hazardous plants which grow in environments created by man such as paddies and upland farms after they have come into these environments from the surrounding nature. Examples of the weeds include plants of the family Gramineae such as those of the genera Digitaria,Sorghum and Echinochloa plants of the family Plantaginaceae such as genus Plantago plants of the familyCyperaceae such as those of the genus Cyperus plants of the family Compositae such as those of the genus Erigeron plants of the family Cruciferae such asBarbarae vulgaris and those of the genus Raphanus plants of the family Solanaceae such as those of the genus Physalis plants of the family Commelinaceae such as those of the genus Commelina and plants of the family Leguminosae such as those of the genus Medicago. The active compounds in accordance with this invention greatly affect the growth of plants, and therefore can control the growth of plants when applied in amounts smaller than those normally used in controlling weeds although the amounts may vary depending upon the kinds of the active compounds. The active compounds of this invention can be applied to weeds or their habitat at a rate of 10 g to 200 kg, preferably 50 to 100 kg, per hectare. The active compounds of this invention may be used in usual types of formulations such as solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, suspensions, dusts, pastes, or granules. These formulations may be prepared by using one or more of various adjuvants, for example, solid carriers such as talc, bentonite, clay, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, white carbon, vermiculite, slaked lime, ammonium sulfate and urea liquid carriers such as water, alcohols, dioxane, acetone, xylene, cyclohexane, methylnaphthalene and dimethylformamide surface active agents, emulsifiers, dispersants and stickers such as alkyl sulfates, alkylsulfonic acid salts, ligninsulfonic acid salts, polyoxyethylene glycol ethers, polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ethers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoalkylates, and dinaphthylmethanedisulfonic acid salts and various other adjuvants such as carboxymethyl cellulose and gum arabic. These formulations may be prepared, for example, by mixing the active compound with a carrier and or an emulsifier exemplified above. The active compound of this invention can be present usually in an amount of 0.01 to 99 by weight, preferably 0.1 to 95 by weight, in such a formulation. The active compound of this invention may be applied singly or as a mixture with another active compound or in each of the formulations exemplified above to plants by usual methods such as spraying, atomizing, scattering and dusting. The active compounds of this invention are characterized by being rapidly absorbed from the stalks or leaves of weeds and rapidly exhibit their herbicidal activity or plant growth modifying activity. The active compounds of this invention include those which exhibit excellent activity against annual weeds, those which exhibit excellent activity against parennial weeds as well as annual weeds, and those which exhibit selective strong activity against one of an annual broad leaved weed and an annual narrow leaved weed. The following Examples illustrate the present invention in more detail. All parts in these examples are parts by weight.The herbicidal activity of each herbicide was evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5 wherein 1 means that weeds were as alive as they had been before the application of the herbicide 5 means that weeds entirely withered as a result of applying the herbicide and 2, 3 and 4 mean varying degrees of the weakened states of weeds between 1 and 5.Preparation Example Some active compounds in accordance with this invention were prepared, and their physical properties are shown in Table 1.

mixed to form a wettable powder which was diluted with water to a predetermined concentration.Example 1 The active compounds of this invention indicated in Table 2 were formulated in accordance with the above Formulation Examples. Seeds of the weeds indicated in Table 2 were sown, and after emergence, grown for 2 to 3 weeks. Each of the formulations containing the active compounds of this invention was applied to these weeds three times at an interval of about 30 minutes in all amount of about 0.5 to 1 g m for each application as the amount of the active ingredient. Thereafter, without applying the formulation, the weeds were grown for one week. The results are shown in Table 2. Annual fleabane Erigeron annus is an annual broad leaved plant fingergrass Digitaria sanguinalis is an annual narrow leaved plant broadleaf plantain Plantago asicatica is a perennial broad leaved plant and nut grass Cyperus rotundus is a perennial narrowleaved plant.
