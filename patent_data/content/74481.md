# Sheet set finishing apparatus for forming sets from documents from a document reproduction machine.

## Abstract
Documents fed serially from a document reproduction machine 10 are fed by a vacuum belt feed system 21 to sheet accumulation and stapling system 22. When at the registra tion position in system 22, the leading edge of each sheet has passed output bin 14, and the trailing portion is supported either by platform 16 or sheet sets thereon. After a set is accumulated in system 22, it is stapled and then ejected back into bin 14.
