# Variably charged hydraulic circuit.

## Abstract
A hydraulic fluid circuit system is provided for use in a vehicle and having a priority 30 and a second fluid circuit 40 therein. A variable displacement pump 10 is the primary fluid source for the priority circuit 30 , and a fixed displacement pump 20 is the primary fluid source for the second fluid circuit 40 . A demand valve 50 responsive to differential fluid pressure between the priority circuit 30 and the output of the variable displacement pump 10 selectively switches increasing amounts of output from the fixed displacement pump 20 into the priority circuit 30 in proportion to the output of the variable displacement pump 10 . The demand valve 50 includes a three positioned spool valve. The priority circuit 30 may include a hydraulic steering system, and the second fluid circuit 40 may include an implement or accessory circuit.
