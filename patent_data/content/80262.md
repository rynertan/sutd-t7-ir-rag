# Ball and socket joints.

## Abstract
A ball and socket joint particularly for use as a steering rack end joint which comprises a ball pin 16 the ball of which is located in a cup shaped bearing 15 housed in a socket 10 . The socket comprises a tubular housing 21 and a screw head 11 and the tubular housing has an internal shoulder 19 for abutment with the screw head 11 . The bearing cup 15 is trapped between tubular housing 21 and the screw head and dimensioned so as to exert a control load on the ball 17 , the shoulder 19 preventing assembly loads being applied to the bearing cup 15 .

## Claims
Claims 1. A ball and socket joint having a cup shaped socket 10 formed from a tubular member 21 , a bearing cup 15 located in the socket 10 and a ball pin 16 , the ball 17 of which is mounted for rotation in the bearing cup 15 and the shank 18 of which extends through the mouth 23 of the socket POX and the base of the socket 10 is formed by a screw head 11 , characterised in that the wall of the tubular member 21 has an internal shoulder 19 for abutment with the screw head 11 and an end portion 22 which is deformed around the screw head 11 to lock the screw head 11 between the shoulder 19 and said end portion 22 . 2. A joint as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the bearing cup 15 is a one piece cup supporting the ball 17 on both sides of an equatorE E thereof.

## Description
BALL AND SOCKET JOINTS This invention relates to ball and socket joints, e.g. for motor vehicle steering linkages. A known ball and socket joint comprises a cup shaped socket formed from a tubular members a bearing cup located in the socket and a ball pin, the ball of which is mounted for rotation in the bearing cup and the shank of which extends through the mouth of the socket, and the base of the socket is formed by a screw head. Such a joint will hereinafter be called a joint of the kind referred to and an example is shown in GB 1 344 878. In the above patent specification the tubular socket is pressed onto the screw head to compressively load the bearing cup therebetween to a predetermined degree, and the tubular socket is then swaged over the screw head to lock the socket in position on the screw head. The preload bearing establishes a desired torque resistance for movement of the ball in the bearing cup. In this illustrated joint the torque load is applied to the joint during assembly of the socket onto the screw head and the only control to the amount of preload on the ball is that applied by assembly apparatus, i.e. the assembly machines are set to exert a controlled load on the bearing during assembly of the joint. The present invention provides a joint of the kind referred in which the bearing cup exerts a preload on the ball and in which any preload is not directly applied by loading the bearing cup between the socket housing and the screw head. Accordingly there is provided a ball and socket joint of the kind referred characterised in that the tubular socket member has an internal shoulder for abutment with the screw head, and an end portion which is deformed around the screw head to lock the screw head between the shoulder and said end portion. An advantage of this type of construction is that the ball of the ball pin can be matched with a given cavity size in the bearing cup to achieve the desired torque load on the ball. The internal shoulder on the tubular member then prevents any assembly load being exerted on the bearing cup when the end portion of the tubular member is deformed around the screw head. This ensures that the torque loads exerted by the selected bearing cup on the ball are more predictable. The invention will be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawing which is a longitudinal section through a motor vehicle steering rack end joint. The joint has a screw head 11 having a threaded stud 12 thereon for attachment to a vehicle steering rack not shown . An alternative connection with the steering rack would be a screw threaded cavity. The external surface of the screw head 11 has flats 13 thereon for the application of a spanner when screwing the joint onto a rack. The screw head 11 has an end face 14 thereon which provides a seat for a bearing cup 15. The ball pin 16 has a ball 17 and a shank 18. The ball 17 is mounted for rotation in the bearing cup 15 which supports the ball on both sides of its equator E E, and the shank 18 extends through the mouth of the cup. The bearing cup 15 is illustrated as a one piece snap over bearing moulded from Nylon 6, 66, or acetal resin, or alternatively could possibly be made from a two part cup. The bearing cup 15 is located in a cu p shaped socket 10 formed from a screw head 11 and a tubular housing 21 having a spherically shaped mouth 23 which co operates with a like surface on the exterior of the bearing cup to retain it in the surround. The shank 18 projects through the mouth 23 of the surround and the other end portion 22 of the housing 21 has an internal shoulder which is level with the bottom face 20 on the base of the bearing cup 18.The shoulder 19 and bottom face 20 present a continuous face when the ball pin and cup 15 are assembled in the tubular housing 21. The end face 14 of the screw head 11 abuts the so formed continuous face to hold the bearing cup in place and the end portion 22 is deformed around the screw head to clinch the shoulder 19 hard against the end face 14. The torque control load exerted on the ball 17 of the ball pin is due to the match between the size of the bearing cup 15, the ball 17, and the tubular housing 21. The bearing cup 15 is made slightly oversize for the defined space between the housing and ball in which it is to be located so as to exert the desired control load on the ball. The shoulder 19 prevents any compressive loads from being applied to the bearing cup 15 when the housing 21 is fitted over the screw head 11 and therefore the torque control load on the ball 17 is not governed by assembly process parameters.
