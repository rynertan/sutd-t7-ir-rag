# MIXED STEREOISOMERS OF FENVALERATE

## Abstract
A new form of an enantiomer pair of stereoisomers of fen valerate comprising S α cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl S 2 4 chlorophenyl isovalerate and the R R enantiomer as a crys tal of characteristics crystal system monoclinic lattice constants a 11.90 Å, b 5.60 Å, c 32.58 Å, β 93.0 space group P₂ 1 c density 1.28 g cm³ number of molecules in unit lattice 4. A process of preparing the enantiomer pair or the fenva lerate rich in the enantiomer pair comprises depositing said crystals from a solution of a racemate of fenvalerate. Another process of preparing the enantiomer pair comprises deposi ting the crystals from a solution of the fenvalerate rich in the enantiomer pair and separating the crystals from the liquor.
