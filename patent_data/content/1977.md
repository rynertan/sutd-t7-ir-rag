# Soluble multifunctional lithium containing initiators and their use in a process for polymerisation.

## Abstract
Organic liquid soluble multifunctional lithium containing initiators are prepared by reacting an organo lithium compound with an organic compound containing at least one group of the configuration 1,3 bis 1 phenylethenyl benzene. Such initiators can be prepared in the absence of polar solvents and are very desirable for the polymerization of dienes such as butadiene to a desirable 1,4 configuration.
