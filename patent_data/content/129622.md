## Description
TRIHALOMETHANE PRECURSOR REMOVAL USING IONEXCHANGE EMULSIONS. This invention is concerned with trihalomethane precursor removal using ion exchange emulsions. The ubiquitous use of chlorine as a disinfectant in public water supplies has introduced a subtle health hazard of its own. Chlorine has been shown to react with humic substances present in such waters to produce trihalomethanes THM such as chloroform.The Environmental Protection Agency has identified trihalomethanes as carcinogens in animals, and has published a maximum contaminant level of 0.10 mg liter 100 ppb for total THM in community water systems National Interim Primary Drinking WaterRegulations Control of Trihalomethanes in DrinkingWater Final Rules. U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, Federal Register, Vol. 44, No. 231,November 29, 1979 . Attempts at removing trihalomethanes from chlorinated drinking water have met with but limited success. If THM is removed, but residual chlorine and humic substances remain, the THM will re form. If the active chlorine is removed, as with granular activated charcoal, the water must be re chlorinated to meet standards, and THM again may re form. An alternative approach is to remove the huic substances that are THM precursors. These substances are found in many natural waters, are probably leached from organic materials found in soil, and are usually found at high concentrations in surface waters, and at lower concentrations in most ground waters. Materials that previously have been used for removing them fro water include adsorbents such as granular activated carbon, coagulants such as alum and ferric sulfate, and conventional ion exchange resins, especially weakly basic anion exchange resins. Each of these processes shares the problem that relatively large amounts of treating agents must be added to the drinking water to effectively reduce the THM precursor levels to below permissible limits.In addition, each possesses additional problems of its own, some of which are described above. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to minimize the amount of treating agent tnat st be added to water to significantly reduce its T precursor content. Another object is to remove THM precursors in a way that does not interfere with conventional drinking water disinfectant processes.Additional objects will become apparent upon consideration of the following disclosure. We have discovered a process for retroving the precursors of trihalomethane from water, and especially from drinking water containing such trihalorrethane precursors, which comprises treating the water with submictoscopic ion exchange resin particles having a diameter smaller than about 1.5yam. The submicroscopic ion exchange particles may be anion exchange particles alone, or anion exchange particles combined with cation exchange particles in the form of a floc. These submicroscopic ion exchange particles are surprisingly effective in removing THM precursors, and are effective at surprisingly low concentrations.It would have been expected that for effective treatment removal of THM from drinking water as much as 50 milligrams resin per liter of water mg l would be required. However we have unexpectedly found that the preferred level is 1 to 25 mg l, preferably about 20 mg l or less, more preferably about 15 ,g l or less, and still more preferably about 10 mg l or less. A convenient process by which water such as drinking water may be treated according to the process of the present invention is to introduce the submicroscopic anion exchange resin in the form of an emulsion, or to introduce a water suspended floc of the anion and cation exchange resins, into the water prior to the settling and filtration treatment normally given to waters during purification for drinking purposes. It is beneficial to combine coagulant treatment and treatment with the submicroscopic anion exchange resin. Coagulant treatment is a well known water treatment process the coagulants used are similarly well known and include soluble polyelectrolytes, which may be cationic, anionic or nonionic polyelectrolytes, including polyacrylic acid and soluble, polymeric quaternary amines. The coagulants may also be metal salts, including the sulfates and chlorides of aluminum, ferrous and ferric iron, magnesium carbonate and aluminum silicates including clays. Other coagulants will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The coagulant treatment may occur prior to, simultaneous wIth, or subsequent to treatment with the submicroscopic anion exchange resin it should preferably occur prior to any filtration step. In the absence of a coagulant or flocculant that will flocculate any excess submicroscopIc cation exchange resin, either present in the water prior to treatment or introduced as described above, the resin may pass through subsequent filters and produce turbidity. Treatment with a soluble catlonlc flocculant or sub icroscopic cation exchange resin mlay be necessary to prevent this turbidity. The conventional settling and filtration step removes the flocculated resin, and with it the . P precursors, from the water.Chlorination or other dIsInfectant processes may be applied at any point during the water treatment, but desirably the disinfectant sold be introduced subsequent to treatment with, and more desirably subsequent to removal of, the subricroscopic ion exchange resins. Chlorination prior to treatment with the submicroscopic ion exchange resin allows the TH.R precursors to react with the chlorine prior to their removal, thus felting the purpose of the present process, and hlcrination prior to removal of the submicroscopic ion exchange resin allows the resin itself to react with the chlorine. The consequence of the latter reaction is unknown, but inasmuch as it introduces chlorinated organic materials to the drinking water, it is considered undesirable. The submicroscopic ion exchange particles used in the process of the present InventIon are those resins having a diameter of 1.5 lulm or smaller, and bearing ion exchange functional groups. The level of Ion exchange functionality surprisingly has only a limited effect on the ability of these particles to remove ThtM precursors, and resins with as few as about 0.2 functional groups per monomer unit have almost the same effectiveness in T precursor removal as those with one functional group per monomer unit.The preferred range of functionality of these resins is from about 0.1 to about 1.5 functional groups per monomer unit, a more preferred range is from about 0.2 to about 1.5 functional groups per monomer unit, and a still more preferred range is from about 0.2 to about 0.55 functional groups per monomer unit. Such submicroscopic ion exchange resins may be prepared as taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,200,695 Resins suitable for use in the present invention include those prepared by functionalizing emulsion copolymers, and those prepared by copolymerizlng monomers which Include at least one rionomer containing anion exchange functional groups, preferably amine functional groups.The latter process produces anion exchange resins directly, without the need for a subsequent functionalization step, although the 2mine containing resins are frequently quaternized to convert weakly basic anion exchange resins to strongly basic ones. These processes are known to the skilled practitioner. The following examples are intended to illustrate the present invention, but not to limit it except as it is limited in the claims. All reagents used are of good commercial qualIty, and all percentages and other proportions are by weight, unless otherwise indicated. In the following examples, samples of raw water were treated according to the process of the present invention, and for comparative purposes, according to conventional processes. Raw water was collected from the Delaware River at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, filtered through a coarse screen, and subsequently filtered through glass wool prior to testing. Raw water was sampled by the U.S. Entircnmentai Protection Agency from the Ohio River at Cincinnati, Ohio, and from the Preston Water Treatment Plant at Rialeah, Florida these samples were tested as supplied. The experimental procedure used was similar for each of the following examples. For the small scale examples the material to be tested was added to 800 ml of the specified test water in a 1000 ml beaker. The submicroscopfflc ion exchange resins were added as aqueous suspensions containing 6.25 solids, and the other TXM precursor removers were added as dry solids. The water containing the T i precursor removers to be tested was stirred for 5 rinses at 100 rpm using a Phipps and Bird jar test apparatus, and for an addItional 20 minutes at 30 rpm, after which the water was allowed to stand undisturbed while the solids settled.At 30 and 60 minutes during the settling period the turbidity of the water was determined using a Rellige Turbidimeter and APHA Method No. 163b APHAStandard Methods, 13th edition, 1971 if a simple containing the submicroscopic anion exchange resin still showed turbidity after 60 minutes of settling, a small amount of submicroscopic cation exchange resin was added to flocculate the excess anion exchange resin. Subsequent to the settling period the water samples were filtered using Whatman 1 filter paper. Several 50 ml samples of the treated, filtered water were chlorinated to dIfferent levels of chlorine, using an approximately 4000 6000 ppm stock solution of chlorine gas dissolved in water these chlorInated samples were allowed to stand In the dark for 24 hours, after which they were analyzed for chlorine spectrophotometrically using A Method No. 114g PPMA Standard Methods, 13th edition, 1971 , to determine the sample containing a residual chlorine content of 1.0 1.5 ppm chlorine after 24 hours.The sample containing this specified amount of chlorine after 24 hours was treated with 0.25 ml of 0.1N sodium thlosulfate to reduce the free chlorine and prevent further chlorination during analysis. The T formed during the 24 hour period was determined using a gas liquid chromatograph with electron capture detector, direct injection of the aqueous sample, and similar injection of aqueous chloroform standards. Examples 1 29, the results of which are given inTable 1, illustrate the removal of THM precursors, as evidenced by the reduction in tEM hollow nag overnight chlorination, by a strongly basic, submicroscopic anion exchange resin of the present invention, in the hydroxyl form. In Examples 1 10 and 23 29 the tested waters were samples of Delaware river water, inExamples 11 16 they were settled Ohio river water, and in Examples 17 22 they were raw waters from the PrestonWater Treatment Plant In Pialeah, Florida.

In the preceding examples and following Examples 62 64, the emulsion resin used was a styrene based copolymer crosslinkd with divimylbenzene, chloromethylated, amlnated and quaternized according to the procedures set forth in U.S.Patent 4,200,695. In the rest of the following examples the resins are prepared accordIng to the procedures set forth in the same U.S. patent, but they differ in composition as follows The resins used In Examples 65 70 were styrenebased copolymers erosslinked with dlvlnylbenzene and functionalized by copolymerizing a functional group bearing monomer with the above monomers. The resin used in Examples 65 67 contained 48 by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers, of dimethylamincethyl methaprylate, which incorporated an average of approximately 0.38 functional amine groups per monomer unit into the polymer.The resin ofExample 68 70 contained 60 , on the basis described above, of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, or an average of approximately 0.5 functional emine groups per monomer unit. The resin used in Examples 71 73 was a copolymer of methyl methacrylate crosslinked with divinylbenzene and functionallzed subsequent to polymerization with dlmethylaminopropyl methacrylate to a level of approxImately 0.22 functional groups per monomer unit, based on the original copolyrrer.The resin used in Examples 74 76 was functionalized by polymerizing 47 by weight, based on the total weight of monomers, of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate with methyl methacrylate and the crosslinking monomer ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, to produce a resin vine an average of approximately 0.41 functional groups per monomer unit. The tested waters for Examples 62 76 were raw water samples from Dayton2 Beach, Florida when chlorinated without preatment, according to the procedure described above, the water used inExamples 62 70 contained 387 g l of trihalomethanes, and that used in Examples 71 76 contaIned 399 g l of trihalomethanes i.e., these are the control values analogous to those so labeled In Tables 1 7 . Table 8 gives the results of Examples 62 76, which illustrate the effectiveness of resins having relatively low functionality Examples 55 76 compared with a resin having a functionality about the same as those of Examples 1 61 Examples 62 64 , when used to treat similar water samples.
