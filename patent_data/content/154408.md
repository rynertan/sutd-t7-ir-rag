# Process for producing antimony containing oxide catalyst with improved strength.

## Abstract
A process for producing an antimony containing oxide catalyst with improved strength is described, by the steps of preparing a slurry containing an antimony compound, a polyvalent metal compound and a silica sol as the essential ingredients, adjusting the pH of the slurry to 7 or less, heat treating the slurry at a temperature of 40 C or higher, and thereafter drying the slurry and calcining the dried particles, wherein said slurry is irradiated with ultrasonic waves during the pH adjustment, or after the pH adjustment and before completion of the heat treatment.
