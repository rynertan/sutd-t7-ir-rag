## Description
SPECIFICATIONTitle of the invention Feed additive or feedField of the art The present invention relates to a feed additive comprising at least fatty acid salt or a feed compising said feed additive, and relates to a feed additive comprising at least saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt or a feed comprising said feed additive, for animals, such as livestocks, poultries, fishes etc.. Background of the art Using feeds for animals have been promptly changed in recent years from using mainly self supplying feeds to using formula feeds produced in modern factories in consideration of the amounts of nutrients required by intended animals, animal growth promotions, animal health maintenances etc. to result in a very high ratio. of the use amounts of formula feeds to the total use amounts of all feeds nowadays. For such formula feeds, it is generally employed to use, as supplemental ingredients, various additives, such as amino acids, minerals, vitamins, enzymes, antibiotics etc.with various objects, such as nutrient replenishment, nutrient fortification, improvements of digestion and absorption, growth promotion, disease prevention etc., besides main ingredients, such as cereal grains, oil seed meals, chaffs and brans, fish meals, oils and fats etc.. One of the most desired objects in the producions of livestocks and poultries and in the fishes cultivations etc. is to produce livestock, poultry and fish products efficiently in a shorter period and also in less amounts of feeds. Antibiotics have hitherto been mainly used to achieve such an object. However, the uses of antibiotics are now in question because it is apprehended that careless uses of antibiotics for feeds may accelerate the apperances of bacterIa with drug resistance and that the remaftzngs and transferings of antIbiotics into the human body may cause allergies or the changes of enteric bacterial flora.Therefore, antibiotics have now a tendency to be used under the limitations or the reductions of the kins, the use amounts or the use terms etc. of antibiotics. Accordingly it is now expected that novel very safe feed additives or feeds will be provided which will be able to improve the productivities of livestock, poultry and fish products under no necessity of the frequent uses or the much use of drugs, such as antibiotics etc..Disclosure of the invention The present inventors continuous research has attained the facts that a feed additive comprising at least fatty acid salt or a feed comprising said feed additive referred to as a feed simply hereinafter , and a feed additive comprising at least saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt or a feed comprising said feed additive referred to as a feed simply hereinafter can show excellent effects on the improvements of feed efficiencies, growth promotions, health maintenances etc. for various animals, such as livestocks, poultries, fishes etc.. The facts described above have produced the present invention. Describing in passing, it is known that a feed compris ing saccharide fatty acid ester, especially sucrose fatty acid ester, promotes the growths of specified animals, such as young cattle, young pigs etc.. That effect is however insufficient. The present inventors have first found that the very combination use of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt can give a very remarkable effect to many kinds of animals. The present invention is explained in detail hereinafter. The typical examples of the animals covered by the feed additive or the feed of the present invention are enumerated as follows livestocks, such as beef cattle, dairy cattle, young cattle, pigs, young pigs, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, dogs, cats etc. poultries, such as chicken domestic fowls, laying hens, seed cocks, domestic ducks, geese, turkeys, quails, small birds etc. fishes, such as eel, carps, ayu, trouts, rainbow trout, yellowtail, sea bream, silver salmon, gold fishes, colored carp, tropical fishes etc. shellfishes crustaceans animals for fur, such as mink etc. laboratory animals, such as mice, rats, hamsters etc.. The typical examples of fatty acid salts in the present invention are enumerated as follows alkali metal salts, such as lithium salts, sodium salts, potassium salts etc. alkaline earth metal salts, such as magnesium salts, calcium salts, barium salts etc. various metal salts, such as zinc salts, aluminum salts, iron salts, manganese salts etc. ammonium salts organoamine salts, such as monoethanolamine salts, diethanolamine salts, triethanolamine salts etc. basic amino acid salts, such as lysine salts, ornithine salts, arginine salts, histidine salts, hydroxylysine salts, etc., and most of all, alkali metal salts, ammonium salts and basic amino acid salts are usually used in general. Fatty acids with about 6 24 carbons are usually suitable as the component part of fatty acid salt. Both of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are usable. Both of fatty acids with a strait carbon chain and fatty acids with a branched carbon chain are usable. Fatty acids with one or more of substituents, such as hydroxyl group, are usable. Fatty acids are not necessarily monobasic acids, and dibasic acids etc. are also usable. Fatty acids are not restricted to fatty acids derived from natural materials, such as oils or fats etc.. Synthetic fatty acids are also usable which are produced by the liquid phase catalytic oxidations of paraffins, the carbonylations of M olefins oxo method , the carboxylations of branched olefins Koch s method or other methods.The typical examples of such fatty acids are enumerated as follows caproic acid, enanthic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, tridecanoic acid, 2 methyltetradecanoic acid, 5 methyltetradecanoic acid, 2,2 dimethyltetradecanoic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, ricinoleic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, erucic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, 1,20 eicosamethylenedicarboxylic acid etc.. The fatty acid salts described above are respectively usable alone and the mixtures of two or more kinds of fatty acid salts of which fatty acid parts are different or of which cation parts are different, are also usable as in the case of using alone. The typical examples of saccharide fatty acid esters in the present invention are esters of fatty acid with 6 24 carbons and monosaccharide or oligosaccharide. The typical examples of such saccharides are enumerated as follows arabinose, xylose, ribose, lyxose, ribulose, xylulose, glucose, galactose, talose, mannose, fructose, sorbose, tagatose, psicose, maltose, isomaltose, cellobiose, gentiobiose, trehalose, lactose, sucrose, maltotriose, gentlanose, raffinose, stachyose etc.. Nonoesters, polyesters, such as diesters, triesters, tetraesters etc. and the mixtures of twc or more of them are usable monoester has one ester linkage in one molecule of saccharide fatty acid ester polyester has two or more ester linkages in one molecule of saccharide fatty acid ester. Among such esters, monoesters, diesters and triesters are usually preferable. Among the saccharide fatty acid esters described above, sucrose fatty acid esters are examples of the saccharide fatty ac esters which are most suitable in the present invention, since they are easily available and also considerably low priced owing to the industrial mass productions. The fatty acids described above concerning fatty acid salts are usable as the fatty acid part of saccharide fatty acid ester. The saccharide fatty acid esters described above are usable alone and the mixtures of two or more kinds of saccharide fatty acid esters of which saccharide parts are different or of which fatty acid parts are different, are also usable as in the case of using alone. Such fatty acid salts and saccharide fatty acid esters can be easily produced by known methods, and ones produced by any method are usable in the present invention. Fatty acid salts can be easily produced by known methods, for example, by reacting fatty acid or fatty acid ester, for example, fatty acid methyl ester, fatty acid ethyl ester, fatty acid glyceride etc. with oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogencarbonate of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal etc., basic amino acid, ammonia or organoamine etc., or by other methods. The fatty acid salts produced in advance by the abovedescribed methods etc. are not necessarily used. For example, it is employable to treat as follows fatty acid and oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogencarbonate of alkali metal, ammonia or basic amino acid etc. are used in the free state each so that fatty acid salt may be prepared in a feed additive or a feed to result in providing the feed additive or the feed of the present invention. The typical examples of processes for preparing saccharide fatty acid esters are enumerated as follows 1 saccharide and fatty acid lower alkyl ester, for example, fatty acid methyl ester, fatty acid ethyl ester etc. are subjected to the alcoholysis using fatty acid salt, for example, fatty acid sodium salt, fatty acid potassium salt etc. and a basic catalyst in the presence of water or solvent, for example, propyleneglycol etc. 2 saccharide and fatty acid methyl ester, fatty acid carbitol ester or fatty acid glyceride mono , di and triglyceride etc. are subjected to the alcoholysis in the presence of fatty acid salt, for example, fatty acid sodium salt, fatty acid potassium salt etc. 3 saccharine and oil or fat, that is, fatty acid triglyceride are subjected to the alcoholysis in the presence of a basic catalyst 4 saccharide is reacted with fatty acid chloride or fatty acid anhydride. Among these processes, 1 , 2 and 3 are very advantageous, because the crude products prepared by these processes contain saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt usually, fatty acid alkali metal salt and in addition the crude products being able to be economically prepared are usable for the feed additive or the feed of the present invention without purification, namely, as they are. In the case of the combination use of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt in the present invention, the suitable use amount ratio by weight of saccharide fatty acid ester to fatty acid salt in the feed additive or the feed of the present invention is usually in the range of 97 3 to 3 97, preferably 95 5 to 5 95, most preferably 90 10 to 10 90. The present invention does not necessarily require the fatty acid salts and the saccharide fatty acid esters purified to a high degree. The present invention can use the fatty acid salts and the saccharides fatty acid esters accompanied by one or more of the substances highly safe for the living body, such as saccharides, fatty acid loweralkyl esters, fatty acid glycerides mono , di and triglyceride , fatty acids, alkali metal carbonates, basic amino acids etc. which remain owing to partial unreaction or may remain in the production of fatty acid salt or saccharide fatty acid ester as in the case of the crude saccharide fatty acid ester described above, and byproducts, such as alcohol, glycerin etc.. In the case of using fatty acid salt without being accompanied by saccharide fatty acid ester for the feed additive or the feed of the present invention, the use amount of fatty acid salt is usually 0.001 20 by weight, preferably 0.01 10 by weight, most preferably about 0.02 5 by weight to the ar cunt of the feed containing ingredients other than fatty acid salt being finally given to animals, such as livestocks, poultries, fishes etc., though the use amount of fatty acid salt varies with the factors, such as the kinds of the intended animals, the ages of the intended animals, the kinds of ingredients other than fatty acid salt and the mixing ratio of them etc.. And in the case of the combination use of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt for the feed additive or the feed of the present invention, the total use amount of sacoharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt is usually 0.OC1 20 by weight, preferably 0.01 10 by weight, most preferably about 0.02 5 by weight to the amount of the feed ccntaining ingredients other than saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt being finally given to animals, sucn as livestocks, poultries, fishes etc., though the total use amount of the both varies with the factors, such as the kinds of the intended animals, the ages of the intended animals, the kinds of ingredients other than the both and the mixing ratio of them etc.. In the case that use amounts described above are less than the lowest limit values, it becomes difficult to show the effect 0 the present invention, and the uses of the amounts exceeding the highest limit values described above do not show any specific effect and are rather uneconomical, so that such uses are not desirable. In the cases of the single use of fatty acid salt and the combination use of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt, the feed additive of the present invention is usable In the form of the single use of fatty acid salt as it is or in the form of the combination use of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt as these mixture is, or in the form of the aqueous solution or the aqueous suspension etc. prepared by diluting it or these mixture with water.Further, various materials are usable as a diluting agent for it or these mixture described above in the feed additive of the present invention in the same manner as in the uses of known additives, such as vitamins, minerals, enzymes etc. , which various materials are enumerated as follows wheat flour, starch, dextrin feed materials being widely used, for example, cereal grains, such as corn, milo kaoliang etc. chaffs and brans, such as rice bran, deoiled rice bran, wheat bran etc. oil seed meals, such as soybean meal, rape seed meal, cottonseed meal, linseed meal etc. or oils and fats, such as beef tallow, soybean oil, palm oil, coconut oil, fish oil etc.. Usually the feed. additive of the present invention is finally. added into feed and mixed to give to animals. The feed additive of the present invention is able to be given to animals in the form of the drinking water prepared by diluting it with water. On the other hand, the feed of the present invention is prepared by mixing the feed additive described above with one or more of materials being widely used for feeds in this industrial field, for example, cereal grains, such as corn, wheat, barley, rye, rice, oat, milo kaoliang etc., chaffs and brans, such as rice bran, deoiled ricebran, wheat bran etc., oil seed meals, such as soybean meal, rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal etc., fish meals, fish solubles, skim milk, whey, molasses, oils and fats, such as yellow grease, tallow, soybean oil, palm oil, fish oils etc. roughages, such as rice straw, dried grasses, silages etc..The feed is further optinally added with additives which are, for example, as follows amino acids, such as methionin, lysine, tryptophane, threonine, glycine etc. vitamins, such as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K etc. choline nicotinic acid nicotinic acid amide sodium chloride minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus etc. enzymes, such as protease, amylase, cellulase, lipase etc. emulsifiers such as soybean lecithin, propylene glycol fatty acid ester esters, glycerin fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene glycerin fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters etc. hormones chemical preservatives aromas polyhydric alcohols, such as propylene glycol, glycerin etc. sugaralcohols, such as sorbitol, manmitol etc. saccharides, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose etc. caking agent synthetic antibacterial agents, antibiotics etc.. Feed materials and feed additives other than fatty acid salt and saccharide fatty acid ester in the feed additive or the feed of the present invention do not have any specific limitation in point of kind, mixing ratio etc. and are properly selected and used. However, there is generally a tendency that the present invention shows an outstanding effect in case that protein, or oil or fat has its high content in a feed given finally to animals. In recent years people have been taking a growing interest in using oil or fat oil or fat source as an energy source in a feed more than the conventional use amount of oil or fat in order to reduce the use amounts of protein sources being feed materials, such as fish meal etc.. The present invention shows an excellent effect also in the use of such a feed having a high content of protein and a low content of oil or fat. Further, as described later, the digestions and absorptions of all nutrients in the feed are promoted to result in the improvement of the feed efficiency owing to fatty acid salt or owing to the synergism of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt in the case of the combination use of the both. Therefore, the present invention can obtain the animal growth results equal to or superior to those of conventional feeds even in the case of feeds on a nutritive level lower than conventional feeds. The feed additive or the feed of the present invention is usable in optional forms, such as powder, granule, pellet, crumble, cube, half wetted, paste etc.. Both of fatty acid salt and saccharide fatty acid ester are very useful as an energy source in the feed additive or the feed of the present invention. Further, the digestions and absorptions of all nutrients, such as oil or fat, pro tein etc. in the feed are improved to result in the growth promotions of animals, such as livestocks, poultries, fishes etc., in the improvement of feed efficiencies and in other effects owing to the action of fatty acid salt in the case of using it alone or owing to the synergism of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt in the case of the combination use of the both there is such a case that a remarkable improvement effect of feed efficiency though the increase in animal body weight is almost equal to that in the case of conventional feeds, the feed intake is considerably lowered to result in the remarkable improvement of feed efficiency is mainly shown under certain conditions, such as the kinds of intended animals, the nutritive levels of given feeds etc.. . Describing in passing, though it is known that a feed comprising saccharide fatty acid ester, especially sucrose fatty acid ester, promotes the growths of young cattle, young pigs etc., the single use of sacoha ride fatty acid ester can not show a sufficient effect.A very excellent efficiency can be shown by the combination use of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt. Further, the feed additive or the feed of the present invention gives desirable influences also on health maintenances, physical strength developments etc. for animals, such as livestocks, poultries, fishes etc.. Further, the combination use of saccharide fatty acid ester and fatty acid salt can show an emulsifying power, especially an oil in water O W type emulsifying power, far superior to that in case of using saccharide fatty acid ester alone, Therefore, when the present invention is applied to the substitute milk usually powder , of which main ingredients are skim milk and oil or fat, for suckling and young mammals, such as young cattle etc., the present invention shows not only the physiological properties described above, but also other effects, such as the shortening of the time for suspending or dissolving the substitute milk into water or heated water, the remarkable improvement of the homogeneity stability of the substitute milk solution etc. in the case of preparing the substitute milk solution by adding water or heated water into the substituted milk. Furthermore, it has been known that fatty acid salt and saccharide fatty acid ester are very safe for the living body and therefore the feed additive or the feed of the present invention is quite out of the question in point of safety. As described above, the feed additive or the feed of the present invention has a high utility value owing to the combination of a very high safety and an excellent efficiency.
