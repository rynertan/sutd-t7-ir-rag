## Description
The present invention relates to a clamp structure for storage batteries,provided with a quick operating device. As is knows, the clamp members for coupling electrical cables to the terminals of storage batteries are generally formed by a Jaw body1 which encompasses the battery terminalMand which is clamped by means of a tols member to be operated by a wrench or the like. That configuration involves a comparatively long time for clamping and opening the clamp itself. This ract is a particularly important one in the case therein the battery has to be quickly disconnected, for example in the case of shorts through the electric system, susceptible to cause great overheatings, because of the great current flowing through the wires. With the known solutions great damages may occur to the electric system, because of the mentioned long time necessary tor the disc√≤nnection. Accordingly, the task of the present invention is to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, by providing such a clamp structure for storage batteries which may be coupled to the battery terminal, and disconnected therefrom, in a very short time,without the need of using any tools or means. Within the above mentioned task, it is a main obJect of the present invention to provide such a clamp structure which, without using any tools or means,may be firmly clamped on the battery terminal, in such a way as to assure a precise and even electric contact. Another object of the present invention is to provide such a clamp structure for storage batteries, which is provided with a quick operating device vvhich, owing to its constructional features is effective to assure a safe and reliable operation. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a clamp structure which may be made starting from easily available elements and materials and which, in addition, is of a comparatively low cost. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide such a clamp which may be fitted to different size terminal storage batteries. According to one aspect of the present invention, the above task and ob ects,as well as yet other objects which will become more apparent thereinafter, are achieved by a clamp for storage batteries, provided with a quick operating device, comprising a jaw body to be coupled to a terminal of the storage battery and rigid with a sleeve member to be fixed to an electric cable, characterized in that it comprises, at the ends of the jaw body two throughgoing seats provided with opposite threads and effective to be coupled to oppositely threaded portions of a clamping tie rod. Further characteristlcs and avantages of the present invention will become more apparent thereinafter from the following detailed description of a clamp structure for storage batteries with a quick operating device,being illustrated, by way of an indicative but not limitative example in the accompanying drawings, wilere fig.l is a perspective schematic view illustrating the clamp structure according to the present invention, before the coupling thereof to a terminal of a storage battery fig.2 is a top view illustrating the clamp structure according to the invention as applied to the battery terminal and fig. illustrates a top view showing the clamp structure according to the invention in the disconnecting step from the battery terminal. With reference to the figures, the clamp structure for storage batteries provided with a quick operating device according to the present invention, which is indicated overally at 1, comprises a jaw body 2 which, as is conventional,has a substantially circular shape with an interrupted portions at two ear formations 3,parallely spaced from one another. Rigid with the jaw body 2,there is provided a sleeve member 4 thereto an electric cable 6 may oe couplea,by means of screws ,tor coupling the storage battery to the electric system. A main teature of the invention is that, at the ear formations 3,arranged at the ends of the jaw toay 2, there are formed throughgoing seats 10, having oppositely directed threads, which are axially aligned. The mentioned threaded seats, 10 engage with oppositely threaded portions, indicated at 11, which are wormed on a tie rod element, indicated overally by the reference number 12. The provision of a double threaded coupling between the tie rod 12 and jaw body 2,is such that, as the tie rod 12 is rotated,a double spread apart effect on the jaw body is obtained, because of the spreading apart of a jaw leg and the spreading apart of the other Jaw leg. Likewise,during the closure step,a quicker clamping will be obtained, In order to open and close the clamp, without the need of using tools, with the tie rod 12,prererably made of a single piece, there is coupled a handle lever 13, which radially extends with respect to the tie rod and provides a long lever arm in order to provide a proper force both during the clamp opening step and during the closing step of said clamp 1 on the terminal 20 of the storage battery. savantageously,e lever 13 may be coated by a thermally insulating material, in order to assure to the user the greatest safety and comfort as the clamp has to be disconnected, for example because of a short in the electric system. Advantageously, the tie rod element 12 is provided with threads effective to afford the possibility to pass from the opened condition to the fully closed condition, by a rotation through substantially 180 . As is shown in figure l,in order to connect the clamp, the jaws of the jaw body z are held in a spaced away condition and then, after having applied it on the battery terminal, the clamp will be closed by turning the lever. In order to disengage the clamp, as it is shown in figure 3, it will be sufficient to rotate the lever in the opposite direction, in such a way as to cause said jaws to immediately disengage from the terminal 20. oreover,the provision of a threaded engagement between the ends of the jaw body z and tie rod,causes,during the disconnection step, said jaw body to be also disengaged rrom the terminal 20. In practicing the invention, the used materials provided that they are compatible with the intended use,as well as the size and specific shapes,may be any, according to requirements.
