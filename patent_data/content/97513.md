# Cementiferous compositions.

## Abstract
This invention provides cementiferous compositions having improved flow characteristics which are given by the incorporation of certain hydroxy estercopolymers. The copolymers include those of acrylic or methacrylic acid with a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and are used preferably in the range 0.01 to 2.5 w w on the cement in the cementiferous composition. This invention also provides novel additive compositions for use in the cementiferous compositions which, in addition to the copolymer, also contain an anti foaming agent.

## Description
CEMENTIFEROUS COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to cementiferous compositions and to additives for use in such compositions, which improve the physical characteristics such as the flow and workability of such compositions. The cementiferous compositions with which this invention is concerned include concretes which comprises cement, coarse and fine aggregates and water cement pastes which comprise cement and water, and mortars which comprise cement, sand and water lime, sand and water, or mixtures containing both lime and cement. The invention is also applicable to high pressure, steam cured concretes comprising cement, aggregate and water lime or limestone and siliceous materials such as silica flour and water. The additives with which this invention is concerned are sometimes referred to as plasticisers for concrete.Their purpose is to improve the flow characteristics of the cementiferous compositions containing them so that they may be pumped or effectively poured to fill all the spaces in a mould or other structure and yet not have their strength characteristics weakened by the inclusion of excessive amounts of air which, in certain circumstances, would be undesirable. In addition, these additives can be used to design cementiferous compositions with a reduced water content. This permits the production of concretes having higher compressive strength when cured and also adequate flow properties for certain applications. Various additives for use in cementiferous compositions have been previously proposed, including for example, lignosulphonates and sodium naphthalene sulphonate formaldehyde condensates. Details of such materials are set out in Chemical Admixtures forConcrete by M R Rixom, published by E and F N SponLimited, London, and by the Halstead Press, a division ofJohn Wiley and Sons Incorporated of New York, USA, where, at page 34, various known additives are considered. Various polymeric materials have been evaluated as plasticiser additives for cementiferous compositions and it has been found that certain copolymers and their soluble salts comprising polymerisable carboxylic acids and the hydroxy alkyl esters of such acids have particular merit in this application. This invention provides a cementiferous composition comprising, as a plasticiser additive, a copolymer, or soluble salt thereof, comprising from 50 to 95 mole of an ethylenically polymerisable carboxylic acid and from 5 to 50 mole of a hydroxy alkyl ester of an ethylenically polymerisable carboxylic acid. The additives may conveniently contain an anti foaming agent, alternatively known as an air detraining agent. Suitable agents include tributyl phosphate, dibutyl phthalate, various water insoluble alcohols and silicone derivatives. In accordance with a further aspect of this invention, there is provided a plasticiser additive composition comprising an aqueous solution of a copolymer or soluble salt thereof, comprising from 50 to 95 mole of an ethylenically polymerisable carboxylic acid and from 5 to 50 mole of a hydroxy alkyl ester of an ethylenically polymerisable carboxylic acid, and an effective amount of an anti foaming agent. Preferably, the amount of anti foaming agent in the composition is in the range 0.1 to 2.0 by weight of the copolymer or salt thereof. Suitable acids include acrylic, methacrylic, crotonic, maleic, fumaric, itaconic, citraconic, and or aconitic acids and like ethylenically unsaturated acids.The preferred acids are acrylic, methacrylic, and maleic acid, with acrylic or methacrylic acids being most preferred. Suitable esters include the hydroxy ethyl, hydroxy propyl, and like esters of the above acids. The preferred are those having up to C8 hydroxy alkyl groups, most preferably hydroxy propyl acrylate. Preferred copolymers include copolymers of acrylic acid and hydroxy ethyl acrylate or methacrylate and of acrylic or methacrylic acid and hydroxypropyl acrylate or methacrylate. The most preferred copolymer is that of acrylic or methacrylic acid and hydroxy propyl methacrylate. Preferably the mole percentage of the acrylic acid in the copolymer is in the range 60 to 85 mole . Absolute molecular weight of the copolymers of this invention have not been determined. However, apparent molecular weights as calculated relative to polyethylene glycol standards have been determined, using gel permeation chromatography.The apparent molecular weight of the copolymer may be varied over a wide range, the preferred range being 1000 to 15000, more preferably 1000 9000. Precise molecular weights have not been determined for all the copolymers used but in some cases viscosity determinations have been carried out. The preferred viscosity is less than 30 cps as a 15 by weight aqueous solution in 1 molar NaCl. The amount of hydroxy alkyl acrylate copolymer or soluble salt thereof used in the cementiferous compositions is preferably in the range 0.018 to 2.58 by weight on the cement in the cementiferous composition. Suitable copolymers may be made by the copolymerisation of the hydroxy alkyl acrylate or methacrylate with the acrylic acid or other appropriate comonoErs, using methods known in polymerisation technology. The resultant copolymer may be neutralised with a suitable base such as sodium hydroxide or other soluble base and diluted with water to the required concentration for use in the cementiferous compositions and plasticiser additives provided by this invention.

These materials were evaluated as plasticisers in concrete using the same design as earlier described and having a water cement W C ratio 0.60. Admixture dosage used was 140 am3 50 kg cement as 40 active solutions of their sodium salts. Results are summarised in Table I.

All the admixtures show some retardation on 1 day compressive strength. Admixture A gave slightly more retardation than D with C, showing significantly more retardation than A at 1 day. All 7 day compressive strength results were similar. A similar set of experiments were carried out at two different W C ratios, ie 0.64 and 0.56. Results are shown in Tables II and III respectively.

Further work was done to determine the effect of changes in the molecular weight and molar ratio of the components of the copolymer.

These results suggest that all the copolymers show some retardation of 1 day compressive strength, being most significant with the 67 mole AA 2 1 polymers. 7 and 28 day compressive strengths are very similar to control concrete except perhaps with the 67 mole AA polymers which are somewhat lower. Plasticising action is shown to be related to the molecular weight viscosity of the polymers and tends to increase as molecular weight viscosity decreases.
