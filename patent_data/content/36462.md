# A honeycomb structure for use as a catalyst support for automobile exhaust.

## Abstract
Low expansion ceramic materials consist essentially of from 1.5 to 20 by weight of magnesia, 8 to 68 by weight of alumina, 24 to 80 by weight of titanium calculated as titanium dioxide , and from 0.5 to 20 by weight of iron calculated as ferric oxide the major component of the crystalline phase of the materials being a magnesium oxide aluminium oxide titanium dioxide iron oxide solid solution, and the material having a coefficient of thermal expansion of not more than 20 x 10 ‚Å∑ 1 C , in the temperature range 25 to 800 C, and a melting point of not less than 1,500 C, the coefficient of thermal expansion being main tained even after exposure to a temperature of 1,100 C for 1,000 hours. A method of producing such ceramic materials comprises preparing a mixture plasticizing the mixture if necessary and shaping the plasticized batch drying the thus formed body and firing the formed body at 1,300 to 1,700 C for 0.5 to 48 hours. The ceramic material suitably has a honeycomb struc ture.
