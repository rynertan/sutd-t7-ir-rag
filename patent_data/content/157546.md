# Laser marking apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus for inscribing characters or other symbols onto moving articles or substrate. The symbols or characters are de fined by a matrix having a predetermined number of rows and colums. The apparatus includes a plurality of individual lasers, each dedicated to write a predetermined character row. Col umns are written in sequence as the article passes the laser head. Light energy from the lasers is directed by mirrors to an exit lens which focuses the laser beams onto the articles or substrate to be marked. Separate laser mirrors provide reduc tion in laser beam spacing thereby facilitating a corresponding ly foreshortened laser beam path. The lasers are arranged into two groups and interleaved to form the desired character row spacing without mirror overlap or shadowing.
