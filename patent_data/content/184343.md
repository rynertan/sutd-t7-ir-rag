# APPARATUS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF MINERAL FIBERS HAVING SUPPLEMENTAL COLLECTION CHAMBER EXHAUST

## Abstract
An apparatus 10 for the production and collection of mineral fibers 12 , comprising an air fiberization apparatus 11 for generating mineral fibers 12 , a collection chamber 13 for collecting the fibers produced, and a cyclone type air exhaust apparatus 37 connected by a duct 38 to an upper portion of the collection chamber, the exhaust apparatus reducing the air pressure generated within the collection chamber thereby increasing the efficiency of fiber collection, and means 41 for returning mineral fibers escaping from the collection chamber through the cyclone exhaust appar atus to the main fiber discharge position.
