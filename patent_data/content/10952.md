# Method and apparatus for heating semiconductor wafers.

## Abstract
To provide even heating of semiconductor wafers 24 in an elongated reaction tube 10 , a furnace 28 preferably surrounding only a part of the length of the reaction tube is caused to move along the tube so as to pass over each of the wafers placed in the tube. Gas inlet means 16, 19, 20 supply through the reaction tube a gas suitable for producing the required diffusion or coating, the gas escaping through outlet means 21, 22 .
