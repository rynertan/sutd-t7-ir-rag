# A process for preparing a branched novolac.

## Abstract
Large scale preparation of branched novolacs by the acid catalyzed, exothermic condensation of methylol reactive phenols with polymethylol diphenols is made practical by first carrying out the reaction on a scale which permits temperature control simply by cooling and then separately adding more of the premixed reactants and the catalyst at rates such that the temperature of the reaction mixture can readily be controlled.
