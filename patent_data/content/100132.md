# DEWATERING AND COMPACTING SCREEN

## Abstract
Material 19 to be dewatered is supplied to lower end 20 of foraminous structure 10 disposed between side fences 12, 14 and adapted to be vibrated by a vibrator unit 24 mounted be tween the fences 12, 14 by cheeks 20 which permit variation of the inclination of plate 26, on which the unit 24 is mounted, rel ative to the structure 10. The structure 10 is shaped to provide a plurality of side by side V shaped or U shaped troughs 40 along which the material 19 is progressed by the vibrations. As shown, these troughs are formed by truncated wedge sec tioned wires or strips 50 with lozenge or diamond sectioned wires or strips 52 at thenadirs but these troughs may be of rig id intersecting wire mesh, or of pliable mesh draped to define U sectioned troughs.
