## Description
The present invention is concerned with a vehicle sliding roof, of which the closure member is a strip made from flexible material. The difficulty with this kind of closure arises at the time when the flexible strip is positioned to effect sealing of the window, because such seal is either faulty with consequent discomfort for persons riding inside the vehicle, or alternatively it requires complex mechanisms that are difficult to construct. In order to overcome these difficulties, the closure arrangement for a vehicle sliding rood of the invention is characterised by a rectangular frame 4 over which extends a strip 1 of flexible material, this material being supported by transverse rods 2 and attached at its rear edge to a plate 8 that is secured to the frame 4 , while its front edge is attached to a movable plate 16 linked to opening and closing mechanisms which are provided with means whereby said movable plate 16 can be released from and secured to steel bodyworK of the vehicle. The construction preferably has sections from which the frame is constructed whose outside shape is such as to enable them to be securely affixed to the vehicle bodywork, while the insides of the lengthwise or side members are shaped with guides, and the front member is conveniently suitably slotted so as to accommodate claws which, when engaged, prevent the strip of flexible material from folding. The front edge of the strip of flexible material may be secured to a slightly curved plate, this in turn being attached to slotted angle bars lfaich are pivotally assembled together inside a case that accommodates the closing mechanism, and are attached to eccentric parts provided with securing claws. IMen said eccentric parts rotate, the plate is made to tip, and the securing claws to move in such a way that both latter and former travel to a position llerein the covering strip is folded into a different position wherein the claws engage with the front edge of the frame and prevent such folding, while simultaneously the plate is pressed against the steel roof of thevehicle, thus achieving a perfect seal.The mechanism case, which contains the eccentric mechanisms, may be provided with sliding blocks at its sides, which travel inside the guides along the frame so as to enable said case to be moved. The guides along the sides of the frame preferably also accommodate further sliding blocks which are attached to transverse rods connected to another and to the mechanism case by means of links, in such a way that they act as ribs. The strip of flexible material is conveniently secured to each one of these rods, and its rear edge is attached to a slightly curved plate affixed to the rearmost end of the frame. The arrangement of the ribs together with the front plate and its ability to slide, is such that it is feasible to fold the strip of flexible material, or to unfold it and close the opening. In order for the side edges of the flexible strip to fit snugly against the vehicle roof when closed, cords may be fitted lengthwise through said strip, and attached to the movable plate and to the rearmost stationary plate. Moreover, the front of the frame for the window may be fitted with a hinged flap, which is able to adopt any one of numerous positions and by adjustment alters the flour of air into the vehicle, thus performing the function of a wind deflector. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a general arrangement plan view of the construction according to this invention, Figure 2 is a sectional view across the plane indicated in Figure 1, where the device can be seen in the half open position, Figure 3 is an enlarged transverse sectional view of the mechanism case, in which the position of the front plate and its support are diagrammatically shown, Figure 4 is a view of the mechanism case from above, Figure 5 is a cross sectional view on the plane indicated in Figure 4, in which the handle withdrawing mechanism can be seen, and Figure 6 illustrates the bottom of the mechanism case, and shows specifically,the area in which the closing motion handle is located. A sliding roof device for a vehicle to be fitted to a vehicle roof as shown comprises a frame 4 that is rectangular in shape and constructed from metal sections whose shape is such that the outside of the frame assembly may be mated with and attached to the steel bodywork comprising the motor vehicle roof, while the inside shape of the side or longitudinal members form guideways. The front member of said frame possesses housings for accorwodating and allowing engagement therein of claws 25 , together with other housings therein studs 17 may enter to assist in centralising a mechanism case 13 . Moreover, said frame 4 is provided with strengtheners at its rear 3 and its front 7 , which are secured to the vehicle bodywork. The closure member of the sliding roof is in the form of a strip of flexible material 1 whose rearmost edge is attached to a curved stationary plate 8 which in turn is secured to the frame 4 , and whose foremost edge is attached to a further curved movable plate 16 , being capable of movement and secured to slotted angle bars 10 , which are pivotally assembled together inside the mechanism case 13 . Along its length between both these plate 8 and 16 flexible material strip is provided with transverse rods 2 attached thereto, of which one possesses two sliding blocks 9 and is joined to its neighbouring rod 2 by means of links 5 The transverse rod 2 which is located closest to the front movable plate 16 is also joined thereto by means of links 5 . Cords 6 are positione d along the side edges of the flexible material strip 1 , and they are attached to the rear stationary plate 8 and to the front movable plate 16 so that when the latter travels away from the former, said cords 6 become tautened and the side edges of the flexible material strip fit snugly upon the motor vehicle roof, Mechanism case 13 is located beneath the front movable plate 16 , and the outside thereof is provided with an operating handle 22, by means of which the mechanisms inside said case 13 can be moved.This operating handle 22 is linked by means of a connecting strip 21 to a thruster member 19 , which is guided by a body 20 , and it is connected by means of link pieces 18 and 26 to two eccentric parts 11 which swivel about their respective axes 23 , where each one of said parts 11 possesses a pivoted claw 25 protruding from the front of the mechanism 13 . Eccentric parts 11 furthermore possess protrusions which enter inside oblique slots 12 in angle bars 10 . The operating handle 22 , which is located on the outside of the mechanism case 13 , is concealed inside a housing provided for the purpose on said mechanism case 13 . The operating handle 22 is connected to a withdrawing mechanism comprised of a withdrawal lever 27 and a spring 28 . In order to enable the mechanism case 13 to travel along the length of the roof opening, it is provided with two sliding blocks 24 . Moreover, the front of said case 13 is fitted with the studs 17 to assist in centering the case upon entering the holes provided for this purpose on the front edge of frame 4 . Furthermore, a wind deflector 15 is attached by hinges 14 to the front of frame 4 , and is capable of turning and being positioned at will at different angles so as to perform its function of deflecting the wind0 When the motor vehicle roof sliding is in the position where the flexible material strip 1 covers the opening completely, the claws 25 are engaged within their housings on the inside of the frame 4 front member, to prevent said flexible material strip 1 from folding.This position is that shoxfn in Figure lo In order to open the window, the first step is to press upon the withdrawal lever 27 , which is located on the bottom of the mechanism case 13 , so that the operating lever 22 is forced out of its housing by a sufficient amount to enable it to be grasped. See Figure 5 . Handle 22 is then moved downwards, whereupon it rotates about its swivel and causes connecting strip 21 to be pulled, which in turn pulls thruster 19 in its guide body 20 , which shifts link pieces is and 26 , so that eccentric parts 11 each turn in the opposite direction from one another. Rotation of eccentric parts 11 causes travel of the claws 25 in the direction required to release them from their housings,and said rotation also tips the front movable plate 16 to lift it off the vehicle roof, which it does due to the oblique setting of slots 12 in angle bars 10 , these being the slide surfaces for travel of the protrusions of eccentric parts 11 . See Figure 3 . Once the above motions have been accomplished, the mechanism case 13 , together with the flexible material strip 1 can be freely moved rearwards in order to open the sliding roof. During this opening motion, the rod 2 , which is linked to mechanism case 13 , travels over the neighbouring one which is attached to sliding blocks 9 , so that a fold is made in the flexible strip 1 . As such rearward motion proceeds, the strip 1 pulls the next rod 2 attached to the sliding blocks 9 , and when this moves, the neighbouring one moves too, through their connecting links 5 , until said neighbouring rod travels over the rear stationary plate 8 and thus causes yet another fold to take place in the flexible strip 1 , whereupon this rod as well as the aforementioned one, become positioned over the rear of the opening. To position the sliding roof, handle 22 is moved until it is inserted inside i ts housing in the mechanism case 13 , whereupon the front moving plate 16 will travel downwards so that with the pressure it exerts on the frame 4 , it will prevent any closing motion thereof, and secure 4t in the position in which it is set. To close the sliding roof, mechanism case 13 is moved until studs 17 are inserted in their appropriate holes provided on the front member of the frame 4 , it then only being necessary to move the handle 22 into its concealed position so that claws 25 engage in their housings, while front moving plate 16 is folded onto the roof for sealing, which is completed by tautening of cords 6 to achieve tightness along the sides. In order to adjust the flow of air that enters the vehicle when the roof window is open, said window is provided with the wind deflector plate 15 which is hinged to the front edge of the frame 4 . The hinges are such as to allow the wind deflector lr to be set at any position as desired, and in this way the adjustment thereof is very simple.
