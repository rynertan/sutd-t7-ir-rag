## Description
The present invention relates generally to plasma etching reactors and more particularly to an improved plasma reactor for batch wafer processing as employed in the fabrication of integrated circuits. Plasma or reactive ion etching RIE is widely used to etch a variety of thin film materials and has been shown to be compatible with commonly used photoresist systems. One of the advantages of RIE is that it is a highly directional etching technique which does not exhibit many of the shortcomings of prior processes such as ion milling and sputter etching. The recent trend has been toward larger reactors which can process larger batches of semiconductor wafers, and thereby provide more economical integrated circuit manufacture. One problem encountered in scaling up RIE tools is maintaining a uniform etch rate from wafer to wafer in a batch. This problem has been addressed, with varying degrees of success, by prior art etching devices such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,297,162 to Mundt et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 4,307,283 to Zajac. Another such device is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,340,361 to Hendricks et al. and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The Hendricks et al. plasma chamber includes a conductive apertured baffle plate affixed to the anode for adjusting the etchant species concentration across the target to provide a uniform concentration from wafer to wafer. This is accomplished by providing large apertures in the baffle plate of various sizes, shapes and locations. U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,409 to Shibayama et al. discloses a plasma reactor including an electrically isolated, apertured, intermediate electrode between the anode and the cathode of the plasma chamber. The distance between the intermediate electrode and the cathode, and the electrode bias voltage, are varied during the etching process in order to remove any previously damaged surface layer and any unwanted deposits from the wafers being etched. An RF plasma reactor for batch processing is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,384,938 to Desilets et al., which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. In this reactor the cathode to chamber sidewall spacing is less than the thickness of the system plasma sheath to improve etch rate uniformity while maximizing the number of wafers that can be processed in a single batch. Another problem in scaling up a plasma reactor to a larger batch size is that the plasma potential is increased. This is particularly true in the case of reactors wherein the cathode size is maximized in order to increase the batch size, without increasing the overall diameter of the reactor. The increase in plasma potential is a result of the decrease in the area ratio of the plasma chamber, which is defined as the total surface area of the chamber at ground potential exposed to the plasma divided by the surface area of the electrode at high potential. For example, in a reactor such as the one described in the Desilets et al. patent, where the cathode size is maximized, a plasma potential as high as 160 170 volts has been observed. The plasma potential, i.e., the potential difference between the plasma and the grounded reactor surfaces, is a measure of the amount of ionic bombardment to which these surfaces are subjected. If the plasma potential is greater than the sputtering threshold of the reactor wall material, then the wafers being processed will be subjected to contamination from the sputtered materials from the reactor surfaces. The increased plasma potential also has been observed to increase the chemical activity of the reactor surfaces, which causes the larger system to etch differently as compared to a scaled down reactor and necessitates changes in the process parameters. It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an improved batch type plasma reactor of the aforementioned kind. This object is achieved by the features of claim 1 embodiments of the invention are characterized in the dependent claims. The improved plasma reactor allows for uniformly etching a large number of semiconductor wafers at a reduced plasma potential. The invention proposes a plasma reactor having a reactive ion etching chamber acting as an anode and a plate arrangement acting as cathode, wherein an RF signal between said cathode and said anode acts to produce a plasma. The anode etching chamber is cylindrical in shape and has an internal sidewall surface physically symmetrical about the cathode and is divided into an auxiliary chamber portion and an active plasma etching chamber portion by an anode plate member extending to the said sidewall surface of the etching chamber. The auxiliary chamber portion is connected to a pumpout port and the active plasma etching chamber portion is connected to some gas distribution means. The anode plate member has a plurality of holes therethrough to permit gas to be pumped from the active plasma etching chamber portion to the auxiliary chamber portion with the diameter of each hole of said plurality of holes being less than a fraction of the thickness of reactive ion etching dark space so that active plasma generation will not be sustained therein. Such a reactor is known from US A 4384938. The reactor is characterized in that it includes at least one ground plate spaced apart from the upper surface of the active plasma chamber portion by a predetermined distance large enough to allow a plasma to be established between the surface of said active plasma chamber portion and the topmost grounded plate. The lowest grounded plate has a distance to said cathode large enough not to disturb the field in the proximity of the cathode. Other objects and many of the attendant advantages of the present invention will be better understood by reference to the following detailed description in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals designate the same or similar parts throughout the several views, and wherein Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in FIG. 1 a plasma reactor 10 in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Reference is also made to U.S. Patent No. 4,384,938 to Desilets et al., which discloses a typical batch type plasma reactor to which the present invention is applied. In one embodiment the present reactor includes a cylindrical, symmetrical plasma chamber which functions as the anode. Reactor 10 is formed of a conductive e.g., aluminum top plate 12, a bottom plate 14, and a sidewall 16, the lower portion of which includes rings 18. Rings 18 provide a means for adjusting the chamber size as well as accessing the chamber for cleaning, maintenance and the like. A reactor cathode 20 spaced apart from sidewall rings 18 is separated from the chamber bottom plate 14 by an insulator 22. As explained in the Desilets et al. patent, the gap 24 between cathode 20 and rings 18 is preferably less than about 3.0 mm., assuming a dark space or reactor plasma sheath on the order of 1.25 cm., to assure that a plasma will not be sustained therein. Cathode 20 includes a plurality of cooling channels 26, a cooling fluid inlet port 28 and a cooling fluid outlet port 30 to aid in regulating the cathode temperature and thus the temperature of wafers 32 placed thereon. RF power is applied to cathode 20 by means of a connection 34. Reactor 10 is divided into a lower active plasma chamber 36 and an upper gas manifold 38 by a conductive anode plate member 40 which acts to confine the plasma to chamber 36. Plate 40 forms the top plate of plasma chamber 36 and, in conjunction with sidewall rings 18 and bottom plate 14, acts as the reactor anode which is grounded. Spaced apart from plate 40, within plasma chamber 36, is a solid conductive plate 42. Plate 42 is coupled to plate 40 by conductive spacers 44. The gap between the periphery of plate 42 and chamber sidewall rings 18 must be greater than the thickness of the system plasma sheath, and the diameter of plate 42 should be greater than the diameter formed by the pattern of wafers 32 on cathode 20. The distance between plate 42 and plasma chamber top plate 40, designated L in FIG. 1, must be large enough to allow a plasma to be established therebetween, yet not so large as to disturb the electric field in the proximity of wafers 32. In practice, L should be a distance of several dark spaces , i.e., several times the thickness of the system plasma sheath. Also, plate 42 should be positioned at least several mean free paths of the reactive ion species used in the etchant gas above cathode 20. The etchant gas is supplied to plasma chamber 36 via a gas inlet tube 46 connected to a nozzle 48 affixed to the underside of plate 40. The gas and any reaction products are pumped out of chamber 36 through pump out holes in plate 40. Holes 50 should be less than about 1.5 mm. in diameter so as not to sustain an active plasma as explained above. The gas is removed from manifold 38 through port 52. In some processes it may be advantageous to provide apertures 54 one shown in plate 42 to provide uniform etchant gas distribution to each of the wafers 32 on cathode 20. As explained above with respect to holes 50, the diameter of each aperture 54 should be less than about 1.5 mm. The aperture pattern can be tailored to meet the requirements of a particular process. Various known etchant gas mixtures may be employed in the present plasma reactor to carry out conventional reactive ion etching. One common gas used for this purpose is CF₄ and O₂. Other typical gases are CHF₃, SF₆ and CClF₃. The addition of grounded plate 42 to plasma chamber 36 has been found to be an effective means of reducing the plasma potential by substantially increasing the area ratio of the chamber and producing a plasma density in the region of plate 42 that is equal to or greater than the plasma density near cathode 20. Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown another embodiment of the present invention wherein multiple grounded plates are employed to further reduce the plasma potential. A second grounded plate 56 is spaced apart a distance L2 from plate 42 by conductive spacers 58. Distance L2 may be less than, equal to or greater than L1, however, L2 should be at least equal to the thickness of the system plasma sheath. Plate 56 should be positioned several plasma sheath thicknesses above the plasma sheath in the proximity of cathode 20. The diameter of plate 56 can be less than or equal to the diameter or plate 42, but plate 56 should be larger than the pattern of wafers 32 on cathode 20. Additional grounded plates may be used subject to the above described criteria. By way of example, the plasma potential was measured in a plasma reactor as shown in FIG. 1, but without plate 42. Chamber 36 was approximately 59 cm 23.25 in. in diameter and about 13,7 cm 5.4 in. high. Using CF₄ gas at a pressure of 1,33.10 ⁶bar 54 microns and a flow rate of 40 SCCM Standard cm³ , and an RF power of 775 watts, the measured plasma potential was 200 volts. With a solid aluminum plate 42 having a diameter of about 58,4 cm 23 in. and a spacing L of about 1,27 cm 0.5 in. installed in chamber 36, the measured plasma potential under similar process conditions was 58 volts. The etch uniformity from wafer to wafer was about 10 with plate 42 as compared to about 7 without the plate. The addition of a second solid plate 56 with a diameter of about 53,3 cm 21.0 in. and a spacing L2 of 1,27 cm 0.5 in. , with plate 42 being apertured, resulted in a plasma potential of about 59 volts and an improved etch uniformity of about 7 . The use of two or more solid plates would yield a lower plasma potential with less etch uniformity. There has thus been provided by the present invention an improved plasma reactor for RIE processing a large batch of wafers at a reduced plasma potential as compared to prior reactors, resulting in a substantial reduction in wafer contamination due to the sputtering of chamber wall material.
