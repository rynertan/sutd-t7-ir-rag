# A gate turn off Thyristor and a method of producing the same.

## Abstract
A method of producing a gate turn off thyristor compris ing a first n type impurity region 24 , a second p type impurity region 22 , a third n type impurity region 21 , and a fourth p type impurity region 23 produced in a semiconduc tor substrate in the above mentioned order from the side of the first main surface of the semiconductor substrate, a cathode electrode 7 provided in contact with the first n type impurity region 24 , a gate electrode 6 provided in contact with the second p type impurity region 22 , and an anode electrode 5 which short circuits the third region 21 and the fourth region 23 at the second main surface of the semiconductor substrate, which method is characterised in that gold is diffused in the third region 21 at a predeter mined diffusion temperature, thereby to shorten the life time of the third region.
