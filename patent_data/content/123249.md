# Semiconductor memory device having a floating gate.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device includes first and sec ond n type regions 12 and 13 formed in the surface area of a p type substrate 11 a floating gate FG2 insulatively formed over a channel region 11A between the first and second n type regions 12 and 13 and a control gate CG2 disposed to face the floating gate FG2 . The area of portion of the control gate CG2 which faces the floating gate FG2 is set to be smaller than the effective area of portion of this floating gate FG2 which faces the active region including the first and second n type regions 12 and 13 and channel region 11A .
