## Description
PART FEEDING DEVICE The present invention relates to a part feeding device used for, for example, an assembling robot system. In an assembling robot system, a part feeding device has been used for holding a large number of relatively small and thin parts, such as wave washers, which are laminated in an up and down motion. In this part feeding device, the uppermost parts are separated one by one from the other parts and are fed to the robot. Such separation of the parts one by one is performed by an air suction means which is, for example, provided in a hand of the robot. In the above mentioned part feeding device, however, two or more parts are picked up simultaneously due to the presence of oil, dust, or the like between the parts. It is, therefore, a principal object of the present invention to provide a part feeding device in which two or more parts are prevented from being picked up simultaneously. According to the present invention, there is provided a part feeding device for separating a plurality of laminated magnetic parts one by one and feeding the uppermost magnetic part thereof, comprising means for generating a magnetic field to the magnetic parts so as to generate a repulsive force between the magnetic parts and a pickup means for picking up the uppermost magnetic part magnetized by the magnetic field generating means. The present invention will be more clearly understood from the description as set forth below with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is a longitudinal cross sectional view illustrating a first embodiment of the part feeding device according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along the line II II of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 is a partial view illustrating the operation of the device of Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a longitudinal cross sectional view illustrating a second embodiment of the part feeding device according to the present invention. In Fig. 1, a large number of magnetic parts, such as wave washers 1, are laminated in an up and down motion on a base 2. This base 2 moves up and down along two guiderails 3 1 and 3 2 on the inner surface of a nonmagnetic acryl resin cylinder 4 and a screw 5 located at the center of the cylinder 4. The up and down motion is performed by a ratchet wheel 6 fixed to the screw 5.This ratchet wheel 6 is rotated by an air cylinder 7 at a pitch of, for example, 90 degrees. According to the present invention, an electromagnet 8 is provided for generating a magnetic field so as to create a repulsive force between the parts 1 and, accordingly, to separate the parts 1 from each other. Particularly, in this case, in view of gravitation, there is generated an air gap between the uppermost magnetic part and the magnetic part immediately beneath it. A pickup 9 for picking up the uppermost part is provided with a hand of a robot not shown . In this case, the pickup 9 is comprised of an air suction means. As will be understood from Fig. 2, even if the base 2 is moved up and down by rotating the screw 5, the base 2 itself does not rotate and, accordingly, the magnetic parts 1 do not rotate. Returning to Fig. 1, the operation of the device ofFig. 1 will now be explained with reference to Fig. 3.When a current 11 is supplied to a coil 8a of the electromagnet 8, the electromagnet 8 generates a magnetic field to the magnetic parts 1. As a result, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the magnetic poles of the uppermost magnetic part la and the magnetic part lb immediately beneath the part la are both S poles near the N pole of the electromagnet 8 and are both N poles near the S pole of the electromagnet 8. Therefore, a repulsive force is generated between the parts la and lb so as to create an air gap 10. Next, the pickup 9 descends to suck up only the uppermost magnetic part la Fig. 3 . In this case, air flows as indicated by the arrows X Fig. 1 . Then the pickup 9 holding the part la is moved to a working table not shown of the robot system and, accordingly, the part la is mounted on the working table. In this case, it is assumed that each part 1 Fig. 1 is 0.25 mm in thickness and the screw 5 generates a 1 mm lead per one rotation. Then when the air cylinder 7 is operated by one stroke, the screw 5 rotates 90 degrees and, accordingly, the base 2 feeds up at a distance equal to the thickness of one magnetic part 1. After that, the pickup 9 sucks up the second part 1b. In Fig. 4, a pickup 9 comprised of a magnetic field generating means electromagnet is provided instead of the pickup 9 of Fig. 1 comprised of an air suction means. However, tba eratS of the pickup 9 is similar to that of the pickup 9. In Fig. 4, when the pickup 9 descends and a current I2 is supplied to a coil 9a of the pickup 9 , the magnetic force induced by the pickup 9 is small as compared with the magnetic force repulsive magnetic force between the parts induced by the electromagnet 8. Therefore, even in this case, the pickup 9 picks up only the uppermost part. As explained hereinbefore, the part feeding device according to the present invention is advantageous in that the feeding of two or more magnetic parts simultaneously does not occur since the laminated magnetic parts are definitely separated one by one by the magnetic field generating means the electromagnet 8 .
