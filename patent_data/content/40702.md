# Authorization mechanism for transfer of program control or data between different address spaces having different storage protect keys.

## Abstract
An enhancement in a system 370 data processor permits one program in one address space to abtain access to data in another address space or to call a program in another address space without invoking a supervisor, with authorization to use a storage protect key other than that specifically assigned to the program by a supervisor program when in a new semi privileged state. Programs executing in a particular address space have supervisor assigned storage protect key masks permitting the program, when authorized, to utilize a storage protect key other than the one specifically assigned by the supervisor. A second address space can be designated by a program, and when authorized, can cause transfer of data in main memory from one physical location to another associated with the different address space, and two different storage protect keys can be utilized. A calling program can provide addressability to data in its address space by combining storage protect key masks from the calling program with a key mask of a called program to permit access to data by the called program. Entering the called program causes the saving and changing of a problem supervisor control bit and instruction address.
