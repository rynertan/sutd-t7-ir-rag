# Polyolefin coating containing an ionomer for metal substrates.

## Abstract
A method for coating a metal surface by depositing a mixture comprising a polyolefin and an ionomer on the metal surface, which is at a temperature sufficient to fuse the mixture to the metal surface, and thereafter cooling the resulting coated surface and the coated article produced by the method. The method is especially useful in coating a ferrous metal surface, such as, for example, the interior surface of a pipe.
