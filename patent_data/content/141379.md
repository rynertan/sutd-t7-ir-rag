# Method and apparatus for forming upper stops of a concealed type slide fastener.

## Abstract
The invention provides method and apparatus for forming upper stops of a concealed type slide fastener. A concealed type slide fastener comprises a pair of fastener stringers each consisting of a fastener tape having a turn up along one side thereof and fastener elements of thermoplas tic resin secured to the turn up. Portions of the elements are fused to form upper stops. In the method and apparatus of the invention, a pair of spaced projections are formed on a base and placed with respect to fastener stringers of a slide fastener or continuous fastener chain so that the projections pass between the stringers. The fastener elements are urged towards the projections while portions of the projections engage and arrest the element mounting side margins of the tapes to expose the interengaging heads of the elements so that only the interengaging heads are fused.
