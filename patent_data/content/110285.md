# INTERCONNECTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

## Abstract
The invention describes a method of producing an elec trical circuit incorporating integrated circuits on semicon ductor chips, which comprises mounting the electrical com ponents 10 which are to constitute the circuit including the unpackaged semiconductor chips on an insulating substrate 12 in such a manner that the contact areas of the com ponents lie in a substantially flat plane, and depositing a conductive pattern over the substrate to establish electrical connection between the components of the circuit.
