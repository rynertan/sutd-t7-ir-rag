## Description
The invention refers to a reader inscriber of magnetic characters readable by computer, which may be used to encode documents. Various machines of this type are known commercially, being in general very big and complicated, the manufacturing costs of which are very high and which, in most cases, are able only to read or only to write. The machine now proposed, due to its capacity of performing both functions, has the advantages of a carefully studied organization which allows to reduce its manufacturing costs and, especially, of a small size which makes it able to be used in windows or counters providing services to the public, so that treated documents may be encoded and computer processed from the initial operation to simplify the administrative paperwork and to eliminate mistakes. The small size of the device results from the application of various solutions for feeding and guiding the documents in combination with the procedure used to print the magnetic characters. The machine is entirely built around a single frame plate on the top face of which there is a guiding element which pulls the documents through a combination of driving rollers, so that the papers go through the printing and reading heads. Specially worth noting are a first roller which ensures the correct positioning of the document on the guiding element so that it reaches the heads in the appropriate position, as well as the device which starts the movement of the document as soon as the machine is required to operate. Other features of the equipment are the way in which the printing head works and the existence of a device which detects the end of the magnetic ribbon used by the machine. These and other special features of the machine will become evident from the following detailed description which will be done with reference to the annexed drawings. These drawings only show the essential mechanical parts of the invention, at the exclusion, for concision, of parts such as the electric circuit plates and the motor frame. Fig. 1 is a top view of the frame plate, showing the document guiding element, the inscribing mechanism and the reading heads, as well as the layout of the end of the ribbon detector and other features. Fig. 2 is a view from the bottom of the same frame plate in order to illustrate the way in which transmission is received by the driving rollers which pull the documents. Fig. 3 is a side elevation view of the frame plate, from which it may especially be noted the inclined position of the first driving roller which, within the guiding element, positions the document to be processed. Fig. 4 is a second side elevation view showing the pressure rollers which aid the driving rollers to pull the documents through the guide, as well as the printing head and the device which sets off the paper movement., when the machine is set in operation. Fig. 5 is a longitudinal cross section of the frame plate along the plane A B pointed out in Fig. 1, where the document.guide has been removed to clearly show how the documents are pulled by the driving rollers. Fig. 6 is a scheme of the layout of the driving rollers illustrated in the previous figure, together with the pressure rollers with which they drive the documents. Fig. 7 is a side elevation view of the device,that sets off the paper movement. Fig. 8 is a top view of the same device. Fig. 9 represents an elevation view, partially in cross section, of the combination of the printing head and of its motor, showing its rotation control means. After this general description of the drawings, and starting with a general explanation of the machine which covers it in its entirety, and giving then the details of the various proposed solutions, reference will be at first made to Figures 1 to 4. As it may be seen, this machine is substantially comprised of a single frame plate I along the entire length of which, and on the top, there is a guide 2 for the documents to be processed, which broadens at one of its ends to form an opening 3 which facilitates the introduction of the documents therein. The guide 2 has side openings 4 immediately above the frame plate I which allow the penetration of a series of driving rollers 5 and 6 which push the document against the pressure rollers 7 and 8 in order to drive it. A paper positioning roller 9 and a device that sets it in motion 10 , which will be described later on, are located at the beginning of the guide. The machine has a first motor 11 which moves the driving rollers, a second motor 12 which rotates the printing head 15 made up by a character, or daisy wheel and a third motor 13 which simultaneously operates, in the same sense and at different speeds, the pulling axles 42 of the ribbon used by the machine. Finally, there is a device which detects the end of the writing ribbon, which may be seen on Figures I and 4, under reference numeral 14 . The movement of motor 11 is transmitted to the driving rollers 5 and 6 through a toothed belt 16 which gears with the outlet pinion of the driving axle 17 , as well as with other pinions located on axles 19 of the rollers 15 , and on the axles 20 of the rollers 6 . In addition, on axle 19 of the first roller 5 there is a pulley 21 which, through a belt 22 , operates another pulley 24 set on an axle 25 which is inclined with respect to the frame 1 , forming a sharp angle in the sense in which the paper is pulled at top end, this axle 25 bears the positioning roller 9 , already mentioned. A set of sheaves 23 whose axle is parallel to the chassis 1 , aid the belt 22 to make the change of plane existing between pulley 21 and pulley 24 . Driving rollers 5 and 6 as best seen in Figures 1, 4 and 6 receive the pressure of rollers 7 and 8 , mounted on elastic laminar armatures 26 see specially Figure 4 tending to maintain these latter rollers in permanent contact with the above mentioned driving rollers. In addition, and as best seen in Figures 5 and 6, the driving rollers 6 placed at the end of the guide 2 are clamped by toric belts 27 and have between them three other small guiding rollers 28 , also clamped by the belts 27 with which they make up a mobile, perpendicular back up surface which forces the document 29 to be in close contact with the magnetic reading heads 30 placed between the rollers 8 , as it goes through, pulled by the driving rollers. Finally, and with respect to the pulling of documents, the mechanism is furnished with a device that sets it in motion, which works together with the positioning roller 9 , already described, which is shown in detail in Figures 7 and 8, where the place it holds within the mechanism in Figures 1 and 4 may be seen. This device is made up of a first degree lever, articulated around an axis 31 placed perpendicularly on the frame 1 and which has an axis 33 on its resistance end 32 , parallel to the positioning roller 9 and which also bears a wheel 34 . This resistance end 32 is checked by a torsion spring 38 mounted on the lever axis 31 so that the wheel 34 moves away from the roller 9 , and bears against a fixed stop 37 mounted on the frame 1 . On the other hand, the power end 35 of the lever can receive a thrust opposite to the torsion spring tension, through a rod 39 which passes through the frame 1 through a link slot 40 and which is joined to the core of an electromagnet 36 . Through the organization described above, the operation of the pulling mechanism Is done as follows After introducing the document to be processed through the opening 3 of the guide 2 , when the command to operate is received by the machine, the motor starts running I I setting in motion the driving rollers 5 and 6 by means of the toothed belt 16 , and the positioning roller 9 by means of the toroidal belt 22 . Immediately, the electromagnet 36 of the device which sets the mechanism in motion receives an impulse which causes lever bearing the wheel 34 to rotate and consequently the approaching of the latter to the positioning roller 9 , on which It momentarily presses the document to be processed. As a consequence of this operation, the document is quickly pulled forward, and its lower edge tends to lie on the bottom of the guide 2 being led by the inclined position of the roller 9 which, In this manner, ensures the correct position of the paper from the start. The joint action of the wheel 34 and of the roller 9 continues, until the forward edge is held between the first set of driving rollers 5 and the pressure rollers 7 , which lead it in front of the daisy wheel 15 and a striking mechanism 47 which is not a part of the invention . Afterwards, the document reaches the second set of driving rollers 6 and, being caught between them and the pressure rollers 8 it advances through the support track defined by the toric belts 27 and the guiding rollers 28 , where it is exposed, before ending its course, to the action of the reading heads 30 , as better illustrated in Figures 5 and 6. The daisy wheel 15 or printing head, which Is set in motion directly by the motor 12 , and which, because of Its operational position must very rapidly rotate to the right and to the left, has an inertia absorbing element which allows it to stop In a very brief time before starting a new rotation. This mechanism Is shown in detail in Figure 9, and will be explained below. As it may be seen, this mechanism is made up of a part with a T shaped section 44 , anchored to the end of the axis 43 of the motor 12 , which is opposite the daisy wheel bearing end this part has a spring 45 coiled around its core, through which an inerta mass 46 that may freely and concentrically rotate on the axis 43 is brought axially, being aided by a felt washer 47 , against a wheel 48 , also anchored on the axis 43 and which also bears a peripheral wing with signals which, combined to the photodetector 49 , locate the characters to be printed. With this structure, when the axis 43 starts rotating in any of both senses, in addition to rotating parts 44 and 48 which are integral with it, the tension of the spring 45 immobilizes the inertia mass 46 with respect to such parts, and the mass also rotates. The movement inertia is then stored by the mass 46 , which overpowers the tension of the spring 45 and continues to rotate after the axis has stopped, allowing the daisy wheel to stop exactly at the time and position required. The last novel characteristic of the proposed equipment consists in a device which detects the end of the ribbon, which is clearly shown in Figures 1 and 4. The single use, magnetic ribbon is contained in closed cartridges like that depicted by the dotted line in Figure 1, these cartridges being located on the frame 1 so that a portion of its periphery fits into the center cavity 50 of a generally U shaped part having a reflecting surface 53 on the arm located under the cartridge, and a photodetector on the inner face of the other arm 52 . Besides, in the portion fitting inside the cavity 50 of the part 14 ,the cartdrige has a little window through which the writing ribbon faces the photodetector the ribbon end is also made of reflecting material. By means of this structure, whereas the cartridge is set up on the frame, and the ribbon is being used, the photodetector remains neutralized. However, when the ribbon finishes, Its reflecting end faces the photodetector, which is activated and lights a pilot lamp 54 preferably located next to another pilot lamp 55 which indicates whether the machine is on or off. Of course, the same effect is obtained by removing the cartridge containing the magnetic writing ribbon, since the reflecting surface 53 located on the arm 51 of the U shaped part directly faces the photodetector and actuates it. The invention is in no way limited to the details such as described and shown because many variants and changes may be brought thereto without departing from the scope of the present patent.
