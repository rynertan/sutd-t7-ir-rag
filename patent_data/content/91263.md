# Improved singulating seeder for high density plug trays.

## Abstract
A seeder is disclosed which includes prior art elements of a bottom stationary drop plate, an intermediate and sliding reciprocating cell plate with individual singulating cells, and wiper bars overlying and in sliding engagement with the cell plate. The improvement herein has the over lying wiper bars B apertured in registry to the underlying drop holes. The cell plate S at each inaividual singulating cell reciprocates to and from a position of registry with and to the wiper bar B apertures above and drop apertures D below. Reciprocation to a position of registry typically accumulates a singulated seed in each cell of the cell plate S , and thus places the seeder in position for seeding with singulation. A probe R , registered to the wiper bar B aperture is mounted for reciprocation relative to the wiper bar aperture. The probe R is actuated in its reciprocation when registration of the singulating cell to the wiper bar aperture and drop hole is effected. Upon occurrance of this registration, the probe passes downwardly, penetrates through and clears both the singulating cell S and drop hole D . Probe penetration typically continues passing beyond the bottom of the drop hole to urge seed into the receiving aperture only of the underlying plug T . Apparatus for accomplishing this function remotely is disclosed.
