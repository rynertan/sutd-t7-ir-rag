## Description
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for alerting a patient to take medication. It is a frequent occurrence that a patient does not properly take medication as prescribed by his or her physician. This is especially true for elderly patients who must take several different medications at various times throughout the day. The problem has been especially serious when the patient has impaired eyesight and or is confused. The problem manifests itself in various ways, such as 1 failure to take the medication, 2 taking the wrong medication 3 taking too much of, or too little of, the correct medication, and 4 taking the medication at an incorrect time. Despite the fact that the aforesaid problem has existed for generations it has not been satisfactorily solved. The closest approach has been a portable pill container that emits a signal when medication is to be taken. Such a device, while helpful, does not provide a fully adequate solution. In particular, it commonly cannot indicate to the patient which one of several prescribed medications is to be taken when the signal is given, much less does it signal how much medication is to be taken. It generally also fails to take action in the event the patient does not heed the signal. In US A 4382688, the problem aspect that is tackled is the one of reminding someone who has to take a pill, such as a contraceptive pill, daily not to miss any days. There is also a memory facility whereby certain days are missed if that is a requirement attaching to the particular pill being taken but the disclosure does not go beyond the circumstance in which one pill is taken at a time. US A 4275384 directs itself to a rather different problem aspect, that is to say the case in which someone needs to take a number of different kinds of medication during the day. The apparatus disclosed is directed toward ensuring that none of the several different kinds of medication is missed. To that end, there is provided a small portable cabinet in which are placed a number of cartons or bottles containing the different kinds of medication and the cabinet has apparatus to indicate to the user at appropriate times which of the containers of different medications he should take a dose of medication from at that time. Neither of the foregoing disclosures tackles the problem of how much medication is to be taken, in the circumstance where one is not merely dealing with a single pill dose. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of alerting a patient to take medication comprising The invention further provides apparatus for alerting a patient to take medication comprising More specifically, and in a preferred embodiment, a container with a plurality of medication compartments may be used to store a plurality of medications. An electrical signalling circuit, having a timing system therein, not only gives a signal whenever medication is to be taken but indicates the compartment from which the medication is to be taken. This indication is given by illuminating a light bank positioned closely adjacent the desired compartment. The number of lights, of the light bank, which are illuminated, indicates the quantity of medication to be taken from the designated compartment i.e. if the medication is in the form of pills the illumination of three lights, for example, of the bank, indicates that three pills are to be taken from the designated compartment. If the patient obeys the commands of the system and opens the designated compartment, removes the desired medication and then closes the compartment, the aforesaid signals will be turned off until the next time arrives for taking medication. If the patient fails to obey the commands of the system and does not open and close the designated compartment within a predetermined interval of time, an alarm will be given. The alarm and the signal will be shut off when the designated compartment is opened and closed. Generally, any single medication is to be taken periodically throughout the day. Therefore, the electrical circuitry associated with each compartment may be preset to any one of several periods, for example four, six, eight, twelve or twenty four hours. The period for each compartment may be set independently of the settings for the other compartments, and the period for a given compartment may be selected so that it is appropriate to the medication in the compartment to which the setting is applicable. When the medication in any given compartment is not to be taken at night, the patient may depress a special night cut off switch which latches out the signaling system for the night however, the signaling system automatically restarts at a preset time the next morning. The device has a number of manually operable switches that are pre set to obtain proper operating conditions. To avoid accidental manual operation of these switches they are mounted in a cavity between upstanding ribs, and can be depressed only with a pointed instrument. As stated above, the take medication signal, and the alarm if operating , are turned off when the patient opens and closes the compartment. This operation is carried out by having a separate closure for example a lid for opening and closing each compartment. When the lid is moved to close the compartment a switch, operating through the electrical circuit of the signaling system, turns off the take medication signal including said light bank and the alarm if it is operating . Each compartment has its own signaling circuits, although same parts such as a timing circuit, an audible signal, the alarm signal, and the reload signaling system, are common to all compartments. The timing circuit feeds predetermined periodic timing signals to the signaling circuits of all compartments. There are settable switches associated with each compartment which enable the desired period four hours, six hours, etc. to be selected. Each signal of each group of periodic signals sets a bistable device which activates the take medication bank of lights adjacent to the compartment containing the medication to be taken in response to such signal. An audible signal is also given. If in response to the command of the take medication signal the patient opens and closes the lid of the applicable compartment, the bistable device is reset and the take medication signal is turned off. If the lid is not operated after a predetermined time, the bistable device remains set and a timing circuit turns on an alarm. The timing circuit has a twenty four hour signal which will restart the take medication signal each morning if it is turned off at night as aforesaid. The night switch, when operated, resets the bistable devices and prevents the setting thereof, but the twenty four hour signal will set A 7 divider receives the twenty four hour signal and gives the reload signal, once a week, which directs the patient to reload the compartments with medication. If desired, the audible signal may be a transducer which emits speech giving special instructions to the patient relating to the taking of the medication. Arrangements embodying the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates a pill container 12 having a screw type lid or cap 1 , and an electrical switch 11 which momentarily operates electrical circuitry hereinafter described when the cap 1 is screwed onto the container 12 to close it. Figure 2 illustrates casing 13 having four different pill compartments 14, 15, 16 and 17, having lids 18, 19, 2 and 21 respectively. Each of the four lids 18, 19, 2 and 21 for the four compartments 14, 15, 16 and 17, is pivoted at its inner end to the pill compartment for example lid 21 is attached to compartment 17 by a pivoted connection 26 which permits the lid 21 to be opened and closed by rotating it about the connection 26. Each of lids 18, 19, 2 and 21 has means for holding it closed for example, the lid 21 has a projection terminating in a large ball 28 which snaps into contoured indent 27. The ball 28, and or the walls defining indent 27, are sufficiently flexible so that the ball 28 snaps into and out of indent 27. The lids 18, 19, 2 and 21 have associated electrical switches 22, 23, 24, and 25 respectively. Each of these four switches is arranged to be momentarily closed or opened if the associated circuitry so requires when its complementary lid 18, 19, 2 or 21 is closed. Located within the casing 13, but not in any of the compartments 14 to 17, is the electrical circuitry shown in Figures 4 and 5. Basically, this circuitry can be set to give signals from time to time to alert the patient to take one or more pills. The circuitry will also designate the pill compartment 14 to 17 which contains the pill to be taken at any given time by illuminating one or more of the four light banks 29 31, 32 34, 35 37 and 38 4 . Assume, for purpose of illustration, that a patient is to take pills, everyday, as follows Pills, A, B, C, and D would be placed in compartments 14, 15, 16, and 17, respectively. The electrical circuitry, as we shall see, is settable to give signals at the various times, each day, at which pills are to be taken. For Pill A, the patient will select circuitry that will repeat its signals every four hours starting at 7 AM. For Pill B, the patient will select circuitry that will repeat itself every six hours, again starting at 7 AM. For Pill C, the patient will select circuitry that will repeat itself every 12 hours starting at 7 AM and for Pill D, the patient will select circuitry that repeats itself once each day at 7 AM. To satisfy the above illustration, at 7 AM the circuitry of Figures 4 and 5 will emit an audible signal for fifteen seconds and which audible signal will repeat itself once a minute until it is stopped by the operation of switch 22 upon the closing of the lid 18 of compartment 14. At the same time that the audible signal begins, the electrical circuitry of Figures 4 and 5 will energize one or more of the three signal lights 29, 3 and 31 in the light bank 29 31. The light bank 29 31 is located closely adjacent to compartment 14, and thereby indicates to the patient that he or she is to take medication from compartment 14. The light bank 29 31 is deenergized by switch 22 when the lid 18 of compartment 14 is closed. The light bank 29 31 has three signal lights 29, 3 and 31 Fig. 5 which are pre settable, as will appear, so that when the light bank 29 31 is energized only the correct number of these three lights will be energized. If one light is illuminated it means that the patient is to take only one pill from the compartment 14. When two of the signal lights are illuminated the patient is to take two pills from the compartment 14. When all three lights 29, 3 and 31, are illuminated, the patient is to take three pills. Light bank 32 34 is closely adjacent compartment 15, light bank 35 37 is closely adjacent compartment 16, and light bank 38 4 is closely adjacent compartment 17. Thus, each light bank serves one compartment, and its function in conjunction with its complementary compartment is the same as the function of light bank 29 31 in conjunction with compartment 14. Similarly, at 3 PM, and again at 7 PM a similar series of events occurs. Since the timing circuitry repeats itself every 24 hours, each of compartments 14 to 17 may contain a number of pills that is compartment 14 may contain a one week supply of pill A, compartment 15 may contain a one week supply of pill B, etc. Wires A and C of Figure 4 connect to wires A and C respectively, of Figure 5. The block diagrams shown in Figures 4 and 5 show the logic and electronic circuitry to perform the following functions and operations If the arrangement is designed to have an LCD 69a with an output inscribed with the word MEAL , the pill in the container 14, 15, 16 or 17 closest to that LCD 69a would be taken at the meal next following the illumination of LCD 69a. Either ICM7233 which provides 4 characters of 18 segments or ICM7234 which will drive 5 characters of 18 segments, would be suitable for driving the LCD. A signal from the divider 61 occurs seven days later causing the yellow LED 66 to be turned on indicating that it is time to re load the box with medication. Alternatively, an LCD display of LOAD could be used rather than the yellow LED 66. The LOAD signal recurs every seven days, and thereby instructs the patient to re load compartments 14 to 17 with pills. After each reloading the patient momentarily depresses switch 64 to turn off the load signal light 66. The following is a detailed description of the operation of the electrical circuit shown in Figures 4 and 5. The symbols used in the figures follow accepted usage in showing logic devices. Where non standard or special symbols are used, they are explained in the text. Figure 4 shows that part of the circuit that is common to all compartments and contains all parts of the circuit that perform functions not unique to any particular compartment 14 to 17. Figure 5 shows those parts of the circuit unique to each compartment 14, 15, 16 and 17 and that, therefore, must be duplicated for each compartment 14, 15, 16 and 17. All timing signals and the electrical signals for the audible signal originate in the clock 41. A commercially available unit suitable for this function is the Intersil ICM7213 One Second One Minute Precision Clock and Reference Generator. The signal present on pin 14 of this clock 41 is an electrical pulse occuring at a rate of one pulse per minute 1 6 Hz . These pulses are applied to a string of dividers 42 to 5 that act to divide the frequency at which the pulses occur. This is the equivalent to multiplying the time interval between pulses by the same factor. The divide by ten 1 divider 42 is typically a Motorola MC14 17B Decade Counter Divider. The 6 divider 43 and 3 divider 47 are typically Motorola MC14 18B Presettable Divide by N Counters. The 2 dividers 44, 45, 46, 48, 49 and 5 are typically Motorola MC14516B Binary Up Down Counters. The 1 divider 42, and 6 divider 43, taken together divide the output of clock 41 by 6 and therefore produce a pulse once per hour at the output of divider 43. Dividers 44, 45 and 46 generate pulses at intervals of 2, 4 and 8 hours respectively. In a similar fashion, dividers 47 to 5 generate pulses at intervals of 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. The eight lines terminating at the bottom of Figure 4 carry the signals for the eight periods described above. All eight lines go to all compartments, 14, 15, 16 and 17, of the casing 13. Refer now to Figures 1 and 5. The compartments 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the casing 13 have switches 22, 23, 24 and 25, respectively. Each compartment 14, 15, 16 and 17 has a set of parts identical to 7 to 87 incl., 29 31 incl., and 69. It should be understood that the description of the electrical circuitry for compartment 14 is valid for any of the compartments 15, 16 and 17 and that the four compartments 14 to 17 can be programmed independently of each other. All timing signals go to all compartments independently of what is happening with any of the others. Whether or not the alarm 68 is answered for one compartment has no bearing on whether the alarm 68 will sound for one of the other compartments. To select the desired timing one of switches 72 to 79 is closed. For the illustration given above for Pill A, switch 75, which selects a four hour period between the taking of pills, would be closed. At the chosen time the signal through switch 75 is connected to one of the inputs of the eight input NOR gate 8 . This is typically a Motorola MC14 78B 8 Input NOR Gate. All inputs and outputs of logic elements referred to in the remainder of this description can have only two states, and 1, unless the contrary is explicitly stated. A NOR gate has the property that the output is 1 as long as all inputs are . If any input is 1, the output goes to . Therefore, the output of the NOR gate 8 is 1 until an alarm signal drives one of the eight inputs to 1 at which time the output goes to . The latch 81 shown in dotted lines is typically a Motorola MC14 44B Quad NAND R S Latch. A copy of this publication is being filed with this application. The designation Quad indicates that there are four such latches shown in Figures 4 and 5 and typically they would be the four latches located on this IC. A NAND R S latch has the property that a momentary transition from 1 to on one of the inputs produces an output level that remains at this level until an appropriate level change at one of the inputs causes it to change to the other level, hence the name latch. The change can be momentary and the condition is latched in until changed. The top input to latch 81 may be driven from the output of NOR gate 8 , via inverter 82 and NAND gate 83. When the top input to latch 81 is driven as just explained to a level by the output of the NOR gate 8 , the output shown on the right side of the dotted rectangle is driven from to 1. The output stays at this level until driven to by the appropriate signal to the other input as will be described later. An output level of 1 usually represents a voltage level of about 4.5 to 5. volts. This is an appropriate voltage to turn on one or more of the green LED s 29, 3 and 31. LED 29 will always come on when alarmed and LED s 3 and 31 will come on when switches 7 and 71, respectively, are closed and the circuit to those switches is energized. The output signal is also sent to the circuits of Figure 4 through line C. Wire A of Figure 4 connects to wire A of Figure 5, and wire C of Figure 4 connects to wire C of Figure 5. The signal on line C is applied to three logic elements shown in Figure 4 the NAND gate 52, the inverter 67 and the inverter 54. The function of each of these elements will be described below. The NAND gate 52 is typically a Motorola MC14 12B Dual 4 Input NAND Gate. The designation Dual indicates that there are two identical gates on a single IC. A NAND gate has the property that the output is at a 1 level if any one of the inputs is a level. When all inputs are at a 1 level, the output goes to a level. NAND gate 52 is used to turn on the audible alarm 68. As long as the level on the C line is at the other three inputs to the NAND gate 52 will have no effect on the output. However, when the signal on the C line goes to 1,control goes to the other inputs of gate 52. Timer 51 controls one of the other inputs to NAND gate 52. Timer 51 typically is an Intersil ICM7555. In this application it is used as a monostable pulse generator. The trigger applied to pin 2 of the timer 51 is obtained from the clock 41 output consisting of a pulse once per minute. A resistor and capacitor of the Intersil ICM 755 device are chosen to produce a pulse of approximately 15 seconds width. The positive output pulse from pin 3 of the timer 51 is applied to one of the inputs of gate 52, hereinafter referred to as the center input. Thus, for the first 15 seconds of each minute the center input of gate 52 is at a 1 level. Thus, when the C line is at a 1 level, control of the output of gate 52 is transferred to the top input for the first 15 seconds of each minute. The top input to gate 52 is obtained from pin 13 of the clock 41. This signal consists of a composite of a 1 24 Hz, a 16 Hz and a 2 Hz signal. When converted into sound waves by the transducer 68, it produces a very distinctive alarm sound. When the other three inputs to gate 52 are at a 1 level, this signal from the clock 41 controls the output of gate 52 which is applied to the audible sound generator or transducer 68. Thus, the signal will sound for the first 15 seconds of each minute as long as the signal on the C line is at a 1 level. Instead of applying the electrical alarm signal generated by the clock 41 to the audible signal generator 68, the electrical signal at the output of NAND gate 52 could be applied to the input of a hearing aid earphone so that the signal would be audible to a person with a hearing impairment. Alternatively, the output of NAND gate 52 may actuate a voice synthesizer, or the loud speaker of a radio or television set. The output of the voice synthesizer would feed the earphone of a hearing aid or a loudspeaker with instructions for taking the medication. Alternatively, the signal fed to audible signal generator 68 could start a recorder which would emit audible voice instructions to the patient as to how to take the medication. The signal on the C line is also applied to the inputs of the two inverters 54 and 67. These inverters are typically Motorola MC14 49UBV Hex Inverter Buffers. An inverter has the property that it changes the input to its complement at the output. Thus, if the input is at a 1 level, the output is at a level and vice versa. The Hex designation indicates that there are six inverters on a single IC. Thus, all the inverters used in Figures 4 and 5 can be located on a single IC. When the level on the C line goes to a 1 level as a result of the alarm signal, the top input to latch 55 is driven from a 1 level to a level. The output of the latch 55 is driven to a level which is applied to the top input of NAND gate 56 insuring that its output is at a 1 level. The inverter 6 output is at a level and the red LED 57 is off. At the same time, the lower input 67a of latch 58 is driven to a level by the signal on the C line applied to this input through the inverter 67. This drives the output of latch 58 to a 1 level which is applied to the bottom input of NAND gate 56. This transfers control of gate 56 to the top input. If the alarm is not answered by opening and closing the lid of the applicable compartment, during the ten minute period following the initiation of the alarm, a signal from the 1 divider 42 will drive the bottom input of latch 55 to a level through inverter 53 which will cause the output of latch 55 to go to a 1 level. The output of NAND gate 56 will go to a level and the red LED 57 will be turned on through inverter 6 and the sound emitted by transducer 68 will be turned off. If, however, the alarm is answered by opening and closing the lid 18 of the compartment 14, the switch 22 is closed, momentarily, driving the top input 58b of latch 58 to a level. The output 58a of latch 58 and the input of gate 56 will be driven to a level and the red LED 57 will not be turned on. If the lid 18 of the compartment 14 is opened and closed after the 1 minutes following the alarm, the red LED 57 will be turned off. The signal on the output 58a of latch 58 also appears on the A line. Reference to Figure 5 shows that this signal on line A is applied to the bottom input of latch 81. The A line will go to a level when the lid 18 of the compartment 14 is closed. This will drive the output of latch 81 to a level and the green LED s 26, 3 , and 31 will be turned off. At the same time the C line will go to a level turning off the audible alarm 68. The entire system will be returned to a condition of readiness to accept the next alarm signal and the entire process will repeat as described above. There is a circuit to allow the user of the pill box to disable the alarm, on any of the compartments 14, 15, 16 and 17, and any such compartment so disabled will be automatically restored to its normal operating condition at the next occurrence of the 24 hour alarm signal at 7 AM. The reason for this is that it is probable that under some circumstances the patient would not want the alarm to sound during the night. However, in the event the patient failed to restore the system to its normal operating condition the next morning it is desired that this would be accomplished with components 82 to 87 Figure 5 . The night shut off circuit operates in the following manner. Under normal conditions, i.e. the alarms set and not disabled, the right hand input 83a to NAND gate 83 is held positive by the output of the latch 84. It is assumed that a 24 hour signal on line 69 has occured since the circuits for all compartments 14, 15, 16 and 17 of the system are disabled. The disabling signal would have driven the bottom input to latch 84 from a 1 to a state. Under this condition any signal applied to the input of NOR gate 8 through one of the switches 72 to 79 will cause the input of NAND gate 83 to go to a 1 state, driving the top input of latch 81 to . The sequence of events described above will then occur. If and when it is desired to disable the circuit from a given compartment, for example compartment 14, night switch 85 is closed momentarily, causing the output 83a of latch 84 to go to . Under this condition the output of the NAND gate 83 will be 1 and will be unaffected by any input on its left hand input 82a. This condition will persist until the occurence of the 24 hour alarm signal on line 69 see Fig. 5 . The 24 hour signal on line 69 Fig. 5 , resets latch 84 for normal daytime operation. Resistor 87 insures that the top input to latch 84 is at 1 until switch 85 is closed. When the box is initially set it is only necessary to insure that the 24 hour signal occurs at the desired time in the morning in this illustration at 7 AM. In the preferred form of Figures 2 and 3, the components 7 to 87 incl., 29, 3 , 31 and 69a are used in conjunction with compartment 14. A duplicate set of all of these parts 7 to 87 incl., 29, 3 , 31 and 69a is used for each of the other compartments 15, 16 and 17. This duplicate set for compartment 15 is partially shown in Figure 5 by reference numbers 92 to 1 incl. Reference number 1 1 shows certain wires that feed the duplicate set for compartment 16, and the duplicate set for compartment 17. The electrical circuitry used in conjunction with Figure 1 is apparent from the foregoing. The embodiment shown in Figure 1 may be used when the patient takes a single medication from time to time. If the medication is in the form of pills, they are placed in container 12, and a switch 11 is momentarily closed when lid 1 is screwed or otherwise placed on the container 12. The circuitry of Figures 4 and 5 is used with Figure 1 except that the duplicate circuitry 92 to 1 1 incl. of Figure 5 is omitted. The pill container 12 of Figure 1 may be used by a patient who must take a given pill periodically. Assume that the pill is to be taken at four hour intervals, the patient will close switch 75. As a result, the audible signaling device transducer 68 and one or more of signal lights 29, 3 and 31 will be energized every four hours, starting at 7 AM. After the 7 PM pill, the patient may momentarily depress switch 85 to deactivate the system until 7 AM. If the patient obeys the commands of the system by, in response to each emission of an audible signal by transducer 68, promptly a opening the container b taking the number of pills indicated by signal lights 29, 3 , 31, and c screwing lid 1 on the container momentarily closing switch 11 , the repeat audible warnings and the illumination of red LED 57 will not occur. However, if the patient fails to open the container 12 and take a pill, the back up warning system will be activated as follows As explained above, there will be repeat audible warnings from transducer 68 for the first fifteen seconds of every minute, and after ten minutes the red light 57 Figs. 1 and 4 will be turned on. Once a week, the re load signal light 66 is illuminated, and after reloading container 12 with pills the switch 64 is momentarily closed to turn off signal light 66 until it comes back on one week later. The device of Figure 1, employs the circuitry 41 to 5 incl., 61 to 66 incl., and 69a, which energizes signal light 66 at 7 AM once a week thereby instructing the patient to reload container 12 with pills, as explained in conjunction with Figures 2 and 3. The patient sets one of switches 72 to 79 incl. to designate the time period between the taking of a given pill during the day. At each indicated time, pills from container 12 are to be taken as in the case of Figures 2 and 3. The audible signal 68, and one or more of signal lights 29, 3 and 31 Figure 5 are illuminated at the aforesaid various times during the day, as explained above as well as in conjunction with Figures 2 and 3. In the form of Figure 1, switch 11 of Figure 1 corresponds to switch 22 of Figure 4 switches 23, 24 and 25 being omitted in this modification. Since switch 11 switch 22 in Fig. 4 closes momentarily when the lid or cap 1 is screwed onto container 12, the latch 58 will be reset, as explained in conjunction with Figures 2 and 3, and turns off a the audible signal 68 and b whichever one or ones of the signal lights 29, 3 and 31 which are on. One, two or three of signal lights 29, 3 and 31 may be illuminated every pill taking time, depending on the settings of manually operable switches 7 and 71. Similarly, at pill taking time LCD 69a will be displayed. It too will be turned off when lid 1 is screwed onto container 12. The 24 hour period of divider 5 is preferably once every 24 hours and may be set to run from 7 AM one day to 7 AM the next day. To set the system to disperse Pill A in compartment 14 at four hour intervals starting at 7 AM, the patient depresses four hour switch 75 associated with compartment 14. Similarly, to set the system to dispense Pill B in compartment 15 every six hours the user would depress switch 96. Likewise, to set the system to dispense Pill C in compartment 16 every 12 hours, the patient would depress that switch of the duplicate set assigned to compartment 16, corresponding to switches 78 and 98 of Figure 4. In similar fashion, to dispense Pill D from compartment 17, the patient would depress that switch of the duplicate set assigned to compartment 17, corresponding to switches 79 and 99 of Figure 4. The switches 7 and 71, and various switches of the duplicate sets would also be closed, as required to indicate the quantity of each pill which the patient should take each time the alarm sounds. Let it be assumed that after taking the 7 PM pills, the patient wishes to turn off the device for the night, the night switches for all four compartments 14, 15, 16 and 17, corresponding to night switch 85 of Figure 5, are momentarily closed. The system is now deactivated and no alarm will sound and no light banks will be illuminated until at least 7 AM when a signal appears on wire 69. The deactivation resulting from the momentary closure of switch 85 sets latch 84 to disable gate 83 and sets latch 81 to forbid the appearance of a signal on wire C. This precludes any current reaching light bank 29 31. It also precludes gate 52 from allowing current to pass to audible signaling device 68. The patient may wish to take Pill B every six hours during the night but not take the other pills after 7 PM. In such case, night switch 85 associated with compartment 14 would be closed momentarily. This would deactivate the system,until 7 AM, insofar as it relates to compartment 14. The systems relating to compartments 16 and 17 are not scheduled to produce signals between 7 PM and 7 AM. At 7 AM the system will be reactivated in view of the 24 hour signal on wire 69 energizing inverter 86. If one or both of compartments 16 and 17 were scheduled to produce alarms during the night they could be turned off by depressing their night switches 85. If the patient promptly takes the various pills as indicated by the system, the back up warnings will not be given. However, if the patient does not open and close one or more of lids 18, 19, 2 and 21, as indicated by the system, the back up audible and visible warnings will occur as described in conjunction with Figure 1. There is the possibility that one or more of the switches described above may be inadvertently operated. To avoid this possibility the switches are of the push button type and the push buttons are of small diameter, for example in the range of . 5 to .15 inches 0.13 0.38cm in diameter and protective ribs are positioned on both sides of a row of switches. Thus, in Figure 1, the switches 7 to 79 incl., are of the push button type, are less than 1 8 inch 0.3cm in diameter, and are located in a row. The ribs 1 2 and 1 3 extend outwardly from the casing 12 a greater distance than the switches 7 to 79. Moreover, the ribs 1 2 and 1 3 are closely adjacent to the row of switches 7 79. Thus, the only practical way to operate the switches is by use of a rod of small cross section that will readily fit between the ribs 1 2 and 1 3. The switches will, therefore, not be operated by normal handling of the casing 12. All of the switches of Figures 2 to 5 are also located in rows protected by ribs 1 2 and 1 3. The medication need not be in the form of pills, for example, a small bottle of eye drops may be placed in one of the compartments. The latches referred to above are a species of bistable device. Both the apparatus of Figure 1, and that of Figure 2, is portable and may be carried in a pocketbook. The electrical apparatus Figures 4 and 5 may be supplied with power from a small battery not shown . A conventional device for emitting signals when the battery needs replacing may be employed if desired. The various switches shown in Figures 4 and 5 are mounted on the casing 13 of Figure 2. Preferably, the switches relating to any given one of compartments 14 to 17 incl. are grouped adjacent to that compartment.
