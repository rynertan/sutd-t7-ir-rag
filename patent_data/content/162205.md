# Process for controlling the molten metal level in continuous thin slab casting.

## Abstract
A process for controlling the molten metal level in con tinuous thin slab casting in which molten metal 22 poured from a large sized tundish 24 into a small sized tundish 26 through a sliding nozzle 25 is caused to overflow from the small sized tundish for casting through a tiltable casting spout 28 into a twin belt type continuous casting machine 29 is disclosed. The process comprises measuring the level of molten metal on the casting machine 29 to provide a deviation signal representative of a deviation of the level of the molten metal from a target value and adjusting a directly influencing factor on the molten metal level, such as the degree of inclination of the casting spout 28 or the pulling speed of the molten metal according to the deviation signal. Preferably, the process further comprises measuring the di rectly influencing factor to provide a deviation signal repre sentative of the directly influencing factor relative to the normal value, and adjusting the degree of opening of the sliding nozzle 25 of the large sized tundish according to the deviation signal to regulate the pouring rate into the small sized tundish.
