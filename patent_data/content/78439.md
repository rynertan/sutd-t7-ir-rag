# READ ONLY STORAGE USING A FOUR STATE CELL

## Abstract
A bipolar ROM read only memory or ROS read only storage system in which the array devices 20 embody four different, two terminal, device forms low barrier Schottky diodes standard or high barrier, Schottky diodes junction diodes and no diodes thereby to make possible four levels of storage for each cell. This effectively doubles the informa tion content for an array 10 with little increase in the array size.
