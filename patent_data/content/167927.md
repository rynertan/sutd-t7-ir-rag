# Close clearance seal for rotatable therapeutic catheters.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a seal for a rotatable therapeutic catheter, such as a motor driven therapeutic catheter. The seal is made of a drive shaft 10 which extends through an elongated bushing 28 . The combined drive shaft and bushing form a low friction axle bearing combina tion such that there is little friction between them. In addition, the long restrictive path between the drive shaft and the bushing serves to prevent leakage between them.
