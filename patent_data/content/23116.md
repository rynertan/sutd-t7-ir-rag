# PWM inverter device.

## Abstract
An inverter device operating under pulse width modulation PWM principle in which chopping pulse A₄ is formed by crossing points of a triangle waveform A₃ and a function waveform A₆ in order that pulse width of the inverter input current decreases towards later half of pulse train in each period of pulse repetition series so as to make the average input current for each one of the pulses substantially constant.
