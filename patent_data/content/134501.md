# Foamable polymer blend compositions.

## Abstract
Compatible blends of an ethylene methacrylic or ethylene acrylic acid dipolymer or a terpolymer with n butyl or isobutyl acrylate with an ethylene X Y terpolymer, where X is vinyl acetate or an alkyl acrylate and Y is CO or SOâ‚‚, with an elastomer, a blowing agent, and a curing agent can be readily formed into stiff foamed articles having very good physical properties, especially split tear and tensile strength. The foamed articles are useful, among others, in such applications as footwear, insulation, shock absorbance, floatation devices, seals and, gaskets.
