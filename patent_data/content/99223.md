# ELECTROMECHANICAL RELEASE MECHANISM

## Abstract
A mechanism eg for holding open a fire door A against the action of a closing force X includes a pivoted latch bar 21 in a wall mounted unit engaging a roller 27 attached via spring biased arms 29 to the door. The bar 21 carries an armature 26 which is normally held in the latching position by an electromagnet 20 . In the event of a fire the magnet 20 is de energised to allow the latch bar 21 to pivot to an unlatching position broken line in which the roller 27 rolls down under the nose 24 of the bar under the action of the closing force X , and allows the door to close.
