## Description
This invention relates to a method for producing a desired compound in a bacterial cell population and to a set of DNA constructions useful therefor. As explained in more detail below DNA constructions in accordance with this invention are adapted for transfecting a host bacterial cell, for integrating a gene determining a growth promoting function in the chromosome of the host cell, and for controllably excising the gene therefrom to yield DNA incapable of replicating in the cell. In this way the growth promoting function is controllably lost from the cell. One instance in which controlled cessation of a cell function is useful involves microbial fermentation of a desired product. To achieve a desired microbial cell population, the cells are allowed to undergo an exponential log phase of cell growth. When a suitable cell population density is reached, it may be advantageous to halt cell growth so that cellular resources and metabolic energy are not diverted from the production of the desired compound. Ideally, a mechanism to achieve this goal should be absolute, so that some cells in the population will not circumvent the growth control and overgrow the culture. One way to control cell growth is by limiting the availability of one or more nutrients that the cell requires for growth. Once the limited amount of a nutrient is used, cell growth ceases. Cells may be mutated or engineered so that they require a nutrient in order to grow. For example, if the nutrient is a particular amino acid such as tyrosine, cells are mutated or engineered to create a defect in the cell s natural pathway for synthesizing that amino acid. The cells then may be provided the amino acid in an amount selected to allow them to achieve a desired cell population when the cells reach that population, they become starved for the amino acid and cannot grow. According to a first aspect of the present invention, we provide a method for producing a desired compound in a bacterial cell population, characterised in comprising the steps of In a second and alternative aspect thereof, the invention provides a set of DNA constructions adapted for transfecting a host bacterial cell, for integrating a gene determining a growth promoting function in the chromosome of said host bacterial cell, and for controllably excising the gene therefrom to yield a DNA molecule incapable of replicating in said cell, whereby said growth promoting function is controllably lost from said cell, said DNA constructions being characterised in comprising In preferred embodiments the gene to be integrated and controllably excised codes for a cell growth function that reduces the yield of a desired compound either by converting the desired compound into other compounds or by shunting intermediates away from the desired compound s biosynthetic pathway. Thus, the gene is integrated in the host cells to improve growth, and then it is excised and lost from the cells to improve compound production. For phenylalanine production, the gene on the excision vector preferably is one or more of The invention is particularly useful where the organism synthesizes the desired compound from a precursor that also appears on a synthetic pathway that is essential for cell growth. In such organisms, an enzyme catalyzing a biochemical reaction occurring after one of these common precursors could shunt the precursors toward cell growth and away from production of the desired compound. The cell growth pathway is enabled by allowing expression of the enzyme that shunts the precursor into the growth pathway during the log growth phase. By disenabling the expression of genetic material encoding the enzyme for the cell growth pathway after a suitable cell population density has been reached, the common precursor will be channelled into the synthesis of the desired compound, and cell growth will cease due to the removal of an essential enzyme. If a small number of cells continue to express the genetic material necessary for growth, they might overgrow their disenabled siblings and reduce the product yield. This problem is avoided because, once deleted from the bacterial chromosome, the genetic material coding for the growth function is unable to replicate autonomously. The gene eventually will dilute out as the cells continue to divide, and it will be lost from the cells completely. Since regions on the vector that are substantially homologous with the DNA of the host chromosome are avoided, the probability of the vector reintegrating in the host chromosome through a homologous recombination event is extremely low. Thus, integration can only occur by site specific recombination at the desired Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments. We first describe the drawings. Fig. 1 is a flow chart of the synthesis of the vector xKB803. Figs. 2 10 represent intermediate steps in the construction of the vector.

The preferred embodiment described below relates to one specific system useful in microbial production of phenylalanine. Specifically, the system enables controlled expression of the The preferred embodiment described below is only one example of the use of the invention to provide controlled expression of cell growth functions which may be detrimental once the desired cell population has been achieved and compound production has begun. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are a great number of possible cell growth functions that can be controlled using the invention to enhance production of a desired compound. The excision vector comprises DNA from a lysogenic bacteriophage lambda, such as cI₈₅₇S₇, which encodes functions for phage integration excision and lysogenic control. DNA encoding functions for phage replication, virion formation and host lysis has been deleted. cI₈₅₇S₇ contains a mutant allele of the Virtually any gene of interest can be cloned into the unique restriction site XhoI in Fig. 11 , and integrated in a host chromosome. The vector is constructed by the steps represented in Fig. 1. The appropriate cI₈₅₇S₇ DNA fragment can be obtained by digesting pKB720 Fig. 2 or eKB101 ATCC 39855 both of which are fully described in U.S.S.N. 655,361, filed September 27, 1984, the disclosure of which application is hereby incorporated by reference with EcoRI and PvuII. The ends of the fragment are converted into KpnI sites by using linkers, and cloned into the KpnI site of pKB742 Fig. 4 yielding pKB757 Fig. 5 . pKB742 is derived from pBR322 Fig. 3 the entire sequence of which is described in Maniatis pKB757 is treated with BglII to remove the genes The The The two largest fragments from the BglII digest of pKB757 are rejoined to yield pKB760 Fig. 6 . Conversion of a unique TthlllI site to a XhoI site by means of a linker results in pKB767 Fig. 7 . It has been found that the The leftward operon containing the genes N, Vectors pKB800 and pKB803 have been deposited with the American Type Culture Collection under the ATCC accession numbers 53019, and 53020. xKB803 is recircularized and transformed into an Integration of the excision vector can be improved to some extent when the transformed cells are co infected with an integration deficient helper phage at a multiplicity of infection of 5 10. This improvement may occur because the excision vector xKB803 cannot express its One suitable helper phage is λimm434b104 shown in Fig. 13. Many other helper phages are suitable in that they are not subject to repression by Helper phage assisted integrants are selected at 30 C as Derivatives of The production of phenylalanine using the vector is outlined in the flow chart in Fig. 16. Derivatives of The present invention may be embodied in other ways. For phenylalanine production, excision vectors containing For producing threonine, genes relating to isoleucine biosynthesis are useful for cell growth and hinder product production. For tryptophan production, the following genes are useful for cell growth and hinder product production For proline production, a gene coding for proline oxidase can be included on the excision vector. The above mentioned genes can be cloned by standard techniques, e.g. from
