# Apparatus and method for solid liquid separation by vaporization and condensation.

## Abstract
A continuous process of spreading a film of a solids liquid admixture over walls of a chamber 1 , maintaining a saturated vapor atmosphere within the chamber, vaporizing liquid of the film to provide the saturated vapor and solids, discharging the saturated vapor and solids from the cham ber and condensing the discharged vapor is effected in a hollow module having two spaced apart chambers 1, 4 , one within the other, and means 7 to move saturated vapor from the inner chamber to the outer chamber.
