# Device for conveying goods or persons along a guide rail.

## Abstract
A device intended for the conveyance of goods utilising a guide rail 2 as a goods conveying track, and an organ 4 driven electrically or in some other way and capable of interacting with the goods. The organ 4 exhibits two wheels 8,9 capable of interacting with the opposite sides of the guide rail 2 in relation to which the point of contact 20 of the weight of the goods is located to the side of the wheels 8,9 and the guide rail 2 . The two wheels 8,9 are connected together so as to be driven in synchronism by a driving motor 14 . The distance between the driving sur faces of the driving wheels facing the guide rail is selected so as to match the shape of the driving surfaces in such a way that the space formed between the driving surfaces matches the profile of the guide rail 2 . One of the wheels is divided into two parts 91,92 and has the parts held together by spring pressure 93 .
