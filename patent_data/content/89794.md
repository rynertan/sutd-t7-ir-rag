# VEHICLE SUSPENSION SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A suspension system for a driver s compartment of a vehicle, for example, a cab of a commercial vehicle, has a plurality of suspension units R₁ R₄ providing soft suspen sion characteristics for the driver s comfort, and means E for selectively stiffening their suspension characteristics in accordance with certain kinds of movement of the vehicle. These kinds of movement include pitch, roll and bounce, and the struts are selsectively stiffened in order to counter the effect on the driver s compartment of these movements. Each suspension unit may include a volume of gas 4 in communication with a gas spring 7 , from which it can be isolated to stiffen the suspension characteristics. The means for selectively stiffening the units is preferably an electronic control system E which is operative in response to the movements of the vehicle, and includes solenoid operated valves V₁ V₄ to control communication between the units R₁ R₄ and the gas spring 7 . The system may be supplied from an air brake system of the vehicle.
