# Catalyst components and catalysts for the polymerization of alpha olefins.

## Abstract
Catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins, comprising the solid product of the reaction of a halogenated Ti compound and of an electron donor compound not con taining active H atoms with the solid product of the reaction between an electron donor compound containing active H atoms and a Mg dihalide obtained by decomposition, with halogenating agents other than the above halogenated Ti compound, of product d obtained from the reaction between a metallorganic Mg compound of formula R
