# COHERENT DISTRIBUTED SENSOR AND METHOD USING SHORT COHERENCE LENGTH SOURCES

## Abstract
A distributed sensor system including an optical source 100 having a short coherence length for optionally continu ously monitoring each sensor in the system. In one preferred embodiment, an array of fiber optic sensors 110 are or ganized in a ladder configuration, with the sensors positioned in spaced relation and defining the rungs of the ladder. Light transmitted through the sensors is multiplexed onto a return arm 114 of the ladder, with sensor spacing being such that interference between light from different sensors is prevented. The multiplexed signals are received by an optical fiber receiver 118, 120 which couples the multiplexed light with an inter fering optical reference signal to produce a phase difference signal representing conditions influencing selected sensors. Embodiments are disclosed for use of either pulsed or continu ous wave light sources. In another preferred embodiment, the sensors comprise a plurality of Mach Zehnder interferometers 404, 406 connected in series configuration by a common op tical fiber 402 , which provides multiplexed output signals from the sensors to a plurality of Mach Zehnder interferom eters 418, 420 comprising receivers. The optical path length differences between the arms 409, 410, 411 and 412 of each of the sensors 404, 406 are selected to prevent interfer ence between the multiplexed sensor output signals from vari ous sensors. The optical path lengths through the sensors 404, 406 and receivers 418, 420 are structured so that each receiver 418, 420 produces a phase difference signal relating to conditions affecting light transmission through a specific sensor 404, 406 . A phase and amplitude modulation technique is disclosed for providing heterodyned output sig nals from the dristributed sensor system.
