# N,3 disubstituted 2 oxindole 1 carboxamides as analgesic and antiinflammatory agents.

## Abstract
Certain 2 oxindole 1carboxamide compounds having an acyl substituent at the 3 position, and also further substi tuted on the carboxamide nitrogen by an alkyl, cycloalkyl, phenyl or substituted phenyl group, are inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase CO and lipoxygenase LO enzymes, and are useful as analgesic and antiinflammatory agents in mammalian subjects. These 2 oxindole 1 carboxamide com pounds are of particular value for ameliorating pain in human patients recovering from surgery or trauma, and alleviating the symptoms of chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ostoarthritis, in human subjects. Certain 2 oxind ole 1 carboxamide compounds unsub stituted at C 3, but having a substituent on the carboxamide nitrogen, are useful as intermediates to the analgesic and antiinflammatory agents of the invention.
