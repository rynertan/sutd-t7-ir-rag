# Improvements relating to communication over noisy lines.

## Abstract
A line network communication system transmits coded data signals on a base band carrier signal and includes a receiver capable of recovering the coded data signals from transmitted signals. The receiver operates in a search mode initially, in which a series of data signals received at 13 is compared, at different relative phases, with a series of coded reference signals using an arrangement of shift registers 12, 15 and an exclusive OR gate 11 . The reference signals are generated by a coder 1 under the command of a central control unit 3 . The control unit monitors the results of comparisons and varies, by means of a shifter circuit 6 , the relative phase of compared signals until at least one comparison indicates a degree of correlation exceeding a threshold value. The control unit then operates, in a tracking mode, to verify that said degree of correlation is maintained for a preset number of subsequent comparisons and in dependence on a successful verification enters a locking mode. The control unit maintains a selected phase difference between compared series while the degree of correlation exceeding said threshold value exists.
