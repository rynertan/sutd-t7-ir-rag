# Nestable and stackable box.

## Abstract
Nestable and stackable box comprising a rectangular bottom 1, two side walls 2 3 and a back wall 4, which walls diverge, starting at the bottom, a lowered front wall 5 and a fold away stacking support 34. The front 6 7 of each side wall has been bevelled off to make an obtuse angle 8 9 with the top 10 11 of the side wall, and each side wall has been provided with an opening 14 15 near its front, the plane 18 19 bounding the opening at the front being totally before the perpendicular dropped from the vertex of the obtuse angle 8 9 between the front and the top of the side wall upon the bottom 1. The part of the wall section 20 between the opening 14, 15 and the front 7 of the side wall 2 3 goes outward as it goes downward, to a distance of one to three times its horizontal wall thickness W, to form a ridge 21 having a width of one to three times the horizontal wall thickness. An inside protrusion 22 has been provided on said ridge 21 and against the outward going wall section, and on the outside of the side wall and below the opening outside protrusion 24, the underside 25 of the outside protrusion being at a distance of at least one third of the side wall height beneath the ridge 21 and extending sidewards not further than the side wall thickness plus the nesting clearance, all this in such a way that in a nesting arrangement the outside protrusion falls behind the inside protrusion.
