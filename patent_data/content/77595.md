# Through flow transducer.

## Abstract
The invention pertains to a through flow transducer of the plate capacitor type to be built in into a tubing system, in which the through flowing liquid functions as dielectric. The electrodes of the capacitor are not opposite each other but axially juxtaposed, separated by a small but constant gap width so that a high sensibility can be obtained. Due to this high sensibility the transducer is suitable for various applications as dielectric shift detector when decomposing two or more immiscible liquids as indicator when mixing liquids to indicate that the correct concentration of the mixture components is obtained as quality meter for measuring possible fluctuations in the dielectric constant Îµ

## Description
Titel Through flnu. transducer of thecapacitor type. The invention relates to a through flow transducer of the capacitor type to be built in into a tubing system for capacitive and or conductivity measurements of a fluid flowing through the transducer, in which one electrode plate of the capacitor is formed by the housing of the transducer, said housing being tubular and earthed, whereas the other hot electrode of the capacitor is insulated with respect to ., the housing, A capacitive transducer for through flowing fluids is known.In such a transducer a rod shaped electrode is passed through the wall of the housing and extends into the fluid flowing through it, fluidsAike liquids, fluidized powder or granulated materials or the like. Such a rod shaped electrode constitutes, however, an obstacle in the flow of fluid. Further the rod s area acting as said one electrode of the capacitor is small and the distance from the rod to the opposite inner surface of the housing cannot be made infinitely small, because otherwise all kinds of solid particles in the fluid flow would stick in the narrow passage between the opposing electrode areas constituting this capacitor.Therefore herewith no great sensibility can be obtained, so that the known transducer can cnly be used for fluids having a clear and sharp shift in dielectric constants, such as for instance between oil and water. Simultaneously with or after the transducer with the rod shaped electrode, a transducer came into development in which the capacitor was formed by electrodes being located on either side of the coupling flange in the tubular system. So the transducer consisted of a tubular housing that by means of connecting flanges was placed at the joint of two tube sections of the tubing system, through which was flowing the fluid, of which the dielectric constant should be measured. The transducer housing being connected to an oscillator constituted the hot electrode, the tube sections on either side of the transducer constituted the cold , earthed electrode. The field strength lines traversed axially the gap between the flanges, by means of which the transducer and the tube sections were connected to each other.The gap width was therefore strongly depen dent on the clamping force by which the flanges were clamped together,With that transducer no precise and reliable results could therefore be obtained. Besides it is a great disadvantage that the housing of the trans ducer could not be earthed. An other disadvantage of the predecessor of the present transducer was that if incorporated in a plastics tubing system, the tube sections adjacent the transducer had to be coated at their ends with electrode material. Now it was again possible to earth the housing of the transducer, because now the tube sections were not automatically earthed. This construction has also the advantage that deposits on the electrodes will be formed much slower than in the transducer with rodshaped electrode, so that the maintenance costs decrease. The invention has for its object to provide a transducer whose sensibility is strongly enhanced and which therefore is able to detect the presence of traces of an other fluid, the being always a constant distance between the electrodes. In accordance with the invention, the capacitive transducer is characterized in that said latter electrode is tubular like said former electrode, and cooperates wholly or partly with saidxformer electrode, said two electrodes being separated from each other via a peripheral gap.Thus the transducer of the invention comprises the two electrode plates of a capacitor and is as such a complete unit so that. the assembling and. fabricating of this transducer can be done more simply. Moreover the housing can be earthed now. The gap or gaps formed are independent of the manner in which the transducer is mounted in a tubing system.So the electrode distance gap width is constant and can be made small to very small without enay risk of clogging. In the continuous process controlling in the chemical and the petroleum industry, where frequently fluids have to be decomposed, for example between oil and water and the like, or processes where various fluids have to be mixed, such as in perfumery industries, paint industries etc. , snally there is more than one shift or transition which have to be moneecred, for example in the fractionated distillation of petroleum, in whish petrol, kerosine, gas oil and lubricating oil are won, there are three shift1 jump or transient points or ranges involved.To monitor all three of them, in order to control them automatically, it imports to divide the latter electrode by means of axial and or peripheral insulating gaps into sub electrodes, which for the forming of sub capacitors cooperate mutually and or with the former electrode, and are connected to an individual processor. With the aid of these embodiments it is possible to work solely with capacitors whose electrodes are axially in alignemnt, or solely with capacitors whose electrodes are circumferentially juxtaposed, whereas combinations of the two embodiments are possible. In both embodiments the favourable circumstance occurs that on either side of a gap the electrodes constituting a capacitor, have a very small distance and that the capacitance value attains a maximum there, so that a high sensibility is obtained. Already the presence of slight traces of water in oil can influence the measured value of the dielectric constant, provided the traces do occur in the electrical field. Since these watertraces can be the precursor of the transient from oil to water, it is possible already in an early stage to cease the further pumping up of oil from the well. The measuring cell, after its incorporation into the tubing system, is connected to an alternating current bridge being driven by an oscillator. Though the hot electrode may be provided in insulating posi tion against the inner wall of the housing, incorporation within the housing is to be preferred, so that but little or nothing at all of the hot ring electrode protrudes. Therefore in accordance with the invention said latter electrode is received in an insulating manner within a recess in the former electrode, facing the interior of the transducer.This measure can also be taken, when the hot electrode is an integral member, provided the recess be located near one qf the end faces of the housing. If the hot electrode is constituted of two or more parts, the recess can also be provided symmetrically in the housing. Since the fluids of which a parameter is to be measured have sometimes a great specific conductivity, so that short circuit between the various electrode plates could occur, or for other reasons, such as aggressive behaviour, corrosion etc., are unsuitable for direct contact with the electrodesurface, the planes of the former and latter electrodes both facing the transducer s interior, are coated with plastics or similar electrically insulating material. With a transducer according to the invention, where the hot electrode is divided into sub electrodes according to axial and or peripheral gaps, and is fabricated in this embodiment as a standard article, it can sometimes be desirable that this divided electrode be acting as one electrode. Accordingly means are provided to connect the various sub electrodes in which said latter electrode is divided, wholly or partly, tp reduce the number of sub electrodes. Not withstanding it is a great advantage of the sub dividing of the hot electrode into sub electrodes, that to each sub capacitor an individual oscillator with amplifier can be connected. When in this way two circuits are connected mutually, the amplification or gain is double. Still an other advantage is that to each of the oscillators connected to these sub electrodes a different frequency can be imparted.In this way it is possible for example to separate or decompose liquids, such as alcohol and similar volatile substances into their boiling range by means of the small differences in the dielectric constant, existing between the various distillate fractions. Yet an other application thereof is to mix alcohol with water sJ. in any ratio desired. An other practical application is as follows oil from a well t is not only in interfacial contact with sea water, but also with air.The dielectric constant of these three substances are t water 80, Er oil 2 and Er air 1. In a tank, in which these three mediums occur, there are two boundary layers, where a transient from one medium to the other medium can take place. In order to control saiE process, one cylinder half is connected to an oscillator with frequency F1 and the other cylinder half to an oscillator with frequency F It is possible to adjust the two circuits, of which these oscillators are a part, such that if the dielectric constant undergoes a predetermined modification, the position of certain valves is automatically changed, so that neither air nor water will enter in the definitive oil reservoir.It will be clear that in 7r2w of the c m differences between the dielectric constant of oil and Ar, the difference signal generated in this circuit must be amplified ore than in the other circuit, in order to effect switching activiYEs, That is the reason why the diametrical separation between the two cylinder halves of the horizontally arranged measuring tube is provided according to a a vertical plane running through the center line of the tube So there where the greatest concentration of electrical lines of force from said one electrode to the other occurs, the effect of a change in the dielectric constant will be relatively greatest. Entirely in this manner the invention is reversely applicable to indicate the precence of traces of oil in water. Resuming the principal applications of the through flow transducer according to the invention are the following a as transient detector for fluids with a great r difference. b as transient detector for fluids with a small q difference.c as quality meter for measuring possible fluctuations in d as transient detector to detect the transient between a large number of substance Qr gractions to be separated. In general the advantages of the transducer according to the invention can be indicated as follows 1. Slurry like substances can be measured well 2. There are no obstacles in the tubing system if compared with a transducer with rod electrodes 3. Small chance of pdlution 4. The transducer is applicable from vacuum up to about 500 bar 5. The transducer itself is a complete capacitor 6. The transducer can be mounted simply for example by dismounting a shutter in the tubing system and to replace same by the present measuring cell 7. The cell is built such that it functions independently as capacitor, so that the cell can also be placed in ducts without earthing facili ties, for example plastics conducts, plastics ropes, glass lined ducts. The invention will be explained in further detail below with reference to the embodiments shown in the figures of the enclosed drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 represent apparatus known in the prior art Figure 3 and following represent the measuring system according to the invention Figure 4 shows only part of the transducer according to the invention being an alternative embodiment of that according to fig. 3 Figure 5 is a cross section in which the hot electrode is dividedby means of axial gaps into four cylinder segments acting as subelectrodes Figures 6 9 show various applications of the invention Figures 10 14 show a practical realisation of the transducer according to the invention, in which Figures 10 and 11 represent the transducer in an elevational and in a side view and Figures 12 and 13 represent the same, but in cross section and at an enlarged scale. In figures 1 and 2 is shown the prior art in the domain of throughflow transducers of the capacitor type. In figure 1 is shown a transducer 10 which can be placed in a tubular system 11 between coupling flanges 13, drawn in dotted lines, and after the provision of a stuffing ring 15. The capacitor here is formed by a rod electrode 16 and a cylindrical electrode 17, being earthed at 18. The e rod electrode 16 is passed via an insulating through pass 19 through a bore 21 into the cylindrical electrode 17 and is connected to an oscillator 22 The rod electrode 16 protrudes into the interior 23 of the cylindrical electrode 17, through which is flowing vide arrow 24 the liquid or an other fluid, of which the dielectric constant is to be measured.The electric field 25 is formed between the end face 26 of the rod 16 and the opposite surface 27 of the cylindrical electrode 17. The cylindrical electrode 17 is considered here, as in the tubing system 11, to be metallic and therefore, during the assembling, an insulating ring 19 is provided between the cylindrical electrode 17, acting at the same time as an earthed housing, and the flange 13 of the tubing system 11. The distance D of the gap 28 between the end face 26 of the rod electrode 16 and the opposite surface 27 of the cylindrical electrode 17 cannot be given any small dimension in connection with possible cloggincrs in the narrow passage of the gap 28. The iNstrument is therefore insensible. In the through flow transducer 30 of figure 2 the capacitor is formed between the cylindrical electrode 37, acting as transducer housing and the adjacent tubing sections 32 of the tubing system 31, which, if made of steel, provide automatically for earthing, so that the housing 37 of the transducer 30, to which the oscillator 42 is connected via a pin 40, cannot be earthed. In contrast with the transducer 10 with rod electrode 16, the transducer 30 here does not comprise a complete capacitor, since the earthetglate must be provided externally by the tubing system 31, to which the transducer 30 is mounted. The electrical field 45 is not radial here, brr axial, due to the fact that the plates 37, 31 of the capacitor are not opposite each other, but are juxtaposed. The plate distance is defined b the thickness of the insulating ring for example a stuffing ring 35 between the flanges 33, 34 and is highly dependent on the force with which the flanges are compressed, When a transducer 30 is built in into a tubing system 31 of plastics, the automatical external earthing is lacking, and special measures should be taken therefore. The disadvantages mentioned before, which adhere to the known through flow meters 10, 30, are avoided in the transducer 50 according to the invention, as shown in figure 3. In the first place the capacitor is now again complete within the transducer. It acts as earthed cylindrical electrode 57. Against part of its inner surface 67 is resting, separated by an insulating layer 59, the so called hot electrode 56, being connected to the oscillator 62 via an insulated pin or cable 60. The traversing of the field lines 65 between the juxtaposed electrodes 56, 57 occurs entirely within the transducer 50. The distance between these electrodes is constant. If it is desired to provide the hot electrode symmetrically into a recess 68 of the earthed electrode, then the hot electrode 56 is made into two parts, which parts 56a, 56b, after assembling, can be again connected mutually. If the recess 68 is not provided symmetrically, but is shifted towards one of the end faces of the electrode 57, earthed at 58, then the hot electrode 56 need not be divided. This possibility is shown in figure 4, in which, however, only part of the transducer of figure 3 is represented, because the other components of the transducer have remained unchanged. Reverting to fig. 3, it is also possible in a symmetrical embodiment, that means an embodiment in two parts, to keep the sub electrode 56a, b separated, and to connect them each to an own oscillator and amplifier. In this way, two sub capacitors are obtained, each connected to an own processor circuit. In this situation two transient points can be watched when three various fluids are involved in the through flow measurement, for example the separation level between oil and water in a storage tank, and between oil and air Or it is possible to watch the limits of a transient range between two components of a mixture for in stance water and alcohol . One circuit responds to the upper limit and the other circuit responds to the under limit. When the outplksof the amplifiers are connected, doubling of the gain can be obtained, which is advantageous if the difference in the electric constant of both components of the fluid to be measured is not very great. To prevent a conductive through flowing liquid from making contact with the capacitor plates, the plates are coated with a layer of polytetrafluorethylene teflon 59. In this way the transducer can be used to monitor a certain adjusting range of an acid HCL, H2S04,H3PO4, etc ,which is thinned with wateren more transient or range limits are to be watched, it is to be preferred to divide the hot electrode 76 by axially directed gaps 69 into four sub electrodes 76a d, which cover each a circle arc of 90 vide figure 5. If necessary, further sub divisions can still be made. The e various above mentioned applications can be represented schematically in figures 6 9. In figure 6 the through flow transducer 50 is shown while used as transient detector, when two liquid components, having one transient point, occur in the through flowing fluid, being stored in a storage tank 80. For example a tank in which water 81 is at the bottom and oil 82 is resting on top of it. First water is flowing out of the tank in order to be guided via a suitable position of a valve 86, into the sewer or an other drain, This is continued until the moment is reached that the first oil droplets flow along with the water.Due to the great difference in dielectric constant, there is a sharp transient, which creates a strong controlling signal 88 in the processor 87 to modify the position of the valve 86, so that the valve let pass the oil to a supply reservoir or the like, where the oil is rather completely stripped off water seawater . The electrode 56 and the housing 57 are both earthed at 58. In figure 7 there is illustrated a settling tank 80 , which shows three transitions between componerts 81 84 of ti,e flowing fluid.As the figure clearly shows, the hot electrode consists of two sub electrodes 56a,b separated by axial gaps, said sub electrodes being connected to an own oscillator and amplifier 62a, b. If with these boundary layers there are transitions which are not sharp, because the 6 difference is small , the signals of the two amplifiers can be added by means of a suwming 7 ne 89, so that yet a relatively strong signal 88 is sent from the processor 87 to the valve 86 to put this in an other position when the supply of one component stops and the supply of an other component starts In the present case one may think of the followrg components Seawater 81, fresh water 82, oil 83 and air 84.The figure represents the situation in which at first the rather sharp transit nn between sea water and fresh water is to be detected. Here the housings57 is earthed at 58. In figure e is shown an arrangement with through flow transducer 50 according to the invention, in which the transducer is excecuted as quality meter, viz to detect variations in gr of one component fluid.This determination can be done such that a recorder or similar writing instmnentplaced behind the processor 87 registrates the fluctuations in Er only in a graph or in any other manner, so that conclusions can be drawn therefrom about the humogeneity of the fluid. This may be called a passive determination. In figure 8b a cross section of the housing 57 is drawn with field lines 66 between the sub electrodes 56a and b, if a voltage difference consists there between. Apart therefrom there exists an axial field range 60 not represented between electrode 57 and electrode 56, as appears from figures 3 and 4. In figure 9 an application is represented, in which the transducer 50 is being used as transient detector between five components 8185 in which in the case here represented four transients are monitored by four individual circuits, for which purpose, by means of a division in sub electrodesfour sub capacitors 56a d have been formed, having each its own oscillator 62a d, amplifier and processing circuit vide also figure 9b. Figures 10 13 show a practical embodiment of the through flow transducer according tp the invention. This embodiment comprises two connecting boxes 91, each for an individual processing circuit.It is to be noted in figures 10, 11 that a rather compact apparatus have been provided and for this reason can be arranged at the place of a shutter, provided somewhere in the tubing system. Figures 12, 13 show some details of the mechanical construction of the transducer according to the invention. The reference numbers used therein correspond to similar owÃ§Dnents in figures 3 9.
