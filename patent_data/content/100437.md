# A SINGLE PASS NOTCHING AND DRILLING TOOL AND METHOD OF DRILLING A BLAST HOLE THEREWITH

## Abstract
Disclosed is a single pass notching and drilling tool. The tool comprises an adaptor having a first threaded end for coupling with a power source, an opposed second threaded end, an enlarged diameter portion adjacent to the first threaded end and having a first abutment face and a mediate portion adjacent to the first axial abutment face and adjacent to the second threaded end. There is also a drill portion joined to the second threaded end of the adaptor and having a second axial abutment face. The tool further comprises a notching tool comprising a body having a central bore rotatably engaging the mediate portion of the adaptor. The notching tool is freely rotatable about the mediate portion independent of the rotation of the adaptor. The axial movement of the notching tool is bounded by the first and second axial abutment faces. Disclosed also is a method of drilling a blast hole with the single pass notching and drilling tool.
