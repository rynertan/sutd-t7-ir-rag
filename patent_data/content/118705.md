# METHOD OF PROVIDING A STONE CHIP RESISTING FINISH

## Abstract
A method of providing a stone chip resistant finish to the undersurface of an automobile is disclosed in which the undersurface is coated with a cationically initiated liquid mixture of cationically curable polyepoxide, polyhydric alco hol, and a photoinitiator for an ultraviolet activated cationic cure. The liquid mixture is applied at a resin solids content of at least about 50 and in a thickness to provide a cured coating of at least about 2 mils thick, and the wet coating is cured by exposing it to ultraviolet light. The automobile undersurface is desirably primed with a cross linked amine functional polymer primer, and the coating includes from 1 to 8 of a finely divided silica which prevents running but does not interfere with the ultraviolet cure.
