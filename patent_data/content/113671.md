# Apparatus and method for packaging a plurality of filaments or bundles of filaments and said packages.

## Abstract
An apparatus, method and package are provided for producing and winding bundles 16 of filamentary material to achieve good split efficiency of removal of the plurality of bundles 16 from the package for further processing, and to produce a package of wound bundles 16 of filaments having good edges. The apparatus has a filament forming means 10 , gathering means 18 to gather the filaments into a plurality of bundles 16 of filaments, rotatable winder 22 to attenuate and wind the bundles 16 , curved traversing guide 26 , reciprocating means 28 , and contacting means 34 . The curved traversing guide 26 has angularly opposing sides 36, 38 that converge to meet and extensions 40, 41 protruding from each angularly opposing sides 36, 38 . The extensions 40, 41 do not meet each other to form an opening for placement of the bundles 16 into the contain ment area 34 formed by the angularly opposing sides 36, 38 and extensions 40, 41 . The curved traversing guide 26 deposits the bundles 16 of filaments in essentially uncros sed, side by side relation, and cooperates with the contact ing means 34 at each end of a layer to deposite the bundles 16 in grouped relationship. Figure 2 shows essential features of the apparatus.
