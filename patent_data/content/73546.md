# Transmission, in particular for a motor vehicle.

## Abstract
A transmission, in particular for a motor vehicle provid ed with an infinitely variable V belt 14 transmission with a primary 2, 3 and a secondary pulley 8, 9 , each having two conical sheaves and comprising a primary 4 and a secon dary 12 hydraulic operating cylinder, respectively, for the axial displacement of at least one of the conical sheaves of each pulley. The transmission is provided with a hydraulic control valver 20 for the control of the transmission ratio, having a valve body 21 that can be displaced from an end position in which the valve body rests against a stop and in which fluid passages are opened for the discharge of fluid from the primary operating cylinder 4 and or the supply of fluid to the secondary operating cylinder 12 , to a centre position where fluid passages are closed, so that no supply of fluid to and discharge of fluid from at least one of the operating cylinders 4, 12 can take place. In case the trans mission is provided with hydrodynamic unit 60 and lock up means 64, 65, 66 for bridging the hydrodynamic unit 60 , there are control means 70, 71 for operating the lock up means depending on the position of the valve body between said end position and said centre position, to achieve an early lock up when driving away.
