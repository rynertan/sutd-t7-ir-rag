## Description
TITLE PROCESS FOR CONVERSION OF SULPHURIC ACID WASTE FOR EXAMPLE FROM TITANIUM DIOXIDE INTO USEFUL PRODUCTSThis invention relates to an improved process for the conversion of waste sulphuric acid, for example, from titanium dioxide plants, into useful products.In the process for manufacture of titanium dioxide TiO2 by the so called sulphate process there is one major disadvantage, namely, that very large quantities of dilute sulphuric acid, containing ferrous and titanyl sulphate as impurities, are produced as a by product and must be disposed of. The high iron content and low concentration make this by product acid un attractive to most sulphuric acid users.Disposing of the acid is a serious problem. Some TiO2 producers neutralise the acid before pumping it away, which is very costly. Others pump the acid out to sea, which is undesirable from environmental considerations.Another approach is to process the acid into a more useable form, for example by vacuum evaporation to recover concentrated sulphuric acid. The necessity for exotic materials of construction and the problem of fouling of heat exchangers due to the ferrous sulphate make this a very expensive process.A further approach is to convert the acid into useable products. One possibility is to react the waste acid with common salt to produce sodium sulphate and hydrochloric acid, i.e. the well knoa process. The overall reaction in thi given by EMI2.1 Sodium sulphuric sodium hyd chloride acid sulphate cThis reaction takes place in two stepsEMI2.2 sodium sulphate EMI2.3 The first reaction takes place at rel temperatures, i.e. of the order of 10 reaction requires higher temperatures 6000C. The process is normally carried concentrated sulphuric acid with salt a mixture, either in a special furnace e furnace or in a rotary kiln.Carrying out the salt cake process for example from the TiO2 process he acid poses a number of severe problem low typically around 20 by mass H2 S means that when the TD acid is heated large quantity of water is evaporated Thus the HC1 gas formed in reaction 2 is considerably diluted by the simultaneous evaporation of steam. If the resulting vapour is condensed, a solution containing only about 10 HCl is recovered. This is not a saleable product, and must be concentrated up to the normal commercial 30 HCl. However, this cannot be done by conventional distillation, because the azeotrope, containing about 21 HCl, is the highest concentration achievable.A second problem is that reaction 2 will be taking place in the liquid phase. Heating a liquid containing aqueous HCl requires exotic heat transfer materials such as tantalum or graphite. This makes a reactor for reaction 2 very expensive.A third problem is that two separate reactors will be required, one for the liquid phase reaction 2. and one for the largely solid phase in reaction 3 . This makes for a very expensive plant.The object of the preset invention is to provide a process for the conversion of waste sulphuric acid for example, from TiO2 production TD acid into saleable products, namely sodium sulphate and hydrogen chloride.The iron values can be recovered as pigment grade iron oxide at the same time. According to the invention a process of treating effluents containing sulphuric acid includes the steps of mixing the effluent with an alkali metal sulphate under conditions for the formation of the corresponding alkali metal bisulphate, drying the sulphate and then reacting it with an alkali metal halide to form the corresponding hydrogen halide. The term alkali metal bisulphate is intended to include mixtures and or coE s of the species M2S04, H2S04, MHS04, in which M is an alkali metal .In the preferred form of the invention the sodium compounds are used and the halide is chloride.If a high purity sodium sulphate is desired, the resulting sodium sulphate is dissolved in water, the pH is adjusted to about 6, and the precipitate of iron oxide is filtered off to yield a solution of sodium sulphate of high purity.The high purity solid sodium sulphate can be recovered by conventional, well known evaporation and crystallisation means. If pigment grade iron oxide is required, it can be obtained by washing the filtered iron oxide and heating to drive off the moisture.The reaction utilised by this invention is as follows EMI4.1 Since reaction between NaHSO4 and NaCl reaction 3 only takes place at elevated temperatures, the resultant mixture of NaHSO4 and NaCl can be heated to drive off the moisture without driving off any significant quantities of HC1. The dry mixture can then be heated in a single reactor to give off HC1 without significant dilution by water. If pigment grade iron oxide is required, the heating should be done under oxidising conditions..1. Anhydrous HC1 can be produced, or commercial 30 hydrochloric acid can be produced by direct absorption without further processing.2. Only one reactor is required. 3. No exotic materials are needed for heating the mixture.4. The pollution problems associated with waste TD acid are eliminated.5. Saleable products sodium sulphate, crude or detergent grade, anhydrous or 30 HCl, pigment grade iron oxide can be produced.The invention is described in more detail, but by way of example only, with reference to the drawing of a flow sheet accompanying this specification. Referring to the flowsheet Figure 1 , reference 1 designates the waste acid solution, which is mixed with recycled sodium sulphate 2 in a mixer 3 fran Where it is led into a drier or crystalliser 4 . The resulting solid is mixed with salt 5 in a second mixer 6 , and roasted in a roaster 7 . After cooling in a cooler 8 , a portion of the crude sodium sulphate is recycled to the first mixer, while the balance can be sold as such or further processed to purify it. Purification involves the addition of water 9 to dissolve it, and alkali 10 to raise the pH to around 6 to 7. This takes place in a dissolving tank 11 and the solution then passes to a filter 12 where iron oxide 13 is removed. The filtrate, a high purity sodium sulphate solution 14 , can be evaporated and crystallised as it well known in the art, to.produce detergent grade sodium sulphate.The hot gas 15 from the roaster passes to a quencher absorber column 16 where the HCl gas is absorbed to form commercial 30 HC1 solution.The iron oxide can be dried to produce pigment grade iron oxide.The invention is further illustrated by the following examples Example 1 50 g. of sodium sulphate was added to 100 ml, of TD acid containing 237 g l of H2SO4 and 13 g l FeSO4 and evaporated to dryness. 5,00 g of the solid product was mixed with 1,73 g of milled sodium chloride and heated at 6000C for 1i hours under oxidising conditions i.e. exposed to air. The resulting product contained 3,7 NaHSO4 and 0,1 Nazi. The product was dissolved in water, the pH adjusted to 6,5 and filtered. The resultant clear filtrate was evaporated to dryness and analysed. The dry product met the specification for detergent use, i.e. total heavy metal concentration was less than 5 ppm, and Na2SO4 content was higher than 99 . Example 2 100 g of sodium sulphate was added to 100 ml of TD acid containing 237 g l of H2Sp4 and evaporated to dryness. 5,00 g of the solid product was mixed with 1,03 g of milled sodium chlorideand heated at 6000C for lt hours under oxidising conditions.The resulting product contained 4,4 NaHSO4 and 0,1 Nazi. The product was dissolved in water, the pH adjusted to 6,5 with sodium carbonate, and filtered. The resultant clear filtrate was evaporated to dryness as before, and the dry product conformed to the detergent grade sodium sulphate specification.
