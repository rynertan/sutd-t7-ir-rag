# GRANULAR MEDIA FILTER

## Abstract
An improved filtering machine of the down flow type is disclosed wherein a particular section of a granular media filtration bed is isolated for backwashing while allowing filtration to proceed in the remainder of the bed. The filter machine includes a liquid holding tank containing a bed of granular media, structure permitting passage of filtrate through the bed from below, a flume for distributing influent liquid containing suspended solids across the bed for downward percolation therethrough, and a partitioning chamber mounted on a carriage mechanism which selective ly conveys the partitioning chamber across the surface of the bed. The partitioning chamber is reciprocatably insertable into the bed to isolate selected sections from the remainder of the bed. A pump is in communication with the partitioning chamber to draw liquid upward through the bed within the isolated section.
