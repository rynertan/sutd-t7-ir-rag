# Electromagnetic flowmeter and method for fabricating an electrode assembly for such a flowmeter.

## Abstract
A nonporous composite electrode, particularly suitable for use in electromagnetic flowmeters, includes a non metallic, electrically conductive element 24 consisting of a fused mass of polymeric material, such as perfluoroalkoxy pfa fluoropolymer, and carbon fibres. The electrode is fabricated by stacking alternating layers of polymeric film and carbon fiber paper, subjecting the assembly to sufficient heat and pressure to intermix the two components and bond them into a coherent mass, and fusing the resultant compo site material onto a mounting pin. Using a polymeric material compatible with the polymeric liner 33 of an electromagnetic flowtube allows the finished electrode to be fused into the liner 33 , again by application of heat and pressure, so as to achieve a seamless interface. This configuration virtually eliminates process fluid leaks around the electrode, while the electrode structure itself exhibits exceptional high temperature stability and corrosion resist ance.
