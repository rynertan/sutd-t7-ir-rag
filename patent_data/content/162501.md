# Video signal processing arrangement.

## Abstract
A video signal processing arrangement comprises an input 1 for receiving an input video signal and output 2 at which the processed signal is produced. The arrangement includes a vertical filter 3 , a horizontal filter 4 , a vertical interpolator 5 a horizontal interpolator 6 , a field store 7 and a control circuit 8 . The control circuit 8 produces con trol signals which are fed via paths 20,21,22 to the vertical and horizontal interpolators 5,6 and the field store 7 to re configure their positions in the signal processing chain in dependence on whether the television picture represented by the input video signal is to be squeezed or zoomed.
