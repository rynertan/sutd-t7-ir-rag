## Description
This invention relates to the new 2 hydroxyethyl trimethylammonium salt of l ethyl 3 carboxy 4 oxo 6,7 methylenedioxy 1,4dihydroquinoline, to a process for the preparation thereof and to pharmaceutical compositions containing it. The 2 hydroxyethyl trimethylammonium salt of l ethyl 3 carboxy 4 oxo 6,7 methylenedioxy 1,4 dihydro quinoline of the present invention may be prepared by reacting l ethyl 3 carboxy 4 oxo 6,7 methylenedìoxy 1,4 dthidro quinoline with 2 hydroxyethyl trimethylammonium hydroxide.Hereinafter, the salt obtained will be named as choline oxolinate. It is known that oxolinic acid chemically 1 ethyl 3 carboxy 4 oxo 6 ,7 methylenedioxy l 14dihydroquinoline possesses an ureterodisinfecting activity see the UnitedKingdom specification No. 1,076,828 however the resorption in the organism of this acid is very disadvantageous because of its low water solubility Now it has been found that the solubility of choline oxolinate in water higher than 1 g ml is signifi cantly better than that of oxolinic acid 6,5 ug ml . According to our results oxolinic acid does not form any stable salt with other amines, such as triethylamine, dicyclohexylamine or triethanolamine. On the basis of results of the investigations oxolinate, concerning the solubility, the resorption of choline has been supposed to be substantially more advantageous than that of the free oxolinic acid0 This supposition was completely verified by the in vivo resorption examinations carried out in mice see, Example 3. .The resorption of sodium oxolinate proved to be weaker than that of choline oxolinate of the present invention.The rapid resorption together with the good bioavailability makes possible on one hand to decrease the effective dose to a large extent, which leads to the diminution of side effects and to develop a pharmaceutical composition with a systemic action on the other hand. Up to now all the efforts failed to develop a sustained release oxolinic acid form on its slow resorption and rapid eliminations, however this could have been achieved by the choline oxolinate of the present invention because of its more rapid resorption. Choline oxolinate is siutable for the use in human medicine in the form of tablets, capsules, dragées, coated drawees, suppositories, solutions, syrups and injections, or in the sustained release form of any of the compositions mentioned above. Choline oxolinate active ingredient in compositions for the veterinary medicine may be used in addition to the forms employed in the human medicinelas active substance alone, or mixed or supported by any form to the feed. These pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared by the means of methods known in the art. The present invention is further illustrated in detail by the following Examples without any limitation thereto. Example 1 Preparation of the 2 hydroxvethyl trimethyl ammonium salt of 1 ethyl 3 carboxy 4 oxo 6,7 methylene dioxy 114, dihvdroquinoline choline oxolinate 2,61 g 001 mole of 1 ethyl 3 carboxy 4 oxo 6,7 methylenedioxy 1,4 dihydroquinoline were added to a solution containing 2.42 g 0.02 mole of 2 hydroxyethyl trimethylammonium hydroxide in 500 ml of water while stirring until the complete dissolution.The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, the crystalline residue was disolved in 50 ml of acetone and 4 5 ml of 96 ethanol were added during constant boiling, After cooling down to 0 5 C, the crystalline precipitate was filtered, washed with 2 x 5 ml of acetone and dried at 800C under reduced pressure for 2 hours to give 2.63 g 72.3 yield of the title product, m.p. 198 2000C determined by a Boetius melting point apparatus with a heating rate of 4 C min . The white, crystalline substance obtained dissolves well in water, ethanol or chloroform, while it is insoluble in acetone or ether.Characterization of choline oxolinate a Melting point Choline oxolinate melts at 198 2000C, while the melting point of oxolinic acid is 3150C. b Infrared spectrophotometry The infrared spectrum of both choline oxolinat e Figure 1 as well as of the starting oxolinic acid Figure 2 were taken in potassium bromide pellet on a Spectromom 2000 type device. It is obvious from comparison of the spectra that two different substances have been investigated. Example 2 Preparation of choline oxolinate 105 ml of a 50 solution of 2 hydroxyethyl tri methylammonium hydroxide choline base in methanol were dropped to a suspension containing 100 g of oxolinic acid in 200 ml of methanol stirred in a 1000 ml round bottom ground glass flask. The white suspension gradually became brown during the addition of choline base and finally, a dark red, clear solution was obtained. The solution was concentrated by a rotatory evaporating device to give 168 g of a crude product as a viscous oil which was crystallized under cooling.The resulting crude crystalline mass was recrystallized from 120 ml of isopropanol, the separated substance was filtered, washed with 2 x 10 ml of cold isopropanol and the white, crystalline substance was dried at 800C for 6 hours to give 87.4 g 63 5Ó yield of the title product. Example 3 Activity test Experiments Male CFLP mice with 25 g of an average body weight were used for these experiments. After starving for 12 hours the animals were given oxolinic acid or choline oxolinate, respectively in a volume of 2 ml 100 g of body weight as an aqueous suspension containing 1 iÓ of methylcellulose.The doses administered were 50 mg kg of body weight of oxolinic acid or 70 mg kg of body weight of choline oxolinate, respectively. These doses are equimolar as calculated for oxolinic acid. At 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours, respectively after treatment the animals were killed, their blood were centrifuged and the serum were used for the microbiological deteriination of the concentration, The examinations were carried out in three parallels. 50Xul of the serum were applied to an agar gel plate containing Proteus Mirabilis in a concentration of 107 germa ml.Simultaneously, a calibration curve was taken up with 50 l each of suspensions containing oxolinic acid in a concentration of 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 50 and 100 ug ml, respectively, The serum concentrations were calculated from the average of diameters of the inhibition zones by using the calibration curve. The calibration values are shown in Table I and inFigue 3, respectively. The results of determinations are sun.arized in Tables II and III and in Figure 4, respectively.Figure 4 shows the development of serum concentration as plotted against the time. It is obvious froi Figure 4 that oxolinic acid is substantially better resorbed from choline oxolinate than after the adcinistration of oxolinic acid, A high level of serun concentration was reached already in 0.5 hour first sampling and as an additional advantage, bioavailability is also significantly higher, Example 4 Examples for the formulations a Composition of tablets containing 100 300 mg of the active ingredient as calculated for 100 tablets Choline oxolinate 10.0 30.0 gLactose 2.0 gSaccharose 0.3 gPotato starch 5.2 9Mucilago for granulation q.s.Magnesium stearate 0.1 gTalc 0.2 9Potato starch q.s. to 50.0 9Composition of the granulating liquidWhite gelatine 5.0 iÓ Potato starch 5.0 Distilled water q.s. to 100.0 b Enteric coated dragée The dragée core consisting of the above components was covered with Eudragit L coating by using an appropriate process of dragée preparation. c Composition of sustained release tablets containing 300 mg of the active ingredient as calculated for 100 tablets .Choline oxolinate 30.00 9Carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt 4.50 gLactose 5.00 gGypsum 48.50 gStearic acid 5.00 g Distilled water q.s.Magnesium stearate 0.70 9Talc 1.40 9 d Composition of suppository for children containing 25 50 mg of the active ingredient as calculated for 100 supporitories .Choline oxolinate 2.5 5.0 9Tagat R 1 7.5 9Softisan 378 7.5 9Witepsol H 32 q.s. to 150.0 9 e Composition of suppository for adults containing 100 300 mg of the active ingredient as calculated for 100 supporitories .Choline oxolinate 10.0 30.0 gTagat R 1 15.0 9Softisan 378 15.0 9Witepsol H 32 q.s. to 300.0 9 Table I Calibrating series for establishing the correlation between the serum concentration and inhibition zone 2 parallels Concentration g ml 100 50 10 5 4 2 1Diameter of the inhibition 26.5 20.7 17.9 15.0 14.4 11.6 8.6 zone mm 24.7 19.4 17.2 14.7 14.1 11.9 8.5 Tabel II Diameters of the inhibition zones mm Sapling Animals treated with oxolinic acid Animale treated with choline oxolinate hour a b c a b c 0.5 17.7 0 18.2 22.6 22.6 21.9 1.0 17.7 18.2 17.5 19.3 19.1 20.9 2.0 15.3 17.4 8.8 18.2 17.8 17.8 3.0 14.0 16.0 14.3 13.9 15.3 11.4 4.0 16.8 14.7 14.1 11.7 11.7 14.3 Table IIIPlasma concentrations from the calibration curve g ml Time hour 0.5 1 2 3 4Animale treated with oxolinic 15.0 14.5 4.6 4.2 4.8 acidAnimale treated with choline 56.0 26.0 15.0 6.6 3.1 oxolinate
