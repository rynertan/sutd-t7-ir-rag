# Duplex pipette.

## Abstract
A duplex pipette comprises a housing, a pair of cylinders separately formed in the housing 10 to extend substantially in parallel to each other, first and second piston members 31, 32 each having a lower end portion 31B, 32B slidably received in one of the cylinders 21, 22 and a handle portion projecting outside the cylinder, and a pair of dropping tips 51, 52 mounted on the lower end of the housing by way of a connecting member, each of the dropping tips having a passage which communicates one of the cylinders with the outside of the housing. The connecting members 41, 42 are arranged so that the distance between the distal ends of the dropping tips can be changed. One of the piston members is arranged to be movable separately from the other piston member and the other piston member is arranged to be movable only together with said one piston member.
