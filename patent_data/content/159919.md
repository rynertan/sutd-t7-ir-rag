# AQUEOUS CONCENTRATED FABRIC SOFTENING COMPOSITION

## Abstract
An aqueous concentrated fabric softening composition comprises an aqueous base, more than 10 of a water insoluble cationic fabric softener and a least 4 of a nonion ic material which includes an alkylene oxide adduct of a fatty alcohol, acid, ester or amide with not more than 7 alkylene oxide groups per molecule. The total level of cationic and nonionic components is preferably less than 25 . The nonionic component improves processing by lowering the initial viscosity of the product.
