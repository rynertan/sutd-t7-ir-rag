# AUTOMATIC DISPENSER FOR FLEXIBLE DISCS

## Abstract
An automatic dispenser for dispensing a flexible rubber collar over a shouldered pin comprises a magazine 33 for lolding a stack of collars. A carrier 31 has a recess 45 provided with a shoulder 46 which resists movement of a disc but does not prevent movement of a disc through the carrier plate 31 on the application of sufficient axial force. An actuator constituted by a piston 14 is coupled to the carrier 31 to effect rotation thereof so as to align the disc held in the recess 42 with a hollow plunger 52. Advancement of the piston causes the hollow plunger 52 to force the disc through the aperture defined by the shoulder 46, the disc flexing under the action of the plunger. The plunger can receive the spigot or head of the pin so that the collar may be inserted on the spigot or pin as far as a shoulder thereon.
