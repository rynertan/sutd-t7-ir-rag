# Alkali metal aluminoborosilicate photochromic glasses.

## Abstract
Transparent photochromic glasses containing silver halide crystals sensitized with copper having base composi tions within the alkali metal aluminoborosilicate system have at least 0.025 As₂O₃ and or Sb₂O₃ is present in the composition to insure that more than 50 of the copper is present in the Cu state, Where an oxidizing agent is added to the composition, the amount of As₂O₃ and. or Sb₂O₃ will be increased to reduce the agent as well as to insure that more than 50 of the copper is present in the Cu state.
