Another object of this invention is to provide fine particles of II type cellulose having an average particle diameter of as small as not more than 20 micrometers and such a sharp particle size distribution that the proportion of particles having a particle diameter in the range of the average particle diameter 5 micrometers is at least 70 by weight based on the entire particles. A still further object of this invention is to provide fine particles of II type cellulose which have a sharp particle size distribution, and therefore, can be used in various fields either as such or as a mixture with other particles having different particle size distributions. Additional objects of this invention along with its advantages will become apparent from the following description. Firstly, these objects and advantages of this invention are achieved by providing fine cellulose particles having the following properties The fine cellulose particles of the invention are obtainable by a first process which comprises Step 1 includes one preferred embodiment in which viscose is mixed with the aqueous anionic polymeric compound and a cationic compound. The fine cellulose particles of the invention can also be prepared by a second process which comprises The first process for preparing the fine cellulose particles of this invention will now be described in detail. According to the first process, a dispersion of fine particles of viscose is formed in the first step fine particles of cellulose are formed in the second step and the fine particles of cellulose are separated from the mother liquor in the third step. The first step of forming the dispersion of fine particles of viscose is carried out by mixing viscose with a water soluble anionic polymeric compound. The viscose used, for example, has a gamma value of 30 to 100, preferably 35 to 90 a salt point of 3 to 20, preferably 4 to 18 a cellulose concentration of 3 to 15 by weight, preferably 5 to 13 by weight an alkali concentration of 2 to 15 by weight, preferably 4 to 13 by weight an alkali as sodium hydroxide weight proportion, based on cellulose, of 40 to 100 by weight, preferably 50 to 90 by weight and a viscosity at 20 C of 50 to 20,000 centipoises, preferably 80 to 18,000 centipoises. The pulp source of viscose is preferably linter pulp derived from either a coniferous tree or a broad leaved tree. The viscose as cellulose has an average degree of polymerization of usually 110 to 1,000. The water soluble anionic polymeric compound has a sulfonic acid group, a phosphonic acid group or a carboxyic acid group as an anionic group. These anionic groups may be in the form of a free acid group or a salt thereof. The sulfonic acid group may be derived from, for example, vinylsulfonic acid, styrenesulfonic acid, methylstyrenesulfonic acid, allylsulfonic acid, methallylsulfonic acid, acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid, or salts of these. The phosphonic acid group may be derived, for example, from styrenephosphonic acid, vinylphosphonic acid or salts of these. The carboxylic acid group may be derived from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, styrenecarboxylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid or salts of these acids. A water soluble anionic polymeric compound having the carboxylic acid group may, or example, be supplied as a homopolymer or copolymer containing sodium acrylate units by polymerizing sodium acrylate or a mixture of it with a copolymerizable monomer in a customary manner. Furthermore, by sulfonating a homopolymer of styrene, a water soluble anionic polymeric compound having a sulfonic acid group may be produced. The same can be said when the sulfonic acid group is derived from monomers other than styrenesulfonic acid, and when the phosphonic acid group and carboxylic acid group are derived from the aforesaid monomers. The water soluble anionic polymeric ccompound preferably contains at least 20 mole of units derived from such a monomer as described above which has the anionic group. Such a preferred polymeric compound includes both a homopolymer and a copolymer. The water soluble anionic polymeric compound has a number average molecular weight of preferably at least 5,000, more preferably 10,000 to 3,000,000. The water soluble anionic polymeric compound in this invention is not limited to the vinyl type polymers described above, and may include carboxymethyl cellulose, sulfoethyl cellulose, and salts e.g., Na salt of these. In one preferred embodiment of the first process, the first step of forming the dispersion of fine particles of viscose is carried out by mixing viscose with both the water soluble anionic polymeric compound and a cationic polymeric compound. According to this preferred embodiment, spherical, not elongated spherical, fine cellulose particles having a particle diameter of less than several tens of micrometers, especially less than several micrometers, can be produced very easily. These spherical particles can be produced easily even when the amount of the water soluble anionic polymeric compound is used in a smaller amount than in the case of using it alone or the stirring of the compounds during mixing with viscose is less intense. The cationic compound is, for example, a polymeric compound having an ammonium group as a cationic group, and preferably has water solubility. Polymeric compounds having quaternary ammonium salt groups as the anionic group are preferred. Examples of the cationic polymeric compound include ammonium salts represented by the followng formula I wherein R¹ and R² are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or a benzyl group, X¹ represents one equivalent of an anion, and n is a number showing the degree of polymerization, wherein R³ represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or a benzyl group, X² represents one equivalent of an anion, and m is a number showing the degree of polymerization, wherein R⁷, R⁸ and R⁹ are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or a benzyl group, X³ represents one equivalent of an anion, and ℓ is a number showing the degree of polymerization. In formula I above, R¹ and R² are identical or different and each represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or a benzyl group. The lower alkyl group may be linear or branched, and includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, sec butyl, iso butyl, t butyl and n pentyl. Methyl and ethyl are preferred as the lower alkyl group. X¹ is one equivalent of an anion such as a chlorine ion, a bromine ion, or a hemisulfate ion. The number In formula II , specific examples of the lower alkyl represented by R⁴, R⁵ and R⁶ and one equivalent of an anion represented by X² are the same as those given for the lower alkyl group and one equivalent of an anion in formula I . In formula II , m is a number representing the degree of polymerization and is, for example, 3 to 1,000, preferably 5 to 800. Examples of the cationic polymer compound including the ammonium salts of formulae I , II and III include poly N,N dimethyl 3,5 methylenepiperizium chloride , poly N,N diethyl 3,5 methylenepiperizium chloride , polyvinylbenzyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, polyvinylbenzyltriethyl ammonium chloride, polymethacryloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride and polymethacryloxyethyltriethyl ammonium chloride. The cationic polymeric compounds have a number average molecular weight of, for example, 500 to 150,000, preferably 1,000 to 100,000, more preferably 3,000 to 70,000. In a preferred method , the dispersion can be formed in step 1 by, for example, simultaneously mixing viscose, the water soluble anionic polymeric compound and the cationic polymeric compound, or by first mixing viscose with the water soluble anionic polymeric compound and then mixing the resulting mixture with the cationic polymeric compound. The water soluble anionic polymer compound is used preferably as an aqueous solution, more preferably as an aqueous solution in which the concentration of the polymeric compound is 0.5 to 25 by weight, especially 2 to 22 by weight. When viscose is first mixed with the cationic polymeric compound and then with the water soluble anionic polymeric compound, viscose is liable to coagulate, and therefore, the mixing operation should be carried out with utmost care. The amount of the water soluble anionic polymeric compound to be mixed is 0.3 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 45 parts by weight, especially preferably 4 to 20 parts by weight, per part by weight of cellulose. When the cationic polymeric compound is used together, its amount is preferably 0.0005 to 0.4 part by weight, more preferably 0.001 to 0.3 part by weight, especially preferably 0.003 to 0.2 part by weight, per part by weight of the water soluble anionic polymeric compound. Mixing in step 1 may be effected by any means which can lead to the formation of the dispersion of fine viscose particles. For example, it can be carried out by mechanical stirring with stirring vanes or buffles, ultrasonic stirring, or mixing with a static mixer, either singly or in combination. Advantageously, the mixing is carried out at a temperature lower than the boiling point of carbon dioxide contained in the viscose, preferably at 0 to 40 C. The dispersion of fine viscose particles formed in the first step is then coagulated and neutralized in the second step to form fine particles of cellulose. Coagulation and neutralization may be carried out simultaneously or at different times. When coagulation and neutralization are to be carried out at different times, the coagulation may be effected by heating the dispersion or mixing the dispersion with a coagulating agent. The neutralization can be effected by subsequently contacting the coagulated product with an acid. Desirably, the coagulation reaction is carried out while the resulting dispersion is being mixed. The mixing operation may be carried out by any means, and for example, as in the step of forming the dispersion of fine particles, it may be carried out by using stirring vanes. In a method in which the cationic polymeric compound is used, true spherical particles having an average particle diameter of not more than 20 micrometers can be easily obtained by performing the first and second steps under relatively mild shearing conditions, for example by using stirring vanes at a peripheral speed of not more than 200 m min. and a rotating speed of not more than 1,000 rpm. This is one great advantage of the preferred embodiment in view of the fact that for example, the peripheral speed and rotating speed of the stirring vanes must be made larger than when fine particles are to be formed without using the cationic polymeric compound. The preferred embodiment also has the advantage that under low shear, the deformation of particles, for example the occurrence of elongated spherical particles, under high shear can be inhibited. Coagulation by heating can be advantageously carried out at a temperature above the boiling point of carbon disulfide contained in viscose, for example at 50 to 90 C. Coagulation with a coagulating agent needs not to be carried out at such an elevated temperatures, and temperatures of 0 to 40 C usually suffice. Examples of the coagulating agent are lower aliphatic alcohols, alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts of inorganic acids, inorganic acids, and organic acids, and mixtures of these with each other or with water soluble polymeric compounds such as polyethylene glycol or its derivatives. The lower aliphatic alcohols may be linear or branched and are preferably aliphatic alcohols having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n propanol and n butanol. Examples of the inorganic acids are hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and carbonic acid. The alkali metal salts of inorganic acids are preferably sodium salts such as NaCl and Na₂SO₄ and potassium salts such as K₂SO₄. The alkaline earth metal salts of inorganic acids are preferably magnesium salts such as MgSO₄ and calcium sals such as CaCl₂. The organic acids are preferably carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, benzoic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, maleic anhydride, malic acid and oxalic acid. The coagulating agent is used in a proportion of about 20 to 300 by weight bsed on cellulose in the viscose. The acid used as a neutralizing agent preferably includes, for example, an inorganic strong acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. The neutralizing agent is used in an amount sufficient to neutralize viscose, and fine particles of cellulose can be formed. As stated above, the coagulation and neutralization in the second step may be carried out simultaneously. An acid, preferably an inorganic strong acid such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, is an effective agent for the coagulation and neutralization. The acid used in an amount sufficient to neutralize viscose is sufficient for the coagulation and neutralization process. The simultaneous coagulation and neutralization are carried out advantageously at a temperature of, for example, 0 to 40 C. According to the first process, the fine particles of cellulose formed in the second step are then separated in the third step from the mother liquor, and as required, subjected to removal of sulfur, washing with an acid, washing with water or drying. If desired, bleaching may be carried out after acid washing. The separation of the fine particles from the mother liquor can be carried out, for example, by filtration or centrifugal separation. The removal of sulfur may be carried out by using an aqueous solution of an alkali such as sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. As required, the remaining alkali may be removed by washing with an acid such as dilute hydrochloric acid, and the product is washed with water and dried. Now, the second process for preparing the fine cellulose particles of this invention will be described below in detail. According to the second process, a dispersion of fine particles of viscose is formed in the first step fine particles of cellulose are formed in the second step and the fine cellulose particles are separated from the mother liquor. The general procedure of the second process, therefore, is not different from the first process. The first step of forming the dispersion of fine particles of viscose is carried out by mixing viscose with a water soluble polyethylene glycol or its derivative having a number average molecular weight of at least 1,500. The viscose used may be the same as that described in the description of the first process. The polyethylene glycol or its derivative has a number average molecular weight of at least 1,500, preferably 1,500 to 400,000. Examples of suitable polyethylene glycol derivatives include water soluble compounds obtained by blocking only the hydroxyl group at one end of polyethylene glycol with an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a phenyl group substituted by an alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, or an acyl group having 2 to 18 carbon atoms, and A B A type block copolymers in which A and A are identical or different and represent a polyethylene oxide block, and B represents a polypropylene oxide block . Specific examples include polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether, polyethylene glycol monolauryl ether, polyethylene glycol monocetyl ether, polyethylene glycol monomethylphenyl ether, polyethylene glycol monononylphenyl ether, polyethylene glycol monoacetate, polyethylene glycol monolaurate, and polyoxyethylene block polyoxypropylene block polyoxyethylene block copolymer. Polyethylene glycol is preferred among the polyethylene glycol and its derivatives. Polyethylene glycol has a number average molecular weight of preferably 6,000 to 200,000, more preferably 8,000 to 100,000, especially preferably 10,000 to 30,000. The polyethylene glycol derivative preferably has a number average molecular weight of 1,500 to 16,000. According to the second process, viscose is first mixed with the water soluble polyethylene glycol or its derivative by any means which can lead to the formation of a dispersion of fine particles of viscose. Specific means are the same as those described above with regard to the first process. The water soluble high molecular weight polyethylene glycol or its derivative is used preferably as an aqueous solution, more preferably as an aqueous solution in which the concentration of polyethyene glycol or its derivative is 0.5 to 60 by weight, especially 5 to 55 by weight, above all 10 to 40 by weight. The polyethylene glycol or its derivative is used in an amount of 1 to 30 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 28 parts by weight, especially preferably 4 to 24 parts by weight, above all 8 to 16 parts by weight, per part by weight of cellulose. The temperature at which viscose is mixed with the polyethylene glycol or its derivative is not particularly restricted. Desirably, the mixing is carried out at a temperature lower than the temperature at which the dispersion of fine particles of viscose is formed. The dispersion of fine particles of viscose is formed at a temperature of at least 55 C. At temperatures lower than 55 C, it is impossible to obtain the dispersion of fine particles of viscose which is a basis for giving fine particles of cellulose. According to the second process, the dispersion of fine particles of viscose is then coagulated and neutralized in the second step to form fine particles of cellulose. The coagulation and neutralization may be carried out simultaneously or at different times. When coagulation and neutralization are to be carried out at different times, the coagulation may be effected by heating the dispersion or mixing the dispersion with a coagulating agent. The neutralization can be effected by subsequently contacting the coagulated product with an acid. Desirably, the coagulation reaction is carried out while the resulting dispersion is being mixed. The coagulation reaction is carried out at a temperature equal to, or higher than, the temperature at which the dispersion is formed. Coagulation by heating or by using a coagulating agent is preferably carried out at a temperature of 60 to 90 C. The coagulating agent and its amount are the same as described above with regard to the first process. The use of a combination of the coagulating agent and polyethylene glycol or its derivative in coagulation brings about the advantage that the decrease in the concentration of polyethylene glycol or its derivative in the dispersion by the addition of the coagulating agent can be prevented and the dispersion can be coagulated stably. The acid used as a neutralizing agent is preferably an inorganic strong acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. The neutralizing agent is used in an amount sufficient to neutralize viscose, and fine particles of cellulose are formed. As stated above, the coagulation and neutralization in the second step may be carried out simultaneously. An inorganic strong acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is preferably an effective agent for coagulation and neutralization. The acid used in an amount sufficient to neutralize viscose is also sufficient for coagulation and neutralization. Advantageously, the simultaneous coagulation and neutralization are carried out at a temperature of 60 to 90 C. According to the second process, the fine particles of cellulose formed in the second step are then treated in the third step under the same conditions as described above with regard to the first process. As a result, the present invention can very easily give fine cellulose particles composed substantially of II type cellulose. The fine cellulose particles having a relatively sharp particle size distribution are an aggregate of particles having an average particle diameter of, for example, about 1 to 20 micrometers. The fine cellulose particles of this invention are characterized by having the above requirements a to d . These requirements will be described below. The fine cellulose particles of this invention are composed substantially of II type cellulose, i.e. regenerated cellulose. Accordingly, fine cellulose particles composed of natural cellulose, i.e. I type cellulose, completely differ from the fine particles of this invention. As is well known, II type cellulose and I type cellulose are distinguished from each other by X ray diffractometery. The X ray diffraction pattern of II type cellulose does not substantially have a diffraction peak at a diffraction angle 2ϑ 15 which exists clearly in I type cellulose. The fine cellulose particles of the invention is characterized by having a crystallinity, determined by X ray diffractometry, of 5 to 35 , preferably 10 to 28 , especially preferably 15 to 26 . The fine cellulose particles of the invention are not amorphous, but crystalline as specified by the above crystallinity. The fine cellulose particles of the invention are composed substantially of spherical or elongated spherical particles having an average particle diameter of not more than 20 micrometers. The fine cellulose particles of the invention are preferably composed substantially of spherical to elongated spherical particles having an average particle diameter of 1 to 18 micrometers, more preferably 1.5 to 15 micrometer. The elongated spherical as used in this application is a generic concept embracing such a shape as an ellipse, a long stretched circle, a peanut like shape or an oval shape in the projection chart or top plan view of a particle. The fine particles of cellulose in this invention are spherical or elongated spherical, and therefore differ from angled or irregularly shaped particles. The elongated spherical particles of cellulose are liable to form if the dispersion formed in the first step is coagulated in the second step while viscose and the water soluble anionic polymeric compound are being mixed too vigorously. The fine cellulose particles of this invention have a very sharp particle size distribution such that the proportion of particles having a particle diameter in the range of the average particle diameter 5 micrometers is at least 70 by weight based on the entire particles. For example, when the entire particles have an average particle diameter of 10 micrometers, the proportion of particles having a particle diameter in the range of 5 to 15 micrometers is at least 70 by weight based on the entire particles. When the average particle diameter is 3 micrometers, the above range of the average particle diameter 5 micrometers should be understood to be more than 0 but not more than 8 micrometers since the lower limit is never 0 or below. The proportion of particles having an average particle diameter 5 micrometers in the fine cellulose particles is at least 75 by weight in the case of a sharper size distribution, at least 80 by weight in the case of a much sharper size distribution, at least 85 by weight in the case of a still sharper size distribution, and at least 90 by weight in the case of an especially sharp size distribution, based on the entire particles. In fine cellulose particles of this invention which have an average particle diameter of at least 5 micrometers, the proportion of particles having a particle size in the range of the average particle diameter micrometrs average particle micrometers is preferably at least 70 by weight of the entire particles. Secondarily, the fine particles of cellulose of this invention are characterized by the following properties. Cellulose constituting the fine cellulose particles of the invention mostly shows a degree of polymerization in the range of 100 to 700, and a copper value, measured and defined by the following method, of not more than 3. Many of the fine cellulose particles of the invention have a degree of water swelling, measured and defined by the following method, of 100 to 500 . In some of these fine cellulose particles, the volume of pores having a pore diameter, measured by the mercury porosimeter method, of 0.01 to 0.5 micrometer is not more than 60 x 10 ³ cc g. As stated above, the fine cellulose particles of this invention are fine and have a sharp particle size distribution, are relatively stable to chemicals and free from toxicity. Hence, they can be used in wide industrial fields as diluents for medicines, extenders for cosmetics, or as food additives. Of course, the fine cellulose particles of this invention can be used as an aggregate of fine particles having the above characteristics a to d . As required, groups of fine cellulose particles of the invention which differ from each other in average particle diameter and or particle size distribution may be prepared, and used as a mixture. The following examples illustrate the present invention in greater detail. The various properties of the viscose and cellulose particles in the present invention are measured by the following methods. Determined by X ray diffractometry described in Textile Academy Journal, Vol. 19, No. 2 1963 , pp. 113 119. An X ray diffraction curve from 2ϑ 5 to 2ϑ 45 is taken, and the crystallinity is calculated in accordance with the following equation.

The pore diameter is calculated in accordance with the following equation. where D is the pore diameter in micrometers, and P is the pressure in Psia. The pore volume at this pore diameter is calculated by using the density of mercury 13.5585 g cm³ at 15oC . where About 1.0 g of fine cellulose particles are immersed in 20 times their amount of pure water and filtered spontaneously on a glass filter composed of a glass filter and a cellulose acetate film having a hole diameter of 0.2 micrometer placed in intimate contact with the glass fiber, followed by centrifugal dehydration in accordance with the method of measuring the degree of water swelling in JIS L 1015. The swollen cellulose particles are weighed c . While the fine cellulose particles are placed on the glass filter their absolutely dried weight d is determined in accordance with the method of measuring the degree of water swelling in JIS L 1015. The degree of water swelling is calculated in accordance with the following equation. Measured in accordance with the method described in JIS L 1015. Measured in accordance with the method described in JIS P 1801 1961. About 2.5 g of viscose is dissolved in 70 ml of pure water, and pure water is further added to adjust the total amount of the solution to 100 ml.
