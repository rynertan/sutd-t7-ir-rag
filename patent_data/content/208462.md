## Description
MEANS FOR PROTECTING FISH The present invention relates to means for protecting fish and relates particularly, but not exclusively, to means for protecting fish from birds such as herons. Presently, a serious problem for the owners of ornamental fish ponds is that herons feed on the fish especially during the winter months. Herons often wade in from the waters edge and one known precaution is to set up trip wires around and or across a pond. This precaution has been found to be inadequate as the herons can land instead inside the trip wires. Another known precaution is to cover the pond with a net which is fastened down around the edge of the pond. The net may prevent herons from taking fish from the pond but spoils the appearance of the pond and also interferes with plants or other structures projecting above the water level. Marauding birds are also a problem for fish farmers who lose stock to wading. birds and to birds which swoop down to steal fish. According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a net for protecting fish in water, characterised in that the net is adapted to float on or near the water surface and comprises a plurality of releasably inter connectable modules. A net according to the present invention has the advantage that it floats so that there is no need to fasten down the net around the edge of the pond or other area of water in question or to provide separate buoyancy means for keeping the net afloat. The size of the net can be adapted to suit requirements, for example, to suit the shape of a particular pond. It is envisaged that placing a floating net only around the periphery of the water surface may be all that is needed to keep away wading birds. Therefore, especially where large expanses of water are involved, such as reservoirs, lakes etc. it mat not be necessary completely to cover the water surface in order to protect the fish. A net according to the present invention provides effective means for protecting fish from marauding birds in such a way as not to spoil the appearance of the area of water. The appearance of the net, in particular the colour, can be chosen according to the environmental conditions in which it is to be used. Moreover, depending on the size of the apertures in the net, fish can conveniently be fed through the net. Also, the net can be made so as not to prevent light penetrating the water to a great extent. An important advantage of a modular net according to the present invention is that it can be assembled to suit the shape of a particular stretch of water, such as a pond, and can be arranged around existing plants and other structures. Furthermore, the net in modular form is very versatile in that its overall shape can be modified periodically to suit requirements. Each module may comprise a generally planar frame.The frames may be polygonal and may, for example, by octagonal. The net may comprise separate clips for releasably interconnecting neighbouring modules. Conveniently, the clips may be configured as a push fit into apertures in the modules for interconnecting two neighbouring modules. One or more of the modules may comprise integral fastening means for interconnection with an adjacent module. It is envisaged that the net may be adapted for receiving, or may be provided with, an infill, which may be a mesh infill. Furthermore, the net may be provided with means for supporting a floating container eg. a fish food container. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of protecting fish in water from marauding birds comprising floating a net on or near the water surface so that the net floats freely. The method may comprise floating a net on or neat only the perimeter of the water surface. It should be understood that the size of the apertures in a net according to the present invention may be chosen according to requirements. In determining the size of the apertures, regard may be had to the size of the fish to be protected and or to the particular type of bird which is likely to take the fish, for example, the size of the feet and or the beak of the bird. Also, the method by which a particular bird is likely to attempt to steal fish would be borne in mind. The size of the net apertures may range from those present in a fine mesh to a diameter of approximately one foot 0.305 metres or more. Net apertures of approximately eight inches 0.203 metres have found to be effective in deterring herons from stealing fish and it is thought that a diameter range of eight inches 0.203 metres to fifteen inches 0.38 metres would be feasible for this purpose. In cases where the net comprises apertures adapted to receive an infill or a floating article, the net apertures may be of any required size and may be larger than those mentioned above. A particular embodiment of the present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying schemetic drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of part of a modular net according to the present invention Figure 2 is a plan view of a module of the net of figure 1 Figure 3 is a perspective view of a first form of clip for attaching adjacent modules together positioned above and, Figure LI is a perspective view of a second form of clip. Referring to figures 1 3, a modular net is indicated generally at 10 and comprises a plurality of octagonal modules 12. Each of the modules 12 comprises a planar polypropylene frame which is channel shaped in cross section and which will float on water and which is generally rigid. Polypropylene material resists corrosion and is impervious to weather conditions. Alternate sides of each module 12 are formed with apertures 14 which enable adjacent modules 12 to be attached together using a clip 16, as shown in figure 3. The clip 16 is made of plastics material and comprises a plate 18 from which depend two similar bulbous protrusions 20 and 22. The protrusions 20 and 22 are a push fit in the apertures 14 of the modules 12 so as releasably to interconnect adjacent the modules. Figure 4 shows an alternative form of clip 24 which is resilient and made from nylon, comprising a bridging portion 26 and two resilient legs 28 and 30 depending therefrom. To interconnect two adjacent modules 12 the legs 28 and 30 of the clip 24 are flexed outwardly to that the clip 24 can be passed downwardly over the adjacent sides of two of the modules 12. The legs 28 and 30 are then released so that they spring back to their normal position to hold the modules 12 together. It is also envisaged that the modules may be made from frames formed from tubular plastics material filled with polystyrene. In use, the modular net 10 is assembled by fastening the modules 12 together using the clips 16 or 24. The modules 12 can be clipped together to form a tessellation of any desired overall configuration to suit the shape of a particular pond and to accommodate plants and other existing structures in the pond.Depending on the size of the pond, the net 10 may be assembled on land and then placed in the pond or may be built up gradually on the pond. In use, when floating on water, the clips 24 act as hinges to allow the net to bend to accomodate water movement. The size of the modules 12 may vary and is chosen according to requirements. In the embodiments shown, the overall width of each of the modules 12 is approximately one foot 0.305 metres . The thickness of the walls of each module is approximately Fn 0.635cm . In practice, the modules 12 may be adapted to receive, or may be provided with, an infill to provide greater protection. The infill may take the form of integral cross bars on the module so as to divide the module into four areas. Alternatively, the infill may take the form of a finer lattice or a mesh which is either integral with, or is attached to, the module. It is envisaged that the modules may be provided with hooks or other fastening means to which a separate mesh infill may be attached. One or more of the modules may comprise means for supporting other floating articles, for example, plant pots, fish food pots etc. For this purpose, some of the modules 12 may be provided with downwardly extending support hooks on which floating pots can rest.Alternatively, the floating pots may simply be shaped so as to nest within one of the modules 12. When it is desired to remove the net 10 from the pond, the net is simply lifted out and disassembled by disengaging the clips 16 and or 24 so as to disconnect the modules 12 which can then be wiped clean and stored until needed again. The net Just described is a very open structure in which the material of the net takes up only a small percentage of the overall surface area of the net.Consequently, the net has only a small effect on the amount of light and air reaching the water. The proportion of the total surface area of the net occupied by the material of the net may be between 5 and 20 and is preferably less than 10 . It should be understood that the modules for forming a modular net according to the present invention may take various forms and, for example, may not all be identical. It is envisaged that one or more of the modules may be formed from a frame defining several polygons. For example, in a modified form, the modular net may comprise unitary modules equivalent to four of the modules 12 described above joined together. The modules may each simply be cruciform shapes of plastic each provided with means for connection to a neighbouring cruciform module. For example, each cruciform module may be privided at its extremities with two eyelets and two hooks for inter engaging other modules to form a square lattice. It is envisaged that the net, or parts of it, may be electrically heatable to prevent or limit the formation of ice. For example, selected modules of the net may contain a resistance wire and be connected to a source of electrical power by a conduit led across the top of the net. The net may comprise a unitary lattice. According to this feature, the net may be formed from plastics material produced by fretting, stamping or other suitable method and cut to the required size before use. In another embodiment, not illustrated, a net according to the present invention is a unitary lattice of polypropylene produced by fretting, stamping or other suitable method. Before use, the net is cut to the size required. It is envisaged that the unitary net may be available, in various widths, on a yardage basis off roll stock. As discussed above in connection with the modular form of net, the net apertures in the unitary version may also be provided with, or adapted to receive, an infill such as a mesh infill and may be adapted to receive other floating objects such as fishfood pots. The material used for the net is preferably plastics but may be of any kind which adapted to float on water and which can withstand the environmental conditions in which the net is to be used. Composite materials are envisaged. Preferably, the net is made from a material of a desity such that it will float on or near the surface of water. It should be understood that a net according to the present invention is suitable for use on areas of water of any size. For example, the applications may range from domestic use on ornamental ponds to industrial use by fish farmers and the like on lakes and reservoirs.
