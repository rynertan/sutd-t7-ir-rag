# Process and furnace for burning solid fuel.

## Abstract
Solid fuel such as coal is fed into an inlet shaft 4 of the furnace through a rotary feeder 5 constructed to prevent the admission of air. Primary air channels 18 supply the major part of the air required for combustion of the fuel in a region in which the fuel bed is sufficiently thick to avoid disturbance and the formation of holes by this air. Further, narrower air channels 19 supply sufficient, diffused and low velocity air to complete the combustion of the fuel without substantial entrainment of grit and ash. Air is prevented from flowing in contact with the fuel upstream of the channels 18 and the metering edge 75.
