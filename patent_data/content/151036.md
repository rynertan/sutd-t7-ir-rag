# N.M.R. shims.

## Abstract
A magnetic shim 18 for an N.M.R. apparatus 1 com prises a deformable body particularly a flexible sheet of electrically insulating material e.g. P.V.C. within which magnetic material e.g. Î³ ferric oxide or barium ferrite is dispersed. The shim may easily be attached e.g. by an ad hesive backing layer to an inside wall of the apparatus 1 and may easily be cut to size with scissors. The nature of the compensation effected by the shim may be altered by em ploying different magnetic materials dispersed within the non conducting material and or by varying their concentra tion.
