## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an analyzer in general and, more particularly, to a petroleum stream analyzer utilizing radiation techniques. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A petroleum stream analyzer includes a test cell having a petroleum stream, or portion thereof, flowing through it. A neutron source bombards the petroleum stream in the test cell with fast neutrons which are slowed down and thereafter engaged in thermal neutron capture reaction with materials in the petroleum stream. A gamma ray device provides a gamma ray energy spectrum of the material in response to the capture of the thermal neutrons by the material in the petroleum stream. The gamma ray device is shielded by shielding material.A housing houses the neutron source and shielding material and the gamma ray device and is located in the test cell in a manner so that a longitudinal axis of the housing passes through the neutron source, the shielding material, and the gamma ray device and is substantially aligned with the axial flow of the petroleum stream in the test cell.Apparatus derives a measure of a characteristic of the petroleum stream in accordance with the obtained gamma ray energy spectra of the materials in the petroleum stream. The objects and advantages of the invention will appear more fully hereinafter from a continuation of the detailed description which follows, taken together with the accompanying drawings wherein true embodiments of the invention are illustrated by way of example. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for illustration purposes only and are not to be construed as defining the limits of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1. is a simplified block diagram of a petroleum stream analyzer constructed in accordance with the present invention. Figure 2. is a detailed drawing of the test chamber shown in Figure 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Relatively small concentrations of salt in crude oil can often cause major problems in the crude oil refining process. The present invention relates to the detection in a flowing crude oil stream or other petroleum conduit of concentrations of salt. The present invention is based upon the bombardment or irradiation of a flowing stream of crude oil with neutrons and the detection of gamma radiation admitted by the element chlorine upon capture of thermal neutrons. For a given thermal neutron flux, the yield of chlorine capture radiation is proportional to the concentration of chlorine in the flowing stream of crude oil. If it is known or assumed that all chlorine is in the form of NaCl, or other chloride form, then the intensity of chlorine captured radiation is a direct indication of salt concentration. Gamma radiation resulting from thermal capture reactions is prompt in the sense that it is admitted within microseconds after the capture event. This is in contrast to 4,delayed gamma radiation resulting from activation type reactions which is admitted from milliseconds to years after the reaction. Since thermal neutron capture radiation is almost instantaneous, the velocity and volume flow rate of the crude oil stream do not effect the measurement. A salt in crude monitor such as disclosed and described in U. S. Patent Nos.4,209,695 and 4,200,789 involve the use of the foregoing radiation techniques in determining the salt content in a production stream of crude oil. The present invention is an improvement of the inventions of those patents by utilizing an in line test tapping chamber. Referring now to Figure 1 a production stream of crude oil flows through a pipe line 8 which is connected to a test chamber 5 and out again through another pipe line 8.Test chamber 5 has within it a neutron source 9 and a gamma ray detector assembly 10. Neutron source 9 irradiates the production stream with neutrons. Gamma ray detector assembly 10 provides pulses corresponding in height and frequency to the detected gamma radiation. Detector assembly 10 periodically provides reference pulses. The pulses from detector assembly 10 are provided to an amplifier 12. It should be noted that the wires connecting detector assembly 10 to amplifier 12 are not shown inFigure 2 so that the details of construction of test chamber 5 can best be shown. The output is amplified and provided to a gain stabilizer 14 which in turn provides the stablized signal to a multi channel analyzer 18. Multichannel analyzer 18 provides a plurality of signals corresponding to the test counts of various levels of energy.The signals from the multi channel analyzer 18 are provided to a computer 24 which provides its output to a recorder 30. The details of operation of amplifier 12, gain stabilizer 14, multi channel analyzer 18, computer 24 and recorder 30 are fully described in the foregoing patents and are not necessary to an understanding of the present invention. A B power supply 33 and a high voltage power supply 38 provide the necessary operating voltages to neutron source 9 and gamma ray detector assembly 10. With reference to Figure 2, test chamber 5 includes an end cap 50 affixed to an adaptor 53 which is welded to a T fitting 56. Another adaptor 57 is also welded to T fitting 56 and the remaining opening of T fitting 56 is welded to a bell reducer 60. A length of iron pipe 64, adapted as hereinafter explained, is welded to bell reducer 60 and to another bell reducer 66. Bell reducer 66 is in turn welded to a T fitting 67 having an adaptor 69 welded to it for connection to pipe line 8.Another adapter 71 is also welded to T fitting 67 for connection to an end plate 73. Pipe 64 has mounted on its internal side, boron carbide B4C layer 77 which in turn has an epoxy glass lining 79 coated thereon on it. Due to boron s large thermal neutron capture crosssection, the boron carbide layer effectively shields iron pipe 64 from neutrons thermalized slowed down within the petroleum stream. Thermal neutron capture gamma ray energies from boron are less than about .514ev whereas those from iron extend into the high energy region where the thermal capture gamma rays from chlorine and sulfur are measured. Therefore, without the shielding action of the boron carbide layer the gamma rays from the iron pipe would contribute a substantial background noise to the energy levels at which the monitor of the aforementioned U. S. patents monitors the chlorine and sulfur gamma rays.This background noise would interfere with the accurate determination of chlorine and sulfur within the petroleum stream and essentially would prevent their determination of low levels of chlorine and sulfur altogether. End plate 73 has affixed to it an epoxy glass sleeve 80 with an internal boron carbide sleeve 83. If more rigidity is desired, a steel sleeve may be inserted inside of boron carbide sleeve 83. Mounted within the passageway is a neutron source 9, shielding material 95 and a gamma ray detector assembly 10. Shielding material 95 is made from machineable hard plastic coated with boron carbide on its surfaces. Neutron source 9 and detector assembly 10 are maintained in apredetermined position within boron carbide sleeve 83 by shielding material 101 and 102. AgainShielding material 101 and 102 are made from machineable hard plastic coated with boron carbide on its surfaces. The electrical connections for neutron source 9 and the gamma ray detector assembly 10 are not shown for convenience. In operation, with the petroleum stream flowing through it, neutron source 9 is activated and bombards the petroleum stream which yields gamma radiation as herinbefore explained. Gamma ray detector assembly 10 detects the gamma radiation and provides an output signal in accordance with detected gamma rays for the analysis of the salt content of the production stream as set forth in the aforementioned U. S. patents. The test chambers disclosed in the foregoing U.S.patents use the fluid to be measured as a shield between detector and source. As the hydrogen index of the fluid decreases, e.g. increasing gas content, the fluid loses its neutron moderating and gamma ray shielding characteristics.This loss of shielding allows neutrons with source energies and or near source energies and gamma rays from the source to reach the detector and contribute to undesirable background effects. The present invention uses shielding material to prevent direct transmission of above neutrons and gamma rays to the detector. The present invention allows easy change of spacing between neutron source 9 and gamma ray detector assembly 10 to optimize measurement of fluids with various neutron moderating hydrogen index characteristics. The spacing is controlled or changed by changing the length of shielding material 95 between source 9 and assembly 10 whereas in the aforementioned U. S. Patents, the distance is fixed. Further, at the very least, a change in the size of the test chamber would be required to change the spacing. The aforementioned U. S. Patents use the petroleum stream itself as the shielding material. The present invention improves upon this by using special shielding material which can be exchanged to optimize the response for various crudes and parameters to be measured. It should also be noted that the present invention allows the simultaneous use of more than one detector spaced at different distances from the source.The responses of the detectors can then be combined to obtain fluid characteristics such as hydrogen index or gas content by ratio methods.
