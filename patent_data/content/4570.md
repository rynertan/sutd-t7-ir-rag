## Description
Novel thiol esters and process for preparing cephalosporin compounds using the same This invention relates to novel thiol esters having utility as a sleep induciiig agent, an antibacterial agent and an acylating agent for amines and hydrazines, particularly as active esters for preparing cephalosporin compounds, a process for their preparation and a process for the preparation of cephalosporin compounds using the thiol esters. A l,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thiol ester of the formula,EMI1.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and a process for its preparation have not been reported yet. Further, no method is yet known for preparing a cephalosporin compound of the formula,EMI2.1 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, in one step using 7 aminocephalosporanic acid or its derivative as the starting material. In order to obtain the above described cephalosporin compound, it.is necessary to employ the methods as described in U.S.Patent Nos. 3,278,531 and 3,516,997, Japanese PatentPublication Nos. 5150 1971 and 35751 1971 as a combination. For example, the above described cephalosporin compound may be prepared by two steps, i.e., either by firstly reacting 7 aminocephalosporanic acid with lH tetrazole l acetic acid and secondly reacting the 7 lH tetrazol l ylacetamido cephalosporanic acid thus obtained with a 113,4 thiadiazole S thiol or by firstly reacting 7 aminocephalosporanic acid with a l,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thiol and secondly reacting the 7 amino 3 1,3, 4 thiadiazol 5 yl thiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid thus obtained with lH tetrazole l acetic acid.Thus, these methods require a two step operation, and further a separation procedure such as an extraction with a solvent for recovering the unstable product formed in the first step and, as a result, the yield is too low for practical purposes. Accordingly, the present invention in one embodiment provides a. I,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thiol ester of the formula,EMI2.2 wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group. The present invention in another embodiment provides a process for preparing the above described compound of Formula I . In a further embodiment, the invention provides a process for preparing a cephalosporin compound of the formula,EMI3.1 wherein R is the same as defined above, which comprises reacting 7 aminocephalosporanic acid or its derivative with the above described compound ofFormula I . The 1,3,4 thiadiazole 5 thioi esters ofFormula I of this invention are lH tetrazole l acetic acid 1,3,4 thiadiazol 5fy1thiol ester and 1H tetrazole lacetic acid 2 methyl l 3 4 thiadiazol 5Nylthiol ester. These compounds of Formula I of this invention are novel compounds and useful as sleepinducing agents and anti bacterial agents of high value. More specifically, the compounds of Formula I of this invention have been found to exhibit an anesthetic effect, i.e., a sleep inducing effect according to the following experiment. Male ddY strai,l mice aged 7 or 6 weeks, each group consisting of 8 animals, were givell an intravenous injection of 35 mg kg of sodium thiopental in an amount corresponding to a certain anesthetic period of time, the period of loss of the righting wrighting reflexbeing measured as the anesthetic effect. As a test drug, lH tetrazole l acetic acid 2 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 5ylthiol ester was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and the test drug thus prepared was orally administered to the animals at a rate of 0.05 mi lO g weight one hour before the administration of sodium thiopental. The results are shown in the Table below. Table Amount of Period of Administra Time of tion Anesthesia p.o. Average Value Compound mg kg minutes lH Tetrazole l acetic acid 2 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 5 ylthiol ester 400 33.8 ditto 200 21.0 ditto 100 10.3Comparative Group 0 8.4 As is clearly to be seen from the Table as described above, the period of time of anesthesia of lH tetrazole l acetic acid 2 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 5 ylthiol ester used in an amount of 400 mg kg is 4,02 times greater than that of the comparative group. Thus, the prolongation effect on the period of time of anesthesia according to the compounds of Formula I of this invention is remarkable. Also, lH tetrazole l acetic acid 2 methyl1,3,4 thiadiazol 5 ylthiol ester of this invention had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 50 fg mg toCorynebacterium dip1Ieriae P.W.8and therefore possesses an antibacterial activity.

Aa a result, 2.1 g of 7 u1 tetrazol 1 ylacetamido 3 1,3, 4 thiadiazol 5 ylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid having a purity of 93.1 were obtained at a yield of 88.9 . 1 g of this compound was recrystallized from a 50 acetone aqueous solution to give 0.55 g of a purified crystal having a melting point Of 155 C decomp. and a purity of 98.5 .Ultraviolet Absorption Spectrum 3 sodium hydrogencarbon . ate aqueous solution lambda max 273 nm max Example 8 A solution of 1.2 g of lH tetrazole l acetic acid 2 methyl 1,3,4 thiadiazol 5 ylthiol ester, 5 ml of N,N dimethylformamide and 5 ml of water was added to a solution of 1.4 g of 7 aminocephalosporanic acid, 30 ml of N,N dimethylformamide and 30 ml of water with stirring and the mixed solution thus obtained was further stirred at 60 C for 4 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere. After completion of the reaction the N1N dimethylformamide and water were distilled from the reaction solution and 50 ml of water and 100 ml of ethyl acetate were added to the residue. The pH of the solution thus obtained was adjusted to 3 with 3N hydrochloric acid and then the solution was extracted with ethyl acetate and further twice with 100 ml of ethyl acetate.The extract was dried over sodium sulfate and the ethyl acetate was distilled to give 2.16 g of 7 1H tetrazol l ylacetamido 3 2 methyl l, 3, 4 thiadiazol 5 ylthiomethyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid having a purity of 92.5 at a yield of 89.0 . The analytical values of this product were found to be in agreement with those of the product ill Example 6.
