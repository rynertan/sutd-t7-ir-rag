# Decorative emblem and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
The invention relates to decorative plaques and emb lems, and to methods of making the same. In one embodiment, a decorative emblem 10 is formed by insertion of a decorative foil shape 18 into a preformed bezel 12 and encapsulating and bonding the foil to the bezel with a fluent, curable plastic material 14 . After an initial casting of a measured amount 16 of plastic onto the base of the bezel, the foil 18 is inserted and seated. A second cast 20 of plastic forms a cap contiguous with the sides of the bezel and encapsulates the foil and bonds it within the bezel. Upon curing, the plastic cap gives a lens effect to the decora tive emblem.
