## Description
DEVICES FOR RECOVERING SOLAR ENERGY.The present invention relates to devices capable of catching the heat of the sun rays in order to heat fluids.Devices of various kinds and shapes are known, and are no wadays being accepted into common usage, by which the heat of the sun rays is caught in order to heat fluids.These devices are commonly named solar captors, solar collectors, solar panels or still otherwise.For sake of clarity and of general understanding, the expression solar energy captors is preferred and will be used hereinafter.In a very general way, a solar energy captor is made up by the following components one or more screens of transparent material a black or dark coloured surface, capable of absorbing the sun rays a system of ducts wherein the fluid to be heated is made to circulate, said fluid being either air or water or any aqueous solution or a liquid different from water a layer of insulating material, capable of retaining heat in order to limit any heat loss finally, a supporting structure. In the majority of the models that have been constructed up to date, the supporting structure is similar to a win dow frame, thus defining a panel or the like this gave ri se to the common expression solar panels . Also, in most of the models, the metal surface is that of a metal sheet suitably blackened and the fluid ducts are ob tained by shaping the said sheet and joining it with ano ther sheet, shaped as well, in order to leave between bo th sheets elongated and interconnected cavities such as will form indeed a system of ducts. In other models, the blackened metal sheet is welded to tu bes, also of metal, or the black surface belongs to metal fins integrally formed with said tubes, during their manu facturing. Still other models of solar energy captors are known whose bXack surface belongs to sheets of plastic ma terials such as polypropylene, or of elastomers such as thylene propylene copolymers, or else the ducts are obtained by extrusion, within said sheets, when manufacturing them. As these short notes make it clear, in the solar energy captors knawn to date use is made of materials chosen from among those industrially currently available ho wever, they are converted into structural shapes especial ly suited for being used in said captors.Furthermore, whatever the structure of the solar energy captor, all known models are independent and self contai ned units that must be superposed, for instance, on a terrace or on the roof of a building, thus requiring conside rable work for their installation, for connection with hZ draulic circuits and so on, the cost of which bears heavi ly on the overall cost of recovering the solar energy.It is the main object of the present invention to provide a solar energy captor as integral structure with the buil ding to whose service the heat recovered by said captor is destined.It is another object of the present invention to provide a solar energy captor built in the covering or roofing of the building which it serves and including means that allow a natural circulation of the fluid, especially water, that it is desired to heat.It is a further object of the present invention to provide a solar energy captor which affords a considerable saving on all counts, including the cost of the materials u sed, the construction and installation costs, the cost of maintenance during operation, while performing the recove ry of eat as efficiently as any other.These objects and other more are achieved by means of a so lar energy captor of the type in which a surface, having a high absorption power for the radiation to which it is exposed, is in heat exchange contact with a fluid to be hea ted, characterized by the fact that said surface is a membrane, of a material closen from among those currently avai lable as permanent waterproofing membranes in the building industry, that forms the ouside boundary of a flow cavity for the fluid to be heated, said membrane being preferably chosen from among the class of materials including asphalt sheets, tarred paper, tarred felts, elastomeric membranes and membranes bonded with metal sheets, whereby said metal sheets may be so treated as to afford selective absorption id est, widely different coefficients of absorption for radiations of the various wavelengths.According to a first general embodiment of the solar energy captor of the present invention said cavity is formed between said membrane and a sheet that is impermeable with respect to the fluid to be heated, the spacing between said membrane and said impermeable sheet being maintained by spa cers that afford at the same time a specified and controlled degree of resistance to the fluid to be heated, parallelly flowing to the surface of said membrane and imperme ble sheet.In a preferred embodiment of the solar energy captor accor ding to the present invention, said impermeable sheet is the same as is usually used on the roofs of buildings in order to protect the underlying structures against rainwater seeping in, while the spacing means between said imper me able sheet and the solar radiation absorbing membrane consists of a layer of controlled size gravel or other mate rial permeable to the fluid being heated, said fluid flowing through said gravel layer in a natural percolation mo tion, due to the natural slope of the roof itself from a fluid supplying and distributiong upstream channel to a downstream channel or gutter that will collect the heated fluid and take it away.The present invention, as described above, concerns the use of a specific class of materials in the same structural form as is available from the trade.An advantage thereof is obviously a very low cost this is the easier to attain inasmuch as said class of materials is currently and wiledly used in the construction trades as waterproofing layers and coverings, and is characterized by unit cost generally on the low side.The preferred class of materials, whose use is covered by the present invention, is that comprising asphalt sheets, tarred paper, tarred felts and elastomeric membranes.These materials are in the form of flexible waterproof she ets, whose edges can be other welded or glued togeter so as to realize, once installed, impermeable barriers with no gaps at all. Among the materials of this class, those longest known, but nevertheles still used nowadays, have a support of real felt made of natural fibres more recently, said support has been replaced by paper or paperboard, while tar was used for impregnation. This is the origin of the expressions tarred paper and tarred felt . Still more recently however, these materials have been improved by using, instead of the felt paper, a support made with a special non woven glass fibre felt, which is further reinforced, in some instances, by a glass fibre network or woven cloth in other instances, the the glass fibre support is replaced by jute, by a metal cloth, by polyester synthetic fibres, or by still other materials.The products used for impregnation have also been improved in the course of time nowadays, they are mainly obta ined by blending possible oxidized bitumens complying with particular theologic specifications, organic polymers such as atactic polypropylente, elastomers, stable plasticizers that will not migrate or segregate and finally very fine grained inorganic dust fillers. In order to distinguish them from the older types, the modern materials presently being offered by the trade are usually called asphalt sheets or membranes.Since some of the blends in use are very rich of elastomers and contain very little bitumen or a sphalt, or even none at all, while still other products are offered by the trade for use as permanent waterproofing membranes, which can hardly be defined as asphalt , tbitu meon , or elastomers, it is herein preferred to use the name membranes , in a general way, with no adjectives. Some varieties of membranes available from the trade carry moreover on one face a sheet of aluminium or copper or stainless steel, as much thin as to not impair their flexibility, that is bonded thereto in the course of their manuf a cturing process.It is appropriate to mention here those special chemical or eletrochemical processes that have been found recently, one of which is described, for example, in the Italian patent application No. 49262 A 77 filed onMay 4th, 1977, in the names of Messrs. Airola, Brossa andFerrari, according to which it is possible to coat any sur face of aluminium, copper or stainless steel with layers of metallic oxides, selenides or tellurides that are not only black, i.e. strongly absorbing for those radiations that prevail in the solar spectrum and having wavelenghts in the range between 3 and 2.5 micrometres, but that also show, on the other hand, a very low emission coefficient for infrared radiation, especially in the range between 2.5 and 20.0 micrometres, that characterizes in the heat loss from moderately hot surfaces due to radiation.As a result of said treatment , said metals can be , J9i ,Cà t h 2 lective behaviour, that is particularly efficient in rectl vering the solar energy.Membranes bonded with selective absorption metal sheets ol the above type can obviously find a very convenient use in solar energy captors according to the present invention.The present invention is based on the fact that all the bo ve described materials are naturally SAck and that they tend to reach a high temperature when exposed to the sun.In order to use them as solar energy captors, it is sufficient to build appropriate structures, wherein said materials join the other components that, in a general way, make up a solar energy captor, and that have been mentioned above.The peculiar aspects and advantages of the present invention will appear more clearly from the following description of a preferred embodyment, whose purpose is descripti ve only, but by no means limiting, with reference to the enclosed drawings in which fig. 1 is a schematic section across a solar energy captor according to the invention applied on a sloping roof said section is obtained by ideally cutting said captor and roof by means of a vertical plane parallel to the line of maximun slope of the roof fig. 2 is a cross section of the same captor and roof on a larger scale, according to the lines Il Il of fig. 1.Referring now to the drawing, reference 15 generally represents the structure supporting the solar energy captor, for example the structure of a roof or terrace, upon which a layer 8 of a termally insulating material is superim posed, which is covered in turn by a waterproof sheet 7, the latter being shaped as necessary to form the inner sur face of a cavity 17, as well as a header channel 10 for sue plying the fluid, namely water, to be heated, and a gutter channel 9 for collecting the heated fluid.The outer surface of cavity 17 is formed by membrane 4 ma de by any of the above described materials, that will absord the solar radiation.In the cavity 17 there are joists 6 of a type customary in roofings, and the cavity itself is filled up with a layer of controlled size gravel, whose purpose it is to slow do wn the fluid flowing along the said cavity, from header 10 to gutter 9, to a specified and controlled extent, in order to ensure that said fluid will be in contact with the inner face of the membrane 4 during a predetermined and sufficient time.It is thus possible to heat the fluid to an extent that will obviously depend on a number of parameters, including for instance the orientation of surface 4, the latitude of the location where it is installed, the season of the year, and so on.It is also clear that the degree of resistance against flu id flow as caused by the layer 5 must be specified as a function of the slope ot the roof on which the solar ener gy captor is laid.References 11 and 12 designate elements of thermally insu lating material, shaped in order to provide thermal insulation for the header and collector channels of the fluid to be heated, while numbers 13 and 14 show tiles that will cover and protect said channels.Another set of joist 3 supports, above the membrane 4, by known connecting means 2, a sheet 1 of a transparent barrier material, particularly and preferably a sheet of glass reinforced polyester resin.The details of the above described example are by no means limiting, and the following comments are intended to show the main variations that may be found expedient to intro duce at times, for the best use of the present invention in accordance with the requirements of each particular ap plication that is desired.Firstly, the structure described in the example is intendedfor heating pure water this is supplied to the header channel with a controlled flow in order to keep the water surface exactly level with the leading edge of the permea ble layer 5 the water will percolate along said permeable layer while getting heated owing to the contact with the membrane 4 being collected in the gutter 9. Whenever it rains, the structure described in the example will behave like a very usual roof gutter 9 will indeed collect rain water from the upper surface of screen 1, like any usual gutter. To this end, it is necessary to implement said structure with automatic devices of well known types, that are therefore not shown, which will stop supplying water to be heated whenever the sunshine fades, and will, on the other hand, deviate the cold rainwater towards a disposal. If it is desired to heat a fluid different from pure water, it is then preferable to provide an upper enclosure for channel 9, possibly sealkight,by extending the membrane 4 to the outer edge of the channel 9 and letting rainwater drain into a separate gutter. Secondly and in particular cases, for instance when the slope of the roof or covering is not sufficient to drive the fluid percolating through the cavity 17, a source of vacuum or reduced pressure may be provided downstream of the solar energy captor in order to help the fluid move in the desired sense, in this case too the channel 9 being closed in a sealtight manner, e.g. as above described. Thirdly, the permeable sheet is made, in the example shown, of controlled size gravel that is made to stick onto the underlying layer 7 by means of bitumen. It is obviously lssLble to substitute for the gravel any other peimeiJe substance llat oill stay permeable over a ny time lenght, when submitted to the specific conditions of this use.Accordingly, the assembly of gravel and joists 6 can be re placed by either solid elements or lattice shaped elements that can be made of any rigid material, including for exam ple grid like members of rigid synthetic plastic materials, of metals, of ceramics, of glass, of cement, of bituminous compounds and so on, wherein appropriate grooves or an open structure provide passages for the fluid flow, while affording the desired degree of resistance. Of course the spacing elements or material will be selected depending on the desired or necessary resistance to the flow of fluid to be heated, the latter in turn being controlled by the stated factors slope, desired flow rate, ecc. . Similar results are obtained by using elements of fabric, felt or mats , both woven or non woven.Finally, the waterproof sheet 7 of the example has also the characteristic properties of a membrane, and it can be placed between the insulating layer 8 and the support structure 15 when the known technique called inverse ro of is used, or it can even be missing altogether, when permitted by the nature of the insulating materials 8, 11 and .12 and of support 15.Waterproof coverings, built with membranes, are very commonplace in the usual building technique. As a result, the re are many expert technicians of this trade, who will find it easy to use the above described concepts in order to provide solar energy captors for a large variety of applications, while still remaining within the limits of the present invention.
