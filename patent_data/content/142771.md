## Description
Description NOVEL COMPOSITIONS FOR OXIDE CERAMICSTechnical Field This invention relates to novel oxide matrix ceramic compositions and more particularly to oxide matrix ceramics with high wear resistance and low materials cost.Background Art Ceramic compositions based on alumina Al203 have been in use for many years. Their applications in, e.g. the cutting tool industry have been recognized and utilized extensively. However, ceramics such as Al 203 ZrO2 and A1203 TiC ZrO2 have been criticized as being brittle or difficult to fabricate into complex shapes. Additional amounts of ZrO2 have not been found to improve mechanical shock resistance and additionalTiC has not significantly improved wear resistance. The search for improved ceramic compositions has produced compositions known as SIALON, an acronym for silicon aluminum oxynitride. This composition in its most advantageous application consists primarily of beta SIALON. However, this compound is one of the more expensive elements of ceramic composition and thus contributes to increased fabrication costs. This difficulty has been recognized and other starting materials have been proposed which result through processing in a sialon composition from less expensive starting materials. See for example, U.S.Patent 4,184,884. Others have sought to improve the composition of ceramics available for cutting tool applications and the like through expensive fabrication techniques such as for example, hot isostatic pressing. However, this also results in increased fabrication costs even though the starting materials may be relatively abundant. It has been recognized that the A1203 component of sialon can be increased, but uncertainty exists as to how much Al 203 can be accomodated in this matrix. See for example U.S. Patent No. 4,071,371 to Milberg et al. Kamigaito et al. has disclosed a composition of Si3N4 and Awl 203 which also include A1N in widely varying amounts, U.S. Patent No. 3,903,230.Disclosure of the Invention It is thus an object of the present invention to provide compositions for oxide matrix ceramics which have superior resistance to thermal shock, mechanical shock and abrasion. It is another object of this invention to provide compositions for oxide matrix ceramics which utilize low cost starting material. It is a further object of this invention to provide compositions of oxide matrix ceramics which possess superior resistance to thermal shock, mechanical shock and abrasion without requiring complex and expensive fabrication techniques. These and further objects of the present invention will be realized by consideration of the following disclosure and appended drawings. The present invention provides compositions for ceramics about 60 to 99 by weight of oxides, primarilyA1203, about 0.1 to 40 by weight of nitride modifiers, and about 0 to 40 by weight of nitride, carbide or carbonitride dispersion particles.Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 is a ternary constitution diagram showing the composition ranges of the oxide matrix mixtures which form ceramic embodiments of the present invention Figures 2 thru 5 are graphs demonstrating the wear comparison between various ceramic embod iments made according to the present invention and commercially available ceramic tools.Best Mode For Practicing the Invention The oxide matrix ceramics provided by the present invention include a novel series of ceramic compositions which improve the performance of ceramics as, for example, wear parts, electronic substrates, cutting tools, and engine components. The limitations of ceramics composed of Al 203 and ZrO2, and A12O3, TiC and ZrO2 have been apparent in some metal cutting tool applications. These ceramic tool inserts have demonstrated sensitivity to thermal shock, mechanical shock and abrasion causing excessive wear or abrupt failure. The present invention utilizes inexpensive and readily available oxides such as e.g. A1203, MgO, ZrO2 as the basic ingredients or matrix ceramics, while varying the nitride modifier additives such as Si3N4 and A1N to improve this matrix in supporting and holding the dispersed particle additives such as e.g. TiC, TiN, TiC N where x y 1 and B4C. xy Oxides which are used in the present invention can include Awl203, MgO, ZrO2 and HfO2. Of these oxides A1203 is most usually the major compound and the additions of other oxides are generally held to the range of approximately zero to 20 weight per cent of the entire composition. These additional oxides can provide improvement in the composition of the predominately Al 203 matrix by serving as grain growth inhibitors, and increasing the resistance of the resultant composition to shocks and abrasion. In numerous preferred embodiments of the present invention, MgO is added to the predominately Al 203 matrix, generally in the range of approximately zero to 2 weight percent, to inhibit grain growth. Usually additions of MgO are in the range of approximately zero to 0.7 weight percent. Additions of ZrO2 and HfO2 are also useful in preferred embodiments of the present invention. Such additions, generally in the range of approximately zero to 20 weight percent, have demonstrated improvements in the fracture toughness and thermal shock resistance of the predominately Al 203 matrix embodiments of the present invention. However, substitution of HfO2 for ZrO is less frequent due to its increased cost and L reduced effectiveness in crack blunting. Additions of MgO and ZrO or HfO have also proven 2 2 advantageous in certain embodiments of this invention, generally when the nitride modifier additions are in the range of zero to 15 weight percent of the composition. It has now surprisingly been found advantageous to include limited amounts of nitride modifiers and other dispersion particle compounds to obtain further improvements of the oxide matrix. These nitride modifiers include Si N and A1N generally in the range of zero to 20 weight per cent of the resultant composition. More usually, an advantageous composition representing an embodiment of the present invention is obtained with an addition of 2 to 15 weight per cent of Si3N4 to the predominately Al 203 matrix composition. In certain applications however additional improvements can be obtained by decreasing the amount of added Si3N4 and supplementing the matrix with A1N, together with the various dispersed particle compounds. These other dispersion particles, generally nitrides, carbides and carbonitrides, will also improve the wear resistance and hardness of the resultant ceramic composition and may be blended in various amounts in the composition to tailor the ceramic composition to a specific application. In general the particle dispersion compound consists of such compounds as TiC, TiN, ZrC, ZrN, HfC, HfN, B4C, and TiC N ZrC N , and HfC N where x plus y is generally in the xy range of approximately 0.5 to 1. These dispersed particles can be added to the ceramic composition generally to a final concentration of approximately zero to 40 weight per cent. The selection of the appropriate nitrides, carbides and carbonitrides for the dispersed particles is generally dependent upon the specific application for the ceramic composition. The disclosed carbides harden the matrix and are generally preferred in the order TiC, ZrC, B4C and HfC. The substitution of HfC is less frequent because of its higher cost and decreased effectiveness. The addition and substitution of other nitrides and carbonitrides is generally only required when flank wear on tools is a problem, such as e.g. when cutting certain metals. Such additions and substitutions can reduce wear and ultimate tool failure up to approximately 50 in such applications. The substitution of carbonitrides is generally preferred over mixtures of carbides and nitrides because there is generally improved performance and less dispersion problems.However, the cost of carbonitrides is often higher than the mixture of carbides and nitrides. Turning to Figure 1, the oxide matrix ceramics are shown as the major element or matrix with some substitution of nitride modifiers and other dispersion particles to improve this oxide matrix. The compositional tie line between 10 and 11 represent the approximate boundary of substutitional trade offs between nitrides for matrix modifications and dispersion particles.Thus, the composition of this invention are those contained within the boundary of the diagram and the above mentioned tie line 10 11. The more preferred compositional mixtures are enclosed within the trapezoid marked 12, 13, 14, 15.The compositions within this region provide the advantages of high oxide matrix content for low materials cost and ample matrix support for holding the dispersion particles. Within this region, there is provision for nitride substitution to allow matrix modification which improve the oxide matrix for most existing applications in cutting tools wear parts, electronic substrates and engine components. Compositions contained within the boundary 14 1516 provide even more benefit by their maximization of a high oxide matrix content with sufficient nitrides and dispersion particles to significantly improve the performance of the ceramics obtained therefrom, while maximizing the use of lowest cost starting materials. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, from 2 to 15 of Si N is added to the A1203matrix. The ceramics of the present invention are generally prepared by reaction hot pressing. This avoids pre reaction treatment of the powders which increase the cost of fabrication and raw materials. In addition, the reaction assists in the densification of the resultant ceramic body, while avoiding the higher temperatures needed for pre reacted powders. Such higher temperatures can increase grain growth and reduce the strength and toughness of the ceramic. In general, fine powders approximately 325 mesh are pre mixed and poured into a die cavity, which can be constructed e.g. of graphite. The mixture is then enclosed in the die with a punch which is capable of applying pressure of approximately 1,000 to 4,000 psi. While pressure is applied, the die is heated to the desired temperature, generally in the range of 1500 to 16500C. The conditions of pressure and temperature are maintained for a sufficient time, generally 15 to 30 minutes, and often the reaction is carried out in an inert environment, e.g. under nitrogen. Thereafter the assembly is cooled to room temperature and the ceramic body is removed. Under these conditions, densities of 98 of theoretical or greater are achieved. As an alternative, the compositions can be sintered by using pre reacted powder and cold pressing at up to 30,000 psi. Thereafter, the composition can be sintered at 1,650 to 1,800 C under nitrogen for a period of from one to three hours depending on the size of the ceramic body. The following examples are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure and its appended claims.Experimental The following Table 1 discloses compositions which illustrate embodiments of the present invention.Compositions are numbered and reference is made thereby to the experimental examples and figures when appropriate.
