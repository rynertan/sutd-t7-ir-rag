# Surgical instrument for applying clips to a surgical site.

## Abstract
An instrument 100 for applying clips to a surgical site has an applicator with two jaws 146 which are movable between open and closed positions. A mechanism 132 is provided for feeding the respectively leading clip of a string of such clips between the jaws, whereupon the jaws are closed and the leading clip is cinched as it is being applied to the surgical site. To vary the presentation of the clip, i.e., its orientation relative to the surgical site, the mechanism is mounted so that it can turn about a longitudinal axis of the instrument. In one embodiment, a slide button 148 is provided which can be slid forward and backward with one finger of a user, such translatory movement of the button being converted into a turning movement of the mechanism and consequently also of the clip which is being held between the anvils preparatory to its application to the surgical site. In another embodiment, turning movement is effected by rotating a knob 248 secured to the mechanism.
