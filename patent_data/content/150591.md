# A sealed fluid swivel joint.

## Abstract
A seal arrangement for a fluid swivel joint such, as is com monly used on offshore loading terminals for tankers, includes first and second adjacent joint rings 30, 32 which are rotatable relative to each other about a common central longitudinal axis. The joint rings 30, 32 have a small annular clearance gap 34 therebetween to allow relative rotational movement, and one of the rings includes an annular seal housing groove 42 communicating with the clearance gap 34. An annular seal is positioned in the seal housing groove 42, and includes a pliant annular, sealing member 44 and an adjacent free floating anti extrusion ring 46 to prevent the pliant sealing member 44 from being deformed into the clearance gap by a relatively high fluid pressure differential existing across the seal. An oil injection system circulates a flow of oil between a sealing face on one of the joint rings 30 and the contacting surfaces of the sealing member 44 and anti extrusion 46 so as to remove generated heat and any seal wear debris from the seal arrangement.
