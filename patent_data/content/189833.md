# Use of methylene azelaic acid as a corrosion inhibitor.

## Abstract
The use of methylene azelaic acid or an alkali metal salt thereof in glycol and water based automotive antifreeze formulations is described. Unlike natural dicarboxylic acids such as sebacic acid, methylene azelaic acid does not form a precipitate and drop out of solution, rendering the antifreeze unprotected against corrosion. The methylene azelaic acid component should be present in an amount of from 1.5 to 4.5 wt. based on the glycol component.
