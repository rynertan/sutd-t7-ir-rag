# DUAL ALLOY COOLED TURBINE WHEEL AND METHOD FOR ITS MANUFACTURE

## Abstract
A dual alloy cooled turbine wheel is manufactured by casting a hollow cylinder 1 of first nickel base alloy material with high creep resistance to produce directionally oriented grain boundaries. A preform 2 of a second nickel base alloy material with high tensile strength and high low cycle fatigue strength is diffusion bonded into the bore 1A of the hollow cylinder 1 by subjecting the cylinder and preform to hot isostatic pressing. The resulting cylindrical block 10 is cut into thin precisely flat wafers 10A . A plurality of align able holes 11, 11B for forming fluid cooling passages are photochemically etched into the individual wafers. The wafers then are laminated together by vacuum diffusion bonding techniques, with the holes 11, 11B aligned to form fluid cooling passages. The resulting laminated block 10B is machined to produce the turbine wheel 10C with turbine blades 13 through which the cooling passages 11, 45 extend.
