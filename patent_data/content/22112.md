# Weft reservoir for an alternate two pick change type fluid jet shuttleless loom.

## Abstract
A weft reservoir for a alternate two pick change type fluid jet shuttleless loom includes a continuously rotating drum assembly for provisionally reserving a weft continuously supplied from a given source and a control pin arranged facing the drum assembly and driven, at a prescribed timing, for provisional engagement with the weft being unwound from the drum assembly, thereby causing the controlled delivery of weft during the terminal stage of each weft insertion. Stabilized quality of the products with reduced waste of weft is attained.
