# ACRYLIC HOT MELT PRESSURE SENSITIVE ADHESIVE COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
Acrylic pressure sensitive hot melt adhesives having improved creep resistance at ambient temperatures and desirable melt viscosity at elevated application temperatures are prepared by copolymerizing suitable acrylic and methac rylic acids and alkyl esters with 10 40 percent by weight of an acrylate or methacrylate terminated vinyl aromatic monomer based macromolecular monomer. Compounding these adhesives with suitable tackifiers and plasticizers produces adhesives having low molten viscosity and significantly better shear adhesion, tack, and peel adhesion than is possible with the uncompounded acrylic adhesives.
