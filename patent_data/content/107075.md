# A process for the manufacture of mixed dialkylmagnesium solutions.

## Abstract
A process for making mixed dialkylmagnesiums where in magnesium metal is reacted with ethylene and an alkyl halide in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent and in a substantially moisture free and ether free atmosphere, un der relatively high pressure and at a relatively high tem perature followed by separation of undissolved solids from the resulting solution. A composition of matter produced by the process comprising dialkylmagnesium compounds having at least four different alkyl groups, a hydrocarbon solvent and a small amount of an alkyl or alkoxy aluminium compound.
