## Abstract
A harvester 10 is provided for hydroponically grown produce 40 borne in spaced cups 36 extending down through a flexible elongated strip 32 along the length thereof. The harvester comprises a frame 12 having at least one and preferably a number of guideways 28 each having a pair of elongated spaced parallel rails 30 secured in the frame and adapted to guide the flexible strip bearing the produce containing cups 36 . A strip guide roll 56 and separation means are also secured to the frame 12 for separating the produce bearing portions of the growing cups 36 from the flexible strip 32 during its passage through the frame. A strip take up reel 60 and means 62 for powering the same are in or adjacent to the frame. In one embodiment, the guide roll 56 is adapted to fully eject the cups from the strip and slide means 66 are provided for passage of said cups to a recovery area. In another embodiment, the guide roll raises the cups while the cups are still retained in the strip and blade means sever the raised portions of the cups. In a further embodiment a holder defining an elongated guideway for the strip is positioned in the frame upstream of the guide roll and includes blade means for severing that portion of each of the cups which depends below the strip. Such blade means may comprise a removable bade with its edge angled across the path of the strip and positioned below the strip.
