## Description
The present invention relates to a semiconductor memory device having a plurality of memory cells arranged in a matrix formed by word lines and bit lines connected to a data bus, and more particularly to a semiconductor memory device wherein the bit lines are divided into a plurality of blocks each including a plurality of memory cells, a sense amplifier and a switching element inserted into each bit line. Memory devices having a still larger memory capacity are proposed, with the result that the number of memory cells increases considerably with many word lines and bit lines connected to the memory cells. Accordingly, the stray capacitance distributed along the word and bit lines increases, which lowers the operation speed of the memory device. In order to solve this problem, it has been proposed to divide the bit lines or, more usually, the pairs of bit lines into a plurality of blocks, as disclosed in the Japanese Laid Open Patent Application No. 84 101093. Each block includes a plurality of memory cells, a sense amplifier and a switching element inserted into each bit line. Means are provided which are responsive to the selection of a memory cell to be accessed for activating only the sense amplifier of the block containing the selected memory cell. The switching elements are controlled after activation of the sense amplifier of the selected block i.e. the block containing the selected memory cell to make ON only the switching elements of the selected block and of each other block eventually located between the selected block and the data bus. The object of the invention is to improve such semiconductor memory devices by allowing a high operation speed while reducing the power consumption. Another object of the invention is also to increase the operation reliability of the semiconductor memory device. The above objects are achieved according to the invention by providing sense amplifiers having respective driving abilities which are different from each other and which increase as the distance between the corresponding blocks and the data bus increases. Thus, the sense amplifiers in the farthest blocks from the data bus have the highest driving ability to amplify the voltage difference in enough short time despite the load capacitance along the bit lines, while the nearest blocks from the data bus have the lowest driving ability to avoid unnecessary power consumption. Sense amplifiers having different driving abilities can be obtained by using MOS metal oxide semiconductor transistors having different channel sizes. The particulars and advantages of the invention will become more readily apparent from the following description made with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein FIG.1 is a circuit diagram of a prior art memory device with non divided bit lines FIG.2 is a circuit diagram of a column part of a prior art memory device divided into blocks FIG.3 a is a circuit diagram of a conventional precharge circuit which can be used in connection with a block of a column part of the memory device of Fig.2 or of the memory device according to the invention FIG.3 b and 3 c are circuit diagrams of two conventional switching elements which can be used in a block of a column part of the memory device of Fig.2 or of the memory device according to the invention FIG.4 is a circuit diagram of a column part of a memory device according to the present invention FIG.5 is a circuit diagram of a modified clock signal generator for use in a memory device according to the present invention FIG.6 is a circuit diagram of a block sense amplifier in a memory device according to the present invention FIG. 7 a and 7 b are plan views showing patterns of block sense amplifiers in blocks located respectively far and near of the data bus in a memory device according to the present invention and FIG.8 is a time chart for illustrating the operation of a memory device according to the present invention. A description of semiconductor memory devices according to the prior art will first be made. In a conventional memory device having a memory capacity of 64 kilo K bits or 256 K bits, the memory cells are arranged in a matrix as shown in Fig.1. In this figure, reference symbols C₀₀, C₀₁, , C However, when the memory capacity of the memory device increases to reach as much as a mega M bits, the number of memory cells also increases, and the stray capacitance distributed along each pair of bit lines increases compared with the memory capacitance provided in each memory cell. Therefore, the operation speed of the memory device for writing a data signal into a memory cell or reading a data signal from the memory cell is lowered and it becomes difficult to obtain a good signal to noise ratio, which causes a reduction in the operation reliability of the memory device. To solve this problem, it has been proposed to divide each pair of bit lines into a plurality of blocks. Fig. 2 shows a column part of a memory device with the i th pair of bit lines BL In Fig. 2, when one of the memory cells is selected by one of the word select signals, a corresponding one of block select signals BS Further details of the block circuits and of their operation when the memory device is in the read mode will be explained referring to Figs. 3 a to 3 c relating to block BK Fig. 3 a shows a pre charge circuit PRE The operation of the circuit of Fig. 2 includes the following sequential steps 1 one word line is selected by a word line select signal X₀, X₁, , or X In the above step 6 , it is not necessary that all switching elements be made ON. As already known, it is sufficient to set in the ON state the switching elements in the selected block and in the blocks located between the selected block and the column decoder CD In addition, also as already known, all other block sense amplifiers may be activated after the selected block sense amplifier has been activated and the switching elements have been made ON. Thus, in the known memory device of Fig.2, the load capacitance for the sense amplifier can be kept small at the first time when the block sense amplifier in the selected block is activated. However,when the blocks located between the selected block and the column decoder CD This drawback is eliminated according to the present invention by providing block sense amplifiers having different driving abilities. Fig. 4 is a block and circuit diagram of a column part of a memory device embodying the present invention. The block and circuit diagram in Fig.4 has the same constitution as that of the block and circuit diagram of Fig.2, and, in Figs. 2 and 4, the parts having the same reference symbols function equally. In Fig. 4, VSA In Fig. 4, for example, when a data signal stored in memory cell C The modified clock signal generator shown in Fig. 5 generates modified clock signals Thus, applying the modified clock signal generator to the memory device, the bit lines in the selected block and the blocks located between the selected block and the data bus can be connected. Thus, the load capacitance of the activated sense amplifier can be reduced as much as possible for example, when block BK When the upper blocks, i.e. the blocks farther from the data bus than the selected block, are not used, the pre charge circuits or bit line reset circuits of Fig. 3 a in said upper blocks can be controlled to be non operative, which also contributes to saving power consumption. As hereinbefore explained, the sense amplifier in the selected block first operates, and then the switching elements in lower blocks, i. e. the blocks located between the selected block and the data bus are set to the ON state. Accordingly, when the pairs of bit lines in the lower blocks are connected to the pair of bit lines in the selected block, the voltage difference which has appeared between the bit lines in the selected block decreases due to the stray capacitance and the potential of the bit lines in the lower blocks, which causes the increase of the access time to the memory device. Accordingly, it can be said that the access time depends on the location of the selected block for example, when the distance between the selected block and the data bus increases, the access time increases. The load capacitance for the sensing amplifier in the selected block is actually the sum of the stray capacitance of the lower blocks and the data bus. Therefore, when the sensing amplifier in each block has the same driving ability, as in the prior art, it becomes difficult for a sensing amplifier in a block placed far from the data bus to drive its load capacitance in a short access time. If the driving ability of the block which is the farthest from the data bus is made large enough to sufficiently shorten the access time, and if each sense amplifier must have the same large driving ability as the sense amplifier in the farthest block, this causes a waste of power when the sense amplifiers in the blocks located near the data bus are selected. The present invention solves this problem by providing block sense amplifiers with different driving abilities as a function of their location with respect to the data bus, the farthest block from the data bus having the highest driving ability for example, in Fig. 4, sense amplifier VSA Fig. 6 shows a circuit diagram of a block sense amplifier with a pair of switching elements, for example in block BK The differences in the driving ability of the block sense amplifiers can be obtained by changing the channel size of transistors Q₁, Q₂, Q₃, and Q₄. Figs. 7 a and b show plan views of the IC Integrated semiconductor Circuit pattern for the circuit of Fig.6, respectively when the block sense amplifier has the maximum driving ability, and when the block sense amplifier has the minimum driving ability. In Figs. 7 a and b , each dotted area is a pattern for a limited diffusion zone, each shadowed area is a pattern for a gate material made of Poly Silicon, each X marked portion shows a window for Al Aluminum contact, and each area enclosed by a thick line is a pattern for an Al wiring. In Figs. 7 a and b , w₁ is the channel size for transistors Q₁ and Q₂, w₂ is the channel size for transistors Q₃ and Q₄, and w₃ is the channel size for transistor Q₅. For example, when the memory device is in the class having M bit memory capacity and the channel size for the transistors of a middle block sense amplifier, i.e. the block sense amplifier of the block located at the middle of the column, is set as a standard size, the ratio between each channel size and the respective standard size may be as follows when the driving ability has its maximum value,w₁, w₂, and w₃ are longer than the respective standard sizes by as much as forty percent and when the driving ability has its minimum value, w₁, w₂, and w₃ are smaller than the respective standard sizes by sixty percent. Fig.8 is a time chart illustrating the operation of the memory device shown in Fig. 4. When the amplitude of an address signal A In the above example, at the time immediately after all switch elements have been made ON, the potential on the bit lines in all other non selected blocks is a middle value of the pre charge potential accordingly, the H side of the bit lines BL It could have been imagined to activate the sense amplifiers in the non selected blocks, after the corresponding switching elements have been made ON, if the selected block is far from the data bus. However, the control of the sense amplifiers in the non selected blocks would have become too complicated, whereas, in the memory device of the present invention, the control of the sense amplifiers can be simply realized. It can be noted also that if all sense amplifiers were driven when the nearest block to the data bus is selected, this would result in a waste of power and in electrical noise because the amplification of the voltage difference would be made too quickly and the noise would produce a wrong operation of the memory device. While the above description has been made with respect to a static RAM, it is quite apparent that the present invention can also be applied to a dynamic RAM.
