# Method, apparatus and recording medium for error correction.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for error correction are disclosed. This method essentially comprises the error cor rection coding processing and the interleaving and de interleaving processings for digital information data in the subchannels to be transmitted. And the apparatus com prises means for performing those processings. In more detail, the improved method for error correction of the present invention comprises the steps of dividing digital information data in one PACKET divided by sync signals into a plurality of PACKs as dividing units adding a first redun dant code for error detection or error correction to each of the dividing units and interleaving the digital information data in each of the dividing units and the first redundant code for error detection or error correction whereby the interleaved data is transmitted together with frame sync signals and main data. The data in the subchannels is coded and interleaved and then recorded so that the distances between the data become large. Therefore, if errors should occur, the interpolation can be properly done, thereby el evating the error correcting ability without requiring any complicated error correction circuit and any larger buffer memory such as those for the data in the main channel.
