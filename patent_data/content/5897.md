# Diffractometer and method of detecting a light diffracting specimen.

## Abstract
A diffractometer comprising means for illuminating a specimen plane and a lens for converging rays diffracted from the specimen plane. In order that an existing optical apparatus may readily be adapted for use as a diffractometer, the illuminating means 12a, 12b, 13, 14 are arranged to illuminate the specimen plane O O at an acute angle, and a positive lens 15 having its principal axis normal to the specimen plane O O is arranged to converge rays diffracted normally from the specimen plane. The invention is particularly applicable to converting microscopes for use as diffractometers, which then are suitable for use in monitoring respirable air borne fibres. Method of detecting a light diffracting specimen using this diffractometer.
