# Preparation of bromoacetamides.

## Abstract
Bromoacetamides of the formula ArCONHCH Br CONH₂ are obtained by addition to bromine of a solution of ArCONHCH₂CN in a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid preferably glacial acetic or propionic acid. This is an improvement in a process described in European Patent Specification No. 0059536 in which the bromine is added to a solution of the cyanomethylbenzamide, enabling consistent ly high yields e.g. 75 to 90 to be obtained.
