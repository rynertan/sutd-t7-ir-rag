# Preparation of nitroalkanes with actinic light.

## Abstract
Nitroalkanes having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms are made by reacting the analogous aliphatic hydrocarbon with nitric acid, or NOâ‚‚, in the vapor phase in the presence of actinic light. Lower temperatures and pressures are required than known to the art and the product is obtained in better yields and with fewer by products.

## Description
PREPARATION OF NITROALKANES WITH ACTINIC LIGHT Nitroalkanes are an essential stabilizing ingredient employed in l,l,l trichloroethane when it is used in vapor degreasing and cold cleaning. All manufacturers throughout the world add nitromethane and or nitroethane to their commercial l,l,l trichloroethane based solvents. Normally nitroalkanes are manufactured by a vapor phase nitration of the alkane with either nitric acid or NO2. There is a mixture of products formed due to carbon carbon scission. Thus, for example, when propane is nitrated, the products include l nitropropane, 2 nitropropane, nitroethane and nitromethane. Because of the oxidative conditions other oxygen containing compounds are also produced, e.g.aldehydes, acids, and carbon oxides. Patents disclosing such a process are U.S. 2,844,634 and 2,905,724. Improvements in these vapor phase nitrations are claimed by employing the nitric acid or nitrogen oxides together with oxygenated sulfur compounds, e.g. SO2, His04, U.S. 3,272,874 and by conducting the nitration in the presence of ozone U.S. 3,113,975 . Other processes involve nitration of paraffins by nitrogen peroxide NO2 2 in the presence of oxygen air under pressure at 1500 3300C U.S. 3,780,115 reacting an olefin with nitric acid in the presence of a lower aliphatic monocarboxylic acid anhydride to produce a nitroester and subsequently reducing with an alkali borohydride to form the nitroalkane U.S. 3,706,808 and reacting organic amines with ozone U.S. 3,377,387 . The present process is an improvement which reduces the amount of by products and obtains improved yields of the desired products by conducting the nitration of paraffins by employing nitric acid at lower temperatures and pressures in the presence of ultraviolet light. It has now been discovered that the lower alkanes containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms can be nitrated to yield the analogous nitroalkanes and or a nitroalkane having fewer carbon atoms than the starting alkane. The process reacts nitric acid with an alkane in the vapor phase in the presence of actinic radiation. Thus, for example, one obtains a mixture of nitromethane and nitroethane by conducting the reaction of nitric acid and ethane in the presence of ultraviolet light, having wavelengths within the range of 3200 to 14000 , at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 1300C at a contact time of about 8 seconds. The reaction to produce nitroalkanes at lower pressures and temperatures is conducted by exposing the lower alkane and nitric acid reactants in the vapor phase to actinic light. Temperatures are desirably in the range of 1000 to 1500C and the pressure is desirably O to 700 kPa gauge. A molar ratio of lower alkane to nitric acid of from 0.75 to 3.0 moles of alkane per mole of acid and a contact time of 4 to 10 seconds are employed. Preferred temperature, pressure, contact time and molar ratios of reactants are from about 1250 to about 1400C, from 0 to 350 kPa gauge, 6.5 to 9 seconds and from 1.2 to 2.5 moles of alkane per mole of acid. Although not required, it is preferred to conduct the reaction in a glass reactor so the reactant may be easily exposed to actinic light.Alternatively, the reactor may have a light well for the admission of the light. Conventional ultraviolet lamps are a suitable source of light.Example 1 In a representative example of the invention nitric acid was fed by a positive displacement metering pump through a vaporizing preheater, mixed with nitrogen diluent and a gaseous alkane, in this case, ethane.The molar ratio of ethane to HUN03 was 1.2 1. The mixed gas stream was then introduced into a reactor equipped with a light well essentially a glass window which admits an ultraviolet light source and steam jacketed walls. The steam pressure was regulated for temperature control. At 125 1300C, atmospheric pressure, and 7.8 seconds contact time, 18.1 percent of the ethane being fed was converted to 15.3 percent nitromethane and 43.5 percent nitroethane. The effluent from the reactor was scrubbed with water in a packed trickle bed column and the water analyzed by gas chromatography for the nitro alkanes. Ethane conversion was determined by taking gas samples of the mixed feed and reactor effluent and analyzing by gas chromatograph.Example 2 A source of U.V. light Conrad Eanovia lamp, 679A 0360 was employed using Vycore Pyrex and quartz glass reactors, which selectively transmitted certain sections of the spectrum, and employed as in Example 1 an ethane HNO3 mol ratio of 1.2 1 at 1300C, atmospheric pressure and 7.8 seconds reaction time. Table I shows the conditions and results of these runs using ethane and nitric acid.
