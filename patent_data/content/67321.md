# Power switchgear device.

## Abstract
A power switchgear device is equipped with a stationary contact 13a and contact maker 13 , a movable contact 11a and contact maker 11 , a commutating electrode 22 and an arc runner 13b . The elements are constructed and arranged such that when the contacts open, the resultant arc will be quickly driven from the contacts to the commutating electrode 22 and arc runner 13b , to increase the life of the contacts 11a, 13a and shorten the arcing time.
