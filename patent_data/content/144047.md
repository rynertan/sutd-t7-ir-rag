# A device in or for high pressure cleaning units for heating the water by circulation.

## Abstract
In high pressure cleaning units with heating stages. i.e. with a possibility for circulating a partial flow of the forwardly pumped water through a constricted, heat generating nozzle 74 in a return conduit to the pump s inlet side, the problem occurs that the entire water flow circulates at high pump pressure upon temporary interruption of ejection, which causes an inexpediently high heating of the water. By the invention, means are provided for sensing this situation and thus block the return conduit 70,72 , so that the pressure tends to rise in this way, however, the cleaning unit s ordinary bypass valve 12 will sense that delivery from the pump P is totally blocked, whereby it connects the pump in bypass state in the ordinary way through a non constricted bypass connection 14 . In this way, ejection can be interrupted temporarily without any substantial heat accumulation in the circulating water, and another advan tage is that the ejection conduit itself is pressure relieved in the said situation.
