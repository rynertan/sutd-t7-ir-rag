## Description
CRYSTALLINE COPOLYAMIDES FROM TEREPHTHALIC ACID AND HEXANETHYLENEDIAMINE AND TRIMETHYLEEXAMETHYLENEDIAMINE Background of the InventionField of the Invention The field of this invention relates to crystalline copolyamides from terephthalic acid and mixtures of hexamethylenediamine and trimethylhexamethylenediamine.Background Crystalline copolyamides from terephthalic acid and mixtures of hexamethylenediamine and trimethylhexam.ethy lenediamine have not been obtained by the prior art. In fact, U.S. Patent 3,382,216 teaches that the preparation of polyhexamethylene terephthalamide cannot be effected through melt condensation processes. U.S. Patent 3,150,117 discloses that linear amorphous film forming polyamides can be prepared from dicarboxylic acids and alkyl substituted saturated hydrocarbons such as trime thylhexamethylenedi amine hexamethylenediamine is not disclosed in this reference. Other pertinent references include U.S. Patent 3,294,758, which discloses that compositions containing greater than 30 percent hexamethylenediamine are brittle. U.S.Patents 3,825,516, 3,962,400, 3,294,758, 2,846,379 and 4,250,297 disclose amorphous polyamides. In reviewing all these references, it is clear that the crystalline polyterephthalamides manufactured from terephthalic acid and mixtures of hexamethylenediamine and trimethylhexamethylenediamine including filled compositions of these polymers having a heat deflection temperature of about 240 to about 3050C are unknown to the prior art. The general object of this invention is to provide crystalline polyterephthalamides and molding compositions reinforced with glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, graphite fibers or a mixture thereof. We have now found that crystalline polyterephthalamides can be obtained from terephthalic acid TA and a mixture of hexamethylenediamine HMDA and trimethylhexamethylenediamine TRE2fBA . The mole ratio of HMDA and TMHMDA can vary from about 55 45 to about 98 2, preferably about 60 40 to about 95 5. This crystalline polymer, when filled and molded with glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, graphite fibers or a mixture thereof, has a heat deflection temperature of about 240 to about 3050C, as determined byASTM method, D648.This is an unusual feature and completely unexpected, since amorphous polyterephthalamides have much lower heat deflection temperatures. The importance of having high heat deflection temperatures is that it enables the injection molded polyterephthalamides to be used in applications such as the hood of an automobile, shroud for a lawn mower, chain saw guard, and electrical connector applications. Our molded compositions have good mechanical properties such as tensile strength, flexural properties and impact strength. The molecular weight of our ccpolyamides is about 5,000 to about 40,000. Our novel composition can be filled with about 10 to about 60 weight percent glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, graphite fibers, or a mixture thereof. Advantageously, the molding composition may contain from about 20 to about 50 weight percent of glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, graphite fibers, or a mixture thereof. Our studies have shown that high heat deflection temperatures are obtained and the cost of molding products derived from polyterephthalamides are reduced by substituting for part of the polymer about 20 to about 50 weight percent thereof with glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, or graphite fibers.These glass filled polyamides and copolyamides are much more economical than molding compositions prepared without the use of the glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, or graphite fibers. Novel fibers can also be prepared from the polyamide and copolyamide derived from polyterephthalamide and this is indicated by the excellent physical properties of these polyamides. Our novel crystalline polyterephthalamides are suitably extruded at a temperature of 300 to 3500C through a fiber die having a multiplicity of apertures of about 0.06 inch diameter each. Fiber strands are suitably taken up at 10 to 1200 meters per minute, preferably at about 500 to 1000 meters per minute. The fibers are suitably taken at a temperature of at least 3000C., advantageously, in the range of about 320 to 3500C., preferably, in the temperature range of about 330 to 3400C to give fibers having a tenacity of about 5 grams per denier and an initial modulus of about 25 grams per denier. The use of polyimides and amides as engineering plastics has been limited only by their relatively high cost.Thus, employing our invention, through which the inherent cost can be brought down, the commercial application of polyamides requiring very high heat deflection temperatures can be greatly expanded. We have prepared monofilaments using our novel polyamide. With monofilament, the process starts with a single screw extruder to supply a melt for conversion to fiber. The die for monofilament is similar to the multifilament die. The monofilament is a slower operation process, typically 50 to 200 feet minute. For the melt spinning operations 40 to 80 feet minute were used for the monofilament processing. The monofilament, on the other hand, is water quenched with much less melt draw down. The monofilament is subsequently drawn with heated drawing systems. The monofilament drawing is done inline using heated ovens.

The reactant melt temperature in our process is kept in the range of about 250 to 27O0C. In the preferred process, the reaction is conducted in aHelicone reactor, preheated to a temperature of about 90 to 15O0C. In our process for the manufacture of polyamides, about equal molar amounts of TA are reacted with a primary aliphatic di amine, such as HMDA and TMEMDA. The molar ratio of TA to the aliphatic primary diamine may be in the range of 1.2 1 to 1 1.2, preferably in the range of 1 1. Our novel injection moldable crystalline polyamide copolymer of HMDA and TMHMDA comprises the following recurring structural units EMI5.1 wherein R is a straight chain aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing 6 carbon atoms and R is an alkyl substituted saturated hydrocarbon chain, 6 carbon atoms in length in which the alkyl substitution comprises 3 methyl groups with two of the three methyl groups on the same carbon atom. The preferred alkyl substituted diamines for our novel compositions are 2,2,4 trimethylhexamethylene diamine and 2,4,4 trimethylhexamethylene diamine or mixtures of these. Injection molding of our polyterephthalamide, filled or unfilled polymers, is accomplished by injecting the polyamide into a mold maintained at a temperature of about 100 to 2000C.In this process, a 20 second to 1 minute cycle is used with a barrel temperature of about 300 to 3500C. These temperatures will vary depending on the glass transition temperature Tg and melt temperature Tm of the polyamide being molded. The Tg and Tm of our polyterephthalamide are about 120 to 1600C and 300 to 3400C., respectively. The polyterephthalamide has excellent thermal and mechanical properties and can readily be molded into useful products or formed into fibers, laminates or coatings. The physical properties of the claimed polyamide are disclosed in Table 3. TheTg of this polyamide is 1490C and the Tm is about 315 3200C. We have found that the polyterephthalamide of this invention is improved by the addition of reinforcing materials particularly the thermal properties are improved if the polyterephthalamide contains from about 10 to 60 percent by weight glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, graphite fibers, or mixtures thereof. In the preferred range, the polyterephthalamides contain 20 to 50 percent by weight of the glass fibers, glass beads, minerals, graphite fibers, or mixtures thereof. Suitably, the reinforcing materials can be glass fibers, glass beads, glass spheres, or glass fabrics. The glass fibers are made of alkali free boron silicate glass or alkali containing C glass. The thickness of the fibers is suitably on the average between 3mm and 30mm. It is possible to use both long fibers in the range of from 5 to 50mm and also short fibers with each filament length of 0.05 to 5mm.In principle, any standard commercial grade fibers, especially glass fibers, may be used.Glass fibers ranging from 5mm to 50mm in diameter may also be used as a reinforcing material. The reinforced polyamide polymers may be prepared in various ways. Eor example, so called roving, endless glass fiber strands, are coated with the polyamide melt and subsequently granulated. The cut fibers or the glass beads may also be mixed with granulated polyamide and the resulting mixture melted in a conventional extruder, or alternatively the fibers may be directly introduced into the polyamide melt through a suitable inlet in the extruder. Injection molding of the novel glass filled polyamide is achieved by injecting the polyamide into a mold maintained at a temperature of about 100 to 2000C.In this process, a 40 second cycle is used with a barrel temperature of about 300 to 3500C. The injection molding conditions are given in Table 2.

The amount of catalyst present can vary from about 0.01 to about 0.2 weight percent of the total weight of the reactants. The preferred catalyst is sodium hypophosphite. The following example illustrates the preferred embodiment of this invention. It will be understood that the examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to be wholly definitive with respect to the conditions or scope of the invention.EXAMPLE 1 In all the examples, the reactants, 1.317 lbs. TA, 0.614 lbs. HMDA, 0.462 lbs. TXHMDA, and 0.87 gm of sodium hypophosphite, are loaded into a Helicone reactor that has been heated to 95 15COC. The temperature control is set at 2150C. The agitator is set at the maximum, 36 rpm. In the examples given in Table 2, the reactor pressure rose to 105 psi. The melt temperature was 2050C.The temperature controller settings were gradually increased to 2300C. The reactor pressure rose to 123 psi. The melt temperature was 2200C. The temperature control was then increased to 3150C. The reactor pressure was controlled at 123 125 psi for 16 minutes as melt temperature increased to 2600C. The reactor pressure was then vented down to 100 psi over a 17 minute period. The melt temperature increased to 3100C. The reactor was then vented to atmospheric pressure over a 2 minute period. The melt temperature reached 3130C. The reaction was then stopped by dumping the resin into water. The resin had an I.V. of 0.86 dl g, measured in 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane at a temperature of 300C. The filled molding compositions of this invention are prepared by blending the fillers and polymer and then extrusion compounding on an extruder. The extrusion compounding is carried out with the polymer in the molten state, generally at a temperature ranging from about 288 to 3550C, and preferably from about 310 to 3430C. Injection molding techniques which are used according to this invention are known to persons of skill in the art and are commonly referred to as reciprocating screw injection molding. In reciprocating screw injection molding, powdered or pelletized polymer is delivered to a hopper and from there fed into the feed port of a barrel, typically cylindrical, which houses a screw adapted for rotation and reciprocal motion within the barrel along the length thereof. The barrel also has a nozzle end opposite the feed end, and may have a chamber located near the nozzle end.Polymer fed from the hopper into the barrel passes into and through the area between flights of the rotating screw and, during such passage, is plasticated due to heat and the working of the polymer between the interior surface of the barrel and the surfaces between screw flights. Working of the polymer between screw flights and the interior of the barrel compacts the polymer between screw flights. After passing between the screw flights, the compacted, plasticated polymer accumulates in the barrel or in a chamber near the nozzle. During rotation of the screw, pressure, commonly referred to as back pressure is applied to the end of the screw at the feed end of the barrel. An opposing pressure develops due to accumulation of polymer at the nozzle end of the barrel, and when this pressure exceeds the back pressure, the screw is pushed away from the nozzle. When the accumulating polymer fills the chamber or the portion of the barrel vacated by the screw, or in some instances, when the screw reaches a pre determined position, pressure, commonly referred to as injection pressure , is applied to the screw, and the accumulated polymer is forced through the nozzle into a mold, which is commonly heated. In some cases, a booster is used to aid the injection. Typically, a non return check valve is employed to prevent polymer from flowing back towards the screw.Following injection of the polymer into the mold, the polymer is held therein, the mold is cooled, and the molded part removed.

Water content of the salt can range to 25 by weight. The preferred range is about 13 to 17 by weight. The salt is metered through a pump and pressure is increased to 1500 5000 psig. The resulting prepolymer then passes through a preheat zone where temperature is raised from about 425 to about 4500F to about 550 to about 6250F. The total residence time here is 25 to 50 seconds. The resulting prepolymer is then flashed through a control valve to give an aerosol mist at pressures of 0 400 psig and the polymer is then passed through a tubular flash reactor. This reactor is designed to provide a high heat flux to the polymer and has a wall temperature of about 650 to about 10000F.Melt temperature range is about 500 to about 750of through the flash reactor. The total residence time in the reactor is about 0.1 to about 20 seconds based on feed rate and pressure. The inherent viscosity I.V. is measured in 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane at 300C. Conveniently, the polymer is injected directly on the screws of the twin screw reactor denoted as ZSK inExamples 4 and 5 to further increase the molecular weight.Examples 4 and 5 were prepared as described in the General Procedure with specific details hereinbelow EXAEIPLE 4Monomers 65 hexamethylene diammonium terephthalate 35 trimethylhexamethylene diammonium terephthalateWater Content 20 by weight Specific MassFlow 145 lb hr in Residence time Salt reactor 100 minutes Preheat zone 40 seconds Reactor zone 2 seconds est.
