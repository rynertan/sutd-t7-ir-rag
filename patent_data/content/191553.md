# Steam turbine exhaust pipe erosion prevention system.

## Abstract
A steam turbine exhaust pipe connected to the exhaust system of a high pressure steam turbine of a nuclear power plant, and includes a moisture pre separator to remove water droplets prior to exhausting through the exhaust nozzles of an exhaust hood. The erosion prevention device is positioned in proximity to pipe bends between the exhaust hood and the moisture separator reheater.
