# CLAMP COPY CONTROLLING METHOD.

## Abstract
Clamp copy controlling method which has the steps of performing a sequence of a copy feeding operation, a return operation to the copy start point, and a pick and feed operation, thereby clamping and feeding at a set clamping level LCZ . This method further comprises the steps of storing the initial position A for the clamping and feeding and the position B for performing the clamping and feeding during the copy feeding operation, thereby specifying a clamping region H‚ÇÅ , sequentially altering the clamping level LCZ in the clamping region, repeating the control of the clamp copy, then setting the initial value of the clamping level if no clamping and feeding is performed during the step of controlling the clamp copy, and then performing the copy feeding operation to the next region set by the clamp level, the return operation to the copy starting point, and the pick and feed operation.
