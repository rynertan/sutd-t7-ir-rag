# Sintered stainless steel and production process therefor.

## Abstract
A sintered stainless steel and sintered seamless steel pipe exhibiting improved resistance to stress corrosion cracking are disclosed. The metallurgical structure comprises a matrix phase and a dispersing phase, which are different from each other in their metallurgical structures, the matrix phase com prising a substantially single ferritic structure, and the dispers ing phase comprising a structure selected from the group consisting of an austenitic structure, an austenitic ferritic dual phase structure, an austenitic martensitic dual phase structure, and an austenitic ferritic martensitic triple phase structure. The sintered seamless stainless steel pipes are useful as heat exchanging tubes and piping to which sea water or industrial water is fed.
