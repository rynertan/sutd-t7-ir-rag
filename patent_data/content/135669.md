# STEERING CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
The steering control system of the present invention includes a steering gear box mounted on an axle of a vehi cle substantially of the midpoint between steerable wheels journaled on and connected to knuckle joints on the ends of the axle. The input shaft of the gear box is connected to the steering wheel shaft by a slip joint. The longitudinal axis of the input shaft, slip joint shaft and wheel shaft are all angled upwardly and rearwardly with the total rearward angle be ing about 22 and the rearward angle of the input shaft being about 7 . Mounting the gear box on the axle rather than on a sprung portion of the vehicle minimizes impact forces due to rough roads from being transmitted to the operator through the steering wheel and from damaging the gear box.
