# FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A conduit for electrical cable, for example an electrical cable duct 1, contains a plurality of flexible envelopes 3 which are formed from a cross linked polymeric material, preferably a halogen free polymeric material, and which contains a non flammable liquid, preferably water. The envelopes preferably have a high elongation to break at the boiling point of the liquid so that they can accommodate some evaporation of the liquid during a fire in the region of the conduit without bursting.
