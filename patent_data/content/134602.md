# Colour cathode ray tube with an electron gun.

## Abstract
In line electron gun structure for color cathode ray tubes in which the final focusing and accelerating electrodes each employ three in line tapered, partially overlapping apertures in facing relationship, and at least one pair if integral electron beam correctors associated with the central aperture of the focusing electrode. Such structure is produced by deep drawing a workpiece having an hour glass shaped hole for each corrector pair desired.
