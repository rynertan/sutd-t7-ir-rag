# Apparatus for generating a pseudo stereo signal.

## Abstract
An apparatus for generating a pseudo stereo signal com prises at least two signal channels 3, 4 , each signal channel 3 comprising a delay line 7 of which an output is fed back to the input via gâ‚‚ . The delay lines 7, 8 have tappings 12, 13 and 14, 15 respectively . The tappings 12, 14 and 13, 15 respectively are coupled to inputs of two signal combination units 18 and 19, respectively whose outputs 20, 21 are coupled to two output terminals 22, 23 to supply the pseudo stereo signal.
