# Process for preparing an antioxidant, polyolefin or rubber composition including prepared antioxidant and electric cable formed therefrom.

## Abstract
Antioxidant is prepd. by reacting a polyphenol I having dialkyl 4 hydroxybenzyl gp s with a bridging cpd. comprising SCl2, S2Cl2, formaldehyde, dichloromethane or 1,2 dichloroethane where n is at least 1 n m is 2 6 R1 and R2 are alkyl having not more than 8C R3 and R4 are H or the same as R1 and R2 and Y is a gp. forming a core to which the phenolic gps. are attached. The antioxidant is used in polyolefin or rubber compsns. esp. for electric cable insulation. It is easy to blend because of its low m.pt. and compatability with the polymers and is less prone to diffuse to the polymer surface or agglomerate and crystallise. Polymers contg. the antioxidant are useful where water is present e.g. buried cables, hot water pipes and containers.

## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING AN ANTIOXIDANT, POLYOLEFIN ORRUBBER COMSOSITION INCLUDING PREPARED ANTIOXIDANT ANDELECTRIC CABLE FOBBED THEREFROM. The invention relates to antioxidants and more particularly to antioxidants for use in polymeric compositions and also to such compositions containing the antioxidants. It has long been knawn that water has a deleterious effect on polymeric compositions comprising polyolefins such as polyethylene, and this is primarily due to a loss of the antioxidants present in such compositions. The deleterious effect of water is more pronounced when the water is at an elevated temperature, e.g. greater than 6O0C it has been shown that the immersion of a polyolefin composition comprising an antioxidant in water at a temperature of 930C. is more deleterious than the effect of circulating hot air at 105 C. On a composition placed in an oven. A particularly important situation where aqueous solutions can be troublesome is in the case of a modern power cable having a polyethylene insulation which is at risk in those kinds of ground water containing salts. The antioxidants of the present invention are useful in insulation applications for power cables. According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing an antioxidant, which process comprises reacting a polyphenol having at least one dialkyl 4 hydroxybenzyl radical with a bridging compound which is SC12, S2C12, formaldehyde,dichlormethane or 1,2 dichloroethane, where the polyphenol is a compound of the formulaEMI2.1 wherein n is at least 1 and is preferably 1 or 2, and n m is from 2 to 6, R1 and R2 are each independently an alkyl group having up to 8 carbon atoms, the term alkyl as used herein including cycloalkyl groups, R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen or the same as R1 and R2 andY is a group forming a nucleus or core to which the phenolic groups, which provide the antioxidant qualities, are attached.More specifically Y may be a bi to hexavalent hydrocarbyl, thiohydrocarbyl, thio or dithio radical. Some specific examples of group 7 are EMI2.2 In an alternative embodiment, the polyphenol may be a compound of the formulaEMI3.1 where R 5 and R6 are each independently alkyl groups having up to 8 carbon atoms and Y is as defined above and x is from 2 to 6. In order to achieve the bridging of two or more molecules of initial antioxidants having a structure in accordance with formula II, de alkylation is required to remove one cr more of the hindering groups per molecule in order to free a position at which a bridging reaction can take place. This is preferably carried out using a Friedel Grafts type catalyst, such as ZnCl2. For an antioxidant of high solubility in n octane and in polymers such as polyolefins and the like which are non polar R1 to R6 each preferably contains at least 4 carbon atoms, and they may be the same or different. The initial polyphenol to be reacted to provide the antioxidants of this invention may consist of a mixture of different antioxidants having the general formula I, and or II,i.e. there may be a distribution of n, m, x, Y, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 in a reaction mixture from which the novel antioxidant is produced.In general the reaction to produce the present novel antioxidants involves the introduction of one or more bridging goups ortho to the hydroxyl group of the phenol.Thus a typical antioxidant according to this invention may have the general formula EMI4.1 where the bridging group D is S . S S or an alkylene biradical and R1, R2, R3, Y, n and m are as defined above.The compound of formula II is preferably an antioxidant sold under the trade name IONOX 330, or IRGONOX 1330, both of which are 1,3,5 trimethyl 2,4,6 tris 3,5 ditert butyl 4 Hydroxybenzyl benzene this compound has the formula EMI5.1 As will be described in greater detail in the following Example, this compound may be subjected to a partial dealkylation of the alkylated phenol ring followed by the introduction of a thio, dithio or methylene bridge.The introduction of these bridges may be achieved, respectively, by the use of Sol2, S2C12 formaldehyde, dichloromethane or 1 ,2 dichloroethane. It is believed that the antioxidant according to this invention which is obtained by the partial dealkylation of IONOX 330 and the subsequent reaction with S2C12, has the following formula EMI6.1 whereEMI6.2 The antioxidants of the present invention are preferably soluble in n octane to the extent of at least 5g per loOg of n octane at 200C. Most commercial phenolic antioxidants are symmetrical compounds with high melting temperatures and tend to be somewhat insoluble in hydrocarbon polymers.At low temperatures such antioxidants tend to diffuse slowly to the surface or agglomerate and crystallise within the polymer. The former process is apparently accelerated by hot water, since the mixture of water and antioxidant is less compatible with the polymer than with the antioxidant alone. The novel antioxidants according to this invention may have from 2 to 5 or more of the initial polyphenol moieties present in the molecule and these relatively higher molecular weight antioxidants are less susceptible to the difficulties referred to above. The novel antioxidants are particularly suitable for stabilizing normally solid polymers of alpha olefins, for example ethylene and propylene and their various copolymers. A wide range of polymers derived from monoolefins may be used in admixture with the present novel antioxidants to form useful polymeric compositions. The invention also includes such compositions. It is desirable that the polymeric compositions contain a stabilizing amount of the novel antioxidants according to this invention to stabilize the composition against oxidative and or thermal deterioration. For this purpose the antioxidant may be present in an amount of greater than 0.01 and useful loadings will comprise 0.1 or 0.2 of the antioxidant, although significantly greater amounts e.g. lt or 5 or more may be used the percentages are by weight. In addition to synthetic polymers referred to above the present antioxidants may be used to stabilize other polymeric compositions including natural and synthetic rubbers. The antioxidants and the poÂ¹ 1fler may be compounded using a Banbury mill or other means well known to those skilled in the art. The compositions are relatively easy to blend because of the low melting point of the present antioxidants and they have good compatibility with the polymers mentioned above. The following is a description by way of example of one method of making an antioxidant in accordance with this invention. 23.25 g 0.03 g mole of IONOX 330 were dissolved by gently warming and stirring, in 50 ml of dichlorethane. To this first mixture was added 0.408 g 0.003 g mole of anhydrous zinc chloride as catalyst. A second mixture was prepared by adding 50 cc of dichlorethane to 2.70 g 0.02 g mole of sulphur monochloride S2C12 and stirring. The mixture ofIONOX 330, catalyst and solvent was continually stirred in a flask maintained at 600C in a thermostat. The S2C12 dichlorethane mixture was then added dropwise over a period of 20 minutes to the mixture in the fiask.During this period the contents of the flask turned from colourless to maroon and thence to a yellowish brown. Ten minutes after the addition of the last drop the mixture in the flask was decanted into a litre of cold distilled water and stirred for a few minutes to remove catalyst and HC1 from the organic layer. The organic layer was then separated from the aqueous layer and mixed with 100 cc of xylene mixed isomers . The new mixture of solvents and antioxidant was heated to 1500C to drive off solvent. The purpose of the xylene was to convert any unreacted chlorine in the structure ASSCl where A is the original antioxidant minus a tertiary butyl group to formEMI9.1 When all solvents had been removed an amber colour glass remained. This was then crushed to form a cream coloured powder. The stabilized compositions in accordance with this invention find particular utility in the manufacture of high voltage polymeric insulation and cable sheaths.Such cables and the like employing insulation and sheaths which comprise a stabilizing amount of one of the novel antioxidants may be used in situations where there is present environmental water, e.g. in buried insulation, or above ground where the effects of weathering will be experienced. The novel antioxidants are also particularly useful where polymeric substances of te type referred to above are to be used for hot water pipes and hot water containers. The antioxidant resulting from the Example set out above was incorporated into a low density polyethylene supplied by Imperial Chemical IndustriesLimited under the designation XDB 58 at a 0.05 by weight level. The product of the Example was compared withIONOX 330, the starting material for the preparation,and the results are set forth in the following Table. The oxidation induction period was ascertained as this effectively determines the useful life of a polymer composition, since the onset of oxidation brings deterioration in the chemical and electrical properties.At high temperatures the deterioration is rapid once the oxidation sets in. Oxidations were carried out in 150 g 1 1 sodium chloride solution at 60 C and 900C, and in distilled water at 900C. Solubilities in n octane were measured at 200C and give an idea of the relative solubilities of the antioxidants in polyethylene. Note that solubilities are very much lower in polyethylene than in n octane because of polymer molecular weight and crystallinity effects.TABLE 1EFFECT OF ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES ON OXIDATIONINDUCTION PERIOD.

The results indicate that the new antioxidant is markedly superior in protecting polyethylene from oxidation in aqueous solutions, probably because of vastly superior solubility characteristics. It is significant that up to 1 of the new antioxidant can be incorporated into low density polyethylene with no blooming of antioxidant at use temperature ambient to 80 C . Further the procedure of the above Example may be modified to employ as the bridging compound dichloromethane or 1,2 dichloroethane it will be understood by those skilled in the art that these bridging compounds will preferably be used with a suitable Friedel Crafts catalyst, for example aluminium chloride. Also, the bridging compound may alternatively be SCl2 or formaldehyde. Further any suitable inert solvent may be employed.
