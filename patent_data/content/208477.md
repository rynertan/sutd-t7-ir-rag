# Process for producing chlorophenylhydrazine compounds.

## Abstract
A process for producing a chlorophenylhydrazine com pound is disclosed, which comprises chlorinating at least one hydrogen atom on the phenyl nucleus in a beta imidated phenylhydrazine compound and subsequently hydrolyzing the chlorinated compound. Said chlorophenylhydrazine com pound is useful as starting material for the production of her bicide, insecticide and photographic coupler is produced in high yield and low cost.
