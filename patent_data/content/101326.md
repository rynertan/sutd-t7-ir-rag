# A method of making an abrasion resistant coating on a solid substrate and articles produced thereby.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for providing an improved abrasion resistant coating on solid substrates such as plastic articles and solid articles prepared thereby having on the surface such abrasion resistant coating. A solid substrate is coated with an organosilanol type coating liquid comprising organosilanol molecules or a partial condensation product thereof. At least 90 mole percent of said organosilanol molecules are trifunctional silanol molecules of the formula RSi OH â‚ƒ, R being a hydrocarbon radical, and at least 50 mole percent of said trisilanols being an alkyl trisilanols of 1 3 carbon atoms or phenyl trisilanol. Preferably, at least 70 mole percent of the trisilanol is methyltrisilanol. After the coating is cured by a conventional means, it is post treated by a glow discharge to afford an abrasion resistance far superior to those obtained from organosilanol coating liquids without glow discharge post treatment. There is also disclosed a mirrored solid substrate such as a plastic sheet having an improved abrasion resistance which comprises a layer of a glow discharge treated organosiloxane coating and a mirror layer deposited thereon.
