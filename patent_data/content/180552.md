The valve 3 is operated by a cylin der and a piston 6 upon which acts, through the intervention of a controlling medium, the force applied by the driver in order to effect the braking, the medium, in the case of a unit intended to effect the braking of the trailer, being the medium acting upon the brakes of the tractor so that the direct propor tionality is achieved between the pressure operating the tractor s brakes and the pressure operating the trailer s brakes. Furthermore, the valve of the pressure modulator is operated through two pistons 101, 102 mechanically not connected with each other, upon each of which acts the pressure generated in one of the two master cylinders of the service braking system of the tractor, as a consequence of the operation of the corresponding foot brake pedal, the operation of said pistons taking place hydraulically or mech anically according to the type, hydraulic or mechanic, of the transmission. Furthermore, by passing the pilot pressure circuit, a valve 120 is foreseen which puts said pilot press ure circuit in communication with the exhaust, thus annulling its pressure and, therefore, causing the intervention of the automatic valve on the trailer, thus ensuring its emergency braking action. Finally, the modulated pressure from the modulator is sent, through a port 132 , against a surface of a differential piston 131 housed within a valve body 130 , the valve chamber being put in communication through a port 133 with the hydraulic oil tank, and through a port 134 with the tractor s brake pipe.

## Description
Description It is known that in the case the brakes of a vehicle, tractor or trailer, are servo controlled through a medium under pressure, provided by a pump, the pressure value should be adjustable according to the will of the vehicle driver, moment by moment and proportionally to the force applied by the driver upon the member controlling the braking action pedal or hand lever , so that it will possible to decelerate according to the needs. It is, then, to be kept in mind that, in the case of vehicles having a trailer, it is necessary for the braking of the trailer to take place with a noticeable delay with respect to the tractor s braking, and to be always proportional to said tractor s braking. Furthermore, noticeable delays should not take place between the starting of the actuation of the control member and the starting of the braking action. In some vehicles, however, as the tractors for agricultural use operating on wheels or track laying, two pedals are foreseen to actuate the brakes, these pedals separately controlling the service braking devices of the right. side and the leSt side, with which the vehicle is provided. The vehicle possesses, thus, the mobility which is needed for off track movements. When however, one must drive along a road, it is necessary for the two brakes to be operated simultaneously, and this is normally achieved by means of a latch blocking together the two pedals, or, still more simply, by pressing the two brake pedals simultaneously, by which action the brakes are actuated on both sides of the vehicle, or also by actuating one pedal only and acting upon the steering gear in order to maintain the vehicle on the needed course. In the case, however, that a trailer is connected to the tractor, since the trailer, if loaded, has a weight exceeding by 4 or 5 times the tractor 18 weight, it is absolutely necessary, when acting upon one pedal only, for the driver to be able to perform the complete braking of the trailer,apart from the complete braking of the tractor, whichever be the type of transmission of the controlling action to the braking members of the tractor, that is both in the case of a hydrostatic transmission and of a mechanical one. An object of the present invention is a modulating unit permitting to achieve the abovementioned purposes obviating the drawbacks presented by the servo assisted braking systems actually in use. Another object of the present invention is a device securing the automatic, continuous braking of a trailer, even by acting upon one only of the tractor s brake pedals. Still another object of the invention is a device permitting to secure the braking action of the tractors snd or the trailer even in the case that, by any reason, the modulated pressure, that is the pressure proportional to the load applied from the driver to the brake pedal or pedals, falls below the prefixed limit, established as a function of the pressure or the controlling force. Still a further object of the invention is to render feasible the utilization of the modulÅator as a Sower brake. The modulating unit according to the present invention comprises a valve,having an axial or rotationsl movement,which receives the controlling action through the fluid of a hydrostatic circuit, arriving from the controlling member pedal or hand lever of the braking system, the valve providing to adjust, by its movement, the passage of the medium from the delivery section of the pump to the return to the tank, in which the pump does the intake, so that the medium is subjected to pressure, thus rendering it apt to operate the actuating pistons of the brakes. Of said unit it is also part a piston or similar, which confera the modulating function to the unit itself, and which is operated by the pressure that is generated in the system in such way to oppose the movement of said valve. It follows that the force needed in order to operate the pump is proportional to the pressure generated by this actuating. The unit is completed by a centering spring, of a suitably limited load type, or by other similar means, so that, given the centering in the fully open position, the operation of putting the circuit under pressure takes place with extremely reduced loads exerted upon the controlling member, said loads being of the same order of magnitude of those needed in order to achieve the recovery of the slacks of the lever assemblies which are part of the conventionsl braking systems. The invention will be better understood from the reading of the description of one of its embodiments, given with reference to the enclosed drawings, in which Figure 1 shows schematically and in section the pressure modulating unit Figure 2 shows the arrangement of a device to achieve the complete braking of the trailer, through the operation of one only of two brake pedals of the tractor Figure 3 shows schematically the safety means ag ainst possible failures or operating irregularities of the modulated pressure circuit Figure 4 shows the the diagram of a device permitting the utilization of the pressure modulator as a power brake Figure 5 shows a modification of the diagram ofFigure 4. With reference to said drawings, and in particular to Figure 1, within the body 1 of the unit a valve 3 is housed which, by its movement, causes the variation of the cross section of the free communication port between the inlet A of the fluid oil for controlling the brakes and the outlet B which returns the oil itself to the tank, not represented, from which the pump circulating the oil does the intake.Through the bore C, the oil entering from A and fin ding partially or totally blocked the way of direct passage towards B, goes to the cylinders of the brakes, causing the displacement of the relevant pistons and causing the desired braking action. The valve 3 has been indicated as a valve of the axial sliding type but can be a valve provided, by instance, with a rotational movement. The medium will be subjected to pressure, and the pressure will be the consequence of the combined action of the pump and of the direct passage port between A and B the braking action on the vehicle will be, therefore, proportional to the pressure to which the medium is subjected. The unit must also permit the desired pressure modulation, according to a direct proportionality law or according to a proportionality law deemed to be suitable according to the requirements. To this end, a small piston 3a is foreseen upon which acts, through the bore D, the pressure generated in the braking circuit by the movement of the valve 3, said small piston 3B acting upon the valve 3 itself in a direction opposed to the movement to which the valve is subjected, so that by the part of the control device of the valve 3 the application is required of an equal and opposite force, and, therefore, of a force directly proportional to the pressure which has been generated in the braking circuit. As previously mentioned, the modulator of the invention may be applied to mechanically as well as hydraucally controlled braking systems. To this end, according to the inventions the valve 3 is controlled by a member, for instance a rod 5a, upon whose head the valve 3 itself rests, so that it will b not rigidly connected with the member 5a..The rod 5a can be actuated by the lever 7, or else on it the control piston 5 can be fixed which receives, through the port 3, the pressure of a control fluid , oil for instance, of an hydrostatic circuit, said pressure being determined by the force applied by the driver to the control member of the brake pedal or lever The medium may be that which acts upon the hydros8 tically controlled brakes of a tractor constituted by a wheeled agricultural tractor, the modulating unit of the invention being intended for the braking system of the trailer of the tractor itself, so that, by the effect of the previously mentioned modulation, also the direct proportionality is achieved between the actuating pressure of the tractor s brakes and the pressure of the trailer s brakes, As one can derive from what has been previously said, the actuation of the valve 3 is obtained, simultaneously and independently, by an hydraulic unit and by a mechanical member, through the application of a force by means of the brake pedal and or the lever of the tractor s hand brake.This feasibility of a double independent control is obtained, for instance, by foreseeing that the piston 5 be pierced through it, by the intermedistion of the suitable seals 6a Ge, the mechanical control member 3 of the valve 3 will pass,or else the extension of the stem of the valve 3, which will, thus, he able to displace itself by the effect of the control action imparted to it without a displacement of the piston 5 and vice versa. The returning of the valve 3 to the rest position, that is to the position of a complete opening of the direct communication between the inlet A and the exhaust B of the medium, is achieved, according to the invention, by means of 8 spring 4, having such characteristics to permit the reduction to the minimum of the load to be applied to the valve 3 in order to cause its displacement towards its position a reduction of blocking to the passage of fluid and, anyway, be low the value of the approach load of the actuating members of a conventional braking system, in such a way to permit that, in the particular case wherein the unit according to the invention is mounted on the braking circuit of a trailer, the braking of the trailer itselWill take place without any appreciable delay with respect to the tractor s braking. It is to be observed that it is suitable that in servo assisted braking systems, and in every case in which this appears to be convenient, the fluid between the inlet A and the outlets B and C be subjected to a convenient pressure, above all for the control of the automatic valve foreseen in another Ferruzza patent referring to A Continuous brsking system . The unit is also equipped with a safety valve, which is set at the maximum operating pressure. As it appears from the foregoing, by the unit of the invention it is possible to achieve all the prefixed purposes. In particular, the braking modulation is achieved in such a way that the braking will correspond to the force with which the driver actuates the relevant control members be it a pedal or a lever, whether the vehicle to brake is a tractor or a trailer or both furthermore,one can act upon the trailer s brake with the needed and indispensable advance.. It is also to be observed that the modulation itself of the braking effects the result that the braking system will answer with immediateness to the control actions imparted to it.By the modulating unit of the invention one achieves the real and basic purpose of the servo controlled brakes, that is to act as multipliers of the work effected by the driver. Lastly, it is to be ob served also the direct proportionality which is a chieved between the tractor s brakes actuation presure and the trailer s brakes actu5 tion pressur.e. With reference, then, to Figure 2, in order to ensure the continuous automatic braking of a trailer in the case the tractor is equipped with two foot brake pedals, and in the case of tractors e quipped with a hydrostatic trangsission, the linear or angular displacement of the pressure modulator s valve is achieved by means of two pistons 101 and 102, which are housed in a single cylinder 111, machined into a body 103. The body 103, apart from the pistons 101 and 102, is provided with ports 104, and 105 respecti vely for the access of the pressure from the master cylinder of the right brake, or respectively of the left brake, as well as with a port 106 for the inlet of the pump oil, as well as with a port 107 for the connection of the automatic valve reference valve , as well as with a port 108 for sending the modulated pressure to the automatic valve, and with a port 109 for the exhaust.. Within the cylinder 111, as said, two pistons 101 and 102 are housed, which are not connected mechanically with each other, as well as two shoulders 113 and 114 which limit the movement of the pistons 101 and 102, as it will explained in the following, If one actuates the right foot brake pedal, the pressure generated in the corresponding master cylinder, through the port 104, reaches the piston 101 and displaces it, so that the automatic valve will be displaced. The piston 102, on the contrary, will be not displaced since it is situated against the shoulder 114 of the piston 111. If one actuates the left foot brake pedal, through the port 105 the pressure acts upon the piston 102 which undergoes a displacement, causing also the displacement of the piston 101 and displacing, therefore, the automatic valve. If, then, one acts simultaneously upon both the foot brake pedals, since the pressures generat to ed by such operation are exactly equal each other by the effect of the balancing valve, always existing in the tractor s braking system , the piston 102 will be subjected to two equal and opposite forces and, therefore, won t undergo any displacement, whereas the piston 101 will displace itself, actuating the automatic. valve. The absorbed oil volume will be always the sa me for each of the three above listed possible cases.. In the case the tractor is provided with a service braking system having a transmission of a mechanical type, and, therefore in the case of braking systems of the mixed automatic type, it will suffice to realize for each foot brake pedal of the tractor a separate connection 112 which acts upon the abovedescribed device the connection, apart the feasibility of being of a mechanical type, may be also of a different type, for instance of a hydraulic electric type, and so on. The only proviso to respect is that the two connections shall be such that the movement of one of them doesn t imply also the movement of the other, but both shall be able to move if both the pedals will be actuated simultaneously.Furthermore, each of said connections shall contain a resilient member which will permit the back pressure acting upon the modulator s valve to cause variation of the movement of such valve with respect to what is imposed by the movement of the foot brake pedal ped s of the tractor, this condition being essential in order to achieve the modulation of the trailer s braking.In other words, the foot brake pedals of the tractor will actuate a suitable resilient member able to ensure a force proportional to the displacement of said foot brake pedals, giving to the driver the feeling of the load s increase, and which transfers such force to g piston acting upon the oil of a separate hydrostatic circuit or directly acting upon the distributor of the modulator, so that the proportionality will be assured between the load applied by the drive 6ipon the foot brake pe dals and the corresponding values of the modulated pressure, condition, this, which is necessary in order to get a brake of the continuous type, In other words, by virtue of the abovedescribed device, it will be always feasible, even acting upon one foot brake pedal only and without any mechanical connection with the other pedal, to achieve for the trailer a complete braking action of the ausomatic continuous type.. As mentioned in the general part of this de scription,and with reference to Figure 3 in particu lar, it may always happen that,for any fortuitous reason, as a disconnection or a breaking, an irregul sr working of the modulated pressure circuit, takes place. In order to obviate the serious drawbacks which could happen,a valve is foreseen, by passing the pilot pressure circuit, said valve being represented in the Figure as a valve 120 of an axial type, but which may be of any other suitable type, this valve being provided with a differentual piston 121, upon which , through the port 123, the pressure acts of the tractor s braking circuit. Through the port 125, upon the other surface of the piston 121, the pilot pressure acts. Upon the differential piston 121, acts, also through the port 124 the modulated pressure generated, by the effect of the operation of the foot brake pedals, in the pressure modulator.The piston 121, owing to the effect of said two pressures and owing to the presence of a suitable centering spring, keeps an equilibrium position , leaving free the passage of the modulated pressure through the port 124. If a failure takes place in the modulated pressure circuit, so that said pressure falls below the prefixed value prow portional to the hydrostatic pressure , the piston 121 displaces itself, thus putting in communication the port 125 of pilot pressure arrival with the exhaust 122. It follows that if the modulated pressure fails to reach the prefixed values, the pilot pressure falls to zero and, therefore, the emergency braking action of the trailer automatically enters into action. As previously mentioned, always within the scope of the improvements to the braking systems it is possible to utilize the pressure modulator as 8 power brake. As illustrated in Figure 4, into a valve bo dy 130, is sent , through the p ort 132, against a surface of the differential piston 131, the modulated pressure arriving from the modulator not represented . The valve s chamber is put into communication , through the port 133, with the brake oil tank, and,through the port 34 with the brake pipe of the tractor.As it can be observed, the modulated pressure acts in series with the load applied by the driver upon the pedal 135 through the action of the lever 136, so that the same values of the actuating pressure of the braking member of the tractor are achieved with a reduced effort by the driver s part, permitting however the driver to exert the complete braking action in the case of a failure of the modulated pressure circuit. In Figure 5 the differential piston 131 is shown separate and arranged within two distinct cylinders. The improvements to the braking systems, particularly of agricultural tractors and trailers, have been described and illustrated only by way of a non limitative example.. Within the scope of the technical equivalences, modifications can be effected to the described embodiments, without exiting from the scope of the invention.
