# Self contained breathing apparatus with provision for shared use.

## Abstract
A self contained breathing apparatus comprising a portable tank 10 containing a supply of breathing air under high pressure, a main pressure regulator 33 for reducing the pressure of air from the tank to a moderate level, a face mask 41 having a demand valve 39 mounted thereon which receives air from the main pressure regulator through a main supply hose 37 and which controls the pressure and flow thereof to meet the user s requirements, a bypass pressure regulator 35 and flow control means 36 which receive air from the tank and control the pressure and flow of air to the mask, through a separate bypass hose 42 , to provide breathing air to the mask in the event of a fault in the main breathing circuit. According to this invention, the bypass hose 42 is attached to the bypass pressure regulator and flow control by means of a manually operable quick disconnect coupling 43 , enabling emergency sharing of the air supply by a second, similarly equipped user. For use by firemen or other people working in hazardous atmospheres.
