# Spectrally sensitized imaging system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a photosensitive ele ment which comprises a substrate bearing on at least one surface thereof at least one photosensitive layer comprising a film forming polymer, a surfactant acid masked with a photolabile blocking group, and at least one spectral sensitiz ing compound conferring sensitivity within the wavelength range of 300 to 900 nm, i.e., the near UV 300 nm to 400 nm , the visible range 400 nm to 750 nm , and even into the near infrared region of the spectrum 750 to 900 nm . The composition can exhibit an increase in surface activity on irradiation with light in the wavelength range of 300 to 900 nm. In another aspect, a peel apart imaging article and process therefor is provided having photosensitivity within the wavelength region covering the near UV, visible, and near IR, yet having good stability of the unexposed material.
