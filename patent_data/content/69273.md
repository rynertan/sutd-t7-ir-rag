# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING LENGTH

## Abstract
A sensor of process velocity is utilized to provide a rate signal proportionally related to process velocity over at least a short term basis but subject to possible variations in the constant of proportionality. This variable rate signal is converted to a substantially fixed rate signal per unit length of material being produced by or passed through the sensed process by a programmable pulse rate converter controlled by a highly accurate but sometimes unreliable mark sense length measurement gauge. The result is a length measure ment of the passing material which is both highly accurate and reliable under all expected measurement conditions.
