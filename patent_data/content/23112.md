# Valve, especially for a tubing string.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to valves forming part of a tubing string used in testing procedures and wherein a sleeve valve member is used in conjunction with seals such as O rings in the presence of high pressures. To prevent the O rings become damaged as the valve member passes thereover a valve member 36, 37 including a tubular funnel 36 and a tubular liner is arranged in end to end abutment. Means 38, 39, 41 maintain the funnel 36 and liner in coaxial alignment and further means 58 hold the funnel 36 and liner together while the juncture between the funnel and liner passes over one 34 of the O ring seals 34, 35 , one on each side of the porting 31 , as the valve moves between open and closed positions. Said further means 58 also permits the funnel 36 and liner to move apart to open up the through flow cross section, in response to the valve member moving to the open position.
