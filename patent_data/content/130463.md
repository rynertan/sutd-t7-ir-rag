## Description
DAMPER DEVICE HAVING HYSTERETIC EFFECT SpecificationThe present invention has as its object, a damper device having a hysteretic effect, that is utilizable as a damper for motorcars particularly in supports and buffers or bumpers, or even in the buffers of trains, comprised by a pair of preferably metallic elements, apt for sliding one into the other, one of said elements bearing at least one perimetrical protuberance that is apt for being embedded in a tract of visco elastic material that covers the other element.The Italian PATENT APPLICATIONS Nos. 20502 A 83 and 20503A 83, filed on 8th. April 1983 in the name of the sameApplicant, describe a damper device that comprises a plurality of rigid rotating elements, interposed in between one sliding tract of visco elastic material and a sliding tract of metallic material, endowed with a relative movement such as to induce these rotating elements to revolve which causes a deformation of the visco elastic material, with a consequent dissipation of energy. Practical tests carriedout on said already known devices have shown that the damping effect and the resulting dissipation of energy, can be obtained even if the rotating elements are standing still instead of rotating on the tract of visco elastic material.It was the result of these practical observations that inspired the present invention, which proposes a damper device wherein the rigid rotating elements are eliminated, and which also exploits the Newton s dissipation that is had through the hysteresis resulting from the deformation of a tract of visco elastic material. Hence, any eventual damper devices which exploit a dissipation of energy of the Coulomb s type, i.e. due to the surface friction between contacting elements that slide one with respect to the other, can be considered to be outside the ambit of the present invention. In fact, any such type of dissipation of energy is obviated in the device according to the present invention, apart from being because of its particular structure, also because of the eventual presence of greases or lubricants, in general, that are apt for restricting the surface friction existing between the contacting elements.The damper device, which forms the object of the present invention, of the type comprising a pair of metallic elements that are apt for sliding one into the other, is characterized by the fact of foreseeing at least one protuberance, perimetrically disposed with regard to one of said elements and apt for being embedded in a tract of visco elastic material that covers the other element, eventual greases, or lubricants in general, being foreseen between these elements, for restricting any friction between their surfaces.In a preferred form of realization of this invention, said elements are constituted by a shaft, slidable inside a casing or collar, bearing on its inner side, a series of annular protuberances apt for being embedded in the tract of viscoelastic material covering said shaft, the mid section of the profile of said tract of visco elastic material, being either rectilinear or curved, as desired, so as to obtain or not a uniform damping effect for any whatsoever shifting, taking place between the two elements, from the preloaded static position. Further characteristics of the damper device according to the present invention, will result clearer from the following detailed description of a realization, made purely by way of non limiting example, illustrated with reference to the attached Tables of drawings, whereby FIG. 1 is a view of a mid section of the damper device according to the invention FIG. 2 is again a view of a mid section of the device ofFIG. 1, with certain variations in the realization FIG. 3 is a view of a med section showing a further variation of realization of the device of FIG. 1 FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate partially in section and partially in an axonometrical view, two types of realization of the device according to the invention, as applied to a motor car support FIG. 6 illustrates partially in section, the device of the invention, as applied to train buffers FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate partially in section, respectively under normal conditions and then after an impact received, the device according to the invention, as applied to a motorcar bumper FIG. 9 again shows the damper device, according to the invention, as applied to a motor car bumper, in a diverse form of realization FIGS. 10 and 11 moreover, illustrate some details of the device according to the invention and reference to these shall be made, for providing a correct idea of the degree of embedment required for the rigid protuberances in the tract of visco elastic material.With reference to the above said FIGURES, with the reference numeral 1, there is indicated the damper device in its complex whole, according to the present invention, in all its forms of realization and applications. Whereas, with the reference numerals 2 and 3, there have been indicated a pair of elements apt, respectively, for sliding one into the other. In the attached FIGURES, the identical reference numerals will be utilized for designating the elements which carry out the same function even if they are diversely disposed, according to the particular form of realization employed.For the moment, with making particular reference to FIG. 1 that shows a preferred form of realization according to the invention, the element 2 consists of a a rigid shaft whereas the element 3 consists of a collar, that is also rigid, inside which said shaft it can slide axially in both senses.In FIG. 1, as also in FIGS. 2 and 3 which shall be described further on, both the shaft 2 as well as the collar 3 are shown as having circular sections but it is obvious that said elements can also have diverse sections for example polygonal sections.The rigid shaft 2, presents a covering of visco elastic material 4 for preference nitrile rubber, inside which are embedded the annular protuberances 5 borne internally by the collar 3. The damping effect of the device is due exactly to the protuberances 5 which by being embedded in the tract of visco elastic material 4, tend to rapidly brake the axial shiftings of shaft 2.A power transformed into heat, lost through the hysteresis of the visco elastic material 4, becomes dissipated in the surrounding ambient through the rigid collar 3 and the rigid rod 2.It must be noted that the dissipation of energy is almost exclusively of the Newton s type since this dissipation is due only to the hysteresis of the visco elastic material 4, the surface friction i.e. Coulomb s dissipation between the contacting elements, being reduced to the minimum, thanks also to the presence of eventual lubricants introduced into the interspaces 6 that are determined in between the layer of visco elastic material 4 and the collar 3. For preference, the annular protuberances 5 are disposed at diverse distances apart from each other, for the purpose of obviating that any successive shiftings of the shaft 2 after a long stopping period of the device under a certain load condition could cause the annular protuberances 5 to simultaneously enter into the grooves left on the elastomeric material 4 by the relative adjacent protuberances.The realization of FIG. 2 differs from that of FIG. 1, owing to the fact that, in the former instance, the layer of elastomeric material covers the inside of the collar 3 whereas the annular protuberances 5, are made on the rigid shaft 2. However, the effect obtained is the same i.e.that of obtaining a constant damping action through relative axial shiftings between shaft 2 and collar 3. In the realization of FIG. 3, the layer of visco elastic material 4 covers the shaft 3 and has a parabolic crosssection or curved however, with having a symmetry with respect to the central part. In this instance, the damping action increases progresively with the shifting and, at the same time, in both the sliding senses of shaft 2 with respect to collar 3 for the shiftings around the condition found inFIG. 3, due to the greater embedment of the annular protuberances 5 in the layer of visco elastic material 4.Obviously, with a non symmetrical profile of the viscoelastic layer 4, there can be had differentiated damping effects in both the sliding senses of the shaft 2, with respect to the collar 3.With reference to FIG. 4, there shall now be described an application of the damping device, according to the invention, to an automobile engine support.In this instance, the element 3 has the form of a U shaped rod resting upon a base, and presenting the protuberances 5, at their free end, directed towards inwardly, for becoming embedded in the visco elastic material layers 4 that cover the lateral walls of the element 2 which also has an upturned U stirrup shape and which is also apt for supporting at least a part of the engine. Naturally, it must be understood that between the elements 2 and 3, there is interposed a spacer spring or suchlike means , calibrated in such a way as to keep said elements at a desired distance, under dangerous static conditions i.e. in the absence of oscillations. In FIG. 5, there is again illustrated an application, of the damping device according to the invention, to an automobile engine support, with some variations with respect to the realization illustrated in FIG. 4.In FIG. 5, the elements 2 and 3, for purposes of having a better clarity in the description, have been indicated with the numerals 2 and 3 , because, in this instance, it is the element 3 that slides into the element 2 , even though the function of both these elements is identical to that of the corresponding elements 2 and 3 in the realization of FIG. 4.In the realization of FIG. 5, the protuberances at the end of the stirrup 3 are turned outwardly, and become embedded in the vi sco elastic material layers 4, that cover the inside of the lateral walls of the superimposed stirrup 2 . As can be noted, the vi sco elastic material layers 4 have a curved profile, in such a way as to have a diverse damping effect depending upon the amplitude of the vibrations from that of the preloaded static condition.It is evident that in the realizations of FIGS. 4 and 5, the roles of the elements 2 and 3 can be inverted, and so also 2 and 3 respectively, by applying the visco elastic material layer 4 to the element 3 or 3 , and by making the protuberances 5 on the element 2 or 2 .In FIG. 6, there is shown an application of the damper device according to the invention, for a train buffer, operating on the same principle described previously. To the element 3, there is rigidly connected the cap 7, which is apt for receiving the impact. FIG. 7 illustrates an application of the damper device, according to the invention, to a buffer or bumper for motorcars. The rigid outer element 3, which acts as a bumper, has a U shaped section, presenting at its end the protuberances 5, directed inwardly and apt for being embedded in the visco elastic material layer 4, covering a metallic core comprised by the element 2. The profile of the viscoelastic material layer 4, has an increasing section, as it draws away from the element 3 in such a way as to have a greater damping action as the impact force increases.FIG. 8 illustrates the buffer of FIG. 7 after an impact has taken place.In the realization of FIG. 9, again for a car bumper, the visco elastic material layer 4 covers the inside of the element 3, and in it there are found embedded the protuberances 5 borne by the element 2.Of course, in the realizations of FIGS. 7 and 9, between the elements 2 and 3, there can be foreseen springs, or other elastic means, for spacing these elements apart after an eventual impact.In all these FIGURES, there have been omitted the purely elastic element, apt for returning the damper element to its at rest state. Said element could even be made out of rubber, or out of steel having a known structure.In FIGS. 10 and 11, there have been given the details of the damperg device according to the invention, illustrating a protuberance 5 about to be embedded he visco elastic material layer 4. In said FIGURES, thee has been shown, with a broken line, the circle of tangency of the maximum point of the protuberance 5, or osculatory circle. With r, there is indicated the radius of said circle, and with S the embedment of the protuberance 5 in the visco elastic material layer 4. For having a good functioning of the damper device, according to the invention, the ratio, between the embedment and the radius r, must not exceed the value 0.3 Z 0.3 r . Of course, to the previously described device, in its exemplifying forms of realization, there can also be carried out numerous structural variations, that are available to the technicians of this field, without such variations exiting from the ambit of the invention itself. For example the protuberances have a covering with a low friction coefficient base such as of polytetra fluoro ethylene
