# Apparatus incorporating a linear array scanner for correcting deformities in electronic images produced by the scanner and method of correcting deformities in electronic images produced by linear array scanners.

## Abstract
Deformities in electronic images produced by a multiple array scanner 10 are corrected by using the scanner to gener ate an electronic image of a reference pattern 62 disposed at the document platen of the scanner, storing that electronic image in a memory 72, producing skew, misalignment and misabutment signals by analysing the stored image and using the correction signals to produce a corrected electronic image of the reference pattern and to correct the electronic images of originals subsequently scanned by the scanner. The reference pattern consists of a horizontal line which is used to correct deformities in the images due to misalignment and skew associated with the arrays and a vertical line which is used to correct deformities in the images due to misabut ment between the arrays. A pointer system 74, 76 associated with the memory is used to identify a sequence of locations in the memory.
