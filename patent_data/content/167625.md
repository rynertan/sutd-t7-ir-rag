# SMALL RADIO CONTROLLED INDUSTRIAL HELICOPTER.

## Abstract
A small, radio controlled helicopter with an internal combustion engine with two opposed, simultaneous ignition cylinders to reduce ignition vibrations applied to the helicop ter body. Thus, when this small helicopter is equipped with apparatus for video recording or photography, it is possible to obtain clear picture images while preventing any un wanted movement of the camera. In addition, various other operations, such as the spreading of pharmaceuticals and the guiding of lead ropes, can be conducted stably.

## Claims
CLAIM A radio controlled miniature helicopter for an industrial use comprising by which characterizing a rotor main shaft and an even numbers cylinder type of an internal combustion engine opposite two cylinders of which are simultaneously ignited, together with a crank shaft of which engine is interlocked with said rotor main shaft.

## Description
SPECIFICATION RADIO ONTROLLED MINIATURE HELICOPTER FOR INDUSTRIAL USE TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a radiocontrolled miniature helicopter for industrial use, which is applicable to a video recording action, a photographic recording action, their combined action, a chemicals spraying action, a lead rope guiding action for a transmission line and a cableway, and other working actions. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND Hitherto, a conventionally used radio controlled miniature helicopter employs a singlecylinder miniature engine by which a main shaft of its rotor is rotatably driven. Due to such construction, the conventional miniature helicopter suffers from its body vibration caused by its single cylinder miniature engine operation which brought from explosion ignited, and consequently itis not applicable to an industrial use. Under such circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a radiocontrolled miniature helicopter, which being the least of the said body vibration or not suffering the said one, to be applicable to an industrial use. THE DISCLOSER OF THE INVENTION Namely, the radiocontrolled miniature helicopter of the present invention is provided with an even numbers cylinder type of an internal combustion engine in which a pair of cylinders are symmetrically arranged to form opposite cylinders construction, and these opposite cylinders are simultaneously ignited to rotatably drive a main shaft of a rotor thereof. Since vibrationmotive forces cuased by combustion impacts in the pair of opposite cylinders are offset with each other, the body vibration caused by such combustion impacts is drastically reduced to make it possible that the miniature helicopter of the present invention performs any working action in steady manner. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of an interlocking mechanism for the internal combustion engine and the rotor of the miniature helicopter according to an embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a plan view of the internal combustion engine as shown in Fig. 1, which engine is a horizontally opposite and simultaneously ignited twocylinder type engine and Fig. 3 is an enlarged cross sectional view of the engine taken along line A A of Fig. 2. THE BEST EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION The present invention will now be described in detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings which show an embodiment of a construction of a miniature helicopter equipped with a horizontally opposite and simultaneously ignited twocylinder type of an internal combustion engine according to the present invention. A body of the miniature helicopter 1 of the present invention is shown with the use of a one dot chain line, on which body an internal combustion engine 2 is mounted.Rotation of a crank shaft 3 of the engine 2 is transmitted to a reduction device 5 through a timing belt 4 and then to a rotor main shaft 6 to rotate a rotor 7 mounted on an upper end of the miniature helicopter 1. The internal combustion engine 2 is a horizontally opposite and simultaneously ignited twocylinder type engine as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, in which engine 2 two cylinders 8a, 8b are symmetrically arranged with respect to the crank shaft 3 in the same plane.Pistons received in these cylinders 8a, 8b are connected to the crank shaft 3 through connecting rods 9a, 9b, respectively, in which cylinders 8a, 8b the combustion strokes of the pistons are simultaneously performed. Now, action and effect of the miniature helicopter of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The rotor 7 of the radio controlled miniature helicopter 1 is rotated by the opposite and simultaneously ignited two cylinder engine 2 in an interlocking manner, in which engine 2 the combustions are simultaneously conducted in both opposite cylinders 8a, 8b which are symmetrically arranged with respect to the crank 3 in the same plane.Consequently, the vibrationmotive forces caused by the above combustions are offset with each other to reduce the body vibration of the miniature helicopter 1 drastically to the extent of one twentieth of that of the conventional miniature helicopter employing a conventional singlecylinder type of an internal combustion engine. Further, in comparison with a conventional miniature helicopter employing the same numbers cylinder type of the conventional engine, the body vibration of the miniature helicopter 1 of the present invention is reduced to the extent of one tenth of that of the conventional helicopter. The drawings show the horizontally opposite twocylinder type of the internal combustion engine.However, instead of this type engine, it is possible to employ a plurality of pairs of horizontally or vertically opposite twocylinder in lines type of an internal combustion engine each pair of opposite two cylinders of which lines are simultaneously ignited. Since the body vibration of the miniature helicopter 1 is remarkably reduced because of the above reasons, the miniature helicopter 1 carries a video camera and a photographic camera in a vibrationless manner to perform steady a video recording action and a photographic recording action under a remote control from the ground so as to get sharp image recording. Further, because of the same reasons as mentioned above, the miniature helicopter 1 can steady perform a chemicals spraying action, and a lead rope guiding action for a transmission line and a cableway. APPLICABILITY OF INDUSTRIAL USE By remarkably reducing the body vibration of the radio controlled miniature helicopter according to the present invention, it is possible to get a more sharp image recording than that obtained hitherto in an aerial video recording action and an aerial photographic recording action with the use of the miniature helicopter, and also it is possible to save manpower in the chemicals spraying action and the lead rope guiding action for the transmission line and the cableway with the use of the miniature helicopter on which a chemicals tank for an aerial spraying use and the like are mounted.
