# Process for producing silver bromide or iodobromide photographic emulsion.

## Abstract
A process for producing a silver halide photographic emulsion by supplying a solution of a water soluble silver salt and a solution of a water soluble halide in the presence of a protective colloid is disclosed, said process comprising, in sequence A the step of forming silver halide nuclear grains with a silver iodide content of 0 to 5 mols , wherein the pH of the mother liquor is maintained at between 2.0 and 0.7 for at least the initial half of the period of said step B the step of forming silver halide seed grains wherein the silver halide grains formed by step A above are made into monodisperse, substantially spherical seed grains and C the step of increasing the sizes of the seed grains by addition of a solution of a water soluble silver salt and a solution of a water soluble halide and or fine silver halide grains.
