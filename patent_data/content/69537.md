# CENTRIFUGAL SEPARATORS FOR REMOVING ENTRAINED GAS FROM A LIQUID

## Abstract
A centrifugal cyclone separator for extracting entrained gas from a liquid includes a cylindrical member 30 carrying vanes 40 which extend into the vortex created by fluid swirling through the separator. The cylindrical member is mounted for rotation about a fixed member 20 in response to action of the fluid on the vanes and relative motion between the cylindrical member and the fixed member opens and closes a valve in the gas escape route to shut the valve when the quantity of gas in the vortex is low enough to expose the vanes to the liquid. The valve comprises a rod 36 on the cylindrical member 30 which squeezes a resilient tube portion 27 of the gas exhaust duct. The separator is useful in the removal of small amounts of free hydrogen from an electrolyte and in the removal of gas from hydraulic fluids.
