# DRUM CONVERSION

## Abstract
To convert an open topped curled rim drum to a tight head drum a portion of the rim 2a is opened out by means of a lever or jemmy. The nose 10 of a plough 9 is then inserted into the curled rim, and the opened out portion is gripped between drive rollers 12, 13, at least one of which is driven. A support roller 11 bears against the inner wall of the drum opposite the plough 9. The drive rollers 12, 13 pull the drum rim over the plough to uncurl the rim and form it into a laterally extending flange 2b which is then formed into a cylindrical extension 2c of the drum body 1 for use in forming a rolled seam 7 with a drum end to produce a tight head drum.
