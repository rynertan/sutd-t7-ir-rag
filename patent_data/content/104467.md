# Esterified carboxymethyl celluloses and a process for the preparation of them.

## Abstract
New esterified carboxymethyl celluloses in which DS by carboxymethyl group per anhydroglucose unit is 2.0 or more, the ester group is a hydrocarbon residue having 1 8 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, n octyl or benzyl group, DS by esterified carboxymethyl group per anhydroglucose unit is 1.50 or more and the remaining unsubstituted carboxymethyl groups are in the form of free acid and which are soluble in various polar or non polar organic solvents and are useful as ingredients of paints or enteric coating materials.
