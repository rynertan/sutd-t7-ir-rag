NON A, NON B HEPATITIS ASSOCIATED ANTIBODY OR ANTIBODYCONJUGATE, THE USE THEREOF AND DETECTION REAGENT This invention relates to a type non A, non B.hepatitis associated antibody or antibody conJugate, the use thereof and detection. reagent. More specifically, the present invention relates to a non A, non B hepatitis associated antibody, a conjugate of said antibody and a non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen detection reagent containing as its principal ingredient said antibody or said conjugate of said antibody as well as the use of said antibody by a detection method. The existence of viral hepatitis of types A and B is known and antigen antibody systems associated with these types of hepatitis have also been clarified.Immunoserological diagnosis using such systems has become possible and development and introduction of vaccines effective against types A and B hepatitis have been accomplished. In the course of research, however, the existence of viral hepatitis which belongs neither to hepatitis type A nor to hepatitis type B has become known. The frequency of occurrence thereof is higher. than expected.Non A, non B hepatitis accounts for more than 80 up to 90 of post transfusion hepatitis and it has been reported that non A, non Bhepatitis also accounts for about 50 of sporadic acute hepatitis. It has been clarified that even among normal blood donors, a considerable number of donors carry non A, non B hepatitis virus es . The following literature references set forth the state of the art relating to non A, non B hepatitis 1 Prince, A.

Etiology of sporadic hepatitis B surface antigen negative hepatitis. Ann. Intern. Med. 87 1 6, 1977. The term non A, non B hepatitis used herein refers to those kinds of hepatitis which are believed to occur because of virus es other than the heretofore known viruses, such as type A hepatitis virus, type B hepatitis virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and the like, which non A, non B hepatitis virus es participate in the disease as pathogens and do not provoke a significant rise of HAV antibody, HBs antibody,HBc antibody and HBe antibody. Accordingly non A, non B hepatitis patients can be defined as those who suffer from hepatitis resulting from hepatitis virus es , but who are negative in both the type A and type B hepatitis diagnoses, and are therefore excluded from having either hepatitis type A or hepatitis type B.Generally, in comparison with hepatitis type B, the average incubation period from transfusion until outbreak for non A, non B hepatitis is shorter, and the maximal value of GPT is also lower. However, non A, non B hepatitis has a longer duration so that the GPT abnormality, for example, becomes chronic and lasts longer. In any case, non A, non B hepatitis accounts for the major proportion of post transfusion hepatitis, and liver diseases caused by the non A, non B hepatitis virus es include a variety of diseases such as livercirrhosis, liver cancer, and the like.Accordingly, proper counter measures must be devised as soon as possible. In particular, means for accurately detecting the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen in transfusion blood must be developed as soon as possible. As to non A, non B hepatitis, however, the virus es that cause the disease have not yet been clarified essentially so that an antigen antibody system associated therewith has not yet been established.Hence, proper diagnosis and vaccine production have not been achieved to date. In view of the background situation described above, the inventor of the present invention first attempted to isolate, as a separate substance, an associated antigen which is a general. factor in and is specific to non A, non B hepatitis. The present inventor succeeded in obtaining the contemplated substance by isolation and purification from a non A, non B hepatitis autopsy liver. The present inventor further attempted to prepare a non A, non B hepatitis associated antibody from the substance by an immunological method and succeeded, thereby completing the present invention. As is obvious from the above explanation, an object of the present invention is to provide an associated antibody which is a general factor in and is specific to non A, non B hepatitis and also to make it possible to detect a non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen by using such an antibody. The present invention will now be described in detail. The antibody of the present invention exhibits a specific antigen antibody reaction with the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen, and this property defines and establishes the antibody of the present invention The non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen is obtained by isolation and purification from an autopsy liver of a non A, non B hepatitis patient and is characterized by the following physicochemical properties. The molecular weight of this antigen is at least 1,500,000 when determined by gel filtration. Its sedimentation constant 10 13 is 51.5S when measured with the Beckmann Model E instrument.Its buoyant density g cm3 in cesium chloride or in potassium bromide solution is 1.15 to 1.25 when determined with anAbbeys refractometer. The particle size of the antigen is from 26 to 37 nm under electron microscope observation average 31.5 nm . The electrophoretic mobility of the antigen is in the a2 a1 globulin range when determined by immunoelectrophoresis. The antigen antibody reaction which the antibody of the present invention exhibits with the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen described above is specific, as will be demonstrated in ExperimentalExample 1 below. Consequently, the antibody of the present invention can be defined in terms of its ability to undergo this antigen antibody reaction. This reaction is also quantitative, as will be illustrated inExperimental Examples 2 and 3. Accordingly, non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen levels can be detected by means of this reaction. The antibody of the present invention can be directly obtained from the serum of a patient who hashad frequent transfusions or the convalescent phase serum from non Ar non B hepatitis patient, and used as the starting material by isolating and purifying the serum. Generally, however, the antibody is indirectly obtained by an immunological method using animals other than man. For example, as will be shown in Example 1, a rabbit is repeatedly inoculated, for immunization, with the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen, together with Freund s complete adjuvant, and the resulting antiserum is subjected to IgG purification fractionation, for example, to obtain the antibody of the invention. The non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen to be used in the invention can be obtained from the autopsy liver from a patient infected with non A, non B hepatitis, as the starting material, by a suitable combination of ordinary protein fractionation methods, such as density gradient centrifugation, salting out, electrophoresis, gel filtration, affinity chromatography, isoelectrofocusing, ultrafiltration, Cohn s fractionation, and so forth. For instance, the autopsy liver supernatant homogenate is first subjected to column chromatography using Sephacryl S 200 and the resulting antigen positive fraction is concentrated with ultrafilteration. It is ultracentrifugation and dialysis are carried out.It is preferred to carry out ultracentrifugation once or several times by using successively both sucrose density gradient centrifugation and cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation. Practical applications of the antibody of the present invention include detection of the non A, non B.hepatitis associated antigen, diagnosis of non A non B hepatitis, and prevention of non A, non B hepatitis.Since the antibody of the present invention exhibits a specific antigen antibody reaction with the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen as described above, it can be used as a detection reagent for accurately detecting the antigen. For example, a detection reagent for transfusion blood can be prepared using the antibody of the invention Similarly, the antibody of the invention is expected to be useful as a starting material for producing a diagnostic reagent for non A, non B hepatitis,and as a starting material for an immunoglobulin preparation for preventing non A, non B hepatitis. The detection reagent of the present invention is prepared from the antibody of the present invention depending on the immunological detection method to be employed. In other words, the detection reagent can be suitably prepared in accordance with the immunological detection method that is to be used. For example, when a test such as the micro Ouchterlony s test MO , immunoelectrophoresis IES, IEP , complement fixation CF , immune adherence hemagglutination IAHA or single radial immunodiffusion SRID is used as the detection method, a suitable preparation can be prepared using the antibody of the present invention.When the single radial immunodiffusion SRID technique is used, for example, a suitable substrate is selected from the group consisting of agar, agarose, starch, polyacrylamide gl and the like, and the substrate is heat dissolved in a buffer. After the antibody of the present invention is added and mixed therein, the resulting solution is flowed onto a glass plate or is charged into a plastic container and cooled to cause solidification. Finally, a hole for charging the serum to be tested is bored in the solidified gel layer. However, when a method such as reverse passive hemagglutination R PHA , radioimmunoassay RIA , enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay ELISA or the like is used as the detection method, it is necessary that the antibody of the present invention be prepared in the form of a suitable conjugate. For example, when reverse passive hemagglutination R PHA is employed, the antibody of the present invention must be coupled with fine particles. Although it is preferred to use the erythrocytes of mammals or birds, it is also possible to use fine particles of about 1 to about 10 1 , such as fine particles of polystyrene latex, polyester latex, vinyl chloride, bentonite, glass beads, and so forth.In order to bind the antibody of the present invention with these fine particles, it is possible to use, for example, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, tannic acid, bisdiazotized benzidine, chromium chloride, carbodiimide, and the like. When the radioimmunoassay RIA test is used, the antibody of the present invention must be labelled with an isotope. 125I or 131I can be used as the isotope and can be combined with the antibody of the invention by the chloramine T method. When the enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay ELISA method is used, the antibody of the present invention must be combined with an enzyme. Examples of usable enzymes include glucose oxidase, alkali phosphatase, peroxidase, beta galactosidase, and the like.Glutaraldehyde can be used as the coupling agent. The figure is a schematic diagram showing the state of formation of precipitin lines according to the micro Ouchterlony s test as described in ExperimentalExample 1. The usefulness of the antibody of the present invention and the detection reagent containing said antibody will be shown with reference to the following illustrative Experimental Examples.Experimental Example 1Samples a. Non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen obtained by isolation arid purification from a non A, non B hepatitis autopsy liver and having the aforementioned physicochemical properties also used in Experimental Examples 2 and 3 Convalescent phase serum from non A, non B hepatitis patent c. Supernatant homogenate of a non A, non B hepatitis autopsy liver d. Supernatant homogenate of normal human liver e. Normal human serum f.Antibodies of the present invention obtained in Example 1 obtained by subjecting immune antiserum of a test rabbit to IgG purification fractionation Method 0.8 W V of agarose A 45 Nakarai Kagaku , 0.02M of EDTA 3Na, 0.1M of sodium chloride and 0.1 of NaN3 were dissolved in a Tris HCQ buffer 0.0lM, pH 7.5 and a 1.5 mm thick gel plate was prepared. The amounts given hereafter are W V , weight in volume concentration, unless noted otherwise. A detection test was carried out for each sample in accordance with the micro Ouchterlony s test.Results The results are shown in the attached drawing.Round zones a through f in the drawing represent the disposition areas in which the corresponding samples were spotted. In Figure 1, the precipitin line between b a completely fuses with the line between b c, and the precipitin line between a b completely fuses with the line between a f. In other words, a and c had immunologically the same antigen property with respect to b, and b and f had immunologically the same antibody specificity with respect to a. On the other hand, the normal human liver homogenate d and the normal human serum e did not show the cross reaction at all. As described above, the non A, non B hepatitis autopsy liver represents the liver of a human patient having a type of hepatitis originating from hepatitis virus es , but who is negative to both hepatitis type A diagnosis and hepatitis type B diagnosis, and who, therefore, is excluded from being infected with hepatitis types A and B. Accordingly, the antibody f of the present invention produced immunologically by use of the antigen from the non A, non B hepatitis autopsy liver, as in Example 1, showed a specific antigen antibody reaction with the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen a. It was thus found that the antibody could also be obtained from the serum of a patient convalescing from non A, non B hepatitis.Experimental Example 2Samples As the samples, the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen was diluted in seven dilution ratios as listed in the antigen dilution ratio column in the following Table 1. Three kinds of agarose gels for the SRID, having antibody contents of 0.6 , 1.0 and 1 4 , respectively, were also prepared by properly changing the dilution ratio described inExample 2.Method 5 pQ of each sample were added to the agarose gels, and the resulting test samples were left standing at room temperature. Twenty hours later, the diameters mm of the resulting precipitin rings were measured.Results The results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that quantitative determination of the non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen is possible using the reagent of the present invention in accordance with the SRID. Furthermore, when the antibody content in the agarose gel is lower than 1.0 , the stoichiometry of the determination can be improved so that smaller amounts of antigen can be detected.

Ring diameter could not be measured accurately, though a precipitin ring was observed diameter of 4.0 mm or below . The numerical values are the measured diameters mm of the rings.Experimental Example 3Samples a. Non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen b. Liver homogenate supernatant from non A, non B hepatitis patient c. Normal human liver homogenate supernatant Four kinds of antibody sensitized sheep erythrocytes were prepared by following the same procedures as described in Example 3 except that solutions were used which were prepared by diluting the purified IgG solution with a phosphate buffered saline solution so that the antibody dilution ratios became 1 10, 1 20, 1 40 and 1 80, respectively.Method 25 pQ of a phosphate buffered saline 0.15 M, pH 7.2,PBS containing 2 normal rabbit serum were dropped into micro titration plates V type and each sample was diluted with said PBS by 2n times in two series serial 2 fold dilution . 25 pt of a phosphate buffered saline 0.15 M, pH 7.2 containing 2 normal rabbit blood serum was added to the samples of one series while 25 VQ of the serum from non A, non B hepatitis patient containing the antibody of the present invention was added to the samples of the other series. After incubation at 37 Oc for 30 minutes, antibody sensitized sheep erythrocytes were added to each series. Then the plates were each subjected to further incubation at room temperature for 2 hours to confirm occurrence of agglutination.Samples were determined as positive whose agglutination value was 3 tubes or more dilution of 8 times or more on the buffer side and whose agglutination inhibition was confirmed for at least 2 tubes. The antigen titer was expressed as the highest dilution of the sample that showed hemagglutination.Results The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Antigen TiterAntibody Dilution Sample Ratio a b c 1 10 2,000 1,000 1 20 2,000 1,000 1 40 2,000 1,000 1 80 500 200 In this table, the symbol represents an agglutination value of two or below. It can be seen from Table 2 that the sensitivity of the agglutination reaction of the sheep erythrocytes sensitized by the antibody of the present invention was 50 to 100 times that of the MO methods and was extremely high. It can also be concluded that the specificity of an agglutinogen could be clearly confirmed from the existence of agglutination inhibition due to the serum from non A, non B hepatitis patient containing the antibody of the present invention. The present invention will be described in further detail with reference to the following examples of preparation of the antibody of the invention.Example 1 Freund s complete adjuvant was added in a ratio of 1 1 to a solution containing non A, non B hepatitis associated antigen obtained by isolation and purification from non A, non B hepatitis autopsy liver and having the aforementioned physicochemical properties, and an emulsion was formed. 0.5 mQ portions of the emulsion were injected into the back of a rabbit, subcutaneously and intracutaneously, and into the food pad of the rabbit. One week later, the equal volume of the emulsion was additionally injected for immunization.One month after the first immunization, a double quantity of the emulsion was further injected. One week after the last immunization, the blood of the rabbit was collected several times in order to separate the serum therefrom. The equal volume of a normal human liver homogenate supernatant was added to this anti serum, and the resulting mixture was left standing at 37 Oc for one hour, then at 4 c over night. The mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 minutes to collect a supernatant fraction containing the antibody of the invention. The antibody of the present invention was then stored in the form of an aqueous solution and was used in Example 2 below. Next, 50 mQ of the antibody of the present invention was dialyzed at 40C for one day and one night using a 0.01M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 as an external solution. Thereafter, DEAE cellulose equilibrated sufficiently with a 0.01M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 was packed in a chromatography column and the antibody of the present invention was added to the column, so that serum proteins other than y globulin would be adsorbed.Subsequently, the unadsorbed y globulin was eluted, recovered by the phosphate buffer 0.01M, pH 8.0 , and subjected toultra filterationusing a PM 10 membrane to adjust the protein concentration to abdut 1.0 mg mR. The resulting purified IgG material of the antibody of the present invention was used in Examples 3, 4 and 5 below. Example 2 Agarose was heat dissolved in a 0.01M Tris HCQ buffer of pH 7.5, containing 0.15M sodium chloride and 0.1 sodium azide, to obtain a 1.2 solution, and 80mb of this solution was cooled down to about 560C. The solution obtained in Example 1 was diluted by ten times and 20 mt of this diluted solution was added to the agarose solution and stirred in. The resulting mixed solution was charged into a plastic container and left standing, and subsequently cooled to form a lm thick agarose plate. A plurality of sample holes of 3mm diameter were bored in the plate at a predetermined distance from each other. The resulting plate had an antibody content of 2.08 and could be used as a detection reagent according to the SRID.Example 3 Sheep blood was placed in a centrifugal tube and centrifuged at 2,Q00 rpm for 10 minutes using a saline solution. Centrifugation was repeated five times to wash the erythrocytes. A phosphate buffered saline solution of pH 7.5 and 0.15 M was added to this erythrocyte suspension in a 5 concentration. A glutaraldehyde solution prepared in a 2.5 concentration, using the same phosphate buffered saline solution, was added to the erythrocyte suspension, at a volume ratio of siad glutaraldehyde to said erythrocyte suspention of 1 5.Then the mixed solution was reacted at room temperature for about 5 hours with stirring to fix the eryLhrocytes. The solution was then centrifuged to obtain the fixed erythrocytes, which were washed several times by centrufugation using a saline solution.The fixed erythrocytes were prepared in a 5 suspension using the 0.15 M phosphate buffered saline solution of pH 7.5. A tannic acid solution adjusted to 5 mg dQ using the same phosphate buffered saline solution was added in an equivalent quantity and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged to obtain the tanned and fixed erythrocytes, which were then washed several times by centrifugation using a saline solution. The phosphate buffered saline solution was added to the resulting tanned and fixed erythrocytes to form a 5 erythrocyte suspension. This erythrocyte suspension was mixed with the same quantity of a solution obtained by diluting the IgG purified material of Example 1 in a protein concentration of about 50 pg mQ antibody dilution ratio 1 20 with the phosphate buffered saline solution, and the mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for 60 minutes to sensitize the erythrocytes. The solution was centrifuged to obtain the sensitized erythrocytes, which were washed several times by centrifugation using a saline solution.A phosphate buffered saline solution containing 2 normal rabbit blood serum was added to the resulting sensitized erythrocytes to form a 7 suspension. The sensitized erythrocytes were used as a detection reagent according to the R PHA process.Example 4 The IgG purified material obtained in Example 1 was dissolved in a 0.05M phosphate buffered saline solution of pH 7.5 so as to adjust the protein concentration to 1 mg mQ. 50 VQ of one mCi 125I Na was added to 10 pi of this solution, and 10 pt of a solution obtained by dissolving chloramine T in the abovementioned phosphate buffered saline solution at a concentration of 1.5 mgSmt was further added.The mixed solution was stirred for 30 seconds, and 100 pQ of a solution obtained by dissolving sodium metabisulfite in the abovementioned phosphate buffered saline solution at a ratio of 2 mg mt was added to the solution to stop the reaction. 100 l of a solution obtained by dissolving potassium iodide in the abovementioned phosphate buffered saline at a concentration of 10 mgJmt was added to this 125 reaction solution and an I labelled substance was 125 immediately separated from 125I by gel filtration with Sephadex G 50. The specific activity of the resulting 1251 labelled substance was about 5 to 20 pCi ug. This 125I labelled substance was used as a detection reagent according to the RIA process.Example 5 The IgG purified material obtained in Example 1 was concentrated to 5 to 10 mg mt in a 0.05M phosphate buffered saline solution and alkali phosphatase 5 mg mt was added in the proportion of 0.3 mg to 0.1 0.2 mt of the concentrate. Next, 50 pt of 2.5 glutaraldehyde was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The solution was dialyzed over night with a 0.05M Tris HCt buffer pH 8.0 and then centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant substance was used as a detection reagent according to the EIA using the enzyme linked antibody.
