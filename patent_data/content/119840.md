# Preparation of carbonates.

## Abstract
Alkylene carbonates and optionally dialkyl carbonates are prepared by reaction of an alkylene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of an alcohol. In addition there is added to the reaction mixture a trivalent phosphorus containing compound as catalyst. In an embodiment, the alkylene carbonate is further transesterified with the alcohol to produce a dialkyl carbonate and an alkylene glycol.

## Description
PREPARATION OF CARBONATES This invention relates to a process for the preparation of carbonate esters, more particularly to the preparation of alkylene carbonates and optionally dialkyl carbonates by the reaction of carbon dioxide with an alkylene oxide in the presence of an alcohol. The reaction of an alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a tertiary phosphine as catalyst to form an alkylene carbonate has been previously reported inJapanese Patent No 73 22 702 Chemical Abstracts 1973, Vol 79 at page 284 . Further, the reaction of an alkylene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of, as catalyst, a mixture of a protic substance such as water or an alcohol and a nitrogenous base such as triethylamine, to form an alkylene carbonate has been described inUK Patent No 1,485,925. It has now been found that the reaction between carbon dioxide and an alkylene oxide can be effected in the presence of an alcohol using as catalyst a trivalent phosphorus containing compound and that the reaction is very much faster than that described in the above Japanese patent where the alcohol is absent. According to the present invention a process for the preparation of alkylene carbonates and optionally dialkyl carbonates comprises reacting an alkylene oxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of an alcohol and, as catalyst, a trivalent phosphorus containing compound. The trivalent phosphorus containing compound can be a tertiary phosphine e.g. a trialkyl or a triaryl phosphine and may contain more than one trivalent phosphorus atom. Suitable phosphines are of formula R1 R2 P R3 where R1, R2 and R3, which can be the same or different, are hydrogen, or substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl, aryl, alkaryl, or aralkyl groups. Also one or more of the RI, R2 and R3 groups can contain a tertiary phosphorus atom. Insoluble or heterogenised phosphines can also be used. Preferred phosphines of this type are those where the phosphine is bonded to a polymeric backbone by means of one or more of the groups R1, R2 and R3. The alcohol can be a primary aliphatic alcohol, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol or polyols such as ethylene or propylene glycol. Conveniently the amount of alcohol is at least the molar equivalent of the phosphine, and is preferably sufficient to dissolve substantially all the reactants. The alkylene oxide used is conveniently a 1,2 alkylene oxide.Preferred examples of such alkylene oxides are ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and 1,2 butylene oxide. Preferably the reaction is effected under the following conditions temperature from 60 to 150 C pressure in excess of 5 bars According to another aspect of the present invention a process for the transesterification of an alkylene carbonate comprises reacting the alkylene carbonate prepared as hereinbefore described with an alcohol under transesterification conditions to form an alkylene glycol and a carbonate ester of the alcohol. Suitable catalysts for the transesterification reaction are those employed for the reaction of the carbon dioxide with the alkylene oxide to form the alkylene carbonate. One way in which the reaction can be performed is to first react the carbon dioxide with the alkylene oxide to form the alkylene carbonate in the presence of for example an approximately stoichiometric amount of the alcohol and to continue the reaction to effect the transesterification. The invention is illustrated by the following examples in which the reactants and products except the carbon dioxide were predominantly in the liquid phase.Example 1 Preparation of propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate A 100 ml high pressure stirred autoclave was charged with 15 g of propene oxide, 15 g of methanol, and 1.5 g of triphenylphosphine. The autoclave was sealed and flushed twice with carbon dioxide, following which it was pressurised to 21 bar with carbon dioxide and finally heated to 130 C with stirring 1200 rpm . After 3 h, the autoclave was cooled to 50C. Analysis of the liquid product by gas chromatography showed a propene oxide conversion of 89 to propylene carbonate and a 8 conversion of methanol to dimethyl carbonate.Example 2 Preparation of propylene carbonate Example 1 was repeated except that 15 g of ethanol was used in place of methanol. Analysis of the liquid product showed a propene oxide conversion of 88 with a selectivity to propylene carbonate of 98 .Example 3 Preparation of butylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate Example 1 was repeated except that 15 g of butene oxide was used in place of propene oxide. Analysis of the liquid product showed a butene oxide conversion of 87 with selectivities to butylene carbonate and glycol of 86 and 6 respectively and a 5 conversion of methanol to dimethyl carbonate .Example 4 Preparation of propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate Example 1 was repeated except that the reaction time was increased to 6 h. Analysis of the liquid product showed a quantitative conversion of propene oxide with selectivities to propylene carbonate and glycol of 72 and 19 respectively and an 18 conversion of methanol to dimethyl carbonate . Example 5 Preparation of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate Example 1 was repeated except that 15 g of ethylene oxide was used in place of propene oxide. Analysis of the liquid product showed a quantitative conversion of ethylene oxide with selectivities to ethylene carbonate and ethylene glycol of 64 and 29 respectively and a 33 conversion of methanol to dimethyl carbonate .Example 6 Preparation of propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate Example 1 was repeated except that 2.3 g of bis diphenylphosphino ethane was used as a catalyst in place of triphenylphosphine. Analysis of the liquid product showed a quantitative conversion of propene oxide with selectivities to propylene carbonate and glycol of 76 and 18 respectively and a 15 conversion of methanol to dimethyl carbonate .Example 7 Preparation of propylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate Example 1 was repeated except that 1.2 g of tri n butyl phosphine was used as a catalyst in place of triphenyl phosphine. Analysis of the liquid product showed a quantitative conversion of propene oxide with selectivities to propylene carbonate and glycol of 71 and 18Z respectively and a 16 conversion of methanol to dimethyl carbonate . Comparative Test A Example 1 was repeated in the absence of the methanol and using 30 g of propene oxide. Analysis of the liquid product showed a propene oxide conversion of 7 to propylene carbonate. This test illustrates that the reaction carried out in the absence of methanol gives only a very low conversion of propene oxide 7X as compared with 89 according to the present invention.Comparative Test B Example 1 was repeated in the absence of triphenylphosphine.Analysis of the liquid product showed a propene oxide conversion of less than 1 to propylene carbonate. The above described invention has the following advantage As compared with amines, phosphines have a lower volatility and hence losses in use are smaller.
