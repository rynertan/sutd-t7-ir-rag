# Heat pipe.

## Abstract
An improved heat pipe 10 comprising a duct 11 having disposed at opposite ends thereof an evaporator 12 with wicklined hollow fins 14 in the form of extended cor rugations thereon, and operable to supply heat to the evap orator comprised of a gas combusto having an internal volume for containing the evaporator and combustion air for supply to a combustion chamber located therein a wick 18 capable of transporting liquid by capillary action lining sub stantially all internal surfaces of said heat pipe an external heat sink operable to remove heat from the condenser 13 and a heat transport medium contained by said heat pipe. The evaporator is further comprised of a coarse porous material 19 lining and completely filling the spaces within the hollow fins open to the evaporator for increased struc tural stiffness and ease of fabrication and a porous mass 20 completely filling the evaporator for increased com pressive strength. The coarse porous material and the po rous mass are sufficiently porous to allow vapor to flow through each with a minimum of obstruction.
