# Improvements in or relating to tobacco smoke filters.

## Abstract
Ventilation into a cavity 30 in a cigarette filter 20 is controlled, in one embodiment, by a spring loaded piston 40 slidable within the cavity 30 and arranged to cover or uncover ventilating apertures 34 in the wall 28 of the cavity 30 . In a second embodiment control over the ventilation is achieved by flap valves integral with the wall of the cavity and adapted to cover or uncover the ventilating apertures in the wall of the cavity.
