# Signal transmission systems.

## Abstract
This is a signal transmission system including an analogue multiplexer 11, a switched gain amplifier 15, a mode amplifier 17, a sample and hold stage 19, and an analogue to digital converter 22. Off set errors can be precalculated and then corrected for by switching the input to the amplifiers 15 and 17 to null, and storing the output from the converter 22, and the amplified output from the amplifier 15 respectively at X and Y and then combining those stored off set error signals at 46 at the input to the converter 22 during a subsequent analogue to digital conversion.
