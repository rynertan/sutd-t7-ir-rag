# Method of improving the processability of rigid polymers melts, solutions and shaped articles prepared according to this method.

## Abstract
A method of improving the processability of rigid polymers, particularly of unprocessable rigid polymers, wherein the rigid polymer in melt or solution form is subjected to an apparent shear rate between relatively moving surfaces of at least 100 sec ยน, particularly between 100 to 1000 sec ยน. The method reduces the viscosity of the melt or solution and when the melt or solution is fabricated into shaped articles whilst the viscosity is so reduced the shaped articles have improved properties, particularly more uniform orientation when compared with products prepared by methods which do not include the pre shearing step prior to fabrication.
