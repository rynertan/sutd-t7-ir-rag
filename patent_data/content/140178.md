# DC DC converter.

## Abstract
The DC DC converter comprises a feedback type voltage converter 16 for converting a DC input voltage to provide an output as the output of the DC DC converter and output voltage control circuit 17 including constant current supply means 171, 172, 174, 175 coupled to the output of the voltage converter 16 , voltage picking up means 173 connected to the output of the constant current supply means 171, 172, 174, 175 , and feedback means 176 for feeding back the voltage sensed by the voltage picking up means 173 to the feedback input end 15 of the feedback type voltage converter 16 . This DC DC converter has a high conversion efficiency and a stable output voltage and facilitates the temperature compensation.
