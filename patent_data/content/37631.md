## Description
FRICTION REDUCING ADDITIVES AND COMPOSITIONS THEREOF This invention relates to lubricant additives and compositions thereof and, more particularly, to lubricant compositions comprising oils of lubricating viscosity or greases prepared therefrom containing a minor friction reducing amount of a borated sorbitan ester. Many means have been employed to reduce overall friction in modern engines, particularly automobile engines. The primary reasons are to reduce engine wear thereby prolonging engine life and to reduce the amount of fuel consumed by the engine thereby reducing the engine S energy requirements or fuel consumption. Many of the solutions to reducing fuel consumption have been strictly mechanical, as for example, setting the engines for a leaner burn or building smaller cars and smaller engines. However, considerable work has been done with lubricating oils, mineral and synthetic, to enhance their friction properties by modifying them with friction reducing additives. Hydroxyesters are known for their friction reducing properties when added to lubricant fluids.However, these hydroxyesters have not found widespread use in many applications because of their inherent inability to control bearing corrosion it is believed that the poor control of bearing corrosivity of these hydroxyesters is due to the presence of reactive hydroxyl groups. The use of borated hydroxyesters as friction reducing additives is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,544,614 which discloses the use of sorbitol esters, a linear molecule, having the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R is an organic group. We have now found that when borated, sorbitan esters, cyclic molecules the predominant form of which has the general formula EMI2.2 wherein R is a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon group having from 10 to 30 carbon atoms, possess excellent friction reducing properties and reduce bearing corrosion to minimal, acceptable levels. Borated sorbitan esters are better friction reducers than their unborated counterparts and also reduce bearing corrosion to minimal, acceptable levels. It is believed that the conversion of hydroxyl groups to borate esters groups leads to these multiple performance improvements. This invention is directed to borated sorbitan esters. In addition to these novel compounds, the invention is also directed to lubricant compositions having reduced friction containing such compounds and to a method of reducing fuel consumption in internal combustion engines by treating the moving surfaces thereof with said compositions. Further these compounds also possess significant antioxidant characteristics and bearing corrosion inhibiting properties. It is not necessary to use high purity sorbitan esters to effect these product quality improvements good results are obtained using commercially available mixtures of sorbitan monoesters and sorbitan diesters. Boration of such sorbitan esters is readily accomplished.The level of boration may be varied, i.e., the sorbitan esters can be partially or extensively borated to yield products containing as little as 0.01 percent boron. The greater levels of boration, however, impart enhanced properties. The sorbitan esters may be obtained commercially as stated hereinabove or prepared in any convenient manner known to the art. The sorbitan esters useful in this invention include mono , di and triesters. Accordingly these esters will have at least one aliphatic or hydrocarbyl group attached thereto. The length of this group can vary from about 10 to about 30 carbon atoms.Representative ester groups are such as laurate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, phenyl stearate and the like. The borated derivatives may be produced by any means known In the art, e.g., by direct treatment of the sorbitan ester with boric acid or by transesterification with a trialkyl borate. The reactions are usually carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent or solvents, at temperatures ranging from about 900C to about 260 C. The solvents can be hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene or xylene, or reactive solvents such as butanol. Specific reaction conditions and molar equivalents of the reactants, well known in the art, determine the nature of the final borated product. The amount of additive in accordance with the present invention required to be effective in lubricant compositions may range from 0.1 to percent by weight of the total lubricant composition. Preferred is from 0.5 to 5 wt. percent. The non metallic compositions thus provided are effective at said moderate to low concentrations and do not contain any potentially undesirable phosphorous, sulfur or metallic salts. The described additives are suitable for use in a variety of functional fluids such as transmission fluids and hydraulic fluids, etc. The lubricants contemplated for use herein include both mineral and synthetic hydrocarbon oils of lubricating viscosity, mixtures of mineral and synthetic oils, and greases or other solid lubricants prepared therefrom. The synthetic hydrocarbon oils include long chain alkanes such as cetanes and olefin polymers such as trimers and tetramers of long chain a oleflns. These synthetic oils can be mixed with other synthetic oils which include 1 ester oils such as pentaerythritol esters of monocarboxylic acids having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, 2 polyglycol ethers, 3 polyacetals and 4 sjloxane fluids. Especially useful among the synthetic esters are those made from polycarboxylic acids and monohydric alcohols.More preferred are the ester fluids made from pentaerythritol, and an aliphatic monocarboxylic acid containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or mixtures of such acids. EXAMPLE 1 Borated Sorbitan Monooleate l SMO 1 H3B03 A mixture of commercially obtained sorbitan monooleate and sorbitan dioleate 1350 g , boric acid 195 g , and n butanol 700 g was refluxed at 100 to 1420C until the theoretical amount of water, relative to the amount of boric acid charged, formed in the reaction had azeotroped over. The solvent was removed by vacuum distillation yielding a light brown, fluid product. EXAMPLE 2 Borated Sorbitan Monooleate 1 SMO 1 2 3H3B03 A mixture of commercially obtained sorbitan monooleate and sorbitan dioleate 1350 g , boric acid 323 g , and n butanol 1002 g was refluxed at 100 to 1600C until no more water would azeotrope over. Approximately 94 percent of the theoretical amount of water, based on the amount of boric acid charged, was recovered. The solvent was removed by vacuum distillation yielding a light brown fluid product. EXAMPLE 3 Borated Sorbitan Monolaurate A mixture of commercially obtained sorbitan monolaurate and sorbitan dilaurate 2000 g , boric acid 778 g , and toluene was refluxed with agitation at 100 to 1400C until no more water azeotroped over. Approximately 47 percent of the theoretical amount of water, based on the amount of boric acid charged, was obtained. The solvent was removed and the residue was filtered yielding a dark brown viscous product. The additives prepared as above were then incorporated into a fully formulated 5W 20 engine oil and evaluated using the Low Velocity Friction Apparatus.Selected additives were also evaluated in the DoubleLength CRC L 38 Bearing Corrosion Test. Low Velocity Friction Apparatus LVFA The Low Velocity Friction Apparatus LVFA is used to measure the friction of test lubricants under various loads, temperatures, and sliding speeds. The LVFA consists of a flat SAE 1020 steel surface having a diameter of 3.8 cm 1.5 in. which is attached to a drive shaft and rotated over a stationary, raised, narrow ringedSAE 1020 steel surface having a surface area of 50 mm2 0.08 2 Both surfaces are submerged in the test lubricant. Friction between the steel surfaces is measured as a function of the sliding speed at a lubricant temperature of 1200C 250oF . The friction between the rubbing surfaces is measured using a torque arm strain gauge system.The strain gauge output, which is calibrated to be equal to the coefficient of friction, is fed to the Y axis of an X Y plotter. The speed signal from the tachometer generator is fed to the X axis. To minimize external friction, the piston is supported by an air bearing. The normal force loading the rubbing surfaces is regulated by air pressure on the bottom of the piston. The drive system consists of an infinitely variable speed hydraulic transmission driven by a 400 W output 1 2 HP electric motor. To vary the sliding speed, the output speed of the transmission is regulated by a levercam motor arrangement.Procedure The rubbing surfaces and 12 13 ml. of test lubricant are placed on the LYFA. A 3400 kPa 500 psi load is applied, and the sliding speed is maintained at 9m min. 40 fpm at ambient temperature for a few minutes. A plot of coefficients of friction Uk over a range of sliding speeds, 1.5 to 12 m min. 5 to 40 fpm, 25 195 rpm , is obtained. A minimum of three measurements is obtained for each test lubricant. Then, the test lubricant and specimens are heated to 1200C 250oF , another set of measurements is obtained, and the system is run for 50 minutes at 1200C 250oF , 3400 kPa 500 psi , and 12 m min. 40 fpm sliding speed. Freshly polished steel specimens are used for each run. The surface of the steel is parallel ground to 100 to 200 nm 6 to 8 microinches .The percentages by weight are percentages by weight of the total lubricating oil composition, including the usual additive package. The data are percent decrease in friction according to Uk Of oil alone U of Additive plus oil x 100 Uk of oil alone Thus, the value for the oil alone would be zero for the form of the data disclosed in the Table below.

From the data of the Table it is readily apparent that the subject borated additives significantly improve the friction reducing properties of lubricants and the borated sorbitan esters of the present invention are more efficient friction reducers than their non borated counterparts while concomitantly increasing fuel economy. The use of additive quantities as low as 1 or 2 percent of the borated sorbitan esters results in effective reductions of friction when blended into fully formulated automotive engine oils. In addition to being useful at low concentrations, these compositions do not contain any potentially undesirable phosphorous, sulfur or metallic salts, but additionally exhibit good oxidation and bearing corrosion inhibiting properties. It should be noted that non borated polyhydroxyesters similar to the borated additives of the invention see the Table routinely fail even a single length 40 hr.
