# Integrated circuit comprising capacitances of different capacitance values.

## Abstract
An integrated circuit comprising capacitances of diffe rent capacitance values, this circuit comprising rows of basic capacitances 31, 33, 32 , while the said capacitances have different numbers of basic capacitances connected in parallel between a first connection electrode 34 and an associated second connection electrode 35 . Plural rows have the same number of n basic capacitances and in different ones of these rows different numbers of basic capacitances form part of the said capacitances, all the remaining basic capacitances of the relevant rows being dummy capacitances. The second capacitance electrodes 32 are connected to one or more further connection electrodes 37 .
