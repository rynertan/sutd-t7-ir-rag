# IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS

## Abstract
A single or multi layer circuit board is formed by printing directly onto an electrically non conductive medium using a metal based fluid which, upon drying, leaves behind a solid metallic residue defining a predetermined circuit configura tion. For multi layer boards a plurality of conductive and non conductive layers are printed alternately onto a non conductive substrate or onto a conductive substrate pro vided with a non conductive surface.
