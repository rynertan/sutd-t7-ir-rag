The reaction mixture was heated at 70 C for 10 minutes to deactivate the enzyme, then, with addition of 1 10 vol. 500 mM NaCl and 10 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase c.i.a.p. , digestion was carried out at 37 C for 60 minutes. To each of the reaction mixtures of the donor DNA and the plasmid DNA was added an equal volume of a phenol solution saturated with a TESH buffer 0.2 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl , which step was followed by shaking for one minute, and the two mixtures were combined. After the combined mixture was centrifuged at 10,000xg 5 min., the upper layer aqueous layer was taken out with a Pasteur pipette. The aqueous layer portion containing DNA was subjected to ethyl ether extraction to remove phenol, and an equal volume of ethanol was added. After the mixture was left to stand at 80 C for 2 hours, DNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000xg 5 min. The DNA thus obtained was washed with 500 µl of ethanol, dried under reduced pressure, and dissolved in 50 µl of heat sterilized pure water. The DNA was subjected to heat treatment at 70 C for 10 minutes, then cooled gradually to room temperature and inoculated with addition of 5 µl of a buffer 0.66 M Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 66 mM MgCl₂, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 10 mM ATP and 5 µl 1 unit of T4 ligase at 22 C for 2 hours to prepare a recombinant DNA of pIJ702 and the Transformation of the host microorganism More specifically, A mixture of 100 µl of the protoplast suspension, 100 µl of a P maleic acid buffer adjusted to 3 2 concentration 2.5 sucrose, 1.4 mM K₂SO₄, 1 500 vol. trace elements solution, 100 mM CaCl₂, 50 ml Tris maleate pH 8.0 , 50 µl of the recombinant DNA solution and 375 µl of a polyethylene glycol solution polyethylene glycol 1000, 33 P maleate buffer was left to stand at room temperature for one minute then diluted with 5 ml of Ps medium, and the protoplasts were collected by centrifugation at 800xg 10 min. and suspended in 2 ml of Ps medium. After aliquots of the protoplast suspension each of 0.1 ml were applied onto RH agar media prepared in 20 circular plastic petri dishes of 9 cm in diameter containing, in one liter, sucrose 171 g, KCl 14.9 g, glucose 10 g, trace element solution 2 ml, 2.5 K₂SO₄ 10 ml, proline 3 g, casamino acid CAS 0.5 g, polypeptone 2 g, dextran 0.05 g, 0.5 KH₂PO₄ 10 ml, 1M CaCl₂ 2H₂O 50 ml, 0.25M TES pH 7.2 100 ml, CSL 30g 1000 ml 100 ml, 5 aspartic acid 10 ml , 2 ml of RH medium with an agar concentration of 0.5 was overlaid as the upper layer.

The reaction mixture was heated at 70 C for 10 minutes to deactivate the enzyme, then, with addition of 1 10 vol. 500 mM NaCl and 10 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase c.i.a.p. , incubation was carried out at 37 C for 60 minutes. To each of the reaction mixtures of the donor DNA and the plasmid DNA was added an equal volume of a phenol solution saturated with a TESH buffer 0.2 M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl , which step was followed by shaking for one minute, and the two mixtures were combined. After the combined mixture was centrifuged at 10,000xg 5 min., the upper layer aqueous layer was taken out with a Pasteur pipette. The aqueous layer portion containing DNA was subjected to ethyl ether extraction of remove phenol, and an equal volume of ethanol was added. After the mixture was left to stand at 80 C for 2 hours, DNA was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000xg 5 min. The DNA thus obtained was washed with 500 µl of ethanol, dried under reduced pressure and dissolved in 50 µl of heat sterilized pure water. The DNA was subjected to heat treatment at 70 C for 10 minutes, then cooled gradually to room temperature and incubated with addition of 5 µl of a buffer 0.66 M Tris HCl, pH 7.6, 66 mM MgCl₂, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, 10 mM ATP and 5 µl 1 unit of T4 ligase at 22 C for 2 hours to prepare a recombinant DNA of pIJ702 and the Transformation of the host microorganism More specifically, A mixture of 100 µl of the protoplast suspension, 100 µl of a P maleic acid buffer adjusted to 3 2 concentration 2.5 sucrose, 1.4 mM K₂SO₄, 1 500 vol. trace elements solution, 100 mM CaCl₂, 50 ml Tris maleic acid pH 8.0 , 50 µl of the recombinant DNA solution and 375 µl of a polyethylene glycol solution polyethylene glycol 1000, 33 P maleic acid buffer was left standing at room temperature for one minute then diluted with 5 ml of Ps medium, and the protoplasts were collected by centrifugation at 800xg 10 min. and suspended in 2 ml of Ps medium. After aliquots of the protoplast suspension each of 0.1 ml were coated onto RH agar media prepared in 20 circular plastic petri dishes of 90 cm in diameter containing, in one liter, sucrose 171 g, KCl 14.9 g, glucose 10 g, trace element solution 2 ml, 2.5 K₂SO₄ 10 ml, proline 3 g, casamino acid 0.5 g, polypeptone 2 g, dextran 0.05 g, 0.5 KH₂PO₄ 10 ml, 1M CaCl₂ 2H₂O 50 ml, 0.25M TES pH 7.2 100 ml, CSC 30g 1000 ml 100 ml, 5 aspartic acid 10 ml , 2 ml of RH medium with an agar concentration of 0.5 was overlaid as the upper layer. On this layer, after cultivation at 28 C for 18 hours, was further overlaid 2 ml of the same RH soft agar 0.5 with thiostrepton added to 20 µg ml. This was continued to be cultured at 28 C, in a chamber maintained at a humidity of 90 , for 10 to 20 days. The microorganism on the RH agar medium regenerated from protoplasts was transferred onto a nutrient agar medium containing 1 CAS, 5 µg ml CuSO₄ 5H₂O and 0.5 mg ml thyrosine by means of a commercially available needle. This was subjected to culturing at 28 C for 2 days. As a result, colonies producing melanine dyes and colonies producing no melanine dye were formed in a ratio of about 1 1. Since Of these, the colonies producing no melanine dye was replicated onto an agar piece having a composition as shown below by use of a commercially available tooth pick. Agar piece is a column of agar of 7 to 8 mm in diameter and 4 5 mm in height punched out with a cork borer from a composition comprising 0.4 glucose, 0.35 wheat germ, 0.23 SVP soluble vegetable protein , 0.03 KH₂PO₄, 0.0001 CoCl₂ 6H₂O, 2 agar, pH 7.0. The agar piece was subjected to cultivation at 28 C for 6 days. This was examined as to whether or not it was an agar piece forming an inhibitory circle at 32 C with the use of The one strain of As to whether these microorganism strains produced Bialaphos or not, analysis was performed according to the method as disclosed in a Literature Annual Research Report by Meiji Seika No.21, 44 51, 1982 . Briefly, the filtrate of each microorganism strain culture broth was analyzed with an amino acid analyzer and the antimicrobial substance produced in the medium could be identified chromatographically as Bialaphos.
