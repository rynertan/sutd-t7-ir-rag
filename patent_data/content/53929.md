# MOBILE CRUSHER VEHICLE AND METHOD OF CRUSHING

## Abstract
A mobile vehicle for crushing scrap metal, especially for flattening car body shells, has a crusher jaw mechanism 11 carried ahead of a generally conventional vehicle body 12 . The jaw includes a press plate 55 above a platform 31 . The car body shell 90 is loaded on to the platform by advancing the vehicle towards the body shell and driving the platform under the shell, and is then crushed between the press plate and the platform. The jaw mechanism may be carried on an arm or arms 13 which can be raised and lowered. Side plates 32 and a rear gate 80 may be provided on the crusher jaw mechanism to contain light scrap. The jaws may be tiltable, and may be provided with front fork tines 71 to act as an entry ramp and for manipulating the body shells before and after flattening.
