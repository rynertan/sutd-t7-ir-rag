# Filamentary resin compositions and methods for making such compositions.

## Abstract
A new composition of matter comprises the product of the amassment of two or more arrays of glass roving or other suitable filaments, each of which array has been coated or impregnated with one of two complementary resin systems, preferably thermosetting polyester resin systems. Each such complementary resin system comprises resin a curing agent, differing from the curing agent in the other resin system, and a suitable accelerator which is substantial ly ineffective to promote the curing agent of the resin system in which it is incorporated, but which does effectively promote the curing agent of the other, complementary resin system. Upon amassment of the separate arrays the two accelerators act synergisticly in the combined resin system. The invention is applicable to filament winding techni ques and the like to provide extremely rapid curing even at room temperatures.
