## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONBERNINAMYCIN A AS A GROWTH PERMITTANTBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Berninamycin A is a known sulfur containing modified peptide antibiotic agent disclosed in U.S.Patent 3,689,639 issued 5 September 1972 to Bergy et al. Berninamycin A is isolated from the fermentation of a broth of Streptomyces bernensis Dietz sp. nov.The compound is disclosed as being particularly active in inhibiting the growth of Bacillus subtilis and thus controlling the growth of slime and corrosion in petroleum products caused by such bacterium.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is concerned with title use ofBerninamycin A as a growth permittant in monogastric meat producing animals, particularly chickens and swine, thus it is an object of this invention to describe such uses and it is a further object to describe the conditions and results obtained by the use of Berninamycin A on the growth of chickens. A further object is to describe the compositions containing Berninamycin A for such uses. Additional objects will become apparent from a reading of the following description.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Berninamycin A has been shown to be an effective growth permittant in monogastric meat producing animals, particularly chickens and swine.As a result when Berninamycin A is fed to such animals they are seen to have an increase in weight over that which would normally be expected, and in audition, the amount of feed required to produce a unit of weight gain is reduced when compared with unmedicated controls and also with positive controls fed other growth permitting agents. For example, when Berninamycin A is fed to chickens for nine days at a level of ten or 20 parts per million ppm in feed, the chickens are seen to have a relative weight gain increase of 24.4 and 27.98 respectively, when compared with chickens fed the unmedicated feed. In addition, the ratio of the feed intake to the weight gain is seen to be 16.0 and 16.6 respectively, indicating that the chickens fed Berninamycin A achieved their weight gain using at least 16 less feed. These data demonstrate a substantial growth permitting effect and indicate that Berninamycin A is a highly effective agent for growth permittancy in chickens. Furthermore, Berninamycin A is observed to have a very low level of absorption in the animal, thus tissue residues and withdrawal times for animals fed Berninamycin A medicated feeds should be minimal. When the Berninamycin A is used as a growth permitter in animals it can be administered as a component of the feed of the animals or may be dissolved or suspended in the drinking water. When the Berninamycin A is used as a component of animal feed it is first formulated as a feed supplement. In such feed supplementsBerninamycin A is present in relatively concentrated amounts intimately dispersed in an inert carrier or diluent. The feed supplement can be added directly to the feed or made into a premix by intermediate dilution or blending steps. By inert carrier is meant one that will not react with the Berninamycin A and one that may be administered safely to animals.Preferably the carrier is one that is or may be an ingredient of the animal feed ration. Typical carriers are diluents suitable for such compositions include for example, distillers dried grains, corn meal, citrus meal, fermentation residues and ground oyster shells, wheat shorts, molasses solubles, corn cob meal, edible bean mill feed soya grits, crushed limestone and the like. The antibiotic is intimately dispersed throughout the carrier by methods such as grinding, stirring, milling or tumbling. Compositions containing from about 5 to 50 by weight of the antibiotic are particular suitable as feed supplements. Examples of typical feed supplements containing Berninamycin A dispersed in a solid carrier are TABLE Lbs.Formulation A Berninamycin A 5 Wheat Standard Middling 95Formulation B Berninamycin A 50 Corn Distillers Grains 50These and similar feed supplements are prepared by uniformly mixing the antibiotic with the carrier. The feed supplement can be added directly to the feed or made into a premix by an intermediate dilution or blending step with an orally ingestible carrier. Compositions containing 0.03 to 5 by weight of the antibiotic are particularly suitable as premixes. These premixes are prepared by uniformly mixing the antibiotic with an orally ingestible carrier. Such supplements or premixes are added to the animal feed in an amount to give the finished feed the concentratiion of Berninamycin A desired for growth permittancy. In chickens Berninamycin A is fed a final concentration of between 1 and 100 ppm, preferably between 10 and 20 ppm of feed in order to achieve the desired growth permitting result. In the case of swine,Berninamycin A may be administered in the feed at similar levels. In the above discussion of this invention emphasis has been placed on solid compositions wherein the Berninamycin A is mixed with an edible carrier in a feed supplement in a so called premix or in the final feedstuff. This is the preferred method of administering the Berninamycin A. However, an alternate method is to dissolve or suspend theBerninamycin A in the drinking water of the animals.The quantity that may be suspended in the water without undue settling is limited. Emulsifiers or surface active agents may be employed for this letter purpose. It will be also understood by those skilled in this art that special feed supplment formulations and finished animal feeds containing Berninamycin A may also include vitamins, other antibiotics and growth promoting and permitting agents and other nutritional substances.
