# Apparatus for eliminating irradiation induced reduction in light transmittance of a transparent glas.

## Abstract
When a transparent glass 13 is exposed to X ray or γ ray irradiation, it becomes discolored and there is thus a reduction in light transmittance. The irradiation induced reduction in light transmittance of the transparent glass is restored by visible light radiation through at least one surface thereof during and after X ray or γ ray irradiation. Visible light radiation is emitted from light sources 12 which are positioned so as to optically face to the transparent glass and directed at the glass by reflectors 11.

## Description
DESCRIPTION APPARATUS FOR ELIMINATING IRRADIATION INDUCED REDUCTION IN LIGHT TRANSMITTANCE OF A TRANSPARENT GLASS The present invention relates to apparatus for restoring the light transmittance of a glass, such as a window glass through which radiation apparatus are observed, an optical lens of T.V. camera for monitoring radiation apparatus, or an irradiation shielding glass disposed in front of the TV camera, which transmittance has been reduced by X ray or y ray irradiationinduced discoloration. A serious problem encountered in the atomic energy field where nuclear test plants available for nuclear development activities or atomic power generators are used or in the radiotherapy field is that the human body must be protected from being exposed to X ray or y ray irradiation which has injurious effects on the human body. Therefore, whenever using an irradiation source, it is conventional that, in order to contain the irradiation source in a compartment, a partition wall of the compartment is provided with a transparent window glass which can sufficiently shield X ray or y ray irradiation,or a CRT is installed on which the inside of the compartment is displayed through a monitor TV camera in the compartment. Generally, the exposure of glass to X ray or 7 ray irradiation induces discoloration due to so called color center, becoming colored yellowish brown. In particular, lead glass which is suitable to shield irradiation shows a distinct tendency to become discolored. For the purpose of overcoming the disadvantage that the exposure of glass to X ray or 7 ray irradiation causes discoloration, it is well known to those skilled in the art to mix a small quantity of cerium dioxide in the composition of the glass for preventing its discoloration. However, since a cerium dioxidecontaining glass tends to absorb visible radiation having wavelengths close to that of ultraviolet radiation, a considerable reduction in light transmittance of the cerium dioxide containing glass is induced.For example, glass consisting of 44.3 wt silicon dioxide SiO , 2 45.7 wt lead oxide PbO , 4.4 wt potassium oxide K2O , 5.0 wt sodium oxide Na2O , 0.2 wt aluminium oxide A1203 , and 0.3 wt arsenic oxide As203 shows, when containing 0.2 by weight of cerium dioxide CeO2 , about a 17 reduction in spectral transmittance of light of 400 nm wavelength after passing through 200 mm of optical path through the glass. In order to prevent an observation window glass from becoming discolored, it is usual to provide a lead shutter in front of or around the irradiation source which is adapted to open only in case of necessity so as to minimize the exposure of the window glass to irradiation. However, this has the disadvantage that the lead shutter has to be thick to satisfactorily prevent the window glass from becoming discolored. Where a monitor TV camera is used, it is proposed for the purpose of preventing lens elements of the camera from becoming discolored either to provide an irradiation shield glass plate in front of or around the irradiation source, or to use lens elements made of cerium dioxide containing glasses. Notwithstanding the considerations above, the frequent exposure of the glasses to X ray or y ray irradiation induces a reduction in light transmittance thereof over a long period of time, and thus causes the window glass, the glass plate, and the lens elements to be unusable. According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for restoring the light transmittance of a transparent glass which is so positioned as to be exposed to X ray or y ray irradiation and whose transmittance has been reduced by discoloration as a result of irradiation, said apparatus being characterised by comprising light sources for emitting visible light radiation, said light sources being placeable in optically facing relation to said transparent glass at least one surface thereof through which said transparent glass is exposed to said visible light radiation and reflection means disposed behind said light sources for reflecting said visible light radiation from said light sources toward said at least one surface. Using a light source for emitting visible light radiation, the higher the visible light radiation density is, the greater is the recovery of the light transmittance in rate. Moreover, short wavelength visible light is significantly more effective in restoring the light transmittance. A halogen lamp, a xenon lamp or the like can be used as the light source. The apparatus according to the present invention can be so modified that a glass is exposed to visible light radiation while it is just exposed to X ray or 7 ray irradiation so as to be kept from becoming discolored. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which like parts are designated by like reference numerals. Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view showing a light source arrangement wherein a plurality of light sources are disposed around the observation window of a chamber Figure 2 is a diagrammatic front view showing the light source arrangement shown in Fig. 1 Figure 3 is a schematic illustration showing a light source arrangement wherein a plurality of light sources for emitting visible light radiation are disposed adjacent and along opposed lateral surfaces of a glass plate provided in front of a monitor TV camera to prevent the lens from being exposed to X ray or y ray irradiation Figure 4 is a schematic illustration showing a monitor TV camera having a light source for emitting visible light radiation to which the lens of the camera is exposed and Figure 5 is a schematic illustration of a modified embodiment similar to that shown in Fig. 4. In Figs. 1 and 2, set in an irradiation shielding wall forming a part of a chamber not shown accommodating an X ray or r ray irradiation source therein or in a partition wall disposed around an X ray or 7 ray irradiation source is an irradiation shield glass 3 through which observations are made the irradiation shielding wall is omitted in Figs. 1 and 2 to simplify the illustration . Arranged around the window glass 3 are a plurality of light sources 2 which emit visible light irradiation, which radiation enters into the window glass 3 through the lateral surfaces 3b thereof, partially directly and partially after reflection by mirrors 1 incorporated with the respective light sources 2. As seen in Fig. 2, the light sources 2 are arranged in double lines. The window glass 3 is set in a wall of shielding material such as concrete. A lead glass containing, for instance. 40 by weight of lead oxide is often used as the window glass 3.Depending on the densities of X ray or y ray irradiation, it may be preferable to set a plurality of window glasses one over another. When using a window glass consisting of 44. S of silicon dioxide SiO2 , 45.7 of lead oxide PbO , 4.4 wt of potassium oxide K2O , 5.0 wt of sodium oxide Na2O , 0.2 wt aluminium oxide Al203 1 and 0.3 wt of arsenic oxide As203 , a window glass having a size of 200 x 200 x 23 100 mm shows a reduction in spectral transmittance at the wavelength of 400 nm of 66.5 to 54.8 after exposure thereof to a total irradiation of 600Roentgens A by an X ray tube operating at 85 kvp. The window glass 3 whose spectral transmittance at 400 nm wavelength has been reduced to 54.aS is exposed through its lateral surfaces 3b to visible light radiation emitted from a large number of light sources 2, for instance 32 lamps, after reflection by the respective mirrors 1, with the result that a spectral transmittance approaching that of the original is regained in about ten hours. Although halogen lamps having a power of 150W are used in this embodiment7 various kinds of lamps can be selectively used. For example, xenon lamps which can emit comparatively a large quantity of visible light radiation at wavelengths shorter than about 580 nm will have a preferable effect causing the window glass to recover its transmittance.It has been confined experimentally with a window glass with a small quantity of cerium oxide CeO2 that the recovery of light transmittance is almost the same in rate as that described for the window glass considered in this embodiment. Various light source arrangements can be made within the scope of the present invention. For example, light sources with the respective reflecting mirrors incorporated therewith may be disposed in a linear or in double lines either around four lateral surfaces or along at least one of them. Where a large number of visible light sources are used, there is the risk that the window glass 3 will be caused by the raised temperature to be colored yellow and thus to decrease its light transmittance. To prevent this, the reflection mirrors 1 can be replaced with cold mirrors which permit infrared rays to pass therethrough, but reflect visible light, or infrared reflection filters can be placed between the light sources 3 and reflection mirrors 1. It may also be desirable to allow cooling water to flow through a space formed between two window glasses 3 and an additional plate glass.Cooling water can be replaced by a solution of thallium formic which in itself shows an irradiation shielding effect. The exposure of the window glass to visible light radiation will be improved by coating the lateral surfaces with an antireflection layer. It is possible to expose the window glass 3 to visible light radiation through the front surface 3a in place of the lateral surface 3b, which leads to the same effect as described for the latter, except that visibility through the window glass is reduced during the visible light irradiation. A window glass 3 with a curved surface or cylindrical surface shows the same effect as described for a window glass 3 with plane surfaces. Fig. 3 shows another embodiment wherein a visible light radiation source is built into a monitorTV camera, and provided opposite to the taking lens 6 which forms an image on a face plate 5 of a camera tube 4, is an irradiation shield glass plate 13 which is exposed through its lateral surface 13b to visible light radiation from visible light sources 12 with mirrors 11 incorporated. In conventional monitor TV cameras, while the outermost lens may be made of a cerium oxide containing glass in order to reduce the rate at which it goes yellow, the lens eventually goes yellow anyway, with prolonged exposure of it to powerful X ray or 7 ray irradiation and thus becomes unusable. The monitor TV camera shown in Fig. 3 can enable a clear image of the object to be observed on such a display screen as a CRT since the glass plate 3 in itself, which is exposed to visible light radiation1 is prevented from becoming discolored while it serves to shield the lens from becoming discolored, It is desirable to make the glass plate 3 of a lead glass containing 40 by weight of lead oxide PbO . Protection of the lens elements and the camera tube from X ray or y ray irradiation may be by application of such materials as lead around them. Although eight 150W halogen lamps are used in the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, various kinds and various kinds and various numbers of lamps may be employed. When a large number of lamps are used, it is desirable, for preventing the glass plate 3 from overheating to replace the reflection mirrors 11 with cold mirrors which permit infrared rays to pass therethrough, but reflect visible rays, in much the same way as described for the embodiment shown in Figswl and 2. Further, the glass plate may be exposed through its front surface 13a to visible radiation from a visible light source. In the case last mentioned, however, the irradiation with visible light should be discontinued to avoid unclear images being produced. Fig. 4 shows still another embodiment wherein a monitor TV camera is provided with a reflecting mirror 7 pivotable around a shaft 8, a visible light source 2a and a reflecting mirror la incorporated with the source 2a therein. The reflection mirror 7 is adapted to move into and out of a position where it can reflect visible light from the light source 2a toward the lens 6 at an angle of 450 and to thereby expose the lens 6 to visible light radiation. The mirror 7 is, when moved out of the position described above, positioned outside of the visual field of the TV camera. Although during the use thereof for observation the lens 6 of the camera is exposed to irradiation, and thus becomes discolored, the discolored lens can be exposed to visible light radiation by the mirror 7 between exposures of the lens to irradiation to clear the discolored glass plate.Thus exposed alternately to X ray or y ray irradiation and visible light radiation, the lens 6 is kept from becoming discolored and thus allows satisfactory image of the object to be observed on the face plate 5 of the camera tube 4. It may be desirable to provide a shutter between the lens 6 and the face plate 5 so as to intercept strong visible light radiation incident upon the face plate 5. Further, it is desirable to apply material such as lead around the lens 6 and the camera tube 4 in order to protect them from X ray or 7 ray irradiation. Fig. 5 shows a modification of the embodiment of Fig. 4. The modified embodiment is the same in arrangement and results as that of Fig. 4, except that the mirror 7 is positioned between the lens 6 and the face plate 5 of the camera tube 4. Certain changes may be made in the abovementioned embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention, and those skilled in the art may make still other changes according to the teaching of the disclosure. Therefore, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interrupted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.
