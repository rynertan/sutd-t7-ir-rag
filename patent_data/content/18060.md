# Electro optical colour imaging apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention provides an electro optical colour imaging apparatus preferably for printing out an image from a photoelectrophoretic suspension 1 , in which the exposing illumination 4 , for each pixel, is modulated by an individually addressable electro optical modulator 10 , the exposing illumination 4 providing light pulses of three different colours for exposing each pixel.
