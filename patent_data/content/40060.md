# COMPOSITIONS OF CURED EPICHLOROHYDRIN RUBBER AND NYLON

## Abstract
Compositions comprising blends of about 5 95 parts by weight of nylon and about 95 5 parts by weight of cured epihalohydrin rubber per 100 total parts by weight of nylon cured epichlorohydrin rubber exhibit a valuable combination of properties. Compositions comprising 55 or more parts by weight of nylon are thermoplastic compositions exhibiting improved impact resistance. Compositions comprising 45 or more parts by weight of cured epichlorohydrin rubber are elastomeric. When compositions containing high proportions of rubber are statically cured, for example in molds, thermo set compositions are obtained if such compositions are dynamically cured, i.e., if the blend is masticated while the rubber is cured, elastoplastic compositions, which exhibit elastomeric properties and yet are processable as thermo plastics, are obtained.
