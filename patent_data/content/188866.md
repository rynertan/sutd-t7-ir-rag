# MULTIPLE LOOP FEEDBACK SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A multiple loop feedback system arrangement as typically shown in the diagram which may be used to construct a con trol system, electronic amplifier or electronic regulator. The in put signal combiners G1 s and G2 s are selected to be either summing, summing inverting or differential and G3 s is se lected to be either inveting or noninverting so that the signal loop formed by G1 s , and G2 s has a net phase shift of zero degrees and the signal loop formed by G1 s , G3 s , B s and G2 s has a net phase shift of 180 degrees. By setting the gain of the zero phase shift loop to unity a balanced condition oc curs where the error signals generated in G3 s do not appear at the output Qo. Other embodiments of this invention include an arrangement where the input of G3 s is coupled to the out put of G2 s .
