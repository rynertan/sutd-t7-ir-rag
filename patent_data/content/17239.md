# Attaching device of a dial on stationary parts of a timepiece movement.

## Abstract
To attach the dial 1 to the timepiece movement 5 it is proposed to use a magnetic circuit comprising at least one permanent magnet 4 which cooperates with a soft ferro magnetic material 2 . The latter may be a component of the dial while the magnet is placed within the movement. The magnetic attraction which exists between both elements holds together the dial and the movement.
