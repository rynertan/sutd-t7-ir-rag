## Description
N SUBSTITUTED 5 SUBSTITUTED PHENYL 1,3 OXAZOLIDINES HERBICIDAL ANTIDOTES Field of the Invention This invention relates to a novel class of N substituted oxa zolidines useful as active herbicidal antidotes to protect against and decrease crop injury caused by thiocarbamate and aoetanilide herbicides.The oxazolidine ring of these antidotes is substituted at the 5 position with a phenyl group which is in turn substituted with one or more alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl groups or halogens. Other classes of haloacyl oxazolidine herbicide antidotes are known, but none with substituted phenyl groups at the 5 position of the oxazolidine ring. The following U.S. Patents disclose oxazolidine herbicide antidotes, however, none of such antidotes contain either a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group at the 5 position of the oxazolidine ring U.S. Patent Nos. 3,959,304 3,989,503 4,124,372 4,186,130 4,236,011 4,243,811 4,259,500 4,268,677 4,269,986 4,299,964 4,319,031 4,350,517 and 4,354,867. U.S. Patent Nods. 4,072,688 and 4,322,240 disclose haloacyl oxazolidine herbicidal antidotes wherein an unsubstituted phenyl group is a possible substituent at the 5 position of the oxazolidine ring, and a substituted phenyl is a possible substituent at the 2 position. U.S.Patent No. 4,249,931 discloses, among other oxazolidine antidotes, haloacyl oxazolidine antidotes wherein p chlorophenyl or p bro cpheny are possible substituents at the 2 position of the oxazolidine ring, whereas an alkoxy or alkylthio methyl group is a possible substituent at the 5 position. U.S. Patent 4,249,932 discloses, among other oxazolidine antidotes, 5 substituted 3 haloacyl oxazolidines, wherein phenoxymethyl is a substituent at the 5 position of the oxazolidine ring. Thus, none of the above patents disclose haloacyl oxazolidine antidotes wherein there is a substituted phenyl qroup at the 5 position. Backqround of the Invention An herbicide is a compound which adversely controls or modifies plant growth, e.g., killing, retarding, defoliating, desiccating, requlating, stunting, tillering, stimulating, and dwarfing. The term plant refers to all physical parts of a plant, includinq seeds, seedlings, saplings, roots, tubers, stems, stalks, foliage, and fruits. Plant growth includes all phases of development fran seed germination to natural or induced cessation of life. Herbicides are generally used to control or eradicate weed pests. bey have gained a high degree of canoercial success because it has been shown that such control can increase crop yield and reduce harvesting costs. Thiocarbamate and acetanilide herbicides are particularly effective in the control of grassy type weeds which interfere with the cultivation of a wide variety of crops, e.q., barley, corn, cotton, lentils, peanuts, peas, potatoes, soybeans, spinach, tobacco and tanatoes.Frequently the effective use of these herbicides requires the addition of an antidote compound to increase the tolerance of these compounds to the herbicides. The most popular methods of herbicide application include pre plant incorporation into the soil in furrrw application to seeds and surrounding soil prece surface treatment of seeded soilt and post emergence treatment of the plant and soil. A manufacturer of an herbicide generally rectnends a range of application rates and concentrations calculated to maximize weed control.The range of rates varies fran approximately 0.01 to 50 pounds per acre 0.0112 to 56 kilograns per hectare khla , and is usually in the range of fran 0.1 to 25 pounds per acre 0.112 to 28 k na . The term herbicidally effective amount describes the amount of an herbicide compound which controls or modifies plant growth. The actual amount used depends upon several considerations, including particular weed susceptibility and over all cost limitations. While many herbicides are irrinediately toxic to a larqe nunber of seed pests, it is known that the effect of many herbicides upon important plant cultivations is either non selective or not adequately selective. Thus, many herbicides damage not only the weeds to be controlled, but to a greater or lesser extent, the desirable cultivated plants as well. This holds true for many herbicidal compounds which have been comnercially successful and are commercially available. These herbicides include types such as triazines, urea derivatives, halogenated acetanilides carbamates, thiocarbamates, thiocarbamate sulfoxides, pyrrolidinones, and the like.Some examples of these cm pounds are described in U.S. Patent Nos.2,891,855, 2,913,237, 3,037,853, 3,175,897, 3,185,720, 3,198,786, 3,442,945, 3,582,314, 3,780,090, 3,952,056 4,110,105 and 3,257,190. The side effect of injury to a cultivated crop by various herbicides is particularly inconvenient and unfortunate. Acetanilide and thiocartamate herbicides can sometimes cause malformation and stunting of crop plants. This abnormal growth in the crop plant results in loss of crop yield. Previous attenpts are described to overcome this problem. The treatment of the crop seed with certain hormonal antagonistic agents to planting is described, see U.S. Patents 3,131,509 and 3,564,768. The protective agents, as well as the herbicide, in these prior processes are largely specific to certain cultivated plant species or in the nature of the antagonistic agents. The prior antagonistic agents have not been notably successful. The aforementioned patents specifically exemplify and describe the treatment of seeds employing ccsnpounds of a different chemical class not suggestive of the present invention. Other herbicidal antidotes are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,021,224 and 4,021,229. The precise mechanism by which an antidote reduces herbicidal crop injury has not been established. An antidote ccgnpound may be a remedy, interferent, protectant, or antagonist. As used herein, antidote describes a compound which has the effect of establishing herbicide selectivity, i.e., continued herbicidal phytotoxicity to weed species and reduced or non phytotoxicity to cultivated crop species. The term antidotally effective amount describes the amount of an antidote compound which counteracts a phytotoxic response of a beneficial crop to an herbicide. Description of the Invention It has now been discovered that N substituted 5 substituted phenyl 1 ,3xazolidines are effective antidotes for the protection of a variety of crops fran thiocarbamate and acetanilide herbicide injuries.Such antidotal effects as decreasing crop injury and increasinq crop tolerance to such herbicides are manifested when such herbicides and antidotes are applied in a variety of ways, for example, independently, or together in tank mixtures or in combination with other canpounds.

The ÀSSO 4E formulation contains about 48 active herbicide pound. The weight is measured in terms of mg of formulated herbicide. The flats measure 5.95 inches by 9.5 inches. Approximately four 4 mg flat is equal to one 1 lb acre. Solution applied using a linear spray table at a rate of 80 gallons acre. The herbicide was either incorporated into the soil prior to planting or applied to the soil after planting and prior to emergence of the plants. In some cases of pre plant incorporation, the herbicide was incorporated into the soil alone in preparation for in furrow application of the antidote in others the herbicide solution was tankmixed with the antidote solution prior to incorporation. These methods are abbreviated in the tables as follows PPI pre plant incorporation PPIeM pre plant incorporation in tank mix with the antidote and PBS pre emergence surface. Stock solutions of each antidote compound were prepared at the desired concentrations by diluting the requisite amounts of each antidote in acetone. The antidote solutions were applied to the soil either by infurrow surface application or by pre plant incorporation. In all cases of preplant incorporation, the antidote was tanksixed with the herbicide prior to incorporation into the soil. These methods are abbreviated in the tables as follows IF infurrow surface application of antidote andPPI TM pre plant incorporation of antidote, in tank mix with herbicide. For in furrow application, a one pint 473 cubic centimeter cc sample of soil containing the previously incorporated herbicide was removed and retained from each planting flat. After leveling and furrow ins the soil, seeds of the crop or weed species were planted l 2 inch deep 1.27 centimeter . Each flat was divided in half by a wooden barrier. A stock solution of the antidote was atomizeed directly onto the exposed seeds and soil in the open furrow on one side of the barrier. The seeds in the entire flat were then covered with the previously removed soil. The antidotally untreated sections of flats were compared for observed differences which muld indicate lateral movement of the antidote through the soil. Control flats contained crops treated with herbicide only. All flats were placed on greenhouse benches where temperature was maintained between 70 and 90 F 21.1 to 32.20C . The flats were watered by sprinklinq as needed to assure good plant growth. All of the soil used in the tests described herein was loamy sand soil treated with 50 parts per million ppm each of a comnercially available fungicide, N tridiloronethyl thio 4 cyclohexene l, 2 dicar boximide, and 17 17 17 fertilizer, which contains 17 by weight equivalent each of nitrogen, phosphorus pentoxide, and potassium oxide. Injury ratings were taken four weeks after application of the antidote. The effectiveness of the antidote was determined by visual com parison of crop injury which occurred in the test flats to that which occurred in the control flats. The treated crops initially screened for diminution of herbicidal injury were milo, wheat WHT , cotton COT , rice, barley BAR , corn and soybeans SOY . The compound was also tested on the following seeds watergrass XB Echinochloa crusgalli foxtail FT Stearia viridis wild oats WO Avena fatua and shattercane SC Sorqhum bicolor .

The first number is the percentage of injuries sustained by the indicated crop or seed species when treated by both the antidote and herbicide at the rates specified.The second number is the percentage of injuries sustained by the crop ar seed species when treated by the herbicide alone at the rate specified. Thus, the numbers represent Antidote treated Antidote untreated. An asterisk before the rating numbers in Table III indicates that the antidote is active in reducing herbicidal injury to the crop. A double asterisk after the number indicates that the rating was an average of two trials. All rates shown, for both herbicide and antidote, are in pounds Fer acre. Injury Ratings The injury to the crop Table III or weeds Table IV is shown as a percentage of damage done to the plants as Wared to an evaluation of the overall undamaged state of the plants indicated by check flats not treated with either herbicide or antidote. The damage done to the plants is a function of the nunber of plants injured and the extent of injury to each plant. mis rating is made four 4 weeks after application of the herbicide alone or of the herbicide in combination with the antidote. Table IV shows that the antidote compound has no effect on weeds, i.e., herbicidal injury to the weeds is sustained even in the presence of an antidote compound.

Use of the anti dote compounds, as indicated in Table IV, did not result in a reduction of herbicidal injury to weeds. Formulations 5 A formulation is the incorporation of a formulant in a form which is directly usable on crops and weeds. As defined herein, a formu lant is the material which is to be formulated. The formulant may be either an antidote compound alone or an herbicide and antidote conoosi tion. The purpose of the formulation is to apply the formulant to the locus where it is desired to establish herbicidal selectivity by a convenient method. The locus may include soil, seeds, seedlinqs and vegeta tion. The formulations are cannonly dusts, wettable powders, granules, solutions or emulsifiable concentrates. Dusts are free flowing powder compositions containinq the formulant impregnated on a particulate carrier. The particle size of the carriers is usually in the approximate range of 30 to 50 microns. Examples of suitable carriers are talc, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, and pyrophyllite. The composition generally contains up to 50 of formulant.Anti caking and anti static agents may also be added. Dusts may be applied by spraying from boom and hand sprayers on airplanes. Wettable powders are finely divided compositions canprisinq a particulate carrier impregnated with the formulant and additionally containing one or more surface active agents. The surface active anent promotes rapid dispersion of the powder in an aqueous medium to form stable, sprayable suspensions. A wide variety of surface active aqents can be used, for example, long chain fatty alcohols and alkali metal salts of the sulfated fatty alcohols salts of sulfonic acid esters of long chain fatty acids and polyhydric alcohols, in which the alcohol groups are free, cxnega substituted polyethylene glycols of relatively long chain length.A list of surface active agents suitable for use in aqriculture formulations can be found in Wade Van Valkenburg, Pesticide Formulations Marcel Dekker, Inc., N.Y., 1973 at pages 79 84. Granules comprise the formulant impregnated on a Particulate inert carrier having a particle size of about l to 2 millimeters nun in diameter. The granules can be made by spraying a solution of the formulant in a volatile solvent onto the granular carrier. Examples of suitable carriers for the preparation of granules include clay, vermiculite, sawdust, and granular carbon. Etnulsifiable concentrates consist of an oil solution of the formulant plus an emulsifying agent. Prior to use the concentrate is diluted with water to form a suspended emulsion of oil droplets. The emulsifiers used are usually a mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants. Other additives, such as suspending agents and thickeners, may be included in the emulsifiable concentrate. When the formulant is an antidote and herbicide composition, the proportion of antidote compound to herbicide compound generally ranges from approximately 0.001 to 30 parts by weight of the antidote compound per weight of the herbicide compound. Formulations generally contain several additives in addition to the formulant and carrier or agent. Prang these are inert ingredients, diluent carriers, organic solvents, water, oil and water, water in oil emulsions, carriers of dusts and granules, and surface active wetting, dispersing and emulsifying agents. Fertilizers, e.g., amnonium nitrate, urea and superphosphate, may be included. Aids to rooting and qrowth, e.g., compost, manure, humus and sand, may also be included. Alternatively, the antidote compounds and herbicide and antidote compositions of this invention can be applied to a crop by addition of the formulant to irrigation water supplied to the field to be treated. This method of application permits the penetration of the canes sitions into the soil as the water is absorbed. As another alternative, the formulant can be applied to the soil in the form of a solution in a suitable solvent. Solvents frequently used in these formulations include kerosene, fuel oil, xylene, petroleum fractions with boiling ranges above xylene and aromatic petroleun fractions rich in methylated naphthalenes. Liquid solutions, like dusts, may be applied by spraying fran boan and hand sprayers on airplanes.
