# IMPROVED JAR TOOL FOR DRILL STRINGS

## Abstract
A jar tool for use in a drill string for use in dislodging a drill bit or well tools trapped in well bores. The tool comprises an outer housing adapted to move longitudinally with respect to an inner spline mandrell. A piston assembly is acted on by a piston actuator and hydraulic fluid restricts the movement of the piston assembly and, therefore, the movement of the mandrell relative to the housing while the piston assembly is within a narrower portion of a hydraulic cylinder. When the piston assembly reaches a larger dia meter portion of the cylinder, the hydraulic fluid rushes past the piston assembly which allows a knocker connected to the spline mandrell to collide with the outer housing. A com pression spring returns the piston assembly to its rest position abutting a shoulder on the outer housing. Provision is made for a valve to be inserted in the piston assembly so that the system can be temperature compensated and more desirable hydraulic fluids can be used.
