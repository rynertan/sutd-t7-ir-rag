# Apparatus for introducing a process gas into a treatment chamber.

## Abstract
A process gas is introduced into a treatment chamber 40 through a horizontal spiral gas supply duct 30 having a tangential inlet 31 and opening to a pair of concentric, inner and outer annular gas inlet ducts 12,22 surrounding a liquid spray apparatus 2 . Partition means 32 divide the spiral supply duct 30 into independent inner and outer subducts 34,36 which define separate inner and outer flow passages 44,46 connected respectively to the inner and outer annular gas inlet ducts 12,22 . Damper means 70 is provided in the inlet to the outer sub duct 36 to selectively control the flow of process gas 7 therethrough as a means of maintaining the velocity of the flow of process gas 5 through the inner flow passage 44 above a minimum acceptable velocity.
