# Hinge structure for a sun visor or the like.

## Abstract
A shaft 24 which pivotally supports a sun visor is formed with flat surfaces 38 at longitudinally staggered positions and on opposite sides of the shaft 24 , a spring 30 is attached to the visor proper which has flat portions 40 for engaging the flat surfaces 38 so that a snap action is provided only when the visor is rotated into close proximity of a home position wherein the flat portions 40 of the spring clamp 30 down flatly on the flat surfaces 38 . When the visor is rotated away from this home position the distortion of the flat portions 40 of the spring 30 produces a reaction which induces sufficient friction between the shaft 24 and the spring 30 to hold the visor in any given select ed position.
