# Integrable large dynamic range photodetector element for linear and area integrated circuit imaging arrays.

## Abstract
An integrable photodetector element of large dynamic range includes a silicon substrate 11 which has a resistivity of between 1 and 100 ohm cm. The substrate is of one con ductivity type. In the substrate there is an electrically floating photosensitive diffusion region D1 and a second diffusion region D2 that is spaced apart from the electrically floating region by means of a channel length L in the substrate. The two diffusion regions are of the same conductivity type and of opposite conductivity type to that of the substrate. A metal insulator semiconductor gate G1 spans the substrate be tween the regions and over the channel. The gate is electri cally connected to the electrically floating region, and the second regions is reverse biased with respect to the sub strate. Except for the photosensitive diffusion region, the ele ment is shielded against penetration by visible light. The length L of the channel between the regions, the resistivity of the substrate, the magnitude of the reverse bias and the depth of the diffusion regions is selected so that the potential barrier between the electrically floating region and the chan nel is low enough that electrons which are photogenerated in response to visible light impinging on the electrically float ing region can be injected therefrom into the channel to be collected by the second diffusion region. As a result of this the voltage of the electrically floating region varies logarithm ically with changes in visible light incident thereon.
