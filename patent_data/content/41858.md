# Method and apparatus for deep level transient spectroscopy scanning.

## Abstract
A Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy DLTS method and apparatus, in which a high frequency measuring signal 10 is applied continuously on a semiconductor junction 13 , and exciting pulses are generated which are coupled through fast semiconductor switching elements 15 to the junction to alternately bias the junction in reverse and forward or slightly reverse directions. The high frequency measuring signal passed through the junction is evaluated by means of a lock in amplifier 24 . The evaluation circuits of the apparatus including the lock in amplifier are controlled by switching elements driven by control signals generated by a control unit 32 . The measuring time of the lock in amplifier is controlled to start after a dead time after the beginning of the reverse bias pulse, which dead time is a fixed portion of the period of the exciting pulses.
