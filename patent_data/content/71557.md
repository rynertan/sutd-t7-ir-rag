# Method and apparatus for generating a start of combustion signal for a compression ignition engine.

## Abstract
The method and apparatus for generating start of combustion signals associated with the combustion events in a diesel engine 10 , and for using such signals to control the timing of fuel delivery to the engine. The combustion event is sensed, as by an electrostatic 230, 330 or optical 130, 430 sensor, and signal conditioning circuitry 32 provides a start of combustion SOC signal 34 which is directly and precisely indicative of the time of the onset of combustion. The sensors 130, 230 include self cleaning capabilities 48, 248 for extended operating life on an engine. The sensors may be incorporated in the structure of a glow plug 330, 430 . The SOC signal 34 is advantageously supplied to a timing control circuit 26 which delivers a timing control signal 28 to a fuel delivery device, such as the controller 16 associated with a fuel pump 16 . The control circuit 26 stores 65 one or more start of combustion values SOC which indicate the desired timing, relative to an engine cycle 24 , for the start of combustion event as a function of speed 25 and load 27 . One or more adjustment signals Î”SOC are stored 75 and applied 67, 68 as a function of speed and load to adjust the desired signal SOC such that the control signal 28, SOC
