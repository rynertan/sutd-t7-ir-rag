# Diagnostic agent, a process for its preparation and its use in diagnostic methods.

## Abstract
A process for unmasking delta antigen in the blood of an animal, known or caused to be infected with the antigen. The process involves treating serum from the animal with a sur factant and optionally with antibody antigen dissociating agent. The blood derived delta antigen is used as a diagnostic agent in the detection and determination of different classes of antibodies to the delta agent by enzyme immunoassay and radio immunoassay.
