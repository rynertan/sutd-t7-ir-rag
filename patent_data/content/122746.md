# Mixed helix turbulator for heat exchangers.

## Abstract
An improved turbulator and conduit structure for use in heat exchangers. An elongated tube 10 through which fluid to be subject to a heat exchange process of provided with a first outer winding 16 within the tube in substantial abut ment with the inner wall 12 of the tube and a second inner winding 18 at least partially within the first winding 16 . The pitch of the first winding 16 is different from the pitch of the second winding 18 . Consistent heat exchange at extremely low Reynolds numbers is obtainable with the structure. Also disclosed is a method of making such a turbulator and conduit structure.
