# AN IMPROVED HEATING APPLIANCE

## Abstract
A heating appliance 1 comprises a body 2 defining a combustion chamber 3 within which are located burners 4 of a type which rely on atmospheric air drawn into the ap pliance for support of combustion of the fuel supplied to the burners. The opening in the body 2 through which air to support combustion is drawn is closed by two panels 5, 6 each having respective sets of apertures 7, 8 which are located in such a way as not to be in alignment with one another to create a slight resistance to air flow thereby avoid ing the chimney effect of the appliance when the burners 4 are not in operation. The presence of the panels 5, 6 also serves to prevent the loss of heat by radiation from the burners 4 through what would otherwise be an opening in the body 2 , and heating of the panels 5, 6 by such radiation is recovered by conduction to the incoming air during opera tion of the burners.
