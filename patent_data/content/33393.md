# POLYESTER MOLDING COMPOSITION AND PRODUCT

## Abstract
Polyester molding compositions comprising a blend of poly C₂ C₄ alkylene terephthalate with a diepoxy compound, a multiphase composite polymer, and poly C₂ C₄ alkylene terephthalate co alkylene oxide are disclosed. The mul tiphase polymer has a first elastomeric phase polymerized from a monomer system including C₁ C₆ alkyl acrylate as well as crosslinking and graft linking monomers and final rigid thermoplastic phase polymerized in the presence of the elas tomeric phase.
