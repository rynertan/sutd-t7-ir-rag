# Correlation computation.

## Abstract
A correlation computation system takes a sequence of x values and a sequence of y values, provides a set of sums of products of cross related x and y values. In known apparatus, this is done by means of two shift registers for the two sequence of values, and a sequence of multiplyaccumulate devices, in a ladder like structure with each multiply accumulate device form ing a rung fed from a respective stage of each shift register forminv the ladder sides. Since the relative shift between the two shift registers on each cycle is 2, alternate stages have to be empty and each multiply accumulate device is active only on alternate cycles. In the present invention, each shift register stage 11, 1 to n 12, 1 to n feeds two multiplyaccumulate devices 13 , which thus form a zig zag double rung structure. The shift register lenghts are halved, with all stages containing x or y values, and the computation time is also halved, with all multiply accumulate devices active on every cycle.
