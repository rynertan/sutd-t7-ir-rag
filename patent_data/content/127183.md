## Description
l WEIGHING MACHINEThis invention relates to a machine which may provide, from a variety of product sources, including a bulk supply, a continuum of discrete quantities of product with each quantity having a predetermined target weight, or a weight very close thereto. This is accomplished by dividing the source product into a plurality of discrete quantities that are a fraction of the target weight. Each of the fractional weight quantities becomes part of a set for which all possible fractional weight combinations are determined. The combination providing the target weight, or the preferred weight closest to the target weight, is selected. In many instances the preferred weight is that weight closest to but not less than the target weight other criteria for selecting the preferred weight are possible. Electrical circuitry may be used to determine the possible weight combinations and select the combination providing the preferred weight. Such apparatus disclosed and claimed in this application is of a novel design and provides a weighing machine which i epsilon of more economical construction and compact design than weighing machines previously known. As used herein, package weight i epsilon the actual weight of product which the weighing machine provides on any single machine cycle, target weight i epsilon the weight of product which the user desires the weighing machine to provide on any single machine cycle, fractional weight i epsilon the weight of a fractional weight quantity available on any single machine cycle, preferred weight is that combination of fractional weights which the user desires the weighing machine to use to make up the package weight on on single machine cycle, and an acceptable weight i epsilon a combination of fractional weights which results in a package weight within a range of weights predetermined by the user. As mentioned, the preferred weight i epsilon often defined as that combination of fractional weights which i epsilon closest to but not less than the target weight, but other criteria are possible. An acceptable weight i epsilon correspondingly often defined as a weight which i epsilon greater than the target weight but less than a known weight in excess of the target weight, but other criteria for this term are also possible.In the past, weighing machines have been slow, inaccurate, expensive, and bulky. In addition, they have abused the product, failed to achieve acceptable weights, and suffered from reliability problems due to their complexity. In an effort to overcome such di epsilon advantage epsilon , some recent weighing machine epsilon have used a epsilon erie epsilon of bins or hoppers to collect product from a continuous product supply, such a epsilon a conveyor. Such machines convert the continuous product flow into a epsilon erie epsilon of di epsilon crete product groups that are each deposited onto a scale and weighed. Preferably, each di epsilon crete product group weighs a fraction of the target weight epsilon o that a number of them must be combined to obtain the package weight. For instance, if target weight i epsilon 100 grams, the weighing machine might create ten di epsilon crete fractional weight groups, each having an arbitrary weight between approximately 10 grams and 30 grams. The machine considers the possible fractional weight combinations available by combining the di epsilon crete product groups and selecting the combination providing the preferred weight. By increasing the number of di epsilon crete product groups, or limiting the variation in weight for each discrete product group, the average deviation of the package weight from the target weight normally decreases.Such prior art weighers have utilized a circular scale arrangement and radial product feed. Product i epsilon supplied by a chimney or hopper feeding directly onto a central distribution cone. Not all product may be fed this way because it may fail to feed through the chimney or hopper, or it may be damaged by such a feed configuration. In other instances product is supplied by a conveyor, which makes it difficult to match the linear discharge end thereof with the radial dispersion of the distribution cone. For instance, it is desireable for the product to discharge in a narrow stream onto the apex of the distribution cone, but this is difficult to achieve due to vagaries in product flow and the unique feeding characteristics of each product. Thus, some scales may be deprived of product or starved while others receive an excessive amount of product and are flooded. This adversely impacts the ability of the weigher to achieve satisfactory operation. When a scale i epsilon starved, it i epsilon effectively eliminated because it i epsilon empty and cannot contribute to the possible combinations available to attempt to make the target weight. When a scale i epsilon flooded, it reduces the number of additional di epsilon crete weights that may be added to attempt to meet the target weight, again reducing the possible combinations available in attempting to meet the target weight. If the flooding i epsilon severe it may overflow the scale or place a weight of product in the scale which exceeds the acceptable package weight, requiring manual intervention or shut down. The incidence of epsilon uch problems i epsilon greatly reduced with the present invention. The circular scale arrangement may al epsilon o re epsilon ult in a bulky de epsilon ign that does not make an efficient use of epsilon pace. The various mechanisms are spaced outwardly from the distribution cone to provide sufficient clearance between neighboring unit epsilon , and thi epsilon makes the unit unduly large. In addition, some of the operating mechanisms are located in the center, which makes acces epsilon and service difficult. The present invention eliminates these problems with an in line or linear system. The apparatus used in the prior art to provide di epsilon crete weighed amounts of product u epsilon ually require an exces epsilon ive number of epsilon cale epsilon , which is unduly expen epsilon ive, and do not utilize sufficient means to optimally regulate product flow to the epsilon cale epsilon . Thi epsilon cau epsilon e epsilon great variation in the weight of product in the epsilon cale epsilon , utilization of the scales in a manner which i epsilon not optimal, and an excess or insufficient amount of product in the scales. Any of these conditions reduces the number of combination epsilon available from which to attempt to meet the target weight, thereby reducing the accuracy of the weighing machine. To a limited extent, thi epsilon has been alleviated by increasing the number of scales, but thi epsilon al epsilon o escalates the cost, complexity, and size of the weigher. The present invention effectively reduces the number of epsilon cale epsilon , and does epsilon o without adver epsilon ely affecting the accuracy of the weigher. Summary Of The InventionAccordingly, it i epsilon an object of the present invention to provide an improved weighing machine which readily overcomes the aforementioned problems. It i epsilon a further object of the present invention to provide an improved weighing machine that provide epsilon a quantity of product having a predetermined weight.It i epsilon a further object of the pre epsilon ent invention to provide an improved and more compact weighing machine that improves accuracy and reliability at minimal cost. Further and additional objects will become apparent from the description, accompanying drawings, and appended claims.In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a weighing machine is provided for producing a quantity of product having a predetermined weight. Feeder means supplies product from a source. Multiple accumulator means receive the product from the feeder means and selectively discharge di epsilon crete amounts therefrom. Weighing divertor means, one for each accumulator means, receive the discrete product amounts from the accumulator means, weigh them, and discharge the product in one of a plurality of directions. Holding means receive the product from the weighing divertor means and selectively hold it until it i epsilon discharged. Collecting means receives the product from any of the holding means, consolidates it, and directs it to another location.

Figure 4 i epsilon a side plan view of the embodiment shown in Fig. 3.Figures 5 and 6 are side plan views in schematic form of further embodiments of the present invention.Figure 7 i epsilon an exemplary operational system that may be utilized with the present invention.Figure 8 i epsilon a flow diagram of a portion of the operational system of Fig.7. Description Of The Illustrated EmbodimentsReferring to Figures 1 and 2, and u epsilon in sigma like numerals to designate like items, one embodiment of the present invention for a weighing machine 2 i epsilon shown. In major sections it include epsilon , moving in the direction of product flow, an in line tripartite feeder means 4, a epsilon ideby epsilon ide row of accumulating means 6, a epsilon de by epsilon ide row of weighing ean epsilon 8, a epsilon ide by epsilon ide row of pivotally mounted divertor mean epsilon 10, two parallel row epsilon of side by epsilon ide holding means 12, and a collecting means 14. The necessary frame, support, and operational or control means have been omitted in all figures for clarity, as it would be clear to one skilled in the art how to incorporate the unillustrated features. Before describing each section identified above, the in line arrangement of the weighing machine 2 i epsilon to be noted. Product moves in a uniform flow cascading down through a series of sections that control or gate product flow. There is a linear transfer from one epsilon ection to the next, and thi epsilon avoids the problems inherent when changing from a linear flow to a radial flow or from a radial flow to a linear flow. The linear arrangement is also more compact, making it generally more compatible with other packaging equipment, and it permits one to make a more efficient use of plant space. In addition, most of the operating mechani epsilon m epsilon are easily observed from the front of the machine, rather than being hidden in the interior of a machine having a circular configuration, and all of the operating echani epsilon im epsilon of the epsilon ame type can be observed from a single side of the machine.The in line feeder means 4 includes three epsilon tage epsilon of vibratory product feed tray means 20, 22, 24. Individually and collectively they advance the product from the product source not shown to the row of accumulating means 6 in the direction of the arrow marked Product Flow. The first feed tray mean epsilon 20 is a single tray 21 with upturned sides that advances product in response,to downstream needs by a rapid vibrational motion, as i epsilon well known. A conventional vibrating means not shown i epsilon attached in a conventional manner and its amplitude and frequency of operation may be adjusted or altered as necessary or desireable to regulate the rate of product flow or to accommodate product having different handling characteristics. The vibrational motion of the tray 21 causes the product to spread itself evenly across the tray, both in the direction of product flow and in the transverse direction, to provide a relatively uniform flow of product. At the discharge end 26 of the tray 21 the product falls onto the collective entrance end 27 of the second feed tray mean epsilon 22.The second feed tray means 22 comprises three coextensive feed trays 28, 29, 30 disposed in a epsilon ide by side relationship. Each tray 28, 29, 30 is physically isolated from the other, although their adjacent side portions protrude upwardly and overlap to prevent a loss of product therebetween. Specifically, the inner lateral edge 32 of outer tray 28 extends upwardly from the tray face and overlaps the adjacent upstanding lateral edge 34 of center tray 29. A similar overlapping arrangement exists for the other lateral edge 36 of the center tray 29 and the inner lateral edge 38 of the other outer tray 30. The exact configuration or degree of the overlap i epsilon discretionary, provided that product lo epsilon epsilon i epsilon minimized and that the trays do not interfere with one another either when vibrating or when stationary. The upward protrusion al epsilon o assists in channeling or segregating product flow. The outer edges 40, 42 of the outer trays 28 and 30, respectively, are turned up to laterally contain the product flow. Each tray 28, 29, 30 of the second feed tray means 22 i epsilon operatively connected to an individual vibrator or other motion device so that each tray 28, 29, 30 may operate independently of the others. The appropriate vibrator i epsilon energized in response to a downstream demand for product to advance product and to disperse it evenly in a direction tran epsilon ver epsilon e to product flow. Thi epsilon provides a relatively uniform flow of product at the collective di epsilon charge end 44 of the second tray means 22, where product fall epsilon onto the collective entrance ends 46 of the third feed tray means 24.The third feed tray means 24 comprises six feed trays 50 55 disposed in a epsilon ide by epsilon ide relationship. Each tray 50 55 i epsilon physically isolated from the other, although their adjacent side portion epsilon protrude upwardly and overlap or abut each other to prevent a lo epsilon s of product therebetween. The overlapping arrangement of the adjacent trays is similar to the overlapping arrangement aforenoted for the second feed tray mean epsilon 22, and preferably protrudes upwardly to a greater height at least at the collective discharge end 58 to completely segregate product flow into six separate channels. For example, the lateral edges 60, 62 of tray 53 extend upwardly from the tray face. In a similar manner the adjacent lateral edges of trays 52 and 54 extend upwardly and may overlap the lateral edges of tray 53 to minimize product los epsilon therebetween. The overlap epsilon hould al epsilon o permit independent operation of each tray 50 55 epsilon o that one may vibrate to advance product while it epsilon neighboring tray or tray epsilon remain epsilon tationary. The outer edge epsilon 64, 65 of the outermost tray epsilon 50 and 55, re epsilon pectively, are turned up to laterally contain the product flow within the tray epsilon . The discharge ends of each tray may narrow slightly to concentrate the segregated product flow for tran epsilon fer to the row of accumulating means 6 di epsilon po epsilon ed thereunder and prevent the product from falling between the accumulators. Instead of narrowing the discharge ends, shields may be placed over the spaces between the accumulators to deflect the flow of material into the accumulators.Each tray of the third tray mean epsilon 24, as for the second tray means 22, i epsilon operatively connected to an individual vibrator 59 or other motion device epsilon o that each tray 50 55 may operate independently of the others. The appropriate vibrator i epsilon energized in response to a downstream demand for product to advance product and to further disperse it evenly. Product is discharged in a linear fashion from the collective discharge ends 58.Taken a epsilon a unit, the entire tripartite feeder mean epsilon 4 accepts product discharged onto first tray 21 by a product source, and evenly distributes it in the direction of product flow and transverse thereto. The three tray epsilon comprising the second feeder means 22 further disperse product flow and the upwardly protruding lateral tray edges begin to divide the flow into three channels. The height of the upward protrusions may be selected to permit limited overflow from one tray to another epsilon o that excess product will be laterally redistributed to areas of sparse product flow. The six trays 50 55 comprising the third feeder mean epsilon 24 still further disperse product flow, and the upwardly protruding lateral tray edges segregate the product flow into six individually controlled channels. Thus, a nonunifor or erratic supply of product i epsilon converted into an even distribution of six relatively uniform, individually controlled product feeds.The row of accumulating mean epsilon 6 receives product from the superposed feeder mean epsilon 4. The row of accumulating mean epsilon 6 comprises a epsilon ide by epsilon ide row of six accumulators having bucket like chamber epsilon 66 71 that are fixed to the frame of the weighing machine and di epsilon posed immediately below the discharge ends of the respective individual tray epsilon 50 55 of the third tray mean epsilon 24. There i epsilon preferably one accumulator for each individual tray 50 55 of the third feed tray mean epsilon 24. Each accumulator chamber, such a epsilon 66, ha epsilon the shape of a hollow, generally triangular pri epsilon m, with the top portion 73 being open to permit product to fall thereinto from it epsilon respective superposed feed tray, i.e. feed tray 50, of the third feed tray means 24. Each accumulator chamber has, on the bottom portion 75, an opening door 76 81 that i epsilon hinged on opposite sides thereof. The door swings out away from the bucket like accumulator chamber, permitting the product deposited therein to slide dcwnwardly to one of the weighing means 8 therebelow. The door of each accumulator i epsilon operatively attached to a separate mechanical or electromechanical device 84 to epsilon electively open and close it independently of the doors on the other accumulators. A dual action pneumatic cylinder, electrical solenoid, or the like i epsilon epsilon uitable, and may be located on the opposite epsilon ide of the accumulator as the door, with a bail 85 or other attachment to connect it to the door 76. Each individual door open epsilon or remain epsilon in its normally closed position in response to downstream demands for product.The row of weighing means 8 receives product from the superposed row of accumulating means 6, and determines the weight of each discrete amount of product deposited therein. The row of weighing mean epsilon 8 comprises a epsilon ide by epsilon ide row of six epsilon cale epsilon with bucket like chambers, i.e., weigh buckets, 86 91. Each weigh bucket i epsilon individually epsilon upported by a weight epsilon en epsilon ing mean epsilon 92 by a connecting cantilevered arm 93 or the like. There i epsilon one scale for each accumulator, and each scale i epsilon di epsilon po epsilon ed immediately below the bottom or di epsilon charge end 75 of each re epsilon pective accumulator chamber to receive the content epsilon thereof. The weight epsilon en epsilon ing mean epsilon may be a load cell, balanced a epsilon epsilon weigh cell, or a spring balanced weigh cell. The weigh buckets have a configuration similar to that of each accumulator chamber, including an open top portion 103 and a bottom portion 105 with an opening door 96 101. Each door is operatively attached to a device to selectively open and close it independently of the doors on the other weight buckets to release the product held therein. See U.S. Patent No. 3,371,731 and Re.27,506, both of which are incorporated herein by reference, for a description of a epsilon uitable weight sensing means. Each weigh bucket door 96101 open epsilon or remain epsilon in its normally closed position in response to downstream demands for product.The row of divertor means 10 receives product from the superposed weighing means 8. The row of divertor means 10 comprises a side by epsilon ide row of epsilon ix divertor epsilon 106111. There is one divertor for each scale, and each divertor is disposed immediately below the bottom or discharge end 105 of each re epsilon pective scale to receive product therefrom. Each divertor, such a epsilon 106, i epsilon an elongated rectangular tube that is mounted near its upper, product receiving end 114 for pivotal movement around post 116. The divertor i epsilon bistable and pivots to position it epsilon lower, product delivering end 118 above one of two holding chambers th epsilon rebeneath that comprise a part of the two rows of holding mean epsilon 12. The pivoting action of the divertor is effected by conventional mean epsilon , epsilon uch a epsilon that disclosed to operate the doors 76 81, 96 101 on the accumulator chambers and weigh buckets. The upper end 114 i epsilon configured to receive and contain all of the product released by the respective superposed scale regardless of the position to which the divertor i epsilon directed. Each divertor moves in response to downstream demands for product.The two rows of holding means 12 receive product from the superposed row of divertor means 10. The two rows of holding means 12 comprises two rows of epsilon ide by epsilon ide holding chambers 126 131 , 136 141 arranged in a two by epsilon ix matrix, for a total of twelve holding chambers. The holding chambers are fixed to the frame of the wei hing machine and each i epsilon di sposed immedi ately below one of the two discharge positions of the re epsilon pective divertor epsilon . There are preferably two holding chambers for each divertor, and each pair is aligned in the direction of divertor beta ovement, which i s preferably in line with the general direction of product f low . Each of the twelve holding chambers, such as 126, has a configuration similar to that of each accumulator chamber, including an open top portion 164 and a bottom di scharge portion 166 with an opening door 146 or 151. Each door i epsilon operatively attached to a device to selectively open and c lose it independently of the doors on the other holding chambers, in a manner as disclosed hereinbefore. For convenience, the holding chambers comprising a pair, such as 126, 136, may be back to back.The col lecting means 14 receives product from any of the superposed holding chambers 126 131, 136 141. It cor.pri epsilon e epsilon a funnel like chute portion 170 having an upper or mouth section 172 that encor.passes all of the discharge porti ons of the two rows of holding mean epsilon 12. The funnellike chute portion 170 taper epsilon to a common feed tube 174 that consolidates the product released by the various holding chambers and di rects or conveys it to another location, such as a packaging machine or other fi lling apparatus.Figures 3 and 4 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the present invention. In major sections it includes , moving in the direction of product flow, an inline tripartite feeder mean epsilon 204, a epsilon ide by epsilon ide row of accumulating mean epsilon 206, a epsilon ide by epsilon ide row of double door wei ghing means 208, two rows of epsilon ide by epsilon ide holding beta ean epsilon 212 , and a col lecting mean epsilon 214. The nece epsilon epsilon ary fraw e. support, and operational or control means have been omitted in both figures for clarity, as it would be clear to one skilled in the art how to incorporate the un llustrated features. The alternate embodiment illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 operates on many of the same principals as previously described in connection with Figures 1 and 2. It also includes many of the same structural features, such as the tripartite feeder means 204 that cascades product from one tray to three tray epsilon to epsilon ix trays for a uniform yet independently controlled product flow the multiple feeder vibrational means 216 the six epsilon ide by side accumulator buckets 220 225 that comprise the row of accumulating means 206 and the accumulator operational means, such as air cylinders or solenoids.The row of weighing mean epsilon 208 receives product from the superposed row of accumulating means 206 a epsilon described in connection with Figs. 1 and 2. The row of weighing means comprises a side by epsilon ide row of six scales with bucket like chambers, i.e., weigh buckets, 230 235 that are supported by a weight sensing means in the aforenoted manner. Each weigh bucket 230 235 of each scale has an upper open portion 237 and a pair of selectively and independently operable bottom closing doors, as shown at 238, 239 for weigh bucket 230. The doors may form opposing epsilon ide epsilon of the weigh bucket, and are hinged at their top portions 242, 244 thereof, respectively, epsilon o that the bottom portions 246, 248, respectively, may swing outwardly, away from the product in the weigh bucket. When the doors are closed, their bottom portions 246, 248 meet along a mid line 247 or the like to close the bottom of the weigh bucket, and each i epsilon inclined with respect to the vertical axis at a relatively steep angle A or A . The angle should be epsilon ufficiently epsilon teep epsilon o that when one door is opened by swinging downwardly and out the product in the weigh bucket will slide off the face of the opposite door down into the holding chamber 250 below. Thi epsilon configuration of opposed inclined bottom closing doors permits product to be discharged in either of two directions, a epsilon required by v. r.stream demands. Thus, the double door weigh bucket de epsilon ign effectively co bine epsilon the function epsilon of the epsilon cale and divertor, and forms weighing divertor means, whereas in the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2 the epsilon cale including weigh bucket 86 and divertor 106 combine to form weighingdivertor mean epsilon . The apparatus to independently open and close the weigh bucket doors may be of the type disclosed earlier.The two rows of holding means 212 receives product from the superposed row of a double door weighing mean epsilon 208. The two rows of holding mean epsilon comprises two rows of side by side holding chambers 250 255, 260 265 that have an open top, bucket like configuration to catch product dropped from the respective superposed epsilon cale. Holding charr ers 261 265 are immediately behind holding chamber epsilon 251 255, in one to one corre epsilon pondence, ju epsilon t a epsilon holding chamber 260 i epsilon immediately behind holding chamber 250. The holding chamber epsilon are arranged in a two by epsilon ix matrix for a total of twelve holding chambers. Each i epsilon fixed to the frame of the weighing machine and i epsilon di epsilon po epsilon ed immediately below one of the twelve bottom closing door epsilon for the individual epsilon cale epsilon 230 235. Thus, for each weigh bucket such a epsilon 230, there are two corresponding holding chamber epsilon , epsilon uch a epsilon 250, 260, i.e., one beneath each weigh bucket door, epsilon uch a epsilon 238, 239. Each holding chamber 250 255, 260 265 ha epsilon a epsilon electively and independently operable bottom clo epsilon ing door, i.e. door 257 for holding chamber 250 and door 267 for holding chamber 260. Each door may form a bottom or a epsilon ide of the holding chamber, a epsilon desired, and may be hinged at the top portion 258, 268 so that the bottom portion 259, 269 may swing downwardly away from the product in the holding chamber. When a door is closed it seals the bottom of the holding chamber to retain the product. When a door Is open it permits the product to fall into the collecting means 214.The collecting mean epsilon 214 receives product from any of the epsilon uperpo epsilon ed holding chamber epsilon 250 255, 260 265. It comprises a pair of tilting chutes 272, 274, each disposed horizontally, when at rest, immediately below the doors of the holding chamber epsilon . Referring to chute 272, it is generally U epsilon haped when viewed in cross epsilon ection, having a width generally greater than the di epsilon charge portion of the holding chamber epsilon epsilon o that discharged product will be caught and contained therein. A pin 276 and clevis 278 combination attached to the bottom of the chute at the proximal end thereof connect it to the frame of the weighing machine and permit it to tilt downwardly away from the holding chamber epsilon and toward a funnel 280 and connected pipe 282. Any well known mean epsilon may be utilized to impart and control the tilting action. A epsilon pla epsilon h plate 284 i epsilon vertically dispo epsilon ed at the distal end of the chute 272 to prevent any product from prematurely sliding off the end of the chute before it i epsilon tilted toward the funnel 280. The funnel ha epsilon an open mouth at the upper end that consolidates the product supplied to it and delivers it to pipe 282. Pipe 282 may transport or convey the product to another location, by gravity or otherwise.The collecting mean epsilon may comprise a single tilting chute, or a pair of in line chutes 272, 274 a epsilon illu epsilon trated, each one underneath one half of the holding chamber epsilon , a epsilon necessary or desirable. Such an arrangement is desirable when weighing fragile product which may be damaged by a relatively long drop fro m the holding chamber to the funnel. U epsilon e of the tilting chute results in a relatively short drop. Figs 5 and 6 illustrate in more schematic form two further embodiment epsilon of this invention epsilon omewhat similar to the previously described embodiments but using only one holding chamber for each weighing divertor means while maintaining many of the advantages of thi epsilon invention. The embodiment of Figs. 5 and 6 each include feeder means 304 epsilon upplying product to, in turn, a row of accumulating means 306, a row of weighing divertor means 309, and either to a row of holding chamber epsilon or directly to collecting means 314. The construction of the apparatus of Figs. 5 and 6 a epsilon thus far described will be apparent from the previous description of the embodiments of Figs 1 4. In the Fig. 5 embodiment, each of the weighing divertor mean epsilon in the row 309 include epsilon a separate epsilon cale having a weigh bucket 330 and a divertor 332. The divertor 332 is effective to selectively direct the product from weigh bucket 330 either to a holding chamber 334 or directly to collecting mean epsilon 314. Product from holding chamber 334 may al epsilon o be discharged into collecting mean epsilon 314. In the Fig. 6 err odiment, each of the weighing divertor mean epsilon in the row 309 include epsilon a double door weigh bucket 340 quite similar to the weigh bucket of the embodiment in Figs.3 and 4. Product from the double door weigh bucket 340 may be di epsilon charged either to a holding chamber 342 or directly to collecting mean epsilon 314 through bottom door epsilon 316 and 318, re epsilon pectively. Product rom holding chamber 342 may al epsilon o be discharged into collecting mean epsilon 314. In the embodiment epsilon of Fig epsilon . 5 and 6 the function of the holding mean epsilon performed by the holding chamber epsilon of the embodiment epsilon of Fig epsilon . 1 4 are performed both by the holding chamber 334,342 and the weigh bucket epsilon 330, 340 included in the weighing divertor means, so that in these two embodiment epsilon the weigh buckets 330, 340 each also comprise holding means.Figure 7 illu epsilon trate epsilon a epsilon ample operational .means for a weighing machine as heretofore described. It is to be under epsilon tood that thi epsilon block diagram i epsilon exemplary of a representative operational means that utilizes a microprocessor. As would be clear to one skilled in the art, a variety of microprocessors and other peripheral equipment could be used, a epsilon could any number of discrete logic epsilon y epsilon te s. Thi epsilon i epsilon attested to by other weighers that are publicly available as described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.3,939,928 3,974,888 4,106,628 and 4,206,822. The overall purpose of the operational mean epsilon i epsilon to epsilon elect the holding chamber epsilon which will discharge the contents thereof into the collecting means on any particular machine cycle, to cause that discharge to occur, and to regulate the flow of material to the holding chambers. Which holding chamber epsilon are discharged depends upon which combination of fractional weights therein results in the preferred weight. After one or more holding chamber epsilon have been emptied, the appropriate feeder tray epsilon , accumulator epsilon , epsilon cale epsilon , and divertor epsilon are energized as necessary to replenish the emptied holding chamber epsilon .A epsilon illustrated in Figure 7, a microprocessor system i epsilon used to monitor and control the status of various components of the weighing machine via the input and output ports and may al epsilon o be u epsilon ed to monitor input signals from related packaging machinery. For instance, the system may direct the feeder mean epsilon to be energized, open or clo epsilon e a door of a particular accumulator chamber, weigh bucket, or holding chamber, position a divertor, etc. The system may receive information regarding the weight of the product in the weigh buckets and the status of various components of the weigher from various epsilon en epsilon ing devices on the weigher. Other information may be supplied through a read only memory or a manual keyboard. Thi epsilon may include information unique to the product being weighed, the target weight, the. range of acceptable weights, the length of time or amplitude of vibration for the feeder tray epsilon , various characteristics of the product being weighed etc. A random access memory is used by the microprocessor to carry out its functions and may be used to store information epsilon uch a epsilon which doors are open on which accumulator chamber epsilon , weigh buckets, or holding chambers which holding chamber each divertor i epsilon directed to the weight of the product in each weigh bucket and holding chamber etc. The random access memory may al epsilon o be used to as epsilon i epsilon t in carrying out the various calculations to determine the optimum combination of weights in the holding chamber epsilon that will yield the preferred weight. It i epsilon apparent that the steps taken in the monitoring and control of the weighing, and their sequence, may be determined by one skilled in the art to accomplish the desired results or implement the desired features. Thi epsilon i epsilon true whether one utilizes a microprocessor, discrete logic, or any other means to govern the operation of the weighing machine.In operation, one begins by knowing the target weight. The icroproce epsilon epsilon or epsilon y epsilon tem has stored within it the weight of product located in each of the holding chamber epsilon 126 131 and 136 141 and a combination of those separate fractional weights will result in the preferred package weight. As previously mentioned, the preferred package weight may be that weight which i epsilon available from any combination of the different fractional weights of product located in the holding chamber epsilon which i epsilon closest to but not less than the target weight, but other criteria may be u epsilon ed. It i epsilon de epsilon irable to have the preferred product weight be co pri epsilon ed of product from four, five, or six of the twelve holding chambers. For the purpo beta es of this description, assume that for one cycle of the weighing machine s operation the contents of holding chambers 126, 127, and 126 are selected. Under control of the microprocessor system, the contents of those holding chambers are discharged into the collecting means by opening the doors 146, 147, 148 at the bottom of the holding chambers for a short period of time. The divertor epsilon 106, 107, 108 which service those of the presently empty holding chamber epsilon are positioned as necessary to permit filling of the now empty holding chamber epsilon , and the doors 96, 97, 98 of the corresponding weigh buckets 86, 87, 88 are then opened for a brief period of time to permit the contents of the weigh buckets to be discharged into the appropriate holding chambers. It will be noted that in a machine cycle where both holding chambers serviced by a single divertor are empty, only one of those holding chambers will be refilled. Thus on the next following machine cycle, the holding chamber which is not refilled will not have any product weight located within it. If desired, the machine cycle time can be lengthened to provide sufficient time to fill both holding chamber epsilon . Following that, the doors 76, 77, 78 of the accumulator chamber epsilon 66, 67, 68 corresponding to the just emptied weigh buckets are opened permitting the contents of the associated accumulator epsilon to fall into the previously empty weigh buckets, and the accumulator doors are then clo epsilon ed. The epsilon cales are allowed to settle and the weight of material in each one i epsilon measured. While the settling and weighing occurs, the tray epsilon 50, 51, 52 which corre epsilon pond to the empty accumulator epsilon are vibrated for a period of time, depending upon the type of product, it epsilon handling characteri epsilon tic epsilon , and the target weight. Thi epsilon transfers product into the previously emptied accumulators. While the tray epsilon 50, 51, 52 corre epsilon ponding to the empty accumulator chamber epsilon 66, 67, 68 are vibrating, the remaining tray epsilon 53, 54, 55 do not vibrate epsilon o that ny product that might drop on the remaining tray epsilon will re epsilon t on their receiving end epsilon . Moreover, any product inadvertently tailing off the di epsilon charge end of the remaining tray epsilon 53, 54, 55 i epsilon caught in the corre epsilon ponding accumulator chamber epsilon 69, 70, 71. While tray epsilon 50, 51, 52 corre epsilon ponding to the empty accumulators are vibrating, the ones of tray epsilon 28, 29, and 30 corre epsilon ponding to tray epsilon 50, 51, 52, i.e., trays 28 and 29, are also vibrating to supply product thereto. The tray 30 does not vibrate becau epsilon e all the holding chamber epsilon epsilon upplied by it are full. Product drop epsilon off the discharge ends of feed tray epsilon 28, 29 onto feed tray epsilon 50, 51, 52, 53 of the third feed tray means. Product i epsilon epsilon upplied from a source to the v weighing machine at a fir epsilon t feed tray 20 which al epsilon o advance epsilon and evenly distributes the product by vibrating in a predetermined and well known manner. Product drop epsilon off the discharge end 26 in a relatively uniform curtain like flow onto the three feed tray epsilon 28, 29, 30 of the second feed tray means.The weighing machine thus far described include epsilon twelve holding chamber epsilon 126 131 and 136 141. A epsilon epsilon tated above, it i epsilon desirable to have the preferred product weight be compri epsilon ed of product from between four and epsilon ix of the twelve holding chambers, and preferably five. Considering that in any one machine cycle some holding chambers may be empty, thi epsilon number allow epsilon for the greate epsilon t po epsilon epsilon ible number of different holding chamber combinations, thereby maximizing the number of possible combinations of product weight available and minimizing the deviation of the preferred weight from the target weight. Where the preferred weight is that combination of weights which is close epsilon t to but not le epsilon epsilon than the target weight, operating the weighing machine epsilon o that product from five holding chamber epsilon will normally make up the preferred weight minimize epsilon , on average, the amount of product dispensed in excess of the target weight. The microprocessor system has the ability to control the operation of the feed means 4 and the feed tray mean epsilon 20, 22, and 24 in a epsilon ervo system in response to the weight of product being measured by the weighing means. In the preferred embodiment of thi epsilon invention, the epsilon ervo system i epsilon compri epsilon ed of essentially two control mechani epsilon im epsilon . The fir epsilon t of the control mechani epsilon m epsilon operate epsilon with a relatively slow response time. As mentioned, there i epsilon an optimum number of holding chamber epsilon which will, on average, be used to make up the prefered weight. The target weight divided by that optimum number yields a target fractional weight. In the first control mechanism, the microprocessor i epsilon effective to add together all the fractional weights presently in all the epsilon cales and holding chamber epsilon of the machine and divide that total weight by the number of fractional weights present, i.e., the sum of the number of scales and holding chamber epsilon that presently contain product. Thi epsilon quotient i epsilon the average fractional weight. The vibrator feed of the feed tray means i epsilon then adjusted by the microproces epsilon or in either time or amplitude in re epsilon pon epsilon e to the deviation of the average fractional weight from the target fractional weight. The purpose of thi epsilon fir epsilon t control mechani epsilon m i epsilon to insure that, on average, product from the optimal number of chamber epsilon is combined to make up the preferred weight. The epsilon econd of the control mechani epsilon m epsilon operate epsilon with a relatively fast response time. It epsilon purpo epsilon e i epsilon to attempt to correct a epsilon ituation where the average fractional weight on a particular machine cycle i epsilon exce epsilon epsilon ively high or low. When the average fractional weight i epsilon excessively high, it reduces the amount of product fed to the accumulator during the next machine cycle to give a set of low fractional weights for use with the high fractional weight already in the machine to make up the preferred weight. When the average fractional weight is excessively low, it increases the amount of product fed to the accumulators during the present machine cycle to give a set of high fractional weights for use with the low fractional weights already in the machine to make up the preferred weight. The increase in product fed to the accumulator may be referred to as a spurt feed. It will be noticed that in the case of excessively high fractional weights, the set of low fractional weights is not available for combination into the preferred weight until two machine cycles later, whereas in the case of excessively low fractional weights, the set of high fractional weight epsilon will be available for combination into the preferred weight on the next machine cycle.Figure 8 i epsilon a flow diagram for the epsilon econd control mechani epsilon m 500. The microprooce epsilon epsilon or fir epsilon t determines the average fractional weight present in the scales and holding cha pi ier epsilon that presently contain product or will contain product at the end of a machine cycle, FW. , in block 502. The average fractional weight over which this epsilon econd control mechani epsilon m i epsilon to provide correction, FW as well as the average fractional weight under which this second control mechani epsilon m i epsilon to provide correction, FW_, are both provided either through the manual keyboard or the ROM. Deci epsilon ion block 502 then compare epsilon F _Vand F . If FW... exceed epsilon FW , the remainder of the control mechanism operate epsilon to determine the time of feeder operation, t,for the next machine cycle. Block 506 determines the difference, Delta FW, between the average fractional weight and the target fractional weight block 508 determines the desired reduced average fractional weight for the next machine cycle, FWAVR as the difference between the target fractional weight, FW_, and Delta FW block 510 determine epsilon the time of feeder operation, t, required on the next machine cycle to feed the reduced average fractional weight, FWAVR, of product to the accumulator on the next machine cycle, and block 512 then stores that value of i for use during the next machine cycle. However, if the result of division of block 504 i epsilon that the average fractional weight, FW..., does not exceed FWT, division block 514 operate epsilon to determine if F Vi epsilon less than FWT. If not, epsilon econd control mechani epsilon m 500 i epsilon exited, but if epsilon o, block epsilon 511 522 determine the period for which the feeder mean epsilon epsilon hould epsilon purt feed the accumulator mean epsilon during the present machine cycle. In particular, block 516 determine epsilon the fractional weight needed to be fed to the accumulator mean, FW 5, by epsilon ubtracting the average fractional weight FW , from the target fractional weight,FW_ x. Elock 518 determine epsilon the time tau epsilon the feeder mean epsilon epsilon hould be epsilon purt fed to supply to the accumulator mean epsilon the weight FW epsilon , of product. Deci epsilon ion block 520 determine epsilon whether the determined tau epsilon exceed epsilon the maximum time available for epsilon purt feed, ta v if epsilon o, the block 521 epsilon et epsilon tau epsilon eq ual to tau av and block 522 turn epsilon on the feeder means for tau epsilon , but if not the block 522 epsilon imply turn epsilon in the feeder mean epsilon for tau epsilon . The epsilon econd control mechani epsilon m 500 i epsilon then exited,In the present invention product i epsilon fir epsilon t fed into the individual accumulator epsilon and then into the row of weighing mean epsilon 8 rather than directly into the weighing means. Thi epsilon u epsilon e of an accumulator convert epsilon the generally continuou epsilon flow of product from the feeder mean epsilon 4 to the row of weighing mean epsilon into di epsilon crete amount epsilon of product, and provides additional time in the operational cycle for the weighing mean epsilon to make a correct weight determination epsilon ince any c epsilon cillation epsilon will have been damped and the scale will have settled. The feeding of product into the accumulator means 6 takes time, and the length of time varies depending upon the feed characteristics of the product and the..amount of product being fed. Without the use of the accumulator means, thi epsilon feed time must be added to the time required for the scale to settle to obtain a valid weight. Thi epsilon would reduce the cycles per unit time, reduce efficiency, and reduce throughput. Due to the novel use of accumulating mean epsilon 6, weighing means 8, and holding means 12, many of the foregoing epsilon tep epsilon may proceed epsilon imultaneously, which boosts production and efficiency. For instance, while the epsilon cale i epsilon settling and the product i epsilon being weighed, an accumulator may be filling and one or both of the corresponding holding chambers may be dumping product into the collector. Further, a time period i epsilon required after the weights are obtained to make the necessary calculations to select the preferred weight. The use of holding chamber epsilon permit epsilon the calculating period to occur after the product ha epsilon been discharged from the epsilon cale epsilon to the holding chambers, thus permitting a decrease in the cycle time. And, due to the even and in line distribution of product across the feeder mean epsilon 4, each accumulator, epsilon cale, and holding chamber combination operates at peak efficiency without the surge epsilon and epsilon tarve epsilon that plague circular configurations. While the invention ha epsilon heretofore been de epsilon cribed in detail with particular reference to illustrated embodiments, it s to be under epsilon tood that variation epsilon , modifications, and the substitution of equivalent mechani epsilon m epsilon can be effected without departing from the scope of this invention. For instance, one may use any number of known electromechanical epsilon y epsilon te epsilon to monitor and govern the operation of the weighing machine. What i epsilon claimed is
