# POWDER ACTUATED TOOL WITH GAS VENTING HANDLE

## Abstract
A powder actuated fastener setting tool is provided with a gas venting and sound muffling housing which extends laterally from the tool housing so as to be usable as a gripping handle for the tool. The inside of the gas venting and sound muffling housing is divided into a series of chambers through which combustion gases are bled, there being openings between each of the chambers to allow combustion gases to pass successively through the chambers. The cross sectional area of the respective openings increases progressively away from the tool barrel.
