# A FLEXIBLE CONTAINER FOR TRANSPORTING AND STORING BULK GOODS

## Abstract
A flexible container 1 for transporting and storing bulk goods comprises an outer sack 2 of a strong and load bear ing material and an inner impervious sack 3 which is loose initially. A pressure sensitive adhesive 5 has been applied onto one or more pairs of corresponding adhesive zones 4, 7, 8 on at least one of the opposing sides of the sacks 2, 3 . Subsequently, the pairs of corresponding adhesive zones have been sealingly pressed together about the adhesive 5 . The adhesive presents such a low inner cohesion force that the pairs of corresponding adhesive zones 4, 7, 8 can be completely or partially separated when the inner sack 3 has expanded within the outer sack 2 by blast air or through filling in of bulk goods. The cohesiveness of the adhesive 5 is of such a magnitude that the adhesive connection between the outer sack 2 and the inner sack 1 when the latter is pressed towards the yet uncovered pressure sensitive ad hesive 5 on the adhesive zones 4, 7, 8 at the termination of its expansion is capable of transferring the forces which the inner sack 3 is subjected to during the filling or emptying of the container 1 to the outer sack 2 . In this manner the inner sack is not torn loose from the outer sack.
