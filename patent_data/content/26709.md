# Poly alkylene oxide composition containing a nitro substituted aromatic compound.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to poly alkylene oxide compositions containing a nitro substituted aromatic compound. Poly alkylene oxide compositions which have incorporated therein an effective amount of a mono nuclear aromatic compound having at least one substituent nitro group, exhibit excellent resistance to oxidative degradation and inhibit the corrosion of ferrous metals.
