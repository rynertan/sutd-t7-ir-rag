# Ratio control mechanism for a variable ratio belt drive.

## Abstract
A variable ratio pulley type belt drive system has a pair of pulleys 44, 96 mounted on input and output shafts 14, 74 respectively and interconnected by a drive belt 96 . The pulleys are adjustably controlled in axial width to establish the drive ratio between the shafts. Each pulley has a load cam 32, 86 sensitive to the torque load being imposed on the respective shaft. The load cams are interconnected by a linkage 104 to 108 and a preload spring 40 which establishes the minimum axial force operable on the pulleys the linkage transmits forces between the pulleys, thereby imposing a tension force on the belt establishes by the greater of the forces generated at the load cams. A drive ratio selector 66 is connected to one side of the input pulley to add or substract a force so that the axial forces on the input and output pulleys are properly balanced when the desired drive ratio is established. The output shaft of the pulley system is connected by way of a starting mechanism to a forward reverse gear arrangement 120 and thence to a final drive and differential gear 134, 136 .
