# Mounting of filament assemblies in lamp units.

## Abstract
A mounting member for a filament assembly comprises a generally planar base portion 20 and a pair of projections 22 integral with the base portion, the projections 22 having cut outs 23 therein in which are received respectively a pair of mounting lugs L on a base B of the filament assembly. The projections 22 are deformed from positions shown in Figure 5 in which they are generally co planar with the base portion 20 and extend into an aperture 21 formed therein, and positions shown in Figure 4 in which they upstand from the base portion 20 and are of helical configuration. In their undeformed positions, the projections 22 overlap one another and are spaced apart transversely of their direction of extent. Thus, the length of the projections 22 is not limited by the size of the aperture 21 , which must accommodate the external cross section of the filament assembly base B therein.
