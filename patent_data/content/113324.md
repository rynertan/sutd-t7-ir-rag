# POLYVALENT MECHANISM FOR MAGNETIC RECORDERS AND PLAYERS WITH AUTOREVERSE

## Abstract
The instant invention relates to a polyvalent mechanism for magnetic recorders and players with autoreverse, i.e., apparatus in which the magnetic tape may be played by being wound in both directions without having to extract, turn over and reinsert the cassette. Said mechanism is capable of simultaneous carrying out all the kinematic operations necessary in order to reverse the direction in which the magnetic tape is being played.
