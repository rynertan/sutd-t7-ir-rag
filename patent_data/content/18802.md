# Process for preparing a piezoelectric pyroelectric film, and capacitors, piezoelectric and pyroelectric devices incorporating the film.

## Abstract
Previously, the piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of polyvinylidene fluoride type films prepared by simultaneously stretching and applying a voltage across the film have not been particularly marked. In order to overcome this problem a piezoelectric pyroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride type film is now prepared by stretching the film 1 between electrodes 3 whilst causing a corona discharge between the electrodes, to thereby polarize the film. The resultant films can be used in piezoelectric or pyroelectric devices or as a dielectric material in capacitors.
