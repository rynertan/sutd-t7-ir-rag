# Ferric nitrate treatment for nucleating graphite fibre growth by methane pyrolysis.

## Abstract
Graphite fibres are preferably grown by natural gas pyrolysis adjacent a stainless steel surface. Prior to said natural gas pyrolysis, the surface is pretreated by evaporating thereon a ferric nitrate solution to increase the yield of product fibres.
