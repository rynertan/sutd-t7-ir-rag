## Description
Terminations for optical fibersThis invention relates to terminations for optical fibers for use in star configured optical communication networks and, more particularly, to optical dividers for coupling a single light source to a plurality of fiber optic waveguides and to optical combiners for coupling a plurality of fiber optic waveguides to a single photodetector.Star configured network architectures have become increasingly popular for the distribution of optical communication signals because of their relatively low insertipn loss characteristics. There now are low loss couplers for such networks, such as the biconically tapered coupled described by Rawson and Nafarrate, Star Couplers UsingFused Biconically Tapered Multimode Fibers, Electronics Lerren, Vol. 14, No. 9, April 27, 1978, pp. 274 275 and by Rawson and Bailey, Bitaper Star Couplers with up to 100Fibre Channels, Electro,zks Levers, Vol. 15, No. 14, July 5, 1979, pp. 432 433. However, the optical combincrs and dividers that have been developed for such networks are relatively ineffident and complex. Sce, for example, New Tcchnology ExtendsDistributed Control Networks, Amp Designer Digest, No. 18, Anip Incorporated,Harrisburg. Pa, 1980, pp. 2 4.Optical combincrs and dividers are required, for example, in star rietworks which utilize active repeatering to boost the signal to noise ratio of the optical signal. At such a repeater, a photodetector converts the optical signal carried by a plurality of incoming fibers into a corresponding electrical signal which is then amplified and filtered i.c, repeatered .The repeatcred signal is, in turn, applied to a suitable light source, such as a laser or a light emitting diode LED , which reconverts it into an optical signal for return transmission to the stations or terminals on the network via a plurality of output fibers As will be appreciated, the net improvement in the signal to noise ratio of the repeatered optical signal is directly dependent on the optical efficicncy of the coupling between the light source and the output fibers i.e., the optical ciiiciency of the divider .Heretofore, it has been especially difficult to achieve adequate coupling efficiency when the light source is a high frequency LED because 1 a LED usually radiates over a solid angle of roughly i 900 and 2 a high frquency LED typically has an active area that is considerably smaller than the cross sectional area of a plurality of bundled output fiberOf course, it is also important that there be efficient coupling of the incoming fibers to the photodetcctor i.e., an optically efficient combiner of such a repeatering station.As a general rule, that requirement. can be met by simply gathering all of the incoming fibers into a bundle and by using a photodetector which is suffidently large to accept light from all of bundlcd fibers. If however, a smaller photodctcctor is required to, say, obtain a better high frequency response characteristic, an alternative approach may be required to provide the necessary combiner efficiency.Reliability is another critically important issue in designing active repeater stations and the like for optical communication networks. Preferably, there is sufficient redundancy to sustain the network in the face of a failure of a component, such as a light source. See, Strcifer. Scifres and Burnham, Redundancy in Diode Laser Applications, XeroxDisclosure Journal, VoL S, No. 4, July August 1980, pp. 399 400.In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a uniconically tapered termination which may be used as a dividerlcombiner for efficiently coupling star configured optical communication networks to light sources and photodetectors.In keeping with one of the more detailed aspects of the invention, a plurality of redundant light sources are coupled to a star configured optical communications network by separate uniconically tapered dividers which feed into a biconically tapered coupler so that the network can continue to function even should one of the light sources fail.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a side view of a uniconically tapered optical divider constructed in accordance with this invention Figure 2 is an enlarged and simplified side view of the divider shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is an side view of a redundant input for a optical communication network embodying uniconically tapered optical dividers andFigure 4 is a side view of a uniconically tapered optical combiner embodying the present inventionTurning now to the drawings, and at this point especially to Figure 1, there is a uniconically tapered divider 11 for coupling a light source, such as a LED 12, to a plurality of optical output fibers 13a 13j within a star configured optical communications network 14.Typically, the fibers 13 13i are more or less conventionally clad, single strand, multi mode optical fibers having either a graded or a step index profile. The LED 12 may, for example, be the light source of an active repeater station 15 shown only in relevant part for the network 14. In accordance with the present invention, the divider 11 is a fused and tapered termination of the fibers I3 13j. Preferably, the fibers 13a l3i are wound or twisted about a common center and placed under tension whs being thermally fused together, whereby the region or segment of the fibers 13a 13i that is softened during the fusion process elongates with a conical taper. For example, the divider 11 may be fabricated by fist forming a biconically tapered coupler through the use of most any of the known processes for fabricating such a coupler and by then severing the biconical coupler at its waist it., along its section of minimum diameter . The light source 12 typically is butt coupled to the divider 11 to inject light into the fibers 13a 13i. For that reason, the input face 16 of the divider 11 preferably is selected to have an area that is substantially equal to the effective emission area of the light source 12. If, as previously assumed, the light source 12 is a LED, light will radiate therefrom over a solid angle of approximately i9O0. Thus, it is important that the divider 11 have a wide acceptance angle.Referring to Figure 2, the internal acceptance angle of the divider 11 may be calculated to a first approximation by applying Snell s Law to determine the critical angle of incidence, c cl s for total internal refection TIR from the cladding surrounding environment interface of the divider 11 0c cl s sin 1 ns ncp 1 where ns the refactive index of the surrounding environment, and nCl the refractive index of the cladding 17. Assuming that the divider 11 is surrounded by air ns 1 and that the refractive index of the cladding 17 is 1.47, the critical angle of incidence, ec cs can be shown to be approximately 429 . The internal acceptance angle, alpha c cl s of the divider 11 is the angle about the central axis of the divider 11 within which light is guided by TIR and is given by alpha c cl s II 2 c cl s . Thus, for the case assumed above, the internal acceptance, angle alpha c cl s is approximately i47.10. This compares very favorably to the usual internal acceptancet angle of only jIO0 or so for a single fiber that is butt coupled to a light source it being understood that light is guided in such a standard butt coupled fiber by TIR from the core cladding interface, even though the refractive index difference thereacross is significantly smaller than across the cladding air interface. indeed, based on the ratio of the squares of the critical angles of incidence, it can be shown that the solid angle of the internal acceptance cone of the divider 11 is roughly sixteen times greater than the acceptance cone angle of a single fiber butt coupled to a light source.Due to the uniconical taper of the divider 11, most of the light that is captured or guided by the cladding 17 is transformed to shallower angles so that it may be captured by the cores 18a 18j of the fibers 13a 13i. The criticai angle of incidence, C co cl for total internal reflectance from the core cladding interface can be determined by modifying the terms of equation 1 as follows ec co cl sin ncl nco where n, the refactive index of the cores 18a18j. As before. the internal acceptance angle, ac co cl . for the cores 18a 18j is given by ac co cl i II 2 . c co cl 4 Accordingly, if it is assumed that the refractive index of the cores 18a 18i is 1.48 and that the refractive index of the cladding 17 is 1.47 as previously stated , equation 4 can be solved to show that the internal acceptance angle, aeokl for nR from the core cladding interface, is approximately i 6.66 . Preferably, the transformation of the cladding guided light into a core guided mode is relatively graduaL To that end, the taper of the divider 11 is selected so that the cladding guided light experiences multiple reflections from the cladding air interface at progressively decreasing angles as it propogates into the divider 11.Thus, only a portion of the cladding guided light is at a sufficiently shallow angle of incidence relative to the core cladding interface to be captured by the cores 18a 181 at any given point along the length of the divider 1L but the balance of the cladding guided light is captured at other points along the divider 11 after experiencing one or more additional reflections. In practice, the taper 21 may, as shown, extend somewhat beyond the fused region 22 of the divider 15 into the branching or discrete region of the fibers 13a 13j. Consequently, it should be understood that the transformation of light from a cladding guided mode to a core guided mode may occur anywhere within the tapered region 21.Turning to Figure 3, in keeping with one of the more detailed aspects of the present invention, a plurality of uniconically tapered dividers llA and 113 may be used to couple redundant light sources 12A and 12B in parallel to a star configured communications network 31. A biconicaily tapered coupler 32 couples light from any one or more of the sources 12A and 12B into the output fibers 32 32j of the network 31. To that end, the input fibers of the coupler 32 are divided into separate groups 13Aa13Ai and 13Ba 13Bi which are terminated by the dividers 11A and llB. respectively. Moreover, the light sources 12A and 12B are butt coupled to the faces 16d and 16B of dividers liA and llB, respectively. Upper case alphabetic suffixes have been added to the reference numerals to emphasize the parallism of this embodiment Otherwise, however, like refcrcnce numerals have been used to identify like parts because the dividers llA and 113 are similar in construction and operation to the previously described divider 11 Figures 1 and 2 . The redundant light sources 12A and 12B may. for example, be output sources of an active repeater station 34 shown only in relevant part . For that application, the light sources 12 and 12S may be operated at a reduced, say, one half, output power Icvel under normal opertating conditions. Furthermore, a controller 35 monitors the operation of the sources 12A and 12B. such as by detecting the intensity of the uncaptured radiation 36A and 36B therefrom.Consequently, should any one of the light sourceS such as the light source 12N fail, the controller 35 appropriately increascs the output power of the other source or sources 12B to, say a fufl output power level, so that communication network 31 continues to operate without interruption while the source 12A is being replaced.Alternatively, of course the source 128, could be operated at full power, and the other source na could then serve as a backup to be cnergized in response to a signal from the controller 35 if the source 12A should happen to failReferring to Figure 4, in keeping with still another aspect of the present invention, a uniconically tapered combiner 41 may be used to terminate a plurality of fibers 42an421 so that a single photodetector 43 can accept light from all of the fibers 42a 42i As will be appreciated, the combiner 41 is the output equivalent of the above described divider 11 and, therefore, need not be described in any further detaiL In view of the foregoing, it will now be understood that the present invention provides a uniconical termination for the optical fibers of an optical communication network. The termination may be used as a divider or as a combiner for coupling a light source or a photodetcctor. respectively. to the fibers of such a network. Moreover, the termination is particularly weR suited for use with a biconically tapered coupler to provide parallel inputs or outputs for such a network.
