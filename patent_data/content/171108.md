# DC AC converter for feeding a metal vapour discharge tube.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a DC AC converter 30 to 72 for feeding a low pressure mercury vapour discharge tube 15 . The converter comprises two series connected main transistors 11 and 20 which in the operating condition are alternately con ducting. According to the invention, the conduction times of the two transistors 11 and 20 are always kept equal to each other by means of an auxiliary circuit 70 to 72, 32a, 32b, 32c , whereby the operation of the timing circuit 32, 33 is influenced. Thus, inter alia no cataphoresis occurs in the lamp 15 .
