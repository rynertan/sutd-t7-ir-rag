## Description
This invention relates to a purified β type transforming growth factor in the form of a homogeneous protein and to a method for its production as well as to compositions comprising this purified β type transforming growth factor, and to the use of such compositions for producing a medicine. There is a continuing need for the promotion of rapid cell proliferation at the site of wounds, burns, diabetic and decubitus ulcers, and other traumata. A number of growth factors are known which promote the rapid growth of animal cells. These growth factors include epidermal growth factor EGF , transforming growth factors TGF s and nerve growth factor NGF . Many new peptide growth factors have been isolated and characterized recently, as indicated in The term, transforming growth factor TGF has been defined to include the set of polypeptides which confer the transformed phenotype on untransformed indicator cells. The transformed phenotype is operationally defined by the loss of density dependent inhibition of growth in monolayer, overgrowth in monolayer, characteristic change in cellular morphology, and acquisition of anchorage independence, with the resultant ability to grow in soft agar. Untransformed, non neoplastic cells will not form progressively growing colonies in soft agar, while the property of anchorage independent growth of cells in culture has a particularly high correlation with neoplastic growth Although TGFs were first discovered in the conditioned medium of virally transformed neoplastic mouse cells, the application of the acid ethanol method for extraction of peptides from tissues has now shown that TGFs can be found in almost all tissues, both neoplastic and non neoplastic, from all species of animals that have been examined thus far. Although TGF activity is usually measured with an The initial description of sarcoma growth factor SGF , the first of the TGFs to be isolated, was an important finding in tumor cell biology since it provided a direct mechanism for the expression of the neoplastic phenotype in a virally transformed cell. Two important properties of SGF were described in these earliest studies, namely 1 that the effects of SGF in causing phenotypic transformation were dependent on its continued presence, and that these effects were Since the discovery of SGF in 1978, many TGFs have been described from diverse sources. These TGFs can be categorized into two groups extracellular TGFs isolated from conditioned media of cultured cells, and intracellular cell associated TGFs isolated by direct extraction of cells or tissues. Although extracellular TGFs have recently been isolated from non neoplastic murine cells, use of conditioned medium has, in general, been restricted to neoplastic cell lines that could be grown in long term, large scale culture, including certain virally and chemically transformed rodent cells and human tumor cell lines. The adaptation of an acid ethanol extraction procedure to TGF isolation removed all limitations on cell types and quantities of tissues that could be examined. Using this procedure, extracts of all tissues or cells, whether of neoplastic or non neoplastic origin, whether from adult or embryonic tissue, whether from human, bovine, or murine genomes, have been shown to promote colony formation in a soft agar assay hence, by definition, these extracts contain TGF activity. A variety of both epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines form colonies in soft agar in the presence of TGFs. However, the most commonly used indicator cell line is the rat kidney fibroblast cell clone, NRK 49F, which has been selected for its strong colony forming response to the TGFs. Rat 1 cells and mouse AKR 2B cells have also been used successfully as indicator cells. All of the TGFs referred to above are low molecular weight polypeptides which share with SGF the physical properties of acid and heat stability and sensitivity to treatment with both trypsin and dithiothreitol. However, there are marked differences in the biological properties of these TGFs, particularly with respect to their relationship to EGF. Certain TGFs, though antigenically distinct from EGF, have some structural homology to EGF, since they compete with EGF for receptor binding. Other TGFs do not compete with EGF for receptor binding, but instead are dependent on EGF for activity in the soft agar assay for colony formation. To remove the ambiguities implicit in the assignment of the general term TGF to these different factors, an operational classification of the members of the TGF family based on their interactions with EGF is suggested, both with respect to competition for binding to the EGF receptor and to the requirement for EGF for induction of colonies in soft agar. As defined for purposes of this invention, TGF α are those TGFs which compete with EGF for receptor binding and which do not require EGF for the induction of colony formation in soft agar. TGFs with these properties include SGF and other TGFs derived from neoplastic cells, as well as some TGFs from mouse embryos. As defined for purposes of this invention, TGF β are those TGFs which do not compete with EGF for receptor binding and which require EGF for the induction of colony growth in soft agar. When assayed in the presence of EGF, TGF β represents the major colony forming activity of the intracellular TGFs of both neoplastic and non neoplastic cell lines and tissues. It can be assumed that TGF β will be found in conditioned media as well, once the proper assays are used. Those TGFs which do not compete with EGF for receptor binding and which do not require EGF for colony formation are designated TGF γ gamma type TGF . Such TGFs have been described in conditioned media of certain virally or chemically transformed cells. Finally, TGF δ delta type TGF is used to specify those TGFs which would both compete for EGF receptors and require EGF for colony formation in soft agar. EGF itself could be classified as a weak TGF δ. The state of the art shows that there were made several attempts to isolate and purify beta type transforming growth factors TGF β , nevertheless none of these prior attempts has been useful to produce TGF β in the form of a homogeneous purified protein pure enough to be usable for preparing a pharmaceutical composition. The article by A. B. Roberts et al in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 78, No. 9, September 1981, pages 5339 5343 New class of transforming growth factors potentiated by epidermal growth factor Isolation from non neoplastic tissues describes the production of a protein preparation which has a purification degree of the 2,200 fold of the crude extract and about the 22,000 fold based on the original tissues. The article by A. B. Roberts et al in Nature, vol. 295, February 4, 1982, pages 417 419 Macmillan Journals Ltd. Isolation from murine sarcoma cells of novel transforming growth factors potentiated by EGF describes a purification method similar to the method of the above mentioned reference which is used for isolating two different growth factors, i.e. TGF α and TGF β, from murine sarcoma cells. In this case too, no purified homogeneous protein could be obtained, it was rather only possible to obtain two different fractions of the two different transformation growth factors. The article by A. B. Roberts et al in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 77, No. 6, June 1980, pages 3494 3498 Transforming growth factors Isolation of polypeptides from virally and chemically transformed cells by acid ethanol extraction also describes the isolation of two different polypeptide fractions having an apparent molecular weight of 7,000 and 10,000 from murine sarcoma. From the statements at page 3494, left hand column, first part abstract and the discussion at page 3498, it may be seen that the authors of this article admit that they could not obtain a purified product proof of the chemical and structural relatedness of these peptides must await further purification... page 3498, left hand column, second paragraph . Similarly, the abstract of this article shows that only a 22,000 fold purification could be achieved. An article by M.A. Anzano et al in Anal. Biochem. 1982, 125 1 , pages 217 24 confirms the fact that all prior art methods resulted in a certain purification but were, however, not able to isolate a homogeneous protein. According to said article the last purification step of the method described there resulted in only a 430 fold purification. The latter reference is based on experiments carried out by the inventors of the present patent application. It was found only later by the present inventors that the preparation described there was not TGF β and that the stated reference does not provide a teaching enabling the average skilled man to isolate TGF β in the form of a homogeneous, purified protein. Considering the above described state of the art it is the objective of the present invention to provide a β type transforming growth factor in extremely high purity sufficient for the pharmaceutical use. The subject matter of the present invention is a purified β type transforming growth factor in the form of a homogeneous protein, susceptible to Edman degradative amino acid sequencing which is obtainable by the steps of extracting murine, human or bovine cells or tissues with acid ethanol to produce a cell extract, dialysing the cell extract to produce a dialysed acid ethanol extract, applying the dialysed acid ethanol extract to a gel filtration chromotography column and eluting with 1M acetic acid to obtain a gel filtration eluate, adding the gel filtration eluate to a reverse phase HPLC C₁₈ column using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1 triflucroacetic acid to produce a C₁₈ eluate, applying the C₁₈ eluate to a CN reverse phase HPLC column using a n propanol gradient in 0.1 trifluoroacetic acid to obtain a CN eluate, and recovering from the CN eluate a sequencible TGF β that runs as a 12,500 13,000 dalton molecular weight protein on a reducing SDS PAGE gel and a 25,000 26,000 dalton molecular weight protein on a non reducing SDS PAGE gel. The present invention furthermore concerns a process for preparing the said purified beta type transforming growth factor, comprising the above described process steps. This invention further provides a composition for the promotion of cell proliferation and tissue repair whose active ingredient consists essentially of the above defined β type transforming growth factor TGF β in amounts sufficient to promote cell proliferation. Preferably such composition further comprises as an additional ingredient at least one activating agent present in an amount sufficient to activate said TGF β, wherein the activating agent is selected from the group consisting of epidermal growth factor EGF and α type transforming growth factor TGF α . Active ingredients are present in an amount sufficient to promote cell proliferation. The present invention furthermore comprises the use of the above stated composition for the production of a medicine having a utility in the treatment of mammalian systemic traumata by systemic administration. In the compositions the TGF β and the activating agent are preferably present in about equimolar amounts, and the active ingredients are present in an amount at least sufficient to stimulate cell proliferation tissue repair . As another embodiment, the activated TGF β compositions of this invention may be admixed with other secondary growth factors to enhance their activity. The compositions may be formulated in any suitable carrier for topical application, such as physiological saline solution or purified collagen suspension. The compositions also may be formulated in any suitable carrier for systemic administration. The method of topical administration of the compositions of this invention is by direct application to a burn, wound, or other traumata situs. Periodic or continual further administration may be preferably indicated in most instances, since the active ingredients are physiologically utilized by the cells whose growth is being stimulated. As a further embodiment, the compositions of this invention may be administered systemically by injection, enterally, transdermal patches, and the like, depending upon the nature and site of the traumata to be treated. Research in our laboratory has been directed toward the isolation of TGFs directly from cells and tissues. An acid ethanol extraction procedure was modified for this purpose, as disclosed in A. B. Roberts, et al., TGF α from MSV transformed 3T3 cells resembles SGF isolated from the conditioned medium of the same cells and other TGFs isolated from rat and human tumor cell lines. Recently, SGF and the TGF α s from the conditioned media of a human melanoma cell line and virally transformed rat embryo fibroblast have been purified to homogeneity. The human melanoma TGF α is a single chain polypeptide of molecular weight 7,400. Its amino acid composition and chromatographic behavior are markedly different from that of human EGF, but similar to that of murine SGF and rat TGF α, suggesting that TGF α s from human, rat and mouse genomes are more closely related to each other than to EGF. There is therefore a reasonable possibility that TGF α s may have cross species utility. In sarcoma virus transformed rodent cell lines, the release of TGF α into the medium has been correlated with the expression of the transformed phenotype, and within a selected set of human tumor cell lines that release TGF α, the ability of the tumor cells to grow in soft agar has been correlated with the quantity of TGF α they secrete. However, secretion of TGF α is not an absolute requirement for neoplastic behavior certain chemically transformed murine cell lines and human lung carcinoma cell lines that do not secrete TGF α release strong TGF activity that does not compete with EGF for receptor binding. TGF β of the acid ethanol extract of the MSV transformed 3T3 cells resembles other TGFs isolated from many neoplastic and non neoplastic tissues. After further purification on a second HPLC column, TGF β of the MSV transformed cells eluted at the same position in the Through a combination of techniques, TGF β from bovine kidneys was purified 200,000 fold to the point of homogeniety. Samples of homogenous TGF β 20 50 pmol were taken to dryness and hydrolyzed in sealed, evacuated tubes at 150 C for 2 hours in 100 µl constant boiling HCl containing 0.1 liquid phenol. Half cystine and methionine were determined by performic acid oxidation followed by acid hydrolysis. Analyses of For amino terminal sequence analysis, approximately 500 picomoles M Automated Edman degradation was performed on about 500 pmoles M The following table summarizes the amino acid distribution. Analysis of the bovine kidney TGF β by electrophoresis on NaDodSO₄ polyacrylamide gels suggests that some of the disulfide bonds are inter chain. Comparison of the above results with those obtained by the analysis of TGF β from human placenta or human platelets revealed no significant differences in the respective amino acid compositions, and it is anticipated that the N terminal sequences will be very similar. Amino acid sequence analysis of the reduced and S carboxymethylated bovine kidney TGF β by automated Edman degradation using a gas phase sequencer revealed a single N terminal amino acid sequence as follows, CMC is S carboxymethylcysteine Initial and repetitive yields were found to be equal to the yields calculated for myoglobin used as standard protein. At the minimum, the results indicate that the sequence of at least the first fifteen N terminal amino acids of each of the two subunits of TGF β is identical and confirm the observations of a single protein band of the reduced TGF β on NaDodSO₄ polyacrylamide gels. In addition, the N terminal sequence of the bovine kidney TGF β is identical to the partial sequence of TGF β from human placenta, suggesting a high degree of relatedness of type β TGFs from different species and different tissue sources. Recent experiments in our laboratory have shown that either TGF α or EGF will activate TGF β to induce the formation of large colonies in soft agar. Purified TGF β from the MSV transformed 3T3 cells, assayed by itself, had no colony forming activity at concentrations as high as 2 µg ml. However, assayed after activation by the presence of either EGF, or TGF α derived from the same cells, TGF β induced a dose dependent formation of large colonies 3,100 µm² at concentrations of 10 200 ng ml. By contrast, EGF or TGF α, assayed by themselves, induced a maximal response of only a small number of colonies this response was increased 10 fold by the addition of TGF β. The relative abilities of EGF and TGF α to promote TGF β dependent formation of large colonies in soft agar correlated with their relative abilities to compete for binding to the EGF receptor other experiments using chemically modified EGF analogues have substantiated this correlation. These data, demonstrating that the induction of a strong colony forming response requires both TGF α and TGF β or EGF, suggest that TGF β, which is found in all tissues, may be an essential mediator of the effects of TGF α and of EGF on neoplastic transformation. Little is known about the mechanisms by which exogenous TGFs induce non neoplastic cells to express the transformed phenotype. Furthermore, the synergistic interactions of TGF α and TGF β suggest that these two TGFs may act through different pathways. Experiments using TGFs of conditioned media of sarcoma virus transformed rodent cells have shown that the synthesis of new RNA and protein is required before transformation occurs. Other experiments have been directed at a possible role of TGFs in phosphorylation reactions. Certain viral transforming gene products and their normal cellular homologues have tyrosine specific protein kinase activity, and it has been proposed that phosphorylation at tyrosine of specific substrates may be important in the transformation process. Treatment of human carcinoma A431 cells with various TGFs derived from conditioned media of virally transformed cells or human tumor cell lines TGF α resulted in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the 160 K EGF receptor. The pattern of phosphorylation, however, was indistinguishable from that induced by EGF itself, and thus would not appear to be transformation specific. Likewise, dissolution of actin fibers of Rat 1 cells occurs when they are treated with either TGF or EGF. It is clear that further research is needed to establish the relationships of the TGFs to the retrovirus transforming gene products and the mode of action of the TGFs in neoplastic transformation. The following are summaries of examples which illustrate various aspects of this invention After the above The examples which follow demonstrate not only that the compositions according to this invention are effective Following chromatography on Bio Gel P 30, the bovine TGF β were purified further by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography HPLC on µBondapak C18 columns using an acetonitrile gradient in 0.1 percent trifluoroacetic acid, followed by a second HPLC step on µBondapak CN columns using a gradient of The rats respond to these chambers as if they were wounds, and eventually the chambers become filled with fibroblasts and collagen. By the fourth day after insertion, the chambers become encapsulated with connective tissue, but there are few cells within the chambers themselves. There is thus a defined, enclosed space within the chambers, where a wound healing response can be quantitatively measured. At this time, daily injections of TGF β 0.1 ml, in sterile phosphate buffered saline into chambers A, B, and C were begun. To activate TGF β activity, a low level of murine EGF was included in all TGF β injections, unless noted otherwise. Chambers D, E, and F were used as controls, and were injected with either an amount of bovine serum albumin BSA alone or in combination with either TGF β or EGF, such that the total protein was equivalent to the amount of TGF β injected into chambers A, B, and C. Injections were made once daily for either 5 days Table 2 or 9 days Table 3 . All injected materials were sterile. The rats were sacrificed 6 hours after the last TGF β injection in Table 3 they were injected with 0.5 mCi of thymidine ³H, specific activity 6.7 Ci millimole i.p. together with the last TGF β injection. The chambers were removed from the rats, all connective tissue on the outside of the wire mesh was peeled away, and then the contents of each chamber were determined. Table 3 shows that 5 days of treatment of rats with TGF β from either bovine salivary gland or bovine kidney caused a significant increase in total protein in the treated chambers, as compared to control chambers treated with an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin Experiments 1, 3 . The salivary gland TGF β was still highly active after two steps of purification by the high pressure liquid chromatography Experiment 2 . The effects observed are not the sole result of the minute amounts of EGF which had been used to potentiate the activity of TGF β, since a highly significant difference between treated chambers A, B and C, compared to control chambers D, E and F was still observed when EGF was used as the control substance Experiment 4 . Furthermore, when all chambers were treated with TGF β, and only A, B, and C were treated with EGF, no significant difference was observed Experiment 5 . At the end of Experiments 1 4, it was consistently observed that chambers A, B and C were more firmly fixed in the surrounding connective tissue than the respective matched control chambers, suggesting that effects of the TGF β also were manifested in the area immediately surrounding the chambers. In order to measure the effects of bovine salivary TGF β on DNA and collagen content of the chambers, it was necessary to treat the animals for longer than 5 days. Table 4 shows the results of a larger experiment in which 13 rats were treated for 9 days. The increases in total protein, total DNA, thymidine incorporation into DNA, and total collagen were all highly sufficient. Histological examination of the contents of the chambers treated with TGF β confirmed the occurrence of fibroblastic proliferation and formation of collagen. A sterile infiltrate of inflammatory cells was also found within both treated and control chambers. The results obtained in both experiments indicate that TGF βs when activated in accordance with this invention, can significantly accelerate a wound healing response. The compositions of this invention, whose active ingredients are TGF β activated by at least one of a TGF α and an EGF, can reasonably be expected to have clinical use in the treatment of animals, particularly mammals, most particularly human beings. There are several sound bases for this conclusion. It has been shown above, that in The Two types of application of the compositions of this invention are contemplated. The first, and preferred, application is topically for the promotion of surface wound healing. There are no limitations as to the type of wound or other traumata that can be treated, and these include but are not limited to first, second and third degree burns especially second and third degree surgical incisions, including those of cosmetic surgery wounds, including lacerations, incisions, and penetrations and surface ulcers including decubital bed sores , diabetic, dental, haemophiliac, and varicose. Although the primary concern is the healing of major wounds by fibroblast cell regeneration, it is contemplated that the compositions may also be useful for minor wounds, and for cosmetic regeneration of cells such as epithelial. It is also contemplated that the compositions may be utilized by the topical application to internal surgical incisions. When applied topically, the compositions may be combined with other ingredients, such as carriers and or adjuvants. There are no limitations on the nature of such other ingredients, except that they must be pharmaceutically acceptable, efficacious for their intended administration, and cannot degrade the activity of the active ingredients of the compositions. When the compositions of this invention are applied to burns, they may be in the form of an irrigant, preferably in combination with physiological saline solution. The compositions can also be in the form of ointments or suspensions, preferably in combination with purified collagen. The compositions also may be impregnated into transdermal patches, plasters, and bandages, preferably in a liquid or semi liquid form. The second application is systemically for the healing of internal wounds and similar traumata. Such an application is useful provided that there are no, or limited, undesirable side effects, such as the stimulation of neoplastic cellular growth. When applied systemically, the compositions may be formulated as liquids, pills, tablets, lozonges, or the like, for enteral administration, or in liquid form for parenteral injection. The active ingredients may be combined with other ingredients such as carriers and or adjuvants. There are no limitations on the nature of such other ingredients, except that they must be pharmaceutically acceptable, efficacious for their intended administration, and cannot degrade the activity of the active ingredients of the compositions. The amount of activating agent TGF αs or EGFs present depends directly upon the amount of TGF βs present in the activated compositions of this invention. There are indications that the activation is not catalytic in nature, and that therefore approximately stoichiometric equimolar quantities are preferred. The amount of activated composition to be used in the methods of this invention cannot be stated because of the nature of the activity of TGFs and the nature of healing wounds and or other traumata. As indicated above, the TGFs activate cells by binding to receptor sites on the cells, after which the TGFs are absorbed and utilized by the cells for the synthesis of new protein, resulting in cell multiplication. Thus, the TGFs are consumed by the cell regenerating process itself, rather than acting in an enzymatic or other catalytic manner. Receptors for EGFs have been found on a wide variety of fibroblastic, epithelial, and parietal cells, as disclosed in Gonzalez, et al., Since the compositions of this invention both provoke and sustain cellular regeneration, a continual application or periodic reapplication of the compositions in indicated. The amount of active ingredient per unit volume of combined medication for administration is also very difficult to specify, because it depends upon the amount of active ingredients that are afforded directly to the regenerating cells of the wound or other traumata situs. However, it can generally be stated that the TGF βs should preferably be present in an amount of at least about 1.0 nanogram per milliliter of combined composition, more preferably in an amount up to about 1.0 milligram per milliliter. In addition to utilizing the activated TGF β compositions of this invention by themselves, it is possible to use them in combination with secondary growth factors. The activated transforming growth factors of this invention may be physically admixed with one or more of many other secondary peptide and non peptide growth factors. Such admixtures may be administered in the same manner and for the same purposes as the activated transforming growth factors of this invention utilized alone, to enhance their activity in promoting cell proliferation and repair. The useful proportions of activated transforming growth factor to secondary growth factors are 1 .1 10 mols, with about equimolar amounts being preferred. The secondary growth factors may be used alone or in any physiologically and pharmaceutically compatible combination. The known secondary growth factors, in approximately descending order of usefulness in this invention by group , include In addition to the above known secondary growth factors, it is reasonable to expect that as yet undiscovered secondary growth factors will be useful in admixture. This invention also incorporates the inactive intermediate substance TGF β It is believed that TGF β has no wound healing or other tissue repair activity unless it has been activated by an agent as described above. However, it is noted that Table 3 Experiment 5, Thus, the results of Experiment 5 are not inconsistent with this invention, but instead constitute a variant embodiment thereof. Specifically, TGF β
