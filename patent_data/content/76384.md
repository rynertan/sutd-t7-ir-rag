# Bearing mounting with hydraulic fastening means for cranes and the like.

## Abstract
An apparatus, such as a crane, having a bearing 18 for rotatably connecting two structures 14,16 and transmitting radial, axial, rotational and moment forces from one to the other. The bearing 18 is separably mounted to one of the structures 16 by threaded fasteners, e.g., bolts 44 , having piston means 46 associated with the fasteners 44 with the hydraulic system being pressurized during operation to establish proper uniform preloading of the fasteners 44 for transmitting the load forces from one structure to the other.
