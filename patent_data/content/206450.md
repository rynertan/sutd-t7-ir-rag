# Deformation sensitive electroconductive knitted or woven fabric and deformation sensitive electroconductive device comprising the same.

## Abstract
The deformation sensitive electroconductive knitted or woven fabric of the present invention is a knitted or woven fabric, which can be changed in electroconductivity at the deformed portion when the deformation of stretch or com pression is applied thereon by maintaining at a certain va lue the ratio of the number of electrically insulating portions to the number of electroconductive portions at the inter twined portions of the fibers and or the portions between the intertwined portions of the fibers. By using this knitted or woven fabric directly or a deformation sensitive electrocon ductive sheet having an elastomer laminated on at least one surface of the knitted or woven fabric, the latter can be uti lized as a stretch sensitive electroconductive device or pressure sensitive electroconductive device provided with electrodes and capable of detecting the changes in electro conductivity corresponding to deformations as electrical characteristics such as electrical resistance. This deforma tion sensitive electroconductive device is highly effective in the measurement of large deformations and in durability in repeated use as compared with the pressure sensitive elec troconductive device using a pressure sensitive electrocon ductive elastomer sheet mixed with electroconductive fil lers which has been used in the prior art.
