# Sheet measuring apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for measuring a property of a traveling sheet 10 comprises a sensor body 16, 30, 64 and a target body 14, 20 adapted to be located on opposite sides of the sheet and constrained e.g., by gas bearings formed between 32 and 36 and 38 during the measurement without substan tial solid bodily contact for movement along respective portions of a mutual sensor path intersecting the path of the sheet. Means 44, 46, 48, 56, 64, 70, 72, 74, 76 effective without substantial solid bodily contact normally maintain each of the sensor and target bodies at respective, substan tially constant distances from the opposite, nominal surfaces of the sheet while permitting the movement of the bodies along the sensor path in response to the position and thickness of the sheet between the nominal surfaces. Sheet property sensing means, including means 18, 84, 94, 118 aboard the sensor body and means 20 aboard the target body interact through the sheet to produce aboard the sensor body a response dependent on the sheet property and produce, without solid bodily connections, manifesta tions of the sheet property dependent response at a location at 96 spaced from the sensor body. Means 24, 96 including means 196 at the spaced location detect the manifestations and produce at 26 a sheet property indicative response.
