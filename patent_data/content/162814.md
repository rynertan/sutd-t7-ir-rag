## Description
A plant for transforming the hydraulic energy of a differential of hydrostatic level of a water stream into a form of utilizable energy. SPECIFICATION Background of the invention 1. Field of the inventionThe present invention relates to a plant for transforming the energy of hydraulic fall in water streams into a different form of energy that may be used for a practical purpose, such as mechanical energy or the lift of water to a level higher than that of the water stream. 2. Description of the prior artHydrostatic pressure air compressors are well known in the art, these being devices comprising a tubular body extending from the level of a sheet of water down to the interior of a bell placed near the bottom of a well in communication with deep water, so that the air in the bell is at the pressure of the water in depth.In conventional plants where a hydrostatic pressure air compressor is used, the liquid of the water stream discharges itself into said tubular body through its inlet aperture that is provided with a throttling section created by an air diffuser that sucks air at the atmospheric pressure, that is mixed with the water and is entrained towards the interior of said bell, where the air is compressed up to the pressure created by the water head in said well.The compressed air, separated from water is collected at the top of said bell wherefrom it may be collected through a suitable manifold for its utilization, for instance for powering a pneumatic machine or for lifting water by means of a conventional emulsion genera tion unit, i.e an air injection pump.The above mentioned devices are devices without moving mechanical parts and they are suitable for the exploi tation of the hydraulic energy provided by moderate level differences in water streams.The installation and operation costs of these devices is very low and the plants designed in this way are capable of providing low cost energy from a natural source having a cost practically of zero.However these devices of the known art have a very low energy transformation efficiency. Generally this is not an inconvenience, since the primary energy source has a practically zero cost. It would be however very desiderable that the overall energy efficiency be in creased.The applicant has already obtained improvements in the hydraulic efficiency of devices of the kind of hydrostatic pressure air compressor and air injection pump, as described in published italian patent appli cations no. 86001 A 80 and 86003 A 80.

Brief Description of the DrawingsThe present invention will be better disclosed herein after with reference to preferred embodiments, referred to as a non limitative example, with reference to the attached drawings, wherein figure 1 is a partially sectional schematical view of a plant according to the prior art where several kinds of utiYization are shown figure 2 is view similar to figure 1 of a plant according to the present invention for powering a pneumatic machine figure 3 is a view similar to those of the preceding figures of a plant according to the present invention for lifting water and figure 4 is a detailed view, partially sectioned, of the bulb of the diffuser located in the air compressor. Description of the Preferred EmbodimentsWith reference to figure 1, there is indicated with 1 a hydrostatic pressure compressor comprising a verti cal tubular body 2 the lower terminal end of which is sealingly inserted at the interior of a bell 3 located in proximity of the bottom of a well 4. As it will be remarked in figure 1 the compressor 1 is of the kind disclosed and claimed in another patent of the same applicant published italian application no.86001 A 80 wherein the tubular body 2 has a continuously decreasing horizontal sectional area from the top towards the bottom, for accomodating the sub sequent reductions of the volume of the air while it is being compressed in the drag towards the bottom of the well 4 and for imparting a constant speed to the descending mixture of air and water.The inlet aperture of the tubular body 2 is connected in fluid communication with the bottom end of a conduit 5 that extends with a certain slope starting from the level of a dam 6 arranged for providing a small waterfall in the water stream 7, the upper end of the conduit 5 being in communication with the water upstream of the dam 6.Through said bottom end of the conduit 5 a diffuser 8 is placed coaxially with the tubular body 2 of the hydrostatic compressor 1, the upper end of which com municates with the atmosphere, while the lower end extends into the inlet aperture of the tubular body 2, ending in a part enlarged as a bulb 9 provided with a plurality of holes and arranged for throttling the inlet aperture of the tubular body 2 in the tanner that will be explained hereinafter.During the operation, the water upstream of the dam 6 enters into the conduit 5 through said upper end and thanks to its slope runs downstream up to discharge into the inlet aperture of the tubular body 2 of the hydrostatic compressor 1. Because of the throttling action by the bulb 9 of the diffuser 8, there is crea ted, by Venturi effect, a negative pressure in the inlet aperture of the tubular body 2 that sucks exter nal air through the diffuser 8 and the bulb 9 provided with a plurality of holes. There will be formed conse quently a mixture or emulsion of water and air in which this latter, in the downward entrainment along the tu bular body 2, will be progressively compressed down to the depth of the bell 3 in the well 4. The final value of the pressure will be defined by the hydrosta tic head difference between the level of water in the bell 3 and the level of the waterstream 7 downstream with respect to the dam 6.In the bell 3 the air water mixture separates itself in compressed air and water and while the first one rises and stagnates in the volume of the bell 3, the second one overflows from the well 4 into the water stream 7. The compressed air collected in the bell 3 may be uti lized through a manifold 10, one end of which is con nected in fluid tight fluid communication with the top of the bell 3.In figure 1 there are shown a few examples of utilization of the compressed air built up by means of the hydrostatic compressor, examples that will be briefly discussed without going too much into detail.In a first example in the plant a pneumatic compressor unit is arranged, generally shown in 15 comprising a powering turbine and a compression turbine.The compressed air from the manifold 10 through the branching 16 in supplied to the motor turbine of the unit 15 powering it. Said motor, turbine operates in its turn the compression turbine associated. thereto that through the branching 17 sucks air under a rela tively moderated pressure from the manifold 10 and delivers high pressure air through the delivery tube 18 for any conceivable use.In another example the compressed air is sent from the manifold 10 through the branching 19 to the pneumatic motor 20 the output of which through a system comprising pulleys and transmission belts delivers power to a utilizing apparatus schematically shown and general ly shown in 21.In the third example, finally, the compressed air out coming from the manifold 10 through the injector 22 in the interior of the base of the injector pump or emulsion generating unit 23, where water exists at the same level of that in the well 24 in which it is par tially immersed forms a mixture of water and small air bubbles having a specific gravity lower than that of water, for which reason said mixture rises along the emulsion generating unit 23 up to an height such that the pressure at the base of this latter produced by the column of said mixture at the interior of it equates the pressure of the hydrostatic head in the well 24 above said base of the emulsion generating unit 23. At the outlet pert of the emulsion generating unit 23 said mixture separates itself again into water and air and while the first one overflows, the second one is dispersed in the atmosphere. The above described example is referred consequently to the use of the plant for the lifting of water.As it may be appreciated from figure 1, the rising co lupin of the emulsion generating unit 23 is of the kind flared upwards for the same reasons previously detail ed with reference to the tubular body 2 of the hydrostatic compressor 1 and it cgnstitutes the subject of another patent of the same applicant published italian application no. 86003 A 80 .An inconvenience common to the multi faceted use of the plant in question according to the prior art consists in that the air compressed by the hydrostatic compressor 1 after having delivered its own pneumatic energy to the utilizing machine, discharges to the exterior under a pressure substantially corresponding to the atmospheric pressure, for which reason the uti lizing machine is determined by the pressure differen ce between the one produced by the hydrostatic compre ssor and the atmospheric one.As it has been said previously the aim of the present invention is to increase the efficiency of the plant in question under the same operating conditions of a similar conventional apparatus and this aim is reached as it is shown in the two embodiment examples of figu res 2 and 3, wherein the components previously descri bed are shown with the same reference numerals given to them in figure 1 without any further detailed explanation.Considering now at first figure 2, it can be noted that the utilizing machine 14 fed, as described with reference to figure 1, by the compressed air taken from the bell 3 of the hydrostatic compressor by means of the manifold 10 and the branching 16, has the dischar ge or outlet connected to the diffuser 8 by means of the conduit 25, in order to create a substantially closed loop constituted of the hydrostatic compressor 1 manifold 10 branching 16 utilizing machine 14 connection conduit 25 diffuser 8 hydrostatic com pressor. Said loop allows to apply in register with the outlet of the utilizing machine 14 a pressure lo wer than the atmospheric pressure, thanks to the suct ion action of the hydrostatic compressor 1. It derives, from the above, that the utilizing machi ne 14 can exploit a greater pressure differential than the one that can be obtained with the conventional plants of the same kind with a consequent greater efficiency of the plant according to the invention.In figure 3, there is shown a plant realized according to the teaching of the present invention for the lifting Qf water.As it can be remarked from figure 3, the well 4 of the hydrostatic compressor 1 in the present example is clo sed at the top, with the exception of the mouth of the tubular body 2, and immersed upstream in the waterstream, indicated in 26, and forming a small head dif ference with respect to the downstream waterstream, indicated with 27. The upper volume of the well 4 is in communication with the atmosphere through the tube 28 for maintaining the head of water in it at the sa me level of the water stream downstream 27. The well 4 shows an opening 29 in its lateral wall for allowing the overflow of water that inflows the upstream water stream 26 through the tubular body 2 after the separa tion of the air entrained with it in the bell 3.The air collects in the pressurized state at a value depending upon the head of the water in the well 4 that resides above the bell 3.In the well 4, there extends in a position side to si de with the tubular body 2 of the hydrostatic compressor 1, the inlet part of a emulsion generating unit 23, of the air injection pump kind, that draws in the wa ter level at the interior of the bell 3 and is in com munication with the volume of compressed air collected in the bell 3 by means of an injector not shown . An emulsionated mixture of air and small air bubbles is formed, that having a specific gravity lower than that of water, rises in the rising column of the emulsion generating unit 23. The top end of said emulsion unit opens into a separation chamber 30, in which said mix ture separates again itself, in air and water. The air collects at the top of the separation chamber 30 for inflowing into a supply conduit 31 of a collection ba sin 32 located at a suitable piezometric height. Through the descending branching 33, the collected water may be fed to a utilizing machine, generally shown in 34, or it may be gravity distributed for other uses.According to the present invention the top air contain ing volume of the separation chamber 30 is connected with the diffuser 8 that ends at the interior of the inlet aperture of the tubular body 2 of the hydrostatic compressor 1 with the bulb part 9 provided with holes.As it has been described previously, the Venturi effect produced by water that laps the bulb part 9 of the dif fuser 8, induces a depression that sucks air from the diffuser 8 creating in it and the separation chamber 30 an environment of rarefied air. Naturally the head of water in the chamber 30 will be such as to balance the abovementioned depression in order to prevent a re flow of water from the conduit 31 into the chamber 30. The thus created depression in the chamber 30 allows therefore that the mixture of water and bubbles of air in the rising column of the emulsion generating unit 23 rises up to an height greater than that which could be reached if the environment in the chamber 30 where at the atmospheric pressure, as it happens in similar conventional plants, with an increase of efficiency for the plant according to the present invention.From the above disclosure, it results clear that a ve ry important component of the plant according to the present invention is the bulb 9 of the diffuser 8. According to the invention it has been found that a particularly convenient shape of said bulb 9 is the one shown in figure 4. In this figure there is shown into detail a section of the descent tube 2 wherein the diffuser 8 ending with a bulb 9 is immersed. The bulb 9 has the shape of a pair of cones being rather elongated, united at their base1 the upper cone 35 being connected to the tube of the diffuser 8 and the lower cone 36 being provided with a plurality of cali brated holes 37. This arrangement allows to obtain an effective mixing of the air outgoing from the holes 37 as a consequence of the suction action created by Ven turi effect in the throttling between the bulb 9 and the descending tube 2, as a consequence of the flow of water descending along the tube 2.
