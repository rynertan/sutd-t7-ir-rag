# Method and reagent for making a radiopharmaceutical composition based on technetium 99m.

## Abstract
A method of making a radiopharmaceutical composition by mixing an aqueous solution of pertechnetate with a reducing agent comprising tin metal or stannous ion to reduce the pertechnetate and a complexing agent to form a complex with the reduced technetium, is characterized by incorporating nitrate and or nitrite in an amount to diminish oxidation of Sn² to Sn⁴ , and hence to prevent re oxidation of technetium to pertechnetate, during preparation and storage of the complex. Nitrate and nitrite are superior to organic antioxidants previously proposed. A reagent for the purpose comprises the reducing agent, the complexing agent and the nitrate and or nitrite usually in a sterile freeze dried state.
