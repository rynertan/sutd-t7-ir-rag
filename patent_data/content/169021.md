# SOLID STATE SWITCH

## Abstract
A two pole solid state switch has a pair of series connected switching transistors 5 and 6 in each pole. Input lines 7 and 8 are isolated from output lines 9 and 10 by making the switching transistors 5 and 6 non conducting. Additional switches which are preferably additional switching transistors 12 and 13 are arranged between the interconnection points P of the switching transistors of each pair in the respective poles of the switch. The additional switching transistors 12 and 13 are put into a highly conducting state whenever the pairs of switching transistors 5 and 6 in the poles of the switch are in a non conducting state. As a result the effective isolation provided by the switch is greatly enhanced.
