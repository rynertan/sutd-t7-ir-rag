# A heat exchanger core construction utilizing a plate member adaptable for producing either a single or double pass flow arrangement.

## Abstract
A heat exchanger construction of the plate and fin type comprising a plurality of plate assemblies 43 joined together in a stackable arrangement, each plate assembly 43 being formed by a pair of similar plate members 10 placed in mating face to face relationship with each other to form a central flow region therebetween. Each plate member includes a header portion 12, 14 located respectively adjacent each opposite end thereof, each header portion having at least one pair of spaced openings 16, 18 or 20, 22 adaptable for receiving and discharging a fluid medium therethrough. A raised partitioning or pass rib 28 is positioned extending between the pair of spaced openings 16, 18 or 20,22 associated with one or header portions 12 or 14 and depending upon the positioning of the respective pass ribs 28 relative to one another when each respective pair of plate members 10 are joined together either a single pass or a double pass flow system is formed therebe tween. Each plate member 10 additionally includes spaced flange tabs 36, 38 arranged along the periphery 34 thereof, the flange tabs 36, 38 being positioned and arranged so as to register with and engage untabbed edge portions 39, 40 of a similar plate member 10 when placed in mating relationship therewith thereby forming a con tinuous sidewall 41 therearound between the mated plate members 10 regardless of whether the plate members 10 are joined together to produce a single pass or a double pass flow arrangement.
