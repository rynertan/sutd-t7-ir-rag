# Process for producing a non woven fabric of hot melt adhered composite fibers.

## Abstract
A process for producing a non woven fabric of hot melt adhered composite fibres having a high strength in a small weight thereof and sort feel includes forming a web of fibre aggregate consisting of sheath and core type composite fibres with the core component of the composite fibres being composed of a first component which is a fibre formable polymer and as the sheath component, a second component which is one or more polymers each having a melting point lower than that of the first component by 30 C or more and which has an average thickness of 1.0 to 4.0 microns, or mixed fibres of the composite fibres with other fibres containing the composite fibres in an amount of at least 20 by weight based on the total amount of the mixed fibres and subjecting the web of fibre aggregate to a heat treatment at a temperature which is lower than the melting point of the first component and equal to or higher than the melting point of the second component, and which affords to the second component an apparent viscosity of 1 10³ to 5 10⁴ poise as measured at a shear rate of 10 to 100 sec¹, thereby to stabilize the form of web of fibre aggregate by way of the hot melt adhesion of the second component.
