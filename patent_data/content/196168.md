# Fiber optic doppler anemometer.

## Abstract
A fiber optic doppler anemometer comprises a source 10 of coherent light, a directional coupler 14 formed by the com bination of a pair 12, 15 of single mode optical fibers, and a photoelectric transducer 17 . The first end 12A of the first fiber 12 receives an incident beam of light from the source 10 and guides it through the directional coupler 14 to the second end 12B of the first fiber 12 , which is located adja cent to a body 11 of moving particles to be measured, where both the second end 12B of the first fiber 12 and the moving particles reflect a portion of the incident light back into the first fiber 12 . The reflected light, which has a frequency different from that of the incident beam entering the first fiber 12 , is directed back through the directional coupler 14 which cou ples a portion of the reflected light toward the first end 15A of the second fiber 15 . The photoelectric transducer 17 receives the light emerging at the first end 15A of the second fiber 15 and converts it into analogous electrical signals. This system may be used as a velocimeter using the Dop pler effect to measure the velocity of moving particles and to measure the sizes of particles with Brownian motion.
