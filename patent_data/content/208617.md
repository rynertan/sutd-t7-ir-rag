# Controlled drug device and process for catalysing the erosion of an acid labile polymer.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the use of carboxylic, sulfonic, phosphatidic and or phosphate ester acids incorporated as a catalyst in poly ortho ester s and other acid labile polymers such that upon exposure to aqueous environments the acid catalyzes the erosion of the polymer matrix. The rate of release of a drug substance incorporated into or surrounded by the poly orthoester or other acid labile polymer can be controlled in that the drug is released as the polymer is eroded in response to the catalytic action of the acid incorporated therein.

## Description
There has been a long need in the field of drug delivery devices to have a drug released in the human body at the place where it is most therapeutically effective and to have said drug released in the body in a controlled manner over a long period of time. There is art showing that poly orthoester s can be used as a matrix for drug release however, there is no description in any of this art of the use of organic acids as catalysts to promote the polymer erosion in a controlled fashion. U.S. Patent 4,489,056 discloses the use of acid anhydrides as catalysts for the erosion of poly orthoester s. The patent discloses that the acid anhydride in an aqueous environment generates the corresponding acid. Acid anhydrides may in certain instances have the disadvantage, however, that they are reactive electrophiles that can acylate drugs containing a nucleophilic group, such as a hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl or sulfhydryl group. For example, when phthalic anhydride is used to catalyze the erosion of poly orthoester s, significant quantities of phthalic esters of hexane diol, one of the diols which are monomers of the poly orthoester , are observed. Similarly when timolol, a drug with a hydroxyl functionality, is incorporated into a poly orthoester with phthalic anhydride, a significant amount of timolol phthalate ester is observed. Similar reaction products are not observed when free acids, which are not acylating agents, are used as the acid catalysts. The release of norethindrone from poly orthoester s slabs has been described in the prior art. However, in this system a water soluble salt such as sodium chloride and the like was incorporated into the polymer and the proposed mechanism for drug release in this case was osmotic imbibing of water, causing the matrix to swell and burst. The drug release was not controlled by polymer erosion but by a swelling process. The present invention is directed to a controlled release device for the delivery of drugs or other biological beneficial substances which comprises The rate of release of therapeutically effective drug substance s or other beneficial substances hereafter collectively referred to as biologically active agents incorporated into or surrounded by such polymer acid catalyst mixtures is determined by the erosion pattern of the polymer resulting in controlled drug release. It has been noted that poly orthoester s polymer linkages herein described are unstable at acidic pH but relatively stable at neutral or basic pH. Thus, a carboxylic and or sulfonic acid which is incorporated into the polymer matrix would catalyze the matrix erosion. If, in addition, a pharmaceutical or therapeutic agent s or drug s or biologically active agent s is incorporated in the matrix of the polymer, it can be seen that the biologically active agent s can be released at a predictable rate from the polymer matrix as the polymer matrix is eroded by action of the acid. Also the polymer acid matrix could surround the drug or beneficial substance whereby the drug or substance will be released when the polymer acid matrix coating is eroded. The expected mechanism for breakdown and erosion of the polymer can be shown by the following equations where R is as defined further along. The rate of polymer matrix erosion and subsequently the rate of release of any drug s or biologically active agent s incorporated into or surrounded by the matrix can be controlled by choosing the proper acid or combination of acids. In selecting appropriate acids as catalysts the pKa, melting point, concentration, and hydrophobic character of the acids must be considered concomitantly for each poly orthoester system. For example, phthalic acid melting point 230 and the various phthalamic acid derivatives melting points 100 C discussed in the Examples section of the present invention have very similar first pKa s yet catalyze the erosion of the poly orthoester DETOSU 1,6 hexanediol When the drug or beneficial substance is surrounded or coated by the polymer acid matrix, the drug or beneficial substance can be discharged when the matrix erodes in a predictable time frame. In a more detailed description of the invention, the following types of polymers and acids are representative of those that can be used. Also there are described representative types of pharmaceuticals, therapeutic agents, biologically active agents or drugs or beneficial substances which can be incorporated into or surrounded by the matrix of said polymer to be released by reaction of the acid which catalyzes the matrix erosion.

The above list of drugs is not meant to be exhaustive. Many other drugs will certainly work in the instant invention. Examples of beneficial drugs are disclosed in The drug can be in various forms, such as uncharged molecules, molecular complexes, pharmaco logically acceptable salts such as hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfate, laurylate, palmitate, phosphate, nitrite, borate, acetate, maleate, tartrate, oleate, and salicylate. For acid drugs, salts of metals, amines or organic cations, for example quaternary ammonium can be used. Derivatives of drugs such as esters, ethers and amides can be used alone or mixed with other drugs. Also, a drug that is water insoluble can be used in a form that is a water soluble derivative thereof to effectively serve as a solute, and on its release from the device, is converted by enzymes, hydrolyzed by body pH or other metabolic processes to the original form, or to a biologically active form. The agent can be in the form of a solution, dispersion, paste, cream, particle, granule, emulsion, suspension or powder. Also, the agent can be mixed with a binder, dispersant, emulsifier or wetting agent and dyes. The amount of drug or beneficial substance incorporated into the polymer matrix will vary greatly depending on the particular drug, the desired therapeutic effect and the time span in which the polymer matrix is eroded to release the particular drug. Thus, there is no critical upper limit on the amount of drug incorporated in the polymer matrix and the lower limit will also depend on the activity of the drug and the time span for the erosion of the polymer and subsequently the drug release. Thus, it is not practical to define a range for the therapeutically effective amount of drug to be incorporated in the novel polymer matrices and acid combinations of the instant invention. However, in general the drug may be 0.001 up to 70 , by weight, of the polymer acid matrix by weight. When the erodible polymer acid matrix surrounds a drug formulation core as a coating or film to create a device the device can house from 0.05 ng to 5 grams or more of the drug formulation. The weight of the erodible polymer acid matrix serving as the coating will vary depending on the surface area to be covered and the thickness needed to achieve the desired drug release profile. Typically the coat will be 10 to 1,000 microns thick although thicker and thinner fall within the invention. The amount of acid incorporated into the polymer will be dependent upon the release duration of the drug or beneficial substance, and the particular acid used but would generally be in the range of slightly more than 0 , preferably 0.001 to a maximum of about 25 , by weight, of the polymer by weight. The drug or beneficial substance can be administered in various ways and shapes. For example, the polymer acid drug or beneficial substance can be incorporated into disc shaped devices, rods or sheets for under the skin implantation, spherical shapes and the like. Those skilled in the art would realize that the invention can be incorporated in any shaped device for the particular application it is being used for. The above described devices can be prepared by, for example 1. Methods of preparation include 1 Dissolution of components in solvent, evaporation of solvent, compression of matrix 2 Mechanical milling of polymer, acid and drug or beneficial substance followed by compression 3 Melt mixing of polymer, acid and drug or beneficial substance. In all cases, after mixing, standard pharmaceutical and plastics processing technology is used to make the dosage form. In order to control the rate of release of the drug or beneficial substance in a programmable manner, one can laminate layers wherein the polymer, acid and drug or beneficial substance in each laminate layer are varied in concentration or contain different species of each component. Multiple acids can be incorporated into the polymer to allow time variable or geometric considerations to be achieved. Additionally, the concentration of acid can be varied as a function of position in the matrix. At least enough water must contact the device to react with the acid and the polymer to cause erosion. Water in excess of this amount will not materially effect the performance of the invention.
