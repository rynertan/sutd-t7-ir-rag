For instance diamond back moth, army worms, common cabbage worm, aphids on brassicae leaf rollers, tea leaf roller,.white peach. scale on tea trees apple leaf miner, European red mite, on apple tees and the like can be controlled at one time. The compounds of the present invention exhibit especially superior effects against leaf miners such as diamond back moth, apple leaf miner, tea leaf miner and citrus leaf miner. In general, it is comparatively difficult to control those insect pests which have many number of generation or long breeding seasons and those insect pests which are parasitic to crops.. Generally, this means application of chemicals must be performed many times and in the case of crops this must be done without damaging the crop or making the crop unfit for consumption. The compounds of this invention have extremely long lasting effects against the above described noxious organisms, particularly against tea leaf roller,diamond back moth on vegetables, army worms, soy bean beetles, etc. and they are quite effective at controlling these insect pests with a minimum of applications.Furthermore, because the compounds of the present invention can safely be applied as an emulsifiable concentrate, a wettable powder or s dust directly or as a granule for treating the soil to agricultural crops such as rice, wheat vegetables, e.g., cabbage, raddish, Chinese cabbage, egg plant, green pepper, tomato, cucumber beans, e.g.., soybeans, kidney beans, adzuki beans, peas tea leaves cotton plant fruit trees, e.g., apple, citrus fruits, pears, kaki Japanese persimon , peach, grapes sugar beet potato, sweet potato, taro and the like.

A suitable amount of the compound to be applied varies depending upon various factors such as the climatic conditions, the soil conditions, the form of the chemical, the time of application, the method of application, or the types of cultivated crops to which it is applied and the diseases or the insects to be controlled. When the compounds of this invention are used as an insecticidal, miticidal or nematocidal composition, the compounds can be formulated into various forms such as an emulsifiable concentrate, a wettable powder, a dust, granules, fine granules and other generally employed agricultural preparations by optionally incorporating conventional agriculturally acceptable adjuvants, for example, a carrier such as clay, talc, bentonite, diatomaceous earth or white carbon, solvents such as xylene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, isopropanol or dimethyl naphthalene, or a surface active agent such as an allylbenzenesulònic acid metal salt, e.g., sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, a polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ether, e.g., a polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ether, a sodium alkylsulfate, a sodium alkylnaphthalenesuNfonate, or sodium lignin sulfonate. A suitablerati of the compounds of this invention to the adjuvant s ranges from 0.5 99.5 to 90 10, preferably 1 99 to 70 30 by weight. The insecticidal, miticidal or nematocidal composition of this invention can also be mixed with other insecticides, miticides and or nematocides to bring about improved effects. The above described preparations are applied to the soil or the stalks and leaves as they are or diluted at a rate of about 0.05 to about 20 kg ha, preferably 0.15 to 10 kglha, more preferably 0.5 to 5 kg ha, as active ingredient.In case where an emulsifiable concentrate or a wettable powder is used in foliar treatment, it is diluted to a concentration of about 50 to about 2,000 ppm, preferably 100 to 1,000 ppm, more preferably 250 to 500 ppm. In case of application from an airplane, further higher concentrations are employed.That is, a preparation such as an enulsifiable concentrate and the like is used as it is or diluted with a famll amount of water, e.g., 0,5 to 1.5 kg of an emulsifiable concentrate is diluted with 20 to 50 liters of water to obtain a concentration of 10,000 to 75,000 ppm. The present invention will further be explained more specifically by reference to the following formulation embodiments and examples but the invention is not to be construed as being limited thereto.
