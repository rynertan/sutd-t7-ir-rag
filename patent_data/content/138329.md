# System and method for operating a display panel having memory.

## Abstract
A display panel comprising a matrix of D.C. scan cells arrayed in rows and columns and a matrix of A.C. display cells arrayed in rows and columns, each scan cell being in operative relation with at least one display cell. The panel also includes a sustainer electrode associated with the dis play cells and operated by means of specially shaped sus taining signals to select and turn on desired display cells as the columns of scan cells are energized in turn. Disclosed are various routines for operating the sustainer electrode to achieve dimming in the panel and for maintaining proper display of a message in the panel.
