A coupling for connecting a distributor shaft 16 of an ignition distributor to a camshaft 40 of an internal combus tion engine comprises a plastics drive member 44 having a pair of drive lugs 44A that are engaged in a groove 40A formed in the end of the camshaft, the drive member also having another pair of lugs 44M that are engaged in a groove 46D formed in a metallic driven member 46 that is connected to the distributor shaft. Elastomeric sleeves 50 are disposed about these latter lugs, and torque is transmitted from the drive member to the driven member through the sleeves. The two members are secured together by arms 44K that extend from the drive member through recesses 46J formed in the driven member, the arms having tooth portions 44L engaging a wall surface 46K of the driven member.
