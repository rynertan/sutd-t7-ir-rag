# Lung surfactant compositions.

## Abstract
A synthetic protein free lung surfactant composition is utilized to temporarily substitute for natural lung surfactant in the mammalian lung where such natural lung surfactant is absent or in low concentration. The synthetic surfactant composition consists essentially of a major amount of 1,2 dipalmitoyl sn 3 glycerophosphoryl choline DPPC , and a minor amount of a fatty alcohol, preferably a fatty alcohol having from 14 to 18 carbon atoms, and especially n hexdecan 1 ol. The synthetic surfactant composition is admi nistered directly into the lungs of a distressed subject to create a film on the alveolar interfacial surfaces and reduce surface tension. Expansion of the alveolar spaces is thereby facilitated.
