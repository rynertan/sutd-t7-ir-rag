# Improvements in electroacoustic transducers.

## Abstract
An electroacoustic transducer is provided in the form of a flexible tape formed of an inner flat metal foil 10 surrounded by a metal foil 14 and separated from the latter by an electret 12. The outer metal foil 14 is in turn surrounded by a PVC outer lay er 20. This construction provides a flexible electret type of mi crophone with the additional advantage of immunity from am bient acoustic waves and electrical and magnetic fields.
