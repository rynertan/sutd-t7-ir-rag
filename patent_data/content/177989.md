# Polymer mixture.

## Abstract
The properties of polymer mixtures which comprise a polyphenylene ether and a polyvinyl aromatic compound can be improved by the simultaneous addition of an organic metal sulphonate compound and a block copolymer. In par ticular a combination of a good impact strength and a good resistance against agressive media under mechanical stresses environmental stress cracking resistance ESCR is obtained. This also applies to polymer mixtures having a high content of titanium dioxide.
