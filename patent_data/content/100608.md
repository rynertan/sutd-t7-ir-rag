# Time compression multiplex digital transmission system.

## Abstract
A digital transmission system in which bursts of digital signals B are transmitted in opposite directions over a two wire telephone loop 2 W at fixed frame intervals F . Each signal burst is bounded by initial and final synchronization bits 0, 81 and 82, 163 at its beginning and ending respectively. Synchronization is established by determining coincidence of the final bit of one burst, the initial bit of the following burst, and two gating signals 81, 0 having an equivalent time interval therebetween.
