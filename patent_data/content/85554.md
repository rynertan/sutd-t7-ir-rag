# Molecular analytical release tags and their use in chemical analysis.

## Abstract
A new class of chemical reagents called release tags which comprise signal, release and reactivity groups is disclosed and a release tag involving a pentafluorobenzoyl signal group, a methionylamide release group, and an active ester reactivity group is used to analyze the hormone, thyroxine, in serum, involving quantitation of the released signal group by gas chromatography with electron capture detection.
