# Hydrofining process for hydrocarbon containing feed streams.

## Abstract
At least one decomposable compound of a metal selected from the group consisting of copper, zinc and the metals of Group III B, Group IV B, Group VB, Group VIB, Group VIIB and Group VIII of the Periodic Table is mixed with a hydrocarbon containing feed stream. The hydrocarbon containing feed stream containing such decomposable com pound is then contacted with a suitable refractory inorganic material to reduce the concentration of metals, sulfur and Ramsbottom carbon residue contained in the hydrocarbon containing feed stream. The suitable refractory inorganic material may also be slurried with the hydrocarbon containing feed stream.
