# Light vehicle front suspensions.

## Abstract
A light three wheeled vehicle has a single front wheel 31 supported on one side thereof by a single support supporting member 32 . The single front wheel 31 is included in a front body structure 34 to which there is connected, by a swing joint 38 , a rear body structure 35 . The tendency of the vehicle to incline during running is reduced, and rectilinear running of the vehicle is achieved, notwithstanding the unbalanced weight of the steering structure resulting from supporting the front wheel 31 on one side only through a single support, by offsetting the front wheel 31 to one side of the centre line N₃ N₃ of the vehicle, being the same side as the supporting side of the supporting member 32 with respect to the centre line N₃ N₃ , on which centre line the centre of gravity G₈ of the rear body structure 35 lies. Also disclosed is supporting the front wheel 31 by the supporting member 32 on the side of its vehicle centre line N₃ N₃ opposite the rear wheel of greater driving force of two rear wheels 36 1, 36 2 having unequal driving forces.
