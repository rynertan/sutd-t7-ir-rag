# A METHOD OF MONITORING THE TEMPERATURE OF A STERILE DOCKING CUTTING MEANS

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of monitoring the tempera ture of a cutting means in a sterile docking apparatus for splicing two sterile thermoplastic tubes together by using a resistor heated cutting means, the method comprises 1 supplying a constant current to the resistor 2 measuring the initial voltage of the resistor 3 calculating, according to predetermined empirical relationship s , the voltage, time or both required to achieve a desired cutting means tempera ture if the initial voltage is within a suitable range, 4 measuring repeatedly the voltage of the resistor and the time to determine whether a the voltage reaches the calculated voltage within a specified time frame or b the calculated time has been reached within a specified voltage range and 5 splicing the tubes with the cutting means if the time frame or voltage range is met. The method is also applicable to other resistor heated elements in other devices having a constant head load environment.
