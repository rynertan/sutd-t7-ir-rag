## Abstract
The take out mechanism comprises gripper members 12 and driving means 26,28,32 operable to move an operating rod 20 vertically to move the gripper members between gripping and releasing conditions thereof. The driving means comprises a cam 26 which engages opposed surfaces 28 of the operating rod 20 , and motor means 32 to turn the cam through a preselected angle to move the operating rod vertically. The cam maintains contact with the opposed surfaces of the operating rod throughout move ment thereof so that the operating rod and, therefore, the gripping members are positively positioned.
