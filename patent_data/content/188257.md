# Linear motor and control method thereof.

## Abstract
A linear motor is disclosed, which comprises a first magnetic pole 2a, 2b, 2c having a plurality of alternatively protruded and recessed magnetic pole teeth of magnetic material arranged longitudinally at predetermined regular intervals of length, and a second magnetic pole 3a, 3b, 3c having a plurality of alternatively protruded and recessed magnetic pole teeth of magnetic material arranged in opposition to the first magnetic pole with a very small gap with the first magnetic pole. The ratio of the numbers of the magnetic pole teeth providing the protruded opposed parts of the first and second magnetic poles is 2 3 or a multiple thereof.
