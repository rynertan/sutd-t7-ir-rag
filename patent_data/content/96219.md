# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION METHOD BASED ON HISTOGRAM ANALYSIS

## Abstract
A method is described for classifying a document as bilevel or continuous gray scale for the purpose of selecting a compression algorithm for efficient transmission and or storage of the digitized image of that document. After the document has been at least partially scanned with a gray scale video camera and digitized pel values have been stored, a pel distribution table or histogram is formed. The histogram is analyzed to determine whether there is a peak region having at least 50 of the total number of pels. If there is not, the document is classified as continuous gray scale. If such a region is found, tail T and tail factor TF values are computed. The relative magnitudes of these values and the algebraic sign of the T value are used to classify the scanned document as continuous gray scale, white on black or black on white. Once the document is classified, an optimum data compression algorithm can be selected.
