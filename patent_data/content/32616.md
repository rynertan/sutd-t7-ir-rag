# Hand tool for terminating wires in an electrical connector.

## Abstract
The hand tool comprises a wire terminating ram 27 mounted for reciprocation relative to a frame block 23 which defines a guideway 32 for a connector 33 ex tending perpendicularly to the path of movement of the ram 27 . A connector indexing wheel 38 is rotated by a U shaped link 52 extending under the guideway 32 and having one arm 53 pivotally connected to the ram 27 and the other arm 60 carrying a spring mounted pawl 59 engageable with the teeth 45 of the indexing wheel 38 to rotate the indexing wheel 38 to index the connec tor 33 along the guideway 32 by movement of the ram 27 . A cam surface 57 on a lower edge of the link 52 permits the pawl 59 to fall out of engagement with a tooth 45 during a portion of the stroke of the ram 27 .
