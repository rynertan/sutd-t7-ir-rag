# MULTIPLE CONNECTOR ADHESIVE TAPE

## Abstract
Multiple connector tape has a flexible backing carrying a pattern of longitudinally electrically conductive stripes, each having an overlying adhesive band, each edge of which precisely follows an edge of the underlying conductive stripe. The adhesive bands may contain silver particles having thicknesses exceeding that of the adhesive between particles so that the terminals of an electrical device can be electrically connected through the particles to the longitudin ally conductive stripes when the tape is adhered by its adhesive to the device. Electrical connections can be made in the absence of such particles when the stripes are metal foil having embossings which protrude through the adhesive.
