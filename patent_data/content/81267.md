# APPARATUS FOR CONTACTING PARTICULATE SOLID MATERIAL WITH A FLUID

## Abstract
Apparatus for contacting particulate solid material with a fluid, comprising a column 1 having a normally vertically extending side wall 2 and provided with an inlet 5 for particulate solid material at its upper part, an outlet 6 for the particulate solid material at its lower part, an inlet 7 for fluid and an outlet 8 for the fluid, the interior of the column 1 being provided with a plurality of deflecting means 12 for deflecting a flow of the particulate solid material through the column, the deflecting means 12 being arranged one above the other and being inclined with respect to a vertical plane, and adjacent deflecting means 12 being staggered relative to one another. Passages are left free between the upper ends 13 of the deflecting means 12 and the column side wall 2 and between the lower ends 14 of the deflecting means 12 and said column side wall 2.
