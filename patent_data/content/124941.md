# Cathode ray tube.

## Abstract
A cathode ray tube comprising in an evacuated envelope an electron gun for generating at least one electron beam which is focused on a display screen to form a target and which is deflected into two mutually perpendicular directions so that a raster is written on the display screen, which electron gun comprises a cathode which is centred on an axis, a first grid at some distance therefrom along the axis and a second grid at some distance from the first grid, said first and second grids each having a part which is perpendicular to the axis and which comprises an aperture around the axis, the aperture in the first grid on the side of the second grid being elongate in a direction at right angles to the axis coinciding with a deflec tion direction and the aperture in the first grid on the side of the cathode being also elongate and the longitudinal axis of the aperture on the side of the cathode being perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aperture on the side of the second grid, the dimensions and the depth of the aperture on the side of the second grid and of the aperture on the side of the cathode being chosen to be so that in the beam current region which is of importance for the cathode ray tube substantially one cross over is formed in an astigmatic electron beam near the second grid, has a better spot quality than the tubes known so far.
