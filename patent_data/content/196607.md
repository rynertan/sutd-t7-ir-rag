# A satellite broadcasting receiving system.

## Abstract
In the storing mode, an operator section 136 is operated to direct a parabolic antenna toward a broadcasting satellite and to select a desired channel. After the desired channel is seized, a predetermined label is input from a label input part 166 . The satellite position and the selected channel are stored in a memory 160, 178 with the label attached thereto. When a search key is operated, the direction of the antenna is gradually adjusted. Whenever the direction of the antenna is adjusted, the receiving frequency is scanned to receive each channel. When a signal is received by the frequency scanning, the type of the satellite is recognized depending on the odd or even group of channels and on whether the antenna is set to horizontally or vertically polarized wave reception. The type of the satellite as recognized and the antenna direction at that time, the desired receiving channel transmitted from the satellite are stored into memory 160, 178 with a given label attached thereto. In the viewing mode, the stored label is designated and read out from the memory 160,178 through the label input part 166 . The antenna is directed toward a specific satellite, to receive a desired channel, and is also put into a receiving state to receive predetermined horizontally or vertically polarized wave.
