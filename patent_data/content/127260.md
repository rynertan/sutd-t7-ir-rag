# Opposed blastheads for the quench station of a glass sheet tempering system.

## Abstract
A composite blasthead 18, 20, 70, 72, 118, 120 for a quench station 16 of a glass sheet tempering system 10 is disclosed as including outer layers 28, 71, 73, 128, 128 and an inner layer comprising inserts 30, 32, 34, 74, 76, 130, 130 therebetween for defining passages 36, 80, 82, 136 through which cooling gas is supplied to a glass sheet in order to provide tempering. All of the inserts have inner end portions 38, 40, 42, 81, 138, 138 that cooperate to define inlets 44, 86, 144, 144 to the passages and also have outer end portions 46, 48, 50, 88, 146, 146 that cooperate to define passage outlets 52, 90, 152, 152 through which the quenching gas exits. All of the passages have a circular cross section along substantially the entire length of the passages. All of the inserts are of a configuration such that the passages of each blasthead are aligned with the passages of the other blast head so that the gas impinges on the glass surfaces in an opposed relationship with a uniform pattern over said sur faces thereby optimizing the degree of glass tempering.
