# Auxiliary channel for direct digital control system.

## Abstract
An auxiliary channel H coupled to a selected loop 10,11,13,14,100,21,22,10 in a plurality of process control loops included in a direct digital control system, the channel serving to expand the frequency response of the selected loop. The system is provided with a digital computer 100 acting as an electronic controller common to all loops, each loop including a transducer 11 sensing a particular process variable to produce a corresponding analog input signal i which is digitized and compared in the computer with a set point signal Sp to yield, after conversion, an analog output signal M
