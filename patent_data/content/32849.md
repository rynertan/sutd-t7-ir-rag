# Carburettor.

## Abstract
A carburettor 10 comprises an air passage 14 con taining a hollow toroid 40 having nozzles therein from which fuel water is injected into the air passage along the periphery thereof. Both the fuel and the water are fed from pumps and needle valves 50 and 52 on the one hand and 94 on the other hand and respectively control fuel and water flow to the toroid 40 . The position of one fuel control needle valve 50 is determined by the vacuum in the air passage and that of the other fuel control needle valve 52 by the setting of the butterfly valve 20 . An overflow line 42 leads away excess fuel that cannot pass the fuel needle valves 50 and 52 .
