# Helicopter rotor.

## Abstract
A helicopter rotor 10, 29 includes a rotor hub 11, 30 supporting a plurality of rotor blades, and a pitch control means comprising a universal joint 21, 45 adapted to permit both tilting and axial vertical movements of the control means to change the pitch of the rotor blades both cyclically and col lectively. The universal joint has three radially extending pins 22 each supporting a radially slidable and rotatable bearing 23 having a spherical external surface 25 , the bearings being located in generally axially extending tracks 26 having a circu lar cross sectional shape for rolling engagement by the bear ings. Axial movements are permitted by rolling of the bearings along the tracks and tilting movements by a combination of rolling and a sliding movement of the bearings along the pins. Several embodiments are described and illustrated.
