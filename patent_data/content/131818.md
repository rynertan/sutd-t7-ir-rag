# OPTICAL FDM SYSTEM

## Abstract
In an optical fibre FDM system, the carriers are derived from the output of a high quality Master Oscillator, which output at frequency f The oscillator output is also sent to the remote stations where it is frequency shifted by a Bragg modulator BM and the resultant similarly dealt with by a Raman Math device RNM2 to give five frequencies which are used to demodulate the channels. In an alternative the channel frequencies are switchable.
