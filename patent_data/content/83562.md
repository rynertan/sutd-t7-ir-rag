# Process for firing a furnace.

## Abstract
A method for minimizing the amount of nitrogen oxide pol lutants produced in a process for firing a furnace using oxygen or an oxygen enriched gas as the oxidant, in which furnace gases are aspirated into the oxidant jet prior to combustion and in which the furnace is operated using alternating low firing rate and high firing rate periods, by delaying the injection of oxidant at the high rate at the start of the high firing rate period.
