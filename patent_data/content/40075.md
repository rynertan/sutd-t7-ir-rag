# Hydraulic actuator.

## Abstract
An electro hydraulic proportional actuator includes a pis ton and cylinder 10 which is positioned hydraulically by fluid flow through two solenoid valves 15, 16 operable by an electronic control system. An operator control 34 provides an input voltage V‚ÇÅ representing a desired piston position and a transducer 35 generates a voltage V
