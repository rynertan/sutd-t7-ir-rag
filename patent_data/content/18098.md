## Description
Title Improvements in and relating to clamps and jigs DESCRIPTION This invention concerns clamps and jigs. Clamps and jigs are required for many purposes such as for holding workpieces so that drilling, milling and welding operations can be carried out on them and for jointing. Such clamps and jigs are often complicated and difficult to use. This invention seeks to provide a relatively simple but effective means of holding workpieces so that a desired operation can be carried out thereon. Accordingly this invention provides a device for holding one or more workpieces in which one or more cams are rotatable to urge the workpiece against an abutment means. Preferably the device has a base with a series of holes or openings for accommodating spigots or pegs of cams which are thus rotatable. The abutment means may be integral with the base or may be attachable to the base, say by pegs in the holes or openings. The shape of the cams is preferably generated from a Archimedean spiral and this ensures that the cam exerts a constant pressure across its entire working surface. A or each cam may be provided with an arm to facilitate rotation thereof. The holes or openings in which the cams are accommodated are preferably spaced apart slightly less than the working distance of the cam. The working distance is defined as the difference between the longest and shortest radii of the cam. The cams are usually made from plastics material, say by infection moulding although any other suitable material may be used, such as metal. However, the spigots or pegs and arms are preferably made of metal and fixed in the cams by any suitable method such as screwthreading or adhesive. A first preferred form of the invention is that of a mitre clamp, principally for use in forming right angle joints in wood say for picture frames. In this embodiment a base has a pair of clamping faces or walls forming a right angle and perpendicular to the base, and a series of holes, usually four spaced from each wall, successive holes of each series being further away from its wall. In use the two pieces of wood forming the joint are placed against the walls, adhesive or the like having been applied to mitred ends of the pieces and a cam placed in the appropriate hole of each series, depending on the width of the pieces, and rotated until the pieces are secured. The rotating of the cams has the advantage of urging the two pieces together thus ensuring the formation of a firm joint. A second preferred form of the invention is that of a universal jig. This embodiment is envisaged for securing workpieces of any shape and comprises a base which has a plurality of holes formed therein, usually at regular intervals over its surface. A plura lity of pegs, preferably shouldered pegs, and cams are provided, so that an appropriate number of pegs can be fitted into holes of the base, the workpiece placed against the pegs and cams placed in other appropriate holes and rotated until they urge and secure the workpiece against the pegs. The universal jig embodiment of this invention is to be used mainly as a drilling and milling jig, although it can be used as a means for clamping any workpiece or irregular profile whilst it is machined or worked on by hand. A guide plate for drilling operations may be used with the universal jig, and this can be achieved by providing pegs shouldered at both ends to fit holes in the jig base and holes in corner parts of the guide plate. Drill guide holes are provided in the guide plate and are usually formed by bushes made of hardened material. For a larger or cumbersome workpiece, it may be advantageous for a cam or cams to be positioned higher than base level, in which case a jacking block may be provided. Such a block will have means for securing it to the jig base, such as pegs to fit the base holes, and means for rotatably accommodating one or more cams. A third preferred embodiment of this invention is that of a welding jig, although it may be put to other uses. In this embodiment a base is provided with a pair of clamping faces or walls pivotable so as to form any desired angle adjacent ends thereof at which two workpieces are to be joined, and a series of holes for each wall, the holes being to accommodate cams rotatably. The walls are preferably each rotatable through 900 and means may be provided for fixing the walls in position once a desired angle is formed. For example, a screw threaded hole may be provided at the end of each of the walls remote from the pivot point and the base provided with slots following the arc of possible movement of the threaded holes so that a bolt may be inserted via the slots into the threaded hole to fix the walls in position. The welding jig i, particula r l.y useful in the manufacture of boxes and tanks as will be described later. The mitre clamp base is suitably made by die casting of an appropriate metal and drilling and reaming to form the required holes. Bases for the other embodiments may be made from steel plate drilled and reamed to form the required holes. The use of cams to secure workpieces has the advantage that it is extremely easy and quick to adjust and clamp securely workpieces compared with conventional methods. This invention will now be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a mitre clamp Figure 2 is a front elevation of the mitre clamp of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a partial view of the mitre clamp ofFigures 1 and 2 in the direction of the arrow X inFigure 1 Figures 4A and 4B show side and plan views respectively of one form of cam Figure 5 is a plan view of a universal jig Figure 6 is a section through the jig of Figure 5 Figure 7 shows a peg for use with the jig ofFigures 5 and 6 Figure 8 is a plan view of a guide plate for use with the jig of Figures 5 and 6 Figure 9 is a side elevation of the jig of Figures 5 and 6 fitted with the guide plate of Figure 8 Figure 10 shows a jacking block for use with the jig of Figures 5 and 6 Figure 11 is a plan view of a welding jig Figure 12 is a front elevation of the welding jig of Figure 11 and Figures 13A and 13B show plan and side respectively of another form of cam. Referring to Figures 1 to 4, a mitre clamp 10 comprises a base 11 having two series of holes 12 for accommodating cams 14 such as shown in Figures 4A and B and an upstanding part 15. This part 15 has two walls 17, 18 at right angles to each other and perpendicular to the base 10. The shape of the cam 14 is generated from anArchimedean spiral and is usually made by injection moulding of plastics material. To save material, the cam is recessed at 20, 21. The cam 14 has a peg 16 which fits the holes 12. The base 10 will usually be made as a die casting and the underside of the base may be recessed as shown to save materials. The mitre clamp is useful for constructing right angle joints in wood, the two pieces of wood being placed against the walls 17, 18 and being held in position by inserting a cam 14 in an appropriate hole 12 for each piece and rotating the cams until the pieces are secure. The cams have the advantage of forcing the pieces together to ensure a good strong joint. Turning to Figures 5 to 10, a universal jig 30 comprises a base 31 having a series of holes 32, usually formed by drilling and reaming for accommodating shouldered pegs 33 and cams 14 as shown in Figures 4A and 43 . In use, pegs 33 are inserted in appropriate holes 32, a workpiece placed against the pegs 33 and cams 14 placed in appropriate holes and rotated until the workpiece is secured. In addition a guide plate 35 can be fixed over the base 31 on pegs 36 shouldered at each end to fit holes 32 in the base and holes 37 in the guide plate 35. The guide plate 35 has a plurality of hardened guide bushes 38 inserted in holes therein to provide guide holes 39 for drill bits and the like. For larger or cumbersome workpieces, it may be advantageous for the cam to be positioned higher than the base level, in which case a jacking block 40 seeFigure 10 may be used. The jacking block 40 has a circular base 42 provided with a pair of diametrically opposed pegs 41 to fit holes 32 of the universal jig base 31 and a hole 43 to accommodate a cam 14. It will be appreciated that the jacking block base may be any desired shape and have any number of pegs 41 provided that they are sufficient to prevent the block moving when in use. Also, more than one hole may be provided to accommodate cams. The universal jig 30 can be used to secure any workpiece, no matter how irregular its shape is, for any purpose. Usually the universal jig will be used to secure a workpiece for drilling or milling by machine or by hand. Referring to Figures 11 to 13, a welding jig 50 comprises base 51 having two series 52, 53 of holes 54 and a pair of walls 55, 56 rotatable about posts 57, 58 respectively through an angle of 900.. The walls 55, 56 have at their ends remote from the posts 57, 58 screw threaded holes 59, 60 for receiving bolts or the like not shown via arcuate guide slots 60, 62 to secure the walls 55, 56 in desired positions. Cams 70 see Figures 13A and B are for use with the jig 50 and have a peg 72 which fits the holes 54 of the Jig. The cam itself is again generated from an Archimedean spiral and is provided with an arm 73 for use in rotating the cam when in a hole. In use, a workpiece or parts thereof are placed on the base 51, the walls rotated to suitable positions, cams are lifted in appropriate holes and rotated to secure the workpiece s for welding. The use of the jig 50 is, of course, not exclusively for welding workpieces but is particularly useful in welding sheet metal and fabrication shops or indeed, any workshop where two or more pieces of material are required to be welded together at any angle. The jig can be adjusted to take a wide range of materials and sections such as H rolled steel joists. Obviously the size of the jig used will be chosen depending on the size of the pieces to be welded. The welding jig is especially useful in the manufacture of boxes or tanks, where it is required to hold metal plates together during welding. This can be achieved by placing a jig at each end of a joint. In fact, the box or tank could be completely assembled using the appropriate numbered jigs prior to welding. It will be appreciated that other uses may be made of the specifically described embodiments other than those mentioned. However, it will be appreciated that the invention provides a simple but effective means for securing objects so that they can be worked on.
