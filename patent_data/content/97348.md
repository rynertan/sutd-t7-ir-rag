# Optical fiber drawing using plasma torch.

## Abstract
In order to provide a high power heat source having a very clean and invariable heat flux, a ring plasma 31 is induced in a heating zone of a plasma torch including a plurality of coaxial tubular elements 45, 46, 47, 54 and the optical fiber 22 is drawn through a channel 54 passing axially through the center of the plasma torch and of the ring shaped plasma 31 . In this manner the preform 21 from which the fiber 22 is drawn can be placed in close proximity to the induced plasma without exposure to non symmetrical temperature variations. Cooling gas passes through the heating zone either in an annular stream surrounding the plasma or in an annular stream passing through the center of the plasma around the preform and the fiber being drawn, or both. The heating zone is protected from environmental disturbances by an extension 52 of the outer tubular element 45 of the plasma torch which surrounds the heating zone. The plasma is induced by an RF source 33 in an undisturbed stream of a plasma forming gaseous medium, such as argon or a mixture of argon with oxygen, which flows through the heating zone.
