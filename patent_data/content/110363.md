# HEAT EXCHANGER STRUCTURE PARTICULARLY FOR NUCLEAR PLANTS

## Abstract
To reduce costs both through material and labour savings of a nuclear plantheat exchanger, the latter comprises two quadrangular cross section headers 1, 2 coupled by a yoke like tube nest 3 which is cold pre deformed in such a way as to minimize the primary stresses of thermal origin developed during the operation of the exchanger.
