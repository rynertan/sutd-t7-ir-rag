# Water soluble polysaccharides and diagnostic radio labelled derivates thereof.

## Abstract
A novel class of chelated radio labeled polysaccharide derivatives are useful for diagnosing formed, and forming, blood clots in a vascular system. Novel intermediate metal binding compounds comprise a water soluble polysac charide moiety having an average of at least 0.25 anionic groups per monosaccharide unit, and at least one chelating group derived from amino acids, substituted cyclic acid anhy drides, or carbon disulfide. The intermediate compound is then reacted with a radioactive tracer metal compound.
