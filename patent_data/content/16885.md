## Description
CLOTTING GEMSTONES This invention concerns gemstones, a method of cutting andyor polishing the same to improve their brilliance and a facet ing machine for enabling the method to be carried out. Gem cutters use standard cuts to achieve brilliance depending upon the shape of the uncut gemstone. Hitherto the facets of gemstones have been flat and the standard cuts cause incident light to be brought to a focus either within the stone or a short distance above the crown of the stone and consequently the full possibilities of brilliance are not realised. Terms used for parts of the gemstone are standard and are, the crown the portion of the stone above the girdle , the girdle the peripheral line of greatest dimension , the table the flat upper portion of the stone normally viewed through which light enters and leaves the stone , the pavillion the bulky portion of the stone below the girdle in which is liberally faceted to achieve light reflection , and the culet the lower most portion of the pavillion . This invention provides a gemstone having a crown portion which tapers from a girdle and pavillion portion tapering from the opposite direction to the crown and terminating in a culet and facets on the pavillion characterised in that each facet of the pavillion is a curved facet which term includes a single surface which is part of a cone or one c1. iS curved in a first direction and flat it the direction substantially at 90 to the first direction or is a series of smaller flat surfaces the lateral extremities of which die on the arc of a circle or the surface of the sphere or ellipsoid, and in that the curved facets are arranged in pairs and are so disposed relative to each other and the crown and table that light entering the stone through the crown and meeting the first curved facet of a pair is converged and reflected onto the second curved facet of that pair from which it is reflected to the crown of the gemstone. The pavillion may have ring of circumferential curved facets adjacent the table, a ring of circumferential curved facets at the culet and one or more further rings ol circumferential curved facets between the table ring and the culet ring, each ring defining a plane which is parallel to the table, all the facets of the same ring subtending the same angle with reference to the plane of the table and each successive ring the he direction from the table to the culet subtending a successively diminishing acute angle with the plane table whereby light which enters the crown, perpendicularly to the table undergoes a reflection at both curved facets of a pair and is reflected toward the eye of an observer in a direction at substantially perpendicular to the crown.Each curved facet of each pair of curved facets is arranged equally about an axis of symmetry of gemstone.Alternatively, the pairs of curved facets are disposed in common plane at an angle to one another, that is to say, the pairs need not be diametrically opposite one another in the gemstone and in an asymmetrically shaped stone one curved facet may direct light onto the next adjacent facet rather t han the facet which is directly opposite. The radius of the curved facets in the pavillion is greater than half the maximum distance across the girdle. Preferably the radius is of the order of the maximum distance across the girdle. The radius is preferably such as to cause light rays converged by ineide upon the first curved facet of the pair to converge but not to diverge within the stone before reaening the second curved facet of the air. The invention also provides a method of cutting eTstories as defined above by shaping a series of pairs of curved facets so that the light rays entering at or close to 900 to the table and falling on the first of the pair of faceted arcs are concentrated and reflected to the second of the pair of facets which in turn deflects the converged rays falling upon it from the first facet, into substantially parallel rays which are reflected back to the crown where allowing where applicable for refraction, much of the light emerges within the range of vision of an observer as a series qf bright light beams in which the rays are substantially parallel. The invention also provides a faceting machine for cutting gemstones comprising a movable lapping surface, a quill positioned close to the lapping surface, a holder projecting from said quill having means for supporting a radius arm at a plurality of preselected positions and a dopstick support pivotally connected at or near one end of said radius arm. The end of the radius arm nearest the pivotal connection carries a scale and the dopstick support has an indicator which moves over said scale thereby indicating the angular disposition of the gemstone axis to the radius arm.The radius arm may be cranked. Examples of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan of a symmetrical gemstone showing pairs of curved facets. Figure 2.is a plan of an asymmetric stone showing the arrangement of the pairs of curved facets. Figure 3 is a diagrammatic elevation of a stone showing the paths of various light rays through the gemstone. Figure 4 is a diagrammatic elevation of the same gemstone showing the path of an oblique ray through the gemstone. Figure 5 is a plan of the pair of facets shown inFigure 4 to demonstrate the path of the oblique ray shown inFigure 4. Figure 6 is a diagrammatic elevation of the sa gemstone showing the path of an oblique rag througb the gemstone Figure 7 is a plan of the pair of facets shown inFigure 6 to demonstrate the path of the oblique ray in Figure 6. Figure 8 is a diagrammatic side elevation of the faceting apparatus and Figure 9 is a diagrammatic side elevation of gemstone with various measurements marked thereon to show the way in which the curved facets are laid out and applied by the facetirlg machine. Ref erring firstly to Figures l and 3, the stone is symmetrical in layout, being substantially pyramidal having a pavillion 2 defined by four main faces 4. The crown 6 of the stone is flat and the culet 8 is centrally beneath the table 10. Each quandrant of the stone has a curved facet 12 adjacent the girdle, a curved facet 14 adJacent the culet 8 and an intermediate curved facet 16. As each quandrant is alike the curved facets are arranged in pairs and form rings as can be best seen in Figure 1. The curved facets 12, are of a radius about equal to the diagonal of the gemstone girdle.Each curved facet 12, 14, 16 is the product of several flat facets, one of which is indicated as 18. The curved facets 12. 14, 16 are each disposed at a slightly different acute angle with respect to the table being at say 420 a nd 440 and in consequence the light which enters the crown 6 in more or less perpendicular direction thereto is reflected parallel to the plane of the table from one curved facet 1 to the mutually opposite curved facet 122 which is the paired facet. Figure 2 shows an asymmetrical stone wherein the pairs of curved facets are not geometrically opposite each other. The light reflected from curved facet le will impinge on two curved facets 162 and 164, but 164 may alse be paired with 166 for some light rays. The curvature of the curved facets 12, 14, 16 ensures that the inteinal rei e of the light also produces a convergene and thereiore an inereast in light Intensity which emerges from the stone after a second reflection. Not all light rays are nearly perpendicular to the crown of the stone and when an oblique ray enters the crown as shown in Figure 4, the first incidence of the ray on facet 16 which is in effect the segment of a cone, directs the light downwardly into the stone and no longer is the ray a part of the plane of a circle. The angular dip causes the ray to travel from a curved surface as shown in Figure 5 with a radius of a circle to a smaller curved surface which defines the edge of an elliptical plane. Though the curved facet 14 is still a segment of a cone, the elliptical plane into which these rays are diverted after the first incidence is not efficient for reflection toward the crown of the stone.This is compensated to some extent by selecting a radius for the curved facets which will cause the rays to converge, but not to focus and then diverge within the stone between the pair of curved facets. The reverse situation is shown in Figure 6 and 7.Here a perpendicular central ray undergoes its first reflection at a curved facet 14 of the culet 8 and a second reflection at the curved, paired facet 12. Convergence results but not an increase in intensity of light as once again the rays are confined within an elliptical plane. Thus it will be seen that the length of the radius is critical and for a correct understanding, reference is made both to Figure 9 and to the parts of the faceting machine shown in Figure 8. Referring to the latter, the quill 18 which has a protractor not shown supports a cranked holder 20. A radius arm 22 graduated in hundredths of an inch is held in the bore of the holder by a finger screw 24. A protractor scale 26 is fixed to the radius arm and the arm also supports a dopstick holder 28 for a gemstone 30 to which holder is attached a pointer 32. A clamping screw 34 secures the holder 28 and pointer in any one of a number of selected positions in relation to the lapping surface 36 two positions of which are shown . Referring now to Figure 9 the radius may be calculated from a plan of the stone or the stone may be preformed and the length of travel of the light ray which each curved facet is to concentrate, may be accurately measured. This length bears no relation to the diameter or thickness of the gemstone at the point of the centre of the facet. In Figure 9 there is shown an arc of facets to be cut at B, of which each facet is at angle F to the table 10. The radius is calculated from the length BC. This length is reduced or increased usually by 10 to 20 depending on the curvature of the arc at point C, so as to turn the rays parallel to each other. The angle Q which the ray makes with the facet to be cut at B is set on the main quill protractor. The angle F is the facet angle.The angle I is the difference between angle F and angle Q. Angle I is set on the protractor 26 which ensures that the stone is turned in such a direction in relation to the lapping surface that the arc is cut so that it is circular in the planar reflection BC but is elliptical In the plane of the table FE. From the corrected length BC the dimension to be set on the radius arm is calculated by the equation If F Q, C R L Cos 90 Angle I A Sin If F Q, C R L Cos 90 Angle I A sin Where C equals dimension required, R s corrected length BC, L is the distance from the fulcrum made by tbe claniping screw 24 to the centre of the arc ci facets to be cut, and T is the distance between the centre of the arc and the vertical line through the centre of the stone usually half the diameter of the stone at the arc to be cut I have found the advantages of the above cuts to be as follows. The waste of gemstone mater is reduced. Stones of irregular shape may be cut to show the same de ee ef brilliance as a stone of regular shape. .4 reate ety of shapes is possible that is the stone need not be r to conform with the step , trap or emerald ut My , f t achleves the same degree of brilliance in any s ape of stone except a long thin stone. Darker stones which were formerly too dark or too milky to provide any brilliance are now commercial possibilities. The concentration of brilliance hides the pavillion facets and gives the impression that there is a light source within the stone. The shape of the brilliance as distinct from the shape of the stone may be controlled. The brilliance may be made to appear as a bar, a cross, a flower or a cluster of stars.
