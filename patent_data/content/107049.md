# Method of reducing the rumen digestibility of protein.

## Abstract
This invention is concerned with improvement in the nutritive value of soybean meal, and other vegetable seed proteinaceous meals, for ruminant animals. This is accom plished by treating the meals with water soluble zinc salts to provide zinc ions for reaction with the protein. The zinc ion containing meal is preferably subjected to heating at an elevated temperature. The treatment reduces the rumen digestibility of the protein of the meal.
