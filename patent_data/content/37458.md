# Time division multiple access satellite communications controller.

## Abstract
A control architecture is disclosed for a communications controller, for connecting a control processor 32 in the communications controller to a plurality of internal proces sing subunits 50 300 which operate asynchronously at different data rates. The architecture includes a control adap ter 500 which is connected between the control processor and a common subunit bus 604 , for receiving from the con trol processor, a control command, a plurality of data words, and an associated address for a respective one of the proces sing subunits. The control adapter outputs an operating code and the plurality of data words on the common subunit bus and further outputs a subunit select signal on a respective subunit select line to the subunit designated in the address. The adapter further includes a memory for storing the number of shift intervals to be applied to a stack shift signal which is output on a stack shift bus which is common to all of the subunits. The architecture further includes a register stack in each of the processing subunits. having a data input con nected to the common subunit bus and a select input con nected to the respective subunit select lines from the adapter. Each selected register stack will serially shift and store the operating code and each of the plurality of data words from the common bus, into respective stages of the register stack. The control architecture further includes a timer and a response time storage in the control adapter, having a stored, predetermined execution period associated with each of the processing subunits so that data can be selectively read from each of the subunits without regard for its asynchronous operation.
