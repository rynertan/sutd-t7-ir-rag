# TILTABLE SUPPORT STAND FOR VEHICLES

## Abstract
A low cost, tiltable vehicle support stand 20 is provided which is inherently stable in use and is designed to develop a righting moment during vehicle setup operations so that a vehicle can be quickly and easily elevated to facilitate work thereon. The preferred support stand 20 includes a relative ly wide base 22 having an elongate, transversely extending beam 38 secured thereto a pair of padded vehicle engaging members 48 are shiftably mounted on the beam 38 and are spaced apart a distance greater than the effective width of the base 22 . In this manner the center of gravity of a supported vehicle lies in a plane which passes between the lateral side margins 34, 36 of the base 22 , even in the event that the stand 20 or vehicle engaging members 48 are located asymmetrically relative to the underside of the vehicle. This stand configuration also ensures that the vehicle and stand 20 will right themselves during initial setup, which generally involves sideways elevation and tilting of the vehicle, placing a pair of the support stands beneath the vehicle in a similarly tilted orientation, and lowering the vehicle to effect reverse tilting of the vehicle and stands 20 until the same are righted and the vehicle is elevated.
