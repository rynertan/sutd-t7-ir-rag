# Weight lifter s belt.

## Abstract
A longitudinally extending section of elastic material 12 of predetermined width is secured at one end to an end of a longitudinally extending section of relatively non elastic material 14 to form therewith a body encircling lifting belt 10 . A plurality of bendable stays 50 64 are secured in pockets 70 84 formed along one surface of said belt and so as to extend across the width thereof a pair 50, 52 of said stays being carried by said elastic section, one 54 of said stays being disposed at the place where said elastic section is secured to said non elastic section, and five 56 64 such stays being carried by said non elastic section. Two additional torsion support stays 90, 92 are disposed in longitudinally extending pockets 86, 88 each positioned between a pair of said other stays to form therewith a pair of spaced H shaped torsion supports. The torsion sup ports being carried by said belt for disposition one to each side of the spine of the person wearing the belt, and in proximity to their lumbar and pelvic body areas. As such, the belt when worn will reduce spinal stress, transmit stress from the lumbar area to the pelvic, reduce the speed at which the wearer can bend, and prevent excessive twisting of the wearer s torso, when lifting and performing other materials handling tasks.
