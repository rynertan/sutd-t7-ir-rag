# Earth boring machine cutterhead and frame.

## Abstract
A main frame for a rotary cutterhead of an earth boring machine, has an annular beam 30 by which the cutterhead 20 is mounted onto the earth boring machine for rotation. The frame has a central hub structure 26 disposed for wardly of the annular beam 30 and connected thereto by a plurality of radial spoke beams 28 . The spoke beams 28 extend rearwardly and radially outwardly form the hub structure 26 to the annular beam 30 thus making the main frame generally dome shaped. Cutters supported on the spoke beams 28 can be serviced manually from within dome shaped frame.
