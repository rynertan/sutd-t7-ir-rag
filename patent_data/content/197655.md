# APPARATUS FOR RECONSTITUTING A CONCENTRATE

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 for mixing two liquids in desired propor tion to provide and dispense a homogeneous beverage on demand in an individual portion, the apparatus including first 18 and second 42 cylinders with reciprocating pistons 24, 46 operable to respectively pump proportionate amounts of the first and second liquids during forward and backward strokes of the pistons, mixing means 32 for mixing the first and second liquids provided from the first and second cylinders, dispensing means 32 for receiving the liquids from the mixing means and discharging them through an outlet to an individual portion sized container, control means 68, 70 for initiating pumping by the first and second cylinders and pistons, and means for automatically terminating the pumping after the pistons have traveled predetermined distances corresponding to a volume of beverage equal to the individual portion. Also disclosed is using a piston sensing means to sense the position of the pistons and provide a control signal when the pistons have reached predetermined positions to cause the pistons to reverse direction.
