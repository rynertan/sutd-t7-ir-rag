# Fire resistant connections and U like sealing means therefor.

## Abstract
A fire resistant connection 16 that embodies a U like sealing means 44 and that is operable for purposes of effec tuating the establishment of a fire resistant seal between mat ing surfaces 56, 58 , and in particular mating surfaces 56, 58 of the type that commonly are found to be present in wellhead and valve equipment 10 . The subject fire resistant connection 16 includes mating seal surfaces 56, 58 and the aforemen tioned U like sealing means 44 . The U like sealing means 44 comprises a U like seal ring 44 , which includes a rib 46 from which a pair of legs 48, 56 depend. Each of the pair of legs 48, 50 terminates in a planar seal lip 52, 54 . Each of the seal lips 52, 54 is suitably configured so as to be positionable in sealing engagement with a corresponding one of the mating seal surfaces 56, 58 , the latter 56, 58 embodying a configu ration that is complementary in nature to that of the seal lips 52, 54 engaged thereby. Likewise, the rib 46 is suitably con figured so that it forms an interference fit with the mating seal surfaces 56, 58 .
