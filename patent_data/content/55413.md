# Orificing of steam separators for uniform flow distribution in riser area of steam generators.

## Abstract
A vertical shell and tube steam generator 10 which has a plurality of U shaped tubes 60,62 through which the heating fluid flows, vaporizing fluid flowing on the outside of the tubes. A plurality of separators 26 are located above the tubes to remove liquid from the generated vapor. Orifices are located in some of the separator inlets 22 located above the hot leg region 60 of the U tubes reducing the problem of overloading of these separators 26 by accomplishing a more uniform flow distribution of vapor from the areas above both the hot 60 and cold 62 legs of the U tubes.
