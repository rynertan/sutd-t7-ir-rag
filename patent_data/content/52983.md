# Wire transfer mechanism.

## Abstract
A wire transfer mechanism for transporting a length of wire conductor from a feed location to a terminating location and then depositing the length of wire at a collection location includes at least one transfer arm 12 mounted for pivotable motion back and forth a releasable gripper mechanism 13 positioned at the end of each transfer arm for gripping a length of wire to inhibit relative motion in a direction normal to the axis of the wire. An actuator mechanism 24 serves to release the gripper mechanism 13 while the transfer arms 12 move from a wire terminating position to a wire pick up position at a finite velocity and for decelerating the transfer arms, so that the momentum of a wire gripped in the gripper mechanism will carry it away from the transfer arms in a direction normal to the axis of the wire.
