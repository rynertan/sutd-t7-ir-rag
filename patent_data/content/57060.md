# Apparatus for terminating ribbon cable.

## Abstract
Apparatus 5 for terminating ribbon cable 6 to a two row connector 7 having insulation displacing terminals facing opposite sides comprises a cable programming station 10 on a carriage 11, a connector positioning carriage 70, and a terminating station 50. The cable programming station 10 has combs 30, 30 which deflect individual conductors 8 from the plane of the cable 6 into channels 35, 35 in a pair of spaced apart templates 34, 34 which realign the conductors 8. The connector positioning carriage 70 is slidable on a pair of rails 71, 72 to position a connector 7 between the templates 34, 34 , and the two carriages 10, 70 are moved as a unit to the terminating station 50 where the connector 7 is positioned between a pair of insertion rams 52, 52 , which have tooling 55, 55 which passes through slots 36, 36 in the templates 34, 34 to terminate the conductors 8.
