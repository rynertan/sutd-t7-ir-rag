# FUEL CELL BATTERY HYBRID SYSTEM HAVING BATTERY CHARGE LEVEL CONTROL

## Abstract
A fuel cell battery hybrid power system is disclosed which has a microprocessor based control system. The control sys tem enables the fuel cell to be taken out of the system by a switch when its predetermined maximum desired energy out put is about to be exceeded by load requirements. The battery is protected from overdischarge through a switch. The switch can be activated in response to the sensing of state of charge, load current and fuel cell current. The surge battery is selected as the battery having the highest level of charge at any given time.
