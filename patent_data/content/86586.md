# Radio frequency alternate path phase switch.

## Abstract
An alternate path phase switch has a primary conduc tive region 10 and control regions 13, 14 which provide alternate paths in gaps formed with the primary region. Switching means 18, 20, e.g. PIN diodes, control the poten tials on the control regions 13, 14 and select the path followed by microwave radiation. Each path results in a different phase in the output so the device acts as a phase modulator.
