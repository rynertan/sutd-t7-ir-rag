# Amorphous alloy for magnetic core material.

## Abstract
There is disclosed an amorphous alloy for a magnetic core material represented by the formula Co According to the present invention, it could be provided an amorphous alloy suitable for a magnetic core material of a magnetic amplifier in which its coercive force is as low as 0.4 oersted or less at a high frequency of 20 KHz or more, particularly even at 50 KHz, and its rectangular ratio is as much as 85 or more.
