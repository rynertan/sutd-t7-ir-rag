# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE MANUFACTURE USING AN IMPLANTATION STEP

## Abstract
In the manufacture of a semiconductor device, e.g. a bi polar or MOS transistor, a narrow beam 4 of ions is de flected across a major surface of a semiconductor device body 1, 2 to implant ions, e.g. of boron, into a region 3 of the body. In accordance with the invention a resist mask 5a is obtained autoregistered with the implanted region 3 by effecting the implantation through a layer 5 of ion sen sitive resist thus exposed by the ion beam 4 in the area 5a overlying the implanted region 3 at the same time as the implantation occurs into the body region 3 . The non exposed area of the layer 5 is afterwards removed by de veloping the resist, and the ion exposed area 5a is then used as a mask during a subsequent processing step, e.g. an etching or doping step, in the device manufacture. The implanted region 3 may be, e.g., a peripheral base region portion of a bipolar transistor or a parasitic channel stopper below a field insulating layer 2 of an MOS integrated circuit.
