Port P2 is closed and ports P1 and P3 communicate when solenoid S is de energized to allow plunger Q to move downwards by the force of spring F, thus allowing atmosphere to be admitted into the acting chamber through ports P3 and P1 to break the vacuum. The device of this invention is further provided with control unit U to which first through tenth detectors and the trigger switch are electrically connected for delivering relevant control signals to the control unit when respective members move, while the solenoid valves are also electrically connected to the control unit so as to receive relevant operation signals from the control unit for operating respective solenoid valves to allow the vacuum to act on respective actuators to perform the designated operations. The operational principle and the general arrangement of the device of this invention has been outlined above. The details of each component will now be described as follows. Fig. 3 shows the general arrangement and construction of the first actuator Al in connection with disc clutch assembly C.In the drawing,W is a flywheel transmitting the output of the engine C1 is a clutch housing mounted on flywheel W 20 is a drive shaft having one end rotatably supported by flywheel W, and the other end operatively connected to an input shaft, not shown, of transmission T, not shown is a clutch plate or driven plate splined onto drive shaft 20 20C is a pressure plate 20a is a release bearing rotatably and slidably mounted on drive shaft 20 20b are release levers pivotally supported by clutch housing Cl each having one end pivotally connected to pressure plate 20C and the other end disposed in abutment with an inner surface of release bearing 20a 20f are clutch springs for urging pressure plate 20C and clutch plate 20e against flywheel W.Release bearing 20a is provided with a release collar 20g operatively connected to first actuator Al, 20d is a lining. First actuator Al comprises first half casing 21 joined with second half casing 22, diaphragm 23 fixedly disposed between first and second half casings 21 and 22 to form acting chamber 25 and free chamber 24, acting chamber 25 being sealed airtight and communicating with vacuum reservoir 10, not shown, with vacuum tube 38 provided with first solenoid valve V1 and free chamber 24 communicating with atmosphere through central opening 22A.Diaphragm 23 is provided with a push rod 27 having an inner end fixedly mounted on the free chamber side thereof and an outer end extending outwardly through central opening 22A, the outer end being operatively connected to release collar 20g with a clutch lever 28 which is pivotally supported by a frame structure 29.On the acting chamber side of diaphragm 23 there is provided a hollow rod 30 having an inner end fixedly connectet to diaphragm 23 and an outer end extending through first half casing 21 into a restricting device 34 having an inner end fixed to first half casing 21 and an outer end provided with a vent tube 35 having first auxiliary solenoid valve V1A, The outer end of hollow rod 30 is provided with an orifice 303 as shown in the inset of the drawing and extending into interior chamber 341 of restricting device 34.

As soon as first solenoid valve V1 is de energized, acting chamber 25 is isolated from the vacuum source as first solenoid valve V1 is of the two way type which only performs opening and closing of the passage of vacuum tube 38 and no atmosphere will be introduced into acting chamber 25 when the passage is closed. At this moment, first auxiliary valve V1A is energized to admit air into its interior 341, thus allowing air to be drawn into acting chamber 25 through orifice 303, second opening 302, hollow interior 30a and first opening 301 and allowing clutch plate 20e to be engaged with flywheel W by the force of clutch spring 20f. Second opening 302 is so disposed to be closed by the inner end portion of throttle device 34 as soon as hollow rod 30 moves inwards, thus causing the admitted air to flow through orifice 303 only, which restricts the flow of air and slows down the engagement process of the clutch, so that an abrupt engagement of the clutch may be avoided.

Solenoid valves V1, V2A, V2B, V1A, B, V4 and V5 are electrically connected to periphery input input U3 so that relevant operation signals to these solenoid elves are delivered from periphery input output.Periphery inputItput U4 is electrically connected to a digital display Y so as to ldicate numerically the automobile road speed. Control processing nit U1 is adapted to deliver execution orders according to the nstructions delivered by ROM U6 or RAINS U7 and U8. ROM is provided ith a program as outlined above, which will be described later. ower supply U9 is adapted to supply power to each component member f control unit U, the power being supplied by battery E on the automobile with power lines B1, B2, wherein power line B1 is provided with a relay switch SW electrically connected to the gnition switch, not shown, of the automobile so that control init U is energized when the ignition switch is turned on, and ze energized when the ignition switch is turned off. The program as outlined above is stored in ROM U6 to operat the device of this invention to perform the following functions when the ignition switch of the automobile is turned on and the control unit energized accordingly. It is to be understood that during the operation process the engine is running and the ccct is maintained in vacuum reservoir 10 Fig. 1 , and mode selects switch M A is in the automatic position.1. while the engine is running at idling speed , and when accelerator pedal 90 is released and thus trigger switch D is not activated i.e., the trigger is open , control unit delivers operation signals to disengage clutch C and to maintin clutch C disengaged. 2. As soon as accelerator pedal 90 is depressed or touched by the foot, trigger switch Dll is activated closed and control signal is delivered to control unit U, which then 1 delivers an operation signal to and activates the sixth solenoid valve V6, so as to allow vacuum to be applied sixth actuator A6 to pull bell crank 93 and prevent bt crank 93 from being moved by accelerator pedal 90.In process, spring 91 stretches to offset the movement of accelerator pedal 90 so that throttle valve 92A will nz move even though accelerator pedal 90 is depressed 2 checks transmission gear position, automobile road spe selector switch position H, L1, or L2 , and delivers relevant operation signals to solenoid valves V2A, V2B V3A, V3B, V5 respectively to perform shifting of the transmission into an appropriate transmission gear pos within the following prescribed speed range A if selector switch position H is selected transmission sear position driving speed range Km hr 1st gear 0 10 2nd gear 10 20 3rd gear 20 40 4th gear over 40 B if selector switch position L1 is selected transmission aear position driving speed range 1st gear 0 15 2nd gear 15 30 3rd gear 30 45 4th gear over 45 C if selector switch position L2 is selected transmission aear position driving speed range 1st gear 0 20 2nd gear 20 35 3rd gear 35 50 4th gear over 50 D if selector switch R is selected transmission is shifted to R . E if selector switch N is selected transmission is shifted to neutral position. 3 if the transmission gear position is not in the appropria position with respect to the prescribed road speed range, or direction, control unit U acts to deliver a series of operation signals to shift the transmission accordingly, the shifting operation being preceded by disengaging clutch C and followed by the engaging clutch C both by first actuator Al. 4 As soon as the transmission is shifted to an appropriate gear position with respect to the automobile road speed, control unit U acts to de energize solenoid valve V1 and in the meantime an operation signal is delivered to solenoid valve V1A so as slowly to break the vacuum in the first actuator Al to allow clutch C to be engaged gently. In this process the automobile driving speed is checked and if the driving speed is above a certain level, say over SO Km hr, another operation signal is delivered to solenoid valve V1B so as to break quickly the vacuum and quickly engage the clutch. 5 As soon as the shifting of the transmission is completed and first solenoid valve V1 is de energized to allow clutch C to be engaged, sixth solenoid valve V6 is de energized to release sixth actuator A6 so that bell crank 93 may be operated by the accelerator pedal and thus the throttle valve of the carburator may be opened to accelerate the engine. The driving speed ranges prescribed in the above operation A , B and C can be conveniently changed dependingon the horsepower capacity of the engine with respect to the pay load capacity of the automobile, as well as at the preference of the driver. The change of the aforesaid driving speed ranges can be done by replacing the program stored in ROM U6, which is an erasable programmable read only memory and is of great advantage for this purpose.3. The above operation A , B and C are performed while the automobile is moving forwards or at a stop and operation D is performed only while the automobile is at a stop or moving backwards.4. The clutch is disengaged when accelerator pedal 90 is released trigger switch D11 is opened and the automobile road speed falls down to the lower limit of the speed range of the transmission gear position at which the automobile is being driven. The actual use and operation of the device of this invention will be described as follows, with reference to Fig. 1. Firstly, the engine is started and the automatic position of mode selection switch M A is selected and selector switch H is pushed. Secondly, the accelerator pedal 90 is depressed by the foot, thus causing trigger switch D11 to close control unit U then acts to activate sixth actuator A6 so that throttle valve 92A of carburator 92 will not move until the gear shifting is completed and the engine will not accelerate immediately in the meantime clutch C is disengaged, transmission T is shifted to first gear and then the clutch is gently engaged. In this process the second, third, fourth and fifth solenoid valves and the second, third, fourth and fifth actuators operate in the following order Assuming the transmission is initially in the neutral position 1. fifth solenoid valve V5 is energized to actuate fifth actuator AS, allowing push rod 51 to move 2. third A solenoid valve V3A is energized to actuate third actuator A3, causing shift arm 63 to move upwards thus causing shift rod 61 to rotate and shift finger to engage with first shaft bar B31 3. fourth solenoid valve V4 is energized to actuate fourth actuator, allowing push rod 41 to move 4. second B solenoid valve V2B is energized to actuate second actuator A2, causing shift rod 61 to move toward the from end to shift the transmission into the first gear 5. fourth and fifth solenoid valves V4, V5 are de energized so as to cause push rods 71 and 68 to resiliently abut on push rods al and 51 respectively. During the process of engaging clutch C, actuator A6 is released and throttle valve 92A of carburator 92 is allowed move and thus the engine is accelerated. As soon as the automobile road speed increases to over 10 Km hr, control unit U acts to cause transmission T to shift from the first gear to the second gear. In this process 1. fourth solenoid valve V4 is energized 2. second B solenoid valve V2B is de energized and second A solenoid valve V2A is energized simulteneously, so that shift rod 61, and first shift bar B31, are moved from the first gaer to the second gear position without stopping at the neutral position and then 3. fourth solenoid valve V4 is de energized. The shifting operation is preceded by a disengagement operation of clutch C and followed by an engagement operation of clutch C.As soon as clutch C is disengaged, sixth actuator A6 is activated to close the throttle valve so as to slow down the engine speed until clutch C is re engaged. Sixth actuator A6 is then released to allow the throttle valve to be opened by depressed accelerator pedal 90. As soon as the driving speed increase to over 20 Km hr, transmission is shifted to the third gear in the similar manner as described above. In this process 1. second A solenoid valve V2A is de energized and second B solenoid valve V2B is energized simultaneously so that shift rod 61 and first shift bar L1 are moved back from the second gear but are stopped at the neutral position as push rod 71, being urged by the spring in fourth actuator A4, engages with slot all to stop the movement of push rod 41 2. third B solenoid valve V3B is energized and third A solenoid is de energized simultaneously, so as to move shift arm 63 downwards, and shift finger 610 from shift barB31 but to be stopped at second shift barB32 as push rod 68, being urged by the spring in fifth actuator AS, engages with slot 511 to stop further movement of push rod 51 then 3. fourth solenoid valve V4 is energized to allow push rod 41 to move further, thus allowing shift rod 61, and second shift bar B32, to move to the third gear position. The similar process is repeated as the automobile road spe ed continues to increase, until it reaches over 40 Km hr, and transmission T is shifted to the fourth gear, accordingly. When accelerator pedal 90 is released from being depressed, while at the fourth gear, for example, when one wants to slow the road speed, trigger switch Dii is caused to open, thus causing transmission T to remain at the fourth gear. When the driving speed slows to 40 Km hr, which is the lower speed limit of the fourth speed, control unit U acts to cause clutch C to disengage and remain disengaged. This enables the automobile to further slow down as one applys the brake to the moving automobile. When the driver wants to speed up the automobile after the automobile has slowed down to a certain speed, say 15 Km hr, he can simple depress or touch accelerator pedal 90. Then trigger switch Dll is closed and control unit U acts to check the transmission gear position which is to fourth gear, with respect to the road speed which is 15 Km hr, and thereby t shifting of transmIssion T acccr. d with the acceleration of engine speed takes place, until transmission T is shifted to the second gear to which the road speed of 15 Km hr belongs, and then clutch C is engaged and the throttle valve is moved to speed up the engine.A similar process is performed when the automobile is brought to a stop and is then moved again When the driver wants to back up the automobile from moving forwards, firstly, accelerator pedal 90 is released and the brake is applied Second, selector switch R is pushed by hand and accelerator pedal 90 is depressed. In the first step the automobile will be slowed down and clutch C will be disengaged automatically, and in the second step transmission T will be shifted to reverse as soon as the automobile comes to a complete stop, and then the automobile will be accelerated to move backwards. When the driver wants to move the automobile forwards after backing it up, he can first release accelerator pedal 90 and apply the brake, and second push down selector switch H and depress accelerator pedal 90. The transmission will be automatically shifted from reverse to the first gear. When the automobile comes to an u slope at a certain sped, say in fourth gear, the transmission will be automatically shifted down to the thrid gear as soon as the road speed falls below 40 Km he and the accelerator pedal is kept depressed to keep the trigger switch D11 closed However, if the driver wants to maintain a driving speed of over 40 Xm hr while m f 1 41e slope, he may push down selector switch n1 which enables the automobile to drive over 40 up to 45 Km hr in third gear, provided that the horsepower capacity of the engine is sufficient for maintaining that driving speed on that slope For steeper slopes selector switch L2 may be used.

This arrangement enables shift bars 331, 232 and B33 to be selectively locked onto slide block B4 when their respective solenoid valves V31, V32 and V33 are energized to actuate respective first, second or third auxiliary actuatorsA31, A32 and A33, so that the respective shift bars may be operated with slide block B4 and link B5 by second actuator AR.Knen solenoid valves V31, V32 and V33 are de energized, their respective shift bars B31, 1332 and B33 are freed to slide through slide block 34. Furthermore, shift bars B31, B32 and B33 are respectiv ely provided with third, fourth and fifth detectors D31, D32 and D33 which are adapted to deliver an electric signal to control unit U when slot B42 of each respective shift bar is in the neutral position. With this arrangement, the control unit U, upon receipt of the electric signals delivered by the third, fourth and fifth detectorsD31, D32 and D33 are so designed that only one of the three solenoid valves V31, V32 and V33 will be energized when all.of.the three shift bars B31, B32 and B33 are in the neutral position, and the solenoid valves V31, V32 and V33 will not be de energized unless their respective shift bars are in the neutral Position. Referring again to Fig. 16, frame T is provided with a projection T71 and a recess T72, said projection T71 being provided with a retaining rod T92 which is slidably inserted therethrough and fixedly supported by bracket T8 provided on the structural part of transmission T. Said retaining rod T92 is further provided with a pair of springs T91, one on each opposite side of projection T71, so as to resiliently retain said fram T4 in the neutral position N where recess T72 is aligned with the three fork like portions K1, K2 and K3 when the transmission is in the neutral position. As shown in Fig. 18, shift lever 64 is provided with an inner stick 64C slidably inserted therein, said inner stick 64C having a tapered lower end 64C1, and enlarged upper end 64C2, outer sleeve 64C4 fixed onto said enlarged upper end 64C2 and slidably passed over the upper end of shift lever 64, and a spring 64C3 adapted to urge said inner stick upwards. Outer sleeve 64C4 is provided with an elongated slot 64C5 through which a capscrew 64C6 is provided to slidably hold sleeve 6dC4 onto shift lever 64. Ball joint 64A is provided with a cavity 64E through which a latch plate 64D is slidably inserted. Latch 64D is provided with a slot 64D2 and a tongue 64D1 as shown in Fig. 19, and a spring 64D3 so disposed to urge said latch plate 64D outwards as shown in Fig. 18. Tapered end 64C1 of inner stick 64C is disposed in said slot 64D2 so as to normally allow tongue 64D1 of latch plate 64D to extend beyond the outer surface of ball joint 64A. ,wr,en inner stick 64C is pushed downwardly to cause tapered lower rod 6JC1 to further move into slot 64D2 of latch plate 64D, latch plate 54D is moved inwardly by the wedge action and tongue 64D1 is retracted into cavity 643. Swivel seat T5 is provided with a key T5A to be engaged with tongue 64D1 so as to retain shift lever 64 in a free position to be described below. SEnile the shift. bars B31, B32, and B33 are in the neutral position N, fork like portions K1, K2 and K3 are aligned with recess T72 of frame T4, thus enabling lower end 64B of shift lever to be moved into recess Y72 by pushing shift lever 64 further laterally. Above said key T5A is so disposed that when lower end 64B of shift lever 64 is engaged with fork like portion K1, which is immediately adjacent to recess T72, tongue 64D1 engages key T5A whereby the further lateral movement of lower end 64B of shi t lever 64 towards recess T72 is prevented.In other words, one must push inner stick 64C down to retract tongue 64D1 of latch plate 64D in order to move lower end 64B of shift lever 64 into recess T72. As soon as inner stick 64C is pushed down to retact latch plate 64D and lowere end 64B is moved into recess T72 of frame T4, latch plate 64D has moved over key T5A and can then be allowed to extend by releasing inner stick 64C then tongue 6 31 is again engaged with key T5A so as to prevent lower end 64B of shift lever 64 frorn moving apart from recess T72 without first pushing inner stick 64C downwards. The arrangement of latch plate 64D, recess T72 for keeping lower end 643 of shift lever 64 in a free position, or away from fork like portions K1, K2 and K3 enables the movements of. shift bars B31, B32 and 333 by the automatic shifting device of this invention without causing the shift lever to move while in automatic operation. In the event one wishes to switch from automatic operation to manual operation while shift lever 64 is in the above described free position, shift lever 64 may be moved in longitudinal direction first before pushing inner stick 64C downwards, so as to move frame Td longitudinally. The longitudinal movement of frame.Ta enables all fork like portions K1, K2 and K3 to be movedrnto the neutral position N to align with recess T72, so as to ensure that lower end 64 B of shift lever 64 engages with one of the fork like portions K1, K2 and K3 when making such a switch. Needless to say, the automatic operation can be performed without the need of mvoing shift lever 64 into the aforesaid free position. In the automatic operation, the device according to the second embodiment operation in the same manner as that of the first embodiment, except that in the second embodiment the selection of gear position is executed by energizing solenoid valves V31, V32 or V33 to lock appropriate shift bars B31, B32 or B33 into slide block 34 50 that the respective shift bars might be moved by second actuator A2, while in the first embodiment one of the two auxiliary solenoid valves V3 and V33 is to be energized in order to select one of the three shift bars B31, B32 and B33 to be moved by second actuator A2. Although a preferred embodiment employing a vacuum produced in the intake manifold of the engine of an automobile has been described and illustrated, however, it is to be understood that compressed air is equally applicable to the device of this invention with a re arrangement of actuators. The compressed an may be supplied from the compressed air system of the automobiles in which air brakes are employed. Furthermore, a pressurized fluid can be also be used in place of vacuum with a modification of actuators and with an addition of a return line from each actuator and each solenoid valve. The pressurized fluid may be supplied from the hydraulic system of the automobiles in which a hydraulic power steering or hydraulic power brakes are used. It is to be further understood that other modifications and re arrangement are possible by those having ordinary skill in the art, without departing from the principles and scope of this invention as defined in the appended claims.
