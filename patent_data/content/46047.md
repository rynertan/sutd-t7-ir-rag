# Polyamide printing plate having an improved contact with an image bearing film.

## Abstract
The contact of an image bearing film to the surface of a photosensitive polyamide printing plate is improved by forming an anti stickiness layer on the photosensitive polyamide layer, the anti stickiness layer comprising a polymer which is soluble or dispersible in a developer for the photosensitive polyamide, and having a thickness of 0.2 to 20 Âµ and having a matted surface.
