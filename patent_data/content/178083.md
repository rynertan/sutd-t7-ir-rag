# Assay technique and equipment.

## Abstract
An article and a technique for the assay of biochemical, bio logical or chemical species is disclosed. In essence, the article is a substrate 10 carrying a surface relief profile 12 such as a regular sinusoidal grating. There is usually a metal layer 13 e.g. of silver or aluminium conforming to the relief profile. An in organic oxide layer 14 may coat the metal layer 13 . A further layer of a dye tagged material 17 which is capable of binding the species undergoing assay is bonded to the structure. In use, the grating interacts with the fluorochrome by increasing ab sorption sensitivity and by regulating fluorescent emission into a narrow cone of angles instead of there being uniform emission in all directions. The presence of bound molecules e.g. anti bodies 18 on a layer of dye tagged antigen 17 affects the fluorescent behaviour of the system, which can be arranged to act as fluorescent activating on binding, or fluorescent inhibit ing on binding of assayed species. The fluorescent intensity or the lifetime of the fluorescent state may be measured before and after binding in order to monitor or measure the species un dergoing assay. In the preferred case, fluorescent is either quenched before binding of said species and activated after binding thereof, or vice versa. Also, the analyte may be dye tagged by conventional techniques rather than the layer of binding material 17 . The technique is well suited to liquid phase fluorescent immuno assay.
