# Ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystal composition and light switching element.

## Abstract
A ferroelectric chiral smectic liquid crystal composition containing two kinds of chiral smectic liquid crystal com pound is provided. One of the said compounds shows twist sense of helix of right handed and the other show twist sense of helix of left handed and the direction of spon taneous polarization of component chiral smectic liquid crystal compounds is the same. This composition provides a liquid crystal display element which shows very quick response.
