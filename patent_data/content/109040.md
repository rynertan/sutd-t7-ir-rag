# Heat resisting spheroidal graphite cast iron.

## Abstract
A heat resisting spheroidal graphite cast iron comprises carbon ranging from 1.8 to 3.4 by weight, silicon ranging from 3.5 to 6 by weight, manganese ranging from 0.7 to 1.25 by weight, chromium ranging from 3 to 5 by weight, nickel rang ing from 18 to 24 by weight, an element for spheroidizing graphite, not more than 0.1 by weight, and the balance being substantially iron, thereby attaining excellent oxidation resist ance and oxide film adherance characteristics while being kept inexpensive.
