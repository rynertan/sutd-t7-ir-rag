## Description
AUTOMATIC FIRE EXTINGUISHER Background of the invention a Field of the invention The present invention relates to an automatic fire extinguisher, and more particularly to an automatic fire exinguisher designed for detecting the occurrence of a fire to eject a fire extinguishing solution, and immediately for giving an alarm sound.b Description of the prior art There is hitherto a sprinkler for automatically sprinkling water when a room temperature reaches to an abnormally high temperature, as a counterplan upon the occurrence of fire. Such a conventional sprinkler, however, has such drawbacks that it inevitably requires a water piping, a pressure pvmp which are exclusively used for the sprinkler, and further a generator to be used for the interruption of electric supply which is apt to be occurred upon accident, which results in requirement of very expensive equipments. There has been proposed a fire extinguisher, as shown inUnited State Patent No. 4,299,289 granted to the same applicant as the present application, as a fire extinguisher for eliminating the above drawbacks of the conventional sprinkler. The above fire extinguisher has been designed such that when the room temperature increased to an abnormally high temperature is detected, a coil spring which is previously compressed by a holder is released from the holder to push a striker with a knife edge by means of the spring force of the coil spring against the seal of a tank filled with liquid carbon dioxide, thereby to break the seal of the tank, and then the fi e.xtingtlishing solution contained in the tank is ejected out from the puzzle of the tank by the aid of pressure of the evaporated gas.Further there is provided a heat fusible element between the holder and a screw adapted to apply pressing force to the holder, and if the heat fusible element is molten owing to the abnormally high temperature, the above mentioned compression condition of the coil spring is released. The fire extinguisher as mentioned above is designed to be secured to a ceiling and the like, and the number of the fire extinguishers is decided in accordance with the area of floor to be disposed with the fire extinguishers and the density of combustible objects. An alarm device for giving an alarm sound upon detection of abnormally high temperature within the room is sometimes used in conjunction with the fire extinguishers for the purpose of fire extinguishing operation at the initial stage of fire, however such alarm device operates by the mechanism independent and different from the fir extinguishers. Therefore it has been usual that the ejection of the fire extinguishing liquid from the fire extinguisher is made before the alarm sound by the alarm device, or vice versa. Further in the case where a plurality of the fire extinguishers are disposed, since the heat sensitive portion, i.e. heat sensor, of each fire extinguisher independently operates, even when the nearmost fire extinguisher from the position at which fire is occurred operates, it is usual that the fire extinguishers adjacent to the nearmost fire extinguisher do not operate until the heat sensor of each of the adjacent fire extinguishers detects the fact that the detecting temperature is reached to a predetermined operation temperature. Therefore there is a problem that in the case where a large amount of combustible objections is disposed at the position adjacent to the fire occurred position, it will be not possible to prevent the combustible objects from the spread of the fire. Summary of the invention A primary object of the present invention is to present an automatic fire extinguisher capable of an ejection of fire extinguishing solrt tion upon detection of an abnormally high temperature of a room, and simul taneously of giving an alarm sound. Another object of the present invention is to present an automatic fire extinguisher system designed such. that when one of plural fire extinguishers composing a group operates, other fire extinguishers within the group are also simultaneously operated. Brief description of the drawings The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiments of the present invention in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1 to 3 show an embodiment of an automatic fire extinguisber of the present invention Fig. 1 is a sectional view of the automatic fire extinguisher in a mounted condition, Fig. 2 is an enlarged sectional view of a heat sensitive portion in Fig. 1, and Fig. 3 is a circuit diagram for explaining the generation of alarm sound. Figs. 4 and 5 show another embodiment of an automatic fire extinguisher of the present invention Fig. 4 is an enlarged sectional view of a heat sensitive portion and Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram for explaining the simultaneous operation of a grouped fire extinguishers. Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiments Referring to Figs. 1 to 3 an embodiment of the present invention is shown. In Fig. 1, numeral 10 designates a vessel contained with liquid carbon dioxide as pressure applying medium. The vessel 10 has a foremost part provided with a cap 12 for sealing. The vessel 10 is housed within a casing 14 with the foremost part downwards. The casing 14 has a mounting fixture 16 at the upper end and is designed to be secured to the rafter 20 of the ceiling at the mounting fixture by the screws 18. An inner cylincrical connector 22 is fitted to the foremost part of the gas vessel 10 as shown in Fig. 1. A striker 24 having a knife edge 26 for breaking the sealing cap 12 at the end point of the striker 24 is mounted slidably axially within the connector 22 in the case of a fire.An O ring 28 is interposed between the gas vessel 10 and the inner connector 22, and another O ring 30 id also interposed between the striker 24 and the inner connector 22 as shown in Fig. 1. An outer connector 32 is fitted on the inner connector 22 and sealed therefrom by a pair of O rings 34 and 36 at the upper and lower positions respectively. The outer connector 32 has a central flange portion 38 and is engaged by an upper nut 40 and a lower nut 42. Numeral 44 designates a toroidal or dJubhnut shaped tank for receiving the fire extinguishing solution. The upper and lower flanges 46 and 50 of the tank 44 Åare connected to the central flange portion 38 of the outer connector 32 through seal wemµtB 48 and 52 respectively.The outer connector 32 is formed with a plurality of radial gas conduits 45 for directing the gas within the gas vessel 10 into the tank 44 containing the fire extinguishing solution. When the sealing cap 12 is broken by impact afforded by the striker 24, the gas it the vessel 10 flows into the tank 44 filled with.a fire extinguishing solution 45. The gas contained in the gas vessel 10 may be supplied to the conduits 56 by way of ports or orifices 60 formed in the inner connector 32. These ports 60 are usually closed by a tube or valve 62 made ofltubbet dr similar material which is fitted into the ports 60. The 3alive 62 may be ruptured only when the carbon dioxide gas has been ejected from the gas vessel 10 to permit the carbon dioxide gas to flow into the tank 44. The fire extinguishing solution 45 within the tank 44 may be ejected into the space below through a nozzle device 64 along with the carbon dioxide gas contained in the gas vessel 10. The nozzle device 64 has, as shown in Fig. 1, a dome shape configuration formed with a number of ejection openings 86 and a diaphragm 70 made of rubber or similar material. Th e diaphragm 70 is designed for normally blocking the fire extinguishing solution 45 from flowing therethrough and to be ruptured only when the liquid carbon dioxide contained under elevated pressure within the gas vessel 10 flows into the tank 44 upon breakage of the sealing cap 12 to permit the fire extinguishing solution 45 to flow into the space therebelow along with the carbon dioxide gas. Numeral 72 designates a frame fixed to the outer connector 32 at the upper end portion thereof. Within the frame 72, a hammer 74 for impinging the striker 24 and a compression coil spring 76 acting resiliently on the hameer 74 are disposed. A holder 77 is secured at the upper end thereof to the hammer 74 and engaged at the inclined lower end of the holder 77 by the lower end 73 of the frame 72 so as to retract the hammer 74 downwards against the force of the compression coil spring 76. A guide member 78 is threadedly mounted to the hammer 76 for guiding the coil spring 76 into contact with the lower face of a flange 80 of the hammer 74. Numeral 84 designates a heat sensitive portion for detecting the abnonnally high temperature within the room. The heat sensitive portion 84 is interposed between the holder 77 and a screw 82 disposed at the lower end portion of the frame 72. The screw 82 is disposed to press the holder 77 against the inclined surface 73 of the frame 72 thereby to lock the holder 77.The heat sensitive portion 84 composed of a heat insulating means ber 86 contacting the holder 77, a heat sensitive plate 89 having a heat conducting portion 88 extending toward the outer space of the fire extinguisher body and secured to the heat insulating member 86, a tubular member 92 secured to the heat sensitive plate 89 and having aheat fusible element 90 therein, and a plunger 94 having one end contacting with the heat fusible element 90 contained within a tubular member and the other end engaging to the screw.82. The heat fusible element 90 is made of low melting alloy material havinga melting point of about 720C.The lower portion of the holder 77 is bent to be able to engage the inclined surface 73 of the frame 72, and the holder 77 may be engaged to the frame 72 through the heat sensitive portion 84 by means of the compression force due to the set screw 82, thereby holding the spring 76 in a compressed condition. When the low melting alloy material.melts, the engagement be . tween the holder 77 and the frame 72 is released to push up the striker 24 by the hammer 74 by way of the resilienttforce due to lithe spring 76. Further there is provided in the frame 72 a through hole 96 at the position corresponding to the lower end portion of the striker 24, as shown in Fig. 1, and a plate like member 98 is inserted within the through hole 96. The plate like member 98 has one end which is bent at the peri pheral surface of the frame 72, and a microswich 100 is fixed at the bent portion of the plate like member 98. The other end portion of the plate like member 98 is also bent at the peripheral surface of the frame 72, and an opening 102 is formed at the central portion of the plate like member 98 to permit a free passage of the lower end portion of the striker 24.The microswitch 100 is moved upward direction along with the plate like member 98 when the hamner 74 impinges the lower end portion of the striker 24, and designed to be actuated tolON state when the microswitch 100 contacts to the lower surface of the lower nut member 42. The microswitch 100 is used for the purpose of actuating a bazzer 104 secured to the casing 14 for giving alarm sound. Referring to Fig. 3 a circuit diagram for actuating the buzzer 104 is shown. As is apparent from Fig. 3, the microswitch 100, buzzer 104, and an electric power source 106 are connected in series thereby giving the alarm sound due to the buzzer 104 upon the actuation of the microswitch 100. The generation of the alarm sound is almost simultaneous with the initiatoin of the ejection due to the automatic fire extinguisher. According to the automatic fire extinguisher of the present invention thus constructed, the synchronization between the generation of alarm soudntand the initiation of ejection means the fact that an initial fire xtitguishing action is made no sooner than the generation of alarm sound because of fire occurrence, and further a real fire extinguishing action may immediately start even if the initial fire cannot completely be extin wished by the initial fire extinguishing action. Referring now to operation of the present invention, when the room temperature reaches to an abnormally high temperature such as about 720C because of fire and similar phenomenon, the heat sensitive plate 89 also becomes to high temprature and the heat of the heat sensitive plate 89 is quickly transmitted to the low melting alloy material 90 through the tubular member 92, because the transmission of the heat in the counterdirection to the tubular member 92 is disconnected by the heat insulating member 86, thereby to melt the low melting alloy material 90.When the mow melting alloy material 90 is melted thereby to be deformed the compression force by which the holder 77 is compressed to the frame 72 is eliminated to disconnect the engagement therebetween, and then the hammer 74 moves upwardly by zthe resilient force due to the spring 76. The hammer 74 pushes up the lower end portion of the striker 24 and further the plate like member 98 fixed with the microswitch 100 is also moved upwardly. The knife edge 26 formed at the upmost portion of the striker 24 opens the sealing cap 12 of the gas vessel 10, and further actuator of the microswitch 100 is depressed by the lower surface of the lower nut 42 thereby to make the microswitch 100 ON state and to give alarm sound due to the buzzer 104. The carbon dioxide gas ejected by opening of the sealing cap 12 passes bhrough the conduits or orifices 60, the backward flow preventing valve 62 and the gas conduits 56 to reach to the tank 44 containing the fire distinguishing solution 45, and the solution 45 is compressed to break down the diaphragm 70 of the nozzle dEvices 64 and to eject the solution 45 from the down shaped cap, or ejection holes 66, to the room. The electric power source 106 to be used for the embodiment of the present invention may be the dry battery usually sold at a market, but is is preferable at a point of view of avoiding a natural discharge of the electric power to use a lithium battery. Further a magnetoelectric buzzer is preferable for the buzzer 104, and the microswitch 100 is used in the above embodiment as means for accuratley actuating the buzzer 104 in synchronism with the initiation of the ejection of the fire extinguishing solution, however the present invention should not be limited to the microswitch but may be means for accurately closing the circuit for the buzzer immediately upon detection of movement of the holder 77 or the striker 24.For example, it may be designed that a switch is composed of a pair of conductors, one is mounted on the upper end portion of the hammer 74 and the other is mounted on the lower end portion of the striker 24, and the switch thus arranged may be turned to ON state by contact of the hammer 74 and the striker 24. Further, it also may be designed that there is provided an elongated through slit at the frame 72 and d projection formed at the portion of the upper end portion of the hammer 74, the projection being projected through the elongated slits and then the microswitch 100 is pressed by the projection of the hammer 74 upon striking of the hammer 74 against the striker 24. As mentioned above, the main body of the automatic fire extinguisher according to the present invention is mounted inside of the ceiling 140 of the room, therefore the lower portion of the frame 72 including the heat sensitive plate 89 and the nozzle device 64 including the solution ejecting hole 66 are merely exposed from the ceiling 140, thus the main bandy nf tile fire est ewling ,sher except the cxpoed portions to the room is disposed behind a cover 142, so that a fine view of the room is not failed. Referring now to Figs. 4 and 5, another embodiment of the automatic fire extinguisher of the present invention is shown. The fire extinguishing system of the embodiment is designed such that a plurality of automatic fire extinguishers are diveded into some group, in each group a plurality of automatic fire extinguishers have the same construction as others in the group. The automatic fire extinguishing system is designed such that when one of the automatic fire extinguishers in a single group operates in response to the abnormally high temperature of the room, all of other automatic fire extinguishers in the group are operated in synchronism with each other.Each fire extinguisher according to the automatic fire extinguishing system has essentially the same configuration as that shown in the embodiment of Figs. 1 and 2, escept such construction that nichrome wires 212 as a heat emitting body are disposed adjacent to theslow melting allow material 218 in the heat sensitive portion 200. Thus, the heat sensitive portion 200 is composed of heat insulating member 210 contacting to the holder 77, a heat sensitive plate 214 fixed at the surface of the heat insulating member 210 opposite to the surface contacting to the holder 77, and a tubular member 216 secured to the heat sensitive plate 214 and filled with the low melting alloy material, i.e. a low temperature solder 218 therein, the low temperature solder 218 being sealed by a plunger 220.The plunger 220 is pressed by a set screw 222 mounted on the frame 72 thereby contacting the holder 77 against the frame 72 by means of the compression force due to the set screw 222. The nichrome wires 212 are disposed at the space enclosed by the heat insulating member 210, and has a small air gap from the heat sensitive plate 214. Further the nichrome wires 212 emit heat upon application of electric power, and the emitted heat energy is transmitted to the low temperature solder 218 through the heat sensitive plate 214 and the tubular member 216, thereby to melt the low temperature solder 218. The transmission of the heat energy is prevented in the direction towards the holder 77 by the heat insulating member 210, therefore the heat energy is effectively transmitted to the low temperature solder 218.The low temperature solder 218 is usually depressed to the tubular member 216 through the plunger 22 by the set screw 222, but when the solder 218 is molten by receiving the heat energy due to the heated nichrome wires 212, the pressing force applied to the holder 77 is eliminated thereby to release the inclined surface 78 of the holder 77 from the frame 74. As mentioned above the low temperature solder 218 is applied with pressing force through the plunger 220 by the set screw 222, and a deformation of the low temperature solder 218 is scarcely occurred except the deformation due to the abnormally high temperature,therefore if the set screw 222 is fixedly set, the inclined surface 78 of the holder 77 is fixedly engaged with the lower end portion of the frame 72.This insures that any malfunction of the automatic fire extinguisher due to a physical characteristic of the low temperature solder 218 does not occur. Referring toFi. 5 a connection condition between the nichrome wires 212A to 212F and the switches 100A to 100F of the six automatic fire extinguishers composing one group of the automatic fire extinguishing system is shown. One end of each nichrome wire out of the wires 212A, 212B, 212C...212F is connected to one end of each of the corresponding microswitches 100A, 100B, 100C...100F and to one end of the buzzer 104 which is used in common. The other end of each nichrome wire is connected to one end of the electric power 106, and the other end of each microswitch is connected to the other end of the electric power 106. It may be sufficient to connect the buzzer 104 to either one of the fire extinguishers composing the single group.In the above embodiment shown in Fig. 5 one group composed of six fire extinguishers is shown, it also may be designed to compose one automatic fire extinguishing system having a plurality of groups of the automatic fire extinguishers in accordance with the area of the floor of the room to be provided with the automatic fire extinguishing system and the density of combustible objects. According to the automatic fire extinguishing system composed of plural groups thus designed, in case of occurrence of fire only one automatic fire extinguisher of a single group, which is most near to the occurrence position of fire, is operated by the fact that the heat sensitive portion of the nearmost fire extinguisher is actuated in response to the abnormally high temperature of the room.Namely the heat conducting portion of the heat sensitive plate 214 is heated, and the heat is effectively transmitted to the low temperature solder 218, and then when the temperature of the solder 218 reaches to a predetermined temperature about 720C, the compression force applied to the frame 72 through the holder 77 is eliminated because of the melting ot the low temperature solder 218 thereby to release the holder 77 from the frame 72. Then the hammer 74 moves upwardly by the resilient force due to the spring 76 to strike the lower end portion of the striker 24. As a result, the microswitch fixing plate 98 is also moved upwardly to actuate the microswitch 100, which results in the close state of the microswitch 100.The microswitch may be one of the zix microswitches 100A, lOOB, 100C...1WF shown in Fig. 5, and by closing one microswitch all nichrome wires 212A, 212B, 212C...212F within one group are connected to the electric power 100 by closing the electric circuit connecting the nichrome wires to the electric power 106, and further the electric circuit connecting the buzzer 104 to the electric power 106 is also closed thereby to give alarm sound. As a result, all of the six nichrome wires within the same group are heated to actuate all of six fire extinguishers within the same group and to eject the solution from all of six tanks thereof, even though the ambient temperature does not reach to the predetermined temperature with respect to at least four fire extinguishers.Alarm sound due to the buzzer 104 is also given at the same time as the initiation of the ejection of the fire extinguishing solution. According to the automatic fire extinguishing system thus operated, the spread of fire of combustible objects disposed within the region covered by one group of the fire extinguishers can be entirely prevented. However the fire extinguishers of other group or groups does not operate to eject the solution thereof, until the ambient temperature reaches to the predetermined temperature. Further the number of the fire extinguishers composing one group may be freely decided in accordance with the condition of floor, therefore in the case of the floor having large density of combustible objects the single group may be composed more many fire extinguishers. Iti the embodiment of Fig. 4 the heat sensitivewplate 214 is formed in L letter shape in section and made of copper, and it is of course necessary to design the area of the heat conducting portion expanded outside the main body of the fire extinguisher in view of thermal capacity of the material used for the heat conducting portion, in order to be able to transmit the heat energy due to abnormally high temperature to the low temperature solder 218. Further in the embodiment a usual nichrome wire is used as a heat generating body, however the present invention should not be limited to a nichrome wire, but any material capable of generating heat required for melting the low temperature solder by applying electric power can be usable. The figures used in the claims are only meant to explain more clearly the intention of the invention and are not supposed to be any restriction concerning the interpretation of the invention.
