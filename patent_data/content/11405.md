# Semiconductor memory.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory is formed of a plurality of memory cells, which are connected to different points along first and second word lines. To prevent differences in the amplitudes of the hold currents in the different memory cells due to word line resistance, according to the present inven tion the areas of emitters E
