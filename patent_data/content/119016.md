# Multiple precision floating point unit.

## Abstract
The floating point unit is constructed of two or more identical modules, each with a file of registers FPRF 411 for floating point data, a sign and exponent processing unit SEL 423 , a mantissa processing unit MAU 431 and a shift unit WRS 439 used in normalizing and other shift operations and in storing intermediate results. Each module is capable of processing single precision data with operands from two registers placed on two input buses FA 415 and FB 417 and the result returned via an output bus FD 437 . However, for double precision data two modules used the sign and exponent processing unit of the second module is rendered inoperative by a first selection signal SPM DPM and the two mantissa units act as one. To this end interconnections provide for inputs into the guard bit positions of the input buses FA 1 g and FB 1 g from the sign and exponent bit positions of the second module FA 2 s e and FB 2 s e and for return of corresponding bits on the output bus FD 1 g to FD 2 s e . Also the second mantissa unit carry ACRY 2 propagates into the first mantissa unit as BCRY 1 . A second selection signal SP DP selects between such double precision operation and single precision opera tion in which the mantissa unit of the second module is rendered inoperative by forcing it to process zero operands. Using more than two modules it is possible to select operations from 1 up to N precision where N is the number of modules.
