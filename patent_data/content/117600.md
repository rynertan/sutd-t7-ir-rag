## Description
ANTI BACTERIAL METHOD This invention concerns the treatment of bacterial diseases of plants. Conventionally, bacterial diseases of plants, such as greening of oranges, blackarm disease of cotton, fireblight in pears and apples, bacterial rot in vegetables and bacterial blight in rice, have been treated by means of antibiotic compounds such as streptomycin, tetracycline or penicillin, or by other antibacterial compounds such as bronopol, mercury compounds or copper complexes. We have found that the action of these compounds can be significantly and unexpectedly increased if the compounds are used in conjunction with the enzyme hyaluronidase, which itself has no antibacterial activity. Accordingly, in one aspect, this invention provides a method of combating bacterial diseases of plant material which comprises applying thereto an effective amount of one or more antibacterial compounds and a potentiating amount of hyaluronidase. The compounds will preferably be applied together, but they may be applied separately, in which case the application of the hyaluronidase desirably precedes that of the antibacterial compound. The invention also provides an antibacterial composition which comprises one or more antibacterial compounds and a potentiating amount of hyaluronidase. On large plants, and especially trees, it may be convenient and most efficacious to inoculate the plant with the hyaluronidase through the stem. However, the hyaluronidase may alternatively be applied by conventional spraying techniques, and this is the method of choice with smaller plants. When seeds are to be treated, it is convenient to dust, coat or pellet the seeds with an appropriate composition containing the hyaluronidase and the antibacterial compound. Among the bacteria which may be combated by the present invention are Agrobacterium tumefaciens crown gall , Corynebacterium fascious leafy gall , C. betae,C. xerosis, Erwinia amylovora fireblight , E. carotovora bacterial rots of vegetables , Pseudomonas angulata,P. morsprunorum, P. syringae, P. lachrymans,P. phaseolicola, Xanthomonas campestris, X malvacearum,X. oryzae and X. hyacinthi. Among the plant materials which may be treated are vegetables, cotton, rice, apples, pears, oranges, lemons and other citrus fruit. The antibacterial compound may be applied in the present invention at rates which are generally lower than those at which it is normally applied. The actual rate of application will depend, however, on the plant species to be treated, the nature and severity of the bacterial disease, and the desired effect. In general from 0.3 to 15 g, especially 1 to 5 g, of the antibacterial compound are applied per square metre of the drip area of the plants or trees. The term drip area is used herein to denote, as a measure of the size of a plant or tree, the area of ground which is a vertical projection of the foliage thereon. A wetted plant or tree drips excess moisture within this area. The hyaluronidase is preferably employed at a rate of 0.3 to 15 mg, especially 1 to 5 mg, per square metre of the drip area of the plants or trees. The ratio of the antibacterial compound s to the hyaluronidase is preferably from 250 1 4000 1, especially 500 1 to 2000 1, by weight. The antibacterial compound and the hyaluronidase will normally be employed in the form of compositions containing a surface active agent and or a carrier. The compositions will normally be produced initially containing from 0.5 to 99 , preferably from 0.5 to 85 , and more usually from 10 to 50 by weight of the present compounds, which are diluted if necessary before application to the locus to be treated such that the concentration of active ingredient in the fqrmulation applied is from 0.05 to 5 by weight. The carrier may be water, in which case an organic solvent may also be present, though this is not usually employed. A flowable suspension concentration may be formed by grinding the compound with water, a wetting agent and a suspending agent, e.g. xanthan gum. The carrier may alternatively be a water immiscible organic solvent, e.g. a hydrocarbon which boils within the range 130 270 C, e.g. xylene, in which the compound is dissolved or suspended. An emulsifiable concentrate containing a water immiscible solvent may be formed with a surface active agent so that the concentrate acts as a self emulsifiable oil on admixture with water. The carrier may alternatively be a water miscible organic solvent e.g. 2 methoxy ethanol, methanol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, formamide or methylformamide. The carrier may alternatively be a solid, which may be finely divided or granular. Examples of suitable solids are limestone, clays, sand, mica, chalk, attapulgite, diatomite, perlite, sepiolite, silicas, silicates, lignosulphonates and solid fertilizers. The carrier can be of natural or synthetic origin or can be modified natural material. Wettable powders soluble or dispersible in water may be formed by admixing the compound in particulate fqrm with a particulate carrier or spraying molten compound on to the particulate carrier, admixing a wetting agent and a dispersing agent and finely grinding the whole powder mixture. An aerosol composition may be formed by admixing the compound with a propellant, e.g. a polyhalogenated alkane such as dichlorofluoromethane, and suitably also with a solvent. The term surface active agent is used in the broad sense to include materials variously called emulsifying agents, dispersing agents and wetting agents. Such agents are well known in the art. The surface active agents used may comprise anionic surface active agents, for example mono or di esters of phosphoric acid with a fatty alcohol ethoxylate, or salts of such esters, fatty alcohol sulphates such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, ethoxylated alkylphenol sulphonates, lignin sulphates, petroleum sulphonates, alkylaryl sulphonates such as alkyl benzene sulphonates or lower alkylnapithalene sulphonates, salts of sulphonated nqhthaleneformaldehyde condensates, or more complex sulphonates such as the amide sulphonates, e.g. the sulphonated condensation product of oleic acid andN methyl taurine or the dialkyl sulphosuccinates e.g.the sodium sulphonate of dioctyl succinate. The surface active agents may also comprise non ionic agents, for example condensation products of fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, fatty acid amides or alkyl substituted phenols with ethylene oxide, fatty esters of polyhydric alcohol ethers e.g. sorbitan fatty acid esters, condensation products of such esters with ethylene oxide e.g. polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, acetylenic glycols such as 2,4,7,9tetramethyl 5 decyn 4,7 diol, or ethoxylated acetylenic glycols The surface active agents may also comprise cationic agents, for example alkyl and or aryl substituted quaternary ammonium compounds such as cetyl trimethylammoniun bromide, or ethoxylated tertiary fatty amines. Preferred surface active agents include ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulphates, lignin sulphonates, alkyl aryl sulphonates, salts of sulphonated napthaleneformaldehyde condensates, salts of sulphonated phenolformaldehyde condensates, sodium oleoyl N methyltauride, dialkyl sulphosuccinates, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and fatty alkyl ethoxylates. If desired, the antibacterial compounds and the hyaluronidase may be supplied in a pack which contains each in a separate container so that the components may be mixed immediately prior to use or used consecutively. The invention is further described, though only by way of illustration, in the following Example.Example Four holes were drilled into the xylem of the trunks of each of 15 citrus trees for each of the treatments set out below. For each treatment about 4 litres of the relevant solution was injected via these holes so as to give a dosage rate of 3 grams of tetracycline hydrochloride per square metre of drip area of the tree about 12 grams of tetracycline per tree . Four hours after treatment, 100 leaves per tree were picked, and 7 mm square leaf samples were cut therefrom and placed in a petri dish containing a culture of Bacillus brevis. Twenty four hours later, the percentage inhibition of Bacillus brevis was recorded, the results obtained being as set out below Treatment Inhibition Tetracycline hydrochloride 20 Tetracycline hydrochloride 55 z ampoule hyaluronidase 750 I.U. Treatment Inhibition Tetracycline hydrochloride 100 1 ampoule hyaluronidase 1500 I .U. Untreated Control O This demonstrates the greatly improved distribution of the tetracycline hydrochloride within the trees due to the hyaluronidase.
