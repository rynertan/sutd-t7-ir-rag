## Description
DESCRIPTION IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO WORK STATIONS. The present invention relates to a portable work station, particularly suitable for home use by the home handyman. It can also be used for commercial industrial use, i.e. on site or maintainance work. It is frequently necessary to perform operations on wood, metal, or other such materials, where it would be advantagedus to have some form of structure for holding either the materials to be operated on or the tools for operating on them, or both. Unfortunately, no such apparatus is available which is particularly suited to a variety of uses. Most proprietory pieces of equipment are suited to performing only a specific function, be it wood working lathe, drill stand, clamp, workbench or the like. A known work station comprises a stand having a spine through which a leadscrew extends. One swivel jaw can be removably coupled to a nut on the leadscrew whilst another swivel jaw is removably attached to the spine at any one of a number of preselected locations. Such a work station is no more than a vice and the spine is fixed relatively to its supporting frame. An object of the present invention is to provide a multi purpose work station which avoids the need for several pieces of apparatus, each of which is only capable of a specific job. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi purpose portable work station comprising a hollow spine having disposed therein a rotatable longitudinally extending leadscrew or threaded rod on which is received a correspondingly threaded nut which is saidable longitudinally within the central hollow spine upon rotation of the leadscrew, the central spine having therein at least one longitudinally extending slot by means of which a headstock for a workpiece, tool or accessory is securable to the nut so as to be movable therewith, and a tailstock is arranged to be slidably carried and releasably secured to the central spine. Preferably, the central hollow spine is square or rectangular in cross section, and has a longitudinally extending slot in three of the sides, whereby three headstock sockets can be secured to the nut for securing headstocks thereto. Preferably three tailstock sockets are provided on a single saddle or support member which comprises a hollow section slidably received on the central hollow spine. Clamping means are provided for securing the tailstock in a desired position. Mounting means are provided for the central spine and this preferably comprises two frame end members or stands, conveniently made from tubular section material. Each frame end member has a tubular or round spigot attached thereto which is adapted for co operating engagement with a tubular sleeve carried by the spine. Each end of the spine is provided with a tubular sleeve, so that, when a frame end member is fitted at each end, the spine may be mounted horizontally. The frame end members can be provided with leg extensions to facilitate floor or bench mounting. The spigot and the tubular sleeve permit the spine to be rotated relative to the stands so that any one of the three accessory location points can be uppermost.The spine can be mounted vertically by placing the stand on a horizontal. surface. The spine can also be used without the stand leg extensions as particular workstations may require. The head stock and tailstock sockets can be arranged to accept a wide variety of fittings as will be described further hereinafter. The number of uses can be increased beyond those specified as further accessory types are developed. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a multi purpose portable work station comprising a stand which includes an angularly adjustable hollow spine having a leadscrew extending longitudinally thereof, and at least two saddles slidably mounted on said spine, at least one such saddle being coupled to a nut on said leadscrew and at least one other such saddle being provided with means for clamping it in an adjusted position on the spine, each saddle including at least one socket which is directed outwardly with respect to the spine and which is adapted to detachably receive a complementarily shaped spigot or the like on an attachment, such as Ã  workpiece support or clamping jaw or on a tool or tool holder. Preferably, the spine is angularly adjustable through 3600 about its longitudinal axis and can be locked in any desired position.Advantageously, the spine is square or rectangular in section, and has a longitudinal slot through which extends a part connecting the nut on the leadscrew to the corresponding saddle. it is convenient to make each saddle of short tubular construction whose interior closely matches the exterior of the spine. In the case of the or each saddle which is clampable to the spine, the clamp preferably comprises a thumbscrew which extends through a corner of the saddle in the direction of the corresponding diagonal of the cross section of the spine. In this way, the saddle can be firmly clamped by means of a single thumbscrew to render the saddle completely immovable relative to the spine. Each of the sockets can be of square or rectangular cross section but is preferably of circular section so that the corresponding attachment can be fitted in any desired angular position about the axis of the socket. In such case, the spigot or the like on the attachment would be a circular spigot or a round tube. Each such socket is provided with clamping means in the form of a thumbscrew which can be tightened against the spigot or the like on the attachment. The stand preferably comprises a folding frame whose hinge axis is close to the longitudinal axis of the stand. In the preferred embodiment, each saddle has at least two sockets which are at right angles to one another and to the longitudinal direction of the spine. It is usually preferred that the corresponding sockets on all of the saddles should be parallel to one another in order that the attachments, that is to say, supports, clamping jaws, tools and or tool holders, mounted on the saddles can be properly aligned with one another. In the use of the work station according to the invention as a lathe, one attachment is in the form of a headstock bracket adapted to mount a conventional electric drill and another attachment is in the form of a tailstock dimensioned so as to be aligned with the drill axis. The tailstock can be mounted on the saddle which is coupled to the leadscrew and the head stock can be mounted on a saddle lockable to the spine but a converse arrangement is of course possible. In the use of the work station as a drill stand, an attachment can be provided which comprises a tubular column adapted to be fitted in one of the sockets and having mounted thereon a conventional electric drill mounting to enable the electric drill to be displaced upwardly and downwardly lengthwise of the column by means of the usual lever. A workpiece support plate for such stand in the form of another attachment can be fitted to another socket on the same saddle as the column or to a socket on another saddle. In the use of the work station as a work bench or vice, clamping jaws can be provided as attachments on two saddles which can be moved towards or away from one another to effect a clamping operation for clamping a workpiece upon which it is desired to perform a working operation, such as sawing. In the use of the portable workstation as a mechanical saw, an attachment in the form of a table can be fitted to one of the saddles, such table having therebeneath a bracket to which a conventional electric drill may be fitted so that a circular saw blade attached to the chuck of the electric drill protrudes through a slot provided in the table. The angular displaceability of the spine enables the attachments tools, clamps, workpieces, etc. to be disposed at a suitable orientation for the working operation to be performed. When drilling holes, for example, in large panels it may be convenient to lay the panels on the frame beneath the spine and to turn the spine so that the drill hangs downwardly therefrom for drilling holes in the panel. Likewise, when using the portable work station as a clamp or vice, the clamp or vice can be arranged vertically or horizontally or at any other desired angle to facilitate the sawing or other operation to be performed. The invention is further described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a partially exploded perspective view of one embodiment of work station according to the invention Figure 2 is a diagrammatic sectional view of the central spine Figure 3 is a diagrammatic view showing the connection of the headstock Figures 4 and 5 show the central spine horizontally mounted with short and long legs respectively Figure 6 is an end view of the work station of Fig.1, showing some different angular positions of the spine Figures 7 to 11 illustrate some of the accessories which can be used with the work station of Fig.l Figures 12 to 14 illustrate the work station of Fig.l in the vertical position with some of the accessories Figures 15 and 16 show pipe and strip metal bending and rolling accessories Fig.17 is a perspective view of a second embodiment of workstation according to the invention set up as a lathe Fig.18 is a detailed perspective view of the work station of Fig.17, but set up as a drill stand Fig.19 is a perspective view of a detail of the work station of Fig.17, but set up as a mechanical saw Fig.20 is a detailed perspective view of the work station of Fig.17, but set up as a vice or workpiece clamp Fig.21 is a fragmentary sectional view showing one of the saddles of the work station of Figs.17 to 20 Fig.22 is a fragmentary sectional view showing another of the saddles and Fig.23 is a fragmentary longitudinal sectional view of the spine of the work station of Figs.17 to 20. Referring to Figs. 1 to 16 of the drawings, there is shown one embodiment of a multi purpose portable work station. The work station comprises a spine 1 which, as illustrated, has a generally rectangular cross section and is hollow. A longitudinally extending slot 3 is formed in three of the sides of the central spine. A longitudinally extending leadscrew 5 see Figs. 2 and 3 is disposed within the hollow spine and is journalled for rotation therein.The leadscrew 5 is rotated by revolving a handle 7 which drives the leadscrew by way of bevel gears 9.The gearing may be adjusted by changing the gears 9.Two alternative gear ratios may be mounted in line on the central rotatable.leadscrew. The winding handle could be moved from one driving shaft to the other according to the ratio required. A threaded nut 11 is received on the leadscrew and is slidable within the hollow spine. Rotation of the nut 11 may be prevented by arranging for the nut 11 to contact the sides of the hollow spine. The threaded nut carries at least one headstock socket 13, and preferably three, as shown in the described embodiment. The mounting for each socket 13 passes through a respective one of the slots 3 and the mounting of the three headstock sockets in this way can serve to prevent rotation of the nut 11. Rotation of the handle 7 causes the headstock socket s to move in the axial direction of the spine. The spine 1 also carries one or more tailstock sockets 15, three in the described embodiment, and these are received on a hollow tubular member or saddle 17 which is slidably guided on the central spine 1. Clamping means not illustrated may be provided for securing the saddle 17 and hence the tailstock socket s 15 in a desired axial position. Each end of the spine 1 is provided with a tubular mounting 19 which is adapted for co operating engagement with a complementarily shaped spigot 23 of a mounting stand 21. Two mounting stands 21 are shown in Figure 1 and these are conveniently fabricated from tubular steel or the like material, and have two legs formed by a U shaped member, the legs of which are preferably splayed outwardly. The spigot 23 is secured to the legs so that its axis is perpendicular to the plane of the two legs. The spine 1 may be mounted horizontally by utilizing both stands 21 as a support, or vertically by utilising just one stand and upending the spine, so that the plane of the legs is horizontal and leg extensions 25 are provided which slot into respective legs of the stands so that the spine is at a convenient height when supported on the floor see Figs. 4 and 5 . The tubular sleeve 19 and spigot 23 enable the spine to be rotated relative to the mounting stand or stands. Thus any of the three pairs of headstocks tailstocks can be positioned as desired see Fig.6 .Clamping means 27 is provided for securing the spine 1 in the desired angular position. The headstock and tailstock sockets 13,15 are constructed in the form of open ended rectangular boxes. This form of construction enables a number of accessories to be fitted to the headstocks or tailstocks by means of complementarily shaped mounting blocks. The accessories include power drill holder 31 tailstock centre 33 vice attachments 35 strip metal and pipe bending and rolling attachments 37 universal clamp and tool holder attachment 39 and various support brackets 41. Figures 7 and 8 show the work station of Fig.l adapted for use as a vice with clamping action and push apart action respectively. Figure 9 shows a lathe set up. Figures 10 and 15 show pipe bending arrangements, whilst Figures 11 and 16 show strip metal bending attachment. Figure 13 shows the work station of Fig.l set up as a drill stand and Figures 12 and 14 show general views of a vertical arrangement for lifting and the like. The spine is preferably about 1 m long, although it can be manufactured in various sizes and strengths according to its intended market section, i.e. do it yourself or industrial. Referring now to Fig.17, a portable work station comprises a frame 10 which includes a longitudinal spine 12. ,The spine 12 is journalled at its opposite ends to respective frame members 14 and 16. Each frame end member 14 or 16 comprises a leg 18 and a leg 20. The legs 18 are interconnected by a brace 22 and the legs 20 are interconnected by a brace 24, the braces being releasably secured to the legs by bolts 124 and butterfly nuts. Respective upper plates 26 are releasably hinged to the legs 18 by bolts.118 and butterfly nuts and the legs 20 are secured to the plates 26 by bolts 120 and butterfly nuts 122. The legs leg 18 and 20 of each frame member 14 are interconnected by further collapsible braces 28 formed of hinged links 30 and 32. The frame is thus collapsible inasmuch as the links 30 and 32 can be hinged upwardly to bring the legs 20 against the legs 18. A projection 32a on an extension of the link 32 engages the link 30 to lock the frame in an open position. Each of the plates 26 has welded thereto a bearing bush 34 in which is received a corresponding tubular spigot 134 Fig.23 welded to an end plate 135, 136 which is in turn, welded to the respective end of the spine 12. The spine 12 can thereby be rotated to any desired angular position and can be locked therein by means of a thumbscrew 36 threadably received in each of the bearing tubes 34. The spine 12 comprises a square section tube along whose centre extends a leadscrew 46 Figs.21 and 23 journalled at its ends in the end plates 135 ,136. The leadscrew can be turned by means of a handle 38 which is attached by a pin 137 to the outer end of a shaft extension 138. The left hand end of the leadscrew 46 terminates in a spigot 146 which is received in a blind bore in the end plate 136. The right hand end of the leadscrew 46 comprises the shaft extension 138 of reduced diameter which extends through oversize holes 126 and 133 in the plates 26 and 135 respectively.These holes are sufficiently large to enable the threaded portion of the leadscrew 46 to pass through during assembly. A brass bush 139 is slipped over the shaft extension 138 and is secured by a transverse pin 140. The bush 139 journals the right hand end of the leadscrew 46 in the hole 133 and the pin 140 also holds the leadscrew 46 in place axially. Fig.17 shows three saddles 40, 42 and 44 slidably mounted on the spine 12. The saddle 0 is coupled to a nut 147 Fig.22 on the leadscrew 46 which extends from the interior of the spine 12 through a slot 48 to the saddle 40 and is attached thereto by a screw 141.The slot 48 extends throughout the length of the spine at the underside of the spine in all of the views shown in the drawings , as can be seen in Fig.23. As shown in Figs.17 to 22, each of the saddles 40, 42 and 44 comprises a short length of square section tube dimensioned to be a close sliding fit on the square sectioned spine 12. Each of the saddles 42 and 44 which is not coupled to the leadscrew 46 can be clamped in any desired position along the spine by means of a thumbscrew 50 Fig.21 which extends through one corner of the square section saddle in the direction of the diagonal of the square section. The saddle 40 can also have a clamping screw 50, as shown in Fig.22. Tightening of the thrumbscrew tightens the spine against two adjacent interior faces of the saddle thereby rendering the saddle completely immobile relative to the spine. Each of the three saddles has two sockets 52 and 54 which are at right angles to one another and to the adjacent faces of the spine. All of the saddles are correspondingly arranged so that the sockets 52 on all of the saddles are parallel to one another and in a common plane and the sockets 54 are likewise parallel to one another and in a second common plane. Each socket comprises a short circular section tube adapted to receive a circular spigot 56 Fig.21 or tube of any desired attachment to be described hereinafter and provided with a locking thumbscrew 53. It is to be noted that all of the sockets 52 and 54 are of identical dimensions so that all of the attachments are completely interchangeable in position. Fig.l7 shows the work station used as a lathe in which a headstock 60 forms one attachment and is mounted on the saddle 44 and a tailstock 64 forms another attachment mounted on the saddle 40 which is coupled to the leadscrew. A third attachment in the form of a tool rest 62 is mounted on the intermediate saddle 42. The headstock 60 comprises a bracket adapted to receive and support a conventional electric drill 76 and may be designed to receive drills of different manufacture. The saddles 42 and 44 being clamped in a desired position, the work station can thus be used as a wood lathe, as shown. In the use of the work station as a drill stand Fig.l8 , a drill attachment is used which comprises a column 70 of the same external diameter as the spigots 56 Fig.21 , the column thereby being receivable in one of the sockets, e.g. the socket 52 of the saddle 44, as shown in Fig.18. A conventional drill mount 72 is slidably mounted on the column 70, preferably in an adjustable position where it can be clamped by means of a thumbscrew not shown . The mount 72 includes a bracket 74 adapted to receive a conventional electric drill 76, such as is also shown in Fig.17.A handle 78 on the mount 72 serves for displacing the bracket 74 and thereby the drill 76 in a direction parallel to the column 70, this being the vertical direction in the set up shown in Fig.18. A workpiece not shown can be clamped between jaws 80 and 82 mounted in sockets 52 on the saddles 40 and 42, the drill being shown above the opening between the jaws. The jaws can be closed by operating the handle 38. A workpiece table 84 is shown as a further attachment mounted on the second socket 54 of the saddle 44 by means of the tailstock 64 as shown in Fig.l to which the column 70 is also attached. By swinging the drill through 900 about the vertical, the drill can be brought to a position above a workpiece table 84.The workpiece table 84 can be turned to any desired angle by virtue of the socket 54 being of circular section for the purpose of drilling a hole in the workpiece at any desired angle. It may also be mounted on the drill to form a face plate. Fig.l9 shows the work station set up as a mechanical saw. To this end, a saw table 86 serves as one of the attachments and preferably has two spigots therebeneath for fitting to the two saddles 42,44 which are lockable to the spine 12. A bracket 75 is mounted beneath the saw table for the purpose of securing a conventional electric drill to whose spindle a circular saw blade 88 is mounted. This circular saw blade 88 protrudes through a slot in the table 86 and a safety guard 90 is mounted on the table. Separate clamping jaws 92 are secured to a further table 94 serving as a further attachment which is mounted on the saddle 40 which is coupled to the leadscrew. The table 94 lies flush with the table 86 and can therefore help t9 support large workpieces tQ be sawn.The jaws 92 which can be secured to the table 94 as shown can also serve as a guide for a workpiece to be sawn. Further jaws 96 can be attached to the table 86 to serve as guides. Fig.20 simply shows two jaws 95 and 97 attached to respective sockets on the saddles 40 and 42. The jaws are L shaped and can be turned from the position shown in which they act as a simple vice, through 1800 to provide small platforms upon which the ends or sides of the workpiece to be clamped can rest. A further pair of jaws 95,97 could also be fitted to the sockets 54 at right angles to the jaws shown in Fig.20. It thereby becomes possible to clamp two ,workpieces simultaneously at an angle of 900 to one another, e.g. to facilitate the making of a joint between such workpieces. The spine 12 can be turned to any desired angle most appropriate to facilitate the working operation. By dismantling the frame 10, the spine can be used on its own, the jaws 95, 97 being used to clamp the spine at a desired location. The free saddle 44 not shown in Fig.20 can then be used to support a tool. With the frame dismantled, it is possible to remove the saddles from the spine and to then replace them angularly displaced relative to one another so that the sockets 52 and likewise the sockets 54 on the saddles are no longer in a common plane. As shown in Fig.l7, a wire mesh 100 can be placed on the frame and serves as a shelf for tools. It would also catch falling workpieces, swarf and the like. This wire mesh can be removed to enable a large workpiece, such as a panel, to be disposed on the braces 22 and 24. Such workpiece can be drilled by means of the drill station shown in Fig.l8 by mounting the other end of the column 70 in the corresponding socket and turning the spine through 180 so that the drill hangs downwardly below the spine. A workpiece can be held down against the braces 22, 24 by clamping a strut between a pair of jaws 95, 97 in the sockets 54 with the lower end of the strut pressing against the workpiece. Whilst reference has been made above to thumbscrews, this term is to be interpreted boardly to include any screw which is adapted to be turned by hand, possibly with the aid of a simple tool. The drawings show the thumbscrews to be fitted with tommy bars.
