# Rotation control device.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a rotation control circuit for positioning a rotating member driven by a motor comprising a power sup ply and a motor relay which is energized by the power supply. A circuit is provided for intermittently energizing the relay. The circuit may comprise a first switch means connected to the power supply and a second switch means connecting the first switch means to the motor relay. The second switch means is normally closed and a timer is connected to the first switch means which is operable in response to a closing of the first switch means to generate a relay energizing signal after a predetermined time delay. This signal is operable, through an associated relay, to open the second switch means and thereby deenergize the motor relay after the predetermined time delay. The control circuit is also operable to energize the motor relay in the continuous mode. Finally, safety interlocks are provided in the control circuit to minimize any hazards to operating personnel.
