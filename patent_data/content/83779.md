## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION HYPERURETIC AGENTSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is concerned with certain pyrazinoic acid derivatives useful as hyperuretic agents, and with pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating hypertension, eclampsia, uremia, and similar disorders in which the active ingredient employed is one of said pyrazinoic acid derivatives. The present invention is also concerned with the combination of certain pyrazinoic acid derivatives useful as hyperuretic agents and various saluretic agents and with pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treating hypertension in which the active ingredient employed is a combination of one of said pyrazinoic acid derivatives and a saluretic agent. In mammals, including man, urea is the principal end product of nitrogen metabolism. Urea is synthesized in the body through the intermediation of the ornithine urea cycle as from the more toxic ammonia and carbon dioxide. Some twenty five grams of urea are synthesized in the human body per day and excreted primarily by way of the kidneys. Urea and sodium chloride constitute the principal osmotically active constituents of the body. Whereas this osmotic role is similar for the two, urea and salt, they differ in important respects. Sodium chloride must be obtained from some exogenous source, and the distribution of sodium is essentially limited to extracellular fluid, including plasma water. Urea is synthetized by the body in large amounts, and its distribution is both intracellular and extracellular being equivalent to total body water. Potassium serves the intracellular osmotic role assumed by sodium extracellularly. When excess sodium is consumed, or retained by less than adequate renal function, iso osmotic pressure is sustained by thirst stimulated increased fluid consumption and by fluid retention which may lead to increased blood pressure and or edema. In the presence of impaired renal function sufficient to reduce urea excretion, its accumulation may be enough to cause increased intracellular as well as extracellular fluid accumulation, if iso osmotic relationships are sustained by fluid accumulation. In severe circumstance, uremia may result. It is this intracellular extracellular accumulation of fluid that is most likely to account for the symptomatology as well as the signs of uremia. At sub uremic elevations of urea and body water levels the symptomatology may well be confused with salt retention, in which case therapy based on saluresis or hyperuresis may be used interchangeably to some extent. The present state of clinical knowledge recognizes that urea is filtered with plasma water at the glomeruli of the kidney and that a portion of that filtered urea undergoes passive back diffusion in the course of urine formation by the nephron. The passive back diffusion of urea can be reduced by increasing the transit rate, i.e., increasing the urine flow. Increased transit rate can be induced 1 by expanding body fluid volume, which is self defeating from a therapeutic standpoint 2 with the aid of an osmotic diuretic, e.g., mannitol, which is impractical because of the need to administer large amounts parenterally, or 3 temporarily, by the use of potent saluretic agents at dosages sufficient to alter electrolyte balance. In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered that the mammalian kidney is capable of actively secreting and reabsorbing urea in addition to being filtered at the glomeruli and undergoing passive back diffusion. Moreover, it has been discovered that the pyrazinoic acid derivatives utilized in the present invention are capable of inhibiting the active renal tubular reabsorption of urea, predominantly whereas other pyrazinoic acid derivatives such as the fluoro analog of amiloride inhibit preponderantly active tubular secretion of urea without significantly inhibiting active reabsorption of urea. In so doing they lower urea blood levels and increase the osmotic concentration of urine as indications of their capability of influencing osmotically modulated functions of cells and cell membranes. These may thus be called osmoregulatory agents to identify their role in therapy. Their usefulness is considered to extend from the management of mild hypertension to the neurological symptomatology of malignant or severe hypertension, of eclampsia and or uremia.Combined with various saluretic agents, their usefulness is considered to extend from the management of mild hypertension and pulmonary edema to the neurological symptomatology of malignant or severe hypertension.2. Brief Description of the Prior Art Cragoe U.S. Pat. No. 3,313,813 describes 3 amino 5,6 disubstituted pyrazinoyl guanidines and their use as diuretic, natriuretic agents which selectively enhance the excretion of sodium ions without causing an increase in excretion of potassium ions. Benos et al. in V. Gen. Physiol. 68 1 43 63 1976 describe the effect of amiloride and some of its analogs on cation transport in isolated frog skin and thin lipid membranes. However, none of the above references in any way suggests the use of the particular pyrazinoic acid derivative hyperuretic agents utilized in the present invention for treating hypertension, eclampsia, uremia, and the like, since these references fail to suggest the hyperuretic activity of said pyrazinoic acid derivatives, and since said derivatives do not have sufficient saluretic and antikaluretic activity to be useful in accordance with the requirements described in said references.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION ANDPREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition for hyperuretic use comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula EMI5.1 whereinY is O or NH, 45R is OH NHCONE4R5 or N C NR R where R4 and R5 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hyrogen C1 10 alkyl, straight or branched chain aryl C14 alkyl mono or disubstituted aryl C14 alkyl where the substituents are fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, or C1 10 alkyl, straight or branched chain R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, amino, and mono or di substituted amino where the substituents are C1 10 alkyl, straight or branched chain, or C3 µ cycloalkyl provided that RÚ and Rê may not both be amino or substituted amino andR3 is hydrogen fluoro chloro bromo or iodo and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

The compounds and combinations of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug.These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Sucn materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc. containing the active ingredient are employed. For the compounds of Formula I, dosage levels of the order of 25 to 750 mg. per day are useful in the treatment of the above indicated conditions. For example, hypertension is effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.5 to 15 mg. of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day. Advantageously from about 1 to about 15 mg. per kilogram of body weight and especially from about 2 to about 10 mg. per kilogram daily dosage produces highly effective results. Dosage levels for the saluretic agent component of the combinations of the present invention will generally be in accordance with established dosages for these agents as independent therapeutics. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 25 to 750 mg. of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 25 to about 500 mg. of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. In accordance with the present invention there is further provided a method of treating hypertension comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula EMI13.1 wherein Y, R, R1 R2, and R3 have the same meaning as above. In accordance with the present invention there is still further provided a method of treating a hyperuremic condition comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amout of a compound of the formula EMI14.1 wherein Y, R, R1, R2, and R3 have the same meaning as above. In accordance with tne present invention there is further provided a method of treating hypertension comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of the combination of a a compound of the formulaEMI14.2 wherein Y, R, R1, R2 and R3 have the same meaning as above and b a saluretic agent selected from the group consisting essentially of ethacrynic acid furosemide bumetanide muzolimine benzothiadiazines including chlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide chlorothalidone quinethazone metholazone indacrinone acetazolamide ethoxyzolamide and methazolamide. In accordance with the present invention there is still further provided a method of treating edema comprising administering to a host in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of the combination of a a compound of the formulaEMI15.1 wherein Y, R, R1, R2 and R3 have the same meaning as above and b a saluretic agent selected from the group consisting essentially of ethacrynic acid furosemide bumetanide muzolimine benzothiadiazines including chlorothiazide and nydrochlorothiazide chlorothalidone quinethazone metholazone indacrinone acetazolamide ethoxyzolamide and methazolamide. The compounds of Formula I inhibit urea net reabsorption in a dose related manner that includes increased excretion of sodium, chloride and potassium. Their effect is independent of urine flow, and under conditions where passive back diffusion is minimized they increase urea clearance to approximate glomerular filtration rate. There is resident in pyrazinoic acid derivatives a variable capability to inhibit secretion of urea into the lumen of the renal tubule. This is minimal in the pyrazinoylguanidine of the present invention, which does not manifest that effect in Dalmatians, whereas the fluoro analog of amiloride almost completely inhibits urea secretion and fluid excretion even when back diffusion is minimized. In stop flow experiments, inhibition of active reabsorption and secretion can be demonstrated. The compounds of Formula I utilized in the present invention are active on oral as well as parenteral administration. 3 Aminopyrazinoylguanidine is most effective promptly, whereas pyrazinoylguanidine effect and blood level requires perhaps an added hour for maximal effect. As already indicated, the compounds ofFormula I utilized in the present invention may properly be called osmoregulatory agents.Osmoregulation, in turn, involves several interrelated factors. Salts, as the sum of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate ions, supplies some 93 of the 300 milliOsmols L of extra cellular water in humans. Urea supplies about 1.3 of that osmotic force, normally.Of the other constituents, only glucose at 1.8 is a factor in osmoregulation. Thus, osmoregulation of water volume to sustain isotonicity is by thirst and by the action of the antidiuretic hormone on the most distal portion of the nephron to modulate water reabsorption.Whereas there is an appetite for salt regulation, the kidney seems designed to maximize sodium conservation. The search for a salt regulating hormone continues, but the only known active sodium reabsorptive mechanisms in the kidney involve the availability of hydrogen ions and or the aldosteronemodulated availability of potassium for exchange with sodium across the nephron. Sodium rarely becomes a means for increasing water excretion, unless its reabsorption is decreased by the action of natriuretic or saluretic diuretic agents. One other homeostatic mechanism, the so called sodium pump, or sodium potassiummagnesium dependent ATP ase mechanism common to cell membranes, serves to relegate the osmoregulatory effect of sodium on fluid volume primarily to extracellular space, or about 25 of total cellular and extra cellular volume. Thus, exquisitely small increases in sodium retention are capable of expanding extra cellular volume, thus increasing blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate, without substantial involvement of cell volume. On the other hand, the osmoregulation of thirst by the cells of the neurohypophysis is not so sensitive to urea concentration. As ADH influences water reabsorptiqn, so does it alter urea back diffusion by the kidney. Conversely, in the course of the human kidney normally excreting some 25 grams of urea per day, that substance serves as the principal osmoregulator of water excretion. The plasma concentration of urea can be influenced by both protein intake and by renal tubular reabsorption of a portion of the amount filtered by the glomeruli. Thus, a high protein diet normally increases both urea and water excretion.Low protein intake or reduced glomerular filtration rate decreases urea and fluid output. As an approximation, if glomerular filtration rate is reduced to half normal, plasma water concentration of urea will double on a given protein intake. The consequence is to expand intracellular volume as well as extracellular by a ratio of 45 25 or 1.8, assuming a constant osmotic pressure relationship exists between the two spaces. The reason for this important difference between the two spaces is that while sodium is essentially limited to extra cellular space, urea is distributed more or less uniformly throughout body water. Thus, the patient whose urea plasma concentration is twice normal and whose extracellular volume is expanded carries a greater total expanded volume than if the urea level was normal.What may be considerably more important than the increased total volume is how that increased intra cellular fluid is distributed within the cells, their membranes, the compartmentalization of their structure. Urea, like salt, is not acutely toxic to the normal subject, if administered with sufficient water to sustain isotonicity. However, the adjustments to marked hyperuremia might be anticipated to include severe imbalance of body fluids, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, edema to which the retention of substances resembling the toxicity of guanidine bases may be thought to contribute to the total but variable clinical picture of uremia. In view of the foregoing relationship between urea and salt, it should follow that saluretic diuretic therapy would be an adequate control of fluid retention in the absence of hyperuremia. When elevated urea plasma concentration co exists with fluid retention, or hypertension that responds to thiazide administration, then it would seem rational to induce increased urea excretion to reduce its blood level. Increased urea blood level in cardiovascular renal disease is more common than appreciated.Whereas increased urine flow increases urea excretion, diuretics and adrenergic blocking agents are more likely to increase urea blood levels. In view of this proposed reciprocal relationship of salt and urea retention, saluretic diuretic treatment of hypertension represents only half of a rational therapeutic measure combined saluretic hyperuremic therapy. In accordance with the present invention, therefore, use of the pyrazinoic acid derivatives described herein makes possible a greater direct control of electrolyte and water balance, i.e., homeostasis, and expands the utility of present therapy by providing direct regulation of tissue fluid as well as extracellular fluid. The present invention provides a new and expanded way of looking at the management of electrolyte and water balance in terms of osmoregulation. Accordingly, the present invention provides for sustained therapy in the treatment of hypertension postoperative treatment for the relief of tissue accumulation of fluids without risk of disturbed acid base balance management of acute or chronic hyperuremia that may or may not require occasional dialysis and treatment of pulmonary edema. The following example will serve to illustrate the hyperuretic activity of the pyrazinoic acid derivatives utilized in the present invention, with and without a saluretic agent, hydrochlorothiazide, and in contrast to other pyrazinoic acid compounds exemplified by the fluoro analog of amiloride. EXAMPLE 1 Food and water were withheld from a femaleDalmatian Coach Hound overnight. It was given 4 g of creatinine subcutaneously 20 min. before beginning the first of two successive duplicate 20 min. control clearance periods. Immediately thereafter, a 1.0 ml min venoclysis of 260 mOsm L mannitol PO4 buffer containing the test compound sufficient to sustain an infusion rate of 3.0 mg kg h plus a single 2.0 mg kg priming i.v. dose was begun and continued throughout the experiment. Ten minutes later, an additional 1.0 g of creatinine vas injected subcutaneously. Creatinine clearance was employed for the measurement of glomerular filtration rate. Twenty minutes after beginning the venoclysis, the first of a succession of six 20 minute clearances was carried out over the next two hours. Plasma and urine specimens were analyzed for urea, sometimes uric acid, sodium, chloride, potassium, creatinine, and including urine pH and rate of flow. Pyrazinoylguanidine inhibited the active reabsorption of urea and lowered urea plasma concentration in the Dalmatian, Table I. It lowered the urea plasma concentration and increased the excretion of urea, sodium and potassium, but the effect on chloride excretion was variable. Uric acid excretion was not affected. When 3 aminopyrazinoylguanidine was administered to a Dalmatian according to the same protocol as for pyrazinoylguanidine, its effect on urea clearance ratio and blood level Table II may have been slightly less than for pyrazinoylguanidine Table I . The natriuretic effects of the two compounds were similar, but pyrazinoylguanidine had a greater kaliuretic effect that on chloride being more variable among the several dogs and inversely related to urinary pH. As represented in Table III, the fluoro analog of amiloride profoundly depressed the tubular secretion of urea in the Dalmatian. The effect was immediate and progressed to the point that the concentration of urea in urine was indeterminably low. Urea plasma concentration increased substantially as its excretion was depressed.Although inhibition of active urea secretion into the lumen seemed a likely interpretation of these results, the fluoro analog of amiloride experiment in the Dalmatian was repeated in the presence of sufficient mannitol venoclysis 10 solution at 5 ml min to sustain a urine flow approximately 2.0 ml min. This urine flow is sufficient to minimize urea back diffusion. When urine flow was sustained at approximately 2.0 ml min so as to minimize back diffusion,the fluoro analog of amiloride decreased urea clearance to less than half the control values,Table IV, and urea plasma concentration increased. Although glomerular filtration rate remained steady, uric acid clearance was reduced by the compound to less than half the control values, and its plasma concentration increased slightly. Sodium and chloride excretion increased more than potassium. The data described above is shown in TablesI IV below. TABLE I.

EXAMPLE 2 In Tables V and VI are presented the effect of first pyrazinoylguanidine then both pyrazinoylguanidine and hydrochlorothiazide Table V and, alternatively, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide then hydrochlorothiazide and pyrazinoylguanidine on excretion of urea and the inorganic electrolytes Table VI in the dog. Prior to the duplicate control 20 minute clearances, creatinine was injected subcutaneously and an isotonic mannitol PO4 buffer venoclysis was begun and continued throughout the experiment at 1 ml min. Immediately after the second control clearance either pyrazinoylguanidine was added to the venoclysis at 3 mg kg h plus 2 mg kg prime I.V. or hydrochlorothiazide was added at a rate of 1.5 mg kg h plus 1 mg kg prime. In either instance, after 30 minutes a succession of three 20 minute clearances were conducted. Immediately thereafter, the mannitol infusion was changed to one containing both pyrazinoylguanidine and hydrochlorothiazide at the dosages specified for the first drug phase. Thirty minutes later, three more 20 minute clearances were performed. Blood and urine were subjected to the customary analyses. If the first drug phase of Tables V and VI are compared, the typical effects of the two compounds are evident. Pyrazinoylguanidine increased urea excretion and reduced its plasma concentration disproportionate to the increased urine flow. It increased sodium, potassium and chloride excretion, but the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on sodium, potassium, chloride and osmolar excretion was approximately twice that of pyrazinoylguanidine. Any marginal effect of hydrochlorothiazide on the urea parameters was due to the increase in urine flow attributable to the greater saluresis. When the two compounds were combined in the second drug phase, the sum of their effects were evident in both Tables V and VI. The effect on urea was increased somewhat by the greater diuresis plus the pyrazinoylguanidine, and the compounds combined to increase sodium, chloride, potassium and osmolar output and urine flow. The data discussed above is set out inTables V and VI below TABLE VI. Effect of hydrochlorothiazide alone then coadministered with pyrazinoylguanidine on the excretion of urea, Na, Cl, K by the dog.
