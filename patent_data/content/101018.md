# Impact printer head capable of printing a dot at a distance narrower than a thickness of a printer unit.

## Abstract
In an impact printer head intermittently movable along a printing line and comprising a plurality of printer units 25 each of which has a thickness and a printing wire 30 having a printing end operable between rest and actuated positions along a line of displacement R , a support member 45 supports the printing wires so that a distance between two adjacent ones of the printing ends becomes smaller than each thickness at the actuated positions. To this end, the printer units are radially disposed by the supporting member to make the lines of displacement form an acute angle for two adjacent printer units and to position the printing ends in a predetermined configuration at the actuated positions. The predetermined configuration may be a single straight line perpendicular or oblique to the printing line. Alternatively, the configuration may be a pair of straight lines orthogonal or inclined to the printing line. The printing ends may be parallel to one another when supported by the support member along a straight line inclined to the printing line.
