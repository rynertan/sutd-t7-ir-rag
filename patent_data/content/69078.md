# Device to spread the dough for pizza.

## Abstract
Device to spread in thin circular rounds 211 the lumps of dough 11 used in the preparation of pizzas, in thin circular rounds 211 by rolling the dough in at least two directions which advantageously are substantially at right angle to each other, in such a way that during the processing the dough is rolled into progressively smaller thickness, which comprises a carrying structure 12 having a sloping working surface a first pair 20 of rollers to roll the dough which are anchored by by supports 24 to said sloping surface of the carrying structure 12 , a second pair 30 of rollers to roll the dough which are positioned substantially at an angle to said first pair 20 and are anchored by supports 34 to said sloping surface or the carrying structure 12 , whereby the gap between the rollers 31 32 of said second pair is the same as the final thickness of the thin round 211 , and whereby oscillating means 50 are envisaged for temporarily and movably supporting and guiding the thin round 111 being formed.
