# Process for filling hard capsules with pharmaceutical products containing phospholipids and being highly viscous at room temperature.

## Abstract
The present invention is related to a process for filling pharmaceutical products which contain 10 to 98 by weight of a phospholipide and which are highly viscous at room temperature, into hard capsules by admixing to such pro ducts a solvent or mixture of solvents in particular amounts, said solvent or solvent mixture having particular evapora tion properties, and ejecting the resulting product from a usual filler nozzle under particular conditions, and closing the filled capsule with its cap.
