# Crimp seal pleated filter assembly.

## Abstract
A crimp seal pleated filter assembly having a base 20 , a frame 40 and a filter media 60 , including a plurality of pleats 66 . When assembled, the pleats 66 of the filter media 60 are uniformly aligned within the assembly 10 and are secured therein by crimp sealing the filter media ends 62 between interlocking projections 30 50 on the sides 23 of the base 20 and side walls 43 of the frame. Outboard end flaps 68 of the filter are crimp sealed and encapsulated between side blades 26 of the frame 20 and the front wall 42 and back wall 4 t of the frame, minimizing flaking or chafing of fibers from the filter 60 .
