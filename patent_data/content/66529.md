# Apparatus and method for slowing down and preventing edge damage on moving sheets.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the shingling of cut sheets 11, 12, 13, 14 of paper as they pass between conveyance on a high speed tape conveyor 10 and a low speed tape conveyor 16 is provided by means comprising a two stage slowdown arrangement. At the first stage, a slowdown mechanism, comprising two rolls 33,36 arranged respectively above and below each sheet passing through a drop off area T from the high speed conveyor to the low speed conveyor, serves to engage the tail portion of the sheet in a nip such that the sheet is slowed down to a speed approximately 30 to 40 of the speed of the high speed conveyor. In this manner, the lead edge of a next succeeding sheet overlaps with the trailing edge of the nipped sheet in a drop off area T from the high speed tape conveyor 10 . Downstream of the slowdown rolls is a stop roll 61 which serves to reduce the speed of the immediately preceding sheet to the speed of the low speed tape conveyor, which is still slower than the speed of the slowdown rolls 33,36 , such that the sheet passing through the nip of the slow down rolls further overlaps with the immediately preceding sheet. The possibility of lead edge damage to the sheets engaging with a stop roll for shingling is effectively eliminated.
