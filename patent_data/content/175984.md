# Semiconductor device comprising MOS transistors.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device which comprises an N channel MOS transistor 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 deposited on a P conductivity substrate 11 , a P channel MOS transistor 14, 16, 17, 18, 19 mounted on said N channel MOS transistor, and a high melting metal layer 41 interposed between the drain regions 12 , 16 of said first and second MOS transistors in a direction perpendicular to the surface of said semiconductor device to thereby effect ohmic contact be tween said drain regions 12 , 16 .
