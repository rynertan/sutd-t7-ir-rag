# Improved copper base alloy containing manganese and iron.

## Abstract
A copper base alloy having improved stress relaxation resistance. The alloy consists essentially of about 15.0 to 31 zinc about 1.0 to 5.0 aluminum about 0.1 to less than 1 iron about 1.1 to 8 manganese and the balance essentially copper. The alloy is particularly useful for spring applications.
