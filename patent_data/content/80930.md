# Electrical connector assembly.

## Abstract
An electrical connector assembly 100 includes a cou pling ring 50 for connecting together two connector housings 10, 20 and self contrained means for resisting rotation of the coupling ring relative to the connector housing 20 to which it is rotatably mounted. The resisting means includes coupling ring 50 and connector housing 20 respectively, frusto conical surfaces 72, 82 with balls 74 and sockets 84 , in faced relation, the balls being adapted to be received in and rotated to succeeding sockets. The compressible plastic is such that as the housing are drawn into tight engagement the balls on the coupling ring engage the plastic surface on the other connector housing 10 , causing the balls and surfaces to elastically compress. The tapered shoulders enhance engagement therebetween to increase the frictional forces resisting the vibration and radially locates the coupling ring with respect to the connector components to minimize hammering in shock prone environments resulting from radial clearances there between.
