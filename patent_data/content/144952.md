# Method for treating waste compositions containing copper and a copper complexing agent.

## Abstract
Process for treating liquid waste compositions which contain copper ions and a complexing agent for the copper which includes reducing the concentration of copper ions in the waste composition to less than about 8 ppm and contacting the composition with H₂O₂ and then contacting the waste composition with an ozone containing gas and irradiating with ultraviolet light.
