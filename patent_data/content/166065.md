## Description
VOLTAGE SENSOR UTILIZING A SURFACE WAVE ELECTROACOUSTIC STRUCTURESENSIBLE TO THE ELECTRIC FIELDThe present invention relates to a voltage sensor device including detector means, the physical characteristics of which are sensitive to possible electric fields. More particularly, the present invention refers to a voltage sensor device comprising a plate of piezoelectric material submitted to the action of the p.d. to be measured and having on one of its faces a surface wave electroacoustic means, by which a modification of the physical characteristics of the piezoelectric plate, due to the application of an unknown potential difference, causes a variation of the propagation rate of the acoustic surface waves. Such variation of the propagation rate is then detected and measured for obtaining the value of the unknown p.d.Before disclosing the structure of the device according to the invention, it would be advisable to make a short account inherent to the surface acoustic waves.By the term surface acoustic waves SAW there are generally included all the mechanical waves which propagate on the free surface of a solid body. A common characteristic of the surface waves is that almost all the acoustic enerssSconcentrated within a surface layer having a thickness corresponding to about the length of the acoustic wave in useful propagation.Moreover, the profile of the acoustic field does not change during the propagation owing to the diffraction phenomena, but remain un varied because its behaviour is determined only by the elastic conditions at boundary. . The family of these waves is extremely wide, as it results from several parameters which determine them curvature of the substrate surface, elastic characteristics of the propagation medium, homogeneity degree of the medium, interactive with the electric field and electric charges, conformation of the acoustic field flate wave, cylindric or spheric wave or more complex waves .A wave type, to be considered as fundamental and more interesting from the point of view of its applications, is the Rayleigh wave, the sole elastic wave type which may propagate on the free and flate surface of an isotrope solid or of a crystal generalizedRayleigh waves with a propagation rate somewhat lower than that of the transverse volume waves in the same material.The motion of the particles of the material, in which the propagation takes place, is submitted to a dependance of elliptic kind. In the isotrope materials the greater axis of the ellipse is orthogonal to the propagation plane, whereas the smaller axis is parallel to the propagation direction.In the crystals, excepted some directions of a higher symmetry degree, the motion of the particles is always of elliptic kind and there are three displacement components. Towards the inside of the material the components of the vibration amplitude quickly decrease and the energy of the wave becomes negligeable at a depth higher than the wave length. Therefore, the Rayleigh wave may be considered as a wave of bidimensional type.For several years, scismotogists only have investigated the surface waves. Recently, the introduction of the interdigital transductors consisting of a periodic structure of metal electrodes carried out directly on the propagation surface of piezoelectric material by using photolithographic techniques developed for performing electronic microcircuits has allowed the solution of problems connected with both the generation and detection of the high frequency surface waves. The solution of said problems has consequently allowed to carry out electroacoustic devices adapted to execute complex processings of electric signals throughout the frequency ranges up to GHz. Any alteration of the propagation surface of the surface waves modifies the acoustic properties of the substrate causing thus the variation of both the propagation rate and attenuation.Specifically, if a thin film is used, it can change the electric constants of the substrate, the real mass of the oscillating particles and, for the piezoelectric means, the electric conditions at the boundary.In the field of the electronics there are generally used the following piezoelectric materials for the substrates of surface acoustic wave devices A. LiNbO3 lithium niobate with the following crystallographic orientations 1 cut y proagation 2 2 cut y propagation x 3 rotation of 41.50 with respect to y propagation xB. LiTaO3 lithium tantalate with the following crystallographic orientations 1 cut y propagation 2 2 cut x propagation y 3 cut 2 propagation yC. B12Ge020 bismuth germanate cut 001 propagation 110 D Si02 quartz cut y propagation x cut x propagation y cut ST propagation x temperature coefficient null at ambient temperature .The main differences among the above identified materials consist in a different propagation rate of the surface acoustic wave b different temperature coefficient c different coefficient of electromechanic coupling.Since some time the technology of the surface acoustic wave devices prefers to use non piezoelectric substrates, on which there is placed an epitaxial piezoelectric film usually ZnOz ine oxide or AlN aluminium nitride .Further details about the surface acoustic waves and their applications, may be found in the following references 1 Rayleigh Lord On waves propagated along the place surface of an elastic solid Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, vol.17 1885 p. 4 2 Schoch A.

Surface waves in acoustics Physicals Acoustics,Ed.Mason W.P. and Thurston R.N., vol. 10 1973 , p. 1.As herebefore mentioned, the physical principle of the surface acoustic waves may be utilized for carrying out a voltage sensor by means of a structure sensitive, in physical terms, to the application of an unknown p.d. which influences the substrate portion, in which the surface acoustic waves propagate, causing the modification of the elastic characteristics.Further details and advantages will result from the following disclosure of some preferred embodiments of the present invention, shown in the enclosed drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a portion of the structure of a typical surface acoustic wave device Fig. 2 shows a schematical view of an embodiment of the voltage sensor, in which an electroacoustic surface acoustic wave structure according to the present invention is used Fig. 3 shows a first embodiment of the circuit detecting the variations of the physic constants of the voltage sensor in dependance on the voltage to be detected Figs. 4a, b,c and d show different embodiments and connections of the sensor Figs. Sa,b,and c show different embodiments and connections of the voltage sensor, with selfoscillating conformations Fig. 6 shows an embodiment in which a non piezoelectric substrate is used, with a superposed thin piezoelectric film.Referring now to Fig. 1, a typical surface acoustic wave base device comprises a substrate 10 of piezoelectric material having the above said orientation for allowing the propagation of the surface acoustic waves. If such material is of monocrystal type it may be obtained by growth from a melting bath system CZ or, if it consists of a thin film on an inert substrate, it may be obtained by several known techniques, such as thermic evaporation,conventional sputtering or radiofrequency reactive sputtering or also in direct current, coating from vapour state or liquid epitaxis. On the exposed face of the active material there are carried out, by engraving or lithographic techniques, periodical recurring structures for emitting and receiving the surface acoustic waves.A typical structure of this kind is shown by the reference numeral 11 and comprises a first and a second comb shaped structure 12, 13, having an exact interspace of the teeth, which have a length W corresponding to the width of the surface wave beam.In Fig. 1 only one of such structures is shown. It should be understood that on the other end portion of the substrate . 10 it is provided a corresponding structure for emitting and receiving the surface acoustic waves. The propagation rate and the attenuation constant of such waves depend, besides the mechanical finish of the surface, upon the physical characteristics of the substrate, so that the application of an electric field, which modifies the elastic constants of the piezoelectric plate, causes a variation of the propagation rate of the surface acoustic waves, variation which may be detected and measured.With reference to Fig. 2, it may be seen that the base element of the surface acoustic wave voltage sensor comprises a surface wave delay line, carried out on a piezoelectric substrate 20. On the opposite faces of said substrate there are applied by deposition, two metal films 23 and 24 for applying an electric field, whereas two interdigital transductors 21, 22 are formed on the piezoelectric substrate 20 by a thin metal film by conventional photographic techniques. A transductor emits the surface waves which are received after a time L V by the second transductor L distance between the centers of the two transductors, V the propagation rate of the surface waves in the deposited piezoelectric metal film 23 .When a potential difference p.d. is applied to the two rheophores 25, 26, an electric field is generated within the substrate which owing to the piezoelectric effect causes a variation of the propagation rate of the surface waves. From the constructive point of view it is more advisable to connect the electorde 23 to the potential which is the nearest to that of the transductors 21 and 22, so as to avoid the discharges between said transductors and the electrode 23.The variations of the propagation rate caused by the unknown p.d.may be detected and measured as phase difference with respect to the input of the signal received at the output of the delay line.Fig. 3 shows a first embodiment and connection type of the surface acoustic wave voltage sensor. The sensitive element of the voltage sensor consists of a surface wave delay line carried out on the substrate 40, on the faces of which, likely as in the structure shown in Fig. 2, there are applied two field contact metal films 41, 41a, the unknown p.d. being applied to the rheophores 25, 26 thereof, an interdigital transmission structure 42 and an interdigital reception structure 43.An input signal is applied to terminals 44 and through an adaptation network 45 it reaches the transmission structure 42. The input signal reaches also a first input 46 of a phase detector, well known in the art.The signal emitted by the transmitting structure 42 passes through the zone of the sensitive film subjected to the electric field generated by the applied unknown p.d. and is received by the receiving structure 43 with a delay depending on the variation of the elastic characteristics of the applied electric field.The output signal from the receiving structure 43 reaches, through an adaptor network 47, another input 49 of a phase detector 49.It is clear, that in case of modification of the elastic characteristics of the piezoelectric substrate, there will occur variations of the propagation characteristics of the surface wave and consequently the output of a useful signal from the phase detector 49.In Fig. 4a it is shown a structure substantially similar to that ofFig. 3, in which the principle of the differential modification between two different zones of the piezoelectric substrate is used. In this figure the parts corresponding to those of Fig. 3 are indicated with the same reference numerals but provided with apex.Obviously, in the structure of Fig. 4a, only one zone of the dielectric substrate will be submitted to the action of the electric field due to the unknown p.d. to be detected, whereas the second zone serves as a reference zone. It should be noted that the electrode 41 is principally not indispensable, however, it allows to render perfectly simmetrical the two channels in absence of an applied p.d. .For one skilled in the art it will be clear that a structure of this kind has several advantages with respect to the structure of the absolute type as shown in Fig. 3, since the detection efficiency is not altered by agi 4 d ift phenomena of the piloting signals. Moreover, by such a structure there are compensated the influences of the variations of temperature and outer pressure on the sensor.The differential structure shown in Fig. 4b allows also to obtain a stabflization with respect to the variation of the ambient conditions pressure, temperature and, moreover, to double the sensitivity value of the sensor. This is attained by providing two delay lines on the two faces opposite with respect to the crystalographic orientation of the substrate. In this manner, an applied p.d. causes an increase of the propagation rate on one line and a decrease on the other one. Moreover, the symmetry of the sensor response to the changes of the voltage polarity is improved.In the figure, the arrows shown on the piezoelectric substrates indicate the crystallographic orientations. The two films of the upper field are earth connected, the Rf gerator is connected to two adaptation networks whereas the other two adaptation networks are connected to the phase detector.For measuring potential differences, balanced with respect to earth it may be used the structure shown in Fig. 4c, which may be carried out by two separate substrates or a single substrate, as shown in Fig. 4d.The structure of Fig. 4c, as demonstrated by the orientation arrows and obviously the structure of Fig. 4d differ from that of Fig. 4b by that the two delay lines are carried out on faces having the same sign with respect to the crystdallographic orientation of the substrate. Referring now to Figs. 3, 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d it may be seen that the voltage sensor may measure also the alternate potential differences.In this case the output voltage of the balanced modulator is alternate its amplitude is proportional to the amplitude of the unknown p.d., whereas its frequency coincides with the frequency of the p.d. to be measured.As to the limitations relating to the value of the frequency of the p.d.to be measured, this frequency should be sufficiently lower than the inverse of the time of passage of the surface wave between the two transductors forming the none. Bearing in mind the above said and considering the passage times in the range of one microsecond, the maximal frequency of the voltage to be measured is of about 500 kHz. Detection by oscillator Bearing in mind that the structure as above disclosed has a variation of the passage time of the signal depending on the variation of the pro pagation rate caused by the p.d., it will be easy to apply the herebefore disclosed conceipts to the autooscillating devices.Structures of this kind are shown in Figs. 5a and 5b. Fig. 5a shows a structure having a substrate 50 with an upper electrode 51 connected to receiving and transmitting interdigital structures 52 respectively 53, coupled to adaptation networks 54, 55. On the opposite face a lower electrode 50a is shown in dashed line, which is connected to the p.d. to be measured. The terminals of the four poles outside of adaptation networks 54, 55 are connected to an amplifier 56 having a sufficient gain, so that the entire assembly mayautooscillate. The oscillation frequency depends on the entire phase rotation which, in turn, depends upon the variations of the propagation rate caused by the applied p.d..The structure shown in Fig. 5a is particularly adapted for measuring alternate p.d.. The detection may be performed by measuring the modulation index of the frequency of the output signal. In fact, on the output it results a frequency modulated signal having the instantaneous value of the applied p.d.. Since the frequency variations should be measured, the device is sufficiently insensitive to the phenomena of aging and or drifting of the frequency.On the contrary, in case of measuring a direct p.d., the absence of the reference frequency frequency of applied null tension renders not tolerable the uncertainty of measure. In this case a differential structure is shown in Fig. 5b. It comprises two identical oscillators, carried out on the faces opposite to the crystallographic orientation of the substrate. In absence of an applied p.d., the two oscillation frequencies are equal, whereas in presence of a p.d. one of the two frequencies increases, whereas the other one decreases.The unknown p.d. may be measured by measuring the difference of the two frequencies beat .The differential structure allows to attain, likely as that shown inFigs. 4b, 4c and 4d, a stabilization towards the variation of the pressure and temperature and a better symmetry of the response to the changes of polarity of the applied voltage. For measuring a balanced p.d.with respect to earth it may be used the structure as shown in Fig. 5c, wherein two oscillators may be carried out on two separated substrates or on a single substrate, owing to that the delay lines are carried out on faces having the same sign with respect to the crystallographic orientation.The detecting method by means of an oscillator is particularly interesting not only owing to its simplicity, but also owing to the possibility of directly performing the measure at a distance by irradiating the output signal. For this purpose the frequency of the oscillator may be suitably selected in accordance to the transmission requirements and taking int consideration the bands available for these services.As already herebefore said, the signal in case of the sensor for the alternate voltage consists of a carrier of frequency equal to the frequency of the oscillator, frequency modulated by effect of the measured voltage. The frequency of the modulator coincides with the frequency of the measured voltage, whereas the modulation index is proportional to the amplitude of the voltage itself. The modulation frequency and thesmodulation index may be measured by a suitably adjusted receiver.In case of a sensor for measuring direct voltages, the output signal is a beat of the output signals of the two oscillators and may be considered as a signal having a frequency carrier corresponding to the mean value of the two frequencies, modulated in its amplitude by a signal having a frequency corresponding to the difference of the two frequencies.The measure of the voltage may be, in this case, obtained by detecting the output signal and measuring the frequency of the modulated signal.A structure having a thin piezoelectril filmThe technology of the surface acoustic waves provides an always increasing use of structures carried out on non piezoelectric substrates and employing thin piezoelectric films of suitable materials the most common areZnO, AiN, inS . The proposed device may employ this type of technology and assumes the base configuration shown in Fig. 6.In this case, since the thickness of the piezoelectric film is very thin the thickness of the film ranges usually from 1 20 to 1 2 of the acoustic length of the acoustic wave in the medium , At the same p.d. the electric field is much more intense and the structure is suitable to be used for measuring lowest potential differences. In the figure the non piezoelectric substrate is indicated with the reference numeral 100, the transmitting and receiving transductors are indicated respectively by the reference numerals 101 and 102 the piezoelectric film is indicated by 103, the two electrodes or field films by 104 and 105 and the two rheophores by 106 and 107.The present invention has been disclosed with reference to its embodiments as presently preferred, but it is understood that several changes and modifications may be made by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope thereof.
