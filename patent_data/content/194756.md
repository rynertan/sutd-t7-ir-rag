## Description
This invention is concerned with improvements in and relating to polyamide resins. More particularly, the invention is concerned with polyamide resins containing free non amidified amino groups and which are suitable for use as curing agents for polyepoxy compounds so called epoxy resins . The use of polyamide resins containing free amino groups as curing agents for polyepoxy compounds is well established. Thus such polyamides derived from the polycondensation of polymeric fatty acids and aliphatic polyamines are disclosed in United States Patent No. 2430940 and compositions comprising polyepoxy compounds together with such polyamides are disclosed in United States Patent No. 2705223 and British Patent Specification No. 726570. Polyamide curing agents derived from polymeric fatty acids and aliphatic polyamines are commercially available under the trade name Versamid , being manufactured in the United Kingdom by Cray Valley Products Limited and in the United States of America by Henkel Corporation of America formerly General Mills . Polyamide curing agents react with polyepoxy compounds to form cured systems by reaction of free amino groups of the polyamide with epoxy groups of the polyepoxy compound, leading to gradual cross linking and insolubilisation of the system. At ambient temperature, reaction takes place over a period of time depending on the nature of the polyamide curing agent and the polyepoxide compound and the ratio of polyamide to polyepoxy compound. The application of heat accelerates the reaction. Polyepoxide compound polyamide curing agent systems are widely used in the surface coatings art. The outstanding toughness, chemical resistance and corrosion resistance of coatings based on such systems coupled with their excellent adhesion to a variety of substrates make them ideal for heavy duty maintenance coatings. However, when used in combination with some types of epoxy resins, preferably available polyamides are less than satisfactory. Thus, drying times may be extremely long and surface defects such as residual tackiness, blooming, cissing or rivelling may be apparent, especially under adverse conditions such as low temperature and or high humidity. In order to overcome such problems it has been proposed to pre age the polyamide epoxy resin mix before use or to use a polyamide epoxy resin adduct in place of the polyamide curing agent as disclosed, for example, in British Patent No. 988 484. It has now been found, in accordance with the present invention, that certain polyamides derived from certain aromatic polybasic carboxylic acids and polymeric fatty acids are useful curing agents for polyepoxy compounds and possess, inter alia, the advantages that they can give systems which have shorter drying times than the polyamide curing agents discussed above, and give products free from surface defects as discussed above. According to the invention, therefore, there is provided a polyamide containing free amino groups and suitable for use as a curing agent for polyepoxy compounds which polyamide is derived from Aromatic dicarboxylic acids for use in accordance with the invention are those containing two carboxylic acid groups and at least one benzene ring, each carboxylic acid group being directly linked to a benzene ring. Where the acid contains two benzene rings these may be directly linked to each other or via the intermediary of a short length linking group such as an oxygen atom or methylene group. Particular examples of aromatic dicarboxylic acids which may be used include isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, diphenic acid diphenyl 2,2 dicarboxylic acid , and diphenyl ether 4,4 dicarboxylic acid. In addition to the polymeric fatty acid and aromatic dicarboxylic acids, the acid component may contain minor amounts of monocarboxylic acids to control the molecular weight of the polyamide. Examples of such mono functional acids are monocarboxylic aliphatic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid and long chain fatty acids and aromatic monocarboxylic acids such as benzoic acid and butyl benzoic acid. The acid component may also contain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids such as adipic acid, pimelic acid, azelaic acid, sebacid acid, dodecane dioic acid and West Vacco di acid a C₂₁ dicarboxylic acid prepared by the addition of ascrylic acid to conjugated linoleic acid . In addition, the acid component may contain, minor amounts of anhydrides such as maleinised fatty acids, phthalic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, pyromellitic di anhydride and do decenyl succinic anhydride. In any event, however, the acid component should contain at least 10 mole of polymeric fatty acid, preferably at least 30 mole thereof. Preferred aliphatic polyamines for use in the invention are those of the formula The amine compound may also contain, in order to control molecular weight, minor amounts of monoamines such as fatty amines, propylamine and butylamine. The polyamides of the invention are produced by polycondensation of an appropriate polybasic acid component with an appropriate polyamine component. The polycondensation is carried out under conditions conventional for the production of polyamides, for example at temperatures of from 200 to 280 C, preferably from 230 to 250 C, and under conditions such that water evolved during the course of the polycondensation may be removed from the reaction mixture. In this connection it may be noted that in some cases the polybasic acid component may comprise, at least in part, lower alkyl esters of the acids from which the polyamide is derived. In this case polycondensation should, of course, be carried out under conditions such that the lower alcohol formed during the course of the condensation is removed from the reaction medium. As will be appreciated, in principle a polyamide derived from an ester of a polycarboxylic acid is the same as one derived from the acid per se. The polycondensation reaction may be carried out by charging all the ingredients to a suitable reactor or may be carried out by adding the reactants in stages to the reactor. The polycondensation will generally be carried out using an excess of amino groups over carboxylic acid groups and the resulting polyamide, the polyamide of the invention, suitably has an amine value of from 100 400 mgKOH g, preferably from 150 350 mgKOH g. Preferably the acid value of the polyamide is from 0 20 mgKOH g. The polyamides of the invention range from balsam like materials to hard resinous materials having melting points in the range of 60 150 C depending on the amount of aromatic acid employed and the nature and amount of amine employed. In general, the lower melting point products are soluble in solvents such as xylol whilst the higher melting point products display solubility in aliphatic alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, or mixtures thereof with xylol. Dissolution of the polyamide in the solvent may be accomplished by either cold churning or by refluxing the resin solvent mixture. As noted above, the polyamides of the invention are suitable for use as curing agents for polyepoxy compounds. Thus, a further embodiment of the invention provides a process for the production of a cured resinous product which comprises reacting a polyamide in accordance with the invention with a polyepoxy compound. Further, the invention provides curable compositions comprising polyamide of the invention together with a polyepoxide compound. In this latter connection it will, of course, be understood that such compositions will tend to react and will hence be marketed in the form of two part packs, one part containing the curing agent polyamide resin and the other containing the polyepoxide compound. The polyamides of the invention may be used to cure a wide variety of polyepoxy compounds. Thus, for a general review of polyepoxy compounds reference may be made to Handbook of Epoxy Resins , Lee and Neville, McGraw Hill, 1967, Chapters 1 3 and Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology , Mark and Gaylord, Interscience Publishers, 1967, pages 209 270 Epoxy Resins . Thus by way of example the polyamide curing agents of the invention may be used in the curing of polyepoxy compounds derived from bisphenols, especially bisphenol A, such as those sold under the trade names Epikote 828 and 1001 Shell and D.E.R. 334 Dow . Similarly the polyamides may be used to cure hydrogenated polyepoxy compounds derived from bisphenols such as that sold under the trade name DRH 152 Shell . Other polyepoxy compounds which may be cured include flexible polyepoxy compounds such as that sold under the trade name Epikote 872 Hydantoin based polyepoxy compounds such as that sold under the trade name MS6064 by Ciba Geigy Epoxy acrylics such as those sold under the trade name Epirez 5027 and 50727 by Celanese polyepoxides derived from polyols e.g. glycerol triglycidyl ether as sold under the trade name G 1701 Grilonit and Sorbitol polyglycidyl ether sold under the trade name EX 612 Nagase and epoxy novolaks such as that sold under the trade name DEN 431 by Dow .
