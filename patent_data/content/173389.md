# Synchronous motor.

## Abstract
A hybrid stepping motor is described which comprises a stator with two annular coils 26, 24 which each cooperate with two sets of stator teeth 15, 17 and 14, 22 and a rotor with two rotor sections 5, 6 which are separated by an axially magnetized magnet 4 , which rotor sections 5, 6 each comprise two sets of rotor teeth 7, 8 and 9, 10 which each cooperate with one of said sets of stator teeth 13, 17 and 14, 22 . The various tooth offsets in this motor are obtained by providing an offset of 1 2 tooth pitch for each annular coil and by providing an offset of 1 4 tooth pitch between the two rotor sections 5, 6 .
