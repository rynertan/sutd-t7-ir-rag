# High voltage ignition transformer.

## Abstract
A high voltage ignition transformer is disclosed which is formed by a unitary core 11 mounting a primary winding 13 with said core being inserted in a cavity 35 of a bobbin 26 that mounts the secondary winding 44 . The secondary winding 44 is placed in alternate bays 27 31 of a multibay structure to isolate the windings from one another to avoid high potential breakdown. The assembly is completed by the mounting of the core within the cavity of the bobbin, but can be supplemented by covering the entire unit with a protec tive housing 60 that further aids in mounting the transfor mer to an insulating surface, such as a printed wiring board.
