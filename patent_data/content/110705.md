# Branch off clip.

## Abstract
A branch off seal between a recoverable sleeve 12 and two or more substrates 14 is effected using a clip the outer legs 1 of which are positioned over the outer surface of the sleeve 12 so as to form an appropriate number of conduits 13 . The clip is provided with an inner leg 15 comprising a heat activatable sealing material and a heat conductive mem ber of region. The dimensional integrity of the member or re gion weakens on activation of the sealing material. Thus the amount of heat or mechanical rigidity between the substrate is limited.
