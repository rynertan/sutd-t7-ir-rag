# Control systems for lift trucks.

## Abstract
A control system for directing hydraulic fluid to selected cylinders on a lift truck to perform selected power truck functions, includes a control lever mounted on the truck control panel and having upper and lower control positions and a neutral position therebetween. A function control switch 106 includes a manually actuatable switch button 38 on the control lever. Counter means 170 is responsive to the function control switch 106 to cycle sequentially through a plurality of count states from an initial count state in response to actuation of the function control switch 106 . Hydraulic means is responsive to the control lever and the counter means 170 for supplying hydraulic fluid to selected one of the cylinders under control of the control lever with selection of cylinders being determined by the count state of the counter means 170 .
