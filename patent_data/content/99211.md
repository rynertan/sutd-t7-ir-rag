# PROCESS FOR NITROGEN ENRICHMENT

## Abstract
In a pressure swing adsorption process for the produc tion of nitrogen enriched product gas from air, when the process is halted during a pressure equalisation step, that is, with valves 5 and 6 open to permit the flow of gas from one vessel 16 to a second vessel 16 , then the gas remaining in the vessels 16, 16 is exhausted to atmosphere by opening valve 14. This results in rapid return to the required purity of nitrogen enriched product gas on start up of the process. Preferably, subsequent to opening valve 14, valve 15 is opened, thereby permitting nitrogen rich product gas from reservoir 11 to flow through the vessels 16, 16 , thereby purging said vessels with nitrogen enriched product gas.
