# A process for preparing alkali metal amino alkanoates and use of same.

## Abstract
Alkali metal aminoalkanoate is prepared by contact ing in the presence of an alkali metal carboxylate a reaction mixture in which there is at least one alkali metal hydroxide, at least one lactam, and water. Arylene sulfide polymer is prepared by contacting at polymeri zation conditions a reaction mixture that contains at least one alkali metal aminoalkanoate prepared as de scribed above at least one polyhalosubstituted aromatic compound at least one organic amide as solvent and Hâ‚‚S. In an embodiment of the polymerization the organic amide used as solvent can be the same as the lactam from which the alkali metal aminoalkanoate was pro duced.
