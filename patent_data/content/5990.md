## Description
A method of repairing or modifying saddles and seats for motor cycles and cycles and units for use in such method This invention relates to a method of repairing or modifying a saddle or seat, for a motor cycle or cycle, having a metal base pan, resilient filling or cushioning material supported by said pan, and a cover or skin which covers said filling or cushioning material and to a unit for use in such method. The saddles or seats to which the invention more particularly relates are motorcycle saddles, motor cycle pillion seats, and combined saddles and pillion seats for motor cycles.A conventional form of motor cycle saddle or seat comprises a pressed metal base pan, resilient filling or cushioning material supported by the metal pan, and a cover or skin which covers the resilient filling or cushioning material and is secured to the metal pan. In the course of time, during use, the cover or skin of such a saddle or seat may split or otherwise require replacement, and the filling or cushioning material may become compressed to such an extent as to require replacement.Hitherto, a usual method of replace ent of the cover or skin and or the according to the invention, a replacement motorcycle saddle top or seat top unit comprising a moulded pan of light duty plastics material which supports resilient filling or cushioning material covered by a cover or skin secured to said plastics pan, said plastics pan serving as a carrier for the filling and cushioning material whereby the filling and cushioning material and the cover or skin are held in shape by reason of the securement of the cover or skin to the plastics pan, said plastics pan not being, or not needing to be, of such strength as to constitute a loadbearing member for adequately supporting by itself the load when the unit is in place on the machine and is occupied by the rider or riders, but said plastics pan being of such form as, when placed on the metal base pan, to be able to make close or intimate contact therewith over a sufficiently large area or areas to provide sufficient loadbearing support for said plastics pan when the latter is under load when the unit is in place on the machine and is occupied by the rider or riders.Since the plastics pan of such a replacement unit can be of substantially less cost than a loadbearing steel pan of similar size, the cost of repairing a saddle or seat by using such replacement unit can be considerably less than the cost of replacing a complete saddle or seat by a saddle or seat with a heavy duty metal base pan.A further advantage of a method according to the invention is that, in some instances, it does not require the metal pan to be removed from the machine. of the cover or skin to said inner face of the flange of the metal base pan.In the accompanying drawings, which show, by way of example, two embodiments of the invention the embodiment shown in Figures 4 and 5 being preferred to that shown in Figures 1 to 3 Figure 1 shows at the left, in underside perspective view, a replacement motor cycle saddle top unit constructed in accordance with the invention and for fitting to the existing pressed metal saddle base pan shown in perspective view at the right of saidFigure Figure 2 is a cross sectional view showing the replacement unit shown in Figure 1 fitted to said metal base pan shown in. said Figure, and shows also a trim strip secured by clips Figure 3 shows a portion of Figure 2 on a larger scale Figure 4 is a cross sectional view showing another embodiment of the invention andFigure 5 shows, at the top, a fragmentary underside perspective view of the replacement unit shown inFigure 4, and shows, at the bottom, a fragmentary top perspective view of the pressed metal base pan also shown in said Figure 4.Referring to Figures 1 to 3 of the drawings, a replacement motor cycle saddle top unit 1 is provided for fitting to an existing pressed steel saddle base pan 2 originally supporting resilient filling or cushioning material and a cover or skin which covered the filling or cushioning material, said filling and cushioning material and said cover the two applied together flanges 3, 7 to lie against the inner face of the flange 3 and is secured in place on said flanges by a suitable number of spring S clips 10. Each S clip 10 comprises two spring jaws 11, 12 extending in opposite directions, and a central limb 13 which connects the two jaws 11, 12, whereby the clip 10 has therein two oppositely directed channels 14, 15.The jaw 11 is provided at its outer end with integral barbs 16 pointing into the channel 14 and at its root end with integral barbs 17 pointing into the other channel 15. In the assembly shown, the clips 10 are positioned so that the channels 15 are securely engaged over the cover or skin folded over edge portion 6a folded over the applied together flanges 3, 7, with the barbs 17 engaging the said edge portion 6a, and with the clips 10 embracing and clipping together the applied together flanges 3, 7, the parts 12, 13 of said clips applying pressure, through the cover or skin portion 6a, to said flanges 3, 7. After thus securing the cover or skin edge portion 6a and clipping the flanges 3, 7 together by the clips 10, a U sectioned trim strip 18 is secured to the assembly by engaging said strip 18 into the channels 14 of the clips 10, as shown in Figure 2.The arrangement shown enables the cover or skin and resilient filling or cushioning which were originally present on the steel pan 2 to be replaced simply and inexpensively.Although it is preferred that the perimetrical edge 6a of the cover or skin and the flange 7 of the which covers the cus cning material 106. The moulded plastics pan 105 has an integral perimetrical flange 108 which depends adjacent, but outwards of, the flange 103 of the steel pan 102 and in this embodiment the lower edge of the cover or skin is not folded over a part of the steel pan, but is folded over the flange 108 of the plastics pan 105 and has its folded over edge secured, for example by adhesive, to the inner face of said flange 108, and the unit 101 is in this embodiment secured in place on the steel pan 102 by screw means, not by clips.Said screw means consists of a plurality of internally threaded members in the form of nuts 109 rigidly nonrotatably mounted on the plastics pan 105 and corresponding in number and positions to the number and positions of the aforesaid holes 104 and a corresponding number of externally threaded members in the form of screws 110 engaged, through the holes 10 with the nuts 109. The screws 110 consist of studs 111 oled into rubber heads 112. The plastics pan 1G5 serves as a carrier for the filling or cushioning material 106 whereby the material 106 and the cover or skin 107 are held in shape by reason of the securement of the cover or skIn n 107 to the pan 10F, said pan 105 being of a form such as, when placed on the steel pan 102, to make close or intimate contact therewith sufficient to enable the steel pan 102 to provide sufficient load bearinb support for said plastics pan 1C5 when the latter is under load when the unit 101 is in place on the machine and is occupied.The configuration of the underside of for fitting to the same metal base pan but one being suitable for general purpose use and the other for racing use, and he can then at will quickly interchange one unit with the other when required. The components of the unit 101 may be of any suitable materials.If desired, the screw means for securing the unit 101 to the steel base pan 102 may consist of externally threaded studs non rotatably carried by, and projecting downwards from, the moulded plastics pan 105, and nuts for screwing on to the lower ends of said screws after inserting said screws downwards through the holes in the steel base pan 102.If desired, instead of the replacement unit being of a form for fitting to a motor cycle or cycle saddle base pan, it may be of a form for fitting to the base pan of a pillion seat, or of a combined saddle and pillion seat.
