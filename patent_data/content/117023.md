# Coated spray nozzle tips.

## Abstract
A metal spray tip 34 for a fluid spray nozzle and a method of making such tip includes adhering a colored coating 24 so as to cover at least a portion of the exterior surface of the spray tip adjacent the spray orifice 30 in the tip. In one embodiment, the entire tip blank is first coated and then the orifice is formed in the coated blank to free the orifice of the coating and expose the metal of the tip at the orifice. In another embodiment, the orifice is first formed in a face of the tip and the tip face containing the orifice is then printed with the coating. In the latter embodiment, preferably only a portion of the exterior surface of the tip is coated to leave the metal exposed on some portions of the exterior surface. In still another embodiment of tip, a substantially flat exterior face 18 of the tip which does not contain the orifce may be coated.
