# Method of depositing a metal.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of depositing a metal on a heat conducting substrate, in which a surface 2 of the sub strate is irradiated at at least one area 3 in a bath by a laser beam and the metal is deposited from the bath at that area 3 on the substrate 1 . In order to improve the localization of the deposited metal at the irradiated area and in its immediate surroundings, ac cording to the invention, the metal is deposited on a layer 7 of the substrate 1 located at least at the irradiated area 3 and in its nonirradiated surroundings. The layer 7 has a heat conduction coefficient which is smaller than the heat conduction coefficient of the material of the substrate 1 adjoining the layer 7 .
