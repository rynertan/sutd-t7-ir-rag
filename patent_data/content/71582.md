## Description
Description of the invention entitled Device to apply paraffin for two for one twisters in the name of OFFICINE SAVIO S.p.A. at Pordenone This invention concerns a device to apply paraffin for two for one twisters which enables paraffin to be applied continuously to double twist yarn during the normal twisting cycle and substantially before said yarn is wound. It is envisaged in the known art that the application of paraffin to twisted yarn can be carried out after the twist . ing phase, and an extra winding operation is performed for this purpose. The use of devices to apply paraffin which are fitted di , rectly to the twisters and consist of a head holding a disk of paraffin and of an opposed head, said heads cooperating with each other, is also envisaged in the known art as described in DE OS 2316452, CH 378750 and US 3,358,641. The disk of paraffin is pressed by said holding head against suitable means that press the yarn, and against suit.able opposing face means which can be positioned axially and.are comprised in said opposed head as particularly disclosed, in CH 378750 and US 3,358,641. Said known devices to apply paraffin are costly and struc turally complex moreover, they do not permit easy handling of the disk of paraffin because of the particular action ap .plied to said disk by said head and said opposed head. A purpose of the invention is to embody an improved de .vice for applying paraffin in two for one twisters whereby said device can work advantageously on the double twist yarn.substantially before the latter is wound and spooled. Another purpose of the invention is to permit simple and fast working when fitting and removing the disk of paraf fin and when inserting the double twist yarn in the device in question that applies the paraffin. Yet another purpose of the invention is to be able to regulate the axial position of said disk of paraffin with adjustable presser means so as to obtain constant application of paraffin to the double twist yarn. Furthermore, said presser means are anchored very near to the device applying paraffin and can easily removed side way, and this enables the size of the whole device applying paraffin to be substantially and advantageously reduced. The device applying paraffin according to the invention can also be readily stopped from processing the twisted yarn. Moreover, the device in question for applying paraffin has been conceived in such a way that it does not permit a build up of impurities within or outside itself. In particular, said device applying paraffin comprises a stationary supporting structure anchored to a carrying bar, which also acts as an anchorage for the other devices applying paraffin on the same twister. Said structure rotatingly upholds a spindle and a drum with a seating for holding a disk of paraffin, whereby said spindle and said drum rotate and are reciprocally engaged by means of the paraffin disk rotated by the spindle which disk is pressed against its seating in the drum, and whereby said. drum can also slide coaxially on said structure so as to enable the position of said disk of paraffin to be adjusted axially. Said rotating spindle is revolved by means consisting of a belt and pulleys or gear wheel means, deriving its motion in a known manner from a common drive shaft disposed lengthwise along the twister. The device thus constituted for applying paraffin is located substantially upstream from the winding means comprised in the twisting head with which said device cooperates, and processes yarn which has already been twisted. The invention is therefore emboded in paraffin device located upstream from the winding means for a two for one twister head comprising support means for carrying a paraffin disk, means for bearing against the end ofthe paraffin disk against said support means, spring means for urging said support means against said bearing means and shaft means for rotating the paraffin disk, all carried by a fixed supporting structure, characterized by the fact that said support means consists of a hollow drum provided terminally with a seating for the paraffin disk, snugly mounted on the outside of a cylindrical supporting structure rotatingly, and internally carrying an externally driven shaft means extending centrally through said supporting structure and drum and projecting out of said seating for engaging the paraffin disk, there being provided internally to said drum compression spring means urging said drum axially away from said supporting structure. A preferential embodiment of this invention will be described hereinafter as a non restrictive example and reference will be made to the attached tables, wherein Fig. 1 shows a side view of the device applying paraffin in question Fig. 2 gives a diagram of a view from above of a detail of the device shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows a front view of the presser means employed in the device in question Fig. 4 shows diagrammatically a three dimensional view of the means which rotate the means holding the disk of paraffin .Fig. 5 shows diagrammatically a three dimensional view of a detail of the presser means employed in the device apllying paraffin in question. The same parts or parts performing the same functions bear the same reference numbers in the figures. The device to apply paraffin 10 which is the subject of.the invention is located substantially between the overfeed roll 11 for the double twist yarn 12 and the winding means 13 of the twister head 14. In particular, the device 10 to apply paraffin may cooperate with only one twister head 14 and, for this purpose,.be solidly fixed and fitted to anchorage means 63 which in this instance consistof a lengthwise carrying bar 15 shaped. blade wise and solidly connected 17 to the frame 16 of the twister itself. Said carrying bar 15 bears at least part of the devices 10 applying paraffin which are comprised in one and the same.twister, and is disposed knife wise with its shorter edges substantially upright so as to prevent a build up of impurities of the double twist yarn 12 running towards the winding means 13. The device 10 applying paraffin comprises rotating means.64 which hold a disk of paraffin 35. Said means 64 are upheld by supporting means 58, which comprise a carrying structure 18 that is anchored a 19 to the bar 15 and that includes a through seating 23 within which there can revolve freely a spindle 20, which is part of the rotating means 64 and is suitably supported by bear ing means 21. Said spindle 20 is made to rotate by entraining means 59 consisting of a belt or chain 24 that cooperates with a pulley 22 solidly keyed with a dowel 26 to the lower axial end 25 of said spindle 20. Said belt 24 takes its motion from transmission means 27 arranged lengthwise and able to drive at least part of the devices applying paraffin comprised in said twister. Said belt 24 cooperates with a pair of pulleys 28 29 in. transmitting rotation from the means 27, which has its axis substantially horizontal, to the spindle 20, which has its axis sloped diversely in relation to the horizontal Fig. 4 . Said pulleys 28 29 are revolvably anchored to a suitable carrying arm 30, which in this instance is solidly secured to the bar 15. A hollow sleeve 31 having a polygonal section, which is. square in our example, and at least partially flanged at its. lower end 32 is arranged to slidingly receive the upper end of the spindle 20. Said sleeve 31, which can slide on spindle 20, is ro tatingly engaged by said spindle 20 by means of splines 120 provided on the outside of the spindle cooperating with suit. abNe longitudinal slots provided inside sleeve 31.The sleeve 31 is received in a hole 60 of similare form provided in the seating 61. Said drum 34 can slide coaxially with respect to the sup. porting structure 18 and on the outside thereof and is nor mally kept in working position by thrust spring means 36, which is coaxial with the sleeve 31 and is kept compressed between the supporting structure 18 and the end wall 37 of the seating of said drum 34 said drum 34 can revolve togheter with said spindle 20 and is lodged, by means of its engage ment with sleeve 31 extending through hole 60 which has a polygonal section.The disk 35 of paraffin can be inserted axially in the seating 61 on the outside of said drum 34 and be kept in a pre set axial working position by suitable bearing means 38..Said bearing means 38 can press axially on the disk of paraffin 35 and, substantially, on the drum 34 and their ac . tion is opposed by the action of the thrust spring 36.The bearing means 38 comprises a stem 39, which can be positioned axially within a slide way 40 and be clamped there in with screw fixture means 41, which can be inserted into and cooperate with a seating or groove 51 located at least partially lengthwise on the outer surface of said stem 39, as shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, the axial position of said stem 39 can be finely adjusted with reference to a graduated scale 42 loc ated thereon, by means of a fixed index consisting here of the upper edge of the slide way 40. A presser element 43 is coaxially keyed to the top of said stem 39 and comprises a positionable cylinder 44 pro vided with a radial prong 45 which can be located so as to press on the disk 35 of paraffin. Said presser cylinder 44 can, be provided at its lower end with at least one recess 46, which can be engaged in the working position by an axially extending tooth 47 located on a circular ring 48 making part of the stem 39, as shown inFigs. 3 and 5. The presser element 43 stays in said lower engaged pos ition as it is pressed by a spring 49 located coaxially be tween an end flange 50 fixed to the stem 39 and an inner cir cular shoulder 52, which provides a lower bearing surface and is comprised in the cylinder 44 said springe 49 is pos . itioned in an anular interspace located betwen said cylinder 44 and said stem 39 and closed externally by the end flange 50 fixed terminally to the stem. To stop the presser means 38 working, it is enough to raise the element 43 in such a way as to free it from the stem 39, and then to revolve it so as to disengage the prong.45 from the disk of paraffin 35 and to keep it disengaged therefrom for the time desired. In this way the disk of paraffin 35 on the drum 34 can then be replaced or inserted once again if required. It is also possible to stop the working of the device 10 applying paraffin by pressing said drum 34 against the supporting structure 18 coaxially with said structure 18 and by clamping the stem 39 in its lower position within the slideway 40.The path of the yarn to be wound is determined not only by the rotation of the winding means 13 but also at least partially by a crosswise guide 54 for the yarn 12, said guide 54 being located upstream from the device applying paraffin 10 and anchored 53 to the stem 39, as shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Said crosswise guide 54 prevents the yarn 12 from leaving the edges of the upper working surface 55 of the disk of paraffin 35. The uniformity of application of paraffin to the yarn 12 is determined substantially by the axial position which the rotating disk of paraffin 35 is made to take up when acting on said yarn 12 running over it. If the working of the device applying paraffin 10 is stop. ped in the way described in the foregoing, the yarn 12 stays. in contact and cooperation only with the overfeed roll 11 and the winding means 13. The use can be envisaged of a protective cover 56 which includes a specially shaped hole 57 and which may possibly be equipped with guides for insertion of the yarn 12 the upper part of the device applying paraffin 10 can protrude through said cover. We have described here a preferential embodiment of the invention, but variants are possible for a technician in this field. Thus the shapes and sizes can be changed and it can be envisaged that the upper, outer surface 61 of the drum 34 comprises spike means 62 for better fixture of the disk of paraffin 35. The use can be visualised of gear wheel means to transmit motion to the spindle 20 so as to replace, at least partially, the belt and pulley means described and shown. It is also possible to envisage a separate motor means for each spindle 20. Moreover, it can be visualised that the anchorage of the device applying paraffin 10 can be effected directly on the bed or frame 16 of said twister by means of screw connecting means or clamp connecting means or any other means suitable for the purpose. These and other variants are all possible for a technician in this field within the scope of the idea of the inventive solution.
