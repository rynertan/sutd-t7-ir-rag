# Conversion of lower alcohols and ether derivatives thereof into hydrocarbons in a baffled reactor system.

## Abstract
A method for converting methanol to gasoline which al lows for the removal of reaction heat and the conversion of me thanol to hydrocarbons to be achieved efficiently is provided. The dense fluid bed is filled with vertically positioned half pipe sections 10 to maintain desired hydraulics and restricted bubble growth. Provision is made for cooling recycled catalyst and regenerating a portion of the catalyst used in the system. In the arrangement of the drawing figure the reactant feed is charged to a mixing zone 4 of the reactor vessel 2 . The va porous product is denuded of catalyst by cyclones 14 . The catalyst is withdrawn from the reactor vessel 2 and is passed to a separate catalyst stripping and cooling zone 20 . From this zone 20 the catalyst is conducted by conduit 36 to the mixing zone 4 . A portion of the catalyst is regenerated in a regenerator 42 .
