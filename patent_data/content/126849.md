## Description
NEW HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS, THEIR SYNTHESIS, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND THEIR USE IN MEDICINEThis invention relates to novel hydantoin derivatives suitable for use as therapeutic agents, and to novel intermediates of use in the preparation thereof.In UK patent specifications Nos.1,595,694 1,595,695 1,599,740 and 1,603,407, there are described certain hydantoin derivatives which have pharmacological properties related to those of natural prosteglandins, as demonstrated by their ability to mimic or antagonise the physiological effects of the natural prostaglandins in various biological preparations.We have now discovered that a novel class of hydantoin derivatives, defined hereinbelow in formula I , have particularly advantageous pharmacological properties such as are described below.In formula I EMI1.1 Z is hydrogen or alkyl represents a group of formula CH2 X X1 X2 wherein, X is selected from CH2 2 , and cis and trans CH CH , X1 is a covalent bond or a straight or branched alkylene chain having 1 to 6 carbon atoms optionally having one of its methylene groups replaced by oxa 0 or thia S provided that at least one carbon atom 2 separates the oxa or thia group from a carboxyl or CH CH group, and X is a carboxyl group and z2 represents a group selected from NH CH2 R and N CH R wherein, R is a group selected from CO Y andEMI2.1 Y being a group selected from C3 8 alkyl, C3 8 alkenyl, phenyl Cl 4 alkyl and phenyl wherein the phenyl group in both cases is optionally substituted by one or more groups independently selected from alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, halo and trihalomethyl , cycloalkyl of 4 to 8 carbon atoms, and 5or 6 membered heterocyclic radicals containing at least one heteroatom selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen and yl being a group selected from hydrogen, hydroxy, alkoxy and acyloxy.The present invention also includes the esters, amides, salts and solvates such as hydrates corresponding to the compounds of formula I . The present invention further includes bioprecursors or tpro drugsn of the above defined compounds according to the invention, namely compounds that are converted in vivo into compounds of formula I and their derivatives stated above.Unless the context indicates to the contrary, any reference hereinafter to a hydantoin, is a reference to a hydantoin derivative of formula I and esters, amides, salts and solvates corresponding to such compound When intended for administration to the human or animal body eg as described further hereinbelow such esters, amides, salts and solvates are those which are pharmacologically acceptable.Furthermore, in formula I and throughout this specification, unless specifically stated to the contrary, alkyl groups or the alkyl part of alkyl containing moieties such as acyl, are straight or branched and contain from one to four carbon atoms When Y is a 5 or 6 membered heterocyclic radical as defined above, the ring of the radical may be saturated or unsaturated, e.g. pyridyl, thienyl, tetrahydropyranyl or tetrahydrofuryl When Y is an aralkyl group, this may be a phenylalkyl group, for example benzyl. The above mentioned salts may be formed from those hydantoins of formula I wherein X2 is carboxyl and Z is hydrogen or alkyl, or where X2 is converted to the corresponding ester or amide and Z is hydrogen.Particularly valuable salts for medical purposes are those having a physiologically acceptable cation such as ammonium or that of an alkali metal e.g. sodium and potassium, an alkaline earth metal e.g. calcium or magnesium, or an organic base, particularly an amine such as tri hydroxymethyl aminomethane or ethanolamine. Salts having non physiologically acceptable cations are included within the ambit of this invention as useful intermediates for the isolation or purification of the corresponding compounds of formula I or their physiologically acceptable salts Except when there is clear indication to the contrary, formula U and other formulae In the specification embrace all stereolsomers represented therein.In particular such formulae include geometrical isomers having the t and anti configurations at the NSCH group, as well as diastereolsomers and individual enantiomers and racemic mixtures of these forms.Preferred hydantoins of formula I , by virtue of their advantageous pharmacological properties, include those wherein Z is hydrogen, Z1 is CH2X X1 X2 wherein X Is CH2 2 , X1 is an alkylene chain of 2 to 4 carbon atoms and x2 is carboxyl or a corresponding alkyl ester or a salt thereof and z2 is a group selected from NH CH R and N CH R wherein R is a group of formulaEMI3.1 in which y1 is hydroxy and Y is phenyl, alkyl of 3 to 8 carbon atoms or cycloalkyl of 4 to 8, particularly 6 carbon atoms.Within the scope of formula I is the sub class of hydantoins wherein z2 represents NH CH2 R as defined, and esters, amides, salts and solvates thereof. A further sub class comprises those hydantoins wherein z2 represents N CH R as defined, and esters, amides, salts and solvates thereof. preferred hydantoins according to the invention include 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 2 cyclohexyl 2 hydroxyethylamino hydantoin, 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 2 cyclohexyl 2 hydroxy ethylideneamino hydantoin, 5 6 carboxyhexyi 1 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyl ideneamino hydantoin and their esters, am ides, salts and solvates. The parent compounds may be provided in either of two isomeric forms, which for the first two of the aforementioned compounds are the diastereoisomer which is a viscous oil at 21 0C and the diastereoisomer which is a crystalline solid at 210C, the former diastereoisomer being especially preferred. The following hydantoins and their esters and salts are also preferred 5 6 carboxyhexyl i 2 cyclohexylethylideneamino hydantoin 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 2 hydroxyheptylideneamino hydantoin 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethylamino hydanto in 5 6 carboxyheXyl 1 t2 cyclohexyl 2 hydroxyethylamino 3 methylhydantoin In common with other known hydantoins, those of formula I have pharmacological properties related to those of natural prostaglandins and can, for example, in their broad pharmacological profile, mimic or antagonise the biological effects of members of the prostaglandin PG A , E3 , C , D , r , F and I series.The hydantoins according to the invention have been found to be advantageous in their pharmacological profile by virtue of their duration of action which is considerably more prolonged than that of previously known hydantoin derivatives and or unexpected high potency. In this respect, 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 2 cyclohexyl 2 hydroxyethylideneamino hydantoin and 5 6 carboxyhexyl 1 2 hydroxy 2 phenylethyiideneamino hydantoin and their esters and salts according to the invention have been found to have an exceptionally prolonged duration of action.In general, compounds, of formula I wherein y1 is hydroxy have been found to exhibit the prolonged duration of action, and those wherein yl is hydrogen have exhibited the unexpected high potency, although many of the compounds may exhibit both of these properties . The pharmacological profile, by which is meant the relative activities, mimetic or antagonistic, compared with the natural prostaglandins, will of course vary depending on the specific hydantoin under consideration. Therefore, having regard to the broad spectrum of activity of the natural prostaglandins, the potential utility of their antagonists and mimetics are diverse.Thus, the present invention may provide a hydantoin of formula I or a pharmacologically acceptable ester, amide, salt or solvate thereof for use in a method of prophylaxis or treatment of the human or animal body by therapy, especially where a prostaglandin antagonist or mimetic is indicated, eg for any of the dinical conditions described hereinafter.A particular advantage of the hydantoins according to the present invention is that they exhibit a prolonged and potent anti aggregatory effect on blood platelets. The hydantoins are thus useful whenever it is desired to inhibit platelet aggregation or to reduce the adhesive character of platelets, and may therefore be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of thrombo embolic disorders in mammals, including man.The reference herein to thrombo embolic disorders refers to disorders which are associated with undesired or increased platelet aggregation. In this role, it is believed that the hydantoins of formula I exhibit greater platelet binding than hydantoin derivatives previously known.The hydantoins are useful, for example, in the treatment and prevention of myocardial infarcts, thrombotic conditions, peripheral vascular disease, angina, as well as the promotion of patency of vascular grafts following surgery, and the treatment of complications of arteriosclerosis and conditions such as atherosclerosis, blood clotting defects due to lipemia, and other clinical conditions in which the underlying etiology is associated with lipid imbalance or hyperlipidemia A further use for such compounds is as additive to blood and other fluids which are used in artifical extra corporeal circulation and perfusion of isolated body portions, to prevent platelet aggregation. The hydantoins according to the present invention also cause relaxation of vascular smooth muscle in a similar way to members of the prostaglandin A and E series.Compounds relaxing vascular smooth muscle are capable of inducing vasodilation and therefore have antihypertensive properties and are useful in lowering the blood pressure in mammals, including man. Such compounds may be used alone or in combination with a ss adrenoceptor blocking agent or another antihypertensive substance for the treatment of all grades of hypertension including essential, malignant or secondary hypertension. It is advantageous for pharmaceutical agents intended for use in antihypertensive therapy, to have a prolonged duration of activity, and by virtue of their long acting properties referred to above, the hydantoins of the invention are valuable in such a clinical role.The half life of their vasodilatory effect which has been observed in experimental animals, has been found to be significantly greater than that produced by previously known prostaglandin mimetics of related structure. Furthermore, the observed decay profile has been found to be such that the total duration of the perceived vasodilatory effect is much greater relative to that produced by the known agents, than the half life values would suggest.Hydantoins of formula I which inhibit pentagastrin induced gastric acid secretion and reduce the formation of indomethacin induced gastric lesions in rats are useful in reducing excessive gastric secretion, reducing and avoiding gastro intestinal ulcer formation and accelerating the healing of such ulcers already present in the gastrointestinal tract whether such ulcers arise spontaneously or as a component of polyglandular adenoma syndromes.In addition, the hydantoins of formula I may be used in the treatment of proliferative skin diseases such as are associated with excessive cell division in the epidermis or dermis which may be accompanied by incomplete cell differentiation.Further applications of the hydantoins include inhibition of bronchoconstriction e.g.as induced by histamine or 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 HT . Hydantoins having this property may be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of bronchial asthma and bronchitis by alleviating the bronchoconstriction associated with such conditions.Hydantoins capable of antagonising histamine or 5 HT induced conditions may in general be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases which result from anaphylactic reactions such as response to an allergen.Hydantoins of formula I which mimic the uterine smooth muscle effects of PGE2 and PGF may be used as anti fertility agents, in particular as abortifacients. In some applications it is desirable that an effect or effects of a hydantoin other than its vasodilatory effect for example an anti platelet aggregatory effect be potentiated relative to the vasodilatory effect. We have found that this may be achieved by formulating a composition comprising a hydantoin of formula I or a pharmacologically acceptable ester, amide, salt or solvate thereof, and an agent which is a cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor for convenience, hereinafter termed a phosphodiesterase inhibitor . Such a composition constitutes a further feature of the present invention.Suitable phosphodiesterase inhibitors for use in potentiating the anti aggregatory effects on the hydantoins include the following compounds as such, or as pharmacologically acceptable salts a Xanthine derivatives such as Thedphyline 3,7 dihydro 1,3 dimethyl 1H purine 2,6 dione , Caffeine 3, 7 dihydro l, 3, 7 trimethyl lH purine 2, 6 dione and Aminophylline adduct of Theophylline and 1, 2 ethanediamine 2 1 . b Isoquinoline derivatives, for example Papaverine 1 3, 4 dimethoxyphenyl methyE6, 7 dimethoxyisoquinoline c Derivatives of pyrimido 5, 4dj pyrimidine, for example Dipyridamole 2, 2 , 2 , 2 4,8 dipiperidinopyrimido 5, 4 dipyrimidin 2, 6 diyl dinitrilol tetraethanol and its salts d Derivatives of thieno 3, 2 d3 pyrimidine, for example N 4 4 morpholinyl thieno 3, 2 d pyrimidin 2 yl 1, 2 ethanediamine. a Derivatives of pyrazolo 3 , 4 2, 3Spyrido44, 5 bHl, 5 benzodiazepin 6 3H one, for example 3 Ethyl 7, 12 dihydro 7, l2 dimethylpyrazolo44 , 3 S, 6j pyrido 4, 3 bibenzo diazepin 643H one f Derivatives of lH or 2H pyrazolo 3, 4 b3pyridine for example 4 Butylamino l ethyl 1H pyrazoloC3, 4 b pyridine 5 carboxylic acid ethyl ester and 2 Methyl 6 phenyl 4 l piperidinyl 2H pyrazolo 3, 4 b3pyridine g Derivatives of 5H furo43, 4 elpyrazolo43, 4 bjpyridine 5 one, for example 4 Butylamino l ethyl 1, 7 dihydro 7 hydroxy 5H furo 3, 4 e pyrazolo 3, 4 bl pyridine 5 one and h Derivatives of 1 2H naphthalenone, for example 2 Dimethylamino methyl 3, 4 dihydro 7 methoxy 1 2H naphthalenone. The amount of a hydantoin required to achieve the desired biological effect will of course depend on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the use for which it is intended, the mode of administration, and the recipient. In general, a daily dose may be expected to lie in the range of from 1 ng to 20 mg per kilogram bodyweight. For example, an intravenous dose may lie in the range of from 10 ng to 1 mg kg which may conveniently be administered as an infusion of from 0.1 ng to 50 ,ug per kilogram per minute. Infusion fluids suitable for this purpose may contain from 0.01 ng to 100 p9, for example from 0.1 ng to 100 pg per millilitre.Unit doses may contain from 100 ng to 100 mg of a compound of formula I , for example ampoules for injection may contain from 100 ng to 1 mg, and orally administrable unit dose formulations such as tablets or capsules may contain from 0.001 to 50, for example 0.02 to 20 mg. More specifically, when a hydantoin is used to inhibit platelet aggregation, it is generally desirable to achieve a concentration in the appropriate liquid, whether it be the blood of a patient or a perfusion fluid, of from 10 ng to 10mg, for example from 100 ng to 1 mg, per litre.The above mentioned doses refer to the acids and esters, of formula I where a salt is used, the dose should be taken as referring to the corresponding anion.For use in the treatment or prophylaxis of the conditions referred to above, while the hydantoin compounds may be used as the compound per se, they are preferably presented with an acceptable carrier therefor as a pharmaceutical formulation in accordance with the present invention. The carrier must of course be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, and is preferably formulated with a hydantoin compound as a unit dose formulation, for example a tablet, which may contain from 0.05 to 95 by weight of the hydantoin compound. Other pharmacologically active substances may also be presented in formulations of the present invention as indicated above.The hydantoin compounds may be incorporated in the formulations either in the form of an acid, salt or ester thereof, and the formulations may be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixture of the components of the formulation.The formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal e.g.sub lingual , parenteral e.g. subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated, and on the nature of the hydantoin compound.Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units such as capsules, cachets, lozenges or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of hydantoin compound as a powder or granules as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non aqueous liquid as an oil in water emulsion or as a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such formulations may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the hydantoin compound with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general they are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the hydantoin compound with liquid or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation.For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or moulding a powder or granules of the hydantoin compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the hydantoin compound in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agents . Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, the powdered hydantoin compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.Formulations suitable for buccal sub lingual administration include lozenges comprising a hydantoin compound in a flavoured basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth and pastilles comprising a hydantoin compound in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia.Formulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise sterile aqueous preparations of a hydantoin compound, which preparations are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. The preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also be effected by means of subcutaneous or intramuscular or intradermal injection.Such preparations may be conveniently prepared by admixing the hydantoin compound with water and rendering the product sterile and isotonic with the blood. Injectable compositions according to the invention will generally contain 0.1 to 5 w w of active ingredient.Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixture of the hydentoin compound with one or more of the conventional solid carriers, for example cocoa butter, and shaping of the resulting mixture.Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol or oil. Carriers which may be used include vasellne, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols and combinations thereof. The active ingredient is generally present In a concentration of from 0.1 to 15 w w of the composition, for example from about 0.5 to about 2 .The hydantoins may be prepared in any conventional manner and in accordance with the present invention, may for example be prepared by any method hereinafter described. Thus, according to the present invention we provide a process for the preparation of hydantoins of formula I and their above defined salts which comprises a for the preparation of hydantoins where z2 represents N CH R, wherein R is as defined above, reacting of a compound of formula II EMI9.1 wherein z and z1 are as defined above with a compound of formula III EMI9.2 wherein R is as defined above b for the preparation of hydantoins where z2 represents N CH R, wherein R is as defined above, reacting an appropriate compound of formula IV EMI10.1 wherein Z1 is as defined above, G is carboxy or a derivative thereof such as an amide derivative e.g. carbamoyl, or an ester thereof, particularly an alkyl ester or G may be cyano and M is a leaving group such as halo, preferably bromo with a compound of formula V ZHNCONHtCHR V wherein R and Z are as defined above 2 c for the preparation of hydantoins where Z represents N CH R, wherein R is as defined above, cyclising a compound of formula VI EMI10.2 wherein G, Z, Z1 and Zz are as defined above. d for the preparation of hydantoins where z2 represents N CH R, wherein R is as defined above, and Z is as defined above, treating a compound of formula VII EMI11.1 whereinR Is as defined above with methylmagnesium carbonate followed by reaction with a compound of formula VIII M Z1 VIII wherein M and z1 are as defined above and subsequently, if desired, effecting one or more of the following optional conversions in any desired order i where a hydantoin of formula I is formed and is an ester, converting said compound into a corresponding acid, or to a salt, solvate or amlde thereof ii where a hydantoin of formula I is formed and is an acid, converting said hydantoin into a corresponding ester, or to a salt, solvate or amide thereof iii where a hydantoin of formula I is formed wherein Z is hydrogen, converting said hydantoin into a corresponding hydantoin wherein Z is alkyl iv where a hydantoin of formula I is formed wherein R isEMI11.2 wherein y1 is an acyloxy group and Y is as defined above, converting said hydantoin into a corresponding hydantoin of formula I wherein y1 is a hydroxy group v where a hydantoin of formula I is formed wherein R is a group CO Y, converting the said hydantoin into a corresponding hydantoin of formula I wherein R is a group CH OH Y or vi converting the hydantoin of formula kI to the corresponding hydantoin where z2 represents NH CH2 R, wherein R is as defined above.The reaction in process a may be conveniently performed in an appropriate solvent, e.g. methanol.The reaction in process tb may be carried out by heating in the presence of a suitable base such as an alkali metal alkoxide, e.g. sodium ethoxide and optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent such as ethanol In process c the carboxyl derivative may, for example, be an amide or ester, in particular, an alkyl ester. The cyclisation may be performed under acidic conditions or by heating alone. The reaction may be effected in the absence of a solvent, but if desired an inert solvent may be used, for example, a hydrocarbon such as petrol.Alternatively, where G is alkoxycarbonyl, cyclisation may be effected in the presence of a suitable base, for example an alkoxide such as sodium ethoxide.In the process d the compound of formula VI may be in a suitable solvent such as dimethylformamide. If, in the above process, it is desired to separately isolate one or both diastereoisomers of a compound of formula I , where an appropriate compound exists in mixed isomeric form, separation of the isomers may conveniently be performed in conventional manner, e.g. by h.p.l.c.Compounds of formula II may be prepared by hydrogenation of a compound of formula IX EMI12.1 wherein Z and Z1 are as defined above, and Ph represents phenyl under suitable condition.. Convenlently, such hydrogenatlon may be performed at elevated pressure in the pretence of a palladlum charcoal catalyst. If desired, the reaction may be carried out with heating.A compound of formula UI may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula X EMI13.1 wherein G Is as defined above with cyanic acid or an alkyl isocyanate, depending respectively, on whether Z is hydrogen or alkyl.When cyanic acid is used, the cyanic acid is conveniently produced in situ by the use of an alkali metal cyanate, e.g. potassium cyanate, and an acid which may be present as an acid addition salt of the compound of formula X or a free acid of formula X wherein either or both of R and X2 is hydrogen. Alternatively an equivalent amount of mineral acid or an organic acid may be added to the reaction medium.

Where desired, for example if no solvent is used, the reaction may be promoted by heating the reactants. Similar reaction conditions may be used when an alkyl iso cyanate is used except that it is unnecessary to provide an equivalent amount of acid, as an acid addition salt or otherwise, in the reactants.Instead of using a cyanate or isocyanate, a compound of formula X may be reacted with urea, nitrourea of an N alkylurea as appropriate. A solvent is not essential but if desired an inert solvent such as one mentioned above may be used, and the reaction is preferably effected at an elevated temperature, for example from 1000 to 12500 but temperatures upto 15000 may be employed.

IN VITRO ACTIVITYInhibition of platelet aqoregationHuman blood was freshly collected into siliconized Siloclad Clay Adams plastic Sterilin Ltd. vessels containing trisodium citrate 3.15 0.1 volume with 0.9 volume blood and centrifuged 200 g for 15 min at room temperature. The platelet rich plasma PRP was withdrawn into plastic containers and kept at room temperature.Inhibition of platelet aggregation was determined in a Born type aggregometer by incubating aliquots 0.5 ml of the PRP for 1 min at 370C with or without the hydantoin prior to addition of sufficient adenosine diphosphate ADP or other aggregating agent to just cause a non reversing control aggregation. Dose inhibition curves were constructed for each compound and the ID50 dose causing 50 inhibition was calculated as the dose required to reduce the aggregation to 50 of its control amplitude. Results show potency following the I minute incubation in PRP and the increase in potency following 5 10 minutes incubation in PRP.For comparison, also given are the results upon administration of 5 6 carboxyhexyi l 3 cyclohexyl 3 hydroxypropyl hydantoin Compound X which is disclosed in UK Specification 1,595,694.In this and subsequent biological examples, where a compound number refers to a single diastereoisomer, a mixture of diastereoisomers is indicated by two compound numbers separated by .Compound No. IC50 Potency Increase on 50 Ú ngml relative to Incubation PUG12 min 5 10 3 16 0.02 x7 x20 6 2 0.30 x5 x20 8 24 0.05 11 1 0.53 x8 17 131 0.01 x2 17118 8 0.12 x2 Compound No. IC50 Potency Increase on Cngml I relative to Incubation PGI2 min 5 10 25 26 13 0.06 x6 29 6 0.16 x7 30 0.9 0.64 x6 33 5.3 0.07 x2 34 175 0.003 33 34 6 0.17 x2 35 12.7 0.05 x1.5 35136 1.27 0.49 x1.5 37138 3 0.18 x7X 1.5 0.21 x2 x3EX VIVO ACTIVITYDetermination of rabbit platelet aggregation and concurrent change in systemic arterial blood presure Male rabbits C2 2.5 kg body weight were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone 30 mg kg, i.v. followed by maintenance doses of 3mg kg and systemic arterial blood pressure BP was recorded from a cannula filled with heparinized saline CS units ml in a carotid artery no heparin was administered to the animal. Hydantoins were administered via a cannula in a femoral vein. Blood samples t1.5 ml were slowly collected into a plastic syringe containing tri sodium citrate 3.18 , 0.15 ml from a cannula inserted into a femoral artery, shaken gently and transferred to an Eppendorf plastic tube and spun in a modified Eppendorf centrifuge for 2 sec Model 5412, maximum centrifugal force 10,000 x g .The PRP was collected and a 0.35 ml aliquot was transferred to the aggregometer and incubated at 370C for 1 minute prior to addition of sufficient ADP 20 I1M to produce near maximal aggregation. The time interval between removal of blood samples and the transference of the PRP to the aggregometer was less than 1.5 min.Blood samples were removed at 10 min. intervals once the BP of the rabbit had reached steady resting levels, 10 20 min. following the preparative surgical procedures. After three control blood samples had been prepared and the control aggregation of the platelets measured, the hydantoin was infused intravenously for 15 min from a Braun slow infusion apparatus. Blood samples were collected 10 min after the start of the infusion. Two further 10 min. samples post infusion were collected prior to commencing further infusions. The following results list values of ED50 and change in blood pressure.

However, at these doses, compounds 3 and 6 demonstrated no significant blood pressure depressant activity, in contrast to the two known agents. IN VIVO ACTIVITY a Cardiovascular actions In ratsAnaesthesia was induced in male Wistar rats 250 300 g body weight with sodium pentobarbitone C30 mg kg1, i.v. and supplemented 3 mg kg l when required.Arterial pressure was recorded from a cannulated femoral artery and heart rate derived from the arterial pulse. Rectal temperature was maintained at 370C by thermistor controlled radiant heat. Each compound was injected into a femoral vein In a volume of 0.25 ml and flushed in with 0.2 ml of saline 0.9 w v . Dose response relationships for the fall in mean systemic arterial blood pressure BP with the hydantoins were constructed and compared to those obtained with PGI2 and PGE1 in the same animal, and a potency ratio calculated. An index of the duration of the hypotensive effect for each compound was obtained by measuring time from the peak response to when it had recovered to half its peak response Ct min .Figures forCompound X and PGI2 are listed for comparison.Compound Fall in BP Duration Relative Potency ti mins PGI PGE 2 1 3 0.027 0.324 11.0 6 0.041 0.5 17.0 8 0.01 0.11 1.0 11 0.1 1.1 16.0 17 0.01 0.12 3.5 17 18 0.04 0.48 10 19 25126 0.09 1.08 9 29 0.02 0.24 37 30 0.02 0.24 28 33 34 0.02 0.24 6 35 0.01 1.3 35 36 0.06 37 38 0.03 0.36 17 X 0.06 0.72 4.0 PGI2 I 11.0 0.3 b Cardiovascular studies in the doq Dogs 10 15 kg body weight were anaesthetized with chloralose 80 mg kg i.v. and maintained with subcutaneous injections of pentobarbitone 3 mg kg .
