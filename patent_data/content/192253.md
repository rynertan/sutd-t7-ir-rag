# Boom assembly.

## Abstract
A portable light weight robot arm assembly simulating shoulder, elbow, and wrist movements of a human arm, plus extensions of the upper arm and forearm, accurately posit ions and holds a power tool H for performing driving, drilling, chipping, lifting and the like operations at a work site. The assembly is self contained having a base 11 easily and quickly mounted on a conventional truck T or on the ground R at the work site, a carriage 12 shiftable longitu dinally and transversely on the base, an upright pedestal 13 tiltable in all planes relative to the base, an extensible boom or upper arm 14 rotatably and swingably mounted on the pedestal, and an extensible power tool suspension arm or forearm 17 pivoted to the upper arm. Hydraulic jacks control the lowering, raising, and extension of the boom, the tilting of the pedestal, the positioning of the carriage, the extension and positioning of the forearm, and the position of the tool. An hydraulic motor controls the rotation of the pedestal and a hydraulic motor can also operate a winch 19 on the boom. The jacks and motor are selectively activated from a portable station, such as a hand held switch unit, permitting freedom of movement of the operator to best observe the work. The upper arm is swung and tiltable about its shoulder 67 80 on the pedestal and extended or retracted to position its outer end or elbow 16 . The forearm is suspended on the elbow to position the tool, extended to load the tool, and the tool is held by the wrist end P of the forearm in its desired position on the work.
