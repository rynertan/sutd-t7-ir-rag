# Hydrogenolysis of polyols to ethylene glycol in nonaqueous solvents.

## Abstract
Process for hydrogenolysis of polyols to ethylene glycol in nonaqueous solvents yields high conversion to ethylene glycol in presence of at least about 10 mol percent of a strong base at a temperature of 235 C to 315 C.
