# Biochemical process for reacting hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A biochemical process and apparatus for use in the pro cess are described. The process comprises reacting a a hyd rophobic substrate with b a solution or dispersion compris ing a hydrophilic substrate and an enzyme catalyst, by con tacting through a porous thin membrane, wherein the hyd rophobic and hydrophilic substrates are incompatible with each other. The apparatus comprises a main body and a porous thin membrane provided inside the main body so as to define therein at least two channels, wherein a hydrophobic substrate and a solution or dispersion comprising hydrophilic substrate and an enzyme catalyst are contacted through the thin membrane by passing them through the respective channels.
