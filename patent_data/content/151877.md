## Description
This invention relates to perfluoropolyether oligomers and polymers. In another aspect, it relates to a process for the preparation of such materials from hexafluoropropylene epoxide and diacid fluorides. In another aspect, it relates to difunctional perfluoropolyether polymers and a photopolymerization process for the preparation thereof. In a still further aspect, it relates to poly perfluoroalkyleneoxy polymers terminated with acid fluoride groups and derivatives thereof. Perfluoropolyethers, though developed over the last two decades or so, are still considered a relatively new class of chemical substances. Sometimes they are named in the art as poly perfluoroalkylene oxides , poly perfluoroalkyleneoxy substances, or fluorocarbon ethers . They usually have one or two types of repeating perfluoroalkyleneoxy units that form a backbone or linear chain of catenary carbon and oxygen atoms, which chain in the case of compounds or oligomers is terminated with functional and or nonfunctional groups. Generally, the perfluoropolyethers have relatively high temperature and chemical resistance, nonflammability, low glass transition temperatures, oil and water repellency, anti corrosivity, and have surfactant, lubricating, and high dielectric strength characteristics, useful properties which have stimulated much development or application activity. Several general types of perfluoropolyethers have been described in the literature. The earliest type is characterized by one or several homopolymeric segments or blocks of repeating units of the formula CF CF₃ CF₂O and made from hexafluoropropylene epoxide, e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 3,250,807. Another type is that characterized by blocks of repeating units of the formula CF₂CF₂O and made from tetrafluoroethylene epoxide, e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 3,125,599. Others, made by reacting oxygen with tetrafluoroethylene or hexafluoropropylene, are characterized by a backbone made of repeating CF₂O units, e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 3,392,097, or CF CF₃ CF₂O units, e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 3,442,942, or, in addition to either of these units, units of the formula CF CF₃ O , e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 3,699,145, or a backbone consisting of randomly distributed CF₂O and CF₂CF₂O units, e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 3,715,378, or a backbone made up of CF CF₃ CF₂O and CF₂CF₂O units and, optionally, CF₂O and CF CF₃ O units. Another type of perfluoropolyether is that characterized by backbone units of the formula CF₂ The backbones of these prior art perfluoropolyethers are variously terminated with functional groups, e.g., COF, or nonfunctional inert moieties, e.g., CF₃. Various patents disclose a host of functional derivatives of the perfluoropolyethers, e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 4,094,911 Mitsch et al which discloses perfluoropolyethers terminated with polymerizable functional groups. U.S. Pat. No. 3,810,875 Rice et al discloses use of perfluoropolyethers with ethylenically unsaturated monomers in making block copolymers. Perfluoropolyethers with nonfunctional terminal moieties are sold under the trademarks KRYTOX and FOMBLIN for use as vacuum pump fluids, e.g., see G. Caporiccio et al, Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev. 1982, 21, 515 519. Of particular relevance to the instant invention is U.S. Pat. No. 3,637,842 Stump et al , which discloses the preparation of perfluoropolyether polymers of the formula X CT CF₃ O CF₂ The invention provides a liquid perfluoropolyether substance comprising one or a mixture of polyether compounds each consisting essentially of a plurality of perfluoropolyether segments bonded together in a chain each of which segments consist essentially of 1 at least one perfluoroisopropyleneoxy unit, 2 a bis perfluoromethyleneoxy terminated unit of the formula OCF₂ R COOCH₃ is an exile of a functional derivative and CF₃ is an example of a nonfunctional derivative. A class of said perfluoropolyethers can be represented by the formula where each A preferred subclass of the oligomers or polymers are those represented by the formula I where Z is selected from the group consisting of H, X, CF₂H, CF₂X, CH₂OH, COX, COR, COOH, COOM₁ y, COOR, CF₂R, CH₂OC O CR CH₂, CON R R , CH₂NH₂, CH₂NCO, CN, C₃N₃ R For brevity, the portion of the above described perfluoropolyethers, excluding the terminal groups, Z, will occasionally hereafter be referred to as the perfluoropolyether chain or PPE . The perfluoropolyether polymers of this invention can be prepared by two steps 1 the condensation or addition reaction of a perfluoroaliphatic diacid or diacyl fluoride, FOC R The condensation of perfluoroaliphatic acid fluorides with HFPO generally can be carried out as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,250,807 Fritz et al . For example, it can be carried out in an aprotic solvent e.g. diglyme in a molar ratio of HFPO to diacid fluoride of at least 3 1 and in the presence of anhydrous alkali metal fluoride catalyst e.g. KF . The resulting acid fluoride adduct product comprises or consists essentially of a mixture of difunctional oligomers, e.g. 90 to 95 wt. or more and usually contain a small amount, e.g. up to 5 to 10 wt. of impurities, typically monofunctional acid fluorides, which can be removed by distillation to provide perfluoropolyethers which consist or consist essentially of the above described oligomers. The UV catalyzed coupling reaction of the resulting acid fluoride adduct product can be carried out as described by J. F. Harris, Jr. in J. Org. Chem. The various acid fluoride derivatives of this invention the terminal or end groups of which are encompassed by Z in formula I can be made by known derivative techniques, such as described in said U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,250,807 Fritz et al. and 4,094,911 Mitsch et al . The di methylcarboxylate , i.e., the polymers of forumla I where Z is COOCH₃, is particularly useful as an intermediate in the preparation of a host of derivatives useful in a variety of applications, such as described in said U.S. Patent No. 4,094,911. In preparing the perfluoropolyether of this invention, it has been found particularly useful to photolyze the distilled acid fluoride terminated HFPO adducts dissolved in an inert fluorocarbon solvent using a 450 watt medium pressure mercury lamp located inside a water cooled quartz sleeve, the lamp sleeve assembly being immersed in the fluorocarbon solvent HFPO adduct solution. Irradiation can be carried out in a satisfactory manner at 25 to 40 C ambient conditions, no external cooling or warming for varying times, e.g. 3 to 15 hours. The extent of chain coupling polymerization can be monitored by withdrawing small samples of the fluorocarbon solution and measuring changes in viscosity. The perfluoropolyether polymer products can be isolated, for example by distillation or vacuum stripping of low boiling materials. Molecular weight of the products can be determined by end group analysis utilizing F nmr and acid base titration. Said U.S. Pat. No. 4,094,911 describes techniques for the preparations of a host of COF derived derivatives of another class of perfluoropolyethers and U.S. Pat. No. 3,950,588 McDougal describes a technique for preparing perfluoropolyethers with CONH CH₂ An illustrative overall outline for the synthesis of perfluoropolyethers of this invention from HFPO and perfluorosuccinyl fluoride is as follows where a b is at least 1 Representative reactions for the preparations of said perfluoropolyether derivatives of this invention are shown in Schemes 1 20. Representative diacid fluoride compounds, FOC R Particularly useful perfluoropolyether adduct or oligomer products of this invention are those having a number average molecular weight range of about 542, where R The inert oligomers can also be used as lubricants for magnetic media, for example, like the polyethers in U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,828 Knope et al . The functional perfluoropolyethers of this invention can be used in a host of applications, for example, the same applications disclosed in the prior art for the related, similarly functional, perfluoropolyethers having a backbone made up of The acid and hydroxyl functional polyethers of this invention can also be used to form bladders, seals, O rings, gaskets, adhesives, coatings, etc., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,637,842. Those terminated with silyl groups, such as the product of Scheme 19, supra, can be used in the treatment of substrates or articles having silanol reactive surfaces, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,950,588 McDougal . Other applications are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,810,875 Rice et al , 3,637,842 Stump , and 3,250,807 Fritz et al . Objects and advantages of this invention are illustrated in the following examples, which should not be construed to unduly limit the invention. Thirty ml bis 2 methoxyethyl ether diglyme , which was dried by distillation from sodium, was placed in a dry flask fitted with a dry ice cooled condenser, mechanical stirrer, gas inlet tube, and thermometer. Potassium fluoride 1.2 g , which was dried in a vacuum oven for 6 hrs. at 150 C, was weighed under a dry nitrogen atmosphere and transferred into the flask under a nitrogen stream. Tetrafluorosuccinyl fluoride 23.5 g was condensed in a dry ice cooled trap 78 C and transferred into the reaction flask via rubber tubing connected to the gas inlet tube by inverting the trap. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 30 min. and the flask was cooled in a 22 C bath dry ice CCl₄ and 62 g HFPO was added over a 2 hour period at such a rate that inlet and outlet pressures were balanced. Stirring under a dry nitrogen atmosphere at 22 C was continued for 1 hr. and the cooling bath was removed. The reaction mixture was then stirred at ambient conditions for an additional hour and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. Sixty ml of Freon 113 was added and the mixture stirred for 5 min. and poured into a separatory funnel. The phases were allowed to separate, and the lower phase, comprising crude HFPO succinyl fluoride adduct product, was distilled at atmospheric pressure. Boiling ranges of the fractions or cuts obtained are shown in Table 1. Gas liquid chromatographic GLC and fluorine nuclear magnetic reasonance F nmr analysis of the distilled liquid products support the structure of the adduct product as represented by formula I supra where R The overall yield of adduct based on diacid fluoride 80 tetrafluorosuccinyl fluoride was 81 . A 60.2 g mixture of HFPO tetrafluorosuccinyl fluoride adduct fractions prepared as described above, and consisting of 12 wt. of the 2 1 adduct, 26 wt. of the 3 1 adduct, 41 wt. of the 4 1 adduct, and 17 wt. of the 5 1 adduct, was dissolved in 340 g dry FC 75 fluorocarbon solvent and placed in an immersion type photoreactor under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was irradiated with a 450 watt medium pressure mercury ultraviolet lamp for 4.75 hrs. The viscosity of the reaction solution was monitored about every hour. The viscosity increased from an initial value of 1.08 cs at 23 C to 1.30 cs at 23 C when the reaction was stopped. The reaction mixture containing the perfluoropolyether photopolymer of this invention having structure depicted in formula I, where R Following the procedure of Example 1, 43.5 g oxybis difluoroacetyl fluoride was dissolved in 60 ml diglyme containing 1.00 g dry potassium fluoride. To this stirred misture was added 122.7 g HFPO and the reaction mixture allowed to stir overnight with gradual warming to room temperature. The lower phase 96.1 g of the reaction mixture, comprising crude HFPO oxybis difluoroacetyl fluoride adduct, was distilled through a Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure. Boiling ranges are shown in Table 4. Fractions 3 through 5 were combined and analyzed by F nmr. The analytical results supported the structure of the combined adduct fractions as one like that designated A in the overall synthesis outline supra except that the central unit was O CF₂ ₂O CF₂ ₂O . A 42.2 g mixture of distilled HFPO oxybis difluoroacetyl fluoride adducts, prepared as described in Example 2, was dissolved in 400 g FC 75 solvent and irradiated for 13 hrs. using the apparatus and procedure of Example 1. The FC 75 solvent was distilled at atmospheric pressure and remaining material distilled at 0.1 torr. Two fractions were obtained, the first 19 g boiling at 25 160 C, and the second 18.9 g boiling at 160 260 C. F nmr analysis of the second fraction was consistent with a structure like that of formula I, where R A 56.1 g mixture of HFPO tetrafluorosuccinyl fluoride adducts having the same composition as described in Example 3 was dissolved in 316 g of FC 75 fluorocarbon solvent and irradiated for 4.5 hrs. using the apparatus and procedure of Example 3. The viscosity of the reaction solution at 23 C was 1.37 cs. Distillation gave 4 g unreacted adducts boiling at 110 135 C and three fractions of photopolymer, viz., 1., 5.3 g boiling at 55 135 C at 0.2 torr, 2., 26.2 g boiling at 155 300 C at 0.2 torr, and 3., 12.6 g pot residue. The structure and molecular weight of the above three perfluoropolyether photopolymer fractions as determined by F nmr are presented in Table 5. The following example describes the conversion of the acid fluoride end groups of perfluoropolyether photopolymers of this invention to hydride end groups. Perfluoropolyether photopolymer 14.9 g prepared as described in Example 1 was placed in a flask fitted with a thermometer, Vigreux column, and distillation head. Fifteen ml ethylene glycol and 15 ml 2.5 molar KOH solution aqueous were added to the reaction flask and the reaction mixture heated to 140 C. Vigorous foaming took place and water distilled out of the reaction mixture via the distillation head. When no further foaming was observed and all the water had distilled out of the flask, the pot temperature was gradually increased until it reached 200 C. Heating was continued for an additional 2 hrs., then 50 ml FC 75 and 150 ml water were added. The reaction mixture was agitated and the lower phase was separated and dried over silica gel. Removal of the FC 75 solvent at reduced pressure gave 11.4 g residual liquid product. Infrared analysis indicated the complete absence of any carbonyl absorption. Distillation at 0.2 torr gave a fraction 76 wt. of the total boiling at 145 287 C, which was analyzed by F nmr and H nmr. The following end groups were found for the perfluoropolyether fraction OCFHCF₃ major , OCF₂CF₂CF₂H, OCF₂CF₂CF₃, and OCF CF₃ CF₂H. This example describes the conversion of hydride terminated, perfluoropolyether photopolymer to chloride terminated polymer. Hydride terminated polymer 19.9 g , prepared as in Example 4, was placed in a flask and heated to 200 C, then chlorine gas was bubbled into the liquid polymer over a 6 hour period while the heating was continued. An H nmr analysis run after 4 hrs. of chlorination indicated that only about 10 wt. of the terminal hydrogen atoms were still present. At the end of the 6 hour chlorination, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool and excess chlorine was removed under reduced pressure employing a water aspirator. A total of 18.2 g of perfluoropolyether product was obtained. F nmr indicated the presence of only the following end groups OCF Cl CF₃ major , OCF₂CF₂CF₂Cl, OCF CF₃ CF₂Cl, OCF₂Cl, and OCF₂CF₂CF₃. This example describes the direct preparation of chloride terminated perfluoropolyether photopolymer from acid fluoride terminated polymer having the structure of formula I where R End group analysis from the above F nmr data indicated a molecular weight for the perfluoropolyether of 2657. The viscosity temperature properties of the hydrogen and chlorine terminated perfluoropolyether photopolymers of the invention were measured and compared with a chlorine terminated perfluoropolyether polymer of known backbone structure and a commercial perfluoropolyether non functional fluid. The results are presented in Table 7. This example describes the preparation of a methyl carboxylate terminated perfluoropolyether photopolymer. A photopolymer 15.0 g having the structure of formula I, where R This example describes the preparation of a methylol terminated perfluoropolyether photopolymer. Sodium borohydride 0.23 g was slurried in 15 ml dimethoxyethane. Photopolymer 5 g having the structure of formula I, where R This example describes the preparation of N 2 hydroxyethyl carboxamide terminated perfluoropolyether photopolymer. Aminoethanol 0.5 g was dissolved in 15 ml dimethoxyethane in a 100 ml flask. Photopolymer 5.0 g having the structure of formula I, where R This example describes the preparation of the acrylate of the methylol terminated perfluoropolyether photopolymer. Methylol terminated photopolymer of Example 9 45 g was dissolved in 50 ml Freon 113 and then 3.55 g dry triethylamine was added. Acryloyl chloride 3.3 g dissolved in 50 ml Freon 113 was added over a 10 min. period. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. At the end of the reaction period, 1.1 ml triethylamine and 1.2 ml of water were added. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 1 hr. then filtered through Super Cel diatomaceous earth filter aid. The filter cake was washed with 100 ml Freon 113 and the fluorocarbon phases combined. The resulting solution was acidified with anhydrous HCl and then filtered through Super Cel . Freon 113 was removed under reduced pressure at ambient temperature. A total of 45.7 g of yellow oil was obtained. Infrared and H nmr analyses of the oil were consistent with the structure of formula I, where Z is CH₂OCOCH CH₂ and R Following the procedure of Example 1, 18.8 g of perfluoro N propylamino N,N dipropionyl fluoride was dissolved in 60 ml diglyme containing 2.0 g dry cesium fluoride. To this stirred mixture was added 25.7 g of HFPO and the reaction mixture allowed to stir overnight with gradual warming to room temperature. The lower fluorocarbon was then removed and distilled at atmospheric pressure. A total of 16.0 g distilled between 45 150 C, 7.5 g between 150 190 C, and 11.4 g between 210 230 C. F nmr analysis of the two highest boiling fractions supported a product having a mixture of structures of formula I where in some structures a b 0 and in others a b 1 where R
