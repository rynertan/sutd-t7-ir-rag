# METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF HIGH CONVERSION SYRUPS AND IMMOBILIZED ALPHA AMYLASE EMPLOYED IN THE PROCESS

## Abstract
A method for production of high conversion syrup wherein a liquefied starch is hydrolyzed with an α amylase covalently immobilized inside a carrier substance. Use of the novel immobilized α amylase provides a single step reaction wherein the liquefied starch solution is converted into a high conversion syrup through the action of a single en zyme. Preferred α amylases are acid stable α amylases derived from Aspergillus and a well suited acid stable α amylase is de rived from Aspergillus niger strain DSM 2761.
