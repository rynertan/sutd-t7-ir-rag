# Body from resilient foam material, such as a buffer, a seat cushion or mattress from foam rubber or synthetic foam material.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a body from resilient foam material, such as a buffer, a seat cushion or a mattrass from foam rubber or synthetic foam material, which body has been provided with a plurality of slits 2 within which spring elements 3 are enclosed in tight fitting, which in loaded condition are in contact with the two walls of the slit and cannot shift with respect to the slit walls. Said spring elements in unloaded condition are substantially free of tension and do have a spring characteristic equal to or hardly different from the characteristic of the foam material. The normally fall off of the rigidity of the resilient foam bodies by this has been completely obviated due to which cheaper foam materials can be used, in particular those which therewith also have a greater softness.
