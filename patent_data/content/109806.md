# Butterfly or ball valve.

## Abstract
In order to provide an unobstructed outer face 7 on a retaining ring 4 for the seal assembly of a butterfly valve, so that the face 7 can make an improved seal with an adjacent pipe end, the retaining ring 4 is held captive in the valve housing 1 by a wire ring 11 , instead of by the usual screws which penetrate the face 7 and inhibit sealing with the pipe end. The wire ring is of regular polygonal shape such that the central portions 14 of its sides are received in a radially outwardly facing groove 10 in the retaining ring, and its corners 16 are received in a radially inwardly facing groove 8 in the housing. A helical lead in groove 15 in the housing connects with the groove 8 to permit assembly of the retaining ring to the housing by a screwing action.
