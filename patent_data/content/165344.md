## Description
ROOF AND WALL SEAL ASSEMBLIES This invention relates to roof and wall seal assemblies, particularly but not exclusively to roof and wall seal assemblies for sealing a chimney aperture in a metal roof or wall against water running down the roof or wall. Metal roofs and walls for factories and other buildings are commonly constructed from sheets of galvanised steel that are provided with transversely spaced corrugations which may be of various shapes. The sheets are laid with the corrugations extending down the roof slope or wall and with the edges and ends of the sheets overlapping. A first aspect of the invention is concerned with the problem that when a hole is cut in such a roof or wall sheet, for example to receive a chimney, it has been found extremely difficult in practice to seal the hole against water that runs down the roof or wall toward the hole. According to the first aspect of the invention a roof or wall seal assembly for sealing a hole in a roofing or wall sheet against water that runs down the sheet towards the hole comprises a substantially rigid, apertured apron of which at least the outer margin is shaped to seat against the exterior surface of the sheet around the hole, and the aperture in the apron is surrounded by an upstanding wall that is sealingly connected with the apron, that portion of the outer margin of the apron that faces upwardly in use being provided in its underside with at least one recess extending substantially from one side of the apron to the other side and containing a mastic for effecting a seal between that marginal portion and the sheet. The apron and upstanding wall may be of metal, but preferably the apron and wall are moulded from an exterior grade plastics material such as is used for rainwater goods. The apron and wall are preferably then an integral moulding. Injection moulding or vaccum forming processes may be employed, and the thickness of the apron is preferably kept to a minimum, commensurate with the requirement for sufficient strength, in order to minimise hold up of water on the roof above the apron. The upper margin of the apron may extend substantially in a horizontal straight line from one side of the apron to the other7 as viewed normal to the plane of the roofing or wall sheets, the recess extending substantially parallel to the upper edge of the apron. However, in order to minimise build up of water on the roof above the apron the upper margin and the recess are preferably arranged to slope. In one embodiment the upper edge, and the recess, slope symmetrically in straight lines with respect to a central vertical plane of the seal assembly, and in another embodiment the apron is substantially circular whereby the upper edge of the apron slopes symmetrically as a semi circle. Preferably said marginal portion is provided with two recesses that are vertically spaced apart, both recesses containing mastic in use. The upper or outer recess is preferably an open recess to enable mastic to be trowelled or pointed into the recess in use when the apron has been mounted on the sheet. A suitable mastic for the outer recess is for example ARBOSIL 1090 or 1081 supplied by AdsheadRatcliffe Co. Ltd of Belper. Preferably a pre formed string or strip of mastic is provided in the lower or inner recess, the cross sectional area of the string preferably being greater than that of the recess, but not necessarily of the same cross sectional shape, such that on clamping of the apron to the sheet, such as by screws or blind rivets through the apron, the string of mastic is plastically deformed to effect an additional seal between the apron and the sheet. Such strings of mastic may be of round or square cross section and will usually have a different composition from that of a trowelling mastic. A suitable mastic strip is ARBO sealing strip supplied by AdsheadRatcliffe Co. Ltd. Preferably the apron is provided with suitable fastener holes, which are preferably arranged along opposite sides of said one recess. In order to facilitate the installation of the roof seal assembly around an existing chimney the apron and the upstanding wall may be formed in two parts, one apron part being integral with the adjacent wall part, and the other apron and wall parts being integrally formed. Preferably the joint between the two apron parts extends substantially transversely of the roof slope direction, to define upper and lower apron parts, and the mating edges of the apron parts comprise overlapping portions, the direction of overlap being chosen to resist ingress of water flowing down the apron. Preferably the mating apron edges on each side of the aperture comprise a tongue on the lower apron part that is directed towards the upper apron part and is received within a recess in the upper apron part. The tongue is preferably a snap fit in the recess. The tongue on the lower apron part on each side of the aperture is preferably continuous with a respective similar tongue provided on the respective substantially vertical edge of the lower wall part, and the respective substantially vertical edge of the upper wall part is provided with a recess to receive the wall tongue. When the roof seal assembly is to be used with a cylindrical chimney, the wall is preferably made cylindrical, but the assembly may be used in other circumstances. For example, the wall may be shaped to define a surround for a roof light or for a duct of rectangular cross section. With a chimney it will not usually be necessary to provide the wall with means to seal against the chimney since a chimney will usually be provided with a cowl which can fit over the upper end of the wall of the roof seal assembly However, when the assembly is used to seal a plastics pipe to sheeting the plastics pipe may be solvent welded to the upstanding wall, or a pipe sleeve may be welded in position within the bore defined by the wall, the sleeve being provided internally with resilient seals to seal with the pipe. It is desirable to avoid the formation of a dam of water behind the upstanding wall, which would be produced if a pair of ridges on the apron, which accommodate adjaces ridges on a roofing sheet, were to be allowed to merge with the wall. In situations where the chimney or duct is of small transverse dimensions it will often be possible to cut the hole in the roofing sheet on the centre line of a ridge of the sheet, so that only one ridge meets with the upstanding wall. For larger chimneys it is preferred to provide the apron with a gutter defined between the ends of the ridges in the roofing sheets and the portion of the upstanding wall which faces upwardly of the roof slope, the hole in the roofing sheet being made sufficiently large to accommodate the gutter. A second aspect of the invention is concerned with the problem of how to seal a roof ridge assembly to roofing sheets on either side of a ridge against water driven up the roofing sheets by wind. According to the second aspect of the invention a ridge assembly for a roof comprises a pair of aprons of which at least the longitudinal margins are adapted to seat against roofing sheets respectively on either side of a ridge, and said margins are provided on their undersides with at least one elongate recess containing a mastic for effecting a seal between the ridge assembly and the respective sheet. The ridge assembly may simply be a ridge cap in the form of a V section member, the two limbs of theV providing the pair of aprons. However, the ridge assembly could be a ventilator assembly, which may be a single unit positioned on the ridge or which may extend continuously along the ridge. The invention will now be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a roof seal assembly for a chimney and mounted on a sloping roof Figure 2 is a section on the line 2 2 of Figure 1 Figure 3 is an enlarged view corresponding to the right hand portion of the apron of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a section on the line 4 4 of Figure 1 and on a larger scale Figures 5 and 6 are views similar to Figures 1 and 2 respectively but of a modification for use on a wall sheet Figure 7a is a view of a further roof seal assembly mounted on a sloping roof and looking in the direction normal to the plane of the roofing sheets Figure 7b is a transverse section of a roofing sheet of the roof shown in Figure 7a Figure 8 is a vertical section on the line 8 8 of Figure 7a Figures 9 and 10 show modified sections similar to Figure 3, of the upper marginal portion of an apron Figure 11 is a view normal to the plane of the roofing sheet of another roof seal assembly Figure 12 is a plan view of a roof seal assembly shown seating a roof light assembly to a sloping roof, the roof light itself being omitted Figure 13 is a vertical .section on the line 13 13 of Figures 12 Figure 14 is a vertical cross section of a ridge cap mounted on a roof ridge and Figure 15 is a plan view of the ridge cap and roof of Figure 14. With reference to Figures 1 to 4, a sloping metal roof comprises sheets 1, only one shown, which are corrugated to provide transversely spaced upstanding ridges 2 which extend in the direction of the roof slope.A circular hole 3 has been cut in the sheet 1, symmetrically positioned with respect to an adjacent pair of the ridges 2 to receive a chimney. The roof seal assembly comprises upper and lower moulded plastics apron parts 4, 5 respectively which are formed integrally with respective upstanding wall parts 6 and 7 which are both substantially semi circular in plan. The apron parts 4, 5 are of substantially uniform thickness for most of their area and are shaped to fit snugly against the upper surface of the sheet 1. The right and left upper edge portions 7, 8 respectively of the lower apron part 5 are provided with respective tongues 9, 10 directed towards the upper apron part 5 and are received as a snap engagement within respective recesses 13, 14 provided in the lower edge portions 11, 12 of the upper apron part 4. As shown inFigure 4 the recess, 13 in this case, is defined between a skirt 15 directed downwardly of the roof slope and a short parallel flange 16. The manner in which skirt 15 overlaps the tongue 9 ensures that water running from lower apron part 5 does not tend to enter the joint. The tongue 9 at the junction of apron part 5 with wall part 7 sweeps upwardly, togther with the recess 13, so that an additional length of tongue 9 is provided on the vertical edge of wall part 7, and is received within a corresponding additional length of recess 13 provided in the opposing vertical edge of wall part 6, to effect a snap connection between the wall parts 6 and 7.Similarly, tongue 10 and recess 14 are continued up the other opposed vertical edges of wall parts 6 and 7. The continuation of the skirts 15 up the vertical joints between the wall parts 6, 7 resists any ingress of water where the junctions between the apron parts 47 5 meet the wall parts 6, 7 In order to seal the upper margin 16 of the upper apron part 4 to the roof sheet 1 against water running down the roof sheet, the apron part 4 is provided with first and second parallel transverse recesses 17, 18, the recess 17 being of semi circular shape in cross section and the recess 18 opening upwardly of the roof slope, as shown in Figure 3. A pre formed extruded length of plastically deformable mastic material is provided in recess 17 and of sufficient volume to project from recess 17. Since the upper margin 16 of the upper apron part 4 is profiled to fit the sheet 1, the length of mastic will follow the sheet profile, and on clamping of the apron parts 4, 5 to the roof 1 by suitable screws passing through an array of pre formed holes 19 in the parts 4, 5 the mastic in recess 17 is compressed against the roof sheet 1 to form a continuous sealing line extending across the full width of apron part 4, from one side to the other. The holes 19 are not shown in Figure 1, but there would be an array of holes over the area of the apron parts 4 and 5 including in particular two lines of holes extending along each side of the recess 17. The recess 18 is then filled with a mastic such asARBOSIL 1090 or 1081 by trowelling to provide a further continous sealing line. It will be appreciated that in this embodiment the mastic in recess 17 provides a reserve seal in the event that the seal of mastic in recess 18 should fail. Although it might be possible to employ a pre formed length of mastic in recess 18, it is preferred to trowel the mastic since this will deal with any local indentations in the roof sheet. Since the recess 18 is an open recess, the mastic in that recess could be replaced after prolonged use if necessary. The screws are sealed in any convenient manner such as by using neoprene washers. Although it might be possible to dispense with the recess 18 and rely entirely on the seal provided by the mastic in recess 17, it is preferred to have two sealing lines as shown. Figures 5 and 6 show a modified construction, primarily intended for use with wall sheets, in which the apron parts 4 and 5 are much narrower than those of the construction of Figure 1 and in which the walls 6, 7 form a cylindrical spigot extending perpendicularly to the plane of apron parts 4, 5. Corresponding reference numerals have been applied to parts corresponding to those cf the Figure 1 construction. An adaptor plate for a smaller chimney may be mounted in the outer part of the spigot in abutment with rib 23. The roof seal assembly of Figures 7 and 8 is a one piece structure and so will have a smaller field of application than the two piece assembly of Figures 1 to 4. It does, however, incorporate certain improvements over that arrangement. In Figures 7 and 8 parts corresponding to those of Figures 1 to 3 have been given corresponding reference numerals. In this case the hole 3 is for convenience centred on one of the roofing sheet ridges 2, and the hole 3 has been made substantially larger than the diameter of the one piece tubular spigot 6 in order to accommodate a circular gutter 24 provided in the apron 4, 5. The base of the gutter 24 is coplanar with the adjacent portions 25 of the apron 4, 5 which lie against the roofing sheet troughs 2 . It will be seen from Figure 7 that the formation of the hole 3 results in cutting back the ridges 2, and the apron 4, 5 is shaped accordingly.Thus, it will be seen from Figure 8 that the apron 4, 5 incorporates st6p end portions 26 to enclose the end 27 of the central ridge 2, and arcuate wall portions 28 fit the cut away portions of the adjacent ridges 2. The gutter 24 ensures that there is a minimum of build up of water on the roof above the apron 4 since it provides a good drainage path around spigot 6 for water running down the roof in troughs 2 . The circular outline of the apron 4, 5 of the embodiment of Figures 7 and 8 assists in minimising build up of water adjacent to the seal in recess 18 since the recess 18 slopes at all positions on the upper margin 16 where its faces upwardly of the slope in the troughs 2 . The recess 18 extends through slightly more than a semi circle to provide an adequate primary seal by the trowelled mastic in that recess 18. A further improvement in this embodiment is that the spigot 6 is completely surrounded by the secondary recess 17 with its mastic strip, thereby ensuring that any water blow up the roof slope cannot enter hole 3. The holes for securing screws have not been shown inFigures 7 and 8 but are arranged in two circles concentric with recess 17, one of smaller diameter and the other of larger diameter. Figure 9 shows a suitable section of apron to be formed by a vacuum moulding process, and Figure 10 shows another section suitable for injection moulding. InFigure 10 a series of three small parallel recesses 17 are shown, and these represent an alternative arrangement, the main recess 17 not being provided when the recesses 17 are provided. The recesses 17 would be filled with mastic strings. Figures 9 and 10 show how the mastic provided in recess 17 has spread on tightening of the apron portion 16 onto the roofing sheet 1, due to the fact that the cross sectional area of the strip provided in recess 17 was greater than the cross sectional area of the recess 17. A metal or plastics cover bead may be provided to cover the mastic in recess 18, to protect it against damage, the bead being secured by screws or other suitable fasteners. Figure 11 shows a further embodiment in the form of a seal assembly for a small chimney in a sloping roof.The outline of the apron 4, 5 defines sloping edges 29 to minimise build up of water on the roof above apron 4, 5.As with the embodiment of Figures 7 and 8, the recess 17 surrounds the hole 13. Figures 12 and 13 show a seal assembly for a roof light 32 in a sloping roof. The roof light shown by way of example is a Crittall Ventura type A. Parts of the seal assembly corresponding to those of the previousFigures have been given corresponding reference numerals.A timber roof light kerb 30 is received snugly within the upstanding wall 6 of rectangular shape, as viewed normal to the apron 4, 5, and is supported on suitable conventional roof supporting members 31. In suitable cases the kerb 30 may form a structural part of the roof.The arrangement of the sealing lines 17, 18 is similar to the seal assembly of Figure 1, but as with the construction of Figures 7 and 8 a gutter 24 is provided along the upper side of wall 6, and a further gutter 24tut along the lower side of wall 6, in order to reduce the build up of water in channels 2 above the wall 6. In a modification, not shown, of the seal assembly of Figures 12, the upper margin of the apron 4, 5 is sloped in the manner of the sides 2a in Figure 11, although the angle of slope may not be as great as inFigure 11. Another modification of the assembly of Figure 12 would be to extend the recess 17 completely around the wall 6, in the manner of Figures 7 and 11. With reference to Figure 14 and 15, a moulded plastics ridge cap 32 is sealed to the corrugated steel sheets 33, 34 of a roof in a manner analogous to that employed in the construction of Figure 1. The cap 32 is of substantially Section, but the two walls 35, 36 are shaped to conform to the corrugations of the sheets 33, 34, which of course must be suitably aligned during construction of the roof. The lower margins of the walls 35, 36 are each provided with recesses 37, 38 extending parallel to the ridge 39 in which mastic material is positioned in an identical manner to that of the recesses 17, 18 respectively of the Figure 1 construction, except of course that in this case the recess 38 corresponding to recess 18 is lower down the roof slope than recess 37 corresponding to recess 17. Recesses 37 contain a mastic strip, and recesses 38 are pointed with a suitable mastic. Since the cap 32 follows the contours of the sheets 33, 34, and since a double line of mastic seals each wall 35, 36 to the roof, an effective seal is provided against blown water. Again, the cap 32 is screwed to the sheets 33, 34, by lines of screws on either side of each recess 37. It may be desirable for the ridge cap to be formed of glass fibre reinforced plastics for strength, and it may be made thicker than will generally be desirable for the roof seal assemblies previously described, since it is desirable for the roof seal assembly to have a minimum thickness so as not substantially to inhibit water flow. Joints between adjacent lengths of ridge cap may be simple lap and caulk, or a snap fit.
