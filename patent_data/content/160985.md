## Description
The present invention relates to a method and a device for determining whether a pre edged lens canbe edged to be fitted to a spectacle frame and for edging a lens. More specifically, thepresent invention pertains to a method and a device which judges whether or not the pre edged lens can beedged for having it fitted to a spectacle frame before the lens is edged. Before a lens is edged, a judgment must be made as to whether or not the peripheral configuration ofthe edged lens will conform to the shape of the spectacle frame. In fitting a spectacle lens to a frame,consideration must be made that the spectacle lens be positioned in the spectacle frame so that the axis ofthe spectacle lens will coincide with the corresponding eye of the wearer. Generally, this means that thecenter of the spectacle lens be eccentrically positioned with regard to the geometric center of the spectacleframe. The center of the spectacle lens must be further eccentrically placed with regard to the geometriccenter of the spectacle frame in order to correct squint by a prism function of the spectacle lens. Conventionally, the aforementioned judgment is carried out by using a sucker device for pre edgedlenses, such as the Point Setter produced by TOKYO OPTICAL CO., LTD. which is the assignee of thisinvention. The sucker device for pre edged lenses includes a sucker means for sucking the pre edged lensto mount it on the lens edging machine, a target plate having a plurality of concentric circles, and aneccentricity scale extending from the center of the different concentric circles. The concentric circlesindicate configurations of different pre edged lenses. In the sucker device a template provided by copyingthe spectacle frame is located on the target plate so that the center of the template is kept off the center ofthe concentric circles by the predetermined eccentric distance, and judgment is made as to whether or notthe template protrudes from the circles indicating the configuration of the predetermined pre edged lens inorder to judge the usability of the pre edged lens for making a lens to be used in the spectacle frame. Thus, in the aforementioned sucker device, it is required to provide such template for each spectacle,and there is no possibility of realizing highly precise judgment since it is difficult to produce precisetemplates and the precision of the eccentric setting of the template is affected by the operator s skill.Further, from the EP A 92364 there is known a method for dimensioning a lens to fit into a spectacle frame. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method and a device for calculating therelationship between the pre edged lens and the spectacle frame and for edging a lens. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and a device for judging whether or notthe pre edged lens can be edged to be fitted to the spectacle frame without preparing a template.

The shafts 18a, 18b have sprocket wheels 74, 75, respectively. Chains 76, 77 link thesprockets 72, 73 with the sprockets 74, 75 respectively, so that the shafts 18b, 18a are rotated by the motor70. In the housing 1, there is further provided a spectacle frame holding means 90, a station 91 of which islocated parallel to the longitudinal direction of the arm member 16 at the time the carriage 13 is at the firstposition. The station 91 has a pair of rails 92, 93 parallel to the longitudinal direction of the arm member 16,which movably support spectacle frame supporting members 94, 95. The supporting members 94, 95 areconstantly biased toward each other by a spring 96. The supporting member 95 has a screw portion at itsleg portion 95a, which engages with a transfer screw 97a provided on the shaft of a Y axis motor 97. Thesupporting members 94, 95 have fitting members 94c, 95c at the upper portions 94b, 95b of arms 94, 95 inorder to fit a spectacle frame holding member 100. As shown in Figure 2B, the holding member 100 has a base plate 101 with a circular opening 102 at itscenter, spectacle frame holding arms 103, 104 provided on the plate 101 being opposite to each other, anda pressure member 105 for pressing a spectacle frame 200. The arms 103, 104 hold upper and lower limbs of the spectacle frame 200 and the pressure member105 presses the lens frame 200, so that the spectacle frame 200 is secured over the opening 102 of themember 100. At this time, a fore end 105a and a rear end 105b of the pressure member 105 are projectedfrom concavities 103a, 104a of the arms 103, 104, whereby a fore end 101a and a rear end 101b notshown in Figures of the plate 101 are on the same plane with the ends 105a, 105b, respectively. Themember 100 holding the spectacle frame 200 is supported by the supporting members 94c, 95c. The base plate 101, the pressure member 105 and the concavities 103a, 104a are designed so that theupper edge of the rear end 106b and the lower edge of the rear end 101b are positioned at the samedistance d from the center axis of a V shaped groove of the lower limb of the spectacle frame 200. Thesupporting members 94c, 95c have V shaped grooves 94d, 95d, respectively. As a result, as shown inFigure 2C, when the holding member 100 is supported by the supporting members 94c, 95c, the upperedge of the rear end 105b and the lower edge of the rear end 101b slide on surfaces of the V shapedgrooves 94d, 95d so that the center between the upper edge and the lower edge becomes coincident withthe center 201b of the V shaped groove 94d, 95d. In this way the center of a V shaped groove of the lowerlimb coincides with the one of the supporting members 94c, 95c. A template holding device 110, as shown in Figure 4, is used in the case where a lens template 210 issupported by the supporting members 94, 95. The device 110 comprises a holding frame 111, polemembers 112, 113 secured on opposite ends of the holding frame 111, a template holding pole 111a fixedto the frame 111 at its center, and pins 114, 115, 116 projected from the template holding pole 111a at itsend. The template 210 has three holes to be engaged with the pins 114, 115, 116. Hereinafter, the operation of the spectacle frame measuring means described above is explained. Thespectacle frame holding member 100 is held by the supporting members 94, 95, and the carriage 13 ismoved by rotation of the Z axis motor 40 in the direction of the arrow A shown in Figure 1 by a predetermined displacement. In accordance with the rotation of the Y axis motor 97, the spectacle handlingmember 100 is moved along the rails 92, 93 by the predetermined displacement and the spectacle frame200 is moved to the first set position so that the center 201b of the V shaped groove of the lower limb isbrought in contact with the contacting wheel 546 in same plane, and the rotation axis 0 When the carriage 13 and the detecting arm 51 are located at the first position as shown in Figure 2Aand the detector 54 is located at the first position as shown in Figure 5 where the detector 54 is pressed bythe spring 59 so as not to abut on the spectacle frame 200, an origin O is taken to be on the axis 0 When the detecting arm 51 is positioned at the standard position or In this way digital radius vector values œÅ The values œÅ From the spectacle frame data x Then, differences Œî The operation mentioned above makes the rotation center 0 Referring to Figure 7, there is shown a method for measuring the spectacle template which is usedinstead of the spectacle frame. In Figure 7 elements corresponding to those shown in Figure 5 are assignedthe same reference numerals and explanation thereof is omitted. To measure the configuration of thespectacle template 210, the feeler 544 is moved in contact with the periphery of the spectacle template 210and the detecting arm 51 is rotated. The detecting arm 51 is shifted from the origin O by the predetermineddistance to locate the rotation axis 0 While, in the case where the detecting arm 51 is positioned at the first standard position, the radiusvector t By the same method as that mentioned above for measuring the spectacle frame, the geometric centerof the spectacle template 210 is calculated from the radius vector values tœÅ In this embodiment a contact point 546a between the groove of the spectacle frame 200 and thecontacting wheel 546 or the contacting surface 544a, as shown in Figure 3, is adapted to be located on theaxis 0, of the shaft 543, at the measuring time when the contacting wheel 546 and the feeler 544 supportedby the U shaped arm member 545 are pressed against the groove of the spectacle frame or the template,and the member 545 is turned to lie along a line perpendicular to the contact surface between the wheel546 and the groove or the feeler 544 and the template. Consequently, the measurement mentioned above isalways carried out with precision. Referring to Figures 8 through 13 there is illustrated the lens measuring means 30 shown in Figure 1.Shafts 302, 303 are fixed on a base 301 normally projected from the arm portion 31 and pivot link arms304, 305 at their ends, respectively. Arm members 309, 310 are mounted on the ends of a link bar 306 andpivoted on the link arms 304, 305 at their other ends through shafts 307, 308, respectively, so that the linkarms 304, 305, the link bar 306 and the base 301 form a link mechanism. The arm members 309, 310 have shafts 311, 312 lying parallel to the link bar 306 through deformedelliptical frames 317, 318. Other deformed elliptical frames 313, 314 pivot the shafts 311, 312 at their ends,respectively. A U shaped arm portion 315a of a shaft member 315 is movably engaged with the shaft 311 atits middle portion and the shaft member 315 is movably engaged with a bearing portion 316a of a movingmember 316. The moving member 316 has a pin 319 on its upper surface which is movably engaged with aslit 320a of an arm member 320. The arm member 320 is pivoted by a shaft 321 projected from the base301 at its end. In the same way, a U shaped arm portion 322a of a shaft member 322 is movably engagedwith the shaft 312 at its middle portion and the shaft member 322 is movably engaged with a bearingportion 323a of a moving member 323. The moving member 323 has a pin 319 on its upper surface which is movably engaged with a slit 325a of an arm member 325. The arm member 325 is pivoted by a shaft 326projected from the base 301 at its end. On the base 301 is mounted an arm motor 330, the rotation shaft of which is provided with an arm plate331. The arm plate 331 has rotary wheels 332, 333 at its opposite ends, which are pressed onto the sidesof the arm members 320, 325. On the middle portion of the arm member 320 is mounted a detecting head335 of an encoder 334, and a scale 337 of the encoder 334 passes through the detecting head 335. Thebase 301 pivots a scale 337 at its end. In the same way, a detecting head 339 is mounted on the armmember 325 at its middle portion, and a scale 340 of the encoder 334 passes through the detecting head339. Two rail members 341, 342 passing through frames 313, 314 are supported by frames 317, 318 parallelto the link bar 306 so as to support the frames 313, 314. The frame 313 is engaged with a cylindricmember 345 at the end thereof into which a cylindric member 343 is rotationary inserted on a common axisthereof. The U shaped arm portion 315a of the shaft member 315 is movably engaged with a groove 343aformed on the periphery of the cylindric member 343. In the same way, the frame 314 is engaged with acylindric member 345 at the end thereof into which a cylindric member 346 is rotationally inserted on acommon axis thereof. The U shaped arm portion 322a of the shaft member 322 is movably engaged with agroove 346a formed on the outer periphery of the cylindric member 343. A ring 347 having a bevel 347a and a ring 348 having a bevel 348 are movably mounted on thecylindric member 345. The cylindric member 345 has a groove 345a parallel to the axis thereof, and a pin349 connects the ring 347 with the cylindric member 343 and a pin 350 connects the ring 348 with thecylindric member 346. As shown in Figure 10, pins 351, 352 pulled by a spring 353 penetrate the cylindricmembers 343, 346, whereby the cylindric members 343, 346 are pulled toward each other and the rings347, 348 linked to the cylindric members 343, 346 are also pulled toward each other. The carriage 13, as shown Figure 13, has a linear encoder 610 for measuring displacement of thecarriage 13, a scale 611 provided on the side of the arm portion 31 of the lens measuring means 30 so asto be rotated about a pivotal point P, and a detector head 612 pivoted on the side of the carriage 13. Figures 13 throuth 18B show the operations of the lens measuring means described above. In Figure 13the carriage 13 is returned to the first position so that the edged lens LE is brought to the predeterminedposition. Subsequently, an eccentric cam 360 is rotated by a driving means not shown in the Figure sothat the lens measuring means is turned about the shaft 12 to make the cylindric member 345 contact withthe periphery of the edged lens LE. Next, the rotary work holder 18 is rotated stepwise by predeterminedangle in the same manner as in edging the lens, and the radius vector œÅ of the edged lens is measured ateach stepped angle. The encoder 610 is utilized for measuring the radius vector œÅ . On the other hand, therotation angle Œ≥ of the arm portion is changed in response to a displacement ‚Ñì The radius R of the pre edged lens measured by the lens measuring means is compared with themaximum radius vector œÅ The above description of judgement is related to a case where the geometric center of the spectacleframe coincides with that of the pre edged lens LE, but the spectacle lens is, in general, eccentrically edgedso that the axis of the spectacle lens fitted in the frame coincides with that of the eye, because the axis ofthe eye generally does not pass through the geometric center of the frame. Therefore, it is necessary thatthe radius R be compared with the eccentric radius vector œÅ Further, if heterophoria is corrected by prismatic function of the spectacle lens, assuming that Pdesignates a predetermined prismatic value and N means the refractive power, eccentric prismatic powerpe can be obtained from the following equation Meanwhile, the total eccentric power e, the eccentric distance ge and the eccentric prismatic value peare divided into ex, ey, gex, gey and pex, pey, respectively ex, gex and pex are x axis components, andey, gey and pey are y axis components , then the equation mentioned above is reduced to the followingequations In order to calculate the relation between the pre edged lens LE and the spectacle frame, including thetotal eccentric values ex and ey, the radius vector values œÅ The coordinate values X Figures 16, 17A and 17B illustrate measurement of the curvature and peripheral thickness of the lensby the lens measuring means 30. The motor 330 is energized to keep the arm plate 331 from pressing thearm members 320, 325, so that the cylindric members 343, 346 are moved toward each other by the spring353. As a result, the periphery of the lens LE is caught between the rings 347, 348 linked with the cylindricmembers 343, 346. At this time the cylindric members 343, 346 cause the arm members 320, 325 to swing,and the rotation angle of the arm members 320, 325 or the displacements of the rings 347, 348 aremeasured by the encoders 334, 338. By energizing the motor 70 the lens LE is rotated stepwise, and thedisplacements of the rings 347, 348 are measured at each rotation angle of the lens LE in order to calculatethe peripheral thicknesses Œî The edging is performed at a selected speed, namely the edging is carried out slowly when theperiphery of the lens is thick such as in a high negative power lens., and rapidly when the periphery is thinsuch as a positive power lens, so that the lens is edged at the best efficiency of the grinding wheel. In the case where the pre edged lens is for astigmatism, the peripheral thickness differs from radiusvector to radius vector, and the direction of radius vector The above measurement of the radius R and the peripheral thickness Œî was explained with reference towhere the pre edged lens LE is supported by the work holding shaft 18 so that the axis of the lens LEcoincides with that of the shaft 18. The peripheral thickness in measured as the same value as where the axis of the lens LE coincideswith that of the shaft 18, even though the axis OL of the lens LE does not coincide with the rotation axis OMof the shaft 18, because, as shown in Figure 17B, spacing between a predetermined standard point and therings 347, 348 changes from ¬µ Similarly, even though the astigmatic lens LE is supported so that the axis OL of the lens LE does notcoincide with the rotation axis OM, the maximum and minimum peripheral thicknesses The radius vector values œÅ Referring now to Figure 19, there is shown a block diagram of a control circuit for the above mentionedlens edging machine. The pulse generator 1202 is connected with motors 40, 42, 70, 97, 330 and 1100 through a motorcontrol circuit 1201, which selectively supplies pulses applied from the pulse generator 102 to the motors tocontrol their rotation angle. The circuit 1201 is connected with a spectacle frame data memory 1207 formemorizing the frame data, means 1208 for memorizing a radius of the pre edged lens, and a peripheralthickness calculating circuit 1210. The encoders 61, 334, 338 and 610 are connected with counters 1203, 1204, 1205 and 1206respectively which count pulses generated by the encodes. The counters 1203, 1204 are connected withthe peripheral thickness calculating circuit 1210 which calculates the peripheral thickness Œî The circuit 1211 is connected with an astigmatic axis detector circuit 1212. The circuit 1212 receivessignals of spherical power S, astigmatic power C and direction angle of astigmatic axis Œ≥ from a pre edgedlens characteristic input means 1223 so as to judge whether the pre edged lens LE has positive power ornegative power. If the lens LE has positive power, the rotation angle The circuit 1210 is connected with the motor control circuit 1201 through an edging speed determiningcircuit 1215. The circuit 1215 determines the edging speed or speed drop of the stopping member 27 inaccordance with the peripheral thickness values The counter 1205 is connected with the spectacle frame data memory 1207 to memorize the count ofthe encoder 61 and the rotation angle of the motor 70 or the radius vector angle as the radius vectorvalues œÅ The means for memorizing a radius of pre edged lens 1208 is connected with the encoder 610 throughthe counter 1206 and with the motor control circuit 1201, and it memorizes the lens radius value R An eccentric distance input means 1217 and an eccentric prismatic value input means 1218 areconnected with the circuit 1213 through an addition circuit 1216, so that the signal of the total eccentricvalue e with the addition of the eccentric distance ge to the eccentric prism power pe is applied to thecircuit 1213. An astigmatic axis setting angle input means 1220 is connected with the circuit 1213 to inputan astigmatic axis setting angle Œ≥ to the circuit 1213. The input means 1223, 1217, 1218 and 1219 may beincluded in a keyboard input means 1220 such as a numerical keypad. The calculation and judgment circuit 1213 consists of a microcomputer to perform the calculation andthe judgment mentioned above, with reference to Figures 13 through 18. The circuit 1213 is connected withdisplay means 1221 such as a liquid crystal display apparatus and talking means 1222 to inform theoperator of the judgment as to whether or not the pre edged lens LE can be edged to fit the spectacleframe.
