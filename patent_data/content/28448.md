# FLUID MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
A fluid motor control system 11 is designed to ensure that automatic changes of motor displacement, which are initiated by occurrence of a predetermined operational condi tion in the system 11 , result in a change of motor speed of the desired magnitude. Flow adjustment elements 76 respond to a displacement increase by reducing the flow of working fluid available to the motor or motors 12, 13 and respond to a motor displacement reduction by increasing the available flow. In one specific form, the system 11 controls a pair of right and left side vehicle drive motors 12, 13 and provides for automatic reduction of the fluid flow supplied to the motors 12, 13 on increase of the motor displacements to reduce travel speed during turning.
