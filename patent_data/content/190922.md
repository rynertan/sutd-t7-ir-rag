# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE ORIENTATION OF AXES OF BIREFRINGENCE IN AN OPTICAL FIBER

## Abstract
An apparauts and process for accurate alignament of the birefrigent axes of circular fibers, and differentiation be tween the fast and slow axes utilizing an externally induced stress birefringence to change the orientation and magni tude of the natural fiber birefringence at a selected point along the length of the fiber 24 is disclosed. The apparatus comprises a light source 60 for supplying polarized light to the fiber 24 , means 66, 68 for inducing stress to the fiber at that point in a variable direction and means 78 for monitoring the effect on the light as that direction is varied. A measurement of coupling from one polarization mode of the fiber to the othe as the axis of induced stress is changed provides an accurate determination of the lacation of the birefringent axes of the fiber 24 .
