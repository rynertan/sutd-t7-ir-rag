# Apparatus for winding metal strip.

## Abstract
A coiler for metal strip is decribed which has a coiler mandrel 1, wrapper rolls 2, 3 and 4 spaced about the mandrel 1 for guiding the initial wraps of a coil about the mandrel 1, and hyaraulic rams 5, 6 and 7 for each of the wrapper rolls for urging the respective roll into engagement with the strip and for displacing that roll outwardly. Each wrapper roll has a sensor associated with that wrapper roll which gives a sensor signal on the passage of the leading end of a strip past a given location. A control circuit for the associated wrapper roll receives the sensor signal and immediately operates the associated hydraulic ram of that wrapper roll in advance of said given location to displace that wrapper roll away from the mandrel.
