# TONE DETECTOR WITH PSEUDO PHASE LOCKED LOOP

## Abstract
The tone detector provides accurate detection of a single predetermined tone frequency within a mixture of frequencies, utilizing a carrier signal source at a relatively high frequency. The high frequency signal is divided down to two frequencies, one just above and one just below the tone. The divider output is then maintained at the frequency of the tone by continuously adjusting the divisor number between the two divisor values. Multiplying the received signal or a portion thereof by the divider output provides a detect signal when the tone is present in the received signal with sufficient amplitude.
