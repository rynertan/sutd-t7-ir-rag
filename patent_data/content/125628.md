# RESIN INTERFACE DETECTION SYSTEM

## Abstract
An improved method and system that utilizes conduc tance values of cationic and anionic exchange resins clas sified as layers of a mixed resin bed to automatically detect interfaces between the layers is disclosed. The arrangement includes electrical circuitry which initially samples the con ductivity of a passing resin slurry. The initial conductivity value is compared to subsequent conductivity values of the passing slurry and the flow of the passing slurry is automati cally terminated when the subsequent conductivity value is a certain fraction of the initial conductivity value. Termination in response to this equality condition effectively detects the interface between classified layers of a mixed resin bed.
