# Axial sealing mechanism for a scroll compressor.

## Abstract
A scroll type fluid displacement compressor includes a housing 12 , a pair of scrolls 13, 14 each comprising an end plate 131, 141 and scroll element 132, 142 projecting from one surface of the respective end plate. Both scroll elements are interfitted at an angular and radial offset to make a plurality of line contacts. A groove 134, 144 is formed on the end surface of each scroll element and a seal element 22, 23 is placed within each groove. The axial thickness of one seal element 22 is equal to the other seal element 23 is less than the distance between the bottom surface of the other groove and the end plate of the opposing scroll. Thus, one seal element is fixed in the axial direction and the other seal element is movable in the axial direction to effect a proper axial sealing of the scrolls while making it possible to more easily manufacture and assemble the scroll compressor.
