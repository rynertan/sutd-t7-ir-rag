# Method of reducing the reflectance of a transparent viewing screen and viewing screen with reduced reflectance.

## Abstract
A viewing screen is described, in particular the screen of a display tube, which has excellent antireflective properties and a method of making this screen anti reflective. Firstly the outer surface of the screen is mechanically roughened in conformity with specific requirements and subsequently an anti reflective coating of constant thickness is applied to the roughened surface.
