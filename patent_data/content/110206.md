# Delayed restraint release device for inflatable escape slides.

## Abstract
A strap restrains full extension of an evacuation slide until a bag 70 on the slide inflates to extend and unlace a cord 62 to separate the strap coupling the restrained seg ments of the slide. The device is especially useful as a back up restraint in escape slides of the dual chamber variety wherein the inflation of one but not the other of the cham bers will not create sufficient pressure to break a primary restraint device 54 employing shear pins separable by a predetermined pressure being attained in the inflatable slide chambers.
