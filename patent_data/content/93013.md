# Method of withdrawing particulate material from dead bed of centrifugal crusher and centrifugal crusher suitable for carrying the method into practice.

## Abstract
In a centrifugal crusher including a rotor 2, 11 rotating at high speed for receiving a supply of material to be crushed, and a crushing chamber 3, 12 enclosing the rotor, the material is thrown out of the rotor in a tangential direction by centrifugal forces into collision with a dead bed 4, 13 constituted by particulate material stacked in a heap in the crushing chamber after being produced by crushing the material. The particulate material brought into collision with the dead bed is allowed to stay in the crushing chamber for a period of time long enough to serve as a dead bed for crushing the particulate material into particles of a desired particle size, before being discharged continuously or periodically from the crushing chamber.
