## Description
TUBE BUNDLE ASSEMBLY AND PROCESS FOR ITS CONSTRUCTIONThe present invention relates generally to heat exchangers and to methods of heat exchanger construction.Heat transfer is an important part of any process. As is well known, an indirect transfer of heat from one medium to another is usually accomplished by the use of heat exchangers of which there are many types. For example, there are double pipe, shell and tube, plate heat exchangers and others. Indeed, the art of heat exchanger design is developed to a very high degree. However, there is still room for improvement in a number of areas, such as reducing pressure drop, increasing overall heat transfer coefficients, reducing fouling, and in heat exchangers utilizing a tube bundle, such as the shell and tube heat exchangers, improving the tube support and ease of assembly. In many instances, the tubes in a shell and tube heat exchanger prematurely fail because the tubes vibrate or rub against one another or other parts of the heat exchanger such as for example, a baffle or the shell.The art has heretofore recognized the need for tube support. Plate type baffles have been used in heat exchangers for many years. Such baffles provide support for the tubes at least to some degree. The double segmental plate baffle heat exchanger is well known to those skilled in the art, and although heat exchangers using plate type baffles were a relatively early development in heat exchanger design, such exchangers are still widely used today. In most plate type baffle heat exchangers the passages in the plate baffles through which the tubes pass are slightly larger in diameter than the outside diameter of the tubes in order to facilitate construction of the exchanger, and, as a result, vibration of the tubes can and does often occur, which frequently results in premature tube failure. It is desirable to be able to assemble o beat exchanger without having zero clearance between tube supporting baffle rods or bars and the tubes while the tubes are being installed between the rods and into the tube sheet.Due to manufacturing variances, the rods and tubes are sometimes slightly larger or smaller than specified. Duc to such dimensional variations, by the time several rows of tubes have been installed through the baffle rods, the tubes do not match the corresponding apertures in the tube sheet and are so tight in the rod baffle structures that damage can be done to the tubes during the assembly procedure. If, however, the outer diameters of either or both the tubes and the rods are designed with slightly smaller dimensions to facilitate the complete assembly of the tube bundle, then the tubes will not be tight in the baffles and will be subJect to vibration induced wear during operation which can result in tube damage and premature failure of the heat exchanger. In accordance with the present invention I have discovered that an improved heat exchanger structure is provided by utilizing at least one baffle support in the tube bundle intermediate the opposite ends of the tubes which permits loose passage of the tubes therethrough during assembly of the tube bundle and subsequently pernits firm engagement of these tubes when the tubes are properly positioned. More specifically, one aspect of the present invention provides method for assembling the tube bundle of a heat exchanger wherein at least one outer ring, carrying a first plurality of substantially parallel rods and a second plurality of substantially parallel rods inclined at an angle to the first plurality of rods, receives a plurality of tubes loosely therethrough in a first position of the rods and, in a second position of the rods, provides firm engagement of the tubes by the rods thereby providing simplified tube bundle construction and firm engagement of the tubes intermediate their opposite ends. In another aspect of the present invention, novel apparatus is provided for the tube bundle of a heat exchanger comprising a plurality of tubes with at least one outer ring encircling the tubes interuiediate their ends. At least one of the outer rings carries a plurality of rods each having opposite ends and positioned in a space between adjacent tube rows, each rod having at least one first region of reduced thickness on the surface thereof for allowing movement of adjacent tubes therepast in a first position thereof and having at least one second region of increased thickness on the surface thereof adjacent the first region for firmly engaging adjacent tubes in a second position of the rod to prevent movement of the tubes. Means are also provided for securing each of the rods to the outer ring in its second position. An object of the present invention is to provide improved support for tubeh of a tube bundle. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of assembly of the support rods in a tube bundle of a heat exchanger. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide improved reliability in a shell and tube heat exchanger. Still another object of the present invention is to facilitate the construction of heat exchangers. Other objects, aspects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upoa reference to the present specification and accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a side elevation view of a heat exchanger employing a tube bundle constructed in accordance with the present invention with portions of the shell broken away to more clearly illustrate the internal construction thereof FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view taken along line 2 2 of FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view taken along line 3 3 of FIG. 1 FIG. 4 is sn enlarged partial view of the tube bundle structure ofFIG. 3 and illustrates the relative positions of the Outer ring, baffle rods and tubes with the tubes loosely disposed between the rods FIG. 5 is an enlarged partial view of the tube bundle structure, similar to FIG. 4, and illustrates the relative positions of the outer ring, baffle rods and tubes with the baffle rods moved to their second positions securely engaging the tubes, with the initial positions of the baffle rods and tubes indicated by dashed lines FIG. 6 is a partial side elevation view of one form of baffle rod conStructed in accordance with the present invention and having a substantially rectangular cross section FIG. 7 is a cross sectional view taken along line 7 7 of FIG. 6. FIG. 8 is a partial side elevation view of another form of baffle rod constructed in accordance with the present invention and having a substantially circular cross section FIG. 9 is a cross sectional view taken along line 9 9 of FIG. 8 FIG. 10 is a partial side elevation view of another form of baffle rod constructed in accordance with the present invention and having a substantially circular cross section FIG. 11 is an enlarged cross sectional detail view illustrating one form of securement between a baffle rod and an outer ring PIG. 12 is an enlarged elevation detail view illustrating another form of securement between a baffle rod and an outer ring FIG. 13 is an enlarged cross sectional detail view illustrating a form of bolted securement between baffle rods and an outer ring and FIG. 14 is an enlarged detail view taken along line 14 14 of FIG. 13. Referring now to the drawings, and to FIG. 1 in particular, a single pass shell and tube heat exchanger, generally designated by the reference character 10, is illustrated therein. The heat exchanger 10 comprises a shell 12 and a tube bundle 14 positioned therein. The tube bundle 14 includes a pair of tube sheets 16 and 18 having apertures formed therein through which the opposite ends of a plurality of tubes 20 extend. The opposite ends of the tubes are secured to the respective tube sheets to provide support for the plurality of parallel aligned tubes 20. A pair of baffles 22 and a second pair of baffles 24 are positioned alternately along the longitudinal axes of the parallel tubes 20 in spaced relation and provide support for the tubes intermediate the tube sheets 16 and 18. While the baffles 22 and 24 are shown lying in a plane normal to the longitudinal exis of the tubes 20 of the tube bundle 14, it is possible to use baffles which are not in planes perpendicular or normal to the longitudinal axis of the tube bundle, however, baffles lying in perpendicular or normal planes as shown are more easily and economically constructed and are thus preferred. Nozzles 26 and 28 communicate with the respective opposite ends of the tube side of the heat exchanger 10 providing means for passing a first fluid through the tubes. Nozzles 30 and 32 communicate with the respective ends of the shell side of the heat exchanger 10 and provide means for passing a second fluid over the outside surfaces of the tubes when preferably using countercurrent flow of the heat exchange fluids or mediums. The tubes 20 in the heat exchanger 10 are laid out in a square pitch, and generally a square pitch tube layout provides greater surface area for a given shell diameter for an apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention. This layout of the tubes 20 is best illustrated in FIGS 2 and 3. It will be seen that the tubes 20 thus laid out form a plurality of vertically spaced horizontal tube rows and a plurality of horizontally spaced vertical tube rows. The baffles 22 illustrated in FIG. 2 comprise a baffle or supporting ring 34 encircling the tubes 20. A plurality of horizontally extending baffle rod. or bars 36 are fixedly secured at their opposite ends in the supporting ring 34 and extend between alternate pairs of horizontal parallel tube rows.A plurality of vertically extending baffle rods or bars 38 are fixedly secured at their opposite ends in the supporting outer ring 34 and extend between alternate pairs of vertical parallel tube rows. The opposite ends of the rods 36 and 38 may be suitably secured to the outer ring 34 by welding as shown in either FIG. 11 or FIG. 12, or may be bolted thereto as illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14. The construction of the baffle 24 is illustrated in FIG. 3. The baffle 24 comprises an outer supporting baffle ring 40 which encircles the tubes 20 in a manner similar to that described for the ring 34. A plurality of horizontally extending baffle rods or bars 42 are movably secured at their opposite ends in the outer ring 40 and extend between alternate pairs of horizontal parallel tube rows. It will be noted, however, that the tube rows between which the rods 42 extend are not the tube rows between which the rods 36 of the baffle 22 extend. The rods 42 are positioned between horizontal tube rows which are open or unbaffled in the baffle 22. Similarly, the baffle 24 includes a plurality of vertically extending baffle rods or bars 44 movably secured at their opposite ends in the supporting outer ring 40 which rods extend between alternate pairs of vertical parallel tube rows.The rods 44 are not positioned between the same vertical tube rows through which the baffle rods 38 of the baffle 22 extend, but rather extend between adjacent vertical tube rows which are open in the baffle 22. The rods 36 and 38 of the baffles 22 are of such thickness or diameter as to be closely received between the tubes of the adjacent horizontal and vertical tube rows, respectively. As best shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, the opposite ends of the rods 42 and 44 are slideably received within corresponding apertures 46 and 48 extending through the outer ring 40. Each of the rods 42 and 44 includes a plurality of first regions of reduced thickness 50 spaced along the length of the respective rod in correspondence to the center to center distance between the tubes 20 of adjacent tube rows. The regions of reduced thickness 50 say be circular in cross section as illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5 and as further illustrated in FIG. 10, or otherwise shaped.Each region of reduced thickness 50 is preferably approximately 1 16 inch 1.5875 mm less in thickness than the space between adjacent tubes in the tube row separated by the baffle rod. The baffle rods 42 and 44 further include second regions of increased thickness 52 disposed adjacent the first regions of reduced thickness 50. These regions of increased thickness 52 may be of either circular or rectangular cross section. The thickness of the second regions of increased thickness 52 are preferably slightly greater than the nominal distance between adjacent tubes of the tube rows separated by the respective baffle rods. FIG. 10 illustrates an enlarged portion of a baffle rod or bar 42 illustrating the region of reduced thickness 50 and the region of increased thickness 52 thereon. The rod illustrated in FIG. 10 is preferably circular in cross section throughout its entire length. The first region of reduced thickness 50 is arcuately shaped along the longitudinal axis of the rod, and conforms generally to the configuration of the outer surface of the tubes 20. It will be noted that the arcuate shape of the region of reduced thickness 50 provides a third transitional region 54 formed on the surface of the rod extending between the first and second regions 50 and 52 and increasing in circular cross sectional area between the first and second regions. FIGS. 8 and 9 illustrate a slightly modified version of the rod or bar of FIG. 10 which will be designated by the reference character 42a. In the rod 42a, the first regions of reduced thickness 50 and the second regions of increased thickness 52 are of circular cross section as in the rod 42. The third transitional region 54a interconnecting each of the first and second regions 50 and 52 provides a frusto conically shaped surface on the rod 42a increasing in circular cross section from each first region 50 to each corresponding second region 52. This configuration of the third transitional region 54a provides a more gradual transition between each region of reduced thickness and the corresponding region of increased thickness. FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate a third form of baffle rod or bar of substan tially rectangular cross section which is designated by the reference character 42b. The first regions of reduced thickness of the rod 42b are designated by the reference character 50b, and the second regions of increased thickness are designated by the reference character 52b. Teach region of reduced thickness 50b is connected to a corresponding region of increased thickness 52b by a third transitional region 54b formed on the surface of the rod of increasing rectangular cross sectional area from the region of reduced thickness to the region of increased thickness. FIGS. 13 and 14 illustrate the connections of the baffle rod or bar 42b and a similarly constructed vertical baffle rod or bar 44b to a modified outer supporting ring designated by the reference character 40b. The outer ring 40b comprises a central ring member 56 and a pair of external ring members 58 and 60 which cooperate with threaded bolts 62 to fixedly secure the outer ends of the rods 42b and 44b to the outer ring 40b. It should be noted at this point that the rods 36, 38, 42 and 44 can be constructed of round or square tubing material and the regions of reduced thickness 50 between the regions of increased thickness 52 can be advantageously and econosically formed by stamping whereby the regions of reduced thickness FIG. 12 illustrates a modified connection between a baffle rod 44 and the outer ring 40 in which a transverse groove 76 is formed in the outer periphery 72 of the ring 40 intersecting each aperture 46 and 48 in vhich a suitable weld fillet 78 can be formed to fixedly secure the rod to the outer ring. The outer end of the rod 74 is again cut off and contoured to match the outer periphery 72 of the outer ring 40 by suitable means such as grinding. In the event the alternate baffle structure illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14 is employed, when the rods 42b and 44b are driven or otherwise moved to their second positions firmly engaging the tubes 20 with the second regions of increased thickness 52b thereof, the rods are then securely engaged to the outer ring 40b by tightening the threaded bolts 62 to secure the rods between the ring members 56, 58 and 60. The outer ends of the rods are then cut off and contoured to conform to the outer periphery 72b of the outer ring 40b by suitable means such as grinding as described above. Once the baffle rods of the baffles 24 are fixedly secured in their second positions firmly engaging the tubes 20 with their outer ends contoured to conform to the outer periphery of the outer supporting rings, the tube bundle 14 thus assembled is ineerted into the open end of the shell 12 and properly positioned therein at which time the open ends of the shell 12 are closed by suitable end caps 80 and 82. It will be seen that the method and apparatus described above provides advantages in the construction of shell and tube heat exchangers, notably in the increased ease of assembly of this structure and in the reliable firm engagement of the tubes thereof intermediate their opposite ends. The transitional regions between the regions of reduced thickness and increased thickness facilitate the movement of the movable baffle rods from their first positions loosely engaging the tubes previously extended therepast to their second positions firmly engaging the tubes adjacent thereto. While four baffles, two having fixed baffle rods and two having lovable baffle rods, have been described above, it will be readily apparent to are substantially flat at their midpoints between adjacent regions of increased thickness. Such flat regions of reduced thickness are preferably oriented with the major axis thereof in alignment with the longitudinal axes of the tubes to thereby present a minimum cross sectional area to the flow of fluid around the baffle rods and reduce the pressure drop of the flowing fluid across the rods. To assemble the heat exchanger 10, the tubes 20 are inserted through the baffles 22 and 24 which are spaced apart as illustrated in FIG. 1. At this point the rods 42 and 44 of the baffles 24 are movably supported by the respective supporting rings 40 in the position illustrated in FIG. 4 thereby permitting the free passage of the tubes 20 through the baffles 22 and 24. The ends of the tubes 20 are then received through the corresponding apertures 64 formed in the tube sheets 16 and 18. When suitably positioned, the tubes 20 are fixedly secured to the tube sheets 16 and 18 with the end of each tube forming a fluid tight seal with the corresponding aperture in the tube sheet. Tha rods 42 and 44 of the baffles 24 are then driven or otherwise moved frois their first positions as illustrated in FIG. 4 to their second positions as iflustrated in FIG. 5, the dashed lines in FIG. 5 illustrating the previous positions for the rods 42 and 44. When the rods 42 and 44 of the baffles 24 are positioned as illustrated in FIG. 5, the tubes of the adjacent tube rows are firmly engaged by the second regions of increased thickness 52 on the rods 42 and 44. The rods are then fixedly secured to the outer ring 40 by suitable means such as by welding, as shown at 66 in FIG. 11, between the rod 44 and the corresponding aperture 48 formed in the ring 40 in which the rod is received. A similar weld connection is made between the end of each rod 42 and the corresponding aperture 46 in the ring 40. Each aperture 46 and 48 preferably includes a beveled portion 70 cc3municating with. the outer periphery of the supporting ring 40 in which a weld fillet 66 can be formed. The outer end of each rod is then cut off and contoured to conform to the outer periphery 72 of the outer ring 40 by suitable seans such as grinding as shown at 74. those skilled in the art that various numbers of both fixed rod and movable rod baffles may be employed in the construction of a beat exchanger in accordance with the present invention depending upon various design constraints. Similarly, while a square pitch tube layout is described above, other tube layouts may be employed in a heat exchanger constructed in accordance with the present invention. It will be noted, however, that the square pitch tube layout disclosed herein when employed with the baffle structures also disclosed herein provides full radial support for the intermediate portions of the tubes of the heat exchanger. Further, while outer supporting rings of circular shape are herein disclosed, it will be understood that the present invention envisions annular baffle and tube supporting structures of other than circular shape depending on specific heat exchanger design considerations. Reasonable variations and modifications which will be apparent to those skilled in the art can be made in this invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
