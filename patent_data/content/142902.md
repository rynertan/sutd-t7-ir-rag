# Colour television transmission or data storage system having time division multiplex encoding and data generator and receiver suitable therefor.

## Abstract
Colour television transmission or data storage system having time division multiplex encoding. A data source is coupled via an encoding circuit for time division multiplex coding and signal compression to a transmission or storage channel to which a data receiver comprising a decoding circuit is connectable. Luminance information associated therewith is transmitted after having been compressed in a number of q different line periods. The system is compatible with an existing colour television standard because the chrominance information supplied during the q line periods is also added to the luminance information during the p line periods in accordance with the standard.
