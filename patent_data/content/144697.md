# Method and device for produktion of metal blocks, castings or profile material with enclosed hard metal grains.

## Abstract
Process and apparatus for the production of metal blocks, casting or profile material 14 during which molten metal 53 in a chill K is moved from a heating zone HZ into a cooling zone according to the solidification speed of the molten metal S3 and during which cooling time hard material grains are continuously fed through the heating zone HZ , preferably being electrical heated molten slag 12 , the temperature of which is above the melting point of the hard material, into the molten metal S3 , the tempera ture of which is lower than the melting point of the hard material. The temperature of the molten slag, the height h of it and the height of the molten metal is controlled by the control device ST controlling the electrical current and dosing of the materials currents. Control methods and devices as well as material selec tions for matrix and doping materials are described.
