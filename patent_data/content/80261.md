## Description
Liquid Dispensing Package and ValveThis invention relates to a package which is for holding a quantity of liquid, and which is adapted so that, under certain circumstances, the liquid can be dispensed therefrom at will, and to a dispensing valve therefore.Although the package according to the invention can be used for the dispensing of any liquid which required to be dispensed, we are particularly interested in the utilization of the package for the dispensing of a concentrate for mixing with a diluent, e.g. for dispensing a flavouring syrup, in order to produce a carbonated beverage. That is to say, the package is adapted for connection to a dispensing system, such as might be embodied in a dispensing machine. Such a dispensing machine would be provided with a means for dispensing a diluent such as hot, cold or carbonated water, and the arrangement would be that upon operation of an actuator, such as a button, lever or the like, the diluent and concentrate are dispensed in predetermined ratios, into a drinking or other vessel, to provide a beverage suitable for consumption.In such an arrangement, if desired, any suitable carbonating, refrigerating and or heating system can be used, but as will become clear hereinafter, the package according to the present invention in addition to serving as the container for holding the quantity of concentrate also uniquely is provided with particular valving arrangements thereby in particular to facilitate the dispensing of concentrate in a system as outlined above.Typically in the prior art, dispensers for mixing a concentrate, such as a flavoured syrup, with a diluent, such as carbonated water, carry out their mixing in a mixing tap from which the mixed beverage is dispensed into a cup or glass. Typically, both the diluent and concentrate are conducted through tubing to a valving mechanism at the tap which meters the amounts of diluent and concentrate dispensed and mixed at the tap. Other units, which have been designed particularly for in home use, separately dispense the concentrate and carbonated water. In such devices, the user must first dispense concentrate into his cup, usually simply by judgement without any metering provided, and then add to the dispensed concentrate an amount of carbonated water.In dispensing devices in which mixing is done at the tap, there are serious disadvantages. First of all, dilute concentrate, which is typically a syyrup, remains in the area of the tap. As a result, there is a likelihood of mold formation and, unless the apparatus is regularly used and regularly cleaned, unsanitary conditions result.Secondly, where it is desired to supply a number of different types of drinks, the valving arrangements to couple into the tap the different concentrates becomes complex. Because of the use of tubing in the system, or if one tap is used to dispense different flavours, when one switches concentrates, some of the previous concentrate may remain in the system and at least initially the desired drink will not be obtained. Devices which utilise separate concentrate and water dispensers suffer from other disadvantages, particularly the disadvantage that a consistent quality drink will not be obtained since it is generally a matter of judgement in what proportions to mix the concentrate and water. Furthermore poor mixing takes place without stirring in which case carbonation is lost.Thus, it is evident that previous dispensing arrangement have suffered from various disadvantages because of which the widespread use of carbonated beverage dispensers in the home has not come about.In view of these difficulties, there has been invented a package for holding a quantity of liquid, particularly a concentrate for mixing with a diluent to provide a beverage, in which metering of the concentrate takes place in the container thereby permitting the concentrate to be dispensed directly from the container into a drinking vessel with mixing taking place just prior to or at the entry into the drinking vessel, in such a manner that dilute concentrate will not be present in the dispensing apparatus and the changing of concentrates will be facilitated, and such invention is set forth in European Patent Application No. 80200611.4, published under No. 0022589. Such Application also discloses a word dispensing valve and machine for use with the package.It is an object of the present invention to provide improvements in the package and dispensing valve disclosed in said European Application, referred to herein as the Prior Application, especially but not exclusively to make the package and dispensing valve suitable for the dispensing of diet syrup.As the disclosure of the prior Application is extensive and is relevant to the embodiment of the invention which follows, the entire disclosure of the said Prior Application is imported into this specification for the purposes of reference.The novel aspects of the present invention are explained with reference to embodiments of package and dispensing valve of the present invention, which embodiments are illustrated in and are now described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a preferred embodiment of dispensing valve for use in the present invention Figure 2 is a cross sectional view through the valve shown in Figure 1, with a package according to the invention fitted thereto andFigure 3 is a bottom plan view of the arrangement of Figure 1.Figure 1 shows an improved form of valve and manifold according to the present invention. The arrangement is essentially the same as that shown in Figure 6 of the Prior Application. The embodiment of Figure 1, however, is adapted for easier molding and is also adapted to be used with an improved form of valving mechanism in the container. Manifold 77a contains appropriate bores 182a to receive the rotating valve members 189a. As in the embodiment ofFigure 6 of the Prior Application, an outlet opening 105 for the diluent surrounded by an 0 ring seal 109 and an outlet opening 119 for the carbon dioxide surrounded by an 0 ring seal 123 are provided.The passages leading to the outlets 105 and 119, a portion of the passage 115a being visible in Figure 1 are molded into the manifold 77 such that they are of U shaped cross section. They are then enclosed by an appropriate cover piece which is bonded into place. The same scheme is utilized in forming passages 225a and 235a in the central rotating valve member 189a as will be seen below. A central opening 185a through which the spout 237a extends for dispensing diluent and also from which the concentrate can be dispensed is provided as in thePrior Application. Also included in a drainage slot 187a performing the same function as the drainage slot 187 of Figure 6 of the PriorApplication. As can be seen from Figures 1, 2 and 3, the rotating valve member is molded to be cup like with an outer cylindrical wall 190 which rotates within the opening 185a.Concentric therewith is an innerwall 192 which forms the opening in which the cap of the package is inserted, as best seen in Figure 2. Inner wall 192 contains a slot 215a therein in which the tab 213a Fig. 3 on a cap 230a is inserted. As explained in said PriorApplication, as the central rotatable member is rotated by means of a handle 191a, the cap will rotate therewith. Disposed over the base 181a and the rotatable central valve members 189a, and retaining them in place is a cover 201a having slots 218 to permit the handles 191a to extend therethrough. The cover contains a central opening in which diametrically opposed slots 217a are formed to engage tabs on the neck of the container. These take the place of the similar slots 217 in the adjustment disc of Figure 6 of the Prior Application. In the present embodiment, adjustment by means of an adjustment disc is not carried out. Rather, all adjustment to take care of temperature variations or the like can be done by controlliny pressure or by using temperature sensitive means in the outlet passage. Within the central valve member 189a between the walls 190 and 192, the expansion chamber 235a, for the diluent is formed by two curved walls 236 and 238 respectively. This chamber communicates with the spout 237a. The inlet to the chamber is through an inlet opening. When in the proper position, this overlies the diluent outlet 105.The wall 236, along with a wall 240 form the carbon dioxide chamber or passage 225a. Carbon dioxide flows from the chamber 225a into a chamber 225b which is formed in a strut 223a which extends from the wall 192. This termintes in a central cyclindrical member 227a which is adapted to be inserted into the central opening in the cap. An additional solid strut 223b helps support the member 227a. Member 227a is surrounded by an 0 ring seal 260a. In order to fully enclose the chambers 225a and 235a, a cover 194 is provided which is welded in place onto the rotatable valve member 189a so as to seal against walls 190 and 192 along with partitions 236, 238 and 240.Biasing of rotatable valve member 189a is by means of a spring 233a and a suitable post 232 on the base 181a. This biases the handle to the left as seen in Figure 1 so that neither opening 225c nor 235b are overlying their respective outlets 119 and 105. In this embodiment, there is no vent position. Rotation of the handle 191a to the right results in the opening 225c first coming to overlie the slotted opening 119, whereafter, with continued rotation, the opening 235b will overlie the outlet 105. In the present embodiment the container, when removed from the machine, remains pressurized.Thus, venting is not required. Other than the lack of venting, and the lack of an adjustment disc, the embodiment of Figure 1 is functionally identical to that of Figure 6 of thePrior Application. The changes are made simply to facilitate molding of the parts and to avoid the need to carry out machining. The channel 225b is closed off by a cover member 225d shown in Figure 2 but not in place in Figure 3. In this way, the major portion of the central valve number 189a can be molded whereafter the cover 194 can be put in place along with the cover or insert 225d, both sealed in place so as to provide the necessary chambers.Similar techniques are used in molding the manifold 77a so as to form various needed passages such as the passage 105a.Figures 2 and 3 also show a preferred valving arrangement for the package. In the embodiment previously disclosed in Figure 10 in the PriorApplication, the rate of concentrate dispensing was controlled by the amount of rotation. In the embodiment of Figures 2 and 3, the basic control of the amount of concentrate being dispensed is by means of the size of the opening 265a through the cap. This will be sized according to the type of concentrate being dispensed. For example, diet soda concentrate is much less viscous than syrups containing sugar. Thus for diet concentrates the diameter of the bore opening 265a will be much smaller. Furthermore, various types of check valves, which were previously tried, failed to adequately seal against leakage of a diet concentrate. For this reason, the embodiment ofFigure 2 uses a positive shut off valve rather than a check valve.As before, the cap is formed with a central bore into which the gas outlet 227a is inserted and sealed by means of the 0 ring seal 260a. This opening communicates with a tube 229a.In the embodiment of Figure 10 of the PriorApplication, this was a dip tube which contained in it a check valve. In the present embodiment, this tube, which has a flat end, seals against a cylindrically shaped seal member 242 preferably made of food grade silicone rubber. The cap can be made of polypropylene or low density polyethylene as may the plug 239a which is inserted into the neck of the package body 238a. The cylindrical plut 242 is retaaned in a projecting portion of the plug made of four equally spaced ribs 241a.The ribs extend from an annular surface 244. Annular surface 244 seats against an 0 ring 252a retained in a slot 257a in the cap. This prevents any of the concentrate, which will be surrounding the ribs 229a, from getting past this sealing point until the package is opened for dispensing. In addition, a further 0 ring seal 246 prevents leakage from the joint between the insert 239a and the body 238a.In operation, as in the embodiment of Figure 10 of the Prior Application, rotation of the cap 230a, which contains slots 273a in which tabs 211a on the body 238 are insrted, the slots 273a being slanted as shown in Figure 10b of the PriorApplication, results in the movement of the cap 230a with respect to the insert 239a. This simultaneously causes the tube 229a to separate from the cylindrical seal 242 to permit pressurizing gas to reach the interior of the package, and moves the annular part 244 away from the 0 ring seal 252a.As a result, flow of the concentrate can reach the outllt 265a. To prevent concentrate from escaping from below that poitn an additional 0 ring seal 259a is provided between surfaces of the insert 239a and the inner portion of the cap 230a. As these two surfaces move with respect to each other, the 0 ring seal maintains a seal therebetween.In this embodiment, when the package is first used, there will not be an elevated pressure in the package until the cap is forst rotated to open the valve formed between the tube 229a and the member 242.However, at the same time as pressurising takes place dispensing will commence since a passage to the outlet 265a will be opened. This of couuse only occurs on the first drink. It was thought that there might be some deterioration in quality in this first drink. However, tests have shown that there is no noticeable difference even on the first drink of, for example, 200m1. This due to the fact that the pressurizing gas enters more quickly than the concentrate leaves. The sealing arrangement shown in Figure 2 has been found to be particularly effective with all types of syrups. Although in the present embodiment, the seal at the tube 229A is against a member made of silicon rubber, by using plastic materials of different hardness for tube 229A and the insert, it is possible for the seal to be molded right into the insert.The central rotatable valve member can be made ofDelrin, an Acetal homopolymer with the lid 201a and base 181a made of ABS plastic. With the low viscosity of diet syrups, it has been found that a reduced pressure of one PSI is preferred in the container. By proper sizing of the outlet 265a along with this pressure, both diet and regular drinks can be dispensed. Furthermore, the tolerances established in the industry for drinks of this nature are maintained over an adequate range of temperatures without further adjustment.
