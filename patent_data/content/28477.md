## Description
A ROCKET ROTOR The prcsent invention relates to a rocket motor. Rocket motors using solid propellant charges generally have one or more jet nozzles of circular cross section. A rocket motor according to the invention comprises a combustion chamber for a solid propellant charge having an annular jet nozzle. Preferably the nozzle is defined between a surface of revolution on an inner member and a surface of revolution o an outer member1 which members are fixed in the rocket motor. Whilst it is envisaged that the inner member and the outer member may be annular members attached to the walls of tne combustion chamber, it is preferred that the inner and outer members be integral with the walls. In the motor described in greater detail below, the outer member is a casing extending integrally along the side walls of the combustion chamber and over one end wall thereof whilst the inner member is a back plate extending over the other end wall of the combustion chamber. Whilst it is not essential that the surfaces of revolution be precisely concentric, the rocket motor produces a more even thrust if this is so. Accordingly means may be provided for controlling the concentricity of the said surfaces on the inner and outer members in addition to the means whereby the embers are fixed.Spacers may be employed for this control. Shim or wire spacers may be used in the annular jet nozzle, either being left permanently in the nozzle or being removed before use of the rocket motor. Alternatively spaccrs may be fitted between the inner and outer members up stream or downstream of the nozzle. Further1 means may be provided for spinning the rocket motor by giving at least some of the propellant efflux gas a tangential component of velocity with respect to the annular jet nozzle. Slits may be provided in the said surface of the inner or of the outer member. Alternatively fins may be provided upstream of, downstream of or indeed in the annular nozzle. The fins may also serve to control the concentricity of the said surfaces. Preferably the said surfaces are contoured to give the jet nozzle a cross section which converges and then diverges in the direction of efflux gas flow therethrough. To help understanding of the invention, two rocket motors in accordance with the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a central longitudinal crosssectional view of one rocket motor Figure 2 is a similar view of another rocket motor and Figure 3 is a cross sectional end view on the line III III in Figure 2. The rocket motor of Figure 1 has a combustion chamber 1 having an annular jet nozzle 2 formed between a surface 3 on a back plate 4 and a surface 5 on a casing 6. The surface 3 is a surface of revolution about the axis 3 and the surface 5 is a surface of revolution about the axis 5 . The casing 6 is pot shaped with a cylindrical side wall 7 and an end wall 8 enclosing the combustion chamber of which the back plate 4 forms the other end wall. A pillar 9 formed integrally with the back plate 4 has a spigot 10 which locates in a bore 11 in the end wall 8. The casing 6 is held fast to the pillar by a nut 12 on a screwed end of the spigot. Thus the surfaces 3, 5 are fixed with respect to each other to define annular jet nozzle 2, the axes 3 , 5 being maintained coincident. A convergent divergent shape is given to the nozzle by the contour of the surfaces 3, 5 At the entry to the nozzle the inner rim 13 of the back plate has a rounded surface, which in cooperation with a cylindrical surface portion 14 of the casing defines the convergent entry to the nozzle.Outer portions 15, 16 of the surfaces 3, 5 taper to give the divergent exit from the nozzle. A ring 17 of solid propellant is fitted around the pillar 9. Ignition of the propellant is effected by an ignition charge 8 housed within the pillar, the hollow interior of which communicates with the combustion chamber 1 viP drillings 19. The ignition charge is ignited electrically by a fuse 20 whose wires 21 pass out of the rocket motor via a plug 22. The rocket motor is screwedly attached to a pay load 23 which it tows. Referring now to Figure 2, the rocket motor shown therein has a casing 106 and a back plate 104 which are substantially identical to the corresponding parts in the rocket motor of Figure 1. In particular the surfaces 103 and 105 are identical to the corresponding surfaces 3, 5 and they define an identical annular jet nozzle 102. By contrast with Figure 1, six shims 130 are spaced at regular intervals around the annular nozzle 102 to control the concentricity of the surfaces 103, 105 and thereby control the width of nozzle. A further difference from the Figure 1 rocket motor is the provision of final 131 mounted via an integral ring 132 on the forward end of the payload 123. The fins are positioned for the efflux gas to impinge on them after leaving the nozzle and thereby spin the rocket to stabilize it in flight. The propellant charge differs from that ofFigure 1 in being six separate charges 132 mounted on six pillars 133 which interconnect the casing 106 and the backplate 10. The pillars 133 are screwed into the backplate 104 thereby holding the shims 130 in place. A percussion cap 134 is provided for ignition of the propellant. The rocket motors of Figures 1 and 2 have particular advantage for towing a pay load. This comes in part from the fact that the pay load may be accommodated within the annular efflux gas stream and in part since they produce an even thrust around the jet nozzle and consequently tow the pay load in a straight flight. This contrasts with a prior rocket towing rocket motor which in effect consisted of to separate rocket motors positioned one on either side of the pay load. Due to imbalance between the two motors straight flight could not be reliably predicted. However rocket motors according to the invention are not intended purely for towing but may also be used for pushing pay loads. Another advantage of the rocket motors ofFigures 1 and 2 is that the narrowest portion of the convergent divergent nozzle is very narrow and thus a considerable expansion ratio, resulting in an efficient motor, can be provided in the divergent portion of the nozzle without excessively lengthening the nozzle.By contrast a single circular cross section nozzle having the same area at its narrowest portion would have a long nozzle were it to have the same expansion ratio. Further the considerable surface area of the circular surfaces makes the jet nozzle resistant to erosion. In addition the jet nozzle may be readily formed by simple machine operations.
