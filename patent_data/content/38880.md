## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a process for the production of an unsaturated glycol diester from a conjugated diene compound and, more particularly, it is concerned with a process for the production of an unsaturated glycol diester.comprising reacting a conjugated diene compound, carboxylic acid and molecular oxygen in the presence of a solid catalyst 2q DescriPtion of the Prior Art The above reaction is known. In particular, when the carboxylic acid is acetic acid, the reaction may be depicted illustratively as follows EMI1.1 wherein R1 to R6 are individually a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group, preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atom. Unsaturated glycol diesters are very useful as raw materials for various chemical processes. Above all, 1,4 glycol diesters are particularly important as raw materials for preparing organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran or synthetic resins such as polyurethane resins and polybutylene terephthalate and various proposals have hitherto been made for the production of the same. In the process for the production of 1,4 glycol diesters, it has been considered desirable to use a palladium type catalyst. For example, in U.S. Patent 3,755,423, l,4 diacetoxy 2 butene is obtained with high conversion as well as high selectivity by reacting 1,3 butadiene with acetic acid using a solid catalyst containing palladium, at least one of antimony and bismuth and at least one of tellurium and selenium. Even in the case of using this catalyst, however, the catalyst efficiency, in particular, the palladium efficiency Mols of diacetoxybutene formed Catalyst palladium atom.hour is quite low and unsatisfactory in comparison with the catalyst for the synthesis of vinyl acetate by .ethylene process which has already been practiced on a commercial scale as a reaction of this type. A representative patent of Mitsubishi Chemical Company, Japanese Patent Public Disclosure No. 11812 74, reported that the addition of a small amount of tellurium to the Pd C catalyst results in a dramatic increase in activity for acetoxylation with high selectivity to 1,4 diacetoxy 2 butene 92 .On On the other hand, BASF s patent, JapanesePatent Public Disclosure No. 63119 76, reported that carbonsupported palladium telluride Pd4Te C catalyst, which is prepared with a controlled ratio of Pd to Te and gave no diffraction line of metallic palladium in X ray analysis, shows good activity for acetoxylation. Both palladium efficiency for diacetoxybutenes DAB formation over Pd Te C 8.4 mol DAB g atom Pd Hr and Pd4Te C catalyst 6.4 , however, remained at an insufficient level as a commercial catalyst. Other patents in this area include U.S. Patents 3,671,577 3,922,300 4,075,413 4,121,039 and the following Japanese Patent Public Disclosures No. 47 39003 47 39004 47 39006 47 31919 49 101322 49 11813 50 51094 50 51095 51 149220 52 28495 Thus the prior art has taught that in the preparation of solvents such as 1,4 butanediol from butadiene, the key to the process is the initial acetoxylation step wherein a carbon supported Pd Te catalyst system is used.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicants have made studies on a catalyst system capable of producing unsaturated esters, for example, 1,4 diacetoxy 2 butene, with a higher catalytic efficiency suitable for commercial scale operation for the purpose of solving the above described problems and have found that unsaturated esters can be obtained with a high catalytic efficiency and a higher selectivity by the use of a solid catalyst containing a palladium, b tellurium and c at least one of tin, germanium and lead. The present invention is based on this finding. That is to say, the present invention provides a process for the production of an unsaturated glycol diester, which comprises reacting a conjugated diene compound, a carboxylic acid and molecular oxygen in the presence of a solid catalyst containing a palladium, b tellurium and c at least one of Group IV elements of the PeriodicTable selected from the group consisting of tin, germanium and lead. These are the heavy metals of Group IVA.DETAILED DESCRIPTION The metallic components used for the preparation of the catalyst used in the process of the present invention come from the following compounds For palladium, there may be used palladium chloride, palladium nitrate, palladium sulfate, palladium hydroxide, palladium oxide and the like. For tellurium, there may be used tellurium dioxide, tellurium trioxide, tellurium dichloride, tellurium tetrachloride, tellurium tetraoxide, telluric acid and the like. For the third components, i.e., tin, germanium and lead, there may be used their oxides, chlorides, nitrates, carboxylates and the like, for example, stannous chloride, tin nitrates, tin oxides, germanium tetrachloride, germanium oxides, germanium hydroxides, lead nitrate, lead chloride, lead acetate, etc. The support for the catalytic components is not particularly limited, but, for example, active carbon, silica gel, silica alumina, alumina, pumice, kieselguhr and silicon carbide may be used. In particular, active carbon is preferred. The support may be used as it is commercially sold or after it is subjected to a heat treatment or an acid treatment with nitric acid or hydrochloric acid. The method of supporting the catalytic components may suitably be chosen from the ordinary methods of preparing supported catalysts. In the case of supporting by impregnation, for example, catalytic components are dissolved in a suitable solvent such as water, aqueous acidic solution of hydrochloric acid or nitric acid, aqueous alkaline solution or organic solvent, in which a support is immersed. Catalytic components may simultaneously or successively be dissolved in a solvent followed by impregnation. In the present invention, the amounts of the catalytic components supported are preferably adjusted as follows. The amount of palladium supported is preferably 0.1 to 10.0 by weight and even if less than 0.1 by weight or more than 10.0 by weight, the reaction can proceed. The amount of tellurium is preferably 0.01 to 5.0 by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 3.0 by weight.The amount of at least one of tin, germanium and lead is preferably 0.01 to 10.0 70 by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 3.0 by weight of the total catalyst. The atomic ratio of tellurium and at least one of tin, germanium and lead to palladium in the catalyst is preferably 0.05 to 10 gram atoms to 1 gram atom of palladium, more preferably 0.1 to 5 gram atoms of tellurium and 0.1 to 2 gram atoms of at least one of tin, germanium and lead to 1 gram atom of palladium. The support having the catalytic components is then subjected to removal of the solvent and to reduction in a hydrogen stream or in a gaseous stream containing an organic compound capable of reducing, in general, at a reducing temperature of 1500 to 50O0C., preferably 2000 to 400 C., for 2 to 10 hours, thus producing a catalyst. Examples of the conjugated diene compound used as a raw material in the process of the present invention are 1,3 butadiene and hydrocarbon substituted derivatives thereof such as isoprene, 1,3 pentadiene, 2,3 dimethyl1,3 butadiene, 1,3 hexadiene, 2,4 hexadiene, 1,3 octadiene and 4 phenyl l,3 butadiene, and cyclic conjugated diene compounds such as cyclopentadiene, 1,3 cyclohexadiene and 1,3 cyclooctadiene. Above all, 1,3 butadiene is preferred. It is not always required that the conjugated diene compound be pure, but nitrogen, carbon dioxide or a lower saturated hydrocarbon such as methane, ethane, propane or butane may be admixed therewith. The carboxylic acid as another raw material in the process of the present invention may be selected from saturated or unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids and aromatic carboxylic acids having 2 to 20 carbon atoms.Lower aliphatic mono carboxylic acids containing 2 to 4 carbon atoms such as acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid are preferably used and, in particular, acetic acid is more preferable. The molecular oxygen used in the process of the present invention does not have to be pure but may be diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide, and of course may be air. The reaction conditions employed in the process of the present invention are as follows The reaction may be carried out batch wise or continuously in liquid phase using a fixed bed or fluidized bed. The reaction temperature, pressure and feed quantities of a conjugated diene compound, carboxylic acid and molecular oxygen are not particularly limited but preferably the reaction temperature ranges from 40 C to 1800C., the pressure ranges from atmospheric to 100 Kg cm2 and the molar ratio of conjugated diene compound carboxylic acid molecular oxygen is in the range of 1 0.5 10.0 0.1 5.0.
