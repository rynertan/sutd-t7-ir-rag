# Method of controlling iron induced fouling in water systems.

## Abstract
A method of inhibiting corrosion and controlling deposi tion in aqueous mediums, such as in cooling water systems, especially those wherein iron containing well water is used as a water make up source, is provided. The method comprises ad dition of certain water soluble copolymers having particular types of repeating units, to the aqueous medium.
