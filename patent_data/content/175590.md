# Apparatus for processing multiple asynchronous composite video signals.

## Abstract
The apparatus may be a digital TV receiver which dis plays the image for an auxiliary channel as an inset in the image for a main channel. The asynchronous composite vi deo signals of the main and auxiliary channels are time divi sion multiplexed 22, 24, 14 one line of auxiliary signal for every three lines of main signal. The chrominance and lumi nance components of the main channel signal are separated by an adaptive comb filter 40, 310 . A low pass filter 350 removes the luminance vertical detail compo nents from the combed main channel chrominance and also separates the luminance components Y
