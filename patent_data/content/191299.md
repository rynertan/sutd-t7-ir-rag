## Description
This invention relates to a cross linking composition used for cross linking blends of an epihalohydrin rubber and i halobutyl rubber or ii a mixture of butyl rubber and halobutyl rubber wherein the halobutyl rubber is at least 50 by weight of the mixture. Tire liners based on cross linked blends of halobutyl rubber and butyl rubber experience difficulty due to sensitivity to entrapment of gases, particularly air. In the past, epichlorohydrin rubber has been cross linked with the aforementioned blends to improve impermeability See, e.g., US A 3,586,087 . However, while these improved tire liner compositions have good air impermeability, they do not have a good balance of cure rate, scorch safety and physical properties, and do not adhere well to the tire carcasses, which are primarily natural rubber. According to the invention a cross linking composition for cross linking a blend of A halobutyl rubber or a mixture of butyl rubber and halobutyl rubber and b an epihalohydrin rubber is claimed according to claim 1. Further embodiments can be found in the dependent claims. The rubber blends cured with the cross linking composition of this invention have an excellent balance of cure rate, cure state, scorch safety and physical properties and have improved tire carcass adhesion while exhibiting good impermeability to gases, especially air. The cured blends are useful in tire inner tubes and inner liners for pneumatic tires, where sensitivity to gas entrapment is important. Sulfur curative systems cure through the unsaturation present in halobutyl rubber or mixtures thereof with butyl rubber. The nonsulfur curative systems cure through the halogen functionally of the halogen containing rubbers of the blend. Sulfur accelerators are mercaptobenzothiazole and its derivatives, such as mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide, 2,2 dithiobis benzothiazole and its salts, tetramethylthiuram, cadmium diethyl dithiocarbamate, N cyclohexyl 2 benzothiazyl sulfenamide, and N,N diisopropyl 2 benzothiazylsulfenamide. Preferable nonsulfur curatives are 2,5 dimercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole, 2 mercapto 1,3,4 thiadiazole 5 benzoate, trithiocyanuric acid, dithiohydantoins, dimercaptotriazoles, dithioltriazene, and their ester derivatives, alone or together with an appropriate organic base activator as set forth in U.S. A 4,128,510 and U.S. A 4,288,576. Preferable metal compound promoters selected from oxides, hydroxides and carbonates of the metals in Groups Ia and IIa of the Periodic Table of the Elements are magnesium oxide and barium carbonate. The optimum amounts of the cross linking compositions will depend upon the degree of cross linking desired, the degree of scorch safety desired, and the rate of cure desired. The determination of the amounts to be used is well within the skill of those in the art. Preferably the sulfur curative system is present in the cross linking compositions of this invention in an amount, for each 100 parts by weight of the rubber blend, from 1.7 parts to 9 parts, and more preferably 3.0 parts to 7 Parts. Preferably the nonsulfur curative system is present in the compositions of this invention in an amount from 0.5 part to 7 parts, and more preferably 0.7 part to 5 parts. Preferably the sulfur curative system consists of, for each 100 parts by weight of the rubber blend, from 0.2 part to 1 part sulfur from 0.5 part to 3 parts useful accelerator and from 1.0 part to 5 parts, more preferably from 1.5 parts to 3.0 parts, zinc oxide promoter. Preferably the nonsulfur curative system consists of, for each 100 parts by weight of the rubber blend, from 0.2 part to 2 parts nonsulfur curative compound, and from 0.3 part to 5 parts, more preferably from 0.5 part to 3.0 parts, Group Ia or IIa metal compound promoter. The Group Ia or IIa metal compound promoter also functions as an acid acceptor. The cross linking composition of this invention is used to cross link or vulcanize rubber blends of, by weight, a from 35 to 85 of halobutyl rubber or a mixture of butyl rubber and halobutyl rubber wherein the halobutyl rubber is at least 50 by weight of the mixture, and b from 15 to 65 of epihalohydrin rubber. The rubber blends can be prepared by blending the rubber compounds together with all desired ingredients, except the cross linking composition of this invention, in any desired fashion that allows intimate mixing for example, in a Banbury mixer or two roll differential speed mill. The cross linking composition of this invention can then be incorporated or mixed with the blended ingredients in any desired fashion, such as by simply milling the blended ingredients and the cross linking composition on a conventional rubber mill. Preferably the milling is conducted at 50 C to 90 C. Other methods of mixing the cross linking composition with the polymer will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Cross linking is effected at elevated temperatures. In general the cross linking temperature will be from 140 C to 260 C, preferably from 150 C to 225 C, and most preferably from 150 C to 205 C. The time will vary inversely with the temperature and will range from 5 seconds to 10 hours. The cross linking temperatures and times are within the skill of those versed in the art. As is well known in the art, butyl rubber is a copolymer of from about 95.5 to about 99.5 mole isobutylene and from about 0.5 to about 4.5 mole isoprene. Halobutyl rubbers are halogenated butyl rubbers. The halogen is present as a result of post treatment of the butyl rubber by reacting chlorine or bromine with the butyl rubber by methods known in the art. Halobutyl rubbers include chlorobutyl, bromobutyl or mixtures of chloro and bromobutyl rubbers. Such materials include chlorobutyl and bromobutyl rubbers prepared by reacting chlorine or bromine with butyl rubber wherein the original unsaturation usually from about 0.5 to 3.0 mole isoprene residues is largely maintained. A suitable commercially available chlorobutyl rubber contains from about 1.1 to about 1.35 by weight of chlorine from about 0.5 to 2 mole unsaturation, and has a Mooney viscosity after 8 minutes at 100 C 212 F using the large 10.1cm 4 inch rotor of 40 to 89 ml. A satisfactory bromobutyl rubber prepared from a highly unsaturated butyl rubber contains from 2.1 to 3.0 by weight of bromine, a density at 25 C of 0.96, and evidences a Mooney viscosity at 100 C 212 F of 40 to 70 ml. Generally, the halobutyl rubber or the mixture of butyl rubber and halobutyl rubber is present in an amount of from 35 to 85 by weight of the rubber content, preferably from 40 to 75 . Halobutyl rubber is preferred. Epihalohydrin rubber includes 1 homopolymers of an epihalohydrin, such as epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin and others, 2 copolymers of an epihalohydrin with less than 30 of saturated epoxy monomers or with an unsaturated epoxy monomer, and 3 terpolymers of an epihalohydrin with a less than 30 of a saturated epoxy monomer or mixtures thereof, b an unsaturated epoxy monomer or mixtures thereof, or c mixtures of a and b . The epihalohydrin polymers are prepared by polymerizing a monomeric epihalohydrin alone or together with one or more of the aforementioned epoxy monomers with a suitable catalyst, such as an organometallic catalyst. For example, a reaction product of water with an alkyl aluminum compound is a suitable organometallic catalyst. Such homopolymers are believed to have a repeating structure wherein X is a halogen, derived by a polymerization involving the epoxide linkages. Suitable halogens include chlorine and bromine. Typical saturated epoxy monomers include alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide, and typical unsaturated epoxy monomers include allylglycidyl ether. The epihalohydrin polymers are strong, rubbery materials sometimes evidencing more or less crystallinity, having high molecular weight, a density in the range of from about 1.35 to about 1.38, and after 4 min. at 100 C 212 F , a Mooney viscosity of from about 40 to about 80 ML. The properties and the preparation of epihalohydrin polymers suitable for use in the practice of this invention are more fully disclosed in U.S. A 3,158,500. Copolymers and terpolymers of an epihalohydrin with greater than 30 of saturated epoxy monomers, especially with alkylene oxide monomers, such as ethylene oxide, do not have the required air impermeability and are not useful in tire inner liners and inner tubes. Copolymers or terpolymers of epihalohydrin with unsaturated epoxy monomers, such as allylglycidyl ether, tend to cocure with the unsaturation of the halobutyl rubber or mixtures thereof in the rubber blend and the natural rubber in the carcass. Preferably, from 1 to 30 of an unsaturated epoxy monomer is used. Copolymers and terpolymers of epihalohydrin with a saturated epoxy monomer preferably contain less than 10 of the saturated epoxy monomer, and most preferably less than 5 . Preferably the epihalohydrin rubber is present in an amount of from 15 to 65 by weight of the total rubber blend, preferably from 25 to 55 . The amount of a halobutyl rubber or mixtures thereof with butyl rubber and b epichlorohydrin rubber present in the rubber blend totals 100 . In addition to the cross linking composition of this invention, the rubber blend may contain other ingredients commonly used in rubber vulcanization. For example, extenders, fillers, pigments, stabilizers, antioxidants, tackifiers, plasticizers, and softeners may be added. The presence of a filler, particularly carbon black, while not necessary, is beneficial. The particle size of the filler is not critical. Other additives such as polychloroprene rubber, mineral rubber blown asphalt , and chlorinated hydrocarbon polymers, such as chlorinated polyisoprene rubber and chlorinated polyolefins, may be present in an amount from about 1 to about 10 by weight of the rubber blend. Typically the chlorinated hydrocarbon polymers have a chlorine content of from about 30 to about 70 , by weight, preferably 40 to about 66 , and a molecular weight of about 50,000 to about 1,000,000 as determined by size exclusion chromatography. Chlorinated polyisoprene having from about 63 to about 66 by weight chlorine is the preferred chlorinated hydrocarbon polymer. The polychloroprene improves green strength, the mineral rubber improves aged adhesion, and the chlorinated hydrocarbon polymers generally tend to improve the impermeability to air and other gases. The following examples set forth in Table 1 illustrate the invention. The controls or comparative examples are set forth in Table 2. The examples and the controls are prepared by the same procedure as set forth above. The properties of the examples and controls are set forth in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. All parts and percentages in this specification are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Adhesion to the tire carcass of at least 4.5 25 T Peel kg cm lbs. in pli is acceptable however, preferably it is greater than 5,4 30 T Peel kg cm lbs. in. pli. A Mooney scorch of 16 minutes or better is good for the 3 point rise, and 20 minutes or better is good for the 5 point rise. Tensile strength of at least 62.0 bar 900 psi is acceptable, preferably greater than 62.0 bar 900 psi . Control 1 shows that a rubber blend containing a large particle size carbon black and oil when cross linked with magnesium oxide and ethylene thiourea conventional cross linking system does not provide an acceptable tensile strength, whereas the same rubber based composition Example 1 when it is cured with the cross linking composition of this invention does provide acceptable tensile strength. Control 2 shows that the same rubber blend containing small particle size carbon black and no oil when cross linked with a conventional cross linking system likewise does not provide an acceptable tensile strength or scorch safety, whereas the same composition Example 2 when it is cured with the cross linking composition of this invention does provide acceptable tensile strength and scorch safety. Control 3 shows that a rubber blend containing smaller amounts of chlorobutyl rubber 25 when cross linked with the cross linking system of this invention does not provide a material having acceptable scorch or adhesion properties. Control 4 shows that the sulfur curative system alone and Control 5 shows that the nonsulfur curative system alone, when used to cross link a respresentative rubber blend, do not provide materials having acceptable scorch properties. Further, nonsulfur curative system alone Control 5 , does not provide a material having acceptable tensile strength properties. Usually oil makes rubber compositions more permeable to gases. While the composition of Example 1 is more permeable to gases than the composition of Example 2, it still has improved scorch safety, cure rate and physical properties. The tire carcass is typically natural rubber with other rubbers, such as styrene butadiene, added in lesser amounts and cured with a conventional sulfur cure system. Thus, this invention provides a sulfur and nonsulfur cross linking composition especially adapted for cross linking blends of a halobutyl rubber or a mixture of butyl rubber and halobutyl rubber wherein the halobutyl rubber is at least 50 by weight of the mixture and b an epihalohydrin rubber. Rubber blends cured with the compositions of this invention have a better balance of cure rate, cure state, scorch safety and physical properties and have improved adhesion to the tire carcasses and good impermeability to gases. The cured rubber material is especially useful in tire inner tubes and tire inner liners, particularly in a pneumatic tire having cured rubber liner ply overlying all internal tire surfaces exposed in service to pressurized gas. The expressions consists essentially of and consisting essentially of as used in this specification excludes any unrecited substance at a concentration sufficient to substantially adversely affect the essential properties and characteristics of the composition of matter being defined, while permitting the presence of one or more unrecited substances at concentrations insufficient to substantially adversely affect said essential properties and characteristics.
