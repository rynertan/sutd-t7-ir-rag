# DIAGONAL CONICAL HORN REFLECTOR ANTENNA

## Abstract
A horn reflector microwave antenna has a reflector plate 11 which is a section of a paraboloid, and a flared feed horn 10 for supplying microwave signals to the reflector plate 11 . The horn 10 has a conical section 32 forming a circular ap erture at the wide end, which is the end closer to the reflector plate 11 , and a pyramidal section 30 forming a square aper ture 31 at the narrow end, which is the end farther away from the reflector plate 11 . Microwave signals are supplied to the feed horn 10 with the electrical field E extending along a di agonal of the square aperture 31 .
