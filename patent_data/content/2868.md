# Fire detector.

## Description
Fire DetectorThis invention relates to a fire detector connectable to a control panel by electrical lines and comprising sensor means for sensing a fire phenomenon such as heat, smoke, gaz.or light and operating switching means short circuiting the lines and sensing an alarm current flowing in the lines to the control panel when a fire has been detected.Fig. 1 shows a circuit diagram of a fire alarm system provided with fire detectors De of this kind in prior art.These fire detectors De may be connected in parallel with each other between a pair of lines t1 and 12 extending to a con 1 2 trol panel Re.The operation of this known fire detector is as follows When a sensor, e.g. thermistor Th of the detecting elementDe has received heat emitted by a fire, the resistance of the thermistor drops and the potential Vb at the junction point b of the thermistor Th and the resistor R1 is also reduced. When the potential Vb has reached a voltage less than the emitter potential Ve of the transistor T1 which is determined by the resistances of the resistors R2 and R3, the transistor T1 will be turned ON and a thyristor T2 will also be ON by a voltage drop occuring across resistor R4.As a consequence, a current starts to flow from plus termi nal of the power source E located in the control panel Re through the reset key Kr, line 72 , the parallel circuit of operation indicating lamp La and resistor R5, thyristor T2, line 1 r diode D4 and zone relay N operating as signal receiving relay. Then, relay N operates and closes its contacts nl, n2 and n3. By the closed contact n1 the operation of the relay N self holds, through the contact n2 a zone lamp Lf lights up, and further an operation indicating lampLa of the detector De lights up through the contact n3 and the resistor Rill. In this case, the diode D4 prevents the lines 1 and 2 from short circuit due to the closing of the contact nl. When such fire detectors De are used for a fire alarm system, in the event of a fire, a large current nearly equal to the short circuit current flows through the lines 1 and via the thyristor T2. Furthermore, if any further detector connected with the detector lines not shown in the circuit diagram is actuated successively, there is the possibility of coming short of the capacity of the power source E located in the control panel Re.Additionally, such a fire alarm system has the disadvantage that when a detector connected between lines 1 and t2 has actuated, no 1 2 other detector connected to the same lines is able to de tect a fire because the voltage between lines 1 and t2 will 1 2 drop to a voltage nearly equal to the short circuit voltage which is not sufficient for operating the other fire detectors.This invention aims at obtaining a fire detector avoiding the above mentioned draw backs of prior art and whereby even if fire detectors connected to plural detector lines are operated successively, there is no possibility of coming short of the capacity of the power source in the control panel, and whereby even after one detector in a detector line has been operated, fire detection by other detectors connected to the same detector line is still possible.This object is achieved by providing a timer circuit arranged in one of said lines having a predetermined switching time during which the alarm circuit is allowed to pass to the control panel in order to operate s signal receiving relay and after lapse of which the line current is reduced to a smaller value sufficient for holding the operation of said switching circuit.Embodiments of this invention are described hereinafter in connection with the drawings in figures 2 6.Fig. 2 shows a circuit diagram of an embodiment of a fire detector of this invention.Fig. 3 shows time charts showing operating conditions of various parts of this embodiment.Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 show circuit diagrams of two kinds of control panels connected with embodiments of this invention.Fig. 6 shows a circuit diagram of a part of another embodiment of the invention.Fig. 2 shows a circuit diagram of an embodiment of a fire detector of this invention. This fire detector De consists of a fire detecting circuit 1, a switching circuit 2 operated by the output of the circuit 1, a timer circuit 3 which is so constructed that when the circuit 2 has operated a large current nearly equal to the short circuit current flows through the signal receiving relay N located in the control panel via the circuit 2 for a sufficient time for operating the said relay, an operation indicating circuit 4 which forms an oscillation circuit for lighting up the operation indicating lamp upon completion of the operations of the circuit 3, and a power source voltage stabilizing circuit 5.The fire detecting circuit 1 and the switching circuit 2 are amp as the corresponding circuits shown in Fig. 1, the timer circuit 3 and the operation indicating circuit 4 are arranged side by side and connected in series to the line 12 t and the power source voltage stabilizing circuit 5 is connected between the lines 1 and t2 extending to the control panel Re, shown in fig. 4.The operation of this fire detector is described hereinafter in connection with a control panel shwon in fig. 4 and the time charts shwon in fig. 3. In supervisory condition, a small supervisory current flows from the line 12 to the line through resistors R8 and Rg in the circuit Q, a parallel circuit consisting of resistor R1, thermistor Th and resistors R3 R2 in the circuit 1, and a diode D3. Since the current is very small, the voltage produced between both ends of the series circuit of resistors R8 and Rg is also rather low. When the thermistor Th has received heat emitted by a fire, the resistance of the thermistor will decrease and the potential Vb at the junction point b will drop as shown in fig. 3 a . When the potential Vb has dropped lower than the emit ter voltage Ve of the transistor T1, the transistor T1 will T1, the transistor T1 be turned ON, a voltage nearly equal to the power source voltage will be applied to both ends of the timer circuit 3 and the operation indicating circuit 4, and a charge current of the condenser C1 arranged in the timer circuit 3 will flow through the emitter and the base of transistor T3 via resistor R6 which causes transistor T3 to turn ON. Condenser C2 in circuit 4 will be charged in an instant via transistor T3 and relay A which has a small internal resistance and is used for operating auxiliary devices, e.g. for driving an interlocked controller to close an air conditioning duct in the room in fire. When the charge voltage of the condenser C2 has exceeded the gate voltage of theN gate thyristor T4, the thyristor T4 will be ON. The state of operations of the transistor T3 and the relay A is shown in fig. 3 c .When the thyristor T4 has been ON, a large signal current being nearly equal to the short circuit current will flow from the line 2 to the line 11 via T3, A, T4 and light emit 2 T4 ting diode D2 working as signal receiving relay and located in the control panel to operate.When the relay N has been operated it will perform the first control such as stopping of air conditioner etc. in the zone in fire, and at the same time the contacts nl, n2 and n3 will be closed and the operation of the relay N will become self hold, the zone lamp Lf will be lit by the contact n2, and a current for lighting up the operation indicator D2 of the detector De will be supplied to the operation indicating circuit 4 through the contact n3 and the resistor Rill. In this case while a large signal current flows through the lines t1 and t , the tran 1 2 sistor T5 is ON by a voltage produced in the resistor R11 via the load resistance R13, and the counter circuit C counts one by a voltage produced in the resistor R13.But at this time no output is produced by the counter circuitC and the transistor T6 cannot be ON, and accordingly, the relay B for performing the second control such as to control the smoke ventilator etc. cannot be operated.Time tl while the transistor T3 located in the timer circuit 3 of the detector De is ON can be determined to be a desirable value by the time constant determined by the resis tance of the resistor R5 and the capacity of the condenser C1.In this case the resistance or the resistor R6 shall be sufficiently larger than that of the resistor R5. When the transistor T3 has been OFF, the N gate thyristor T4 located in the operation indicating circuit 4 which forms the oscillation circuit will be OFF, and the circuit 4 will begin to oscillate normally with a regular frequency given by the time constant determined by the resistance of the resistorR7 and the capacity of the condenser C2. Hereafter the diodeD2 is flickering as shown in fig. 3 d . Furthermore, when the transistor T3 has been OFF, the current flowing in the lines through the thyristor T2 will be changed over to a smaller value just above the minimum self holding current for maintaining the self holding of the thyristor T2.This minimum self holding current flows through the resistorsR8 and R9,and the line voltage applied to the actuated detector De is reset to the almost normal voltage. Fig. 3 e shows a periodical change of the line current It flowing through the lines t1 and t2 and fig. 3 f shows a periodical change of the line voltage V between the lines t1 andNow, when another detector connected with the same detector circuit has actuated, the line voltage Vt will drop during the time t1 soon after the actuation to a voltage nearly equal to the short circuit, but the minimum self holding current of the thyristor T2 of the previously actuated detector is supplied by the discharge current of the condenser C3 located in the power supply stabilizing circuit 5 through the resistors R8 and Rg.The transistor T5 located in the control panel is ON by the voltage produced again in resistor R11 by the actuation of this other detector, and the counter circuit C counts two0 and the transistor T6 is also ON by the output of the switching circuit 2 at that time, thus, relay B is operated to perform the second control such as to control the smoke ventilator etc.Fig. 5 shows a circuit diagram of another control panel Re which may be used in connection with the detectors De according to fig. 2. What differs this control panel from that shown in fig. 4 is merely the fact that the driving part D of an electromagnetic rotary switch unit F is driven by every ON of the transistor T5 and the wiper W of the rotary switch RS is advanced on the contacts No. O to No. 3 step by step, and when the wiper W arrives at the contact No. 2, a circuit to perform the second control is formed.Fig. 6 shows a circuit diagram of the timer circuit 3 and the operation indicating circuit 4 in which an amperemeter type operation indicator M is used instead of the light emitting diode D2 located in the operation indicating circuit 4 of the fire detector De shown in fig. 2. The embodiment shown in fig. 6 is just the same as that shown in fig.2 except the operation indicating circuit 4. In this circuit a diode D8 for protecting the aperemeter type operation indicator M is connected in parallel with a series circuit of the amperemeter type operation indicator M and a resistor R14 and further a resistor R7 is connected in series with the parallel circuit. The operation indicating circuit 4 is connected with the timer circuit 3 as shown in fig. 6.In this embodiment1 in the event of fire, when the thyristor T2 of the detector De has been ON, the large signal current flowing through the transistor T3 and the relay A mainly flows through the diode D8, and the supervisory current in the supervisory condition and the self holding current of the thyristor T2 flow through the resistors R7, R14,and the indicator M. The indicator M is operated by a part of the large signal current and is self held by the self holding current of the thyristor T2 It should be noted that the heat sensing thermistors in the above described embodiments of the invention could be replaced by other sensing elements responding to other fire phenomena such as smoke, gas or light.For example the sensing circuit of the detector De may comprise an ionization chamber in series with a reference element, a photoelectric element or a semiconductor gas sensing element, instead of a thermistor. As above mentioned, this invention has the merit that when these fire detectors are used in a fire alarm system, a large current flowing through the detector once operated is promptly reduced to a small current, and the line voltage to which the detectors are connected is promptly returned from a voltage nearly equal to the short circuit voltage to the voltage nearly equal to the normal voltage, and accordingly even if the fire detectors connected to plural detector lines are operated successively, there is little possibility of overlapping the large currents flowing through these detectors and therefore there is no possibility of coming short of the capacity of power source located in the control panel, and the detection of fire by another detector is possible even after an already actuated detector connected is with the same detector line.
