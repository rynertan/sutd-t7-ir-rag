# Taphole opening apparatus for blast furnaces.

## Abstract
The operator of a taphole drilling apparatus for blast furnaces performs manual changes on the apparatus in its safe position of rest and operation by remote control and automatic latching in hazardous taphole work including dril ling and subsequent driving, release, and extraction of a tap bar. The usual guide rail 22 carrying reciprocably a hammer drill 30 thereon incorporates a remotely openable automati cally latching centralizer 42 at its forward end and an extrac tion carriage 29 on which, after removal of the drill steel 43 , an impact sleeve 50 can be manually mounted for being impacted by the hammer drill 30 . In one mounting position of the impact sleeve 50 , a latch 57 therein is biased to automatically latch the shank of a tap bar 53 thereto for extraction by impacts. In a 180 counter turned position the latch 57 will fall aside and the mounted sleeve 50 is used to drive the tap bar while guided by the centralizer 42 . The sleeve 50 can then be retracted freely from the tap bar 53 and the guide rail 22 freed by unlatching the centralizer 42 from the tap bar 53 .
