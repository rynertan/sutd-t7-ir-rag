# Electrodeposit of a white gold alloy, its preparation and electroplating bath.

## Abstract
Electrodeposition of a hard, bright, ductile gold alloy having a white coloration, useful for decorative purposes, is effected using an aqueous cyanide free electroplating bath essentially comprising a from 4 to 20 g l of gold, b from 0.2 to 5.0 g l of palladium, c from 0.1 to 3.0 g l of copper, d from 5 to 200 g l of free sulphite ion, e from 0 to 150 g l of one or more buffering agents and or conducting salts, and f water. The bath has a pH in the range from 7 to 10.5, preferably about 9.5 and electrodeposition of the white alloy can be carried out at a cathode current density of from 0.25 to 1.25 amp dmÂ² and a temperature of 50 to 65 C., preferably with moderate agitation of the cathode during the electroplating process The white alloy will normally contain, on a parts by weight basis, 85 95 gold, 3 10 palladium and 2 5 copper, the palladium always being present in a larger amount than the copper. Such a bath is not as susceptible to colour stability problems as conventional cyanide based electroplating baths for producing white gold electrodeposits.
