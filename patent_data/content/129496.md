# All terrain vehicle.

## Abstract
The all terrain vehicle is equipped with an internal com bustion engine 17 which is connected to a torque responsive continuously variable transmission which in turn is connected to a simple automotive type differential 19 . One output of the differential 19 is connected to the right wheels 12, 14 and the other to the left wheels 11, 13 . The distance between the front to rear wheels, which are non steerable, is smaller than the distance between right and left wheels to minimize the vehicle s resistance to skid steering. A split brake system is provided to allow steering right by braking the right wheels and steering left by braking the left wheels.
