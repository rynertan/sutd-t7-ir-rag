# Audio response terminal for use with data processing systems.

## Abstract
An audio response terminal for a data processing system which provides an audio output for data that is displayed on a video display unit. The terminal has a control unit 20 that is separate from the display controls, 25 but receives inputs from the display buffer 2 and a separate key pad 7 . The control unit gives the user the ability to specify which rows or columns of a screen of data are to be spoken and also four modes of speech, spell, phonetic spell, speak with punctuation or plain speech. A microprocessor using a translator examines each alphanumeric character and provides a string of digitised phonemes which drive a speech synthesizer g . The speech synthesizer provides an audio output signal to a loudspeaker or headphone socket.
