# Process for the preparation of dimerization products from olefins.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of dimerization products from aliphatic mono olefins having 2 12 carbon atoms in which the aliphatic mono olefin is contacted with a catalytic system formed by combining a palladium and or ruthenium compound and an acid with a pKa of less than 2, except hydrohalogenic acids in an aprotic organic solvent.
