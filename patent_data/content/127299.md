# Method of predicting the quality of a resistance spot weld.

## Abstract
During a weld period in the formation of a resistance spot weld the weld parameters are monitored, and data represent ing the weld resistance curve and the power curve are acquired and stored for analysis by a suitably programmed computer. A prediction of the quality of a weld, and specifically as to whether a weld is a nugget or a sticker is made by calculating the ratio of weld energy after the onset of melting to the total weld energy, and also the ratio of the resistance drop after the resistance peak to the peak resistance, and then utilising the weighted sum of the energy ratio and the resistance drop ratio, as a weld quality indicator.
