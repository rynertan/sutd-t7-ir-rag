# Armature for bicycle saddles.

## Abstract
An armature 12 for supporting a shell 10 of a bicycle saddle from a clamp carried by a saddle sup port pipe consists of a single die forged piece of light alloy. The single piece 12 has a general shape similar to that of a fork with a yoke portion 14 , a pair of sym metrical prongs 16 extending in one direction each from a repective opposite end of the yoke portion 14 , and a stem portion 18 extending from the middle of the yoke portion 14 in a direction opposite to said one di rection and in a general plane of symmetry of the prongs 16 . Each of said prongs has a respective rectilinear fastening portion 20 extending from the yoke portion 14 and a respective tail portion 22 extending from the fastening portion 20 . The rectilinear fastening portions 20 are parallel to each other, so as to define a general base plane which is perpendicular to said plane of symmetry, and are adapted to be clamped in said clamp. The tail portions 22 diverge from each other and have free ends which are adapted to support a rear portion of the saddle shell 10 . The stem portion 18 has free end 26 which is adapted to support a front portion of the saddle shell 10 .
