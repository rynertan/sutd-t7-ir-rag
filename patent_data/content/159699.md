# A DATA PROCESSOR EXECUTING MICROPROGRAMS ACCORDING TO A PLURALITY OF SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES

## Abstract
A data processor controlled by microprograms which can run a desired program in a selected one of multiple sys tem architectural modes. In the data processor, the oper ation code of the instruction is used as an address for a de coding information storage which stores a plurality of pairs of a microinstruction start address and an editing format control word. A selector selects a pair of a start microin struction address and an editing format control word. The microinstruction start address is used for accessing a mi crocode control storage storing a plurality of micropro grams in microinstruction form. The editing format control is used as a editing designation signal for editing the operand of the instruction according to the selected mode.
