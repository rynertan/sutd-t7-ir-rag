# Fibrous ion exchange materials, their production and use.

## Abstract
Fibrous ion exchange materials comprise a macropor ous fibrous mass such as a woven or non woven fabric, having macroreticular ion exchange resin in the interstices between the fibers. They may be made by taking up monomer into the interstices and there polymerising the monomer in an aqueous medium in the presence of organic solvent insoluble or only sparingly soluble in water to form macroreticular polymer to which ion exchange functional groups are added. The materials may be used to remove or exchange ions in fluid, especially liquid or vapour, media.

## Description
FIBROUS ION EXCHANGE MATERIALS, THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE This invention is concerned with fibrous ion exchange materials, their production and use. The materials of the invention have a fibrous matrix with macroreticular ion exchange resin distributed in the interstices between fibers therein. Ion exchangers formed of polyvinyl monomers or mixed monovinyl and polyvinyl monomers, particularly those based on styrene, are generally granular in form, and measure between about 0.300 mm 50 mesh and about 1.20 mm 16 mesh in particle diameter. They are generally manufactured by suspension dispersion polymerization. The largest particle diameters which may be manufactured practically by such a polymerization process are limited by the largest stable monomer droplets that form in the aqueous suspension this is about 1.4 mm 14 mesh . The field in which uses are found for ion exchangers has expanded to a point where polymeric ion exchangers in larger particle sizes, or in special shapes, such as large sheets, large tubes and the like, are needed for special uses. These exchangers must be physically and chemically stable, and must possess practical levels of ion exchange capacity. Japanese Unsreened Patent Publication No. 20390 1977 discloses a method wherein a monomer mixture divinylbenzene, either styrene or vinylbenzyl chloride, and a polymerization initiator is fixed in a structure of fibers incapable of beingswelled or dissolved at least at the temperature at which the mixture polymerizes, the mixture is allowed to polymerize in situ in the fiber structure, the fiber component is removed from the resultant polymer by either decomposition or dissolution, and thereafter ion exchange functionality is introduced into the remaining polymer. Usually this ion exchanger must undergo an additional treatment, such as cutting and shaping, after the polymerizaticon step.The particle size or shape in which this ion exchanger is formed, however, does not necessarily fulfill the requirements mentioned above. A method has been proposed for manufacture of large particle size ion exchangers, which comprises causing a mixture of polymerization initiator and monomers to be deposited in the matrix of a fiber, subjecting the mixture as deposited in the matrix to polymerization, and thereafter introducing an ion exchange group into the resultant polymer. While this method produces ion exchangers with large, controllable particle shape, it fails to produce ion exchangers with the desired properties. Since by this method the functional group is introduced directly into the matrix of the copolymer fiber itself, the copolymer swells significantly upon functionalization.As a consequence of this swelling, strain is generated at the interface between the fiber substrate and the copolymer and this leads to separation of the copolymer from the fibers. The ion exchanger produced by this method, therefore, suffers from poor physical strength. This method is incapable of providing a product with satisfactory physical properties. We have now found a method which permits the successful manufacture large particle size ion exchangers, free from the disadvantages mentioned above. The ion exchange materials of the invention comprise fibrous ion exchange material comprising a macroporous fibrous mass, the interstices of which contain macro reticular, crosslinked polymer of polyethylenically unsaturated monomer and, optionally, monoethylenically unsaturated monomer, bearing ion exchange functional groups. They may be made, according to the invention, by 1 causing monomer to be retained in a macroporous mass of. fibers in the presence of a polymerization initiator and an organic solvent which is sparingly soluble or totally insoluble in water, 2 subjecting the retained monomer to polymerization in an aqueous medium, and 3 introducing ion exchange functional groups into the resulting polymer.It is important to the successful practice of the invention that the fibrous mass have large interstices between adjacent fibers in which to retain monomer, and that these interstices remain during imbibing of the monomer. Japanese Unscreened Patent Publication No.20390 1977 discloses the polymerization of monomers adsorbed within the fibers themselves, whereas in the present invention the pdlymer is to be found in the interstices between the fibers. As a result, during the introduction of the ion exchange functionality the fine pores present in the polymer absorb the strain generated at the interface between the fibers and the copolymer. Consequently, the tendency of the ion exchange material of the present invention to separate at the interface between the fiber and the copolymer is much less and the physical strength may be in consequence be made greater than the ion exchangers of the prior art.The shape and size of the ion exchange material of the invention may be freely selected in the light of enduse requirements, rather than being restricted by the requirements of the preparation method The mass of fibers used as the matrix for the ion exchanger of the present invention must possess proper interstices between the adjacent fibers, and it also must have superior chemical resistance and sufficient mechanical strength for the structure to retain its original shape during the agitation required for polymerization in the aquous medium. The fibers should be woven, knitted, bonded or otherwise joined together so that the required mechanical strength is imparted.Woven fabrics and non woven fabrics may therefore form suitable fiber structures. It is particularly desirable that the fiber structure should be cut to the desired size and shape prior to use in the method of this invention. Useful fibers include natural fibers such as wool, linen and cotton, fibers made of natural polymers, such as cellulose, synthetic polymer fibers such as modified cellulose, polyamides, acrylics, polyolefins including polyethylene and polypropylene, polyesters, polyurethanes, glass fibers and fluorocarbons. Preferred are polyolefin fibers, and most preferred are polyethylene and polyethylene fibers. Useful monomers include polyethylenically unsaturated polyvinyl monomers or mixtures of monoethylenically unsaturated monomers and polyethylenically unsaturated monomers. Examples of suitable monoethylenically unsaturated monomers are aromatic monomers such as styrene, methyl styrene, ethyl styrene, chlorostyrene and vinylbenzyl chloride, and aliphatic monomers such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate and butyl methacrylate.Examples of suitable polyethylenically unsaturated monomers include aromatic monomers such as divinylbenzene, trivinylbenzene, divinyltoluene and divinylxylene, and aliphatic monomers such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and divinyl adipate.The selection of other suitable monomers is well within the ability of one skilled in the preparation of polymers for ion exchange purposes. 0 The polymerization initiator used in the process of the present invention should be soluble in the monomer solution. Examples of suitable polymerization initiators include benzoyl peroxide, acetyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and azo bis isobutyronitrile. In the practice of the method of the invention, it is important that the monomer solvent employed be an organic solvent that is sparingly soluble or totally insoluble in water this solvent is present for the purpose of adjusting the physical behaviour of the polymer in the retaining structure. The organic solvents which meet the above requirements fall within three classes 1 organic solvents which are soluble in the monomer used, but are incapable of swelling the polymer which forms between the fibers 2 organic solvents which are soluble in the monomers, and are capable of swelling the polymer formed between the fibers. 3 organic solvents which are mixtures of the organic solvents of Classes 1 and 2.Generally, solvents of Class 1 are referred to as precipitants and those of Class 2 as swelling agents .All of these solvents function to impart fine pores to the polymer being formed. A more complete discussion of solvents, concentration parameters, and other important considerations in the formation of these fine pores macroreticular structure is found in BritishPatents 932125 and 932126. The solvents of Class 1 include iso octane, n butanol, t aminoethanol, methyl isobutyl carbinol, n heptane, 2 ethylhexanol, and sec butanol. The solvents of Class 2 include hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene, and halogenated hydrocarbons such as ethylene dichloride, propylene dichloride, trichloroethane and carbon tetrachloride.Other organic solvents which are usable include those prepared by dissolving linear polymers such as polystyrene, polymethylstyrene, polyacrylic esters and polymethacrylic esters in the abovementioned organic solvents and homogenizing the resulting mixtures. The degree of polymerization of the linear polymer employed in such solutions is not specifically limited. In actual practice, it is preferable to remove the linear polymer from the cross linked polymer by extraction. In the process of the present invention, the first step of entraining or imbibing the solution of monomer, organic solvent and polymerization initiator in the fiber mass may generally be accomplished by immersing the fiber mass in the solution and thereafter drawing the excess solution off the wet fiber structure. This procedure has the advantage of allowing the fiber structure to retain the largest volume of solution in the shortest reasonable time. The fiber masses entraining the solution may then be dispersed in an aqueous solution or an aqueous solution containing a dispersant and the dispersion then stirred and heated to induce polymerization of the monomer. The polymerization is carried out in the aqueous solution because of the ease with which the temperature of polymerization can be controlled.Alternatively, the polymerization may be performed by dispersing the fiber masses in advance in an aqueous solution which may contain a dispersant, and adding the monomer solution dropwise to the aqueous solution while agitating to induce polymerization. In either case, the amount of aqueous solution need only be sufficient to permit uniform agitation of the fiber mass in the reaction container. Amounts of aqueous solution 2 to 8 times the total weight of the monomer solution and the fiber masses is generally sufficient. The critical requirement for polymerization temperature is that it be higher than the decomposition temperature of the polymerization initiator.The preferred polymerization temperature is generally 0 from 50 to 100 C. The step of introducing the ion exchange group into the polymer thus formed in the fiber structure may involve any of the known ion exchange functionalization reactions. For example, a cation exchange resin may be obtained by sulfonating an aromatic polymer with sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid or sulfur trioxide, either directly or in the presence of an organic solvent capable of swelling the entrained polymer, and an anion exchange resin may be obtained by chloromethylating an aromatic polymer with chlromethyl methyl ether or hydrochloric acid, methanol and formalin, and subsequently aminating the chloromethylation product with amines such as trimethylamine, dimethylethanolamine, ethylenediamine or diethylenetriamine. In some cases, for example, where the entrained polymer is derived from vinylbenzyl chloride, the polymer may be aminated directly.Where an aliphatic ester polymer is the entrained polymer, a cation exchange resin may be obtained by hydrolyzing the ester linkage. An anion exchange resin may be obtained by further aminating the resulting cation exchange resin. The ion exchange materials of the invention may be used to remove or exchange ions in fluid, especially liquid or vapour, media. In the following Examples which illustrate some preferred embodiments of the invention and some comparative tests, all percentages and proportions are by weight and all reagents are of good commercial quality unless otherwise specified.

This procedure was repeated until the sulfuric acid concentration fell below 0.5 . An aqueous 10 solution of caustic soda was similarly added dropwise to neutralize the sulfonation product and convert it to the sodium ion form. In each case the resulting product was a yellowish brown, strongly acidic cation exchange resin the square measured from about 32 to about 36 mm on a side and 3 to 4 mm in thickness.
