# Method of and apparatus for cleaving optical fibres.

## Abstract
A method of cleaving a plurality of optical fibres 1 in which the fibres are tensioned over a surface 3 formed with a transverse gap 8 and a lightly loaded cutter 9 is brought slowly into contact with the fibres 1 over the gap 8 , and the pressure gradually increased. Such a process effects the cleaving of the fibres 1 substantially simultaneously, and avoids any significant redistribution of the tension between the fibres 1 before cleavage.

## Description
Method of and Apparatus for Cleaving Optical Fibres This invention relates to the cleaving of optical fibres. One method of cleaving individual optical fibres which has been found to be highly effective is described in co pending Patent Application No, 8400225 2134101 such a method comprising the steps of axially tensioning the fibre over a supporting surface, applying a lightly loaded cutter, moving radially with respect to the fibre axis under a low momentum, to the surface of the fibre, and subsequently increasing the load on the cutter to apply a correspondingly increasing radial pressure to the tensioned fibre until the fibre cleaves.The contact of the cutter with the fibre produces a shallow nick , i.e. an indent, in the fibre surface, and the axial tension applied to the fibre causes a fracture to propogate through the entire cross section of the fibre from the base of the nick around which the stress concentration is greatest, and the method has been found to achieve cleanly cut fibre surfaces lying within one or two degrees to the radial plane, without any appreciable hackle, that is to say gross surface roughness due to multiple fracture bifurcation. Hitherto it has been found difficult to cleave a plurality of parallel fibres satisfactorily in a single operation by this method. This is believed to be because the cutter does not always make contact with all the fibres simultaneously, due, for example, to variations in the external diameters of the fibres up to the allowed tolerances, or to the trapping of debris, produced by the removal of the plastic coatings from the fibres prior to cleaving, between one or more of the fibres and the supporting surface.The problem is more acute in the case of so called fibre ribbons in which a plurality, for example six or eight, plastic coated fibres are secured side by side, as it is necessary in most cases for all the fibres to be severed cleanly in the same transverse plane, and the failure of only one fibre to sever satisfactorily makes it necessary to carry out a further cleaving operation, with the resultant wastage of time and of fibres which this entails. The problem is aggravated by the fact that it is more difficult to remove the plastic coatings cleanly from the fibres of a fibre ribbon than it is from a single fibre. If the fibres are nicked sequentially they will tend to cleave sequentially and the tension in the last fibre to cleave could rise to such an extent that hackle appears on the cleaved face. In addition, depending upon the mechanism for applying the cutter to the fibre, it is possible that the momentum of the cutter as it touches the last fibre would be different from that with which it touches the first. According to the present invention a method of cleaving a plurality of optical fibres comprises tensioning the fibres over a surface in which there is formed a gap extending transverse to the fibre axes, applying a lightly loaded cutter moving radially with respect to the fibre axes under low momentum, to the surface of the fibres over said gap, and subsequently increasing the load on the cutter to apply a correspondingly increasing radial pressure on the tensioned fibres to effect a cleavage of the fibres. The presence of the gap results in a deflection of the fibre or fibres initially contacted by the cutter by a small amount, and compensates for variations of the fibre diameters. It will be seen that the maximum fibre deflection before each fibre is contacted will only correspond to the tolerance on the fibre outside diameter, over the width of the gap, so that there will be very little change in the stress distribution in the individual fibres It has been found that by this means it is possible to effect the cleaving of a plurality of fibres before any significant redistribution of tension between the fibres occurs, the fibres being initially tensioned subPstantially equally. The variation in time taken for all the fibres to cleave will depend, inter alia, on the maximum difference in fibre diameter and the momentum of the blade on impact, but in practice it has been found to be sufficiently short for the above condition to be met. The axial tension in the fibres and the momentum of the cutter as it contacts the initial fibre will generally need to be increased slightly compared with those needed for cleaving an individual fibre as described in the aforesaid patent application, and will depend upon the number of fibres to be cleaved, but the most satisfactory values for the tension and momentum for any particular application of the invention may readily be found by trial. The supporting surface is preferably convexly curved about an axis parallel to the gap, the fibres being arranged to be tensioned over the surface in uniformly spaced radial planes. The surface is preferably of part cylindrical shape and has radius of curvature of the order of 50 to 75so, with the edges which bound the gap preferably being polished to a smooth finish. Preferably also, the gap has a width of between 0.75 and 2.5mm, the surface over which the fibres are tensioned preferably being formed by two separate spaced members, at least one of which is conveniently movable to enable the width of the gap to be adjusted. The invention also includes within its scope apparatus for carrying out the cleaving of a plurality of parallel fibres by the method above described. Thus according to another aspect of the invention such apparatus comprises a convex cylindrical supporting surface having a gap formed therein parallel to the axis of curvature of the surface, means for holding a plurality of optical fibres in tension over said surface so that they extend, parallel to each other across said gap and substantially at right angles thereto, a cutter located over said gap and mounted for travel approximately perpendicular to said axis so as to enable it to be brought into contact with the fibres so held, and damped loading means for applying a gradually increasing load to the cutter. The loading means conveniently comprises a tiltable tube partially filled with liquid, the cutter being attached to the tube at a position offset from the tilt axis so that when the tube is tilted through the horizontal to bring the cutter close to the gap in the supporting surface the liquid travels along the tube, with the rate of flow limited by its viscosity, and increases the load on the cutter. The cleaving of a plurality of fibres by the method of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to Figures 1 to 3 of the accompanying schematic drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates diagrammatically, and not to scale, a perspective view of part of an apparatus for carrying out said method, Figure 2 illustrates a front elevation of a fibre support employed in the apparatuse, and Figure 3 represents a luch enlarged view of a section of the fibre support shown in Figure 2. The fibres 1, for example six as shown, are incorporated into a fibre ribbon, each fibre being coated with a synthetic plastics material, the coatings 2, which may consist of U.V. curable epoxyurethane acrylate, being bonded to each other, for example by the method described in co pending PatentApplication No. 8506499. After stripping the coating 2 from a region of the fibres 1, the fibres are laid, parallel t o each other, over the convex, part cylindrical supporting surface 3 of an anvil 4 formed from two separate elements 4.1, 4.2, which are mirror images of each other and are spaced apart a distance t of approximately imam, the width of the gap 8 between the elements conveniently. being finely adjustable in any suitable manner. The convex surfaces Of the anvil elements have a radius of curvature r of about 60mum, and the edges 5 of those surfaces which bound the gap 8 between the elements are polished to a smooth finish. On each side of the anvil 4 the fibres 1 are held in a clamp 6.1, 6.2 respectively, one of the clamps being fixed in position and the other being slidably movable towards and away from the anvil. The movable clamp 6.2 is coupled to means not shown for urging it away from the anvil under a controlled and adjustable force in order to tension the fibres 1, a gauge also not shown being provided for indicating the tension applied. Guides may be provided between the clamps 6.1, 6.2 and the anvil 4 if needed to maintain the fibres 1 correctly aligned and spaced uniformly from each other, although they will not normally be necessary. A cutter blade 9,which may be provided by a diamond or tungsten carbide is mounted at one end of a pivoted arm 11, in the form of a liquid filled tube, constructed and mounted as described in U.K.Patent Publication No. 2134101 A, and is arranged to be lowered gradually on to the fibres 1 over the centre of the gap 8, by rotation about a longitudinally extending supporting spindle 12. As the blade descends, it first contacts the uppermost fibre, which may be the thickest fibre 1.1 as shown in Figure 3, and will loose a small amount of momentum. However, as the tubular arm 11 has been tilted through the horizontal, the liquid 13 within the tube will travel along it towards the blade and with the flow rate limited by its viscosity, and then gradually increases the load applied by the blade 9. The fibre 1.1 will bow downwards under the blade 9, which will then contact the second uppermost fibre 1.2. This fibre will also be deflected slightly, the process continuing until all the fibres have been contacted and nicked by the blade. As the fibres are nicked the tension applied to them will cause them to fracture, and as the maximum fibre deflection is only the tolerance on the fibre outside diameter over the width t of the gap 8 it produces very little change in the stress distribution of the fibres.Moreover cleaving of all the fibres 1 occurs with sufficient rapidity to prevent any significant redistribution of tension between the fibres, and by this means it is possible to obtain uniformly clean cuts, with the cleaved 0 faces at angles of less than 2 to radial planes. Thus ribbons containing six fibres have been reproducibly cleaved with length variations of less than 100 microns between the shortest and longest fibres, and without the formation of any appreciable hackle in the cleaved faces.
