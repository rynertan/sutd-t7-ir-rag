## Description
2 PYRIDYLALKENESULFINYL BENZIMIDAZOLE.S The present invention relates to N substituted 2 pyridylalkylenesulfinyl benzimidazoles. Gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases are cfiaracterised by inflammation, specifically by the presence of edema, characteristic inflammatory cells i.e. leucocytes, histiocytes and macrophages , and, in some cases, necrosis and ulceration of the surface epithelium. These inflammatory diseases are known to be caused by a wide variety of agents, present in the gastrointestinal tract, which are known to attack the surfaces thereof, producing the inflammatory disease response. Such agents include micro organisms viruses and fungi , bacterial toxins, certain pharmaceutical agents antibiotics and anti inflammatory steroids and chemical agents bile salts, toxic household chemicals .Gastric acid itself is also capable of attacking the stomach lining and producing an inflammatory state. Certain gastrointestinal diseases, specifically gastric diseases, can be prevented or treated by the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, e.g. when the integrity of the gastric mucosal barrier is compromised, and gastric acid secretion can result in erosion of the epithelial cells, with consequent inflammation and ulceration. One class of agents which are known to be effective in the treatment and care of gastric and duodenal ulcers, as a result of the inhibition of gastric secretion, comprises the gastric anti secretory prostaglandins.See, e.g. US A 3903297 and Robert, ProstaglandinSymposium of the Worcester Foundation for ExperimentalBiology 16 17 1967, Interscience, New York 19781 pase 47. Another important class of anti secretory agents comprises the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, including metiamide and, most importantly, cimetidine. Gastrointestinal diseases can also be protected by cytoprotection, the effect being manifest in the ability of certain compounds to treat or prevent non traumatically induced, non neoplastic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. See US A 4083998,US A 4081553 and also US A 4097603 which makes it clear that gastric cytoprotection is unrelated to gastric anti secretion. Gastric anti secretory agents may not be cytoprotective agents, and vice versa. US A 4045563 discloses certain substituted 2 pyridylalkylenesulfinyllbenzimidazoles having gastric acid secretion inhibiting effects. US A 4255431 andUS A 4337257 discloses certain 2 2 benz imidazolyl pyridines which are useful in inhibiting gastric secretion.U.S. Patent 4,359,465 discloses the cytoprotective use of certain heterocyclyalkylsulfinylbenzimidazoles. Published European patent application 0130729 published 9 January 1985 discloses certain Sjb stituted 2 monoannelated 3,4 ,4,5 , and 5,6 pyridylalkylenesulfinyl benzimidazoles an antisecretory agents. Published European patent application 0150586 published 7 August 1985 discloses substituted pyridylmethyl thio and sulfinyl benzimidazoles as gastric antisecretory agents. Published British patent application 2,134,523 die certain N substituted pyridylalkyl benzimidazoles.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention particularly provides a compound formula I, wherein X is a S, or b SO wherein A and B are tne sa.me or different and are a hydrogen, b R1, c OR1, d CF3, e COR1, or f CO2R1 wherein R1 is C1 C4 alkyl wherein D is a substituent of the Formula II, III, IV, or V, wherein R3, R4 and Rio are the sane or different and are a hydrogen, or b C1 C4 alkyl wherein m i O or 1 wherein R2 is a SR5, b OR5, c N R4 2 d 1 piperidinyl, e 4 morpholinyl f 1 pyrrolidinyl, g chloro, h brano, or i fluoro wherein R5 is a C1 C4 alkyl, b C2 C4 alkenyl, c C3 C6 cycloalkyl, d CH2 PhX or e PhX wherein PhX is phenyl substituted by zero to 3 of the following a C1 C4 alkyl, b chloro, c bromo, d rluoro, e nitro, r CF3, or g OR3 wherein n is O or 1 and wherein V is a CH2, b 0, or c S wherein G is a hydrogen, b C1 C4 alkyl c COR6, d COPhX, e CO CH2 mC02R3, COCH2phX, or g C O O H11 wherein R6 is a C1 C10 alkyl, or b AA wherein AA is a CH2 p CH NH2 R9, or b a side chain of amino acid, wherein Rg is a hydrogen, or b C1 Cg alkyl wherein R11 is a C1 C12 alkyl, b C2 C12 alkenyl, c PhX, d CH2PhX, e CI C6 cycloalkyl, f CH2 C1 C6 cycloalkyl, or g C1 C6 alkyl substituted by one more bromo or chloro groups wherein p is an integer from 1 to 9, inclusive with the foil owing provisos 1 that the total number of carbon atoms in CH2 p and Rg are less than or equal to 9 2 m is zero only when G is C O O R11 and 3 G is C O O R11 only when R2 of Formula II is not OR5, or V in Formulas II, III or IV is MS.

Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the compounds or the present invention are chemically more stable than the benzimidazoles from which they are derived. They are particularly more stable in acid conditions, such as in the stomach. They are also more soluble in water, providing an improved means for pharmaceutical formulation.Further, these compounds retain strong antisecretory activity when administered subcutaneously and are generally more potent than the parent benzimidazoles when administered orally. Compounds or this invention have been tested in one or more standard laboratory tests which demonstrate gastric anti secretory activity. In a test for in vivo inactivation or H K ATP ase in the rat, 2 4 methoxy 3, 5 dimethyl 2 pyridinyl methyl sulfinyl benz imidazole, acetate ester compound 6 of Table I was shown to be the most effective, having an ED50 of 1 mg kg when administered subcutaneously.Further, certain of these compounds have been shown to retain their high potency as inhibitors or gastric acid secretion in rats when administered orally. In this test system one compound was round to be the most effective during oral administration. 2 2 Pyrldinylmethyl sulfinyl 1H benzimidazole 1 methanol, acetate ester compound 1 ofTable I exhibited an ED50 in the rat gastric antisecretory assay, administered orally, of 5 mg kg, which is the same ED50 exhibited by this compound during subcutaneous administration. In the test for in vivo inactivation of H K ATPase in the rat, 2 4 ethylthio 3 methyl 2 pyridinylmethyl sulfinyl 1H benzimidazole 1 carboethoxy ester 2 C 4 ethyl thio 3 methyl 2 pyri dinylmethyl sulPinyl1 1 H benzimidazole 1 carbophenoxy ester and 2 t 4 ethylthio 3 methyl 2 pyridinylmethyl sulfinyl 1 benzimidazole 1 carbo p nitrobenzyloxy ester were shown to be effective, having EDSO s of between 5 and 10 mg kg when administered suboutaneously. Further, certain of the compounds Of this invention were shown to be effective in a standard laboratory test ror gastric acid secretion in isolated rabbit glands.The two compounds that were the most effective as inhibitors or gastric acid secretion in this test were 2 4 ethylthio 3 methyl 2 pyridinylmethyl sulfinyl 1H benzimidazole 1 carboisobutyloxy ester and 2 E 4 ethylthio 3 methyl 2 pyridinylmethyl sulfinyl 1H benzimidazole 1 carbovinyloxy ester. Both of these compounds exhibited ID50 s of 10 mg kg in this test. In general, the preferred compounds of this invention are those of the formula I wherein A and B are hydrogen, X is SO, D is a substitutent of the formula II wherein V is S or V wherein R2 is alkylthio , and G is Cl C4 alkyl or COR6. All of the compounds of this invention are useful as gastric antisecretory agents. Compounds or this invention are administered for gastric antisecretory purposes orally, parenterally, e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intraparenterally , rectally, or vaginally in forms such as pills, capsules, solutions, suspensions, suppositories, or bougies. The compounds or this invention are formulated into these pharmaceutical compositions by means known to the pharmaceutical art. An ordinarily skilled physician can readily determine persons suffering from gastrointestinal diseases characterized by the gastricacid induced effects noted above. These conditions are treated using the compounds of the present invention. Typical dose ranges for the compounds of this invention range from about 0.01 wg per kg to about 250 mg per kg, preferably from about,0.1 to 100 mg per kg. The choice of the use, route, and frequency of administration or the compounds of this invention depends on the weight, age, and gastrointestinal disease of the patient and the particular compound employed. These decisions are readily made by a physician of ordinary skill in the art. The compounds of this invention may also exert cytoprotective effects. If employed for this purpose, they could be administered as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. 4,359,965, particularly cols. 7 and 8 thereof. The doses employed for this purpose would in general be less than those used for gastric antisecretory effects. The compounds of the present application are prepared by the methods of Charts A D. In the Chart A, G is all of the definitions ofG except hydrogen, G2 is C1 C4 alkyl, and all other variables are as defined above. In Chart A, a benzimidazole compound or the Formula A 1 is hydroxymethylated by means known in the art, e.g., treatment with formaldehyde in acetonitrile see Varma, et al., Eur. J. Med. ChemO 380 and Haugwitz, et al., J. Med. Chem. 22 1113 1979 . The benzimidazole compounds of the Formula A l are known and or can be prepared by the methods described U.S. Patents 4,045,5o3 4,255,431 and 4,337,257 and in published European patent applications 0130729 published 9January 1985 and 0150586 published 7 August 1985 , all of which are incorporated by reference herein. The compounds of the present invention wherein G is hydrogen, COR6, COPhX, CO CH2 mC02R3, or COCH2PhX are prepared as depicted inChart A. The Formula A 2 hydroxymethyl compound in pyridine is then treated at 20 50 C, preferably at 250 C with slightly more than one molar equivalent of the appropriate acid anhydride and a catalytic amount ofN,N dimethylaminopyridine or reacted in acetone at 20 50 C preferably at 250 C with one molar equivalent of the appropriate activated acid e.g., prepared in situ from an acid, isobutylchloroformate and triethylamine for 1 2 hours to yield an ester of Formula A 3. The final product can be purified by silica gel chromatography using common organic solvents, such as ethyl acetate or ethyl acetate hexane solvent mixtures for the eluent. The acids corresponding to G are well known and readily available to those skilled in the art and or may be prepared by known means.When X is S, this compound is then oxidized as described in the U.S. patents and applications noted above e.g., using meta chloroperbenozic acid to yield the corresponding sulfoxide. When the acid used is an amino acid, the amino function is blocked by conventional means e.g., using a tertiary butyloxy carbonyl group prior to reaction with the Formula A 2 compound. Such protected amino acids are also commercially available. The blocking group is then removed by reaction with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid to form an acid addition salt.Thus, for example, the Formula A 2 hydroxy compound is reacted with the t butyloxycarbonyl amino acid of the Formula A 2 in the following manner. The Formula A 2 compound and N,N dimethylaminopyridine DMAP are dissolved in dry pyridine. Separately, dicylohexylcarbodi imide DCCD and a t butyloxycarbonyl amino acid are dissolved in pyridine.These two pyridine solutions are slowly mixed together with continuous stirring. Dicyclohexylurea DCHU is formed as a by product and is filtered off. After the solvent is evaporated, the compound of theFormula A 3 thus formed is reacted with an acid of the formula HX to yield the Formula A 4 compound. Alternatively, the amino acid side chains within the scope of G may be added through a tmixed anhydrlde route. A t butyloxycarbonyl amino acid and N methylmorpholine are dissolved in dry tetrahydroturan THF . To this solution, isobutylchloroformate is added dropwise under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the precipitates which form are filtered off, a mixture of a compound of the Formula A 2 and dimethylaminopyridine DMAP in dry THF is added. After 60 minutes at room temperature, the reaction mixture is dried under vacuum. If necessary, the pure product is isolated by means of liquid chromatography. The final product is then prepared as described above. The compounds of the present invention where m is zero and G is C O O R11 are prepared as described in Chart B. In Chart B, a benzimidazole compound of the Formula B 1 in dimethyliormamide is treated at from 20 50 C, preferably at 250 C with one molar equivalent of sodium hydride. After stirring a few minutes at this temperature, the appropriate chloroformate reagent slightly more than one molar equivalent of the formula ClCOORl1 is added to the benzimidazole aminon and the reation is allowed to proceed at from 20 500 C, preferably at 250 C for 15 30 minutes. A pure compound of the Formula B 2 is then isolated by silica gel chromatography ethyl acetate or ethyl acetate hexane solvent mixtures as eluents and or by crystallization from ethyl acetate or ethyl acetate ether solvent mixtures. The benzimidazole compounds of the Formula B l are known and or can be prepared by the methods described in U.S. Patents 4,045,563 9,255,431 and 4,337,257 which patents are incorporated herein by reference, and in published European patent applications 0130729 published 9 January 1985 and 0150586 published 7 August 1985 . The chlorotormates of the formula ClC O O R6 are well known, readily available compounds and or can be prepared by known methods. In Chart C, a benzimidazole compound of the Formula C i in dimethylformamide is treated at from 20 to 500 C, preferably at 25O C with one molar equivalent of sodium hydride. The resulting benzimidazole anion is then allowed to react with slightly one than one equivalent of a halo ether of the formula CH3CHX O R12, wherein X is chloro or bromo and R12 is C1 C4alkyl, and the reaction is stirred at from 20 500 C, preferably at 250 C for 15 30 minutes. A pure compound of the Formula C 2 is then isolated by silica gel chromatography using ethylacetate hexane solvent mixtures as the eluent and or by direct crystallization rrom common organic solvents, such as ethyl acetate or ethyl acetate ether solvent mixtures.The chloroalkyl alkyl ethers are commercially available or readily prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. Ester derivatives of the present invention wherein R10 is other than hydrogen are prepared as depicted in Chart D. In Chart D, a benzimidazole compound of the Formula D 1 in acetonitrile is allowed to react at 250 C with 2 3 equivalent of an appropriate a haloalkyl ester.The a haloalkyl esters can be obtained from the corresponding acyl halides and an aldehyde Esee, L.H. Ulich and R. Adams, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 43, 660 1921 . For better yields in the reaction, the bromoalkyl esters are the more preferred a haloalkyl ester reagents.

Concentration of the solvent in vacuo gave the crude product which was chromatographed with silica gel using methylene chloride acetone 6 1 as the eluent to yield 91 mg of the title compound mp 123I24O C, recrystallized from Skellysolve B ethyl ether solvent mixture.Example 29 General Procedure for the Oxidation of Thioether Derivatives To a magnetically stirred solution of thioether in chloroform 0.1 0.2 M , cooled in a 0 5 C ice water bath, is added 1.0 1.1 equivalents of meta chloriperbenzoic acid. Stirring is continued at 0 5 C ror 15 20 min. The reaction is diluted with chloroform and the chloroform solution is then successively washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, 10 sodium sulfite, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, saturated brine and dired through anhydrous sodium sulrate. The coloroform solvent is removed in vacuo and the crude product purified by silica gel chromatography. Elution with methyl acetate or solvent mixtures, such as ethyl acetate methanol, acetone Skellysolve B, yields the pure product.
