## Description
Gear speed variator of epicyclic kind The presente invention relates to a gear speed variator of e picyclic kind, which allows a fine and continuousss variation of the transmission ratio. There are known many kinds of gear speed var.i.ators, among which there are those with epicyclic gear train. Practically all the known variators are therefore able to assure the choice a mong prefixed and precise transmission ratios, but not the fine and continuous variation of the transmission ratio between a mi niniiim and a maximum value, as it could be desired for many ap plicat.i.ons. The object of the present invention is therefore to realize a gear speed varicator of epicyclic kind, which allows to change the transmission ratio in a fine and continuous way, in order to mcake it assume any desired value inside a very wide variabi lity field. According to the invention such an object has been reached by means of a speed variator of epicyclic kind, comprising a first shaft and a second shaft coaxially disposed and respectively integral with a central pinion and with a peripheral internally toothed ring gear disposed one inside the other, said pinion and said ring gear being mechanically interconnected by at least two planetary gears housed in the annular space between said pinion and said ring gear and supported in a freely rotating way by a planetary gear support which rotates coax.ial ly with said shafts, and there being provided braking means for said gear support, characterized in that said braking means comprise a plap for liquids driven by said gear support and in sorted in a llydraulic circuit and a variable neck inserted in the delivery of said pump. It is evident that the association of a pump for liquids for example with gears or piston and of a variable neck to the rota ting support of the planetary gears of an epicyclic mechanism, such as the above mentioned one, makes possible the braking of the same support in a finely and continuously variable way in a very large field.In fact, if the neck is completely open, the pump is free to deliver the maximum liquid delivery and consequently the gear support is let free to rotate under the thrust given by the central pinion to the planetary gears and therefore to the gear support the result is that the planetary gears carry out a free revolution movement around the central pinion without giving any movement to the peripheral ring gear, which consequently remains stopped, that is the transmission ratio is 0.On the contrary, if the neck is completely closed the in compressibility charactenstics of the liquid of the hydraulic circuit for example oil cmlce the lock of the pump and consequently of the gear support in such case the planetary gears make only a rotatory movement around their own axes, as a result of which the peripheral ring gear in its turn rotates, in the opposite sense with respect to that of the pinion, with a maximum transmission ratio which depends only on the number of the teeth of the several gears engaged with each other.Finally, in the intermediate situations, that is with the neck partially o pen, the pump is partially braked and the gear support is par tially braked too as a consequence, the planetary gears carry out a combined movement of rotation and revolution, from which there results a rotatory movement of the peripheral ring gear with a transmission ratio at a middle value betwwen o and the maximum. From all of this it is clear that the transmission ratio of the speed variator according to the invention depends only on the adjustment of the variable neck and, as this latter can be adjusted in a fine and continuous way according to the operator desires, the transmission ratio can evidently be changed in a similar fine and continuous way. The characteristics and the advantages of the present i.nven tion will be made more evident by the following detailed description of an embodiment Llusstrated by way of non limitative example in the enclosed drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows a speed variator according to the invention in axiaL section Fig. 2 shows said speed var.iator in frontal view from left with respect to Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows the brakage system of the gear support of said variator in section along line III III of Fig. 1. The speed variator illustrated in the drawings comprises two coaxial hollow shafts 1 and 2, the first one of which is rotata bly inserted in the second one and the second one is rotatably supported by base elements 3 by means of bearings 4. One end of the inner shaft 1 the right one looking at Fig.1 integrally carries a gear S destined for receiving the inlet rotatory movement and the corresponding end of the outer shaft 2 integrally carries another gear 6 destined for the transmission of the outlet rotatory movement. The other end of the shaft 1 is in its turn shaped as a pi nion 7 and the corresponding end of the shaft 2 enlarges in its turn so as to form a peripheraL internally toothed ring gear 87 inside of which the above mentioned opinion 7 is centrally loca ted. The pinion 7 and the ring gear 8 are mechanically connected to each other by a pair of planetary gears 9 of double diameter with respect to the pinion 7 inserted in the annular space defined between said pinta and said ring gear and with these lat ter in toothed engagement. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the two planetary gears 9 are ro tatably mounted on respective rotation pins 10 made integral with a gear support ann 11 integral in its turn with one end of a central pin 127 which is rotatably housed and supported inside the shaft 1. On the other end of the above mentioned pin 12 is on the o ther hand rixioted one l3 of the two gears 13 and 14 this lat ter idle of a gear pump 15, which is inserted in a hydraulic circuit 16 schematically represented in Fig. 3 and presents at its delivery a variable neck 17 also schematically and con ventionally represented in Fig. 3 . The pump 15 and the variable neck 17 constitute the adjustable braking system of the gear support 11. In the operation, the maximum transmission ratio of the inlet shaft 1 to the outlet shaft 2 is obtained with the neck 17 completely closed. In such case, in fact, the delivery of the pump 15 is locked and with it the same pump 15 is locked, so that the gear support 11 is stopped and the rotation of the shaft 1 arrow A of Fig. 2 is transmitted through the planet ry gears 9 in mere axial rotation arrow B of Fig. 2 to the ring gear 8, which rotas in the sense of the arrow C of Fig. 2, and consequently to the outlet shaft 2. The transmission ra tio evidently depends on the number of the teeth of the several gears 7, 9 and 8 engaged with each other. On the contrary, the transmission ratio is zero, that is the ring gear 8 and the outlet shaft 2 remain stopped, if the neck 17 is completaly open. In such case, in fact, the oil circulat lon in the hydraulic circuit 16 is completely free and the pump 1 is therefore free to rotate at the speed given by the pin 12.The support gear 11 therefore is in its turn free to rotate, bringing the planetary gears 9. As a consequence of the rotation of the shaft 1, the planetary gears 9 therefore carry a revolution movement around the axis of the pin 12, rotating at the sa me time around their own axes but lett.i.ng stationary the ring gear 8. A possible intermediate situation between the two above explained can be obtained on the other hand by adjusting the neck 17, in a fine and continuous way, in a partial open condition for example as shown in Fig. 3 . By so do ing, the flow of the liquid pumped through the neck 17 is limited according to the used adjustment, and correspondingly the movement of the pump and consequently of the gear support 11 is braked. The result is that the planetary gears 9 are able to respond to the rotation of the pinion 7, and consequently of the inlet shaft 1, with a combined movement of rotation and revolution, from which the rzs arises for the ring gear 8 a rotation in the sense of the arrow C at a speed depending on the brakage of the gear support 11 and consequently on the adjustment of the neck 17.Since this latter can be adjusted in a fine and continuous way, it is evi dently possible to obtain transmission ratios correspondingly variable in a fine and continuous way. The precision in the de termination of the transmission ratio is in such case assured by the incompressibility of the chosen liquid for example oil . If required, while keeping inalteratod the rotation sense of the shaft 1, it is also possible to obtain an opposite rotation sense for the shaft 2. To this end it is sufficient to make in tegral for example through pins the shaft 1 and the pin 12 and to make maximlia the opening of the neck 17. The support shaft is thus allowed to rotate integrally with the shaft 1 at an angular speed which, being higher that that of the planetary gears 9 causes a slower rotation of the ring gear 8 in oppo site direction with respect to the normal one, that is in the sense of the arrow D in fig 2. Naturally that represented in the drawings is only one of the many possible embodiments of the speed variator according to the present invention. Many can be the variations, however comprised in the limits of the invention. Particularly, for example, the diameters of the gears 7, 9 and 8 can change among large limits, the pump 15 cant he of the gear kind and the neck 17 may have several more or less refined shapes Besides there can be provided for the neck 17 a manual as schematically represented in Fig 3 or automatic dependent upon the services required to the speed variator or still semi i omatic control. However it must be clear that all the above mentioned variations are included in the spirit and in the object of the invention, as defined in the following claims.
