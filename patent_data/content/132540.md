## Description
Divisional application of 82 105 460.8 Antiviral compositions The present invention relates to antiviral compositions and, more particularly, to antiviral compositions which contain aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid derivatives or salts thereof which are effective for thFrapeutic treatment of various infectious diseases which are caused from viruses, for example, upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, Bronchitis and so on. Vaccines which have been use for viral diseases are slow acting and their utility is limitd only to preventive use.Moreover, since antigenicity of objective viruses often changes, the effect of vaccines have not been sufficient. Under these circumstances, the present inventors have carried out intensive studies to find out pharmaceuticals which have f2st acting therapeutic effects. As a result, the inventors.found out that aminosulfonyl halogenobenzoic acid derivatives meet the above recuirement, thus completed the present invention. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions having antiviral activity which contain aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid derivatives which are effective for therapeiitic treatment of various infectious diseases caused from viruses, such 25 upper respiratory infection, pneumonia, Bronchitis and so on. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method of treating virus diseases by said compositions Further objects and advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent during the course of the description with follows. The present invention relates to antiviral compositions which contain as an active component aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid derivatives of the formula I EMI2.1 wherein X denotes a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, Y denotes a hydrogen atom or a chlorine atom, R1 denotes a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R2 denotes a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an ethylgroup, an isopropyl group or a phenyl group, or R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom in the formula may form a morpholino group, and R3 denotes a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an isopropyl group, a n butyl group, or an allyl group, and the salts thereof. The compounds which are the main ingredients of antiviral compositions according to the present invention can be prepared as follows. Namely, halogenobenzoic acid is heated in chlorosulfonic acid to obtain. chlorosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid. Brit. 8961,137 Chlorosulfonylhalogenobenzoic acid thus obtained is reacted with an amine of the formula II EMI3.1 at room temperature in a solvent such as water, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, dic aloromethane, benzen and so on or in a mixed solvent of water with one of these organic solvents, in the presence of deoxidizing agent, for example, inorganic base such.as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium. bicarbonate and so on or an organic base such at triethyl amine, pyridine and so on, or usingEMI3.2 per se as deoxydizing agent. Aminosulfonylhalogenobenzoic ester can be prepared as follows Halogenoaminosulfonylbenzoic acid is heated in chlorothionyl to obtain halogenoaminosulfonyl benzoic chloride GB ps No. 915,259 . Halogenoaminosulfonylbenzoic chloride obtained in this way is reacted with an alcohol of the following formula III R4OH III wherein R4 has the same meaning as R3 excluding hydrogen atom.The reaction is performed at room temperature or under heating when necessary in a solvent such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, dichloromethane, and benzene.Alternatively, the alcohol showing the above formula III per se is used as a solvent.
