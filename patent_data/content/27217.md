# Process for dehydrogenation of 3 beta hydroxy steroids.

## Abstract
This invention relates to the dehydrogenation of 3 β hydroxy steroids, such as a mixture of soy sterols, to form the corresponding Δ⁴ 3 keto derivatives of the steroids. A supported nickel catalyst is used for the reaction and the two different hydrogen acceptors are used in the reaction. The hydrogen acceptors are a dialkyl ketone, such as methyl ethyl ketone, and an olefin, such as 1 hexene.
