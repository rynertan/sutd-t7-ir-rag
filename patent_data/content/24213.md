# Swing check valve.

## Abstract
A pipeline swing check valve 10 comprising a fabricated valve body 12 with a fabricated cylindrical hub member 26 welded therein. The clapper 38 is hinged, not to the body 12 , but directly to the hub member 26 or some part thereon so that it can be mounted and adjusted for proper seating without handling the entire valve 10 , and then installed with the hub member 26 as a unit.
