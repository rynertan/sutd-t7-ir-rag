## Description
The present invention relates to the antibiotic of the formula X 14889C There is further provided according to the present invention a fermentation process for the production of this antibiotic substance together with the isolation technique utilized to recover the compound X 14889C from the fermentation broth. European Patent Publication No. 88,446 also describes polyether antibiotics, namely antibiotics X 14873A, G and H. Antibiotic X 14889C of the present invention differs from the known antibiotic X 14873A in three structural features, and from the known antibiotics X 14873G and H in four significant structural features, around the periphery of the molecule. The organism producing the compound of formula I is a new species designated Streptomyces sp. X 14889. A culture of the living organism given the laboratory designation X 14889 has been deposited on July 11, 1983 at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Northern Regional Research Laboratories, Peoria, I11, and added to its collection of microorganisms as NRRL 15517. The culture most closely resembles Streptomyces sparsogenes. A representative strain of Streptomyces X 14889 has the following characteristics Culture X 14889 grows in agar media of various compositions giving a type of growth characteristic of many aerobic actinomycetes. A substrate mycelium penetrates into the agar and remains unfragmented, while part of the aerial mass of growth differentiates into chains of spores. The chains are open to tight spirals and include more than 10 spores per chain. The spores are spiny and their average dimensions are 0.65 x 0.91 µm. Chromatographic analysis of whole cell hydrolyzates revealed the presence of LL diaminopimelic acid which, in addition to the properties listed above, suggests the assignment of strain X 14889 to the genus Streptomyces. The characteristics of growth in different agar media are summarized in Table 1 below. The data were recorded after 14 days of incubation at 28 C. Culture X 14889 can grow at the expense of glucose, galactose, fructose, arabinose, rhamnose, mannitol, sucrose and raffinose. There is no growth on xylose, inositol or cellulose, and slight or doubtful growth on salicin. Growth is inhibited by streptomycin. Melanin production in ISP 7 medium, H₂S production in ISP 6 medium, and nitrate reduction in ISP 8 medium are negative. Gelatin and casein are hydrolyzed but starch is not. The NaCl tolerance is low less than 2 . The phenotypic characters listed above for culture X 14889 allow the assignment of this culture to a group of Streptomyces species which have a marked resemblance with the strain under study according to phenotypic data reported in the literature. i.e., The species are S. albaduncus, S. canus, S. cuspidosporus, S. olivoviridis, S. craterifer, S. saraceticus and S. sparsogenes. S. albaduncus differs from 1 14889 in the utilization of xylose, inositol and sucrose S. canus utilizes xylose and inositol S. cuspidosporus grows on xylose, inositol and salicin S. olivoviridis is negative on raffinose and sucrose and is positive on xylose S. craterifer utilizes xylose and the utilization of sucrose and raffinose is doubtful S. saraceticus utilizes xylose, but the utilization of rhamnose is doubtful. S. sparsogenes is perhaps the species that more closely resembles X 14889. Neither organism sporulates well on selected media, and the utilization of sugars is similar with the exception of xylose, which is utilized by S. sparsogenes, and of galactose, for which this species is negative. Other differences include the fact that the individual spores in the spore chains of S. sparsogenes are indistinct, which suggests the presence of a sheath and the hygroscopic character of the spore mass. In summary, even though X 14889 resembles several other species of Streptomyces, the production of unique antibiotics and several physiological and morphological characteristics set it apart from all other species with which it has been compared. The species Streptomyces X 14889 described herein includes all strains of Streptomyces which form the compound of formula I and which cannot be definitely differentiated from the culture number X 14889 and its sub cultures including mutants and variants. The compound of formula I is identified herein and after this identification is known, it is easy to differentiate the strains producing the formula I compound from others. Streptomyces sp. X 14889, when grown under suitable conditions, produces the compound of formula I together with antibiotics X 14889 A, B and D. A fermentation broth containing Streptomyces sp. X 14889 is prepared by inoculating spores or mycelia of the organism producing the compounds X 14889 A D into a suitable medium and then cultivating under aerobic conditions. For the production of compounds X 14889 A D, cultivation on a solid medium is possible but for production in large quantities, cultivation in a liquid medium is preferable. The temperature of the cultivation may be varied over a wide range, 20 35 C, within which the organism may grow but a temperature of 26 30 C and a substantially neutral pH are preferred. In the submerged aerobic fermentation of the organism for the production of the compounds X 14889 A D the medium may contain as the source for carbon, a commercially available glyceride oil or a carbohydrate such as glycerol, glucose, maltose, lactose, dextrin, starch, etc. in pure or crude states and as the source of nitrogen, an organic material such as soybean meal distillers solubles, peanut meal, cotton seed meal, meat extract, peptone, fish meal, yeast extract, corn steep liquor, etc. and when desired inorganic sources of nitrogen such as nitrates and ammonium salts and mineral salts such as ammonium sulfate, magnesium sulfate and the like. It also may contain sodium chloride, potassium chloride, potassium phosphate and the like and buffering agents such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate or phosphates and trace amounts of heavy metal salts. In aerated submerged culturing procedures, an anti foam agent such as liquid paraffin, fatty oils or silicone compounds is used. More than one kind of carbon source, nitrogen source or anti foam source may be used for production of the compounds X 14889 A D. The following Examples will serve to illustrate this invention without limiting it thereto. The X 14889 culture is grown and maintained on a starch casein agar slant having the following composition grams liter distilled water The slant is inoculated with X 14889 culture and incubated at 28 C for 10 14 days. A chunk of agar containing the sporulated culture from the agar slant is then used to inoculate a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml sterilized inoculum medium having the following composition grams liter tap water The inoculated flask is incubated at 28 C for 72 hours on a rotary shaker, operating at 250 rpm. A 3 ml portion 3 , v v of the resulting culture is then used to inoculate a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml sterilized production medium having the same composition as the inoculum medium. The inoculated flask is incubated at 28 C for 6 days on a rotary shaker running at 250 rpm. The X 14889 culture is grown and maintained on a starch casein agar slant as described in Example 1. A chunk of agar containing the sporulated culture from the agar slant is then used to inoculate a 6 liter Erlenmeyer flask containing 2 liters of medium having the following composition in grams liter tap water The inoculated flask is incubated at 28 C for 5 days on a rotary shaker operating at 250 rpm. Four liters of the resulting culture is used as inoculum to start a fermentation in a 378 l fermentor containing 227 l of medium having the following composition grams liter tap water The inoculated medium is aerated with compressed air at a rate of 84 dm³ per minute and is stirred with agitators at 280 rpm. The fermentation is carried out at 28 C for 72 hours. 76 l of the resulting culture are then used to inoculate a 1890 l fermentor containing 1361 l of medium with the following composition grams liter tap water The inoculated fermentor is aerated with compressed air at 560 dm³ per minute and is stirred with agitators at 280 rpm. The fermentation is carried out at 28 C for 139 hours. The whole broth 360 gallons, 1368 liters from the 139 hour fermentation of Streptomyces culture sp. X 14889 was extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate at the harvest pH 7.1 . The solvent layer was separated and concentrated under reduced pressure to an oil. The oil was dissolved in n hexane and extracted twice with equal volumes of acetonitrile. The extracted hexane phase was concentrated under reduced pressure to an oil 70 g , dissolved in 1.5 liters of methylene chloride, and washed sequentially with 0.5 liters of 1 N HCl, water, saturated sodium carbonate and water. The solvent layer was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. This concentrate was chromatographed on a methylene chloride slurry packed 800 g silica gel Davison grade 62 column. The column was eluted with 4 liters of methylene chloride, followed by 4 liters diethyl ether hexane 9 1 . Fractions of 40 ml each were collected, and fraction numbers 60 120 were pooled and concentrated under reduced pressure to an oil 6 g . The oil was dissolved in minimum volume of methylene chloride and was chromatographed on a methylene chloride slurry packed 300 g silica gel Davison grade 62 column.

Structure was determined by X ray crystallography. Antibiotic X 14889C exhibits antimicrobial activity against a variety of organisms as indicated in the table below. As indicated above the antibiotic of the present invention and salts thereof possess the property of adversely affecting the growth of certain gram positive bacteria. They are useful in wash solutions for sanitary purpose as in the washing of hands and the cleaning of equipment, floors or furnishings of contaminated rooms or laboratories. When utilized as a disinfectent one skilled in the art should take into account the minimum inhibitory concentration of the antibiotic in computing the concentration of antibiotic to apply against the target organism. Antibiotic X 14889C also exhibits the following activities Based on the in vitro results above it may be hypothesized that administration of antibiotic X 14889C hereafter Antibiotic or Antibiotic Compound prevents and treats ketosis as well as improves feed utilization in ruminants or swine. The causative mechanism of ketosis is a deficient production of propionate compounds. A presently recommended treatment is administration of propionic acid or feeds which preferentially produce propionates. It is obvious that encouraging propionate production from ordinary feeds will reduce incidence of ketosis. Based on the However, the antibiotic can be usefully administered in other ways. For example, it can be incorporated into tablets, drenches, boluses, or capsules, and dosed to the animals. Formulation of the antibiotic compound in such dosage forms can be accomplished by means of methods well known in the veterinary pharmaceutical art. Capsules are readily produced by filling gelatin capsules with any desired form of the desired antibiotic. If desired, the antibiotic can be diluted with an inert powdered diluent, such as a sugar, starch, or purified crystalline cellulose in order to increase its volume for convenience in filling capsules. Tablets of the antibiotic are made by conventional pharmaceutical processes. Manufacture of tablets is a well known and highly advanced art. In addition to the active ingredient, a tablet usually contains a base, a disintegrator, an absorbent, a binder, and a lubricant. Typical bases include lactose, fine icing sugar, sodium chloride, starch and mannitol. Starch is also a good disintegrator as is alginic acid. Surface active agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate and dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate are also sometimes used. Commonly used absorbents again include starch and lactose while magnesium carbonate is also useful for oily substance. Frequently used binders are gelatin, gums, starch, dextrin and various cellulose derivatives. Among the commonly used lubricants are magnesium stearate, talc. paraffin wax, various metallic soaps, and polyethylene glycol. The administration of the antibiotic compound may be as a slow pay out bolus. Such boluses are made as tablets except that a means to delay the dissolution of the antibiotic is provided. Boluses are made to release for lengthy periods. The slow dissolution is assisted by choosing a highly water insoluble form of the antibiotic. A substance such as iron filing is added to raise the density of the bolus and keep it static on the bottom of the rumen. Dissolution of the antibiotic is delayed by use of a matrix of insoluble materials in which the drug is imbedded. For example, substances such as vegetable waxes, purified mineral waxes, and water insoluble polymeric materials are useful. Drenches of the antibiotic are prepared most easily by choosing a water soluble form of the antibiotic. If an insoluble form is desired for some reason, a suspension may be made. Alternatively, a drench may be formulated as a solution in a physiologically acceptable solvent such as a polyethylene glycol. Suspensions of insoluble forms of the antibiotic can be prepared in nonsolvents such as vegetable oils such as peanut, corn, or sesame oil, in a glycol such as propylene glycol or a polyether glycol or in water, depending on the form of the antibiotic chosen. Suitable physiologically acceptable adjuvants are necessary in order to keep the antibiotic suspended. The adjuvants can be chosen from among the thickeners, such as carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, and the alginates. Many classes of surfactants serve to suspend the antibiotic. For example, lecithin, alkylphenol polyethylene oxide adducts, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, and the polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters are useful for making suspensions in liquid nonsolvents. In addition many substances which affect the hydrophilicity, density, and surface tension of the liquid can assist in making suspensions in individual cases. For example, silicone anti foams, glycols sorbitol, and sugars can be useful suspending agents. The suspendable antibiotic may be offered to the grower as a suspension, or as a dry mixture of the antibiotic and adjuvants to be diluted before use. The antibiotic may also be administered in the drinking water of the ruminants. Incorporation into drinking water is performed by adding a water soluble or water suspendable form of the antibiotic to the water in the proper amount. Formulation of the antibiotic for addition to drinking water follows the same principles as formulation of drenches. The most practical way to treat animals with the antibiotic compound is by the formulation of the compound into the feed supply. Any type of feed may be medicated with the antibiotic compounds, including common dry feeds, liquid feeds, and pelleted feeds. The methods of formulating drugs into animal feeds are well known. It is usual to make a concentration drug premix as a raw material for medicated feeds. For example, typical drug premixes may contain from about 2.2 to about 880 grams of drug per kg of premix. The wide range results from the wide range of concentration of drug which may be desired in the final feed. Premixes may be either liquid or solid. The formulation of ruminant feeds containing the proper amounts of antibiotic for useful treatment is well understood. It is necessary only to calculate the amount of compound which it is desired to administer to each animal, to take into account the amount of feed per day which the animal eats and the concentration of antibiotic compound in the premix to be used, and calculate the proper concentration of premix in the feed. All of the methods of formulating, mixing and pelleting feeds which are normally used in the ruminant feed art are entirely appropriate for manufacturing feeds containing the antibiotic compound. As predicated on in vitro results, oral administration of the antibiotic benefically alters the production of propionates relative to the production of acetates in the rumen. It may therefore be postulated that the same treatment would also benefit monogastric animals which ferment fibrous vegetable matter in the cecum since it would be expected that a benefical change in the propionate acetate ratio would occur upon oral administration of the instant antibiotic. Horses, swine and rabbits are examplary animals which digest a part of their food by cecal fermentation. The incorporation of Antibiotic X 14889C into any of the dosage forms outlined above should be accomplished taking into account the Antibiotic X 14889C has the following toxicity expressed as LD₅₀ s Antibiotics X 14889 A, C and D are polyether antibiotics and form a variety of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These salts are prepared from the free acid form of the particular antibiotic by methods well known for compounds of the polyether type in the art for example, by washing the free acid in solution with a suitable base or salt. Examples of such pharmaceutically acceptable basic substance capable of forming salts for the purpose of the present invention include alkali metal bases, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the like alkaline earth metal bases, such as calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide and the like and ammonium hydroxide. Alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts suitable for forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts can include anions such as carbonates, bicarbonates and sulfates. Examples of organic bases forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with the polyether compounds are lower alkyl amines, primary, secondary and tertiary hydroxy lower alkylamines such as ethylamine, isopropylamine, diethylamine, methyl n butylamine, ethanolamine and diethanolamine. An amine especially preferred is N methylglucamine. Salts of N methylglucamine are of special value because of their water solubility which makes them amenable to parenteral use. Antibiotic X 14889C also exhibits slight
