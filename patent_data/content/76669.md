## Description
Novel 3 Phenyl 1 Indanamines, Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of PreparationThe present invention relates to novel 3 phenyl l indanamines which have pronounced psychopharmacological activity, especially thymoleptic activity and, at the same time, a low degree of undesired side effects, methods for the preparation of said indanamines, pharmaceutical compositions containing same, and methods for the treatment of psychic disorders, especially depressions, by administering a therapeutically active amount of one of said indanamines to mammals, including human beings.The novel Sphenyl l indanamines of the present invention are represented by the following formula EMI1.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 each represents hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkyloxy, hydroxy, lower alkylmercapto, cyano, trifluoromethyl, amino, acylamino, lower alkylamino or nitro, provided that R1, R2 and R3 may not represent hydrogen at the same time, R4 and R5 represent each hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkenyl, optionally substituted with hydroxy, optionally substituted cycloalkyl 3 6 C atoms or optionally substituted phenyl, R6 represents hydrogen or hydroxy, any hydroxy group present in the indanamine of Formula I being optionally esterified with an aliphatic carboxylic acid having from two to twenty four carbon atoms inclusive, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable ancid addition salts.Some l amino 3 phenylindanes have been described as analgetic , spasmolytic and coronary dilating agents see Adv.Drug Res. 4, 175 180 1967 .Recently, other l amino 3 phenylindanes have been described in German Offenlegungsschrift 2 339 715 as having tranquilizing properties.According to the present invention it has been found that the indanamines of FormulaI, as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, show a thymoleptic profile in test animals, such as rodents, and are very potent inhibitors of catecholamine uptake in vitro. They are active uptake inhibitors of both 5 hydroxytryptamine 5 HT , dopamine DA and noradrenaline NA . All these effects indicate good effectiveness in the treatment of depressions, especially endogenic depressions.The indanamines of Formula I exist as geometric isomers of the cis trans type, and the thymoleptic activity is found in both isomers, but often to a different degree. Each of the geometric isomers exists moreover as optically active isomers, and also these isomers may have the thymoleptic activity to a different degree.All the aforesaid isomers fall within the scope of the present invention.

As in vivo tests were used antagonism against tetrabenazine induced ptosis and potentiation of 5 HTP. All the tests show that the indanamines of Formula I have potentiating effects on both dopamine, noradrenaline and 5 HT neurones. In contrast, no effect is shown on the cholinergic neurone system.In more unspecific tests for antidepressant effect, like potentiation of apomorphine and antagonism against electro shock induced convulsions and antagonism against catalepsy induced by neuroleptics, the indanamines of Formula I do also show activity.The activity in the above outlined pharmacological tests indicates that the indanamines of Formula I would be valuable in the treatment of all kinds of depressions in mammals, including human beings, and are at the same time, due to the lack of anticholinergic effects, without the serious side effects inherent in known antidepressants.The tests may be described as follows Tetrabenazine ptosisMacrolon cages type IIMice, male, 18 25 gDosage and procedureThe test substance is given i.p. in the doses 0, 1 4, 1116 and 1 64 of the determined i.v. LD50 . For insoluble substances the doses 0, 1 8, 1 32 and 1 128 of i.p. LDfio l are used. 3 mice are used for each dose level. Thirty minutes after administration of test substance, tetrabenazine, 40 mg kg, is injected i.p. Ptosis is evaluated 30 minutes after administration of tetrabenazine, the following rating scale being used 0 normal eyes, 1 1 4 closed eyes, 2 1 2 closed eyes, 3 3 4 closed eyes and 4 completely closed eyes. Ptosis is evaluated 30 seconds after tilting the cage 3 times. The tilting is carried out in such a way that the animals slide along the floor of the cage.The results are recorded as inhibition of ptotic score calculated on the basis of the score of the control group. If ptotic score for the control group is 10 the test is rejected and another is performed. The registration can also be done as an on line procedure. 5 HT potentiationMacrolon cages type IIMice, male, 18 25 gDosage and procedureThe test substance is given i.p. or p.o. in the doses 10, 10, 2.5, 0.63 and 0 mg kg.Three mice are used for each dose level. One of the groups on the highest dose is used as control of the compounds own effect. If this group shows some of the symptoms mentioned below the test has to be repeated with lower doses of the test compound. Thirty minutes after administration of test substance, 5 HTP, 100 mg kg i.v. is given injection time 5 10 sec. . After this 5 HTP dose the animals remain unaffected. If the animals have been pretreated with a substance, which inhibits the re uptake of 5 HT, a 5 HTP syndrome will occur. This is characterized by the following symptoms 1 excitation, 2 tremor, and 3 abduction of the hind limbs.After the administration of 5 HTP the animals are observed for 15 minutes and each animal is given one point for eadi symptom present. Thus, the maximal score for a group consisting of 3 mice is 9.The results are stated as fractions 0 9, 1J9, 2 9 ..... 8 9, 919, where 0, 1, 2 .....8, 9 are the number of points per group after the dose in question.Inhibition of 3H 5 HT uptake in synaptosomes in vitro.Rats, 180 220 g 0.32 M sucrose containing 1 mM NialamideKrebs Ringer Phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 122 mM NaCl, 4.82 mM KCl, 972 uM CaCl2, 1.21 mM MgSO4, 12.7 mM Na2MPO4, 2.97 mM NaH2P04, 162 1uM EDTA Na2, 10.1 mM glucose, 1.14 mM ascorbic acid, oxygenated with pure oxygen 10 minutes before use Millipore filters HAXitPO 2500, 0.45 u hydroxy G 3H tryptamine creatinine sulphate 3H 5 HT, spc. act. app. 10 Cilmmol, The Radiochemical Centre, Amersham.Thomas Tissue Grinder, clearance 0.004 0.006 inch.

Results upon administration to human beings have been very gratifying.Most conveniently the compounds of Formula I are administered orally in unit dosage form such as tablets or capsules, each dosage unit containing the free amine or a non toxic acid addition salt of one of the said compounds in a amount of from about o.l0 to about 100 mg, most preferably, however, from about 5 to 50 mg, calculated as the free amine, the total daily dosage usually ranging from about l.o to about 500 mg. The exact individual dosages as well as daily dosages in a particular case will, of course, be determined according to established medical principles under the direction of a physician.When preparing tablets, the active ingredient is for the most part mixed with ordinary tablet adjuvants such as corn starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, or the like.When the compound of Formula I is an ester, preferably a decanoic acid ester, palmitic acid ester or a behenic acid ester, the composition may advantageously be an oily solution for injection, and such solutions often have a very prolonged effect when compared with the corresponding unesterified compound. Typical examples of formulas for composition containing trans N methyl 3 3,4 dichlorophenyl l indanamine called Lu 19 005 c for short as the active ingredient, are as follows 1 Tablets containing 5 milligrams of Lu 19 005 c calculated as the free base Lu 19 005 c 5 mg Lactose 18 mg Potato starch 27 mg Saccharose 58 mg Sorbitol 3 mg Talcum 5 mg Gelatine 2 mg Povidone 1 mg Magnesium stearate b5 mg 2 Tables containing 50 milligrams of Lu 19 005 c calculated as the free base Lu 19 005 c 50 mg Lactose 16 mg Potato starch 45 mg Saccharose 106 mg Sorbitol 6 mg Talcum 9 mg Gelatine 4 mg Povidone 3 mg Magnesium stearate 0.6 mg 3 Syrup containing per milliliter Lu 19 19005 c 10 mg Sorbitol 500 mg Tragacanth 7 mg Glycerol 50 mg Methyl paraben 1 mg Propyl peraben 0.1 mg Ethanol 0.003 mg ad are 4 Solution for injection containing per milliliter Lu 19 005 c SO mg Acetic acid 17.9 mg Sterile water ad l ml S Solution for injection containing per milliliter Lu 19 005 c 10 mg Sorbitol 42.9 mg Acetic acid 0.63 mg Sodium hydroxide 22 mg Sterile water ad 1 mlAny other pharmaceutical tableting adjuvants may be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredient, and additional compositions and dosage forms may be similar to those presently used for thymoleptics, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline or imipramine.Also combinations of the compounds of Formula I as well as their non toxic acid salts with other active ingredients, especially other neuroleptics, thymoleptics, tranquilizers, analgetics or the like, fall within the scope of the present invention.As previously stated, when isolating the compounds of Formula I in the form of an acid addition salt the. acid is preferably selected so as to contain an anion which is non toxic and pharmacologically acceptable, at least in usual therapeutic doses. Representative salts which are included in this preferred group are the hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, acetates , phosphates, nitrates, methanesulphonates, ethane sulphonates, lactates, citrates, tartrates or bitartrates, pamoates and maleates of the amines of Formula I. Other acids are likewise suitable and may be employed if desired. For example fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, succinic, salicylic, bismethylenesalicylic, propionic, gluconic, malic, malonic, mandelic, cannamic, citraconic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, benzenesulphonic, and sulphamic acids may also be employed as acid addition saltforming acids.When it is desired to isolate a compound of the invention in the form of the free base, this may be done according to conventional procedure as by dissolving the isolated or unisolated salt in water, treating with a suitable alkaline material, extracting the liberated free base with a suitable organic solvent drying the extract and evaporating to dryness or fractionally distilling to effect isolation of the free basic amine. The invention also comprises a method for the alleviation, palliation, mitigation or inhibition of the manifestations of certain physiological psychological aS normalies of animals, including depressions, by administering to a living animal body, including human beings, an adequate quantity of a compound of Formula I or a non toxic acid addition salt thereof. An adequate quantity would be from about o.ool mg to about 10 mg per kg of body weight in each unit dosage, and from about o.oo3 milligrams to about 7 milligrams kg of body weight per day.It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact details of operation or exact compound or compositions shown and described, as obvious modifications and equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art.
