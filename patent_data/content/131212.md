# Retaining wall for earth and similar materials.

## Abstract
The front face is formed by a series of prefabricated reinforced concrete panels 2 . In use, the prefabricated panels 2 are arranged vertically in side by side relation and rest on a concrete footing 8 cast in situ. The prefabricated panels 2 are rigidly connected to a concrete anchor bed 10 cast during the course of construction and which extends away from the prefabricated panels 2 towards the earth to be retained. The said concrete anchoring bed 10 is disposed at a level higher than the base of said panels 2 and is spaced from the latter by a distance of between 1 5 and Â½ of the total height of the said panels.
