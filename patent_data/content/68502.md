# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR RECOVERING THERMOPLASTIC FROM COATED FABRIC SCRAP

## Abstract
The invention relates to cryogenically cooling and impacting thermoplastic coated fabric to liberate the thermoplastic from the fabric and screening the resulting thermoplastic fabric mixture in a multi deck vibratory screener into a coarse fabric segment, a thermoplastic fines segment and a third segment. The third segment is separated into a fabric fines segment and a coarse thermoplastic segment in, for example, an air classifier. The recovered thermoplastic coarse and fines segments can be reused in all applications for regrind thermo plastic material.
