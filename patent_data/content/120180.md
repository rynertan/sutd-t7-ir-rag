# Magnetic disk loading ejecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A bucket 30 is so supported by a pair of supporters 54, 64 that it can move up and down, through vertical slits 60, 66 formed in the supporters 50, 64 and pins 40 formed on the bucket and entering the vertical slits. A guide member 80 can reciprocate horizontally, along one of the supporters 54 . The guide member has slanted slits 84 into which the pins on the bucket are individually fitted. When a cartridge is horizontally inserted into the bucket, a slider 42 moves forward in con junction with the cartridge, thereby rocking the interlocking body 100 retaining the guide member 80 , to disengage the guide member from the interlocking body. The guide member is moved in the cartridge retreating direction 3 by a tension spring 92 , and the bucket 30 is lowered by the joint action of the slanted slits 84 , the vertical slits 60 and the pins 40 . Thus, a magnetic disk engages with the shaft of a motor 26 . If an ejecting lever 110 is pushed in, the guide member 80 moves in the cartridge insertion direction 2 and the bucket 30 is raised by the action of the slanted slits, etc. Thus, the magnetic disk is disengaged from the motor shaft. At the same time, a stopper 142 is also raised, so that the cartridge 1 is retained by the stopper. If the ejecting level 110 is released, the stopper is then lowered, so that the cartridge is pushed out of the bucket by the slider 42 .
