# Image processing system.

## Abstract
An image processing system for use in an image verifica tion system for detecting and correcting distortion of an input image includes an image memory 7 for storing a digitized image before, during, and after correction. A working memory 8 temporarily stores intermediate data of the image on correc tion. Density level extension circuits 9 extend the density level or gradation of the image by repeatedly reading out the contents of the image memory and the working memory by using a matrix window containing picture elements of the image. A density slope detection circuit 10 detects the ex tended density level and calculates the density gradient by using the matrix window, and a correction circuit 11 corrects the density distribution and the line width of the image, based on the extended density level and the calculated density gra dient.
