# SELF CHECKING MICROPROGRAM CONTROL UNIT WITH ON LINE ERROR DETECTION CAPABILITY, IN MOS TECHNOLOGY

## Abstract
The control unit detects the errors concurrently with normal microinstruction execution through suitable internal checking circuits and a determined microinstruction alloca tion in the memory. Microinstructions comprise additional field CS, FS carrying the encoding, in modified Berger code, of the allocation address of the microinstruction itself and of the following one the microinstructions of destination itself and of the following one the microinstructions of destination of conditional jumps are allocated so that their codes are related to each other by simple logic relationships which are then reproduced by an internal circuit CSM the two fields, the one of the next microinstruction being duly delayed, are then compared and possible differences detect unidirection al and incorrect sequencing errors. The other errors are detected through particular imple mentations of some internal circuits STK1, INC1 and duplication of others RCT, SEL .
