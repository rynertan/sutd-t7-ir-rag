# Swivel snap hook of synthetic resin and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
In a swivel snap hook of synthetic resin, a unitary hook member 2 has a hook body 12 and a resiliently deform able closure tongue 13 molded integrally therewith, a free end 19 of the closure tongue 13 being, as the latter is in a free form, disposed inwardly of a free end 18 of the hook body 12 with a relatively small gap 14 therebetween. In use, as the closure tongue 13 is depressed inwardly against its resilience by a ring shaped article to be threaded onto the hook body 12 , the free end 19 of the closure tongue 13 is spaced wider from the free end 18 of the hook body 12 to open the latter. In production, the unitary hook member 2 is molded on a specific mold in such a state or condition that the free end 19 of the closure tongue 13 is disposed inwardly of the free end 18 of the hook body 12 with the small gap 14 therebetween.
