# NOVEL BENDROFLUMETHIAZIDE FORMULATIONS

## Abstract
New bendroflumethiazide formulations in solid form are provided which are characterized by excellent disintegration and dissolution capabilities even after long periods of storage. The new bendroflumethiazide formulations, for example, in the form of tablets, are formed of one or more excipients and a dry granulation containing one or more fillers, such as lactose and starch, and a preformed partial coprecipitate of bendroflumethiazide and a wetting agent therefor, such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone which converts the bendroflumethiazide into a more hydrophilic form.
