# Measurement of physical properties of the solid component of a slurry.

## Abstract
A physical property of the solid component of a slurry, for example the percentage content of a selected element such as iron, is continuously measured. A sampling device 2 carrying a filter element is immersed in the slurry at a sampling station A . Vacuum is applied to the sampling device 2 to cause the liquid content of the slurry to pass through the filter element, leaving the solid component deposited on the filter element as a filter cake. The sampling element is transferred to a heating station 8 , where the filter cake is dried, and then to a measuring station C , where the desired physical property is measured. The sampling device is then transferred to a washing station D , where the filter cake is washed from the filter element so that the procedure can start again. The process is automatically controlled by a microprocessor, enabling continuous sam pling of the slurry to be carried out.
