# A method for joining insulated conduits.

## Abstract
A method for joining insulated conduits 1 is disclosed, in which the bared ends 2a of the medium carrying pipes 2 are first interconnected in a per se known manner and a union piece 3 is thereafter placed around the resulting joint 2b , such that the union piece has an overlap on the outer side 2c of the conduits to be joined and forms a mould for foaming an insulating material of cellular plastic in the joint 2b . The union piece is a relatively rigid, circumferenti ally resilient plastic tube which is slotted throughout its entire length and, before being applied around the joint, has an inner diameter which is smaller than the outer diameter of the conduits 1 . After the union piece has been applied around the joint, a strip 4 is placed on the slot 3a of the union piece throughout substantially the entire length of the slot, said strip 4 consisting of a mouldable, curable plastic material which by curing is bondable to the union piece, and which is thereafter cured so as to be bonded to the union piece.
