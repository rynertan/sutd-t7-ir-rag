# Conveyor belt and method of making same.

## Abstract
A flat belting 10 includes a plurality of individual layers of fabrics 15, 16, 17 that extend throughout the length and width of the belting. The layers are joined together by reinforcing elements 28 which extend substantially in the direction of the thickness of the belting. The individual layers 15, 16, 17 and reinforcing elements 28 are encapsulated in a matrix of polymeric elastomeric resin, 22 for example, polyvinyl chloride. The individual layers 15, 16, 17 are saturated with a liquid elastomer forming polymeric resin 22 prior to their being joined together. The reinforcing elements 28 may be inserted, for example, by tufting, sewing, or stitch bonding. One or more of the individual fabric layers 15, 16, 17 may be a woven or other cloth having a plurality of substantially parallel yarns which extend in the lengthwise direction of the belting 10. One or more of the individual fabric layers 15, 16, 17 may be a non woven fabric.
