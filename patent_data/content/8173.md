# Large diameter dust guard for a locomotive axle bearing.

## Abstract
The axial gap between the rotatable hub 25 of a railroad locomotive wheel 14 and the relatively stationary thrust flange 21 of an adjacent axle bearing 12 is cover ed by a dust guard comprising an annular band 16 of elastomeric material firmly secured to the circumference of the thrust flange and having a portion 38 that overlaps the wheel hub to cover the axial gap. On the inside circum ference of the overlapping portion 38 there is attached a felt tape 18 that slidingly engages the hub to form a seal. The overlapping portion 38 is encircled by a large diam eter hose clamp 40 that enables a desired amount and no more than said desired amount of radial pressure to be applied substantially uniformly around the felt tape. This improves the effectiveness of the seal in resisting entry of dirt into the axial gap.
