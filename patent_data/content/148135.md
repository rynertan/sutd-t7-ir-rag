## Description
The present invention relates to a TEA laser apparatus with corona discharge preionization and high speed replacement of the laser gas between two successive discharges which apparatus is particularly suited for sealed off operation. In EP A 0096899 a method has been disclosed for providing a pulsed gas laser particularly suited for sealed off operation wherein corona surface discharges are used for producing a preionization by UV radiation. The apparatus of said application comprises a dielectric material tube within which the laser discharge electrodes are located facing each other. On the dielectric tube outer surface a metal layer is deposited or applied which is connected to one of the discharge electrodes. By rapidly applying a pulsed electric field, corona surface discharges are produced on the inner surface of the dielectric tube whereby UV radiation is emitted which preionizes the gas between the electrodes. By this way a laser has been obtained with good discharge stability while having simple and then low cost structure. Howewer the employment of the laser as above described suffers from the limitation that it cannot be operated at pulse repetition frequencies higher than a few pulses per second. In fact, as factually ascertained, a proper operation of a gas laser is achieved only when all the gas within the laser space is removed after each pulse discharge before supplying a fresh volume of gas into the laser space, the term fresh being used here to signify a gas mixture complying with the physical and chemical values as specified for the laser proper operation. According to an embodiment of the present invention as claimed in claim 1 the means for replacing the used gas with a fresh one comprises an outer cylindrical shell wherein the laser active components are enclosed together with an inner cylindrical shell the axes of the two shells being parallel but not coincident whereby an eccentric sealed space is defined between them which communicates with the laser active space and wherein the units are received for circulating within said sealed space the exhausted gaseous mixture from the laser space and supplying it again into the same after restoring the thermal and chemical characteristics of the mixture by means located within said eccentric space. According to the above cited application EP A 0096899 the two main discharge electrodes are enclosed in a dielectric material tube which is sheathed by a continuous wall of conducting material connected with one the main discharge electrodes and more specifically with the so called non stressed electrode. On the other hand, according to the present application, the tube in which the electrodes are enclosed has a wide longitudinal aperture through which the non stressed electrode unobstructedly faces the tube inside, two wide slits being left between each of the electrode longitudinal edges and the respective edge of the tube aperture for feeding the laser gas from said eccentric space into the laser space and for exhausting it again into the same eccentric space. In order to not obstruct said slits the conducting layer of EP A 0096899 has been replaced according to this invention with a conductive grid. Stable and homogeneous glow discharges can be obtained with this arrangement in spite of the wide longitudinal aperture of which the dieletric tube defining the laser space is provided. This has been proven by factual tests carried out with lasers having the structure outlined above. Based on this ascertainment, a laser gas recycling circuit has been designed according to this invention whereby a sealed off operation of the laser can be effectively realized. This invention will be better understood from the following description and attached drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment thereof given by way of example. With reference to the drawings the apparatus of this invention comprises a laser chamber 2 defined within a dielectric material cylindrical tube 4 a sector 16 of about 110 120 deg of the tube wall lacking a channel shape being thus imparted to chamber 2, which tube is contained and supported in a hollow prismatic structure with rectangular cross section the opposite upper 6 and lower 6 in Figs.1,2 walls being continuous while the other two 14 are limited to a short section from the respective ends of the prismatic structure to function as spacers for the other two walls all of said walls being made of dielectric material. The aperture 16 resulting from the lack of the 110 120 deg sector of the tube 4 wall is made to face the upper continuous wall 6 and the aperture edges are at a certain distance from the same wall whereby two slits are formed between said edges and wall. Along the bottom of the C channellike chamber 2 one of the two discharge electrodes, specifically the stressed electrode 8 extends which is energized through a lead 8 which crosses the continuous wail 6 at the centre of its surface. The non stressed main electrode 10 is located in a diametrically opposed position in front of electrode 8 the distance between its active surface and the axis of tube 4 being greater than the distance of the plane containing the edges of channelike chamber 2 from the axis of tube 4. Electrode 10 is excited through a lead 10 which crosses wall 6 at the centre of its surface. Tube 4 is wrapped within a conducting grid 12 connected with the feeding lead 10 of electrode 10 which grid from lead 10 extends first over the continuous wall 6 at both sides of said lead and then crosses wall 6 and follows the outer surfaces of both sides of tube 4 to reach on them the longitudinal lines corresponding within tube 4 to the edges of electrode 8. The prismatic structure by which the laser chamber is supported is contained in a hollow fluidtight cylinder 18 of which it occupies about one half of its volume the top half in Figs.1,2 . Within cylinder 18 a second cylinder 20 of smaller diameter is contained which is parallel but not coaxial thereto. The diameters of cylinders 18 and 20 are substantially different for instance, the smaller diameter can be about 0.6 the larger one with an eccentricity of about 1 10 of the larger diameter whereby a space 22 is formed which has its maximum width at its section diametrically opposed to the section where the prismatic structure is located which contains and supports the laser chamber. Cylinder 20 is almost totally occupied by said structure which is fitted thereinto through a wide longitudinal aperture of the cylinder, the side edges of wall 6 of the structure being made to contact the inner surface of cylinder 18 whereby the gas flow is prevented from flowing over the outer surface of the same wall but is compelled to flow in and out of chamber 2 through symmetrical passages 7,7 between either edge of said cylinder aperture and said wall 6. Passages 7,7 can be provided with guide vanes 9 for a smoother gas flow. A cooling unit 24 and a turbo fan unit 26 are received within space 22 for conditioning the gas flow and driving it in the direction of arrows F. The laser gaseous mixture is forced to enter the prismatic structure through said apertures 7,7 to reach the inside of chamber 2 through grid 12 and to vortically swirl therein. In addition to cooling unit 24 and turbofan unit 26 other units can be housed within space 22 for restoring the laser gaseous mixture to the starting values of its chemico physical characteristics . Such additional units may comprise for instance absorbant beds adapted for absorbing those molecules produced by the laser discharges and liable to change the chemico physical properties of the gaseous mixture or catalyst means adapted for recomposing those molecules which underwent dissociation due to the laser discharge. In Fig.1 the electric circuit diagram is shown of the apparatus. It comprises essentially a capacitor 30 across which the charging leads are connected through a power limiting resistor 31. Capacitor 30 connects with electrodes 8 and 10 through a quick switch 32 of the spark gap or thyratron type, the closing action of which is controlled by a pulse repetition frequency generator not shown. By closing switch 32 the preionization of gas within the laser chamber is produced by a corona discharge as indicated by the cross hatching 34 of Figs 1,2. The gas between electrode 8,10 is preionized by the UV radiation produced by the corona discharge. The apparatus of this invention has been operated by using as laser gas a CO₂ mixture with a repetition frequency greater than 100 pulses per second, the peak power output being 1 MW per pulse . A pumping arc free volume density has been attained of 190 Jl ¹ atm ¹ the active volume being 9 cm³ free from localized discharges 1 atm 1.01325 bar . The output volume density was 100 MWl ¹ atm ¹ and the output efficiency was 7.5 .
