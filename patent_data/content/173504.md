## Description
This invention relates to grease compositions comprising oil, hydroxy containing soap thickener and borated long chain alcohols, optionally containing phosphorus and sulfur moieties. Alcohols and mixtures of alcohols have been used as intermediates in the manufacture of a variety of lubricant additives, although the use of alcohols themselves as additives has not been widespread because of potential oxidative and thermal instability and volatility difficulties. However, some borated alcohols have been used in the past in commercial lubricant formulations to provide improvements in lubricating properties and have also, on occasion, been used in brake fluid formulations. For example, U.S. Patent 2,160,917 describes lubricants containing low molecular weight borate esters, for example borate esters containing from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, including the tributyl and trilauryl borates. Other patents include U.S. Patent 3,014,870 to mixtures of amine and certain boron mono and diesters U.S. Patent 3,108,966 aryl boron esters and thio acid ester lubricants U.S. Patent 3,133,951 fuels containing dialkyl boron esters U.S. Patent 3,347,793 tertiaryalkyl boron esters and U.S. Patent 3,509,054 esters of boron with 2,6 dialkyl phenols . In accordance with the invention, there is provided a grease composition containing a major amount of a grease and a minor amount of a compound prepared by reacting a long chain alcohol of the formula ROH in which R is a C₁₀ to C₃₀ hydrocarbyl group, with a boron compound, for example boric acid, boric oxide, metaborate or alkyl borate of the formula R¹O Preferably the alcohol is overborated, that is to say the borated product contains more than a stoichiometric amount of boron. R may be a linear or branched alkyl group, a cycloaliphatic group, an aralkyl group, an alkaryl group or a linear or branched group having at least one unsaturated bond an alkenyl group . Among the linear alkyl groups, the mixed C₁₀ to C₂₀ groups are preferred, with the more preferred being mixed C₁₂ to C₁₅ groups. Among those containing unsaturation, the oleyl and linoleyl groups, with members containing 15 to 30 carbon atoms, mixtures thereof and mixtures with saturated groups are preferred. Some of the alcohols that can be used for boration include dodecyl alcohol, tetradecyl alcohol, pentadecyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, octadecyl alcohol, isooctadecyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, mixed C₁₂ to C₁₅ alcohols and mixed C₂₀ to C₂₄ alcohols. The boron compound may be boric acid, boric oxide or an alkyl borate, preferably boric acid. The alkyl borates include the mono , di and trialkyl borates, such as the mono , di and trimethyl, triethyl, tripropyl, tributyl, triamyl and trihexyl borates. The reaction to form the borate ester can be carried out at from about 100 to about 260 C, preferably from about 120 to about 200 C. The temperature will depend for the most part on the particular reactants and on whether or not a solvent is used. In carrying out this reaction, it is preferable that quantities of reactants are chosen such that the molar ratio of alcohol to boron compound is from about 0.2 to about 2, preferably from about 0.5 to about 0.9. The alcohol can be reacted with an excess of the borating species to form a borate ester containing from about 0.1 by weight of boron to as much as 10 or more of boron. While atmospheric pressure is generally preferred, the reaction can be carried out under a pressure of up to 500 kPa. Furthermore, where conditions warrant, a solvent may be used. In general, any relatively non polar, unreactive solvent can be used, including benzene, toluene, xylene and 1,4 dioxane. Other hydrocarbon and alcoholic solvents, which include propanol and butanol, can be used. Mixtures of alcoholic and hydrocarbon solvents can be used also if desired. The times for the reactions are not critical. Thus, any phase of the process can be carried out in from about 1 to about 20 hours. A particular class of thickening agents is used to make the grease compositions of the invention. These thickening agents are those containing at least a portion of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal soaps or amime soaps of hydroxyl containing fatty acids, fatty glycerides and fatty esters having from 12 to about 30 carbon atoms per molecule. The metals are typified by sodium, lithium, calcium and barium, with lithium being preferred. 12 hydroxystearic acid and glycerides and esters containing 12 hydroxystearates, 14 hydroxystearic acid, 16 hydroxystearic acid and 6 hydroxystearic acid are the preferred acids and fatty materials. These thickeners need not constitute the total amount of thickeners in the grease compositions. Significant benefit can be attained using as little as about 15 by weight of the hydroxy containing thickener, based on the total thickeners. A complementary amount, that is up to about 85 by weight of a wide variety of other thickening agents can be used in the grease compositions of the invention. Included among the other useful thickening agents are alkali and alkaline earth metal soaps of methyl 12 hydroxystearate, diesters of a C₄ to C₁₂ dicarboxylic acids and tall oil fatty acids. Other alkali or alkaline earth metal fatty acids containing from 12 to 30 carbon atoms and no free hydroxyl groups may be used. These include soaps of stearic and oleic acids. These thickening agents can be produced in open kettles, pressurized vessels, or continuous manufacturing units. All of these production methods are commonly used for greases and have the necessary supporting equipment to process the grease during and after the manufacture of the thickener. Other thickening agents include salt and salt soap complexes as calcium stearate acetate U.S. Patent 2,197,263 , barium stearate acetate U.S. Patent 2,564,561 , calcium, stearate caprylate acetate complexes U.S. Patent 2,999,065 , calcium caprylate acetate U.S. Patent 2,999,066 , and calcium salts and soaps of low , intermediate and high molecular weight acids and of nut oil acids. Another group of thickening agents comprises substituted ureas, phthalocyamines, indanthrene, pigments such as perylimides, pyromellitdiimides, and ammeline, as well as certain hydrophobic clays. These thickening agents can be prepared from clays which are initially hydrophilic in character, but which have been converted into a hydrophobic condition by the introduction of long chain hydrocarbon radicals into the surface of the clay particles prior to their use as a component of a grease composition, for example by being subjected to a preliminary treatment with an organic cationic surface active agent, such as an onium compound. Typical onium compounds are tetraalkylammonium chlorides, such as dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium chloride, dimethyl dibenzyl ammonium chloride and mixtures thereof. An optional component of the grease compositions are phosphorus and sulfur moieties. Both of these can be present in the same molecule, such as in a metal or non metal phosphorodithioate of the formula In this compound, R² is preferably an alkyl group and may be a propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl or octadecyl group, including those derived from isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, sec butanol, 4 methyl 2 pentanol, 2 ethylhexanol, oleyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Further included are alkaryl groups such as butylphenyl, octylphenyl, nonylphenyl and dodecylphenyl groups. The metals covered by M include those in Groups IA, IB, IIA, IIB, VIB and VIII of the Periodic Table. Some that may be mentioned are lithium, sodium, calcium, zinc, cadmium, silver, molybdenum and gold. Non metallic ions include organic groups derived from vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, vinyl ethers such as butyl vinyl ether and epoxides such as propylene oxide and 1,2 epoxydodecane, as well as organic amines such as C₁₀ to C₂₀ hydrocarbyl amines including oleylamine and N oleyl 1,3 propylenediamine, diamines, imidazolines and oxazolines. The phosphorus and sulfur can also be supplied from the combination of two separate compounds, such as the combination of 1 a dihydrocarbyl phosphite having 2 to 10 carbon atoms in each hydrocarbyl group or mixtures of phosphites and 2 a sulfide such as sulfurized isobutylene, dibenzyl disulfide, sulfurized terpenes and sulfurized jojoba oil. The phosphites embrace the dibutyl, dihexyl, dioctyl, didecyl and similar phosphites. Phosphate esters containing 4 to 20 carbon atoms in each hydrocarbyl group, such as tributyl phosphate, tridecyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate and mixtures of such phosphates, can also be used. In accordance with the invention, the total thickener will contain at least about 15 by weight of a metal or non metal hydroxy containing soap, and the grease will contain from about 3 to about 20 by weight of total thickener, based on the grease composition. The grease composition also contains from about 0.01 to about 10 by weight, preferably about 0.1 to about 2 , of a borated alcohol, preferably prepared by reacting the alcohol with at least an equimolar amount of a boron compound. The composition may also contain from 0.01 to about 10 by weight, preferably from 0.2 to 2 by weight of phosphorus and sulfur containing compounds or a mixture of two or more compounds which separately supply the phosphorus and sulfur moieties. If separate compounds are used, an amount of the mixture equivalent to the required concentration is used to supply desired amounts of phosphorus and sulfur. It has been found that grease compositions according to the invention containing both the hydroxy containing thickeners and the borated long chain alcohols, have dropping points consistently and unexpectedly higher than those of greases derived from the same grease vehicles and the same borated long chain alcohols, but with different thickeners, for example non hydroxy containing thickeners. In general, the borated alcohols and the phosphorus and sulfur moieties may be employed in any amount which is effective for imparting the desired degree of friction reduction, antiwear activity, antioxidant activity, high temperature stability or antirust activity. In many applications, however, the borated alcohol and the phosphorus and or sulfur containing compound s are effectively employed in combined amounts from about 0.02 to about 20 by weight, and preferably from about 0.2 to about 4 by weight, based on the total composition. The grease compositions of the invention can be made from either mineral oil or synthetic oil, or mixtures thereof. In general, mineral oils, both paraffinic, naphthenic and mixtures thereof, may be of any suitable lubricating viscosity range, as for example, from about 45 SSU at 38 C to about 6000 SSU at 38 C, and preferably from about 50 to about 250 SSU at 99 C. These oils may have viscosity indexes ranging to about 100 or higher. Viscosity indexes from about 70 to about 95 are preferred. The average molecular weights of these oils may range from about 250 to about 800. In making the grease, the lubricating oil from which it is prepared is generally employed in an amount sufficient to balance the total grease composition, after accounting for the desired quantity of the thickening agent and other additive components. When synthetic oils are used, in preference to mineral oils, various compounds of this type may be utilized. Typical synthetic vehicles include polyisobutylene, polybutenes, hydrogenated polydecenes, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, trimethylol propane esters, neopentyl and pentaerythritol esters, di 2 ethylhexyl sebacate, di 2 ethylhexyl adipate, dibutyl phthalate, fluorocarbons, silicate esters, silanes, esters of phosphorus containing acids, liquid ureas, ferrocene derivatives, hydrogenated synthetic oils, chain type polyphenyls, siloxanes and silicones polysiloxanes , alkyl substituted diphenyl ethers typified by a butyl substituted bis p phenoxy phenyl ether, phenoxy phenylethers. The grease compositions according to the invention possess the advantages of increased dropping point and improved grease consistency properties and exhibit antirust characteristics and potential antifatigue, antiwear and antioxidant benefits unavailable in any known greases. The grease compositions of the invention have the additional advantage that they can be manufactured simply by mixing additive quantities of the alcohol borates to the fully formed soap grease after completion of sap onification. The following Examples illustrate the invention. Approximately 3032g of mixed C₁₂ C₁₅ alkanols obtained from Shell Chemical Co., and containing about 80 of linear alcohols comprising 17.7 of C₁₂, 30 of C₁₅, 28 of C₁₄ and 24 of C₁₅ alcohols, and having an average molecular weight of about 208 , 301 g of boric acid and about 250 g of butanol were charged to a reactor, and the contents were heated to about 155 C over a period of about 10 hours until water evolution ceased. The solvents were vacuum topped and the product was filtered hot through diatomaceous earth. A lithium hydroxystearate grease thickener was prepared by saponification of a mixture containing 12 hydroxystearic acid 8 by weight and the glyceride thereof 9 by weight with lithium hydroxide in a mineral oil vehicle ISO 150 viscosity grade of a 70 30 mixture of naphthenic and paraffinic stocks at about 175 C in a closed vessel. After depressuring and dehydration of the thickener in an open kettle, sufficient mineral oil was added to reduce the thickener content to about 9.0 . After cooling to 99 C, a typical grease additive package, consisting of an amine antioxidant, phenolic antioxidant, 1.5 zinc dithiophosphate derived from mixed C₃ secondary and C₆ primary alcohols, sulfur containing metal deactivator and nitrogen containing antirust additives, was added. Two weight percent of borated alcohol product of Example 1 were added to the base grease of Example 2 at about 110 to 115 C. A base grease was thickened with the lithium soap of a 50 50 by weight mixture of stearic and palmitic acids. The base grease of Example 2 and the base grease of Example 4 were mixed to form a 50 50 by weight mixture of hydroxy and non hydroxy thickeners. The base grease of Example 4 was mixed with 2 of the borated alcohol of Example 1. The grease compositions of Example 2 to 6 were tested in the ASTM D2265 Dropping Point Test. The results are shown in the Table.
