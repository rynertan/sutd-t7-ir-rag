# Applicators for pharmaceutically active agents, their preparation and use.

## Abstract
A disposable applicator for placing a pharmaceutically active agent in contact with a moist body surface, especially the eye, is in the form of an elongate strip disposed at one end of which is a soluble matrix element 3 containing the pharmaceutically active agent so that on contact with the moist body surface the matrix element 3 separates from the remainder 2 of the strip. In a preferred form the matrix element is attached to the remainder of the strip by a thin water soluble membrane 6 which rapidly dissolves in the body fluid thereby releasing the matrix element 3 to the body surface. Processes for the preparation of the disposable applicators are also described.
