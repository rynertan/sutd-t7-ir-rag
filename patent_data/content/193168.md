# Method of inspecting carburization and probe therefor.

## Abstract
A probe 16 comprises a magnet 20 and a Hall element 22 which are provided in a magnetically impermeable case 18 . The Hall element 22 is disposed at the midportion between the two poles of the magnet 28 in parallel with the lines of magnetic force. The presence of a carburized portion in the member to be inspected and the depth of carburization are detected by passing d.c. current across the Hall element 22 and detecting the Hall effect electromotive force produced between the two ends of the element which are opposed in a direction perpendicular to the direction of flow of the current.
