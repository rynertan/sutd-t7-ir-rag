# METHODS AND MATERIALS FOR SPLICING TUBULAR FOOD CASINGS

## Abstract
The tubular food casings and especially wet sausage casings are spliced together by means of splicing tape comprising cellulose backing coated with a saran polymer. The tape and joined casing sections are bonded by applica tion of controlled heat and pressure to form machinable and stuffable spices with exceptionally high peel strengths when wet.
