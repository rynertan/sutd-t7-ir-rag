# Method of and apparatus for thermally treating fiber yarns.

## Abstract
A bundle of fibers fed from a stuffer box longitudinally in a corrugated form is wrapped with a breathable heat resis tant fabric to form a continuous belt like shape and then in troduced into and drawn out of a thermal treatment region by the aid of inlet and outlet ducts and guide channel in a heat treatment chamber into which is supplied a heating medium comprising one of non condensable gas, superheated steam, and a mixture of said non condensable gas and said superheated steam. The chamber includes a high pressure portion and a low pressure portion disposed on opposite sides of the guide channel. The heating medium flows lon gitudinally along the inlet and outlet ducts in opposite direc tions towards outsides and transversely from the high pres sure portion to the low pressure portion across the guide channel, whereby the fibers wrapped with the breathable heat resistant fabric is thermally treated. The heating medium used for the thermal treatment is recirculated into the high pressure portion after having been pressurized and heated.
