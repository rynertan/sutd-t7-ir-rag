## Description
CROSSLINKED OLEFINIC BLOCK COPOLYMERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Art This invention relates to an olefinic block copolymer which has excellent strength, thermal stability and low temperature impact resistance as well as excellent appearance and processability.Prior Art Flexible materials excellent in strength and thermal stability and especially in low temperature impact resistance have been recently demanded in the field of interior trims of automobiles, exterior surfacing materials, household electric applicance parts, electric cables, pipes, various sheets, etc. As such soft or flexible polymer materials, there have been known plasticized polyvinylchlorides, ethylene divinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene a olefin copolymers, vulcanized rubbers, etc. Uses of these polymers, however, are restricted because of either inferior thermal stability inspite of their good low temperature impact resistance or poor cold resistance e.g. in the case of PVC . A random copolymer of propylene and other oleo in generally has excellent thermal stability in comparison with the above mentioned polymers. Such random copolymers, however, are short of flexibility and also inferior in low temperature impact resistance. These diverse properties may be somewhat satisfied, for example, by a polymer material which was derived by melt kneading a polypropylene and an ethylene propylene rubber or the like and as necessary partially crosslinking the rubber portions thereof in a meltkneading step. Such polymer materials, however, have been not attractive because of cost increase in the blending step. Incidentally, the term flexible material herein refers to JIS A hardness of 98 or less, and more strictly to JIS A hardness of 96 or less. The polymer materials as disclosed in Japanese Laidopen Patent Application No.53938 74, Japanese PatentPublication No. 34210 78, etc. have problems both in process and quality in that a the additional step of melt kneading renders a large increase in costs and b the qualities of the polymer material such as strength, thermal stability, tensile elongation and processability are not satisfactory because of insufficient molecular designs of component polymer materials. On the other hand, instead of mechanically blending a polypropylene and an ethylene propylene rubber, it has been proposed to produce the two components stepwise in a polymerization vessel by way of a two step polymerization process. The resulting block copolymer is advantageous in costs in comparison with the above mentioned mechanically blended polymer. As far as known by the present inventors, a block copolymer composed of propylene and ethylene having flexibility as aimed in the present invention is disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent No. 70014 81Specification. This block copolymer is composed of two polymer blocks. According to the present inventors test, however, the resulting copolymer is very inferior in high temperature properties and thus has narrow uses, although the properties thereof at ordinary temperature are fairly good. Moreover, when the copolymer was molded into injection molded articles, flow marks appeared on the surfaces of the articles and the commercial values thereof were much lowered. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In order to solve the above described problems without impairing flexibility of the conventional polymers, the present inventors have conducted extensive research and found that a novel cross linked polymer derived from block polymers, which had been obtained by linking the specified ratios of copolymeric blocks A ,. B and C having certain compositional ranges, has well balanced properties such as strength, thermal resistance, tensile elongation, processability, and appearance. Thus, the present invention has accomplished. A crosslinked olefinic block copolymer of the present invention is characterized in that the crosslinked copolymer is derived from an olefinic block copolymer comprising 1 to 60 parts by weight of a polymer block A selected from a propylene homopolymer block and a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block having ethylene content of not more than 4 by weight, 5 to 70 parts by weight of a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block B having ethylene content of more than 4 and less than 25 by weight, and 25 to 50 parts by weight of a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block C having ethylene content of 25 to 85 by weight and the resulting crosslinked copolymer contains a hot xylene insoluble component in the range of 0.2 to 40 by weight and has an NFR defined by ASTM D 1238 L of 0.01 to 100. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 1. Block Copolymer to be Crosslinked The block copolymer to be used in the present invention comprises 1 to 60 parts by weight of a polymer block A selected from propylene homopolymer block and a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block having ethylene content of not more than 4 by weight, 5 to 70 parts by weight of a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block B having ethylene content of more than 4 and less than 25 by weight, and 25 to 50 parts by weight of a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block C having ethylene content of 25 to 85 by weight. The block copolymer to be used in the present invention not only contains one each of the blocks A , B and C , but also can contain two or more of any blocks. Also, the arrangement of the blocks is not restricted, although the blocks are normally formed and arranged in the sequence of A B C . In such a block copolymer, a homopolymer or copolymer block having a certain composition and copolymer blocks having different compositions can exist in the form of a polymeric chain, or a physical mixture of these molecular chains, or a mixed state of these chains. In other words, the block copolymer is such a polymer that is produced by a step wise formation by polymerization of blocks in the presence of a previously produced block or blocks. The block contents in the present block copolymer are shown in the following Table.EMI4.1 tb SEP Content SEP SEP by SEP weight tb Block tb SEP General SEP Preferable SEP More SEP preferable tb SEP embodiment SEP embodiment SEP embodiment tb SEP A SEP 1 60 SEP 3 55 SEP 5 50 SEP tb SEP B SEP 5 70 SEP 7 65 SEP 10 60 tb SEP C SEP 25 50 SEP 27 50 SEP 30 45 SEP tb The block A is a high crystalline element and gives strength and thermal resistance to the block polymer. The properties are impaired when the quantity of the block A is less than the above defined range. When the quantity is more than the range, the properties of the block polymer caused by the blocks B and C are impaired. The block B has an intermediate composition between that of the block A and that of the block C , and serves to enhance compatibility between the blocks A and C . The block copolymer composed of the three blocks A B C gives a molded product of excellent appearance and exhibits good tensile properties. Thus, when the amount of the block B is less than the above defined range, the appearance of the resulting product is deteriorated. On the other hand, the properties caused by the blocks A and C are impaired when the amount is more than the range. The block C is amorphous or low crystalline, heatresistant element, and serves to give the resulting copolymer flexibility and low temperature impact resistance. These properties are impaired when the amount of the block C is less than the above defined range. On the other hand, the properties caused by the blocks A and B are impaired when the amount is more than the range. The block A is a propylene homopolymer or a random binary copolymer composed of propylene and ethylene, the monomer composition of which is shown in the following table.EMI5.1 tb SEP General SEP Preferable SEP More tb SEP embodiment SEP embodiment SEP preferable tb SEP embodiment tb SEP Ethylene tb SEP content SEP otto4 SEP otto3 SEP otto2 SEP tb SEP by SEP weight tb A smaller amount of the ethylene content in the above defined range can be employed, when the thermal resistance of the block polymer is important and a larger amount in the range can be employed when the flexibility is more important. The ethylene content, however, should be not more than the above defined range to maintain the required thermal resistance and strength. The block B is a random binary copolymer composed of propylene and ethylene, the monomer composition of which is shown in the following table.EMI6.1 tb SEP Generral SEP Preferable SEP More tb SEP embodiment SEP embodiment SEP preferable tb SEP embodiment tb SEP Ethylene SEP morethaneless SEP 5 SEP to SEP 20 SEP 6 SEP to SEP 18 tb SEP content tb by SEP weight SEP tb The block B serves to enhance the compatibility between the blocks A and C , and thus is considered to improve the appearance and tensile properties of the resulting molded product. The appearance and tensile properties are deteriorated when the composition of the block B is outside of the above defined range. The block C is a random binary copolymer composed of propylene and ethylene, the monomer composition of which is shown in the following table.EMI6.2 tb SEP General SEP Preferable SEP More tb SEP embodiment SEP embodiment SEP preferable tb SEP embodiment tb SEP Ethylene tb SEP content SEP i SEP 28 SEP to SEP 85 SEP 25 SEP to SEP 70 SEP 30 SEP to SEP 60 SEP tb by SEP by SEP weight tb The block C is a flexible and cold resistant element. The flexibility and low temperature impact resistance are deteriorated because of increase in isotactic polypropylene chains, when the ethylene content is less than the above defined range. On the other hand, when the ethylene content is more than the range, the low temperature impact resistance itself is satisfactory but the flexibility is impaired because of increase in polyethylene chains.2 Molecular Weight The molecular weight of the block copolymer is required to be within the range of 0.01 to 100 g 10 minutes of MFR ASTM D 1238 L . When the molecular weight is over this range, the mechanical strength of the copolymer fails to reach its practical level because of too low molecular weight. When the MFR value is less than the above mentioned range, the viscoelastic properties in a molten state are deteriorated and the molding also becomes impossible because of too high molecular weight.2. Preparation of the Block Copolymer The block copolymer to be crosslinked in the present invention can be produced by combined steps comprising a a step of forming 1 to 60 preferably 3 to 55, more preferably 5 to 50 parts by weight of a propylene homopolymer block or a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block having ethylene content of 0 to 4 preferably 0 to 3, more preferably 0 to 2 by weight, b a step of forming 5 to 70 preferably 7 to 65, more preferably 10 to 60 parts by weight of a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block having ethylene content of more than 4 and less than 25 preferably 5 to 20, more preferably 6 to 18 by weight, and c a step of forming 25 to 50 preferably 27 to 50, more preferably 30 to 45 parts by weight of a propylene ethylene random binary copolymer block having ethylene content of 25 to 85 preferably 25 to 70, more preferably 30 to 60 by weight. The above mentioned steps a , b and c can be carried out in an optional sequence, and is normally carried out in the sequence of a b c . Also, any one of the above mentioned steps can be divided into two or more sub steps, whereby diverse polymer blocks different in compositions can be prepared in the substeps. The stereospecific catalyst suitably used in the present invention is exemplified by a catalyst consisting essentially of a titanium component and an organoaluminum compound. As the titanium component can be used a titanium trichloride of a, , y or 8 type, or a titanium compound supported by a suitable carrier such as magnesium chloride, etc. Of the titanium trichloride, there can be used a specified titanium trichloride as the titanium component of the catalyst which was prepared by i reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound to obtain titanium trichloride presumably consisting essentially of a eutectic compound of titanium trichloride and aluminum chloride, ii removing by extracting the aluminum chloride by the use of a complexing agent, and iii activating the resulting titanium trichloride by a suitable treatment. In this case, a more rubber like block B can be obtained in comparison with the case where other titanium trichloride was used. In order to increase the yield per catalyst of the block copolymer, it is preferred to use titanium tetrachloride or titanium trichloride supported on magnesium chloride, etc. As the organoaluminum compound, desirably used is a compound represented by the general formula AlRaY3 a, wherein the symbol ga is an optional number of 0 a 3, Y is a halogen atom, and R is a hydrocarbon residue having 1 to about 18 carbon atoms which is preferably an alkyl group or an aryl group. More specifically, triethylaluminum, diethylaluminum chloride, etc. are preferably used. The catalyst comprising these two essential components can be incorporated with a small amount of an electron donor used as the third component. As the electron donor can be used an organic acid ester, an ether, an amine, an alcohol, a ketone, an aldehyde, a phenol, etc. Polymerization can be conducted in either a continuous process or a batch wise process. In the continuous process, one or more polymerization vessels are used for each of the steps a , b and c , and reactions are carried out in each vessel under stationary conditions, respectively. In the batch wise process, all or predetermined amount of the charged monomer s in each step is caused to react, and then the next reaction step is carried out. Alternatively, a predetermined amount of monomer s is caused to react, a part or all of unreacted monomer s is taken out of the vessel, and then the next reaction step is carried out. The polymerization is normally carried out at a polymerization temperature of 0 to 2000C and under polymerization pressure of 0 to 100 kg sq.cm gauge pressure , wherein some negative pressure gauge pressure is permissible. Hydrogen can be used to control the molecular weight of the resulting copolymer.It is also permissible that the concentration of hydrogen can be varied in each step to modify the molecular weight of a copolymer block produced in each step. The polymerization is normally carried out by a suspension polymerization system or a solution polymerization system in an inert hydrocarbon such as nheptane or n hexane. 3. Crosslinked Product of the Block Copolymer In the present crosslinked polymer. derived from the olefinic block copolymer, it is considered that the block portion mainly corresponding to the block C of the copolymer is involved in crosslinking, and the block portions corresponding to the blocks A and B scarcely involved in the crosslinking but serve to provide the resulting crosslinked copolymer with meltflow properties. It can be recognized by a gel fraction determined as hot xylene insoluble components explained below and anMFR that the present crosslinked product is satisfactorily crosslinked and is excellent in moldability. More specifically, the gel fraction of the present crosslinked product is 0.2 to 40 , preferably 0.5 to 35 , more preferably 1.0 to 30 by weight. The high thermal stability aimed in the present invention cannot be achieved when the gel fraction is less than the above mentioned range. On the other hand, the moldability is impaired when the gel fraction is over the range. The melt flow property of the present crosslinked product is 0.01 to 100, preferably 0.03 to 50, more preferably 0.05 to 30 in accordance with ASTM D 1238 L .When the melt flow property is less than the range, molding may be difficult. When the melt flow property is over the range, the gel fraction is generally lowered and the crosslinked product often fails to enhance its thermal stability.4. Production of Crosslinked Copolymer Conventional techniques can be employed to obtain the crosslinked products. For example, a mechanical melt kneading method can be typically employed. Thus, the block copolymer can be partially crosslinked in the melt kneading step by the use of a conventional melt kneading machine such as a monoaxial extruder, a biaxial extruder, a Banbury mixer, and a kneader. It is also possible to conduct the crosslinking by impregnation with a crosslinking agent or by application of heat or radiations. As the crosslinking agent can be used aromatic or aliphatic peroxides or azo compounds which act as a radical polymerization initiator. These agents can be used alone or as a mixture. In order to conduct the crosslinking efficiently, it is preferred to use an auxiliary crosslinking agent. Such auxiliary agents include, for example, sulfur, a bifunctional compound such as divinyl compounds e.g. divinyl benzene or diallyl compounds e.g. diallyl phthalate , oxime compounds such as p quinone dioxime or p,p dibenzoylquinone dioxime, etc. Also, useful as the auxiliary agent are an oligomer having double bonds in its main and side chains such as liquid 1,2 poybutadiene, and a polymer having double bonds in its main and side chains such as syndiotac tic 1,2polybutadiene. Specific examples of the crosslinking agent include 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 benzoylperoxy hexane, t butylperoxy perbenzoate, dicumylperoxide, 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di t butylperoxy hexane, t butylcumylperoxider diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, 1,3 bis tbutylperoxyisopropylbenzene, etc. In the crosslinking through the mechanical meltkneading step, the kneading temperature is in the range of 160 to 3000C, preferably 160 to 2500C, more preferably 160 to 2100C. When the kneading temperature is less than the above mentioned range, melting of the block copolymer becomes difficult. When the temperature is over the range, deterioration of the polymer or abnormal crosslinking takes place. Thus physical properties are markedly lowered. In order to conduct uniform crosslinking and control the crosslinking reaction, a crosslink reaction retarder can be used together as necesary in the mechanical meltkneading step. Such retarders include, for example, a scorch retarder for organic peroxide crosslinking such as hydroquinone, 2,6 di t butyl p cresol, t butylcatechol, 4,4 butylidene bis 3 methyl 6 t butylphenol , 2,2 methylene bis 4 methyl 6 t butylphenol , 4,4 thiobis 6 t butyl 3 methylphenol , mercaptobenzothiazolr dibenzothiazol disulfide, 2,2 ,4 trimethyl l, 2 dihydroquinone polymer, phenyl p naphthylamine, N,N di g naphthyl p phenylenediamine, and Nnitrosodiphenylamine. The present crosslinked product can be blended with fillers such as carbon or white pigment, process oil of paraffin or naphthene series, waxes, plasticizers such as dioctyl phthalate, dyes, etc. As necessary, it is also possible to add thereto other additives such as thermal stabilizers, antioxidants and ultraviolet absorbers. Incidentally in the crosslinking through the mechanical melt kneading step, it is sometimes effective for improving appearance of molded products to conduct a preliminary melt kneading step at least in the absence of the crosslinking agent. In the present invention, the MFR is determined according to ASTM D 1238 L at 2300C with a load of 2.16 kgs. The gel fraction content of hot xylene insoluble component, measure of the degree of crosslinking is determined by covering 1 gram of the sample with a stainless steel 80 mesh screen, placing it in a Soxhlet extractor, subjecting the specimen to extraction for 10 hours while hot p xylene is ref fluxed for about every 30 minutes, and obtaining the ratio of unextracted insoluble portion to the charged sample amount. Other test methods used for evaluation of products in the following examples and comparative examples are in accordance with the following standards, unless otherwise specified. 1 Hardness JIS K 6301 A l 2 Tensile Strength JIS K 6301 Kg sq.cm 3 Tensile Elongation JIS K 6301 4 Compression Set JIS K 6301Example 1 A stainless steel 200 liter reactor equipped with a stirring vane was sufficiently replaced with propylene gas and then charged with 80 liters of heptane used as a polymerization solvent.

Then, propylene and hydrogen were introduced at a rate of 9.1 kg hour and at a concentration of 2.5 by volume, respectively, when the temperature therein was raised to 600C. About 0.4 hour aftrer starting introduction of propylene, introduction of ethylene was started at a rate of 0.63 kg hour.The introduction of propylene, hydrogen and ethylene was terminated when the introduced amount of propylene reached 12.1 kgs. The reaction was continued until the pressure in the reactor decreased to 2.0 kg sq.cm, followed by purging unreacted gas until the pressure therein was lowered to a 0.2 kg sq.cm Iso far for blocks A and B The temperature in the reactor was raised to 650C, and propylene and ethylene were introduced for 3 hours at the rates of 2.30 kg hour and 1.18 kg hour, respectively, while the concentration of hydrogen was controlled to be 9.0 by volume so far for block C . Catalyst residues were removed by adding 2.1 liters of butanol to the resulting block copolymer slurry, treating the mixture at 600C for 3 hours, sufficiently contacting the mixture with water, and then separating the water layer. The slurry was subjected to steam stripping and then to drying to obtain the block copolymer.

The introduction of propylene, hydrogen and ethylene was terminated when the introduced amount of propylene reached 14.4 kgs.The reaction was continued until the pressure in the reactor decreased to 2.0 kg sq.cm, followed by purging unreacted gas until the pressure therein was lowered to 0.2 kg sq.cm so far for blocks A and B . The temperature in the reactor was raised to 650C1 and propylene and ethylene were introduced for 2.2 hours at the rates of 1.50 kg hour and 1.54 kg hour, respectively, while the concentration of hydrogen was controlled to be 20 by volume so far for block C .

A sheet was then produced.Properties of the resulting sheet are shown in Table 1.Example 6 A stainless steel 200 liter reactor equipped with a stirring vane was sufficiently replaced with propylene gas and then charged with 80 liters of heptane used as a polymerization solvent. The reactor was then charged with 30 g of DEAC and 8.0 g of titanium trichloride while the temperature therein was kept at 550C. Then, introduction of propylene and hydrogen was started at a rate of 9.7 kg hour and at a concentration of 2.5 by volume, respectively, when the temperature therein was raised to 600C. About 1.0 hour after starting introduction of propylene, introduction of ethylene was started at a rate of 2.2 kg hour and continued for 0.3 hour. The introduction of propylene and hydrogen was terminated when the introduced amount of propylene reached 11.8 kgs.The reaction was continued until the pressure in the reactor decreased to 2.0 kg sq.cm, followed by purging unreacted gas until the pressure therein was lowered to 0.2 kg sq.cm so far for blocks A and B . The temperature in the reactor was raised to 650C, and propylene and ethylene were introduced for 3 hours at the rates of 2.30 kg hour and 1.18 kg hour, respectively, while the concentration of hydrogen was controlled to be 5.0 by volume so far for block C . The block copolymer slurry thus obtained was treated as in Example 1 to give the corresponding block copolymer. The MFR of the resulting block copolymer as well as the ratio and compositon of block components are shown inTable 1. The procedures of Example 1 were repeated except that the amount of Kayahexa AD used was changed to 0.1 part by weight and the amount of divinylbenzene used to 0.23 part by weight. Thus the block copolymer was partially crosslinked. A sheet was then producedProperties of the resulting sheet are shown in Table 1.Example 7 A stainless steel 200 liter reactor equipped with a stirring vane was sufficiently replaced with propylene gas and then charged with 80 liters of heptane used as a polymerization solvent. The reactor was then charged with 50 g of DEAC and 9.0 g of titanium trichloride while the temperature therein was kept at 550C. Then introduction of propylene and hydrogen was started at a rate of 8.3 kg hour and at a concentration of 3.5 by volume, respectively, when the temperature therein was raised to 600C. About 1.5 hours after starting introduction of propylene, introduciton of ethylene was started at a rate of 1.0 kg hour and continued for 0.25 hour. The introduction of propylene and hydrogen was terminated when the introduced amount of propylene reached 13.9 kgs.The reaction was continued until the pressure in the reactor decreased to 2.0 kg sq.cm, followed by purging unreacted gas until the pressure therein was lowered to 0.2 kg sq.cm so far for blocks A and B . The temperature in the reactor was raised to 650C, and propoylene and ethylene were introduced for 2.3 hours at the rates of 1.25 kg hour and 1.70 kg hour, respectively, while the concentration of hydrogen was controlled to be 5.5 by volume so far for block C . The block copolymer slurry thus obtained was treated as in Example 1 to give the corresponding block copolymer. The MFR of the resulting block copolymer as well as the ratio and composition of block components are shown in Table 1. The procedures of Example 1 were repeated except that the amount of Kayahexa AD used was changed to 0,05 part by weight and the amount of divinylbenzene used to 0.05 part by weight. Thus the block copolymer was partially crosslinked.
