# WIRE PREPARATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A system for accepting conventional wire in bulk form, cutting the wire into predetermined lengths and preparing the ends of the wire for use in conventional wire harnesses is disclosed. More specifically, the system accepts as input data, in digital form, which fully describes each wire to be formed. Individual wires having the required length are cut from wire provided in bulk form. As each section of wire is measured and cut, it is stored in individual containers and the ends of each section is secured by a clamp. A transport system sequentially transports the stored wires to worksta tions where conventional wire preparation tasks such as stripping, marking and attachment of terminals are per formed. After all wire preparation functions have been performed, the individual wires are removed from their containers and utilized in forming wire harnesses.
