# Lamp socket assembly for mounting on printed circuit board.

## Abstract
A lamp socket assembly for use with a printed circuit, particularly where the mounting aperture in the circuit board is relatively small and the board may be remotely located. The assembly includes a lamp socket and a separate key member. The key receives the socket in latched relation therewith, the latching arrangement being such as to afford limited longitudinal displacement of the socket relative to the key. One or more biasing members, such as cantilevered spring fingers, are formed integrally with the socket, or preferably the key, and act to urge the socket relatively forward from the key. Electrical leads from the lamp pass over a flange formed at the base of the socket and are urged upwardly with the base into good electrical contact with the printed circuit on the under side of the board. The key member is preferably elongated to afford remote installation of the socket assembly on the printed circuit board.
