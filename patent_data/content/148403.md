# Linear feedback shift register.

## Abstract
A linear feedback shift register for inclusion in a VLSI circuit. During a test function for the VLSI circuit, the shift register can be programmed into an LSSD test mode, or to generate rest patterns for the VLSI circuit, and to perform a corresponding signature analysis on hashing functions on the VLSI response to the test pattern. The linear feedback shift register can be programmed on the VLSI chip to per form any of these test functions. During normal VLSI circuit operation, the shift register is transparent to logic signals carried by the VLSI circuit.
