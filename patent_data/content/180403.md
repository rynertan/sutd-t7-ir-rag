# Apparatus and method for encoding and decoding a binary data stream.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to apparatus for encoding and decoding a stream of randomly distributed binary bits rep resenting digital data of the type comprising encoding means 10 for encoding the stream of binary bits, recording means 18 for recording representations of the encoded stream of binary bits and recovery means 20, 25 for recovering timing signals and a stream of data signals from the recorded repre sentations. The apparatus is characterised in that the encoding means 10 achieves a run length limited, partial response coding of the data stream, and the recovery means comprises a first par tial response decoder 20 for recovering a timing signal from the recorded representations, and a second partial response decoder 22 and a constrained decoder 24 means for recovering a stream of data signals from the recorded represen tations. The present invention also relates to a method of encoding and decoding a stream of randomly distributed binary bits rep resenting digital data using apparatus as above.
