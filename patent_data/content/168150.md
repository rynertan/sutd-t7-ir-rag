# Electronic inclination sensing device.

## Abstract
A device is disclosed for sensing information relating to the orientation of a selected direction or plane with respect to the horizontal. In one embodiment, the invention comprises a housing 40 , a vial 70 mounting in the housing, a source of electromagnetic radiation 62, 64 , sensors 66, 68 and associated electronic circuitry, and a rail 12 for positioning the housing. The vial is elongated along a central longitudin al axis and is partially filled with liquid 72 to form a bubble 74 in the vial. The source of radiation is positioned in a housing plane to one side of the vial such that radiation passes through the vial and forms a shadow of the bubble on the other side of the vial. The shadow is detected by the sensors, and the associated electronic circuitry produces an output signal having a characteristic related to the bubble position along the longitudinal axis. The rail is adapted to position the housing with respect to a selected direction such that the housing is vertical and the orientation of the longitudinal axis of the vial with respect to the selected direction is known. The electronic circuitry is preferably adapted to produce an output signal corresponding to the difference between the signals provided by the sensors. A further embodiment is disclosed that is capable of sensing information relating to the orientation of a selected plane. In such further embodiment, the bubble 230 is contained in a chamber 226 beneath an inwardly concave upper wall 228 , and the shadwo 240 of the bubble is projected onto a two dimensional sensor array 234 .
