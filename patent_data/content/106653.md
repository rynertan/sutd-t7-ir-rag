# Hydroxyarylaldehyde preparation.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for preparing hydroxyarylaldehy des wherein a corresponding phenolic compound is reacted with formaldehyde, in the presence of a titanium or zirco nium containing catalyst, optionally in the presence of a catalyst promoter. Among other uses, the aldehydes are particularly useful as intermediates in the preparation of the corresponding oximes, which find utility as metal extrac tants.
