# Method and apparatus for replacing the electrodes of an electric arc furnace.

## Abstract
Replacement of the electrodes in an electric arc furnace with an electrode roof 9 removable from the furnace shell takes place by moving the electrodes downwards and upwards through the electrode roof when removed from the furnace shell, in connection with removing and inserting the electrodes from and into their holders 13 , respectively. An apparatus with a number of vertical tubes which can be placed below the removed electrode roof is arranged beside the furance shell. Used electrodes can be lowered into some of the tubes and jointed replacement electrodes can be pushed up through the electrode roof from other tubes. The tubes are placed on a revolving disc 2 for alternating placing below the electrode positions in the roof. By means of the invention replacement of the electrodes can take place without any personnel having to stay above the electrode roof.
