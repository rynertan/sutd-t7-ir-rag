# CONTROL APPARATUS FOR MOLDING PRESSES

## Abstract
A control apparatus 10 provides for automatic prog rammed sequencing of pressure bumps at precisely deter mined pressures in a molding press 15 and optionally provides for full pressure or low pressure cure at the conclusion of the bumping operation. The control apparatus comprises a press pressure monitor 11 that measures press clamp pressure and produces an output signal indicative of the measured press pressure, and a control circuit 12 that compares the output signal with a program selected one of a number of reference signals respectively indicative of bump pressures at which a bump may be desired and directs the press 15 to perform a bump upon a predetermined relationship between the output signal and reference signal, such being indicative of the attainment of the bump pressure indicated by the then selected reference signal. Upon completion of the bumping operation, either full or low pressure cure may be effected. For full pressure cure, the control circuit 12 permits press clamp pressure to increase to full pressure which is then maintained during cure. For low pressure cure, the control circuit 12 compares the output voltage of the press pressure monitor 11 to a program selected reference signal indicative of the desired cure pressure and upon a predetermined relationship there between indicative of the attainment of such cure pressure, directs the press 15 to maintain such pressure within a prescribed range.
