# Radio frequency generators.

## Abstract
A radio frequency generator comprises a set of switch ing transistors 1 to 4 which drive a radio frequency filter 5,6 of which an inductor 6 is tightly coupled to a coil 15 which feeds a bridge rectifier 17 . The rectifier 17 is biassed by the source of direct current and begins its rectifying action when the load current becomes excessive. The load current becomes excessive as a result for instance of mismatch of the antenna 7,8,9 . The arrangement provides protection against high load currents and thereby protects the switch ing elements 1 to 4 from damage.

## Description
RADIO FREQUENCY GENERATORS This invention relates to a radio frequency generator which incorporates a switching inverter which drives a filler to provide an output at a radio frequency for feeding a transmitting antenna. The inverter may assume any one of a variety of forms, but usually provides a square wave signal with the aid of solid state s itches which control power switches either directly or via a coupling transformer. The combination of an inverter and a radio frequency filter, such as a series resonance circuit, can provide a very efficient source of radio frequency power.However, accidents such as mismatch at the load or flash over at the antenna insulor car easily destroy the solid state switches and a though various protective circuits and devices have beer, devised, their failure rate has been so hiqh as to discourage the use of switching inverters for radio frequency generators. Onc object of tEIe present invention is to provide a generator with an improved protection against the effects of high load current cue to mismatch. According to the invention, a radio frequency generator conlprises a switchinu inverter which drives a radio frequency filter and includes a series reactance and a rectifier which is coupled to that reactance and is biassed such that its rectifying action limits the inveerter s switching current and retects the switching elements of the inverter. It is preferable that the rectifier1 which may be constituted by a bridge rectifier tightly coupled to an inductor of a series resonance circuit constituting the aforementioned filter, be biassed to provide substantial rectification only when the radio frequency current through the series reactance exceeds the radio frequency current in normal conditions of loading. The rectifier may be biassed by the source of direct current that feeds the switching inverter and to return rectified current tD that source.The rectifier will limit the radio frequency voltage across the series reactance and thereby limit the current through it this action liiiits the current through the stitches of the inverter and thereby protects them. One embodiment of the invention and a modification thereof will now be described by way of example with r√©ference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an explanatory diagram of a radio frequency generator comprising a switching inverter and a radio frequency filter Figure 2 is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of tie invention, some ancillary circuits having been omitted for simplicity and Figure 3 illustrates a modification of part of the embodiment illustrated by Figure 2. Figure 1 illustrates an inverter which converts direct current from. a source, such as a battery to a filtered radio frequency signal flowing in a load resistance R. The pairs of switches X,x and Y,y are alternately switched for equal periods, the switching cling at the desired radio frequency. A square wave voltage appears at the terminals A and B. The impedance of the series resonant circuit constituted by the inductorI, and the capacitor C is nearly zero at the desired radix frequency any is substantially qreater at the harmonics of that frequency. The unloaded quality factor Q of t .e resonant circuit is hic5h, for example of the order of 250. The reactance of the inductor or capacitor at a resonance is chosen to be approximately six times the impedance of the load resisto R the loaded slit factcr is f. The parallel tuned circuit comprising the inductor I, and the capacitor C1 is resonant at the chosen radio frequency. The unloaded quality factor is comparatively high whereas the loaded quality factor, when coupled tp the load resistor R is preferably about 2. If, in the arrangement shown iri figure 1, the impendance of the switches and the batter are approximately ero and the load resistance is short circuited, the current through the switches can rise to forty times the normal current and destroy the switches. If the load resistor is removed or open circuited, the hlgh impedance of the parallel resonance circuit is in series between the terminals A and B and the switching current is reduced to nil. Figure 2 is a simplified circuit diagram of one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, transistors 1 and 2 correspond to the switches t and y and the transistors 3 and e correspond to the switches N and X in Sure 1. Drive signals are applied to the base emitter junctions of these transistors by the secondaries 1a to 4a respectively of respective transformers which may be driven by switching transistors in accordance with known practice.The series resonant circuit of Figure 1 is constituted in this embodiment by the capaciton 5 and the inductor 6, the load resistor R by the resistor 7 and the parallel resonant circuit by the capacitor o nd the inductor 9. A transformer 10 of which the primary winding is in series with tjie series resonant circuit isolates the load in respect of direct current fro the switching circuit. A particular impedance ratio between the primary and secondary circuits of t his transformer mav be obtained by alteration of the turns ratio p of the transformer. Diode. 11 to 14 respectively are connected across the collector emitter junctions of the transistors 11 to 14. The purpose of these diodes is the prevention of the open circuiting of the filter network between the terminals A and B if all the transistors are momentarily non conductive. The duration of the on and off periods of the switching voltages applied to the bases of. the transistors 1 to 4 are preferably arranged so that transistors 1 and 4 or the transistors 3 and 4 are not simultaneously conductive. The choice of switching wave form is dependent on the storage delay time of the transistors It may be explained that the load current may be shared by a plurality of switching circuits in parallel and that if desired part of the radio frequency filter may be constituted by a set of parallel inductors or capacitors, one each for each of the parallel switching circuits as described in UK Patent Specification No. 14 584 Normally the switching circuits would be mounted on removable boards but the diodes 11 to 14 need not be mounted on these boards and, if they are not, the generator may continue to operate even if doric of the parallel switching circuits is removed. The embodiment shown in Figure 2 is provided with a protective arrangement which comprises a coil, tightly coupled to the inductor 6, a capacitor 16, which compensates for the leakage inductance of the coupling coil and a bridge rectifier 17 which is biassed by the voltage of the source of direct current, namely te battery which in this embodiment serves the transistors 1 to 4. The coil 15 and its coupling to the inductor 6 is selected to provide a voltage which will just Produce rectifying action in the bridge rectifier when the resistive loading of the radio frequency filter it normal and tuning is proper, that is to say the currents and voltages from the transistor switches 1 to 4 are an phase.If the load resistance is altered, whether by accident or otherwise, to demand more current from the trasistors, the increased flow of rectified current will prevent any substantial rise in the current required of the transistors.In practice, if the normal current is six amperes for a set of four switching transistors as shown, the carrent may be limited to about seven amperes when the load resistor is short circuited and the direct supply current would fall to about one ampere, six of the seven amperes being returned to the battery 19 by the rectifier. The radio frequency filter shown in Figure 2 is often called a zero phase shift match, because it provides either zero or 1800 phase shift between the current through the load resistor and tie series current between the terminals A and B. Sometimes phase quadrature matching may be desirable. If it is provided, an open circuit at tile load reduces the impendance between the terminals A und B and limitation of the current between A and B is required just as it is for the circuit which has been particularly described. Figure 3 illustrates a modification of the filter network between the terminals A and B and the associated rectifier. In the modification, a transformer 18 in parallel with the capacitor 5 couples the rectifier 17 to the capacitor rather than the inductor G.
