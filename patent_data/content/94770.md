# Competitive protein binding assay.

## Abstract
An improved competitive protein binding assay com prising incubating an analyte in the presence of labeled analyte and a protein binder suitable for competitive binding activity by the analyte and the labeled analyte to provide a mixture having free analyte, free labeled analyte, bound analyte and bound labeled analyte, substantially separating the bound analyte and the bound labeled analyte from the free analyte and free labeled analyte to form a first fraction containing substantially the bound analyte and the bound labeled analyte and a second fraction containing substantial ly the free analyte and the free labeled analyte by causing a pre determined level of the mixture to flow through a bed of an organo silane coupled to silica gel, and detecting the labeled analyte of at least one of the first and second fractions to determine the concentration of the analyte by comparison to a reference.
