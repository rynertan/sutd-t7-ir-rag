# Improvements in miniature spray guns.

## Abstract
An external mix miniature spray gun of the airbrush type obtains a spray of paint by directing a jet of gas from a source over a nozzle 9. A control valve for the flow of gas is connected at one end 26 to the source and an outlet 29 at the other end for discharge into the body of the gun. The valve includes a body of circular end profile with the inlet 26 leading to first generally radial flow passages 27 opening to the side of the valve body and second generally radial flow passages 28 leading from the side of the valve body to the outlet 29. A sleeve 2 is rotatably retained on the valve body by means 30 defining interengaging threads and spans between the first and second radial passages 27, 28 to define an internal space for gas flow therebetween. A tapered surface 35 in the gas flow space on the interior of the sleeve is arranged to approach or withdraw from a portion of the valve body to enlarge or diminish the gap therebetween as the sleeve is rotated relative to the body. At small degrees of valve opening the radial bores 28 are masked by the threads 30 of the sleeve so that the threads provide a flow resistance facilitating control at low gas flow rates. With a valve of the above kind the flow of air through the airbrush can be shut off in the airbrush itself rather than at source, the pressure can be adjusted in accordance with the fluid being sprayed and if the source is an aerosol type bottle the pressure can be regulated to maximise the aerosol life.
