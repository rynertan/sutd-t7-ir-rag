# Arithmetic unit with simple overflow detection system.

## Abstract
An arithmetic unit with a simple overflow detection sys tem performs arithmetic operations between first and sec ond data. The first data is exclusively divided into a fixed value portion and a variable portion whose digit position is lower than that of the fixed value portion. A ratio of a bit length of the fixed value portion to that of the variable por tion in the first data varies. The second data corresponds to only the variable portion of the first data. The arithmetic unit includes an adder 40 for adding the first and second data in their entire lenghts, switch circuits 50, 60 for separating output data from the first data and the adder 40 into fixed value and variable portions, a comparator 70 for compar ing the fixed value portions of the outputs from the first data and the adder 40 and outputting a coincidence or noncoin cidence signal, an output register 80 for linking the fixed value portion of the first data and the variable portion of the output from the adder 40 and outputting the linked data, and an overflow detector 90 for detecting an overflow in response to the noncoincidence signal from the comparator 70 .
