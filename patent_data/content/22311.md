# Multilayer liquid crystal device.

## Abstract
A guest host type liquid crystal display device not requiring the use of external polarizers but which can be operated vy economically low voltages includes two guest host type liquid crystal cells 1, 2 which are juxtaposed to each other and which are constructed in a manner that the liquid crystal molecules contained in the respective cells and located close to the boundary 1b, 2a between the two cells are aligned in a direction parallel to the plane of the boundary, but that the direction of alignment of the molecules in one cell 1 is perpendicular to that in the other cell 2 when a voltage is applied, or alternatively when no voltage is applied. The liquid crystal material may have a positive or a negative dielectric anisotropy. The device may contain at least one additional anisotropy. The device may contain at least one additional cell which is juxtaposed to the two cells 1, 2 .
