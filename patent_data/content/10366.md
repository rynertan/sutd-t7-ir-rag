# Solid organometallic inorganic polymers and their application.

## Abstract
The solid organometallic inorganic polymers of this invention have organo groups covalently bonded to phos phorus atoms. The phosphorus atoms are, in turn, covalently bonded by an oxygen linkage to tetravalent metal atoms. When formed in a layered crystalline state, they provide the organo groups on all of the apparent and interlamellar sur faces.
