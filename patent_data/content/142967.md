# OPTICAL DOCUMENT SCANNER

## Abstract
A low cost, hand operated optical document scanner for human readable information comprises a hand held light pen 10 and a stencil 1 . The stencil is provided with a zigzag track consisting of a number of parallel straight tracks 2 joined to each other by bend portions 4 . The light pen 10 has a tip arrangement which engages in the zigzag track and is adapted to prevent rotation of the light pen during movement thereof along the track. The stencil is provided with index marks 20 along the length of the tracks 2 in order to provide timing signals for the light pen 10 and may also be provided with an indicia indicating the end or beginning of a straight track 2 . The optical arrangement of the light pen 10 can be adapted such that, when the stencil 1 is made of transparent material, areas between adjacent straight tracks 2 can be scanned by the light pen 10 .
