# Process for the preparation of a 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole 1,1 dioxide and the use of this compound as a biocide and for preparing an ortho sulphobenzimide.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a one step process for the prep aration of a 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole 1,1 diox ide in a high yield by oxidation of an ortho toluene sulphonamide in the liquid phase using molecular oxygen and or ozone in the presence of one or more catalysts. The oxidation is terminated before 50 of the starting material has been convented into resultant oxidation prod ucts from the 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole 1,1 dioxide and into other oxidation products. It is preferred that the reaction should be carried out in acetic acid or free of solvent using cobalt and or manganese salts as a catalyst. The benzisothiazole 1,1 dioxides can be oxidized to an ortho sulphobenzimide. In this way saccharin can be pre pared. The bezsothiazole 1,1 dioxides also display biocidal activity.

## Description
Process for the preparation of a 3 tydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenziso thiazole l,l dioxide and the use of this compound as a biocide and for preparing an ortho sulphobenzimideThe invention relates to a process for the preparation of a 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide by oxidation in the liquid phase of an ortho toluene sulphonamide. A process of the above type is known from Helv. Chem. Acta, 12, 669 1929 . It describes a process in which by a multi step synthesis a derivative of 3 hydroxy 2 3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,1 dioxide can be obtained in very low yield from an ortho toluene sulphonamide.A method has now been found by which in a one step process a high yield conversion can be realized.The invention consists in that in a process of the type indicated above the oxidation is carried out using molecular oxygen and or ozone in the presence of one or more catalysts, and the formation of byproducts is limited by terminating the oxidation before 50 of the starting material has been converted into resultant oxidation products from the 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide and into other oxidation products.The reaction may be represented as follows EMI1.1 wherein the group X is an aromatic ring substituent such as an alkyl group, an acyl group, a carboxyl group, a nitro group or a halogen atom. When X alkyl, the reaction will generally differ from the above representation in that the alkyl groups will be partially oxidized. The value of n is 0, 1 or 2. As oxidation agent molecular oxygen and or ozone may be used, optionally inert gas may be present. The reaction is carried out in the liquid phase and in the presence or not of a solvent. Examples of suitable solvents include aliphatic carboxylic acids which may be esterified and or halogenated, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, ethyl acetate, 2 bromoproprionic acid and methyl chioroacetate. It is preferred that the reaction should be carried out in acetic acid or free of solvent. The amount of the ortho toluene sulphonamide which is dissolved in acetic acid is generally in the range of 3 to 20 per cent by weight.To increase the rate of the reaction the process is carried out in the presence of at least one catalyst which is suitable for use in the oxidation of alkylaromatic hydrocarbors. Examples of suitable catalysts include cobalt salts, manganese salts, iron salts and nickel salts of organic or inorganic acids.A preferred catalyst is cobalt Il bromide or cobalt II acetate to which a small amount of hydrogen bromide is added.The presence of a manganese salt in combination with a cobaltsalt has a favourable effect on the rate and the selectivity of the oxidation reaction.The duration of the reaction is very much dependent on the choice of the temperature, pressure and oxygen concentration.The reaction will generally be carried out at a temperature in the range of 1000 to 200 C and a pressure of 1 to 30 bar. The preparation may be carried out batch wise or in a continuous process.Essential to the invention is that the reaction is stopped before 50 of the substituted ortho toluene sulphonamide has been converted into resultant oxidation products from the substituted 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide and into other oxidation products. The oxidation is preferably stopped when 90 to 99 of the ortho toluene sulphonamide has been converted.In this way the formation of byproducts is curbed, which is illustrated in Fig. 1. This figure shows that the conversion of sulphonamide and the formation of benzisothiazole initially proceed at a high speed.The formation of benzisothiazole, however, will reach a maximum value and upon continuation of the oxidation the amount of benzisothiazole will rapidly decrease. Important byproducts that are formed then are saccharin and ortho sulphobenzoic acid.It should be added that NL 7 103 967 describes a process for the preparation of ortho sulphobenzimides, such as saccharin, by oxidation of ortho toluene sulphonamides with oxygen in the presence of catalysts.The present benzisothiazole l,l dioxides are also very suitable starting materials for the preparation of ortho sulphobenzimides by oxidation. Examples of suitable oxidation agents include hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate and chromium trioxide. It is preferred that use should be made of hydrogen peroxide. Oxi dation may be carried out in an aqueous medium at atmospheric pressure and a temperature in the range of 25 to 100 C, preferably 60 to 950 C. The ortho sulphobenzimides can be converted into a salt, e.g. a sodium salt.Preferably saccharin or the sodium salt therefrom is prepared.The invention also relates to another use of the present benzothiazole l,l dioxides.It has been found that these compounds are particularly suitable for use as a biocide or for the preparation of a composition having biocidal activity. It appears that 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydro benzothiazole l,l dioxide displays better bacteriostatic and fungistatic activity than 3 methoxy l,2 benzisothiazole l,l di oxide disclosed in US 3 629 428, as will be demonstrated in Example 3. The minimum growth inhibiting concentration MIC value of 3 hydroxy 2, 3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l ,l dioxide for the different types of microorganisms was det ermined in conformity with the dilution test method of the Deutsche Gesellschaft fUr Hygiene und Mikrobologien DGHM and are gram negative bacteria 600 2400 ppm gram positive bacteria 600 1200 ppm yeasts 300 1200 ppm fungi 37,5 600 ppm.The compound displays a low oral toxicity, a remarkable bacteriostatic activity towards sulfphate reducing bacteria and in comu bination with some quaternary ammonium compounds such as dimethylbenzyl coco ammonium chloride or didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride it has a synergistic effect relative to certain bacteria. The present biocides are particularly suitable to be used under anaerobic conditions.If required, the 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide can be used in the form of a salt or a derivative in which the hydroxy group is replaced by for instance a methoxy group see example 2 . Such compounds easily hydrolyse back to the 3 hydroxy 2 , 3 dihydrobenzisothiazole. The 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide may be used undiluted or in combination with a liquid or solid diluent. It is preferred that the diluent should be chemically inert relative to the biocide.Examples of suitable solid diluents or carriers are clay, kaolin, talc, silica, vermiculite, etc.Liquid diluents are liquids in which the biocide can be dissolved, emulsified of dispersed, in the presence optionally of a surface active agent.As examples of suitable diluents may be mentioned water, keroi sine, dioxane, acetone, animal and vegetable fats.The effectiveness of the biocide may be promoted by adding one or more agents, such as a spreading agent, a wetting agent, a sticking agent and an emulsifying agent. Depending on its field of application the biocide may be used in combination with other biologically active compounds such a s bactericides, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and antibiotics. The concentration of the 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide in the total composition may range within wide limits. In liquid compositions generally a concentration of 50 to 2000 ppm is adhered to and in solid eompositions a concentration of 0,5 to 20 percent by weight.The present biocide may be used to control undesira ble bacteria yeasts and fungi both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.Fields of application include agriculture, fruit growing and bulb farming. The present biocides are also very suitable to control sulphate reducing bacteria in water systems.The invention will be further described in the following examples.Example 1 3 Hydroxy 2 ,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide was prepared as follows. To acetic acid 2800 g there were added at 800 C ortho toluene sulphonamide 390 g , cobalt II acetate 21 g , manganese II acetate 2,5 g and hydrogen bromide 32 g of a 47 solution in water . The mixture was charged into an autoclave and pressure was applied nitrogen 9 bar and on top of which afterwards oxygen 6 bar . Subsequently, the reaction mixture was heated, with stirring, to a temperature of 1200 C, which was attended with rapid take up of oxygen and the temperature rising to 1900 C. During the reaction oxygen was supplied at a rate such that in the autoclave a pressure was maintained which consisted of an initial pressure corrected for the temperature increased by the vapour pressure of acetic acid.One and a half minutes after a reaction temperature of 1900 C had been attained, the reaction was terminated by rapid cooling. The total reaction time was 6 minutes. It was found that at a conversion of 96 of the orthotoluene sulphonamide 74 had been converted into 3 hydroxy 2,3dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide.Example 2 optionally, the 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide may be purified as follows. The product mixture of Example 1 was concentrated by evaporation under reduced pressure 15 20 mm Hg, 50 60 C . The resulting concentrate contained about 20 of acetic acid and 55 of 3 hy droxy 2 , 3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l, 1 dioxide. The concentrate was ref fluxed for 2 hours in methanol 1700 g . Upon cooling the solution, 3 methoxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothazole l,l crys tallized. The mother liquor could be used to convert a next batch of the concentrate. In this way 3 methoxy 2,3 dthydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide could be obtained in a yield of over 95 .This compound 150 g was subsequently refluxed for 2 hours in demineralized water 4 1 , with the compound going into solution. Upon cooling the solution 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide crystallized. The crystals were washed with water and dried at 25 C. The yield of 3 hydroxy 2,3 benziso thiazole l,l dioxide was 54 , the purity 98 99 . The mother liquor could be used for a next hydrolysis, as a result of which the yield increased from 54 to almost 100 , without any detrimental effect on the purity of the product.Example 3Ortho toluenesulphonamide was dissolved in acetic acid and after addition of cobalt II acetate, manganese II acetate and hydrogen bromide it was oxidized with oxygen. The product mixture 500 g , which contained 248 g of 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole l,l dioxide, was evaporated off at 60C C and a pressure of 2 to 3 mm Hg. Previously, a little water had been added to avoid side reactions. Subsequently, 304 g of hydrogen peroxide 30 were added to the mixture over a period of 2 hours at 80 C for 1 more hour, it was cooled and the crystalline saccharin was filtered and dried saccharin yield 250 g, purity 95 , efficiency 97 .Example 4The bacteriostatic and fungistatic action of 3 hydroxy 2,3 di hydrobenzisothiazole l ,l dioxide and the 3 methoxy l,2 benziso thiazole l,l dioxide described in US 3 629 428 was determined by a modified dilution method of the fDeutsche Gesellschaft fur Hygiene und Mikrobiologien DGHM and is described in Richtlinien fur die Prufung und Bewerkung chemischer Desinfektionsi verfahren , pp. 4 5, Gustav Fischer, Stuttgart, 1981.The MIC values determined in this way are given in the table below, which shows that 3 hydroxy 2,3 dihydrobenzisothiazole 1,1 dioxide has a higher bacteriostatic and a far higher fungistatic activity than 3 methoxy 1,2 benzisothiazole 1,1 dioxide.
