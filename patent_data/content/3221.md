# Process for the manufacture of 3,4 dihydro benzopyran derivatives and starting materials in this process.

## Abstract
The invention is concerned with a novel process for the manufacture of chromane derivatives of the formula This process comprises reducing a compound of the formula wherein R¹, R² and R³ are hydrogen or lower alkyl and R , R⁴ and R⁵ are lower alkyl, in a polar solvent in the presence of a base. The invention is further concerned with the novel compounds of formula II which are used as starting materials. The compounds of formula I are, inter alia, valuable intermediates in the synthesis of vitamin E.
