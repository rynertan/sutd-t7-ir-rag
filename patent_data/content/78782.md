# Method for producing foodstuffs from whole cereal grains.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for pro ducing foodstuffs from whole cereal grains, whereby the grains in aqueous phase are subjected to an enzyme treat ment to solubilize the starch content of the grains, where by the method is an improvement in that the formation of sugar protein compounds, such as glucoproteins, are avoides, which is obtained thereby that the grains in dry form are added to the aqueous phase simultaneously with the enzyme used, and whereby the temperature of the aqueous phase is such that dextrines and oligosaccha rides only are formed before the enzyme is sterilized. The products obtained can be used as meat replacement product as regard the solid phase, and can, with regard to the liquid phase obtained, be further decomposed to sugars of different kinds.

## Description
METHOD FOR PRODUCING FOODSTUFFS FROM WHOLE CEREAL GRAINS.DESCRIPTIONTechnical field.The present invention relates to a method for producing foodstuffs from whole cereal grains, and more particularly to a heat technical wet processing method, where primarily the proteins of the respective cereal grain is so treated that its original nutritional value, related to the protein, is maintained intact for human consumption.Background of the invention.Heat technical wet processing of whole cereal grains is previously known and is used i.a. in. the processing of beer.Thereby the enzymes amylases present in the grain are used after malting, or bacterial enzymes tamylases are used.After a far reaching enzymatic saccharification of the starch contents of the grain, as e.g. wheat, rye, oat, barley, maize corn , rize, sorghum, etc. sterilization is carried out by a violent boiling followed by a separation of husks bran and precipitated proteins. The time periods used. for carrying out these processes are, however, so long that too a far denauturated protein is obtained, which can not be used for anything else but animal feedstuffs.The reason why the protein value is deteriotated in such a wet processing method is very complicated, but is primarily de endent on the formation of certain sugar and proteincompounds, which are difficult to digest by the human body.Such proteins are primarily of the glucoprotein type.It is also known that such glucoproteins are formed from the respective protein only if an amount enough of free glucose molecules are at hand. Bound glucose molecules, such as dextrines, and oligosaccharides, do not react with the proteins.Normal saccharification of the starch contents of the grains is always carried out in an aqueous slurry of the grains in the presence of siutable enzymes and the addition of heat.The grains of the slurry are heated by the water, either in directly through heat exchange or directly by means of so called jet boiling, which is often carried out in two steps.None of these methods give, however, a satisfactory choch to the grains rapid hydrolyzation of the starch granules present and a simultaneous sterilization of the enzyme added to prevent the formation of undesired free glucose.Prior art also discloses a method for producing a grain sirup where the whole contents of the proteins are present in the final product, SE 7808870 5 . However, in certain cases said presence of proteins is undesired, and it is thus necessary to remove the proteins. Disclosure of the prese nt inve fltidfl. It has now surprisingly been shown technically possible to reduce the format.on of free glucose almost completely, while dissolving the contents of grains to form starch derivatives and undissolved proteins. The method is thereby characterized in that simultaneously with the dosage of the enzymes used the grains are added in dry form directly to the water, which has such a temperature that the starch of the grains is converted only to soluble dextrines and oligosaccharides prior to the sterilization of the enzyme. The protein present in the grains is set free and is thereby suspended in the hydrolysate, and any formation of sugar protein compounds are eliminated.Further characteristics of the invention will be apparent from the accompanying claims.The slurry obtained, which contains husks bran , pentosanes, starch hydrolysate, and released proteins, is subjected to a further sterilization which sterilises substantially all the earth bacteria which may be present and give, if present, the undissolved components of the slurry, such as husks, pentosanes, and proteins a more solid consistency at the subsequent separation. Such a solid consistency is not desired, due to filtration properties, which are then reduced. This sterilization is preferably carried out using a so called UHT method ultra high temperature for 2 seconds at 1400C, and a subsequent cooling in vacuo to about 75 0C prior to the separation. The method is known to be used in the sterilization of milk to give long term storability.It has not previously been used in this context, but has surprisingly been shown to give a total protection against protein destruction, which is shown by the absence of Mail lard compounds.The separation of solid and dissolved phases, respectively, is carried out in a way known per se, using suction filtration, centrifugation.by means of a decanter, pressure, etc..The solid phase, e.g. the filter cake, contains primarily a minor part of the liquid phase, the sirup. This sirup is easily removed by washing with water, and to the process as starting water in a following cycle.The liquid phase of starch hydrolysate contains a minor part of nonprecipitated proteins, such as water soluble albumines, normally present in an amount of 1 percent of the grain.These soluble proteins can, if so desired, be removed completely by a so called ultra filtration. Ultra filtration is used industrially to recover a protein concentrate from whey in accordance with the WPC method.It has not previously been used in this context.The present method will be described more closely in detail with reference to the Examples given below.Example t. Continuous process.Wheat grains were rolled or ground to such a degree that was wanted in a final, solid end product, generally 0.5 3 mm. The grains thus crushed were fed continuously to a vessel contains ing water having a temperature of 95 C, simultaneously as en zymes were added in an amount related to the amount of the wheat crush added. The amount of water was adjusted to be 3 parts of water per 1 part of wheat. The slurry obtained was pumped off continuouSly, simultaneously with an addition of fresh water, enzymes, and wheat crush. The enzyme used wasBAN 120L by NOVO, Copenhagen, Denmark, and was added in an amount of 0.5 g per kilo of crush.The slurry being pumped off was transferred to a UHT sterilization, followed by a separation of solid and liquid phases with a subsequent washing of the solid phase to a clean product, which was dried to a so called wheat meat bran gluten .The liquid phase, the starch hydrolysate, was transferred to an ultra filtration process. The liquid being freed from all proteins can then be saccharified further to give a starch sirup comprising dextrose and or isomerose sugars, after a further enzymatic treatment using amyloglucosidase and or isomerase. The protein fraction obtained at the ultra filtration in the form of a concentrate was added to the solid phase while this was dried in a manner known per se.

It has a protein content of about 35 by weight.The product showed to be a very suitable meat replacement product to swine and beef meat in minced meat products, such as sausages, pat, hamburgers, meat balls, etc..Example 3. Preparation of sausage.Standard recipe Meat part 4 kg of swine meat 2 keg of beef meat 6 kg Example sausage recipe 3 kg of swine meat 3 kg of wheat and sorghum meat 50 50 1.2 kg of boiled potatoes 1.5 kg of lard 0.1 kg of fat free milk q.s.of salt and spices 8.8 kg mixture to be filled into skin.3 kg of grain meat per 8.8 kg of readily prepared mixture make 34 by weight. Example 4. Pre p ara tiOn of onion Sausage. Standard recipe Meat part mj7k of swine meat 7 kgExample sausage recipe 3 kg of coarsely ground swine meat 4 kg of wheat sorghum meat 1 kg of lard in pieces 8 kgOnion and other ingredients were added to the meat part in accordance with the original recipe. The sausages thus prepared were smoked for one day at 45 C. Taste, flavor, and general apperance were in accordance with the originals. Example 5. Meat bÅalls. 425 g of minced swine meat 225 g of wheat meat 75 g of dry product, 150 g of water 20 g of milk powder 70 g of boiled potatoes 40 g of egg 70 g of chopped onion q.s. of salt and spices 850 g of mixture to be formed to meat balls and fried.the meat balls contained 26.5 by weight of wheat meat. The meat balls were fried in the same way as standard meat balls.The meat balls obtained containing wheat meat, however, gave a better colour upon frying and a less frying loss depending on the water binding fibres present in the wheat meat and being derived from the bran. The solid phase obtained by the process according to the invention from wheat, as well as sorghum, had prior to the washing out of the remaining sirup, a content of such residual sirup as follows Yield Starting material 100 g of crushed wheatLiquid phase 52.5 g of sirup dry matter 51 g of starch derivatives 1.5 g of mineralsSolid phase 47.5 g of dry matter 20 g of bran 11 g of proteins 0.5 g of minerals 16 g of sirupAfter drying, the solid phase has sown to be suitable as an additive to bread as it adds valuable fibres, corresponding to that amount present in so called whole grain bread , 11 t as well as it gives an increase of the total protein content to about 8 t compared to 5.7 in standard bread, which is an increase of about 40 . The following comparative recipes are given Example 6.Standard bread Water 135 g Yeast 8 g Sugar sirup 5 g Salt 2 g Wheat flour 200 g Dough 350 g comprising Fibres 0 g Proteins 20 g 5.7 t Improved bread Water 135 g Yeast 8 g Salt 2 g Wheat meat 55 g fibres 23g,proteins 13 g, Wheat flour 150 g sirup 18 g, minerals 1 g Dough 350 g comprising Fibres 23 g Proteins 28 gThe bread is fermented and baked in the same way as any standard bread. The wheat meat bread gives, however, a better baking depending on the sugar content maltose and a better storability, i.e. stays fresher after one day at open storage depending on the water binding capacity of the fibres.The solid phase obtained by the present process and after having been washed is free from any residual sirup. It has a protein content of about 35 Oo by weight after having been dried.Both swine and beef meat have a similar protein content. The product has been shown to be suitable as a replacement product both for swine and beef meat, and can replcae up to 50 of such meat. Hereby the animalic fat content is reduced in the final product, and the amino acid composition becomes improved from a nutritional point of view. Further valuable fibres are added to the meat product made therefrom. The total price of the final product will decrease as well, as the vegetabilic protein is cheaper than the animalic proteins.BAN 120L sold by NOVO has been used in the Example above. However, any cL amylase can be used to decompose the starch contents of the grains, such as THERNIAfYL, which is a high temperature resistant C anylase. Thereby the processing temperature can be elevated, and has to in order to sterilize the enzymeIn the Examples above a continuous process has been shown. It is, however, evident to any skilled in the art that the process can be carried out in a batch wise procedure.Example 7.After having isolated the liquid phase in the primary step, i.e. the first hydrolyzation of the starch to dextrines and oligosaccharides, and avoiding the formation of glucose, the phase is further hydrolyzed using amyloglucosidase. Thereby 0 2 g of OPTIDEX L were added per 1000 g of grains added to the original aqueous slurry. The temperature was lowered to 60 0C prior to the addition of the enzyme. After 24 hrs at this temperature 98 t of the starch present had been converted to pure glucose. The enzymatic treatment was carried out at a pH of 4.5. The pH was then increased to about 6.0 by means of sodium carbonate, and from 6.0 to 7.0 by means of an addition of magnesium hydroxide. 1.5 g of a fructose forming isomerose forming enzyme ITOPTISWEET P were added and the temperature was kept at 60 C for another 24 hrs during automatic adjustment of the pH to 7.0 by the addition of sodium carbonate. After these 24 hrs 48 of the original glucose present had been converted into fructose. After finished isomerazation pH was adjusted to 6.0 by means of some citric acid, whereupon the aqueous phase was concentrated to a sirup containing 98 of the original starch content, and only 10 of the original protein content, i.e. the sirup contained about 1 by weight of protein only.
