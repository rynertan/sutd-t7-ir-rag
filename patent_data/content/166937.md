## Description
This invention relates to novel adrenergic compounds useful in the treatment of hypertension, depression, nasal congestion, metabolic disorders e.g. obesity and migraine. The adrenergic nervous system plays a major role in the innervation of heart, blood vessel and smooth muscle tissue. Compounds capable of interacting with receptor sites within the adrenergic nervous system can initiate a variety of physiological responses, including vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and increased or decreased heart rate chronotropic , contractility inotropic and metabolic activity. In the past, various adrenergic compounds have been employed to affect these and other physiological responses. However, many adrenergic compounds do not possess significant selectivity to enable desirable interactions with adrenergic receptor sites. That is, these adrenergic compounds do not demonstrate a high degree of specificity for differing receptor types within the adrenergic nervous system in order to obtain a desired physiological response separate from other possible, and perhaps less desirable, responses of the system. It has now been determined that a new class of compounds, as herein defined, demonstrate an ability to selectively stimulate agonists or inhibit antagonists α adrenergic receptors which are mainly distributed on the membranes of central and peripheral adrenergic neurons and on the tissues innervated thereby. Through inhibitory interaction with the α adrenergic receptor in the peripheral nervous system, one can modulate the function of adrenergic neurons and hemodynamic equilibrium which is therapeutically useful in a multitude of cardiovascular indications such as hypertension, congestive heart failure, and a variety of vascular spastic conditions. Stimulatory interaction with α adrenergic receptors in the peripheral nervous system is therapeutically useful in situations where vascular constrictions such as nasal, otic or ophthalmic congestion and inflammation occur. In the central nervous system, stimulatory adrenergic receptor agonists are therapeutically useful for sedation, diuresis, and in treatment of addictive behavior and hypertension. The α adrenergic antagonists in the central nervous system are useful in certain neurological and psychiatric disorders such as depression as well as for maintenance of cardiovascular equilibrium.

The selectivity of the compounds can be demonstrated In the latter test, a group of SH male rats are trained to be restrained in a wire mesh cylinder in a warming box, at least two training cycles being conducted before testing. The rats are warmed for about one half hour period to blood pressure measurement, the warming box being maintained at a constant temperature of 36 C. An occluding cuff attached to a programmed sphymomanometer is placed near the base of the tail of each rat and the pressure in the cuff is increased automatically from 0 to 33000 Pa at a rate of 1300 Pa per second. The total time for each cycle of inflation and deflation of the cuff is 50 seconds and the interval between cycles is one minute. A photocell is placed distal to the cuff to record the pulses due to forward motion of blood flow with each heart beat. As the pressure in the cuff increases, the pulse disappears completely at a point where cuff pressure equals or exceeds the arterial blood pressure and it reappears during deflation at approximately the same pressure. Five interference free signals for deflation are recorded for each rat. Rats with a blood pressure of 24000 Pa or more during the control period are used in the study. Blood pressure and heart rate readings are recorded on a polygraph at various intervals after administration of the test compound. When tested in accordance with the foregoing procedure, the preferred compounds of the invention have decreased the arterial blood pressure and or heart rate of rats of the group. The compounds of the invention can be administered in any effective pharmaceutically acceptable form to warm blooded animals, e.g., in oral, parenteral or infusable dosage forms, or as a buccal or nasal spray. Suitable parenteral routes of administration include, for example, intramuscular, intravenous, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration of the compounds. In addition to the active compounds, compositions according to this invention for parenteral injection may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions or emulsions. Examples of suitable nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or other sterile injectable medium, immediately before use. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositons may also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents. Actual dosage levels of active ingredient in the compositions of the invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of active ingredient effective to obtain a desired therapeutic response for a particular composition and method of administration. The selected dosage level therefore depends upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration, on the desired duration of treatment and other factors. Generally, dosage levels of about 0.1 to about 200, more preferably about 0.5 to about 150 and most preferably about 1 to about 125 mg of active ingredient per kg of body weight per day are administered orally to a mammalian patient suffering from hypertension. If desired, the daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for administration, e.g., two to four separate doses per day. The foregoing is merely illustrative of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the disclosed compounds.
