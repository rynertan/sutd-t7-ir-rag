# TUBULAR COAL TRANSPORT SYSTEM

## Abstract
A tubular coal transport system wherein a continuous successjon of individually powered loaded cars travel through a tube from a coal source to a receiving terminal over an extended distance. Each wheeled car has a generally cylindrical form and includes a bottom trough in which electric motors are installed to drive the car wheels at a controlled rate, and a cover composed of two arcuate sections hinged to the trough and foldable therein to collapse the car when it is empty, thereby reducing the volume of the emptied car. When loaded, the cars travel from the coal source to the receiving terminal along a foward track mounted on the base of the tube adjacent one side wall thereof. When empty, the collapsed cars travel back to the coal source on a return track mounted on the opposite side wall of the tube, the cars being held in place by guide rails. The arrangement is such that the succession of loaded and empty cars travelling in opposing directions occupy substan tially all available tube space.
