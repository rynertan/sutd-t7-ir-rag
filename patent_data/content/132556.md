# Immunoassay.

## Abstract
An immunoassay of the type which utilizes the hemolysis of microcapsules such as red blood cells. Microcapsules which can be lysed by complement activity, which contain an optically determinable substance, on whose surfaces an anti body to be quantified is bound are prepared. The microcap sules, a test sample containing the antigen or the antibody to be quantified, and complement are mixed to react each other. Thereafter, an optical measurement is conducted at different wavelengths for the reaction mixture which is still suspending the intact microcapsules.
