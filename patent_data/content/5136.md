# Graft copolymer useful in electrodeposition.

## Abstract
A polyamine epoxy ester graft copolymer having an acrylic polyamine backbone with secondary amine and hydroxy functionality, part of which is terminal primary hydroxy groups, onto which is grafted an epoxy fatty acid ester. The ester is an epoxy resin reacted with a fatty acid resulting in a monoepoxide ester with one or less epoxy group per acid group. The ester is reacted with part of the secondary amine on the acrylic backbone. This system can be formulated to a nearly neutral pH cathodic dispersion with good cure response at 150 175 C using conventional aminoplast crosslinkers.
