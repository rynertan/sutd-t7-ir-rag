# Sealing system for a turbomachine.

## Abstract
A buffer fluid system for a turbomachine includes flow regulating means for regulating the quantity of buffer fluid flowing to a buffer fluid sealing region from an operating region receiving relatively high pressure fluid through a pressure reducing seal. The buffer system utilizes the leak age flow and vented flow is injected into the inlet of the machine.
