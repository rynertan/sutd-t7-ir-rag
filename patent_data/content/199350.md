# Method of mending defective wood plate.

## Abstract
A method of mending a defective wood plate 12 uses, instead of putty, a solid patching material 18 which is smaller in thicknesswise shear strength and compressive strength than the wood plate 12 and is sized greater than a defect of the plate which is to be mended. The solid patching material 18 is applied to the plate in such a manner as to cover the defect 20 and, then, compressed in the thickness wise direction to undergo shear fracture. As a result, that part of the material which overlies the defect is thrusted into the defect. The compression is effected in two consecutive stages, one using a rigid member and the other an elastic member. The part of the material 18 filled in the defect 20 is separated from the other part which remains on the plate 12 . Where this method is applied to plywood production, the material 18 will be forced into the defect 20 without resorting to an extra compression step while the plate is being bonded to another.
