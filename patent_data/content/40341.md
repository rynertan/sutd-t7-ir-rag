# Two wire frequency division multiplex system.

## Abstract
Two kinds of multiplex stations A,B are connected by two wire lines and distinguished by two different predeter mined frequency basebands each of which consists of pre determined frequencies for dividing the multiplex channels. The multiplex stations are provided with conversion means 2 in their respective transmit paths such as to convert their own basebands to the different ones of the other multiplex stations connected and vice versa. The systems preferably provides generalized units in both kinds of multiplex stations and is simpler than a known one which uses the same basebands in all multiplex stations and converts the baseband before and after transmitting.
