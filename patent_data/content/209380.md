## Abstract
A helical scan video tape recorder records time axis compressed PCM audio signals on auxiliary recording tracks on a recording medium and has a synthesisation circuit 30 which mixes normal frequency modulated audio signals, recorded on video tracks with the video signals, with the time axis com pressed PCM audio signals before reproduction. The PCM audio signals require digital processing for time axis com pression before recording and subsequent expansion upon reproduction, and so are recorded and reproduced later than the frequency modulated audio signals. Thus, when repro duced, the PCM audio component lags behind the frequency modulated audio component, resulting in an echo effect. Ad justment of the relative amplitude levels of the two types of audio signals during synthesisation produces acoustical ef fects that can simulate the acoustics of a concert hall.
