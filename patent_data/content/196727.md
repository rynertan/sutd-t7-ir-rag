A multilayer bag provided with a peelable seal, obtainable by first producing a laminated film of which at least one surface is a sealing layer comprising a blend of 65 to 95 wt. copolymer of ethylene and one or more 1 alkenes having 3 18 carbon atoms with a density between 870 and 940 kg m³, and preferably between 900 and 935 kg m³, and 5 to 35 wt. polypropylene and or poly 1 butylene, then superimposing the laminated film such that the sealing layers contact each other and finally heat sealing the edges of the laminated film at a temperature between 70 and 125 C.

## Description
The invention relates to multilayer bags provided with peelable seals. Bags produced from various materials, as well as bags consisting of a plurality of layers, are known in many applications. Particularly the packaging application has expanded enormously. The bottom of a bag is squeezed together at high temperatures for instance 130 C and thus sealed. Generally it is desirable for this seal not to peel off or to become detached in the use of the bag. On the other hand, when the bag serves for the packaging of foodstuffs, it is often highly desirable for the seal to become detached fairly easily on at least one side of the bag when force is applied to it, in other words the seal must be capable of being peeled off. In the process the sealing layer must not become detached from the film to which it has been applied, because such delamination results in fibre formation. This is a serious disadvantage in the packaging of foodstuffs. So far it has been known how to use ionomers as peelable seals. These serve their purpose, but are rather expensive. The object of the invention is to obtain a multilayer bag provided with a peelable seal which is easy of application and not expensive. Surprisingly, this object was achieved by applying a blend of a copolymer of ethylene with one or more C₃ C₁₈ l alkenes LLDPE and polypropylene PP and or poly 1 butylene PB as sealing layer in weight percentages calculated on the total sealing layer of 65 95 for the LLDPE and 5 35 for the PP and or PB, and using a sealing temperature between 70 and 125 C. This was not expected, because GB A 2,029,762 teaches the use of such blends for non peelable seals. According to the present invention, preference is given to applying 75 to 95 wt LLDPE and 5 to 25 wt PP and or PB, and specifically 80 to 90 wt LLDPE and 10 20 wt PP and or PB calculated on the total sealing layer. LLDPE is understood to mean copolymers of ethylene and one or more C₃ C₁₈ 1 alkenes. Particularly copolymers of ethylene and 1 octene serve their purpose in the use of peelable seals after mixture with PP and or PB. LLDPE with a density ranging from 870 kg m³ upto 935 kg m³ and a melt index ranging from 0,2 dg min to 15 dg min, preferably 0,8 to 10 dg min serve their purpose satisfactorily in the use of peelable reals after blending with PP and or PB. In particular for high speed packaging lines, where low sealing temperatures and short sealing lines are required, densities of 900 915 kg m³ are preferred and offer better peeling characteristics than the existing systems. The PP should be a homopolymer with a melt viscosity at the processing conditions that is close to the meltviscosity of the LLDPE. The choice of meltviscosities, such that the PP homopolymer will disperse in the LLDPE melt, is preferred. A suitable MI range, measured at 230 C and 2,16 kg, will be about 1.0 to about 15 dg min, depending on the chosen meltindex of the LLDPE. A peelable seal in the first place serves as a seal of for instance, a bag of salt flavoured biscuits, roasted peanuts, corn flakes and other foodstuffs. In order to keep these in a fresh state the sealing layer must not peel off forthwith in the handling of the foodstuffs. That is why the seal must comply with minimum bonding requirements and must not peel off until a certain force is applied. A desired threshold value for the seal to peel off is 1 N. On the other side, the seal should come released if some force is applied to it. This force must not be too great, of course, for otherwise the contents of the bag cannot be reached without the use of auxiliary devices, or the bag will be torn in an undesired manner, when opened. That is why the threshold value of the force required to loosen the seal, or the peeling force, must not be greater than 12 N. Preferably the peeling force is between 2 and 9 N, particularly between 2.5 and 6 N. The sealing together of layers of film generally takes place by means of heated bars between which the layers of film are squeezed on to each other at a bar temperature of about 125 to 150 C. Such a temperature can be applied also in the sealing of the sealing layer according to the invention. Then however, the seal is not peelable anymore. So if for the bottom of the bag a non peelable seal is desired, it is not necessary to make special provisions for that purpose, which is an advantage of the invention. In the customary equipment vertical form , fill and sealing machine the bag is filled with the contents 1n question while the seal is still hot. Letting the seal cool would involve too long a waiting period and consequently result in inefficiency. That is why under the sudden weight, the hot seal must be sufficiently strong. The force required to peel off half of a seal having a width of 35 mm imme diately after the sealing is called hot tack . With a seal according to the invention having a width of 35 mm this is at least 150 g and mostly more than 175 g if a bar temperature of 125 150 C, particularly 125 135 C, is applied. If the sealing temperature is lowered, there is a danger of obtaining a very poor seal, or none at all. The sealing layer according to the invention preferably allows 1tself to be sealed down to a good peelable seal at a temperature between 70 and 125 C, particularly between 80 and 120 C, and preferably below 110 C. When a high packaging speed is required, the sealing temperature to achieve the treshold value for the seal to be peelable, is desired to be low e.g. 80 C. In that case the use of an 1 octene LLDPE with a low density, e.g. between 900 and 910 kg m³ is preferred. It is to be recommended that the sealing range of the sealing layer should be wide, e.g. between 10 and 20 . Sealing range is understood here to mean the temperature range in which a good, peelable seal is formed. If this temperature range is too small, fluctuations in the temperature of the sealing equipment may have unacceptable consequences, such as an unpeelable seal, or a seal which becomes detached prematurely. The sealing layer is preferably between 5 and 15 µ thick in order to provide favourable properties. The laminated film from which the multilayer bag of the invention is prepared can be produced in a manner known per se such as, for instance, by means of cast or blown film extrusion. Adhesive layers may also be present. The multilayer bags according to the invention may be made out of film with a sealing layer on one side, but it is also possible to produce the bag out of film provided with a sealing layer on both surfaces. The bags may be made out of one piece of film, which is folded and sealed, but also out of e.g. two pieces of film which are contacted and sealed. Especially advantageous is the use of a multilayer film with limited water vapour transmission less than 6 g m². 24 hr, preferably less than 4.5 g m². 24 hr in view of the fact that peelable seal bags find a wide application in food packaging. Such a film may be prepared by blown film extrusion, but the use of cast film offers advantages such as high output and no special requirements as to the accomodation of the film line. It comprises by preference a layer of ethylenehomopolymer having a density above 940 kg m³ HDPE and is obtainable by passing the polymers in melted condition via an extruder through a rectangular slit and subsequently cooling, optionally stretching and rolling them up, the temperature of the first cooling roll being at least 50 C and at most 100 C, preferably at least 60 C. The use of a film consisting of a first layer of polypropylene, a second layer of HDPE and a third layer of a blend according to the invention, offers good results in the packaging of food. The use of HDPE with a density above 955 kg m³ and a melt index between 1 and 12 dg min. is recommended. The invention will now be elucidated by means of examples without, however, being limited thereto. A coextrudate was produced with a first layer of 10 µ PP homopolymer, MI 5.5. dg min, a second layer of 22 µ HDPE, d 963 kg m³, MI 8 dg min, with, as a sealing layer, a blend of 85 wt C₈ LLDPE, d 915 kg m³, MI 4.4 dg min and 15 wt PP calculated on the total sealing layer was coextruded on a cast film line, the temperature of the first cooling roll being 20 C. The thickness of the sealing layer was 8 µ. A seal was made using an apparatus of the firm of Bruggen, type HSG ETK, at a bar temperature of 110 C, a sealing time of 1 sec. and a sealing pressure of 3 kg cm². The peeling force required to open the seal is measured in the same manner as in the opening of a bag, i.e. from the middle of the seal, which was determined by folding the 10 cm long seal in the middle, fixing the two ends 1n the draw clamps of a tensile tester and peeling the seal off at a rate of 20 cm min. The water vapour transmission WVT was measured by dividing a cell into two compartments by means of a piece of film. In one compartment the relative humidity of the atmosphere is 100 at 38 C through the second compartment a non preheated, dry nitrogen flow was passed. This flow takes up the water let through and delivers it again to an electrode covered with phosphorus pentoxide. Owing to the take up of water the electric resistance of the electrode changes this change, measured with a calibrated ammeter, shows the amount of water of the sample, and with it the WVT of the film. The peeling force of the peelable seal, measured as described above, was 6 N the water vapour transmission was 7,0 g m² . 24 hr. The same coextrudate as in Ex. 1 was sealed at a bar temperature of 130 C. The force required for peeling the seal off was 15 N. In the process delamination occurred between the sealing layer and the PP layer. The same coextrudate as in Ex. 1 was sealed at a bar temperature of 90 C. The peeling force was 1 N. The same coextrudate as in ex. 1 was produced with a temperature of the first cooling roll of 70 C. The peeling properties of the sealing layer remained unchanged, but the water vapour transmission was 4.0 g m² . 24 hr. A film of polypropylene homopolymer, MI 5.5 dg min with a sealing layer of 80 wt C₈ LLDPE, d 915 kg m³, MI 4.4 dg min, and 20 wt PP, MI 5.5 dg min, was coextruded as in example 1. The seal was 8 µ thick. A seal was formed at a bar temperature of 110 C. The peeling force was 2 N. The same coextrudate as in Ex. 5 was sealed at a bar temperature of 130 C. The peeling force was 16 N in the process delamination occurred between sealing layer and PP layer. The same coextrudate as in Ex. 5 was sealed at a bar temperature of 95 C. The peeling force was 1 N. A PP film with a sealing layer of 100 wt C₈ LLDPE, d 915 kg m³, MI 4.4 dg min, was coextruded and subsequently sealed at a bar temperature of 110 C. The peeling force was 14 N. In the process delamination occurred between the sealing layer and the PP layer. A film of polypropylene homopolymer, MI 5.5 dg min with a sealing layer of 80 wt C₈ LLDPE, d 906 kg ³, MI 2.5 dg min and 20 wt PP, MI 5,5 dg min was coextruded as in example 1. A seal was made at a bar temperature of 85 C. The peeling force was 2 N. The same coextrudate as in ex. 9 was sealed at a bar temperature of 95 C. The peeling force was 6 N. The same coextrudate as in ex. 9 was sealed at a bar temperature of 65 C. No seal was formed. The same coextrudate as in ex. 9 was sealed at a bar temperature of 125 C. The peeling force was 15 N delamination between sealing layer and PP layer occurred. A film of polypropylene homopolymer, MI 5.5 dg min with a sealing layer of 80 wt. C₈ LLDPE, d 902 kg m³, MI 2.3 dg min, and 20 wt. PP, MI 5.5 dg min was coextruded as in example 1. A seal was made at a bar temperature of 80 C. The peeling force was 3 N.
