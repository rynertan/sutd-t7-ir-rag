# Long wavelength, low loss optical waveguide.

## Abstract
An optical fibre waveguide is disclosed of the type com prising an outer cladding layer, an axially disposed core of SiO₂ doped with GeO₂ and a first inner ciadding layer of SiO₂ doped with an oxide such as P₂O₅ for lowering the preform processing temperature. A second inner cladding layer of pure SiO₂ is disposed between the first inner cladding layer and the core to prevent P₂O₅ from diffusing into the core, thereby eliminating absorption losses from the P O H band in the 1.1 1.8 µm region.
