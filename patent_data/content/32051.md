# Structural component and a method for its manufacture.

## Abstract
Lightweight component comprising hollow,tubular member A with load transmission means B at its ends and filaments E in a plastic matrix C encircling the member and transmission means may be used as tension compression member. The tubular member preferably is a pultrusion adapted to contain sufficient filaments to tensilely strengthen the component. The component may be made, for example, by winding or wrapping filaments about the member while load transmission means are at its ends.
