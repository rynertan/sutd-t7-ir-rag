## Abstract
Apparatus for filtering air for a powder spray booth. A fan plenum 11 is fixed in an elavated position and has a lower edge 20 lying in an inclined plane. The filter module 12 has an upper edge 22 lying in an inclined plane and has an elastomeric compressible gasket 23 around its edge. The filter module is mounted on wheels 24 so that it can be rolled into edge to edge engagement with the plenum and clamped in that position.
