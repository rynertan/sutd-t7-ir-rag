# An intraoral dental appliance for orthopedically correcting class II malocclusions.

## Abstract
An orthopedic appliance for correcting an abnormal, Class II malocclusion. In the latter the mandible and its teeth are pos teriorly displaced resulting in improper biting and impaired physical appearance. The appliance has upper and lower an choring means for securement to any respectively upper and lower tooth functioning as a first molar and upper and lower links pivoted to respectively the upper and lower anchoring means wherein a strut of adjustable length is pivoted between the free ends of the upper and lower links, and in use, the upper and lower links extend respectively backwards and forwards, and the strut extends generally downwards and forwards, whereby an outward force is extended on the lower jaw when closing the mouth. The point of attachment to the lower row of teeth is somewhat forward of the corresponding point in the upper row so that the lower jaw is forced forward when the mouth is closed. In adolescents, and to some extent in adults, this produces permanent muscle changes of the lower jaw and its joint, bone remodeling and permanent correction of the oc clusion to a normal Class I bite.
