# Microprocessor controllable automatic sampler.

## Abstract
An apparatus for automatically establishing fluid commu nication between a probe 52 and a plurality of containers pre sented in the sequence to a sampling position includes a con tainer supported rack 54 movable into and out of the sam pling position. A probe holder 53 supports the probe for movement into and out of the sampling position. A drive unit 126, 170, 261, 262 connects to the rack and probe holder for includes a first pressure fluid operated motor 126 actuable effecting and controlling the movements thereof. The drive unit for moving the probe into and out of the sampling position for communication with a container thereat and a second pres sure fluid operated motor 176 actuable for causing the rack to move a desired one of the containers into the sampling posi tion, the first and second pressure fluid operated motors being actuable independently of each other from a common source of pressure fluid. The apparatus is connectible to provide se quential samples for an analysis system 11, 13, 18 , such as a high pressure liquid chromatography system. In a preferred embodiment the sampler apparatus includes an onboard mi croprocessor circuit 350 programmable to control sequen cing of the pressure fluid motors and timing of the chromatog raphy system. This is in addition to an external computer 394 for processing information resulting from analysis of the sam ples provided by the sampler apparatus.
