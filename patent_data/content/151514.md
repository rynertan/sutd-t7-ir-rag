# Self regulated actuator.

## Abstract
A self regulated actuator is disclosed having a shape memory element which is heated preferably by passing electrical current therethrough and having a reset mechanism including a circuit breaking mechanism. The shape memory element provides the force to retract the actuator when heated. The reset mechanism utilizes a spring biased latch plunger that resets the actuator as soon as it has retracted a specific distance. The reset mechanism also acts as a circuit breaking mechanism to electrically interrupt current heating the shape memory element. The reset mechanism provides near instant reset time and overcomes the longer wait period otherwise associated with the natural cooling of the shape memory element. The reset mechanism prevents overheating of the shape memory element and precludes the necessity for additional hardware to interrupt the circuit after actuation is completed. Also discussed is a self protection means that protects the shape memory element from deliberate and accidental overloads and to accommodate the extra motion required for high cycle design life.
