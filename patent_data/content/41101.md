# A method of electrochemically etching a semiconductor wafer.

## Abstract
A method of electrochemically etching a semiconductor wafer 10 to a predetermined contour includes positioning at least one electrode 12A, 12B, 12C on one side of the semi conductor wafer 10 and then applying a voltage to the elec trodes 12A, 12B, 12C so as to generate a varying current density vertically through the semiconductor wafer 10 and electrochemically etching the mask free other side of the semiconductor wafer 10 .
