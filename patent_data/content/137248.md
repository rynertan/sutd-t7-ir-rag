# METHOD AND CIRCUIT FOR DC MOTOR FIELD REGULATION WITH SPEED FEEDBACK

## Abstract
A method and a circuit for motor field regulation in the constant horsepower speed range, wherein the weakening of field current allows operation of the motor 11, 12 at speeds higher than the base speed while maintaining rated armature voltage. The field current is weakened in response to speed feedback signals supplied to a field weakening circuit 37 to provide a rapid response in controlling field current. The motor field 12 is also regulated in response to a counter EMF and IR compensation circuit 60, 61 to further weaken the field current, where the counter EMF developed in the DC motor would cause excessive voltage across the armature 11 .
