# Flux composition.

## Abstract
A solder flux composition undergoes a visible colour change at a critical temperature. Solderable substrates are positioned within the device and heated until a critical tem perature has been reached as indicated by a colour change in the flux. The critical temperature depends on the material of the particular heat recoverably member and the solder used. Flux compositions and their use in soldering are also disclosed.
