# Improvements in crushers.

## Abstract
Improvements in crushers, particularly for wood waste comprise a container 1 having at least one inlet opening 3 and at least one outlet opening 4 for the waste and a plurality of mutually cooperating, feeding and disintegrating screws 6 as well as driving means for rotating the screws. To make possible an extensive disintegration of the material in the crusher each screw is provided at its one end, which is located adjacent to the outlet opening 4 of the container, with a substantially plane cutting means 11 which has at least one cutting edge and is located in a plane, which is substantially perpendicular to the rotational axis of the screw. At least one knife 23 or the like is secured to the container at its outlet opening, closely by the movement path of the cutting means, for further disintegration of the material just disintegrated in the crusher in cooperation with said cutting means.
