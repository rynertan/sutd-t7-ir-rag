# Solar heat collector.

## Abstract
A solar heat collector comprises an evacuated transpa rent pipe 1 a solar heat collection plate 7 disposed in the transparent pipe 1 , a heat pipe 3 disposed in the transparent pipe 1 so as to contact with the solar heat collection plate 7 , and containing an evaporable working liquid therein a heat medium pipe 11 containing a heat medium to be heated a heat releasing fin portion 131 extending from the axis to the inner surface of the heat medium pipe 11 and a cylindrical casing 9 surrounding coaxially the heat medium pipe 11 to provide an annular space 11 communicating with the heat pipe 3 . The evaporable working liquid evaporates, receiving solar heat collected by the heat collection plate 7 . The resultant vapor heats the heat medium through the heat medium pipe 11 and the heat releasing member 130 .
