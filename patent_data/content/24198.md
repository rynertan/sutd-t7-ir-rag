# Mixed fiber length yarn.

## Abstract
A novel synthetic yarn disclosed which comprises fibers of different lengths as specified . At least three groups of synthetic fibers are present in the yarn, with the synthetic fibers within each group being substantially uniform in length. The substantially uniform length of each group of synthetic fibers present in the yarn differs from the substan tially uniform length of the synthetic fibers in the other groups. The use of such mixtures of fiber lengths in a synthe tic yarn enables the yarn to exhibit physical characteristics such as high bulk which more closely resemble the charac teristics of natural fiber containing yarns. Fabrics having improved physical characteristics may also be produced from the novel synthetic yarns disclosed.
