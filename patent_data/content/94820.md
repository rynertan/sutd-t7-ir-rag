# Method and apparatus for manufacturing a composite steel ingot.

## Abstract
In manufacture of composite steel ingot, a consumed electrode 11 is inserted into an empty space concentric with the ingot 10, and electroslag remelting is effected under a slag bath 16 and the molten metal solidifies. Current is taken out through a plurality of collecting electrodes 12 electrically connected to the ingot. To obtain improvement in the uniformity of depth of fusion of the ingot, the flow path of the electric current passing from the consumed electrode to the collecting electrodes is moved in the circumferential direc tion of the ingot during the electroslag remelting, e.g. by rotating either or both of the ingot and the collecting electrodes. Further improvement may be achieved by varying the speed of movement of this flow path as the slag bath ascends the ingot.
