# Venting and anti pollution device for a shipboard liquid storage tank.

## Abstract
A combination venting and antipollution device for a shipboard liquid storage tank. A closure wall 30 divides the vent conduit into a lower tank chamber 18 in direct communication with the tank 19 and an upper vent space 35 in direct communication with the vent opening 36 . A spring urged valve closure member 50 opens or closes an opening 31 through the closure wall. Low pressure in the tank 19 moves the valve closure member 50 down into a lower open position, to admit air or other fluid to the tank high pressure in the tank 19 moves the valve closure member 50 up into an upper open position to vent air from the tank 19 . A hydrostatic pressure chamber 88, 89 open to the atmosphere houses a sealed bellows 80 , and a spill lock valve 76 secured to the bellows 80 normally opens to the vent a spill lock chamber 70 on the vent side of the valve closure member 50 . However, when the pressure in the pressure chamber 88, 89 or manual action compresses the bellows 80 as when the ship sinks , the bellows 80 moves the spill lock valve 76 to close the connection to the vent and cause the fluid from the tank chamber 19 to flow into the spill lock chamber 70 , to bear upon a spill lock piston 52 there. In this condition, the tank pressure acts on the spill lock piston 52 to prevent the valve closure member 50 from moving up into its upper position until the pressure in the tank chamber 19 is well above that then present in the vent space 35 , but the tank pressure does not restrain the valve closure member 50 from moving down into its lower open position. Salvage operation is also provided for.
