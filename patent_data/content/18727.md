# A coil supporting device for use in stacking toroidal coils, and a loading coil assembly.

## Abstract
A one piece, moulded coil supporting device 24 comprises a coil support 26 from which upstands a coil locating structure 28 , for receiving a toroidal coil 2 , and an electrical connector 36 for connecting the coil windings 14, 16 to leads 20, 22 . For stacking coils 2 in axially aligned relationship, the connector 36 is joined to the support 26 by a flexible arm 38 and has on one side 40 , first fingers 86 for latching in a first hole 32 at the upper end of the locating structure 28 and on the opposite side, second fingers 88 for latching in a second hole 34 at the lower end of the locating structure 28 of a further and identical coil supporting device. The invention also concerns a load coil assembly in which stacks of load coils are assembled by means of such coil supporting devices 24 .
