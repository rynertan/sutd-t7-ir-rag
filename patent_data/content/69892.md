# Container closure.

## Abstract
A closure for a container having a radial groove on an inside surface of the mouth of the container includes a lid portion having a central disk with an upstanding wall at the periphery of the disk for contacting the inside surface of the mouth of the container. A plurality of radial projections are provided on an outside surface of the upstanding wall. A region of the upstanding wall surrounding each radial projection is substantially thinner than the remaining por tions of the upstanding wall so as to impart radial flexibility between the plurality of projections in the remaining por tions of the upstanding wall. Actuating means such as a ring axially displaceable with respect to the upstanding wall is provided radially inside the upstanding wall for radially displacing the plurality of projections for engagement with the radial groove on the inside surface of the mouth of the container.
