# A SPIRAL STAIRCASE

## Abstract
The invention relates to a spiral staircase which features adjustable rise, and whose structure is obtained by the assembly in reciprocal fashion of identical modular com ponents 1 fitted one on top of the next, each component 1 comprising a cylindrical section 2 , to which either a step 4 or the support 3 for a separate tread 4 is fixed direct. Each cylindrical section 2 consists of an upper part 6 and a lower part 7 , these coaxially disposed and provided with means for their being paired by screwing, as well as with alignment surfaces which enable the upper part 6 of each component 1 to insert coaxially into the lower part 7 of any of the other components 1 , thus remaining stably associated therewith following assembly and creating a single, solid structure in consequence. The type of pairing envisaged permits adjustment of the stair rise that is, the distance between two successive treads, and therefore between the two modular components them selves, once assembled.
