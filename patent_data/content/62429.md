## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO OPTICAL DEVICES. The present invention relates to optical devices and more particularly to optical couplers, switches wavelength combiners etc. wherein light is modified in direction or form. In particular the invention is concerned with light transmitted along optical fibres. Many known optical fibre couplers, switches, wavelength combiners, etc. use expanded beam techniques.These techniques use a small lens or mirror to manipulate a beam of light much larger than the fibre to achieve this function, the light being ultimately reimaged down onto the original, or another fibre or ofcourse a source or detector. The basic device of this type, from which others are derived, may be regarded as being a device that reflects the light emerging from a fibre back into itself. Types of device using this principle are shown in the figures 1 and 2. Although these expanded beam devices may allow the relaxing of tolerances in some respects compared to the equivalent fibre only device the tolerancing on the crucial fibre transverse positioning is not improved. However, according to the present invention, by replacing the mirror with a retroflector such as a corner cube a device can be made in which the image will rack the object as it is moved in any sideways direction. Axial tolerances are not improved but these are less critical in any case. According to the present invention there is therefore provided an optical fibre connection device comprising a retroreflector, means for holding a first optical fibre in a first position in front of the retroreflector such that light emitted from said first optical fibre is received and reflected by the retroreflector along a defined path so as to be received at the plane of the first optical fibre at a defined second position with respect to said first position said device being such that within the working angle of said retroreflector the first position maybe varied whilst maintaining the relative distance between said first and second positions. In a first preferred embodiment the retroreflector is formed by a corner cube prism and in a second preferred embodiment the retroreflector is formed by a concave mirror and convex mirror arrangement. The present invention also provides an optical switching coupler comprising a retroreflector, means for holding a rotatable optical fibre combination in position in front of and within the working angle of said retroreflector, said optical fibre combination comprising a first optical fibre capable of emitting light to be reflected by said retroreflector and one or more further optical fibres displaced a fixed distance apart from said first optical fibre in a fixed relationship, in which the retroreflector is modified by alteration of one or more reflection angles to displace the reflected beam by an amount equal to said fixed distance when said reflected beam reaches said optical fibre combination. Preferably the first optical fibre is held in a central position and the further optical fibres are arranged symetrically and concentrically around first optical fibre. The retroreflector used may in a preferred embodiment be a corner cube prism with one face offset from 900 with respect to its adjoining face by a small angle. The optical fibre combination is preferably rotatable around the central optical fibre. In a further embodiment a dichroic mirror surface maybe positioned within the corner cube prism, its face being offset from 900 such that light of the wavelength reflectable by the dichroic mirror is reflected back to a different position from other wavelengths of light. Thus a wavelength seperator and or optical switching coupler maybe produced. The optical fibres maybe held accurately in position by mounting them in V shaped grooves etched in silicon blocks or by other known accurate mounting means. Optical lens means is preferably used between the optical fibre or optical fibre combination and the retroreflector to focus the light beam out of and into the optical fibres. The present invention also provides an optical fibre connection device comprising means for holding the optical fibre or fibres in a fixed relationship with respect to the retroreflector, said means being detatchable for disconnection. Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figures 1 and 2 show known optical fibre connection devices. Figure 3 shows a first optical connection device in accordance with the present invention employing a corner cube prism as retroreflector, Figure 4 shows a second optical connection device in accordance with the present invention employing a concave and convex mirror retroreflector arrangement, Figure 5 shows a Frisnel bi prism arrangement which when used in conjunction with the arrangement of figure 3 or figure 4 will provide two tracking images, Figure 6 shows a third optical connection device similar to figure 3 but including a dichroic mirror surface within the corner cube prism offset from one face of the prism, Figure 7 shows a switching coupler using a corner cube retro prism with one off 900 face, Figure 8 shows the rotatable optical fibre combination device used to secure the optical fibres in position in the arrangement of figure 7, and Figure 9 shows a connector emboding the corner cube retro prism as shown in figure 3. Referring now to the drawings it maybe seen that in the arrangement of figure 1 or figure 2 the vertical or horizontal displacement of the end of the optical fibre 1 from its position will cause problems because the reflected beam will not return to that spot. Thus the positioning of the fibre is critical. In the arrangement of figure 3 or 4 however the retroreflector used causes the reflected beam to track the fibre as it is moved to any position 18. Thus any beam emitted by the fibre will return to the same fibre providing that the corner cube prism 2 or concave and concave mirror arrangements 3,4 are accurate. The corner cube prism 2 is shown for simplicity as an angle in two dimensions only but will of course comprise mirrors in three dimensions. The mirrors shown in Figure 4 are concentric.In practice however M2 maybe planer, with some loss of performance. Central obstruction will generally be minimal. Other alternative forms of retroreflector may be used for example, a length of graded index rod with a plane mirror at the end. Useful devices maybe made from these any ofFigures 1 4 in some cases using extra components.For example the use of a Fresnel bi prism, Figure 5, close to the mirror M1 or lens will give two tracking images either side of the input fibre at spacings determined by the prism angle. If other fibres are placed at these points a splitter is obtained. The relative positions of these fibres may easily be accurately controlled using, for example, precision etched silicon V grooves. Variations of this using a dispersive prism or a diffraction grating to achieve wavelength separated images are obvious. A similar effect could be achieved in Figure 3 by using slightly tilted dichroic mirrors one behind the other as one face of the corner cube Figure 6 . A grating might also be used here and a split face, with different parts tilted differently, could replace the bi prism. A particularly simple way to produce a splitter is to use a corner cube with off 900 interfacial angles. Thiscanbe arranged to produce 2, 4 or 6 spots according to the description below. The division of power is mode along diameters in the far field, and is thus made unselective. The following is a description of the mode of operation of an imperfect corner cube. A corner cube maybe regarded as constructed of three mutually perpendicular roof prisms, each of which returns a ray deflected at an angle of 2 60 where SO is the angle by which the roof angle differs from 900, and the sign depends upon the direction in which the ray appears viewed from the front to cross the roof apex. In the complete cube all rays of interest are reflected from each face once and therefore cross the line of each roof apex a reflection of this in the opposite face is equally counted. The negligible proportion of rays striking the vertex of the cube is ignored. If the directions across each apex are labelled consistently ie. in a similar way it can easily be shown that the signs of the angular tilts always alternate. Rays may therefore cross the 3 roofs with any combination of signs except all ve or all ve.Since the individual roof angles may each be ve or ve ie. or 900 , this does not restrict the combinations achieved, but merely restricts the number of arrangements of 3 signs achieved by any one cube to 6 of the possible 8. The angular deflection of any one beam of the six possible as above is a sum of 3 vectors in angular space ie. on a diagram of Ox vs Oy orientated at 1200 intervals and each of a magnitude related to the angle of one of the roofs according to deflection EMI8.1 with the angle o defined as before. The factorEMI8.2 arises because the roof prism is tilted away from the normal. The six possible spots are obtained by adding the 3 vectors with any combination of signs,except for two as indicated above. This gives the six output beam directions needed to make the 6 way splitter.If one of the roofs is exactly 900 max. interfacial angle there will of course be only 4 spots, but two will be bright and two dim. If two faces are perfect right angles there will be just two output spots equally bright. All spots appear in diametrically opposite pairs, and it is, unfortunately, not possible to obtain 6 in a single row, the nearest being 4 in a row with two out of line. To produce a connector as shown in Figure 7 a retro prism with a slightly tilted face is used.This reflects the beam back to two defined points close to the original source and hence if a receiving fibres are mounted at those point in accurate fixed relationships to the emitting fibre the light will transfer. A switching coupler as shown in Figure 8 maybe produced by using the arrangement of Figure 7, the switching action being performed by rotation of the prism about the system axis A A1. By this means any two of several output fibres may be selected.The specific advantage of this form of switch lies again in terms of insensitivity to both angular and spatial movement of the retroprism or similar moving part sse.figures 2, 3 etc. The key advantage of these techniques is the relaxing of fibre positioning tolerances and a switch coupler incorporating the corner cube prism arrangement is shown in figure 9. By using an imperfect oneface off 900 corner cube prism of course an optical switch coupler can be constructed using the principles described above.
