## Description
This invention relates to a method of ultrasonically sealing or welding sheet materials, and apparatus implementiag said method. Currently known is a method of welding sheet materials of woven and non woven fabrics, even of a non porousorfibrous natre, throtigh the application of ultrasonic vibration of suitable power, instead of traditional sewing. However, that method can only be applied to some thermoplastics materials, which are either synthetical throughout or include an amount of natural fibers not exceeding about 350A. Thus, there remain non susceptible of such an application a number of knovai and currently marketed synthetic materials, such as DRALON t VICOSAII, 11RAYON 1, etc., materials having up to 100 natural fibers, and paper, cardboard, and the like. moreover, direct welding of materials from the first mentioned group, having a different nature from each other, is almost always impossible. Purthermore, there are instances of materials which,while being directly weldable together by ultrasonic vibration, do not yield optimum strength welds on accouift of their small thickness and width of the fabric mesh, as in the case of gauze or nets. These factors have so farhindcred a viider application of ultrasonic welding to the particular textile industry field. This invention sets out to provide a method which enables ultrasonic welding to be employed with any fibrous or porous materials, whether of the woven or non woven types, regardless of the percentages of natural fibers contained therein, and an apparatus for implementing the method, which is a multi purpose one also suitable for carrying out conventional welding processes when the materials allow it. Within that general aim, it can be arranged that the method and apparatus according to the invention are quite simple, can provide a fast and strong weld which cannot damage the. welded materials, the weld being almost unseparable. It can be further arranged that the apparatus of this invention allows the materials to be cut and edge finished during the welding process. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of ultrasonically welding sheet materials, characterized in that it comprises the steps of interposing between two flaps of said sheet materials and along the desired weld line a strip or yarn of a thermoplastics material, and of melting said strip or yarn to penetrate the texture of said materials by application to the overlapping flaps of ultrasonic vibration generating means.In one embodiment of the invention, the strip may be either gauze or net. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for implementing the aforesaid method, characterized in that it comprises a device supplying and inserting a strip or yarn of a theroplastic material between two flaps of such sheet materials, a welding station having ultrasonic vibration generating means, a station for cutting said thermoplastic strip and located downstream of said welding station, and a device for entraining said sheet materials with said thermoplastic strip therebetween. However, where direct welding of materials which allow it is preferable, said apparatus can be readily converted into a continuous or spot welder of a novel type, making use of the conventional method. The features of this invention will become more clearly apparent from a detailed description of a preferred embodiment of an apparatus for ultrasonically welding sheet materials, as shown by way of example in the accompanying drawings,where Figure 1 illustrates schematically the apparatus mode of operation Figure 2 is a partly sectional front view of the apparatus Figure 3 is a plan view of the apparatus ofFigure 2 Figure 4 is a side view of the apparatus ofFigure 2 Figures 5,6,7 and 8 show different embodiments of a guide for said strip between the flaps of the material to be welded Figure 9 shows a tool for cutting and welding the materials in one operation Figures 10 and 11 are respectively a fragmentary elevational view of two different embodiments of thts apparatus Figures 12,13 and 14 show further embodiments of a guide for said strip between the flaps of the materials to be welded and Figures 15,16,17, and 18 illustrate a portable type of embodiment of this same apparatus. With reference to the drawing figures, there is indicated at 1 a strip of a thermoplastic material of small thickness dimension of preference, that material comprises a transparent or clear polywnide, polypropylene, or other suitable material, In the instance of materials to be welded directly together in the form of thin sheets or gauze or net, it is expedient that the welding strip or yarn be made of the same material. Tile strip 1 is inserted between two flaps 2,3 of woven or no n vioven sheet materials, as shown schematically in Figure 1.The overlapping flaps 2,3 are clamped between an ultrasonic resonator tool 4 and an anvil 5. The tool 4 must be sufficiently powerful to fuse the strip 1, without damaging the flaps 2,3, and have a slightly greater width than the overlap area, such as to reliably weld the ends of the flaps themselves and create no favorable conditions for separation balder peeling stresses. The anvil 5 iruist be formed, at least for its portion contacting the materials to be welded, from materials mrhiQb are at the same tirae good thermal insulators arid do not absorb the vibration. Normally, metals and alloys will be employed in the case of small thickness dimensions of the materials. to be united together, the invention provides for the use of granite or similar rocks, or epoxy resins of a suitable type. Thus, a quick dissipation of the heat generated is avoided, and the efficiency of the apparatus increased. The working surface of the anvil may carry an embossed pattern which would be duplicated on the pack of thelmaterials to be united, especially in the case of direct welding. Therefore, it can be readily dismantled to vary the dimensions and welding procedure. The strip 1 is wound around a reel 6 which can rotate about a pivot pin 7 secured under a bench 8 of the apparatus. The pivot pin 7 is inclined such as to allow the strip 1 to be paid off and passed through a slot 9 in the bench 8. Above the bench 8, the strip 1 is caught in the nip between a pair of small rollers 10, one of which is rotatable about a stationary pin and the other rotatable about a pin which is made movable to spring load, through a spring not shown, the strip between said rollers. The rotation of the reel 6 should occur on a bushing or bearing which is slightly braked to prevent the reel momentum from relaxing the tension in the run of the strip 1 extending between the reel and small rollers 10. The rollers 10 have their rotation axes inclined on the plane of the bench 8, to thus direct the strip 1, parallel to said plane, into a guide 11 Figure 2 , which serves the function of positioning the strip 1 and flaps 2,3 of the materials to be united with respect to one another, and enabling them to slide nthout mutually interfering with one another. The guide 11, as shown in detail in Figure 5, is substantially composed of a small block 12 which defines downwardly a side detent for the lower flap 3 and a centrally located slot or passage chc meel for the strip 1. Above the block 12, a bracket 13 can be attached which acts as a side detent for the upper flap 2. The block 12 is protected, in its working position, by a cover 14 which extends above the rollers 10. In Figure 6, there is shown the guide 11 with the bracket 13 mounted in the reverse direction on the block 12, thus enabling the welding operation to be carried out on the flaps 2,3 with the sheets arranged on the same side, e.g. to form bags. In the case of materials which can be welded directly, and having a small thickness dimension or being in the form of gauze or nets, the strip can be positioned externally, which is specially convenient when bags are being manufactured thus, the sheets are overlaid on each other and both their flaps caused to utilize one and the same detent. Figure 7 shows o the block 12 is used without the bracket 13 for bordering one flap only of the material, which is wound around the block. Figure 8 shows the use of a block of elongate shape, as indicated at 12a, which enables the formation along one flap of the material of a longitudinal tube for the insertion of supports or the like therethrough. The tool 4 is mounted coaxially below a transducer 15 Figure 2 which is effective to generate altrasonicvibration,with the possible interposition of an intermediate resonator 16, which elements constitute a single vibrating assembly. The direction of the vibratory movement is perpendicular to the weld surface. The entire vibrating assembly is supported at the center, that is where the longitudinal vibrations have minimal amplitudes, by means of a clamp 17 which is connected to an arm 18 extending from one side of the bench 8. The clamp 17 is provided with a fine pitch height adjustment screw, not shown in the drawing because of conventional construction. At the vibrating assembly, below the bench 8, a pneumatic cylinder 19, adjustably supplied with pressurized air to achieve the best welding conditions, actuates the anvil 5 which is caused to slide on guides 20. The cylinder 19 is fed through a solenoid valve 21. The materials being treated are caused to advance intermittently under the drive of an electric motor 22 and through a speed reducer 23, electromagnetic clutch brake assembly 24, cam 25 actuating a microswitch 26, and driving wheel 27 Figure 4 . The entire drive assembly is carried under the bench 8 only the wheel 2T protruding with a peripheral portion thereof above the latter through a specially provided opening. With the driving wheel 27, there cooperates a bias wheel 28, which is mounted idle or slightly braked through a suitable frictional clutch mounted at the end of a rod 29 carried by the arm 18. The biasing wheel 28 applies a pressure force which can be adjusted through a spring 30. The apparatus also comprises a strip cutting station including a second pneumatic cylinder 31 equipped with a cutting blade 32. The pneumatic cylinder 31 is secured to the arm 18 downstream of the vibrating assembly in the direction of advancement of the strip 1. The apparatus operates as follows. After removing the cover 14, the strip 1 is inserted into the block 12 of the guide 11, and caused to advance until its end reaches the anvil 5.After reinstalling the cover 14, the operator then brings the flaps 2,3 of the materials to be united against the longitudinal detents of the block 12 ma brackets 13, with the ends equally flush vgith the anvil 5, thereby the strip 1 is included between the two materials. in the manner made clear already in Figures 6,7,8, it is possible to position the flaps differently on the guide, for carrying out special treatments. This method of welding vath the strip 1 can also be employed for packs having more than two layers, on condition that the thickness of the strip be selected such as to penetrate all the layers involved. Through a control pushbutton or pedal of the apparatus, the operator energizes then the solenoid valve 21 actuating the pneumatic cylinder 19 which raises the anvil 5 to compress the flaps 2,3 and strip 1 interposed against the tool 4. Thus, an initial section or portion of the materials is welded, under the effect of the ultrasonic vibration .1 causipg the strip 1 to melt and penetrate the pores of the flaps 2,3.A suitable timer controls the welding time, and de energizes the solenoid valve 21 at the end of it. By arranging the coil or reel 6 on one side and below the bench 8, the operator is allowed to stand in front of the apparatus. By contrast, in fully automatic apparatus, the strip 1 may be fed frontally, voth the reel 6 located centrally between those of the materials to beJoined. After welding the initial section, the operator introduces that section between the driving wheel 27 and biasing idle wheel 28. From now onwards, the apparatus operation is automatic, with an intermittent or reciprocating type of operation. That is, after completing the welding step, the anvil 5 is dropped to cause, through an electric control, the actuation of the clutch brake assembly 24 connected to the motor 22 then, the driving wheel 27 completes a rotation arc to cause the materials to advance together, preferably over a slightly shorter distance than the weld length, thereby a continuous weld can be achieved. The switching over of the clutch brake assembly 24 is controlled by the cam 25 acting on the microswitch 26 this same controlling operation also produces, alternatively, the upward movement of the anvil 5.Upon completion of the welding of the two flaps 2,3, the strip 1 must be cut, which is effected by the blade 32 actuated, under control by the operator, by the second pneumatic cylinder 31. If it is desired that the cutting step be automated, it is possible to provide a photocell type of control, thanks to the strip 1 being transparent, but on condition that the mate rials to be Joined do not happen to be transparent.Alternatively, it will be possible to install a side feeler adapted for detecting the absence of materials to be united together. In either case, the energization of such devices will also bring the machine to a stop. The emission of ultrasonic vibration may be either continuous or controlled by a timer, depending on the operating rate of the apparatus.At low rates, a timed or clocked emission is preferable to spare energy and prevent overheatiRg of the transducer. Anyho, a power ren,ulÅator is suitably provided for optimizing the welding in accordance with the required speed of advancement. In some cases, it will be necessary to cut the welded materials, edge to obtain two pieces of the material with welded, and thus non frayed, edges, or slots. The above cutting operation may advantageously be carried out simultaneously with the welding operation, by utilizing a tool 33, as shovm inFigure 9. The vibrating tool 33 carries at its end a knife edge 34 having a slightly smaller height than the pack of the materials, to accommodate the slight reduction in thickness which results from the yielding process. The welding surface of the tool 33 is the flat one on one side of the knife edge. It is also possible to effect the cutting subsequently to the welding, without prejudice for the non fraying feature of the edges. To this aim, it will be necessary to install a pair of sharpened wheels like the ones equipping cutters successively to the driving station. Similar in principle to the cutting is the formation of buttonholes or holes.The welded region should completely surround the buttoniwle or hole. If the operation is carried out simultaneously, wvith the tool vibrating at ultrasonic frequencies, its working surface will be as shown in Figure 9 but with the cutting edge totally included within the perimeter. The apparatus described hereinabove may also be made fully electropneumatically operated, by replacing the electromechanical group of the driving station with a rotary piston also called pneumatic actuator and a free wheel mechanism. Figure 10 is a fragmentary view of a fully electromechanical variation of the apparatus, which is accordingly suitable for a non industrial application as wells In this apparatus, the reciprocation of the anvil 5 is controlled by a cam 35, which comprises two parts extending each substantially over one half of the circumference, with different curvature radii. The cam 35 turns in contact with a small wheel 36 which is mounted rotatably on the end of a rod 37 having a return spring 38. A ring nut 39 allows the compression of the spring 38 to be adjusted. The rod is terminated at the top with a support or holder 40 for the anvil 5 which is guided on pins 41. T luss the anvil can be removed to vary the dimensions or pattern of the weld. The cam 35 is eyed to a shaft 42 which derives its movement from an electric motor, not shown the shaft 42 transmits the movement, through pulleys 43, 44 and a belt 45, to a second shaft 46 whereto a wheel 47 is keyed. The wheel 47 carries an eccentric pin 48 which rotates in a slider 49 arranged in turn to slide along a lirO block 50 for converting the rotary motion into a ro tary oscillatory motion. The link block TO is keyed with its top end to a further shaft 51 which carries a free wheel mechanism 52, which engages with the shaft and rotates therewith in the direction of the arrow A, wherea in the revers direction it disengages and remains stationery. The fr e wheel 52 is rigid with the driving wheel 27.Thus, the rotation of the can 35 causes, during a half cycle, the anvil 5 to raise, the optimum welding pressure is supplied by adJustable load springs which may be accommodated either in the support of the vibrating assembly or between the support 40 and anvil 5 during this step there occurs no drive because the free wheel 52 is disengaged from the shaft 51.During the following half cycle, concurrently with the return of the anvil, the link block 50 reverses its oscillation and the pack of materials is advanced forward. The pin 48 is secured in a slot 53, and by shifting the tightening point, it becomes possible to adjust the amplitude of the link block oscillation, and therefore the travel distance thereof. The apparatusof the types discussed so far, which have a reciprocating type of motion, are also suitable for producing buttonholes and holes, either with insertion of the thermoplastic strip or in a direct manner with those materials which allow it . To this aim, it will be sufficient to adjust the advancement such as to obtain the desired interval, and to mount suitable tools. Figure 11 shows instead a continuous operation apparatus, of the so called rotary type. In the apparatus shovnnw the anvil comprises a cylindrical wheel 54 mounted on a shaft 55 underlying the bench 8. The shaft 55 is driven of continuous motion by an electric motor 56 equipped with a speed reducer 57. The flaps of the materials to be welded together are clamped between the cylindrical wheel 54 and the peripheral region of a vibrating tool 59 of tubular shape. The optimum welding pressure is supplied by an adjustable pressure spring accommodated in the support or holder of the vibrating assembly. The tool 59 is rotatable, through bearings 60, on a support 61 and is rotatively driven, for rotation about its own axis, by the advancing movement of tile materials which are entrained by the cylindrical wheel 54. With this operation mode, there occurs a slight rubbing action on the materials, as caused by the peripheral speed differential in a radial direction to the tool 59 and by a slightly curvilinear advance mente To avoid any rubbing or slipping effect, it is necessary to make the wheel 54 frusto conical and tilt the rotation axis of the shaft through an angle minus alpha or in the clockwise direction as shown inFigure 11 , such that the work surfaces are parallel, but accepting an advancement whose path exactly follows the arc of curvature of the tool. By tilting the axis of the shaft through an angle cx alpha, in the anticlockwise direction it is instead possible to achieve a rectilinear type of advanoement, at the expense, however, of an increased rubbing action or slide, As for the simultaneous cutting and weld steps it is expedient that the working surface of he tubular tool be configured as in Figure 9.In each embodiment of the apparatus described, the support or holder for the stripreel and the device for inserting said strip including said guide roller pair, and protective cover are readily taken apartto directly weld together suitable materials. The working surfaces of the anvils may be provided with embossed patterns to be reproduced on the welded area, as mentioned hereinabove. According to a further embodiment of this invention, it is possible to arrange the strip reel above the bench, e.g. by mounting it on the same arm which supports the vibrating assembly. A special configuration must be provided for the guide, in order to allow the strip to be inserted centrally.As is apparent from Figure 12, the guide 11 further comprises a side detent 62 for the lower flap 3, above which a slot or channel 63 is formed for the passage of the strip 1. The upper flap 2 follows instead a curvilinear path by means of which it is guided, from a vertical lay with respect to the flap 3, to a horizontal lay in overlapping relati onshi n with the flap 2 at the welding area or region. Thus, in actual practice, the flap 2 is subjected to a twisting action along a detent 64 which extends along a portion of an elongate spiral. It will be appreciated that this guide requires neither rollers nor a cover, and allows a frontal position of the operator. In Figure 13, there in illustrated a solution which, similarly to what is shown in Figure 6, proposes a guide for the flaps, wherein the sheets are all arranged on one and the same side. Similarly to Figure 8, Figure 14 shows a guide for forming a longitudinal tube or sleeve along one flap. The apparatus according to this invention can have a particularly compact and handy structure, which enables the production of a portable version, as illustrated in Figures 15 and 16. With such an apparatus, it becomes possible to carry out any operations such as welding by interposed thermoplastic strip or overlapped thermoplastic strip or direct welding. In Figures 15,16, the numeral 65 designates the transducer housing body, which has a handle 66 with an actuating trigger 67 and a connection device for the half wave resonator tool 68. The body 65 is formed with a shoulder 69 which acts as an abutment for a compression spring 70 interposed between it and a ring 71 guided on the body 65.To the ring 71, there is attached an arm 72 which extends on one side of the tool, and wherefrom there depends the guide 11 downwardly. The guide 11 has a supporting surface 73 and is carried in an interchangeable manner with other types of guides or anvils. A ring nut 74, serving as a detent for the ring 71 and threadable onto the body 65, allows the compression of the spring 70 to be adjusted. With the ring 71, there is rigid a bracket 75 for pivotally supporting the reel 76 carrying the thermoplastics strip, which reel will then take a frontal position. The guide 11, owing to the frontal position of the reel 76, is therefore of the type shown in Figure 12, and the flaps to be joined are again indicated at 2 and 3. The mode of operation of the apparatus is selfexplanatory. By resting the guide 11 on a flat, surface and manually presaing on the handle 66, the tool 68 is positioned on the pack of materials. At this point, by acting on the trigger 67, the timed emission control of the ultrasonic vibration is operated and the welding effected. The depth of penetration of the tool is adjusted through the fine thread stop screw 77 which abuts against the shoulder 69. After the first weld, the apparatus is moved to the right as viewed in Figure 16 , so that the guide 11 will turn the upper flap 2 onto the lower one, after the strip 1 has been introduced into the channel of the guide, thus producing a continuous weld. Upon completion of the weld, it is possible to cut the strip 1 by means of a knife edge 78 attached to the lower end of the arm 72.0f course, the guide 11 may have any desired shape directed to result in the formation of tubular edges Figure 17 or overlapping flaps on the same side Figure 18 . The illustrated portable apparatus may be mounted through the ring 88, rigid with the body 65, on a pillar type of support. The actuation may be normal or pneumatic, with either a control pushbutton or pedal. It should be noted, moreover, that this method allows the welding of nets of a thermoplastic material, which is usually difficult to carry out, especially on large mesh nets. The strip 1 functions, in fact, as a reinforcement to extend the area of contact between the nets, which would otherwise be limited to the crossing points in the mesh. It has been surprisingly found that in applying the method of this invention, and contrary to prior art experiences, DRAGON and acrylic resin fibrous materials in general could be advantageously welded by interposing a strip made of polypropylene or of a polyamidic resin known by its trademark SUPRONYL a registered trademark of Kalle ETiederlassung derHoechst AG, Postfach 3540 P 6200 Wiesbaden 1 and available in two types, N and W . As an example, two pieces of a DRAGON cloth for curtain use have been welded together in the manner previously described by overlying the two flaps with a small strip, 8 m high, of SUPRONYL registered trademark of the num 110 type i.e. 110 micron thick interposed therebetween, by the application of ultrasonic power as delivered by an electronic generator of approximately 1200 Watts, at a frequency of 20 KHz, to a vibrating assembly, namely a piezo electric ceramic sandwitch PST intermediate stagetool. The force exerted on the materials to be united, which were positioned between the tool and anvil, was of about 120 Kg. The welding time was about 0.5 seconds. The above for a weld length of approximately 50 mm. The strength of the resulting weld was such that a tension applied to the free flaps of theJoined material, in a transverse direction to the weld line, has resulted in the fabric yielding at an area remotely located from the welding area.It is also important to point out that the ultrasonic generators and transducers employed may be of any type and produce any suitable mode of vibration for welding thermoplastics materials. It is further possible to arrange for the utilization of sonic frequency generators and transducers.
