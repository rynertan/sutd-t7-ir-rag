# Method and apparatus for generating phase locked digital clock signals.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for generating two phase locked digital clocks of different word rates particularly suited for a graphic and alphanumeric computer display terminal. Master and slave clock generators are used to generate output pulses at every N th and M th clocks of a common clock. A phase lock loop including the master clock generator and a phase lock counter dividing the common clock by the factor of the least common multiple of N and M is used to synchronize the slave clock generator.
