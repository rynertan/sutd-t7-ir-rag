# Actuators.

## Abstract
An electric motor driven actuator comprises an electric motor 5 whose rotation causes rotation of a planet carrier 32 carrying planet gears 26,28 and 30 which engage an annulus gear 22 on the inside of a stationary ring 20. A pinion 34 transmits rotation of the planet carrier 32 to planet gears 52, 54 and 56 which are carried on a planet carrier 58 and engage an annulus inside a ring 36. Ring 36 can be moved axially by an armature 82 in dependence on energisation of an electro magnetic coil within a housing 70. When ring 36 moves towards ring 20, face teeth 42 which it carries engage face teeth 40, and ring 36 is thus held stationary. Its planet carrier 58 thus rotates and a coupling 60 rotates a shaft 110 which, via a tape 120, transmits drive to a cable 134. When the coil is de energised ring 36 moves away from ring 20 and is no longer held stationary and planet carrier 58 no longer rotates.
