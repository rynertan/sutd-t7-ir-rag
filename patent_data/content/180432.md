## Description
This invention relates to apparatus for reproducing digital signals recorded on a tape by a rotary head. Apparatus for recording and reproducing a digital signal is known, in which an analog signal such as an audio signal is converted to a digital signal a digital signal indicative of an address or a programme number together with the converted digital signal is recorded by a rotary head on a tape that is transported at a normal speed the digital signal thus recorded is reproduced from the tape transported at the normal speed the reproduced digital signal is converted to an analog signal such as an audio signal and the recorded address and programme number are confirmed. For example our European patent specification EP A 0 092 403 discloses such apparatus for recording and reproducing a digital signal. In a recording and reproducing apparatus, it is required that, even when the tape is transported at high speed a part of the digital signal such as an address signal and programme number recorded on the tape be reproduced by the rotary head to confirm the position of the information recorded on the tape and to control the operation. However, when the tape is transported at high speed, if the rotary head is rotated at normal speed, the relative speed between the tape and the head becomes different from that in the normal playback mode. Thus it becomes difficult to reproduce the digital signal recorded on the tape. European patent specification EP A2 0 075 948 discloses a disc or tape signal reproducing apparatus having two speed control loops for regulating the motor speed. When the speed has been brought within a given range by the first speed control loop using the maximum period between level transitions in the reproduced digital signals as speed reference, it is further controlled by the second speed control loop in dependence on a sync signal derived from the reproduced signal so as to maintain a constant speed. Japanese patent specification JP A 5906483 discloses a similar disc signal reproducing apparatus with an improved high rate search capability using a separate servo loop based on the difference between a predicted revolution number and the actual revolution number. German patent specification DE A1 3 233 147 discloses a magnetic tape reproducing apparatus in which during high speed search reproduction the horizontal scanning frequency of the reproduced video signal becomes the same as that during normal reproduction. According to the present invention there is provided apparatus for reproducing digital signals recorded on a recording tape, the apparatus comprising The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, throughout which like parts are referred to by like references, and in which In the embodiment of Figure 1 an analog signal, for example an audio signal applied to an input terminal 1, is supplied through a low pass filter LPF 2 to an analog to digital A D converter 3 in which it is converted from an analog signal to a digital signal. The digital output of the A D converter 3 is supplied through a contact In addition, although not shown, signals such as an address signal or a programme number signal are supplied to the recording signal generating circuit 5. In the recording signal generating circuit 5, signal processing such as the addition of an error correction code to the data, processing of the data in such a manner as to interleave it, and modulation are carried out in response to a timing signal from a timing signal generating circuit 7. The data signal is then supplied to a switching circuit 8. The switching circuit 8 is used to switch in rotary heads 11A and 11B at the proper times, and is alternately changed in position by the switching signal from the timing signal generating circuit 7 during a first half revolution interval including the tape contact period of the head 11A and during a second half revolution interval including the tape contact period of the head 11B. A pulse of 30 Hz in the case of a 30 frame per second television system indicative of the rotary phase of the rotary heads 11A and 11B is generated by a pulse generator not shown in Figure 1 but shown in Figure 9 as 51 and supplied to the timing signal generating circuit 7 in synchronism with the rotation of a motor for driving the rotary heads 11A and 11B. The signal from the switching circuit 8 which is changed in position by the switching signal from the timing signal generating circuit 7 is amplified by amplifiers 9A and 9B and then supplied through contacts R of switching circuits 10A and 10B to the rotary heads 11A and 11B, and thereby recorded on a magnetic tape 14 that is wound around and stretched between reels 12 and 13. The switching circuits 10A and 10B are connected to the contacts R upon recording and are connected to contacts P upon reproducing. Amplifiers 15A and 15B are respectively supplied with the reproduced outputs from the corresponding rotary heads 11A and 11B when the switching circuits 10A and 10B are changed in position to the contacts P upon playback. The outputs from the amplifiers 15A and 15B are both fed to a switching circuit 16. Similarly to the recording mode, the switching circuit 16 is alternated between its two positions by the switching signal of 30 Hz from the timing signal generating circuit 7 so that it is alternately in one position during the half rotation interval including the tape contact period of the head 11A and in the other position during the half rotation interval including the tape contact period of the head 11B. The output signal S6 switched by the switching circuit 16 is supplied through an equalizer 17, a comparator 18 and a phase locked loop PLL circuit 19 to an error detecting correcting circuit 20 in which the error thereof is detected and, it necessary, corrected. The resultant signal is supplied to a digital to analog D A converter 21 in which it is converted from a digital signal to an analog signal. This analog signal is then supplied through a low pass filter 22 to an output terminal 23 as an original analog output signal. It is also possible to derive the digital data directly from a terminal 24 provided at the output of the error detecting circuit 20. From the error detecting circuit 20, there are reproduced an address signal and a programme number. An edge detecting circuit 25 detects the leading edge and the trailing edge of the signal pulse produced at the output of the comparator 18, that is the reproduced digital signal. On the basis of the signal detected by the edge detecting circuit 25, a triangular wave generating circuit 26 generates a triangular wave. The peak of this triangular wave is detected by a peak hold circuit 27 and then fed to a sample and hold S H circuit 28. An envelope detecting circuit 29 is provided at the output of the switching circuit 16, and, on the basis of the output of the envelope detecting circuit 29, a mask signal generating circuit 30 generates a mask signal for masking a period in which no data is obtained, such as when the rotary heads 11A and 11B do not trace the tape 14 as will be described later . The mask signal S8 produced by the mask signal generating circuit 30 is supplied to a pulse generating circuit 31. The pulse generating circuit 31 sequentially produces a sampling pulse PS and a reset pulse PR during the period t2 Figure 5C of the mask signal S8. The reset pulse PR is supplied to the peak hold circuit 27 and the sampling pulse PS is supplied to the S H circuit 28. Thus the output S4 from the peak hold circuit 27 is sampled by the sampling pulse PS in the S H circuit 28. Thereafter, the peak hold circuit 27 is reset by the reset pulse PR from the pulse generating circuit 31 and the peak hold circuit 27 is set in the mode to hold the peak value of the next output S3 from the triangular wave generating circuit 26. The signal S5 sampled and held by the S H circuit 28 is fed to a drum servo circuit 32 as relative speed information. The drum servo circuit 32 controls via a switching circuit 33 a motor 34 which rotates the drum not shown to which the rotary heads 11A and 11B are attached. A frequency divider 35 divides the frequency of the reproduced clock signal S12 generated from the reproduced digital data in the PLL circuit 19 by a predetermined ratio. The output S13 from the frequency divider 35 is supplied through a switch 36 first switching means to a frequency to voltage F V converting circuit 37 in which it is converted from a frequency signal to a voltage signal S14. The switch 36 is controlled by an error check output signal S10 Figures 1A and 6B produced by the error detecting circuit 20. When an error occurs, the error check output signal assumes, for example, a high level, and the switch 36 is turned on. The voltage signal S14 from the converting circuit 37 is supplied to one input terminal of a comparator 38, in which it is compared with a reference voltage supplied to the other input terminal thereof from a reference voltage generating circuit 39. A compared error signal from the comparator 38 is supplied to a drum servo circuit 40 as the relative speed information and the motor 34 is selectively controlled by this drum servo circuit 40 via the switch circuit 33. The apparatus thus includes two drum servo systems one of which is the servo system including the drum servo circuit 32 and components associated therewith and the other of which is the servo system including the drum servo circuit 40 and components associated therewith. The two drum servo systems are properly switched in response to the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B on the one hand and the tape 14 on the other, as described below. A second switching means 41 Figure 1A is provided to change over the switching circuit 33 provided at the outputs of the drum servo circuits 32 and 40. The switching means 41 is operated in such a manner that, when the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 deviates significantly from a set value or the reproduced data and the reproduced clock are not synchronized with each other, the switching means 41 produces an output signal of low level by which the switching circuit 33 is switched to its contact By way of example, the switching means 41 is formed of a counter 42, a NAND circuit 43, an inverter 44 and a D type flip flop circuit 45. The signal switching pulse that is supplied to the switching circuit 16 by the timing signal generating circuit 7 is supplied also to a reset terminal R of the counter 42 and to a clock terminal CK of the flip flop circuit 45. In synchronism with, for example, the trailing edge of this switching pulse, the counter 42 is reset and the flip flop circuit 45 latches the input data. The outputs from output terminals QA and QB of the counter 42 are respectively supplied to the input terminals of the NAND circuit 43. The output from the NAND circuit 43 is supplied to an enable terminal E of the counter 42 and, through the inverter 44, to an input terminal D of the flip flop circuit 45. When the signal supplied to the enable terminal E of the counter 42 is high, the counter 42 carries out the count operation and when this signal is low, the counter 42 stops counting. The output from an output terminal Q of the flip flop circuit 45 is supplied to the switching circuit 33 to control the state thereof. Figures 2 to B show the operation of the circuit shown in Figure 1. When the reproducing apparatus is in the fast forward mode, the loci of the rotary heads 11A and 11B become as shown by broken lines A and B in Figure 2. When the reproducing apparatus is in the rewind mode, the loci of the rotary heads 11A and 11B become as shown by solid lines A and B in Figure 2. The general direction of movement of the rotary heads 11A and 11B relative to the tape 14 is indicated by an arrow H, and the direction of movement of the tape 14 is indicated by an arrow T in Figure 2. Since the heads 11A and 11B produce outputs from tracks whose azimuths are coincident with those of the heads 11A and 11B but produce substantially no outputs from tracks whose azimuths are not coincident with those of the heads 11A and 11B, the heads 11A and 11B generate reproduced signals whose waveforms are a so called bead shape as shown in Figure 3. When the reproduced signal is passed through the equalizer 17 and the comparator 18, the comparator 18 generates a reproduced digital signal S1 of a square waveform as shown in Figure 4A. The period and thus the frequency of this square waveform signal S1 changes in accordance with the magnitude of the relative speed between the heads 11A, 11B and the tape 14. Accordingly, since, as described later, the relative speed corresponding to the signal S1 from the comparator 18 is detected and servo control is applied to the drum motor 34 through the drum servo circuit 32 in accordance with the magnitude of the relative speed, the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 can be controlled to be made constant, notwithstanding changes in the speed of the tape 14. When the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 deviates significantly from the predetermined value, the deviation is detected and the detected deviation is minimized by the servo system including the drum servo circuit 32. As Figure 4A shows, the reproduced digital output signal S1 from the comparator 18 is formed of four periods or intervals T, 2T, 3T and 4T, where T is taken as a fundamental period. The reproducing apparatus employs a modulation system in which the minimum transition interval Tmin is T and the maximum transition interval Tmax is 4T. The leading edge and the trailing edge of the output signal S1 from the comparator 18 are detected by the edge detecting circuit 25, which produces therefrom a signal S2 of narrow width as shown in Figure 4B. The detected signal S2 is supplied to the triangular wave signal generating circuit 26, in which a triangular wave signal S3 is formed. The signal S3 gradually rises from the occurrence point of the signal S2, as shown in Figure 4C. The triangular wave signal S3 is supplied to the peak hold circuit 27, which holds the peak value of the signal S3 and produces a signal S4 shown in Figure 4F. The signal S4 from the peak hold circuit 27 is supplied to the S H circuit 28 in which the signal S4 is sampled by a sampling pulse PS Figure 4E from the pulse generating circuit 31. The sampled value is held by the circuit 28. As a result, the S H circuit 28 produces at its output a signal S5 shown in Figure 4G. The operating cycle of the S H circuit 28 is set to a predetermined length of time, for example a length of time sufficient to ensure that at least one maximum transition interval of duration 4T out of the output of the comparator 18 is included in each sample interval. The peak hold circuit 27 is periodically reset by the reset pulse PR Figure 4D produced by the pulse generating circuit 31. Accordingly, the output signal S4 of the peak hold circuit 27 changes as shown in Figure 4F. The level of the voltage sampled and held in the S H circuit 28 or the signal S5 substantially corresponds to the time width 4T Tmax in Figure 4A. Accordingly, if the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 becomes too low and the output frequency becomes correspondingly low, the time width 4T Tmax increases and the sampled and held voltage increases correspondingly. On the contrary, if the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 becomes too high and the output frequency becomes correspondingly high, the time width 4T Tmax diminishes and the sampled and held voltage diminishes correspondingly. Thus the sampled and held voltage corresponds directly to the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14, and the sampled and held voltage or the signal S5 can be regarded as the relative speed information. The relative speed information thus obtained has the signal waveform shown in Figure 4G. Since the signal S5 produced at the output of the sample and hold circuit 28 is supplied to the drum servo circuit 32 as the relative speed information and feedback is applied to the drum motor 34 from the drum servo circuit 32, the relative speed between the tape and the rotary heads 11A and 11B can be maintained constant, notwithstanding variations in the speed of the tape 14. In view of the servo control described above, the motor not shown for driving the reels 12 and 13 need not be controlled with a servo but may be driven simply by a constant voltage. In the fast forward or rewind mode, the output of bead shaped waveform Figure 3 is produced by the heads 11A and 11B, but a head 11A or 11B whose azimuth is not coincident with that of a track being scanned at a particular time produces no output, so that at that time, the comparator 18 cannot produce at its output the square waveform signal S1. Accordingly, at such time, it is necessary to prevent the sampling pulse PS Figure 4E and the reset pulse PR Figure 4D from being produced. To this end, an output S6 produced at the output of the switching circuit 16 and shown in Figure 5A is supplied to the envelope detecting circuit 29, which generates therefrom a signal S7 shown in Figure 5B. The output signal S7 from the envelope detecting circuit 29 is supplied to the mask signal generating circuit 30 in which the envelope detected output S7 is reshaped with a threshold level Th as a reference. The mask signal generating circuit 30 thus produces a mask signal S8 shown in Figure 5C. During a period t1 of the mask signal S8, when the level of the signal S7 is below the threshold level Th, the sampling pulse PS and the reset pulse PR produced by the pulse generating circuit 31 are masked. The sampling pulse PS and the reset pulse PR are produced only during the period t2 of the mask signal S8, when the level of the signal S7 exceeds the threshold level Th. In other words, the sampling pulse PS and the reset pulse PR, by which the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 is detected, are produced only during a period in which a substantial RF output is produced by the heads 11A and 11B, or only during a period in which the square wave output S1 corresponding to T to 4T is produced by the comparator 18. Thus it becomes possible to carry out the relative speed detection and control with high accuracy. The servo system described above includes the drum servo circuit 32 and associated circuitry and employs the 4T Tmax pattern and is operative when the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 deviates considerably from the predetermined value. A servo system including the drum servo 40 and associated circuitry and using the reproduced clock is operative when the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 comes closer to the predetermined value. In the fast forward mode or the rewind mode, the switching circuit 16 produces at its output a signal S9 having the bead shaped RF waveform shown in Figure 6A. When the signal S9 is passed through the equalizer 17 and the comparator 18, the comparator 18 produces at its output a signal reproduced digital signal S11 of a square waveform shown in Figure 7A. The signal S11 is supplied to the PLL circuit 19 which produces, if the reproduced data is correct, a reproduced clock signal S12 synchronized with the reproduced data as shown in Figure 7B. Whether or not the reproduced data is correct can be determined by the error detecting circuit 20, which generates an error check output signal S10 shown in Figure 6B. More particularly, when the signal S10 is high, the reproduced data is correct. Thus when this signal S10 is high, the switch 36 is closed and the frequency divider 35 supplies to the frequency to voltage converter 37 a reproduced clock signal S13 which is shown in Figure 8A in an enlarged scale. The converting circuit 37 produces internally a sawtooth waveform signal rising with a constant slope in synchronism with the leading edge of the signal S13 and which is shown by a solid line in Figure 8B. The inclined portion of this sawtooth signal is sampled by the trailing edge of the signal S13 so that the converting circuit 37 produces at its output a signal S14 which is converted from the frequency output to the voltage signal. The waveform of the signal S14 is shown by a broken line in Figure 8B. The level of the signal S14 increases in proportion to the period reciprocal of the frequency of the signal S13. In other words, as the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 increases, the period of the signal S13 becomes shorter, so that the level of the signal S14 becomes lower. On the contrary, if the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 decreases, the period of the signal S13 becomes longer, so that the level of the signal S14 becomes higher. The voltage signal S14 from the converting circuit 37 is supplied to the comparator 38 in which it is compared with a reference voltage from the reference voltage generating circuit 39. Accordingly, the comparator 38 produces at its output a positive compared error signal when the level of the signal S14 is higher than that of the reference signal and a negative compared error signal when the level of the signal S14 is lower than that of the reference signal. The compared error signal produced by the comparator 38 is supplied to the drum servo circuit 40 as the relative speed information. The counter 42 is reset in synchronism with the trailing edge of the switching pulse from the timing signal generating circuit 7 and sequentially counts the error check output signal S10 from the error correcting circuit 20. More particularly, if the counter 42 counts a predetermined number of, for example, three signals S10 over one period of the switching pulse from the timing signal generating circuit 7 or during the tracing period of both of the heads 11A and 11B, this is confirmation that the correct data is being reproduced, and the counter 42 produces the output 11 at the output terminals QA and QB. As a result, at the output of the NAND circuit 43, there is produced a signal of low level which is fed back to the enable input E of the counter 42 and causes the count operation of the counter 42 to stop. The signal from the NAND circuit 43 is supplied also through the inverter 44 to an input terminal D of the flip flop circuit 45 in which it is latched at the trailing edge of the next switching pulse from the timing signal generating circuit 7. As a result, the flip flop circuit 45 produces at its output terminal Q a signal of high level by which the switching circuit 33 is changed in position to the contact Accordingly, the output from the drum servo circuit 40 is supplied through the switching circuit 33 to the motor 34. The drum servo circuit 40 causes the motor 34 to accelerate when the compared error signal from the comparator 38 is positive and to decelerate when the compared error signal is negative. In other words, the motor 34 is accelerated when the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 is lower than the predetermined value and decelerated when it is higher than the predetermined value. Thus, the relative speed between the rotary heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 can be maintained constant. As set forth above, when the reproduced data is not synchronized with the reproduced clock and deviates substantially from the predetermined value, the servo system including the drum servo circuit 32 and associated components is used to carry out the control, while when the reproduced data is synchronized with the reproduced clock and the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B comes closer to the predetermined value, the servo system including the drum servo circuit 40 and associated components is used to carry out the control. It thus becomes possible to control the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape with higher accuracy and precision. While in the embodiment described above the reproduced data can be regarded as correct if three error check output signals are produced by the error corrector 20 during a period in which both of the heads 11A and 11B trace the tape, the present invention is not limited to that case but applies also to a case wherein the reproduced data can be regarded as correct if the error check output signals of a desired number are produced over a period in which, for example, one of the heads 11A and 11B traces the tape 14. Figure 9 is a circuit block diagram showing another embodiment of the digital signal reproducing apparatus according to the present invention. In Figure 9, parts corresponding to those of Figure 1 are marked with the same references and will not be described in detail. In the embodiment of Figure 9, there are provided two drum servo systems of which one is formed of a drum servo circuit 59 and associated components and the other is formed of a drum servo circuit 40 and associated components. The circuit of Figure 9 is thus similar in this respect to the circuit of Figure 1. When the relative speed between the heads 11A and 11B and the tape 14 deviates considerably from the predetermined value, a period detecting circuit 52, a drum acceleration or deceleration judging means 53 and the drum servo circuit 59 become operative. A pulse generator 51 shown in Figure 9 generates a pulse indicative of the rotary phase of the rotary heads 11A and 11B and supplies the pulse to the timing signal generating circuit 7. A frequency generator 50 generates a pulse FG which is proportional to the rotary speed of the drum motor 34. The frequency of the pulse FG is 800 Hz when the rotary speed of the drum is, for example, 2000 rpm and 1600 Hz when the rotary speed of the drum is, for example, 4000 rpm. The pulse FG from the frequency generator 50 is supplied to a period frequency detecting circuit 52 which detects the rotary speed of the drum by counting the period frequency of the pulse FG by means of a suitable clock. The rotary speed information from the period detecting circuit 52 is supplied to the drum acceleration or deceleration judging means 53 which extracts the acceleration information or deceleration information. The drum acceleration or deceleration judging means 53 comprises a decoder 54 which decodes information concerning speed lower than a first speed, a decoder 55 which decodes information concerning speed having a value between the first speed and a second speed or between the second speed and a third speed, a decoder 56 which decodes information concerning speed higher than the third speed, and a discriminating circuit 57 which extracts the acceleration or deceleration information on the basis of the outputs from the decoders 54, 55 and 56. The discriminating circuit 57 is supplied from a terminal 58 with a mode switching signal for identifying the fast forward mode FF mode and the rewind REW mode. The output signal from the discriminating circuit 57 is supplied to a drum driving circuit not shown of the drum servo circuit 59 as the acceleration or deceleration information thereof. By means of the drum servo circuit 59, it is possible to control via the switch 33 the drum motor 34 that drives the drum not shown to which the heads 11A and 11B are attached. In this embodiment, there are two servo systems, namely the servo system including the drum servo circuit 59 and associated components and the drum servo system including the drum servo circuit 40 and associated components. The two servo systems are properly switched in accordance with the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 as described below. The switching means 41 controls the state of the switching circuit 33 which is provided at the outputs of the drum servo circuits 59 and 40, as in the case of Figure 1. When the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect of the tape 14 deviates substantially from the predetermined value or when the reproduced data is not synchronized with the reproduced clock, the switching means 41 produces, for example, a signal of low level to connect the movable arm of the switching circuit 33 to the contact Figure 10 illustrates the operation of the circuit shown in Figure 9. First, the case in which the relative speed deviates significantly from the predetermined value or the reproduced data and the reproduced clock are not synchronized with each other will be described. The relative speed VR of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape in the fast forward and rewind modes is calculated by the following equation wherein VD is the rotary speed of the drum, ϑ0 is the still angle between the head trace and the tape when the tape is stationary, n is the ratio of the tape speed in the fast forward or rewind mode to the tape speed in the normal playback mode, and VT is the tape speed in the formal playback mode. If, for example, VR 3.13349 mm s , ϑ0 6.36667 deg and VT 8.15 mm s , then the relation between the tape multiple speed value n and the rotary speed VD of the drum is as shown in the graph of Figure 10. As Figure 10 shows, the rotary speed of the drum is 3283.96 rpm when n 250 and 705.7 rpm when n 250. Accordingly, in order to lock in the relative speed to a given constant value in the fast forward mode, when n is less than or equal to 250, it is sufficient to establish the rotary speed of the drum within the range of from 2000 to 3284 rpm. In the rewind mode, when n is greater than or equal to 250, in order to lock in the relative speed to a given constant value, it is sufficient to establish the rotary speed of the drum within the range of from 705 to 2000 rpm. Therefore, in the period detecting circuit 52, the pulse FG from the frequency generator 50 is counted, and the rotary speed of the drum is detected. The drum rotary speed information is supplied to the decoders 54 to 56. In a practical case, the first speed to which the decoder 54 is responsive may be taken as 705 rpm, the second speed to which the decoder 55 is responsive as 2000 rpm, and the third speed to which the decoder 56 is responsive as 3284 rpm. Then, when the drum is rotated at a speed of 2000VD π greater than 3284 rpm in the fast forward mode , the output DO1 of the decoder 56 becomes 0 and the output DO2 of the decoder 55 becomes 0 when the drum is rotated at a speed of 2000VD π, where 3284 rpm is greater than or equal to 2000VD π is greater than 2000 rpm, the output DO1 becomes 1 and the output DO2 becomes 0 and when the drum is rotated at a speed of 2000 rpm greater than or equal to 2000VD π, the output DO1 becomes 1 and the output DO2 becomes 1 . In the rewind mode, when the drum is rotated at speed greater than 2000 rpm, the output DO2 becomes 0 and the output DO3 of the decoder 54 becomes 0 when the drum is rotated at speed of 2000 rpm is greater than or equal to 2000VD π is greater than 705 rpm, the output DO2 becomes 1 and the output DO3 becomes 0 and when the drum is rotated at speed of 705 rpm is greater than or equal to 2000VD π, the output DO2 becomes 1 and the output DO3 becomes 1 . These decoded results are supplied to the discriminating circuit 57. In response to the mode switching signal supplied to the discriminating circuit 57 from the terminal 58, the discriminating circuit 57 is operated so that in the fast forward mode, when the outputs DO1 and DO2 are both 0 , a deceleration is carried out when the output DO1 is 1 and the output DO2 is 0 , the relative speed is held constant and when outputs DO1 and DO2 are both 1 , an acceleration is carried out. In the rewind mode, when the outputs DO2 and DO3 are both 0 , a deceleration is carried out when the output DO2 is 1 and the output DO3 is 0 , the relative speed is held constant and when the outputs DO2 and DO3 are both 1 , an acceleration is carried out. On the basis of these decisions, the discriminating circuit 57 supplies the signal 1 to the drum servo circuit 59 in the case of acceleration and supplies the signal 0 to the drum servo circuit 59 in the case of deceleration. The drum servo circuit 59 accelerates or decelerates the drum motor 34 in response to these signals. In these operations, the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 arrives at a certain predetermined value without fail. At that time, the reproduced data is always synchronized with the reproduced clock. Accordingly, at that time, the switching means 41 produces the output signal of high level by which the movable arm of the switching circuit 33 is connected to the contact As described above, when the reproduced data is not synchronized with the reproduced clock and the relative speed deviates substantially from the predetermined value, the servo system including the drum servo circuit 59 and associated components is used to carry out the control, while when the reproduced data is synchronized with the reproduced clock and the relative speed comes sufficiently close to the predetermined value, the servo system including the drum servo circuit 40 and associated components is used to carry out the control. Thus, it becomes possible to carry out the control of the relative speed with very high accuracy and precision. Figure 11 is a circuit block diagram showing an example of the period detecting circuit 52 and the drum acceleration or deceleration judging means 53. In Figure 11, the pulse FG from the frequency generator 50 Figure 9 is supplied to an input terminal 60. The pulse FG from the input terminal 60 is supplied to an edge detecting circuit 61 which detects the edge, for example the leading edge, of the pulse FG. The pulse signal from the edge detecting circuit 61 is supplied to clear terminals CL of counters 62 and 63 which are connected in cascade. The edge detecting circuit 61 and the counters 62 and 63 constitute the period detecting circuit 52 Figure 9 . Clock terminals of the counters 62 and 63 are respectively supplied with a clock signal having a predetermined frequency, for example, 10 kHz, from a terminal 64. The counter 62 comprises output terminals QA, QB, QC and QD having weightings 1, 2, 4 and 8, respectively, and the counter 63 comprises output terminals QA, QB, QC and QD having weightings 16, 32, 64 and 128, respectively. A carry terminal CA of the counter 62 is connected to an input terminal IN of the counter 63. The output terminal QC of the counter 62 is connected to one input terminal of a NAND circuit 65 that corresponds to the decoder 54 Figure 9 and to one input terminal of a NAND circuit 66 that corresponds to the decoder 55 Figure 9 . The output terminal QD of the counter 62 is connected to the other input terminal of the NAND circuit 66 and to the input terminal of an inverter 67 corresponding to the decoder 56 Figure 9 . The output terminal QB of the counter 63 is connected to the other input terminal of the NAND circuit 65. The NAND circuit 65, corresponding to the decoder 54, which decodes the drum rotary speed information lower than 705 rpm, opens its gate when the counters 62 and 63 count about 36 clock pulses supplied thereto from the terminal 64 during one period of the pulse FG. The NAND circuit 66, corresponding to the decoder 55, which decodes the rotary drum speed information lower than 2000 rpm, opens its gate when the counter 62 counts about 12 clock pulses supplied therto during one period of the pulse FG. The inverter 67, corresponding to the decoder 56, which decodes the drum rotary speed information lower than 3284 rpm, produces an inverted output when the counter 62 counts about 8 clock pulses supplied thereto from the terminal 64 during one period of the pulse FG. The outputs of the NAND circuits 65, 66 and of the inverter 67 are respectively connected to set terminals S of R S flip flop circuits 68, 69 and 70. Output terminals Q of the flip flop circuits 68, 69 and 70 are respectively connected to input terminals D of D type flip flop circuits 71, 72 and 73. The output of the edge detecting circuit 61 is connected also to reset terminals R of the flip flop circuits 68 to 70 and through an inverter 74 to the clock terminals of the flip flop circuits 71 to 73. The output DO3 of the flip flop circuit 71 is connected through an inverter 75 to a set terminal S of an R S flip flop circuit 76. The output DO2 of the flip flop circuit 72 is connected to a reset terminal R of the flip flop circuit 76 and through an inverter 77 to a set terminal S of an R S flip flop circuit 78. The output DO1 of the flip flop circuit 73 is connected to a reset terminal R of the flip flop circuit 78. The outputs of the flip flop circuits 76 and 78 are respectively connected to first input terminals of AND circuits 79 and 80. The second input terminal of the AND circuit 79 is connected via an inverter 82 to a terminal 81 to which the mode switching signal is applied. The second input terminal of the AND circuit 80 is connected directly to the terminal 81. The output terminals of the AND circuits 79 and 80 are respectively connected to input terminals of an OR circuit 83, which produces an output signal on an output terminal 84. The output terminal 85 is connected to the input terminal of the drum servo circuit 59 Figure 9 . The circuit elements 68 to 83 form the discriminating circuit 57 Figure 9 . The signal waveforms of Figures 12A to 12E illustrate the operation of the circuit shown in Figure 11. When a pulse FG, whose waveform is shown in Figure 12A, is supplied from the terminal 60 to the edge detecting circuit 61, the leading edge thereof is detected thereby and the edge detecting circuit 61 produces at its output a pulse signal whose waveform is shown in Figure 12B. When this pulse signal is supplied to the clear terminals CL of the counters 62 and 63, the counters 62 and 63 are cleared. The counters 62 and 63 then begin to count the clock pulses applied thereto from the terminal 64. As a result, the counters 62 and 63 produce the count values corresponding to the length of one period of the pulse FG. That is, the rotary speed of the drum at a desired time can be detected. If the rotary speed of the drum is lower than 705 rpm, the NAND circuit 65 produces at its output the signal 0 if it is lower than 2000 rpm, the NAND circuit 66 produces at its output the signal 0 and if it is lower than 3284 rpm, the inverter 67 produces at its output the signal 0 Figure 12C . When the outputs of the NAND circuits 65, 66 and the inverter 67 become 0 , each of the flip flop circuits 68 to 70 produces at its output the signal 1 Figure 12D . When the pulse signal from the edge detecting circuit 61 is inverted by the inverter 74 and then fed to the clock terminals of the flip flop circuits 71 to 73, the signal 1 is latched in the flip flop circuits 71 to 73 so that the outputs of the flip flop circuits 71 to 73 become 1 Figure 12E . The truth tables of the R S flip flop circuits 68 to 70 are shown in the following table 1. The outputs DO3 to DO1 of the flip flop circuits 71 to 73 become as follows in accordance with the rotary speed of the rotary drum and the respective modes the fast forward mode and the rewind mode In the fast forward mode, if the rotary speed of the rotary drum exceeds 3284 rpm, the output DO1 of the flip flop circuit 73 and output DO2 of the flip flop circuit 72 both become 1 if the rotary speed of the rotary drum is within the range of from 2000 to 3284 rpm, the output DO1 becomes 0 and the output DO2 becomes 1 and if the rotary speed of the rotary drum is less than 2000 rpm, the outputs DO1 and DO2 both become 0 . On the other hand, in the rewind mode, if the rotary speed of the rotary drum exceeds 2000 rpm, the output DO2 of the flip flop circuit 72 and the output DO3 of the flip flop circuit 71 both become 1 if the rotary speed of the rotary drum is within the range of from 705 to 2000 rpm, the output DO2 becomes 0 and the output DO3 becomes 1 and if the rotary speed of the rotary drum is less than 705 rpm, the outputs DO2 and DO3 both become 0 . These relationships are classified in the following table 2. The output DO3 from the flip flop circuit 71 is supplied through the inverter 75 to the set terminals of the flip flop circuit 76, and the output DO2 from the flip flop circuit 72 is supplied to the reset terminal R of the flip flop circuit 76 and through the inverter 77 to the set terminal S of the flip flop circuit 78. The output DO1 from the flip flop circuit 73 is supplied to the reset terminal R of the flip flop circuit 78. The flip flop circuits 76 and 78 are operated in accordance with the truth table of table 1. In this case, however, the flip flop circuits 76 and 78 have no operation such that the set terminals S and the reset terminals R thereof are both 0 and the output terminals Q thereof are 0 . In the fast forward mode, a signal of high level 1 is supplied to the terminal 81, while in the rewind mode, a signal of low level 0 is supplied thereto. Accordingly, in the fast forward mode, the gate of the AND circuit 80 is opened to allow the output from the flip flop circuit 78 to be supplied through the OR circuit 83 to the output terminal 84. In other words, the acceleration information is produced at the output terminal 84 when the output at the output terminal Q of the flip flop circuit 78 is 1 , while the deceleration information is produced at the output terminal 84 when the output at the output terminal Q of the flip flop circuit 78 is 0 . When the output is not changed, the preceding state of the drum is maintained. In the rewind mode, the AND circuit 79 opens its gate to allow the output at the output terminal Q of the flip flop circuit 76 to be supplied through the OR circuit 83 to the output terminal 84. Thus the acceleration information is produced at the output terminal 84 when the output at the output terminal Q of the flip flop circuit 76 is 1 , while the deceleration information is produced thereat when the output at the output terminal Q of the flip flop circuit 76 is 0 . When the output is not changed, the preceding state of the drum is maintained. As set forth above, in the embodiment of Figure 9, the period frequency of the pulse FG proportional to the rotary speed of the rotary drum is measured the range of the rotary speed of the rotary drum is then determined on the basis of this measured period thereby to determine the acceleration or deceleration this acceleration or deceleration information is supplied to the drum driving circuit thereby to change the rotary speed of the rotary drum within a predetermined range so that the relative speed of the heads 11A and 11B with respect to the tape 14 arrives at the predetermined value and servo control of the drum by means of the reproduced clock can then be established. Therefore, it is possible to control the relative speed between the tape and the head to be always constant without any problems due to drop out and the like, and notwithstanding changes in the speed of the tape. Many modifications of the embodiments described above will readily occur to those skilled in the art. For example, the values of 705, 2000 and 3284 rpm, the specific circuitry employed to implement the various functions described above, and the waveforms in the drawings can be modified in accordance with the operating characteristics of different systems.
