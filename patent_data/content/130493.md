# DOOR LATCH MECHANISM

## Abstract
A door latch mechanism has a pivoted latch disposed be tween a retaining solenoid and a four bar toggle linkage. The toggle linkage connects the operating stem of the solenoid to the latch, has an under the center arrangement in a direction away from the solenoid in the latched position of the mecha nism, and provides a substantial mechanical advantage to am plify the holding force of the solenoid. When the solenoid is de energized and pressure is applied to open the door, the latch pivots and the toggle linkage collapses to release the keeper bar. The keeper bar is trapped but has a limited movement in both horizontal and vertical directions in a plane substantially parallel to the pivot axis of the latch. the overall arrangement is relatively simple, compact, inexpensive, easy to install, and re liable in its operation.
