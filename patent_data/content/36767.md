# Magnetic recording method.

## Abstract
A magnetic recording method for recording a multiplex al comprising two different frequency signals. There is a magnetic recording medium having a magnetic layer the thichness smaller than recorded wavelength of of said two signals. The signal of higher frequency is rded at a current larger by more than 2 dB than the er limit of the recording current with which a reproduced ut level is saturated, and smaller than a current with ch the reproduced output level is reduced by 1 dB nd said saturated condition. And the signal of lower uency is recorded at a current smaller than a half as as that of the signal of higher frequency.
