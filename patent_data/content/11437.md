# A process for setting a product comprising electrostatically spun fibres, and products prepared according to this process.

## Abstract
A process for setting in a desired shape a product 1 at least a portion of which comprises electrostatically spun fibres is disclosed. The process comprises maintaining the product in the desired shape at a temperature below the melding temperature of the electrostatically spun fibres. The desired shape may be the as spun shape of the product or a shape obtained by deformation of the product, i.e. the pro duct is reshaped. The fibres preferably comprise a polyurethane and reshaping is preferably effected on a former 2,3 . The reshaped product may be employed as a vascular prosthesis.
