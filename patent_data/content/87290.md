# Tape recorder.

## Abstract
A magnetic head is fixedly mounted on the cassette holder in a cassette tape recorder. When a taper cassette is inserted into the cassette holder, a magnetic tape is brought into contact with the front face of the magnetic head through an access opening in the tape cassette. In response to selection of stop, fast forward, and rewind modes of operation, a pad shifter disposed on the cassette holder adjacent to the magnetic head is moved to displace a pad in the tape cassette out of pressed contact with the magnetic tape. When in a recording or playback mode of operation, the pad shifter is retracted to allow the pad to resiliently press the magnetic tape against the magnetic head. The tape recorder is rendered small in size particularly in the transverse direction of the tape cassette inserted.
