## Description
A REEL SEAT FOR A FISHING ROD This invention relates to a reel seat for use in mounting a fishing reel on a fishing rod with the leg of the fishing reel held along the rod, said reel seat comprising a a seat body for mounting longitudinally along the fishing rod said seat body having on its upper face at one end a plurality of grooves each of which extends laterally of the seat body and which are arranged longitudinally along the seat body, b a stationary socket fixed at one end of said seat body for receiving one end of the reel leg, c a movable socket which is positioned at the other end of said seat body and opposite to said stationary socket for receiving the other end of the reel leg, said movable socket being supported on said seat body so as to be slidable lengthwise thereof, d a leaf spring having an engagement portion for engagement with a said groove on said seat body and a control member mounted for movement of said leaf spring into and out of engagement with the grooves. Generally this kind of reel seat holds the reel leg in such a manner that the reel leg is inserted at its one end into the stationary socket and sleeved at the other end by the slidably movable socket and the control member is operated to bias toward the seat body a retaining leaf spring supported to the movable holder so that the leaf spring is fitted at its bent end into a recess at the seat bo.dy, thereby retaining the movable socket to the seat body, thus holding the reel leg between both the holders. When fixing the reel leg by operating the control segment as aforeg9ing, the movable socket tends to move apart from the stationary socket. Even if this does not occur, the leaf spring is often engaged with the incorrect groove so that the movable socket tends to move away from the stationary socket. As a result, the reel leg, even when it is supposedly fixed between the two sockets, is still relatively unsteady, This makes it difficult to correctly operate the fishing reel during the delicate operations involved in fishing. This invention is intended to overcome the above problems and it is an object of the invention to provide a reel seat capable of ensuring steady fixing of the reel leg between both the stationary and movable sockets. The present invention provides a retainer slidably mounted on the seat body separately from the movable socket, said control member and said leaf spring being mounted on said retainer for securing it on the seat body in a predetermined position when said leaf spring is engaged with a said groove, connection means being provide between the control member on the retainer and the movable socket for longitudinal movement of the movable socket towards the stationary socket when the control member is operated to secure the retainer in position on the seat body. An advantage provided by the present invention is that when the control member is operated to engage the leaf spring with one of the grooves on the seat body and securely position the retainer on the seat body, the movable socket is forcibly pushed towards the stationary socket by means of the connection means so that the reel leg is firmly gripped between the two sockets. In other words, the invention is directed to provide the retainer at the reel seat having the station ary socket and movable socket, the retainer being separate therefrom and having the retaining leaf spring and control member for the purpose of fixing the movable socket in position at the reel seat. A connection means conveniently in the form of an inter connecting member is inserted between the movable socket and the control member at the retainer, whereby when the control member is operated to hold the retainer, the swinging motion of control member is used to forcibly push the movable socket toward the stationary socket to thereby fix the reel leg steadily between both the holders. These and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent from the following description of some preferred specific embodiments thereof illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numbers are used to denote like parts in the various embodiments and in which Figure 1 is a plan view of a first embodiment of the invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the principal portion thereof Figure 3 is a sectional view of the principal portion shown in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a sectional view of the principal portion, in which the control segment is operated from the condition in Figure 3 Figures 5 and 6 are sectional views of two modified embodiments, corresponding to the view of Figure 3 Figure 7 is a plan view of the modified embodiment ofFigure 6 Figure 8 is a perspective view of a fourth, modified, embodiment Figure 9 is a partial sectional view of the embodiment shown in Figure 8 Figure 10 is a plan view of a fifth, modified, embodiment Figure 11 is a sectional view of the principal portion of the embodiment shown in Figure 10 and Figure 12 is a sectional view of the principal portion, showing the control segment operated from the condition shown in Figure 11. The drawings show a seat body for mounting on a fishing rod not shown . At an intermediate portion across the width of the seat body 1 is provided a recess 11 extending longitudinally of the body. At one lengthwise side of the recess 11 are provided a number of grooves 12 which extend in a direction across the width of the recess 11 and are arranged in a direction along the length thereof. The seat body 1 is formed of a pressed metallic plate having a section corresponding generally to an inverted U shape or possible an M shape . At both lengthwise ends of the seat body 1 are provided tongues 13 and 14 by means of which a reel seat may be mounted on the fishing rod.The tongues 13 and 14 abut against the outer periphery of the fishing rod in use of the seat body and may be fixed to the rod by conventional fixing means, such as stiff string and adhesives. When the reel seat is fixed onto the rod, both of the lengthwise side edges of the inverted generally U shaped body 1 are spaced from the rod. Such sonstractions of reel seats are already well known and widely used, and will accordingly be well understood to those skilled in the art without further detailed description. A stationary socket 2 is fixed at one lengthwise enc of the seat body 1. The stationary socket 2 holds one lengthwise end of a reel leg A see Figure 3 extending lengthwise of the fishing rod not shown , and is formed of a pressed metallic plate to be caulked at the side edges of the inverted U shape of the body seat. A movable socket 3, is supported at the other lengthwise end of the seat body 1 so as to be slidable lengthwise thereon and opposite the stationary socket 2. The movable socket 3 is formed of a pressed metallic plate and bent at both side edges to abut against both the side edges of the inverted U shaped seat body 1 and extend around the bottom side edges of the seat body 1 with int lrned edges so as to be slidable along the seat body 1. A retainer 4 separate from the movable socket 3 serves to retain the movable socket 3 in position on the seat body 1, is formed of a pressed metallic plate, and overlies the seat body 1 so as to be slidable thereon. As best seen from Figure 2, the retainer 4 has at both widthwise sides a pair of raised portions 41. The raised portions 41 are open at their inward opposed faces so that a control member 5 may be pivotally mounted for pivoting at the open ends. At a lengthwise intermediate portion of the retainer 4 is provided a recess 42. The recess 42 is provided at both longitudinal relative to the seat body ends with slots 43 and 44 through which a leaf spring 6 extends for mounting therebetween. The leaf spring 6 has at a substantially intermediate along its length portion a pair of wings 61 extending laterally outwards, the wings 61 being fitted into the recess 42. The portions of the leaf spring 6 just before and just behind the wings 61 are disposed through the slots 43 and 44 and an engagement or tail portion 62 which extends beyond the slot 44, i.e. in a direction away from the fixed socket 2, in use of the reel seat, is bent down towards the seat body 1, the bent tail portion 62 being engaged with one of the grooves 12 see Figure 4 .The control member 5, which holds the leaf spring 6 engaged with one of the grooves 12 is pivotally mounted in the raised portions 41 by means of a pair of ears 50 respectively, and an end of the pivoting control member 5 corresponding to the tail portion 62 of the leaf spring 6 is bent into a generallyL shaped form to thereby form a contact end 51.The control member 5 is turned in the direction of closing counterclockwise in the drawings to force the contact end 51 against the leaf spring 6 and in turn press the leaf spring 6 so that it is elastically deformed to resiliently engage at its bent tail portion 62 with one of the grooves 12, thus fixing the retainer 4 in a given position A connection means in the form of an interconnecting member 7 inserted between the movable socket 3 and the control member 5 is pivotally mounted on the retainer 4. The interconnecting member 7 converts the pivoting motion of the control member 5 in the closing direction thereof into a rectilinear motion to thereby push the movable socket 3 and forcibly move it towards the stationary socket 2. In detail the interconnecting member 7 shown in Figures 1 to 4 is formed of a wire rod bent into a generally U shape form.The tips of the legs of the interconnecting member 7 are connected non rotatably to a pair of supports 33 projecting from the movable socket 3 and the apex of the U shape is contacted with the contact end 51 of the control member 5.Hence, the displacement of the contact end 51 toward the stationary socket 2 when the control member 5 pivots in its closing direction, is utilized to allow the interconnecting member 7 to travel in rectilinear fashion towards the stationary socket 2, so that the movable socket 3 is urged towards it due to the fixed point of the engagement between the bent tail portion 62 of the leaf spring 6 with one of the grooves 12. In addition, as may be seen from Figures 3 and 4, the retainer 4 is provided at one end at the left side in the drawings with an extension 45 extending towards the movable socket 3. The extension 45 is connected at its free end with the movable socket 3 through a slot 32 therein so that the movable socket 3 may follow the retainer s longitudinal movement.Such a construction facilitates removal of the reel leg A from the reel seat. The application and operation of the above described reel seat will now be detailed. Firstly, when a fishing reel is mounted on the reel seat, the reel leg A thereof is inserted with one of its ends into the stationary socket 2 the movable socket 3 together with the retainer 4 is slidably moved towards the stationary socket 2 along the seat body 1 so as to fit onto the other end of reel leg A the control member being in its open position at this stage the control member 5 is then pivoted towards its closed position counterclockwise in the drawings , thereby allowing the contact end 51 of the control member 5 to contact with the leaf spring 6 and push it towards the seat body 1 the leaf spring 6 is engaged at its bent tail portion 62 with one of the grooves 12 on the seat body 1 and the retainer 4 is held in position thereby.In this instance, the interconnecting member 7 abuts against the contact end 51 of the control member 5 and is pushed towards the stationary socket 2 following the pivoting motion of the control member 5 in its closing direction, whereby the movable socket 3 firmly grips the other end of the reel leg A, thus ensuring a firm fixing of the reel leg A between the two sockets 2, 3. In addition, the invention is not limited to the above described construction, but may be improved and or modified with changes in design, for example as follows 1 The interconnecting member 7, which is inserted between the movable socket 3 and the control member 5 at the retainer 4, is pivoted at one end on the control member 5 and contacts at the other end with the movable socket 3.2 The interconnecting member 7 is pivoted at both ends thereof on the movable socket 3 and control member 5 respectively.3 The interconnecting member 7 is constituted by a torsion springas shown in Figure 5 and is pivoted on the movable socket 3 and control segment 5 respectively.4 The movable socket 3 is formed in a block of synthetic resin or plastics material and a hood 46 is provided on the retainer 4 in order to cover the movable socket 3 so that the movable socket 3 may slide longitudinally along the seat body 1 within the hood 46 see Figures 6 and 7 .5 The retainer 4 is positioned on the side of the stationary socket 2 remote from the movable socket 3, i.e. with the stationary socket 2 inbetween the movable socket 3 and the retainer 4 as shown in Figures 8 and 9 and the interconnecting member 7 extending between the retainer 4 and the movable socket 3 being necessarily made longer and pivoted on the movable socket 3 and the control member 5 at the retainer 4 respectively.6 The leaf spring 6 supported on the retainer 4 as shown in Figures 10 to 12, is bent upwardly as shown In Figure 11. The leaf spring 6 has a connection portion 63 which provides the connection means for connecting the movable socket 3 and retainer 4. In this particularly advantageous embodiment no separate interconnecting member is required, thereby simplifying the construction of reel seat. In addition, the leaf spring 6 is connected with the movable socket 3 in such a manner that a slot 33, which is provided in the movable socket 3 and extends widthwise thereof, is engaged with the connection portion in the form of an upwardly bent end 63 of the leaf spring 6. In this connection, the bent end 63 of the leaf spring 6 may merely contact the rear endof movable socket 3, or the end of leaf spring6 may be fixed, e.g. by soldering. In the above construction shown in Figures 10 to 12, when the control member 5 is operated in its closing direction counteS clockwise in the drawings from the condition in Figure 11 to that in Figure 12, the leaf spring 6 is deformed flat as shown in Figure 12 and its bent tail portion 62 is held engaged with one of the grooves 12. As a result, the leaf spring 6 becomes longitudinally extended compared with its free condition as shown in Figure 11, whereby the movable socket 3 is pushed towards the stationary socket 2 to reliably grip the reel leg A in the same way as in the former embodiments.7 The seat body 1 is formed as a pipe instead of in the form of a channel with an inverted generallyU shaped section. As will be clearly understood from the above description, the reel seat of the invention is provided with a retainer separate from the movable socket, the retainer holding the movable socket in a predetermined position lengthwise of the seat body, and having a control member and a leaf spring. The pivoting motion of the control member is converted into a rectilinear motion which is transmitted to the movable socket optionally with the aid of an interconnecting member, so that the movable socket is pushed towards the stationary socket thanks to the retainer secured to the seat body by the leaf spring engaged therewith. Hence, the fishing reel leg can be reliably and stably fixed between the stationary and movable sockets.
