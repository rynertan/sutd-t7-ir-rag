# Fiber reinforced rubber composition and production process thereof and fiber reinforced elastic product.

## Abstract
A fiber reinforced rubber composition capable of provid ing a vulcanizate having an excellent strength and modulus and a production process thereof. This fiber reinforced rubber composition includes fine short fibers of thermoplas tic polymer having NH groups buried in vulcanizable rubber. The vulcanizable rubber and the thermoplastic polymer are grafted to each other through a resol type alkylphenol formaldehyde resin precondensate or a novolak type phenol formaldehyde resin precondensate at an interface of the fiber. The ratio of the fiber to the vulcanizable rubber A 1 to 70 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber in the case of the resol type alkylphenol formaldehyde resin precondensate or B 1 to 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the rubber in the case of the novolak type phenol formal dehyde resin precondensate.
