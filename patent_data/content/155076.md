# Circuit breakers for direct and alternating current.

## Abstract
Circuit breakers which employ a capacitor to pass a current in opposition to a load current through a thyristor when interruption is required suffer from the disadvantage that high switching over voltages occur. In the present in vention current is diverted from the main thyristor T₁ through a resistor R₁ when thyristor T₂ and T₃ are fired to pass a commutating current from a capacitor C
