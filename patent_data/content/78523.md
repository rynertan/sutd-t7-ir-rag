# Electron gun for television camera tube.

## Abstract
An electron gun for a television camera tube comprises a cathode 20 for emission of electrons, a first grid 30 dis posed subsequently to the cathode and having a first aperture 36 supplied with a positive voltage relative to the cathode, a second grid 40 disposed subsequently to the first grid and having a second aperture 47 supplied with a higher positive voltage than that supplied to the first grid, and an intermediate grid 50 interposed between the first and second grids and having a hole 52 . The intermediate grid forms a divergent electron lens near the first aperture between the first and sec ond grids. An electron beam having passed through the first aperture is once diverged by the divergent electron lens to form a crossover 115 at an axial position of the gun which is remote from the first grid and at which the potential on axis is high, whereby broadening of the width of the velocity distribu tion of extracted electrons can be suppressed to a minimum and the amount of beam current passing through the second aperture 47 can be increased.
