# High pressure gas discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The high pressure gas discharge lmp according to the invention has electrodes which comprise an electrode rod 44 and a helical winding 46 near its tip 45 projecting into the lamp vessel, both of mainly tungsten. The winding 46 has a first layer of turns 47 directly around the rod 44 locally having a turn of high pitch. The winding 46 has around the first layer 47 another layer of turns 48 , which grips at least twice around a turn of high pitch of the first layer 47 , whilst forming contact areas 50 , and engages with clamping fit the rod 44 diametrically opposite thereto. As a result, the wind ing 46 is fixed on the rod 44 . It is sufficient for fixing when the other layer 48 grips only once around the turn of high pitch of the first layer 47 if the first layer 47 is integral with the other layer 48 .
