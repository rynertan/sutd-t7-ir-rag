# MULTIMODE RADAR

## Abstract
The invention relates to a radar system of the type which can be presented with a number of tasks to be per formed. Some of these tasks, e.g. the surveillance of areas at close range, may only require the transmission of low energy pulses and thus the full potential of the r.f. energy source has not previously been used whilst such tasks are being handled. By arranging for the tasks to be performed in a suitable overlapping sequence the full capability of the energy source is used at all times thereby increasing the throughput of tasks.
