# Movable connector for high voltage arrester.

## Abstract
A surge arrester block assembly for a high voltage arrester comprises a surge arrester block 34 , a connector 36 and means 40 for electrically and mechanically connecting the connector 36 to the block 34 to allow for movement of the connector 36 with respect to the arrester block 34 . The flexible connection thereby pro vided may be achieved by one or more wires 41, 42 or springs 42, 44 . Alternatively, it may include a ball and socket connection 70, 59 or a flat rope 48 bent into a U shape. A conductive plate 50 may be located between the block 34 and the flexible connection. There may be a plurality of blocks placed in end to end contact with each other. The invention also provides a gapless arrester com prising a dielectric housing 12 having a bore 22 a receptacle 23 and a probe 16 located in the receptacle. The surge arrester block assembly is positioned in the bore 22 and extends partially into the receptacle 23 to sup port the probe 16 .
