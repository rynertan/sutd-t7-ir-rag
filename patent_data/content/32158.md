# VIBRATION CONTROLLER FOR VEHICLE.

## Abstract
A vibration controller for a vehicle, which incorporates cylinders 4A , 4B for suppressing the vertical vibration of an automotive body 1 and a cylinder 4C for suppressing the lateral vibration provided in parallel with springs 3A , 3B for supporting the body 1 . Detection signals from vibration acceleration detectors 5A , 5B and 5C are com pensated by compensating circuits 6A , 6B and 6C . respectively, and further amplfiied through amplifiers 7A , 7B and 7C respectively, and applied to servo valves 8A , 8B and 8C , respectively, which control the internal pressures of the cylinders 4A , 4B and 4C , respectively. Since the compensating circuits 6A , 6B and 6C are so adapted that their transfer functions form the product of an integrating element, a primary leading element and primary lagging element there is no peak over a wide frequency range in the response of the vibration acceleration of the body 1 .
