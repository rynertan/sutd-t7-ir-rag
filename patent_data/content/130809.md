## Description
This invention relates to a novel method of preparing highly siliceous porous crystalline materials. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of preraring low alkali metal ZSM 5 type zeolites from a high solids forming mixture containing sources of silica, alkali metal, organic nitrogen cations and water, wherein amorphous precipitated silica is used as a source of silica in the zeolite forming mixture and alkylamines or alkyldiamines are used as the source of organic nitrogen cations. Zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversion. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicates having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X ray diffraction, within which there are a large number of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still smaller channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific zeolitic material. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as molecular sieves and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. Conventional methods for synthesizing porous crystalline zeolites have involved the preparation of a forming mixture from which the synthetic zeolite material can be crystallized. For example zeolites have been conventionally prepared from a hydrogel. Generally, silicate and aluminate solutions are mixed together, along with sources of alkali metal and quaternary nitrogen or phosphonium cations, to form a silicate hydrogel mixture which is subsequently hydrothermally crystallized to form the desired zeolite. Detailed descriptions of such conventional methods of preparing zeolites are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,702,886, 3,709,979, 4,088,605 and 4,148,713. Various types of silica have been used as silica sources in zeolite reaction mixtures in prior art zeolite synthesis methods. Such sources include silica gel, silica hydrosol, fumed silica, aluminosilicate clays, alkali metal silicates, colloidal silica, and precipitated silicas. U.S. Patent No. 4,275,047 to Whittam, for example, discloses a method of preparing ZSM 5 utilizing precipitated silica as the silica source. In the preparation of highly siliceous zeolites such as those having silica alumina ratios of at least 12, silica is the major component in the reaction mixture. The properties of the silica source including its particle size, solubility and reactivity may have an important effect on the characteristics of the zeolite produced. Conventional forming mixtures for producing highly siliceous zeolites which utilize conventional silica sources such as alkali metal silicates or colloidal silica are limited with respect to their ultimate post crystallization solids, i.e. zeolite, content. Conventional formulations of zeolite crystallizing media also generally become highly viscous as the silica source is added and are subject to gelation which interferes with agitation of the forming mixture as well as crystallization at solid levels greater than about 10 . Just as selection of silica source can affect the nature of the zeolite product produced, the type of template or directing agent, e.g., organic nitrogen cations, in the zeolite forming mixture can influence the properties of zeolites synthesized from the mixture. It is known, for example, from British Patent Specification No. 1,365,318 that alkyl amines can be used as templates for zeolite synthesis, and it is also known from U.S. Patent 4,151,189 that primary amines in particular are especially useful for promoting synthesis of zeolites containing especially low amounts of alkali metal. Likewise, U.S. Patent 4,139,600 teaches that alkyl diamines can be employed as directing agents in the synthesis of low alkali metal, e.g., low sodium zeolites. If alkyl amines or alkyl diamines are employed as directing agents in the synthesis of synthetic zeolites, use of conventional silica sources, e.g., sodium silicate, in the zeolite forming mixture can result in some difficulties in preparing zeolites of certain desired characteristics. When using conventional silica sources in combination with amine or diamine templates, it can be troublesome, for instance, to prepare zeolites of very small crystallite size, e.g., crystals of a size less than about 0.05 microns. The object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for synthesis of certain types of siliceous porous crystalline zeolites using a selected combination of a specific type of organic nitrogen directing agent and a specific type of silica source. In particular the present invention is directed to an improved method for preparing siliceous porous crystalline zeolites whereby an aqueous forming mixture containing sources of silica, alkali metal cations and organic nitrogen cations is prepared and is thereafter maintained under crystallization conditions. The improvement in such a method comprises the utilization as a silica source of an amorphous precipitated silica to thereby provide a non gelling forming mixture having a solids content greater than about 15 percent by weight and the utilization as a source of at least a portion of the organic nitrogen cations of an amine selected from certain monoamines and or diamines. Such monoamines can have the formula R₁R₂R₃N wherein R₁ is lower alkyl of 2 to 8 carbon atoms and R₂ and R₃ are each hydrogen or lower alkyl of 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Operable alkyl diamines are those wherein the alkyl group contains from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. The improved zeolite synthesis method of the present invention serves to form siliceous zeolite crystals having an SiO₂ Al₂O₃ molar ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index of from 1 to 12. As noted, one essential element of the present invention is the use of an amorphous precipitated silica as the silica source in a zeolite forming mixture. Such an amorphous precipitated silica can be a synthetic wet process, hydrated amorphous silica which preferably has a particle size range of from about 0.01 to 100 micrometres. More preferably, these silica particles are of a spherical shape with an average diameter of about 0.02 micrometres. Such particles tend to agglomerate in loose grape cluster structures. The precipitated silicas used in the present invention generally have an unusually large surface area, e.g., a surface area which preferably ranges from about 140 to 160 square meters per gram. Hi Sil , a product of PPG Industries Chemical Division, FK 320 , available from Degussa Corporation, QUSO from PQ Corporation, and ZEOFREE 80 manufactured by J.M. Huber Corporation, have all been found suitable as the amorphous precipitated silica to be used in the present invention. Use of an amorphous precipitated silica as the silica source in the preparation of highly siliceous zeolites results in several important advantages. The zeolite forming mixture employed in the present method is significantly higher in solids content than conventional forming mixtures which employ sodium silicate as the silica source. Conventional forming mixtures having a solids content of greater than about 10 by weight are subject to excessive gelation which results in the formation of a hard gel which inhibits zeolite crystallization. Consequently conventional forming mixtures are generally limited to solids levels of about 10 by weight. The particular high solids formulations of the present invention, on the other hand, contain 15 , or as much as 25 or even 40 solids or even more without any gel formation. This is especially true if the forming mixture, or the silica containing portion of it, is maintained throughout crystallization at a pH of 10.0 or less, preferably 9.0 or less. The high solids content of the forming mixture permits complete reaction of the zeolite forming components. This can provide an increase in zeolite yield of up to about 300 , over conventional preparations from hydrogel reaction mixtures without significantly increasing operating costs per pound of zeolite catalyst produced. The improved method of the present invention furthermore permits the use of a wide range of forming mixture agitation conditions resulting in greater flexibility in the control of crystal size of the zeolite product. Such improvement is probably the result of improved mass transfer due to the more fluid rheology of the reaction mixture. Control of the product crystal size permits the production of zeolites of reduced crystal size, say, e.g., .02 to .05 microns which exhibit improved activity over conventionally synthesized zeolites which are of generally larger crystal size. The use of a solid precipitated silica source is also believed to contribute a seeding effect to crystal formation. All of these factors result in a reduction of crystallization time which can result in a product of higher purity. The second essential element of the present invention involves the utilization of C₂ C₈ alkyl amines or C₂ C₂₀ alkyl diamines as the organic nitrogen template or directing agent in the zeolite forming mixture. As noted hereinbefore, amine and diamine materials of this type have been disclosed in British Patent Specification No. 1,365,318 U.S. Patent 4,151,189 and U.S. Patent 4,139,600. Primary amines and diamines are especially useful in promoting synthesis of zeolites having a very low percentage, e.g., less than about 0.14 percent by weight, and frequently less that about 0.1 percent by weight of alkaki metal, e.g., sodium, in the as synthesized form. Examples of suitable alkyl amine templates include triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, diethylamine, monoethylamine, n propylamine and n butylamine, with n propylamine being especially preferred. Examples of suitable alkyl diamine templates include ethylenediamine, propylenediamine, pentamethylenediamine and hexamethylenediamine, with hexamethylenediamine being especially preferred. It should be noted that the terms amine and diamine as used herein are meant to include amine and diamine salts as well as amines and diamines per se. Materials in any form which provide mono, di or trialkyl substituted nitrogen moieties in the forming mixture are, for purposes of the present invention, considered to be amines or diamines. It should also be noted that the improved synthesis method of the present invention can be carried out using a source of conventional tetraalkyl substituted quaternary ammonium or quaternary phosphonium cations in the forming mixture in addition to the alkyl amine or alkyl diamine. As noted in South African Patent Application No. 83 8250, mixtures of tetraalkyl substituted quaternary ammonium and amine templates can, in fact, be especially useful for the production of ZSM 5 and ZSM 11. Whether or not tetraalkyl substituted quaternary nitrogen species are also present, the important feature of the instant invention is that at least a portion of the organic nitrogen cations in the zeolite forming mixture must be derived from one or more of the alkyl amines or alkyl diamines hereinbefore described. The forming mixture employed in the present invention can be substantially free of alkyl halides. As noted hereinbefore, it is the combination of the use of an amorphous precipitated silica in a high solids forming mixture and the use of an alkyl amine or alkyl diamine template which provides an especially desirable method for producing low alkali metal zeolites, and especially low sodium ZSM 5. Because conventional silica sources generally produce low sodium crystals ranging from about 0.1 to 5 micronmetres, which are subject to greater aging and reduced activity, the method of the present invention is of particular value in obtaining low sodium ZSM 5 of small crystal size, e.g. crystallites ranging from about 0.01 to 0.08 microns, preferably about 0.01 to 0.05 micronmetres. The combination of an amorphous precipitated silica as a silica source and an amine or diamine template is employed in otherwise conventional zeolite forming mixtures which essentially contain water and a source of alkali metal, e.g., sodium hydroxide. The forming mixture can also contain optional ingredients such as sources of supplemental organic nitrogeneous cation templating agents, surfactants, soluble aluminum compounds, e.g., alum Al₂ SO₄ ₃ as well as seeds of the particular zeolite desired as product. Each of the components of the forming mixture are employed in amounts which provide suitable ratios of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, RN , M , OH and H₂O RN organic nitrogen, M alkali metal depending on the structure of the zeolite desired. For any given desired zeolite structure, the ratios of aforementioned oxides and ions in the forming mixture are those conventionally employed in known synthesis methods for that particular zeolite. In a preferred method of preparing the zeolite forming mixture, the forming mixture components are combined in such a way that the pH of the forming mixture, or the silica containing portion thereof, does not exceed 10. Thus, for example, the alkali metal source, e.g., sodium hydroxide, can be premixed with the organic nitrogen material or with the solution containing soluble aluminum compounds, e.g., alum, before combining this premixture with the amorphous precipitated silica. In this manner, exceedingly high pH conditions in the silica containing forming mixture are avoided, and accordingly the tendency of the high solids forming mixture to gel is reduced. The forming mixture of the present invention is maintained under crystallization conditions until formation of the desired siliceous porous crystalline zeolite is obtained. For example, crystallization according to the methods of the present invention can be effected in a single stage by heating the forming mixture to a temperature of about 60 to 200 C 140 to 392 F and holding there until a product having a crystallinity of about 30 to 100 is obtained. Optionally, the crystallization may be carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a product of about 30 to 70 crystallinity is obtained after about 2 to 100 hours, at temperatures ranging from about 60 to 100 C 140 to 212 F . The first stage product is then treated at higher temperatures of about 100 to 200 C 212 to 392 F for a shorter period of about 1 to 20 hours to produce a product having anywhere from about 50 to 100 crystallinity. Zeolites produced by the method of the present invention may have a silica to alumina ratio ranging from about 12 to infinity. Highly siliceous zeolites of the present invention have a silica to alumina ratio ranging from about 40 to greater than 200. Zeolites of generally lower silica to alumina ratios, say, less than about 70, are made from solutions containing soluble aluminum compounds such as alum. Zeolites of higher silica to alumina ratio e.g., greater than about 70 of the present invention can be made from caustic forming solutions containing NaOH, water, amorphous precipitated silica, and no intentionally added aluminum. The siliceous zeolite crystals produced by the method of the present invention also exhibit constrained access to and egress from their intercrystalline free space inasmuch as they have a constraint index of from 1 to 12. Such zeolite materials which have a silica to alumina molar ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index within the range of 1 to 12 are well known. Such zeolites and their use as catalysts for the conversion of organic compounds are generally described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,326,994. Crystalline zeoltes of the preferred type prepared in accordance with the method of the present invention include those having the structure of zeolite beta, ZSM 5, ZSM 5 ZSM 11 intermediate, ZSM 11, ZSM 12, ZSM 23, ZSM 35, ZSM 38, and ZSM 48, with ZSM 5 being particularly preferred. Zeolite beta is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,308,069 and RE 28,341, which patents disclose in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for zeolite beta. ZSM 5 is described in greater detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,702,886 and RE 29,948, which patents provide the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for the therein disclosed ZSM 5. ZSM 11 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,709,979, which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for ZSM 11.

ZSM 12 is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,832,449, which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for ZSM 12. ZSM 23 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,076,842, which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for ZSM 23. ZSM 35 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,016,245, which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for ZSM 35. ZSM 38 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,859, which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for ZSM 38. ZSM 48 is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,375,573, which discloses in particular the X ray diffraction pattern of and a synthesis method for ZSM 48. The siliceous porous crystalline zeolites prepared by the method of the present invention are useful as catalysts to promote catalytic conversion of organic compounds, e.g., hydrocarbons and or oxygenates. Prior to catalytic use of the zeolite crystals produced by this invention, it is desirable to calcine the crystals at temperatures of at least 250 C in order to remove organic nitrogen cations from the zeolite. For catalytic purposes, the zeolite crystals prepared in accordance with the present invention can also be combined in known manner with metals of Groups IB to VIII of the Periodic Table, including, by way of example, nickel, copper, zinc, palladium, platinum, calcium or rare earth metals.
