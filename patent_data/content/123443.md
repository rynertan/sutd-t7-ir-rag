# METHOD OF ANALYZING WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLE

## Abstract
A method of quantitative analysis of an analyte contained in a whole blood sample using a multilayer analytical element comprising a transparent support, at least one reagent layer and a porous spreading layer capable of supplying a liquid sample spotted on the surface of said spreading layer to said reagent layer keeping a substantially constant volume per unit area, the method comprising spotting the whole blood sample on the porous spreading layer which is characterized in that the whole blood sample is a blood sample prepared by dilution of a whole blood with an aqueous diluent in a specified volume ratio.
