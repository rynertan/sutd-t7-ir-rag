# Device for measuring liquid flow volume with temperature compensating.

## Abstract
A device for metering fuel volume in a conduit 14 has a flow meter 12 connected to a computer 20 via a pulse encoder 24 . The computer provides an output on a display 34 . The computer is connected to a temperature sensor 18 in the conduit 14 for temperature compensation and incorporates components 208, 209 for correcting errors in the circuitry. The computer 20 contains stored information relating to specific gravity of different fuels whereby the device can be calibrated by selecting the appropriate specific gravity and without requiring actual fluid flow.
