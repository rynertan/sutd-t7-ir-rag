## Description
This invention relates to therapeutic peptides. ACTH like neuropeptides can facilitate nerve regeneration in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Bijlsma et al. In general, the invention features a peptide of the formula In a preferred example of the peptide A¹ is H, A³ is Gln and A⁴ is Tyr. As we explain below, a therapeutically effective amount of the peptide and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier substance, e.g. magnesium carbonate or lactose, together form a therapeutic composition for aiding in regenerating nerves of the peripheral nervous system and the brain. The composition can be in the form of a pill, tablet, capsule, liquid, or sustained release tablet for oral administration a liquid for nasal administration or a liquid for intravenous, subcutaneous, parenteral, or intra peritoneal administration. Other features and advantages will be apparent from the following description of preferred examples. We now describe the structure, synthesis, and use of preferred examples. The peptides described herein have the general formula. The peptides can be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of preferred salts are those of therapeutically acceptable organic acids, e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, salicylic, methanesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, or pamoic acid, as well as polymeric acids such as tannic acid or carboxymethyl cellulose, and salts with inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, or phosphoric acid. The synthesis of H D Ala Gln Tyr Phe Arg Trp Gly NH₂ follows. Other peptides can be prepared by making appropriate modifications of the following synthetic method. The first step is the preparation of D Ala Gln Tyr Phe Arg Trp Gly benzhydrylamine resin, as follows. Benzyhydrylamine polystyrene resin Bachem, Inc. 1.00 g, 0.5 mmole in the chloride ion form is placed in the reaction vessel of a Beckman 990B peptide synthesizer programmed to perform the following reaction cycle a CH₂Cl₂ b 33 trifluoroacetic acid CH₂Cl₂ 2 times for 1 and 25 min. each c CH₂Cl₂ d ethanol e CH₂Cl₂ f 10 triethylamine in CHCl₃ and g CH₂Cl₂. The neutralized resin is stirred with Boc glycine and diisopropylcarbodiimide 1.5 mmole in CH₂Cl₂ for 1 hour and the resulting amino acid resin is then cycled through steps a to g in the above wash program. The following amino acids 1.5 mmole are then coupled successively by the same procedure Boc Trp, Boc tosyl Arg, Boc Phe, Boc carbenzoxy His, Boc Gln, and Boc D Ala. From the above resin is prepared H D Ala Gln Tyr Phe Arg Trp Gly NH₂, as follows. A mixture of the above heptapeptide resin, The peptide is then dissolved in a minimum volume of 50 acetic acid and eluted on a column 2.5 x 100 mm of Sephadex G 25. Fractions containing a major component, as determined by u.v. absorption and thin layer chromatography tlc are pooled and evaporated to a small volume This material is found to be homogeneous by hplc and tlc. Amino acid analysis of an acid hydrolysate confirms the composition of the peptide. When administered to a mammal e.g., orally, intravenously, parenterally, nasally, or by suppository , the peptides are effective in aiding in regenerating nerves of the peripheral and central nervous systems following nerve damage. The peptides are administered beginning directly following the injury, for a period of ten days or more. Administration is daily or every other day. The peptides can be used to treat nerve crush lesions and neuropathies of alcoholic, diabetic, or toxic substance exposure origins. The peptides can also be used to aid in suturing severed nerves. The peptides can promote the growth of new nerve processes, as well as enhance the connection of nerves to muscles. The peptides can be administered to a patient in a dosage of 1 mcg kg day to 250 mcg kg day, preferably 5 100 mcg kg day.
