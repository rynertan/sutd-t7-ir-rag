# An electric control device for a central heating boiler.

## Abstract
An electric control device for a central heating boiler which is provided with a water pump or an air ventilator 6 , a burner with an electrically operated shut off valve 5 and an electric control circuit comprising a supply transformer 1 and a series circuit connected to the secondary winding of said transformer and composed of the control winding 4 of the shut off valve 5 , the contact of a room or regulator thermostat 3 and, if present, the contact of a maximum thermostat 2 and in which the water pump or air ventilator 6 is connected in parallel with the primary winding of the supply transformer. The control device comprises a circuit to be connected to the contact of the room or regulator thermostat 3 including a high resistance value series resistor Rs to be connected into the mains supply circuit of the boiler, a relay 13 with a normally open contact k connected in parallel to said series resistor R
