## Description
AN IMPROVED CARGO TRAILEROver a relatively short period of time, transport work of all kinds has been enormously facilitated thanks to both vehicles as well as goods transfer areas having been adequately conditioned.Nonetheless, trailers and semi trailers are sometimes inappropriate and practically always inconvenient for transferring goods from one vehicle to another, or from a vehicle to a storage area or vice versa.One of the problems that arises and where attempts are made to find a solution is that only angular and or linear motion is required of the trailer chassis in all the working positions of the trailer and the load, and its wheels never lose contact with the ground, while sometimes it is achieved that said motions disappear.With this improvement, it is possible to ensure that the centre of gravity of the trailer or semi trailer shifts very little from one position to another even when such trailer or semi trailer adopts one or another working position, and this is because the chassis and wheels undergo minimal travel.This invention is concerned with an improved cargo trailer which is comprised of a chassis with at least one set of wheels, and a load assembly attached to said chassis and comprising an over chassis and or load container, where said trailer is peculiar insofar that it is comprised of a A scissor arm arrangement where the arms are pivotally joined to one another at one end, while at the other end, one of them is pivotally attached to the load assembly and the other is pivotally attached to the chassis b A fluid operated cylinder that is pivotally linked by at least one of its ends to one of the ends of the scissor arm arrangement c At least one anchoring point on the rear portion of the load assembly, and at least one anchoring point on the rear portion of the chassis.Anchoring means are moreover provided, the ends of which are pivotally attached and linked to an anchoring point on the load assembly and to an anchoring point on the chassis.Figure 1 is an enlarged view of a positioning device 70 on the draw bar 81 for towing the trailer.Figure 2 shows the semi trailer of the preceding figure in readiness for raising the load container, where it is seeking the loading or unloading height upon another vehicle lorry or trailer , or upon a stock pile.Figure 3 depicts the semi trailer shown in the previous figures in the fully tipped position at 90 degrees.Figure 4 shows another kind of trailer in its travelling position, and in it can be observed the draw bar 81 for towing by the tractor unit, and the fixed support 82 which is withdrawn whilst the semi trailer is in motion and placed at the towing hook height so as to allow draw bar 81 to engage with tow hooks on all different kinds of tractor units. Figure 4 provides moreover, an enlarged view of the travelling anchorage 17 between the chassis 1 and the load container 16 . For the travelling position and other positions where the trailer is tipped, except for those in which the cargo container 16 is separated from the chassis 1 , travelling anchor point 17 is position at the end attachment 27c on the load container 16 . In the fully tipped position, where the container stands at right angles to the ground, as for example in Figure 1, travelling anchor position 17 is located at the inner attachment 27a of said load container 16 . Travelling anchor position 17 is able to slide upon the chassis 1 and is secured thereto by means of pins 20 .The purpose of the over chassis is to allow a range of different load containers 16 to be used. Once the appropriate load container 16 for the purpose has been chosen, it is rigidly secured to the over chassis. The over chassis and the load container 16 shall hereinafter be called the load assembly 916 .A trailer or semi trailer is provided with a chassis 1 , with an over chassis optionally, and in any event with a load container 16 , together with one or two sets of wheels 2 , 2 bis according to whether the equipment is a semi trailer or a trailer proper, and a draw bar 81 for hooking up to a tractor unit.Chassis 1 and load assembly 916 are coupled to one another by means of scissor arm arrangement 10 which is comprised of two arms 10 1 and 10 2 that are pivotally joined together 101 , where arm 10 1 is pivotted at a1 to load assembly 916 , while arm 10 2 is pivotted to the chassis at a2 . A fluid operated cylinder 10 is fitted onto said scissor arm arrangement 10 and pivotted thereto at a3 and a4 .When said cylinder 10 exerts a thrust upon either of arms 10 1 , it causes load assembly 916 to swivel about pivots 27 with chassis 1 , and thus make load assembly 916 adopt the tipped position with respect to chassis 1 .Hydro pneumatic cylinder 10 provides a telescopic arrangement whereby with a minimal space requirement, all working positions can be obtained between the load container 16 and the over chassis or load container 16 alone if appropriate with respect to the chassis 1 .The load assembly 916 possesses three fixed anchorage points 27a , 27b , 27c at its rear, of which the middle one 27b is the highest and takes the pivotal joints.Chassis 1 possesses at its rear an arm 3 which is pivotted at 31 to chassis 1 , and is comprised of two parts 3a and 3b that are telescopically assembled together.A second fluid operated cylinder 4 is also provided, and is pivotted at 41 to the chassis 1 , and at 42 to the arm 3 .Chassis 1 also embodies a fixed anchorage point 28 which is prolonged towards the bottom of same, and is located at the back of the rear set of wheels 2 .In the above structural arrangement, the most common working positions for which the ensuing description is given, are as follows The travelling position, as depicted in Figure 1. When the load assembly 916 lies horizontal and is resting upon the chassis 1 , arm 3 is held horizontal, and the end of its portion 3b is pivotted at 27c to the load assembly 916 . The scissor arrangement 10 and fluid operated cylinder 10 are held in the retracted position.When draw bar 81 on the trailer or semi trailer is hooked up, the tractor unit draws upon same in order to convey said trailer or semi trailer in the loaded or unloaded condition from one location to another. In this position, fixed pivot 27a is free, fixed pivot 27b may be either free or coupled to fixed anchorage 28 , and fixed pivot 27c is attached to arm 3 , although fixed pivot 27a may also become attached, in which case fixed pivot 27c is free. The lifting post ion for the purpose of tipping onto another vehicle, onto another trailer, or onto a stock pile, as depicted in Figure 2. With portion 3b of arm 3 pivotted to fixed anchorage 27c , and with anchorage 27b free from anchorage 28 , cylinders 4 and 10 are operated to respectively make arm 3 swivel about its pivot 31 onto the chassis, and open the scissor arm arrangement 10 . The slope angle a will obviously depend upon the width to which scissor arms 10 open, and angle ss through which arm 3 has swivelled. In this position, fixed pivots 27a and 27b are free. The full tipped position at right angles or 90 degrees to the ground, as depicted in Figure 3. With portion 3b of arm 3 pivotted at 27a , and with fixed anchorage 28 pivotted at 27b , cylinder 10 is operated thus opening the scissor arm arrangement 10 until the back face of the load assembly 916 rests upon the ground. To return to the travelling position, cylinder 10 is relieved of its load, the tip of portion 3b on arm 3 is engaged upon fixed anchorage 27a , and cylinder 4 is operated to cause arm 3 to swivel about its pivot 31 on the chassis and thus afford an initial tipping thrust. The remainder of the tipping motion of the load assembly is brought about either through its own weight, if cylinder 10 is a single acting cylinder, or with the aid of said cylinder 10 if it is a double acting cylinder.In the case of the trailer as shown in Figure 4, chassis 1 can turn with respect to pivot 4 in the set of wheels 2 , and so there is no need of any assistance for the various load positions of cylinder 4 , and instead use is made of a head 7 attached to chassis 1 , to which a hydraulic cylinder 8 is pivotally joined, the opposite end of same being secured to the tractor unit draw bar 81 .The use of this cylinder makes differing positions of chassis 1 possible.In the case of the semi trailer Figures 2 and 3 , the draw bar 81 on the trailer or semi trailer is pivotted at 811 to the set of steering wheels 2 bis which are capable of turning in a horizontal plane.Draw bar 81 is moreover associated with the main chassis 1 by means of device 7 which is capable of positioning the draw bar assembly 81 and set of wheels 2 bis in relation to said main chassis 1 to fix it, or to release them and thus allow the aforementioned motion of the steering wheels 2 bis and the draw bar 81 in the horizontal plane. Said device 70 Figure 1 is comprised of two bodies 71 and 72 , which are assembled telescopically one upon the other. Body 71 is pivotted at its free end 74 to the trailer or semi trailer chassis 1 . Body 72 is pivotted at its free end 73 to the draw bar 81 . The above mentioned assembly may equally be mounted the opposite way about without detracting from the essential features of the invention.Body 71 possesses a plurality of holes 711 arranged in line with one another.Body 72 possesses a plurality of holes 721 arranged in line with one another.When pairs of holes 711 and 721 are placed opposite each other and a pin is inserted through them, set of wheels 2 bis and the draw bar 81 are located in position with respect to chassis 1 .Without altering the essential features of the invention in any way, device 70 may be fluid operated by means of a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder, and here it is necessary to pivot its body 72 to the draw bar 81 at 73 , and its plunger to the chassis 1 at 74 , or vice versa.
