# Apparatus for shaping coiled slide fastener coupling elements.

## Abstract
A coupling element shaper 11 comprises a pair of externally threaded screw members 40, 41 corotatable in a common direction A, B and disposed parallelly on opposite sides of a mandrel 14 along which a core thread 16 is fed while a filamentary material 35 is wound around the mandrel 14 into a row of helically coiled coupling elements 36 . Each screw member 40, 41 has a portion varying in pitch to gradually reduce in a direction from one end to the opposite end thereof. The core thread 16 is squeezed by the coupling elements 36 as shaped by such portion so as to have a certain degree of stretchability which can cancel or take out its shrinkage when the coupling elements 36 are sewn to a slide fastener stringer tape.
