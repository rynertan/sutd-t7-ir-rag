## Description
SPECIFICATION SILENT CHAIN FIELD OF ART The present invention relates to a silent chain.in which transmission capacity per chain weight is enhanced. BACKGROUND ART As shown in Figs. 1 to 3, a conventional Z I silent chain 1 is constructed such that a plurality of meshing links 2 are superposed one upon another lengthwise and widthwise, guide links 3 are disposed on both outer sides of the chain, and they are connected by connecting pins 4. The meshing link 2 is meshed with a sprocket tooth 6 to transmit power, and the guide link 3 is merely provided to prevent the chain from being disengaged from the sprocket, and is not meshed with the sprocket not contributing to power transmission at all between the chain and the sprocket. Accordingly, when we think of the transmission capacity of the conventional silent chain 1 with respect to the sprocket, in a row provided with the guide links 3, power is transmitted by two meshing links 2, and in a row not provided with the guide links 3 , power is transmitted by three meshing links 2. Thus, the transmission capacity of the entire chain 1 is limited by the strength of the surfaces of two meshing links 2. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a silent chain which can enhance transmission capacity by using links, arranged as guide links on both sides of the chain, which have a function as a meshing link in addition to a function as a guide link. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION That is, the present invention provides a silent chain wherein a plurality of link plates having a shape to mesh with sprocket teeth are superposed one upon another lengthwise and widthwise of the chain, which are connected widthwise by connecting pins, guide links provided on both outer sides having a central lower portion buldged outwardly to provide a groove to mesh with the sprocket teeth and a side guide portion.With this arrangement, as compared with a conventional silent chain in which guide links not directly contributed to power transmission in cooperation with the sprocket are mounted on both sides of the chain, transmission capacity per chain weight is enhanced and since the width of sprocket can be enlarged through guide link portions on both sides, better stability of chain is obtained. In addition, it is possible to obtain a chain which is inexpensive and excellent in transmission capacity. Accordingly, if the silent chain of the present invention is applied to a motorcycle or the.like, the chain is light weight to thereby improve fuel cost, vibration of the chain is min imized to thereby simplify and miniaturize a tensioner Ã³r the like and a pressing force of the tensioner can be also reduced to thereby decrease a friction loss to improve transmission efficiency. Moreover, the present invention silent chain wherein a plurality of link plates having a shape to mesh with sprocket teeth are superposed one upon another lengthwise and widthwise of the chain, which are connected widthwise by connecting pins, said chain including a guide yoke of which inner surface is guided by the side of the sprocket teeth when meshed, said guide yoke being provided at a lower portion externally of a meshing groove in the central portion of the widthwise and outermost link plate, and a cavity formed at an upper portion in the central portion of said meshing groove.With this arrangement, as compared with a conventional chain, the chain of the present invention is light weight to thereby enhance transmission capacity per chain weight, weight per unit length of chain is reduced to thereby prevent noises resulting from vibrations and to minimize tear and wear of the sprocket teeth, and transmission load applied to the respective link plates is reduced to increase durability of the chain and enhance transmission capacity.

BEST MODES FORPRACTICINGTHE PRESENT INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. Referring to Figs. 4 to 9, a silent chain 1 is constructed such that a plurality of meshing links 2 are superposed one upon another lengthwise and widthwise, guide links 3 are disposed on both outer sides of the chain, and they are connected by connect ing pins 4. In the guide link 3 of this embodiment, a conventional flat plate guide link 3 formed with inclined surfaces 5 at both ends see Fig. 10 having the same surface angle with that of the meshing link 2 has its central lower portion buldged outwardly to thereby form a groove 7 to mesh with a sprocket tooth 6 and a side guide portion 8 guided by the side of the sprocket tooth 6 numeral 9 designates a hole bored through which a connecting pin is inserted , whereby the guide link 3 is meshed with the sprocket tooth 6 similarly to the meshing link 2 and has a guide function in which the buldged side guide portion 8 prevents disengagement when the sprocket meshes with the chain. Fig. 11 and thereafter show a second embodiment. This silent chain 11 is constructed such that a plurality of link plates 12 are superposed one upon another lengthwise and widthwise of the chian and connected by connecting pins 14 widthwise, said chain including a guide yoke 17 inner surface of which is guided by the side of the sprocket teeth, said guide yoke being provided at a lower portion externally of a meshing groove 15 of the widthwise and outermost link plate 13, and a cavity formed at an upper portion in the central portion of the meshing groove 15. Thus, since the outermost link plate 13 has a tooth 19 accurately meshed with the sprocket tooth 16 and the guide yoke 17 accurately guided by the side of the sprocket tooth 16, the link plate 13 can perform both guide function which prevents disengagement from the sprocket tooth 16 and function similar to the link plate 12 which meshes with the sprocket tooth 16. It will be noted that the cavity 18 formed in the outermost link plate 13.may have any size and shape within the range not impeding tensile strength of the silent chain. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The silient chain in accordance with the present invention is suitable for use as powertransmission means for machine tools, internal combustion engines and the like,and is particularly suitable for use for power transmission of motorcycles.
