# SELECTIVE LAYERING OF SUPERABSORBENTS IN MELTBLOWN SUBSTRATES

## Abstract
The invention generally provides for formation of melt blown material containing wood fiber on to a continuous foram inous belt. During formation a polymer and wood fiber first layer is applied to a moving belt from at least one bank of melt blown forming apparatus. This first layer does not contain su perabsorbent. The belt carrying the first layer passes beneath at least one further source of meltblown fiber into which super absorbent is added along with the wood fibers. This provides at least one additional layer integrally connected to the first formed layer and having superabsorbent properties. The first layer acts to aid in trapping of any superabsorbent which is not immediately entangled in the meltblown and wood fibers and prevents it passing through the forming belt.
