# Photoconductive element for use in electrophotographic copying processes.

## Abstract
Photoconductive element for use in electrophotographic copying processes, which element in the given sequence is composed of an electrically conductive support, a barrier layer consisting of a doped hydrogen containing amorphous silicon, an intermediate layer consisting of substantially undoped hy drogen containing amorphous silicon, an intermediate barrier layer consisting of doped hydrogen containing amorphous sili con and a main layer consisting of substantially undoped hy drogen containing amorphous silicon. The composite of sili con layers has a low dark discharge rate.
