A video golf machine enables players to play simulated golf against each other. The machine presents a picture or plan of each hole of a selected golf course, including the length of the hole, slope 19 of the ground, positions of boundaries and of obstacles such as trees 17 , shrubs, bunkers 13 and water 15 for example. For each game conditions may change such as wind direction 20 and strength, temperature, humidity, surface condition, condi tion of each green and any other variable affecting all players alike. Each player selects type of club and strength and direction of shot for each shot.
