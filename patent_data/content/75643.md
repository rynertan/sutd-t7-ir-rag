# INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
Internal combustion engine comprising a cylinder block 1 including a cylinder and a piston 3 reciprocally movable within the cylinder, a cylinder head 2 provided with suction ports 5a, 5b and an exhaust port 11 open to the cylinder, respectively suction and exhaust valves 6a, 6b, 8 provided adjacent to the upper dead point of the piston. The suction valves 6a, 6b are disposed substantially uprightly in the direction of movement of the piston 3 and the exhaust valve 8 is inclined wtth respect to the direction of move ment of the piston with the bottom of the exhaust valve directing towards the suction valves to define the combus tion chamber 12 between the bottom of the exhaust valve and the upper surface of the head of the piston 3 .
