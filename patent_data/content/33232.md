# Developers and methods of processing radiation sensitive plates using the same.

## Abstract
A developer for processing image wise exposed radia tion sensitive plates based on organic solvent soluble diazo resins or certain photocrosslinkable resins or photo polymerisable olefinically unsaturated compounds includes a surfactant and a salt of an aliphatic carboxylic acid containing up to nine carbon atoms. The developer is substantially aque ous and has a reduced tendency to foam formation. It is useful in the photomechanical production of lithographic printing plates.
