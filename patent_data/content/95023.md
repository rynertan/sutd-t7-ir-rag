# CONTACT KEYBOARD WITH FINGER CONTROLLED N KEY ROLLOVER

## Abstract
A keyboard 17 has plural keys 15 arranged for conventional touch keying. Each key 15 has an associated contact switch and the switches are electrically arranged in matrix form. Electrically connected columns of switches correspond to keys 15 actuated by a common finger 14 in conventional touch keying. Each switch in an electrically connected column of switches is connected to a different one of row sense lines. A two or three key rollover function with phantom key lockout is provided by a microprocessor which ignores simultaneous switch closures of switches 37 lo cated in a common column of electrically connected switches.
