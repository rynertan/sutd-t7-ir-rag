# Process for the manufacture of glass sheets.

## Abstract
A process for the manufacture of glass sheets 10 , particularly electrically heated backlites EHB s includes applying an opaque deposite, e.g. a band 12 to a surface of that sheet. The opaque band is formed from a radiation curable paste which includes both a filler material which can fuse to the glass sheet when heated to a fusion temperature and a radiation curable material which is heat decomposable into components which are nonreactive with the glass sheet when heated to a fusion temperature. The radiation curable material is cured thereby to form a temporary bond of the radiation curable paste to the surface of the glass sheet. As an optional step in order to form an EHB, a pattern 14 of electrically conductive material is deposited on the surface of the glass sheet. This conductive material contains at least one component which is heat fusable with the surface of the glass sheet when heated to the fusion temperature. The glass sheet is passed through a heating lehr which heats the various elements to the fusion temperature whereby the fusable materials are fused to the surface of the glass sheet and the radiation curable material is heat decomposed into component which are nonreactive with the surface of the glass sheet.
