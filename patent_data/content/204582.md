## Abstract
A calendered composite non woven sheet 70 consist ing of a polyolefin synthetic pulp layer optionally containing wood pulp, and an adhesive binder, is adhered by the adhesive binder to a continuous filament scrim 2 . The pulp surface of the composite 70 has an unexpectedly high abrasion resistance, and the composite sheet 70 is suitable for uses as a home air infiltration barrier, outdoor signs and banners, commercial mail envelopes and medical operation room drapery. The composite non woven sheet 70 is preferably formed on a conventional Fourdrinier machine by depositing the pulp from the headbox 15 onto the upper surface of the spun bonded continuous filament scrim 2 .
