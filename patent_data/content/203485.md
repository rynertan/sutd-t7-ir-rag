It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for treating ammonium phosphate fertilizer solution prior to its use in fast setting cements. Other objects and advantages of the present invention are shown throughout the specification. In accordance with the present invention, a process has now been discovered for treating ammonium phosphate fertilizer solution so that, after combination with a magnesium containing compound at ambient temperatures, an improved magnesium phosphate fast setting cement results which comprises adding an effective amount of an acidic phosphate additive to the fertilizer solution to yield the improved cement. In this process the additive can be polyphosphoric acid, orthophosphoric acid, monoammonium phosphate, monomagnesium phosphate and mixtures thereofSufficient additive can be added to reduce the pyrophosphate content of the fertilizer below 8 weight percent of the fertilizer. The treated fertilizer solution thus formed can be mixed with a magnesium containing compound and an aggregate at ambient temperatures to form a fast setting cementitious composition. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Ammonium phosphate fertilizer solutions have heretofore been known to be suitable for use as the phosphate source in fast setting magnesium phosphate cement of the type contemplated in the present invention. This fertilizer solution contains a mixture of orthophosphate and condensed phosphate species. In its original aqueous state, this fertilizer undergoes continuous hydrolysis while standing whereby the weight ratios of the different phosphate species keep changing, usually from high polyphosphate and low orthophosphate contents to low polyphosphate and high orthophosphate contents as the fertilizer ages. The condensed phosphates of this fertilizer solution can include pyro , tri , tetra , etc.phosphate species. Because of this continuous hydrolysis, magnesium phosphate cements using liquid ammonium phosphate fertilizer as the phosphate source exhibit unpredictable qualities. Usually, when a fresh fertilizer solution is used, the cement mixture does not set at all or only forms a weak cement, and when an older fertilizer solution is used, the cement sets very rapidly with little or no working time to apply the cement. Liquid fertilizer solution also precipitates hard to handle insolubles upon standing and in cold weather the liquid freezes and gels, creating more handling problems. These liquid fertilizer solutions are readily available commercial products. They are usually designated, e.g. 10 34 0, wherein the first number represents the weight concentration of ammoniacal nitrogen, the second number represents the weight concentration of P 205 and the third number represents the weight concentration of potassium oxide. This invention contemplates a process for treating these fertilizers to yield consistent and improved fastsetting magnesium phosphate cements. The consistency and improvement being primarily related to the final compressive strength of the concrete structure formed by these cements and secondarily to the length of the setting time. A particularly preferred fertilizer solution is Poly Ne 10 34 0 ammonium phosphate solution supplied by ArcadianCompany and used primarily as an agricultural fertilizer. A. typical analysis of the Poly Ne brand fertilizer shows 10.0 weight percent ammoniacal nitrogen and 34 weight percent total P2O5. Usually, sixty percent of the total P205 is polyphosphate. This commercial product contains approximately 2 weight percent of impurities, which usually do not adversely affect its use in preparing the fast .setting cements of this invention. The major impurities comprise approximately 0.5 weight percent iron, 0.5 weight percent sulfur, 0.2 weight percent magnesium as MgO and 0.15 weight percent of fluorine. This commercial product also contains approximately 50 weight percent water. In this process the liquid fertilizer is treated by the addition of an acidic phosphate additive. This additive is added to the liquid fertilizer in an amount effective to yield an improved cement. One measure of an effective amount of the additive is the addition of sufficient additive to reduce the initial pyrophosphate content of the fertilizer. The pyrophosphate content of the fertilizer is initially within the range of from about 8 weight percent to about 15 weight percent expressed as P2 05. It has been found that ideally the pyrophosphate content of the fertilizer should be reduced to below about 8 weight percent of the fertilizer. Several phosphate additives have been identified which are effective in reducing the pyrophosphate content of the fertilizer. These additives include polyphosphoric acid, orthophosphoric acid, monoammonium phosphate, monomagnesium phosphate and mixtures thereof. The effective amount of the additive added depends on the nature of the additive used. A certain amount of experimentation is needed to determine the effective amount of a particular phosphate additive to be used in a particular fertilizer solution. However, amounts of additive ranging from about 1 percent by weight of the liquid fertilizer to about 10 percent by weight are usually operative in this invention. When the acidic phosphate additive is polyphosphoric acid, this acid should contain sufficient hydrogen ions to facilitate hydrolysis of the fertilizer solution. An orthophosphoric acid containing polyacid, e.g. 50 weight percent or more orthophosphoric acid, with a low pyrophosphoric acid content is preferred because sufficient hydrogen ions are available and the contribution of the additive to the total pyrophosphate content of the fertilizer is minimized. The pH of the ammonium phosphate fertilizer solution before treatment with the phosphate additive is usually about neutral, i.e. a pH from about 6.5 to 7.5. After treatment, the particular pH can depend upon the age of the original fertilizer solution and the amount and type of phosphate additive used in the treatment step, however the pH is usually reduced to a pH range from about 4.0 to 6.0 with a pH of 5.0 being a preferred target. The improvement achieved by the process and composition of this invention is particularly apparent when a fresh ammonium phosphate fertilizer solution is treated as compared with an aged solution. The observable differences in cement performance are more dramatic and consistent between fresh untreated fertilizer solution and fresh treated fertilizer solution. The differences in cement performance are less consistent between aged untreated fertilizer solution and aged treated fertilizer solution. The treated liquid fertilizer can then be mixed with a magnesium containing compound at ambient temperatures to form a fast setting magnesium phosphate cement. A composition capable of forming a fast setting cement at ambient temperatures can be formulated from the treated liquid fertilizer of this invention. This composition comprises a an ammonium phosphate fertilizer solution which has been treated by a process comprising adding an effective amount of a phosphate additive to the fertilizer solution to improve the resulting fast setting cement and b a magnesium containing compound. This magnesium containing compound is capable of reacting with the treated fertilizer solution to form a monolithic solidThis composition reacts and yields a fast setting cement of. consistent and predictable quality. Generally the fast setting cement of this invention can be used for producing fast setting concrete structures e.g. structures suitable for roadway construction and roadway patches or other load bearing uses, however in its broader aspects, the invention is generally applicable in preparing concrete structures with various characteristics e.g. high or low strength, for a variety of other purposes as well. The characteristics of any particular concrete structures formed can depend upon the weight ratio of the various components, the nature of the aggregate employed, the temperature conditions of application and the curing conditions as well as other factors. Fast setting cement can be applied indoors or outdoors to concrete drives, storage yards, warehouse and factory floors to repair and restore damaged surfaces.Fast setting cement can be used to fill structural cracks in slabs and repair highway median barrier walls. This type of cement can be used in almost any situation requiring a quick, permanent repair of concrete at ambient temperatures.In addition, the fast setting cement can be used for binding and coating metals and woods for structural and flame resistant applications. Generally, the setting time for these fast setting cements vary widely and can range from a few seconds up to several minutes. As a practical matter, the setting time must be sufficient to allow the magnesium containing compound and optional aggregate to be thoroughly mixed with the treated fertilizer to form a slurry or a non collapsible putty and be applied to the intended area, whether a mold or a patch, prior to hardening into a monolithic solid. In quantitative terms, fast setting means that the cement hardens in less than 30 minutes, usually in about 1 to 10 minutes, and reaches more than 500 psi of compressive strength in usually less than 2 hours. The composition of the present invention comprises .. treated fertilizer solution and a magnesium containing compound. The preferred magnesium containing compounds are.magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide and magnesium carbonate. These compounds must be capable of reacting at ambient temperatures with the treated fertilizer solution ta form a monolithic solid. Mixtures of these magnesium compounds can also be employed. A particularly preferred magnesium containing compound contains MgO. This MgO can be of low reactivity, of high reactivity or a mixture of low and high reactivity wherein the ratio of the constituents of the mixture is selected to achieve the working time and cement strength desired. This preferred MgO can usually be from about 4 percent to about 50 percent by weight of the overall composition. A particulate aggregate, preferably graded sand, can be included in the composition in a controlled amount as a filler. Aggregate can greatly enhance the strength of the hardened concrete cement. Aggregate usage can range from 0 percent to about 90 percent by weight of the composition with a range of from about 40 percent to about 80 percent by weight of the composition being preferred. Other aggregate materials which can be used include particles of competent rocks or rock forming minerals such as granite, basalt, dolomite, andesite, feldspar, amphibole, pyroxene, olivine, gabbro, rhyolite, syenite, diorite, dolerite, peridotite, trachyte, obsidian, quartz, etc., as well as materials such as slag, cinders, fly ash, glass cullet, wood chips and fibrous materials such as chopped metal wire preferably steel , glass fibers, asbestos, cotton, and polyester and aramide fibers.Aggregates having different particle shapes and sizes can be used. Mixtures of different aggregates can also be used. The various compositions of this invention react at ambient temperatures resulting in the production of unique fast setting cements. In a particular embodiment of the composition according to this invention, the liquid ammonium phosphate fertilizer solution is treated with an additive selected from the group consisting of polyphosphoric acid containingsufficient hydrogen ions to facilitate hydrolysis of the fertilizer solution, orthophosphoric acid, monoammonium phosphate, monomagnesium phosphate and mixtures thereof the magnesium containing compound is magnesium oxide and the aggregate is silica. The resulting cement should exhibit acceptable strength and adequate working time. The following Examples describe certain embodiments of this invention. Other embodiments will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from a consideration of this specification or practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specifications and Examples be considered as exemplary only, with the true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the claims which follow the Examples.
