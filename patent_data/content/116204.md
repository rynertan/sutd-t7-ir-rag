# Servo system for an optical memory.

## Abstract
To desensitize the write channel of a direct read after write optical memory 11 from time dependent changes in the operating characteristics of the hardware, and from time and position dependent variations in the performance characteristics of the record medium 12 , the present invention provides a real time feedback system for adjusting the output power of the write laser 13 or similar source and or for adjusting the modulation timing of the write beam so as to null out any unwanted DC component that is exhibited by the recorded data during the direct read after write process. In other words, the feedback stabilizes the timing of the transitions in the recorded data.
