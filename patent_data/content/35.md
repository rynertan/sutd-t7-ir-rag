## Abstract
α Amino Acids, compositions and process for preparing said compounds α ethynyl and α vinyl 3,4 disubstituted pheynylalanines and esters thereof, have been prepared by reaction of methyl 3,4 dihydroxybenzoate with diphenyldichloromethane, reduction of the so obtained methyl 3,4 diphenylmethylene dioxy benzoate to 3,4 diphenylmethylenedioxybenzyl alcohol, and transforming this to the benzylchloride. This 3,4 diphenylmethylenedioxybenzylchloride reacts with 1 trimethyl silyl N benzylidene 3 aminoprop 1 yne to form 3 3,4 diphenylmethylenedioxybenzyl 1 trimethysilyl N benzylidene 3 aminoprop 1 yne. With methyl chloroformate this compound gives 3 carbomethoxy 3 3, 4 diphenylmethylenedioxybenzyl 1 trimethylsilyl N benzylidene 3 aminoprop 1 yne. The benzylidene group, the trimethylsilyl group and the diphenyl methylene group are removed, which results in the formation of α ethynyl 3,4 dihydroxy phenylalanine. The α vinyl analog is obtained by hydrogenation of an intermediate. The compounds have a pharmaceutical activity.
