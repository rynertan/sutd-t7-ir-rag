# Coke oven patching and sealing material, method of patching and sealing cracks in coke ovens.

## Abstract
A patching and sealing composition able to develop a superior bond with the silica refractories of a coke oven at temperature of 649 to 1316 C comprises three basic compo nents 1 a high melting phase, such as silica brick, fireclay grog, magnesia or high alumina grain, 2 a bonding compo nent, such as sodium silicate and 3 a low melting phase, such as window glass. It will generally be desirable to employ a fourth component for fluxing, such as soda ash or other alkaline earth compounds. The improved results are achieved by the use primarily, of a low melting phase such as window glass, bulb glass or lead glass having a softening point of 482 to 954 C employed in an amount of 6 to 25 of the total solids composition.
