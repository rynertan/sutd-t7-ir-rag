# Catalytic conversion of olefins to higher hydrocarbons.

## Abstract
An improved continuous process for converting lower olefinic hydrocarbon feedstock to C₅ liquid hydrocarbons by contacting vapor phase olefinic feedstream with acid zeolite catalyst in the presence of recycled diluent stream rich in C₃ C₄ hydrocarbons in an enclosed reactor at elevated temperature and pressure. The improved technique comprises a system for cool ing reactor effluent to recover a heavier hydrocarbon stream containing a mixture of C₃ C₄ hydrocarbons and C₅ hydrocar bons and debutanizing the heavier hydrocarbons below reactor pressure to obtain a C₅ product stream and a condensed C₃ C₄ hydrocarbon steam. Operating efficiencies are realized in the heat exchange system by reboiling the debutanized C₅ hyd rocarbon product stream by heat exchange with hot reactor effluent, and by recycling and combining at least a portion of the condensed C₃ C₄ hydrocarbon stream to dilute the liquid olefin hydrocarbon feedstock. By increasing pressure on the liquid olefinic hydrocarbon feedstock and liquid recycle stream to at least the elevated reactor pressure in the liquid state prior to vaporization, energy is conserved. An apparatus arrangement for conducting such a process is also disclosed.
