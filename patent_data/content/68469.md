# Refining copper bearing material contaminated with nickel, antimony and or tin.

## Abstract
In a copper refinery including smelting, converting and electrolytic refining steps, feed material containing copper and contaminated with iron and one or more impurity metals selected from the group consisting of nickel, antimony, and tin is refined in a process in which the impurity metals are separated from the copper prior to the main electrolytic refining step, into a converter slag product that is subsequently smelted to form an odes which are electrolyzed in a portion of the main copper refinery electrolyte. In another embodiment, oxidic e.g. roasted copper and copper nickel concentrates are individually smelted to form anodes which are electrolyzed in separate cells between which electrolyte is cycled to maintain a balance of dissolved copper.
