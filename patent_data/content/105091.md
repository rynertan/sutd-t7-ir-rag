# A tool length changing device in a panel forming machine.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a forming machine which is composed of several types of split dies in an upper die, thereby altering the length of the upper die in combination of the split dies. The upper die assembly has an upper die body mounted on the lower end of a ram, a number of upper split dies slidably inserted laterally of the die in the lower portion of the upper die body, a number of upper thin dies inversely mounted at the center of the upper split die group, a select finger driving mechanism provided at the front of the upper die body to slide the upper split dies in the lateral direction of the die, and an inverting mechanism provided at the rear of the upper die body to invert the upper thin dies of the desired number. The predetermined length of the die can be adjusted by driving the finger in response to the bending width of a work.
