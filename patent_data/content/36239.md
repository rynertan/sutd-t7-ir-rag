# A device for spreading of radar chaff.

## Abstract
A device for spreading of radar chaff from airplanes is described. The device comprises a magazine 29 for said chaff which by means of a motor operated displacement member may be displaced towards an ejection opening 30 . The device comprises a cover 21 having attachment means 22 by which the cover may be applied on the airplane in an existent beam position for hanging of weapons or other equipment. The cover is also provided with attachment means 24 and in connection to said attachment means cou pling members 23 and contact members 27 , respectively, are provided, said contact members being connected to some of said coupling members via transfer means 28 . The device may be used for a mechanical, electrical or a different adap tion between the airplane and equipment or weapons which may be carried by the same and may for example have the shape of a missile launch for firing of hunting missiles. Thereby is obtained the advantage that it is not necessary to use a beam position for carrying a unit for spreading of chaff only. As a consequence an airplane may carry a number of symmetrically suspended spreading devices according to the invention, and thereby a high chaff spreading capacity and an effective use of the chaff may be obtained without influencing notably the weapon carrying ability, weight or aerodynamic features of the airplane. If desireable an airplane may always carry one or more spreading devices according to the inven tion.
