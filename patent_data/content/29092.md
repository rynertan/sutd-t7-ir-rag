As a result of a long term study on the production of S 4 hydroxy 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en l one of the formula I , the inventors found a novel and very advantageous method for producing the compound of the formula I . The inventors made a further study on the important intermediate for this method and production thereof, and attained to the present invention. Next, the method of the present invention will be illustrated specifically. Production of S 4 hydroxy 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en l one of the formula I In applying solvolysis to cis lR, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 4S 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en 1 on 4 yloxyhydroxymethylcyclopropanecarboxylic lactone of the formula II , when the solvolysis is carried out in an alkaline condition pH not more than 12 , it proceeds in the form of the hydrolysis of the lactone ring, and the common mild hydrolysis conditions may be applied thereto.That is, the hydrolysis is carried out by reacting the lactone with a compound of the formula III R1OH at 0 to 500C while controlling the pH of the reaction system so as not to exceed 12 using an inorganic base e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, calcium carbonate . The amount of the compound III used for reaction is equivalent or more to cis lR, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 4S 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en 1 on 4 yloxyhydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone. In the present invention, however, acid solvolysis pH not more than 5 is more desirable, and in this case, the solvolysis is easily achieved by reacting the lactone with the compound of the formula III R1OH in a solvent at from room temperature e.g. 2000 to the boiling point of the solvent for 0.5 to 4 hours in the presence of a catalytic amount of acidic catalyst The solvent includes water, a C1 C4 alcohol itself of the formula III and mixtures thereof. The acidic catalyst includes for example organic acids e.g. oxalic acid, formic acid, halogenated acetic acids e.g.trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid , organic sulfonic acids e.g. p toluenesulfonic acid , mineral acids e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid and hydrogensulfates e.g. potassium hydrogensulfate . The amount of the compound III used for reaction is equivalent or more to cis 1R, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 4S 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en 1 on 4 yloxyhydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone. After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution is cooled to room temperature e.g. 200C or to less than that to 100C and neutralized, for example, with an aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution. Thereafter, the solution is extracted, after concentrated or as it is, with an inert solvent, and the extract is concentrated or, if necessary, distilled to obtain the objective S 4 hydroxy 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en 1 one of the formula I . The inert solvent includes for example hydrocarbon solvents e.g. benzene, toluene, n hexane, n heptane , halogenated hydrocarbon solvents e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride , ether solvents e.g. diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and ester solvents e.g. ethyl acetate .In the solvolysis with C1 C4 alcohols, cis lR, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 C1 C4 al alkoxyhydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone is recovered, and in the solvolysis with water, cis lR, 2S 3, 3 dimethyl 3 dihydroxymethyl cyclopropane carboxylic lactone is recovered. Production of cis lR, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 4S 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en l on 4 yloxyhydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone of the formula II One mole of racemic RS 4 hydroxy 3 methyl2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en l one which may contain the optically active isomer in part is allowed to react with 0.5 to 1.5 moles of cis lR, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 dihydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone or cis 1R, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 Cl C4 alkoxyhydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone without solvent or in an inert solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acidic catalyst. The inert solvent includes for example hydrocarbon solvents te.g. benzene, toluene, n hexane, n heptane , halogenated hydrocarbon solvents e.g.dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride , ether solvents e.g. diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and ester solvents e.g. ethyl acetate . These solvents may be used alone or in combination. The acidic catalyst includes for example organic acids e.g oxalic acid, formic acid, halogenated acetic acids e.g.trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid , organic sulfonic acids e.g. p toluenesulfonic acid , mineral acids e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid., phosphric acid, perchloric acid, nitric acid and hydrogensulfates e.g. potassium hydrogensulfate . This condensation is achieved by removing water or a C C alcohol of the formula V R20H produced as by product from the reaction system, for example, by distillation under reduced pressure by heating, by azeotropic distillation under atmospheric pressure, or by the use of dehydrating or alcohol removing agents such as molecular sieves.In the case of removal by azeotropic distillation, the condensation proceeds rapidly, coming to an end in 30 minutes to 4 hours in general, but it may be regarded as coming to an end at the time when the temperature of the distillate has reached the boiling point of the solvent azeotropic temperature when a mixed solvent is used . In the case of removal by molecular sieves, the condensation proceeds even in the vicinity of room temperature, and it comes to an end in 30 minutes to 24 hours in general, although the temperature and time depend also upon the amounts of the reagents. After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution is cooled to room temperature e.g. 200C or to less than that to 100C , neutralized with an aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate or sodium hydroxide solution or an amine, washed and concentrated to obtain cis lR, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 4S 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2 en l on 4 yloxyhydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone and its diastereoisomer as a stable mixture.This desired lactone can be isolated in a pure form by crystallizing from the mixture without solvent or from the foregoing inert organic solvent and separating the crystal from the mother liquor.

The mixture was placed in a still with a rectifying tower and heated. After removing water produced by the reaction as benzene water azeotropic mixture, the reaction was continued for further 30 minutes while distilling out benzene little by little. After cooling, the reaction solution was neutralized with a dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, washed and separated into organic and aqueous layers. The organic layer was concentrated to obtain 2.8 g of an oily product.The oily product was crystallized from a mixture of ether 1 ml and diisopropyl ether 10 ml . This crystal was separated from the mother liquor to obtain 0.7 g of cis lR, 2S 3,3 dimethyl 2 4S 3 methyl 2 2 propynyl cyclopent 2en 1 on 4 yloxyhydroxymethyl cyclopropanecarboxylic lactone.
