# SURFACTANTS FOR OIL WATER SYSTEMS IN WHICH THE HYDROPHILIC COMPONENT CONTAINS A SPECIFIED ANIONIC GROUPING

## Abstract
For use as surfactants in oil water systems, e.g hydraulic fluids, compounds are described which contain in the mol ecule a hydrophobic component and a hydrophilic compo nent covalently bonded together, where the hydrophobic component is a saturated or unsaturated C₃₀ ₅₀₀ hydrocarbon chain and the hydrophilic component contains an anionic grouping selected from phosphate, phosphonate, sulphate, sulphonate and carboxymethyl.
