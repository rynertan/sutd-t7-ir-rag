## Description
The present invention relates to a load carrying structural device. Wood beams are known since ancient times. They are cut with a rectangular cross section from one log of timber. The first real improvement of wood beams came in the 1920 s when beams were manufactured by horizontionally gluing together relatively slender boards of wood, called lamellae. These wood beams were also manufactured with a rectangular cross section and are referred to as laminated wood beams. They can easily be shaped to many different dimensions. A one pice wood beam can have relatively large faults which also may be hidden inside the beam. Because of their plurality of slender wood lamellae. Horizontally laminated beams have a high grade of homogeneous quality of materials and can carry allowable loads up to 40 higher than the old type one piece wood beams. In the 1960 s the laminated wood beams were also improved when lamells were longitudially fastened together by glued finger joints. The rectangular wood beams are very good load carrying structural elements in case if fires. Primary structures and roofs build with wood beams will retain their strength longer than a steel structure. At high temperatures the outside of the wood surface will slowly be charred more and more. This will act as an insolation against heat and also prevent the supply of oxygene. First at 300 500 The rectangular horizontally laminated wood beams have a favourable shape and can easily be manufactured in many dimentions up to very large beams. The production is very costefficient because the manufacturing processes are highly applicable to automatized high quantity production using specially designed machines for the purpose. The production of the rectangular laminated wood beams have increased tremenddously during the last 30 years and supplies practically the total demand in the market for wood beams. The laminated beams are also produced with vacuum impregnated wood lamellae. This provides the total volume of wood through out the whole beam, with an excellent protection against fungus and damages from insects. It is important to understand tht wood beams in building structures can only carry loads which will not bend the beam further down than the official specified maximum of allowable deflection. According to building laws this max allowable deflection is limited to approx. 1 360 1 400 of the length of the beam will vary in different countries . All rectangular wood beams will reach the max. deflection noticeable before fracture due to compression forces in the upper part, tension in the lower part or shear in the vertical middel section. Compared to the max. allowable load limited by deflection, a rectangular wood beam can carry up to 70 80 higher load before expected rupture. Due to the very limited and small allowable deflection, it is of vital importance that beams has a high degree of stiffness. To improve stiffness means that a beam can carry a higher load before the allowable deflection is reached. When calculating and designing beams, the demand for and specification of stiffness is the essential indication of the strength of the beams. Fracture will occur only at substantially higher load which will introduce a definately higher degree of deflection. As for all ordinary straight beams, the load bearing capacity also for a rectangular wood beam, depends on the capability to resist compression forces in the upper side and tension forces in the lower side, while the shear forces carried by the vertical web is relatively very small, because of the length the beams. This is relative to beams loaded in practical use, beeing bent with a downward deflection and having an upper concave curvature and a lower convex curvature. A stress diagram for a beam under loads shows max. compression at the upper surface. A straight line from this pint crosses the vertical center line in the middle and continues to max. tension at the lower surface. The shear forces are not shown in the stress diagram, and this diagram shows therefore that there are no forces in the center. The stress diagram can be compared to a drawing of the cross section of a rectangular beam and may indicate how the volume of wood is used to resist the forces which are introduced by the loads. The stress diagram shows that the compression stresses will be carried in the upper part and gradually increase from zero in the center and up to the highest stress at the upper surface. The tension stresses will be carried in the lower part of the beam and also gradually increase to the highest stress at the lower surface when the beam is in a loaded situation. Even if all of the volume of wood in reality is exposed to stresses, but only from zero in the center and then to the highest degree of stresses at the upper and lower surfaces, the stress diagram in a way will indicate that only 50 of the volume of wood is required if this volume is engaged as an efficient stress carrying structure. This is proved by the existing known I type wood beams shaped with a cross section like a steel beam, with flanges in the upper and lower part and only with a relative very thin vertical shear web in the middle. This I type wood beam in comparison to a rectangular wood beam of the same main dimensions will have only approximately 50 of the volume of wood, but is still capable of carrying the same load as the rectangular beam even when the allowable limited load is specified in relation to rupture. What has here been described in relation to the stressdiagram of a rectangular beam and the shape of the I type beams, proves that approx. 50 of the volume of wood in a rectangular wood beam is not required. Both types of beams are efficient under normal conditions when the load is limited by the specified maximum allowable degree of deflection. But in a fire the thin vertical shear web and possibly also the flanges in a I type beam, would rapidly be destroyed and not be able to maintain the total strength specified as allowable loads in relation to rupture. This strength must be maintained by a wood beam for a specified minimum time limit of 1 2 hour in a fire. The I type wood beams are therefore not approved for use in permanent primary building structures. In a fire a rectangular type wood beam will be capable of maintaining the required structure of wood long enough to satisfy the specified strength at rupture during the minimum time limit. What has been described with reference to the stressdiagram and the I type wood beams in relation to a rectangular wood beam, proves that approximately 50 of the volume of wood in the rectangular wood beams, is not required except in the case of a fire situation. Leaving out the situation of fire, the other approximately 50 of the volume of wood may be characterized as beeing unused , not utilized or not beeing engaged as an effecitive stress bearing structure. Regarding the state of the art, it is known from experience in the wood beam indystry, technical literature and patents, that a large number of attemts have been made by single persons, companies and technical organizations, in order to improve wood beams. As described above, I type wood beams have been produced with a relatively very thin vertical shear web. As mentioned, these beams are not approved for use in the building industry due to weakness in fires, and these beams are therefore only produced in both small quantities and sizes. Naturally this must be the reason why practically all other attempts to improve wood beams are based on beams with a rectangular cross section. Already in the 1930 s, the aircraft industry tested rectangular wood beams with installed aluminium plates on both the upper compression side and on the lower tension side. This seemed to be a general pattern up through years for improving wood beams. Instead of aluminium was steel mostly used in the form of plates, slender rods or even wires. Unlaminated or laminated wood beams were uses. The steel elements were fastened by mechanical means, glue or forced down in sections in the wood. When more and more steel was used, a beam became really more a steel beam than a wood beam and often failed more in shear than in compression or tension. The stressdiagram for these beams has the same shape as for an ordinary wood beam, and shows that the volume of wood was not used any better as an effective stress carrying structure, than was done in a regular wood beam. Some attempts were made mounting steel plates on the sides or wrapping the whole wood beam with fiberglass plastic. Other attempts included mounting steel members crosswise along the side of the wood beams and again trying to imitate steel structured beams. Some attempts also included fastening or gluing steel plates between the wood lamellae all through the beam. Further attempts for improvements were to install steel elements only in the lower tension side intending to strenghten the wood beams where they often fail due to the fact that wood is weaker in tension than in compression. When prestressing of other types of structures were known, attempts was also performed to prestress wood beams by bending different elements of wood and then fasten them together usually by glue. This could result in higher strength in compression and tension, but the stiffness would not increase. These beams were not able to carry a higher load than ordinary unstressed wood beams of the same dimensions. The formula for stiffness of beams clearly shows that in order to increace the stiffness of a beam the strength of a reinforcing element must have a higher strength E modul than the material in the original beam. Prestressing of concrete beams appear to have influenced the attempts to improve wood beams. Attempts to prestress wood beams have been performed exactly in the same manner as for concrete beams. To an unstressed straight beam, steel elements were fastened to the lower side tension side under loading by mechanical fasteners in each ends of the beam. Bolt mechanisms in the mechanical fasteners were used to introduce tension in the steel elements and in this manner prestress the beam. The German patent DE A 2 021 028 is a simular example for improving wood beams where the object is to prestress a laminated straight wood beam. This is described as done by bending the beam upwards in a press. Then a steel element is fastened to the lower concave side of the beam. The steel element can also be prestressed in tension by external machinery before the steel element is fastened to the beam. The effect of the steel element was supposed to retain the stresses in the wood beam after the beam was released from the press and thereby create a permanent prestressed wood beam. An asumption of how effective the results can be is rather uncertain. In any case, it would be difficult to control the technical parameters and attain a uniform quality in the production of the beams. The object of the invention was as described in the patent, to increase the strength in the lower part of the beam where tension stresses are introduced under loads in practical use, because wood material is weaker in tension than in compression. A stress diagram related to this beam will show that the neutral axis will be lowered. The steel element would most likely be exposed to nearly all the tension forces. All or nearly all the compression forces would be carried in all or nearly all of the beam, stresses beeing highest near the upper surface. This area seems to be the critical point where the compression stresses would be the limit for allowable maximum loads. The stress diagram will also show that a large part of the volume of wood is not engaged as an effective stress carrying structure. The ordinary rectangular wood beams with added installed steel reinforcements both in the upper and lower side and the beams with added steel reinforcement elements only in the lower side, did not seem to provide advantages which had any interest in the commercial markets. The I type wood beams are not approved for the use in permanent building constructions due to the danger of fire. The other attempts trying to improve wood beams seemed to a large extent to lack the proper understanding of technical theory related to the design and the use of wood beams, including official building laws. Many of the attempts to improve wood beams required costly equipment and the production processes were also complicated and not suitable to automated high volume production. The complicated production processes also made it difficult to control the technical factors involved and to produce quantities of beams with identical qualities capable of satisfy specified groups within official classifications. The technical literature indicates that all the attempts resulted in rather low grades of improved capabilities and also states that the added extra cost of production was to high relative to the small improvements attained. It is clearly expressed that this is one of the main reasons why these suggested, improved beams had no interests in the industry or in the commercial markets, and have not reached the production stage. A review in the technical litterature regarding Reinforcement of Wood Materials of 1983 and written by Professor William M. Bulleit, Michigan Technological University, describes most of the attempts for improving wood beams and the DE A 2 021 028 is also included. His conclusions are With the knowledge about the state of the art as here explained, the developments to improve wood beams seemed to have worked themselves up against an unbreakable wall. The inventor, however, still had ideas of how these beams could be improved to gain substantilly increased capabilities in a cost effective manner. One important element was the knowledge concerning the earlier described large volume of wood material in rectangular beams, approximatly 50 , which was not engaged as effective stress carrying structure, only necessary to protect the beam in a situation of fire. This unused wood material could be regarded as cost free. Significant improvements could definately be reached both in strength and cost effectiveness if this volume of wood material could be engaged and utilized as a highly stress effective structure in addition to its fire protection function. The object of the invention is to create a device for load carrying structure of laminated wood beams with a rectangular type cross section, with improved higher strength, being cost effective and engaging the largest part of the volume of wood as efficient stress carrying structure. The object, the nature of the invention, is to eliminate the drawbacks of said known beams, which is possible as defined by the following independent claims 1 and 2. Fig. 1, shows a rectangular laminated wood beam with added glued lamellae and installed reinforceing element while the beam is being in a press. Fig. 2, shows the same type beam where the reinforceing element is installed after the beam has been removed from the press. Fig. 3, shows a rectangular laminated wood beam prestressed in a press and where the reinforcement is installed at the same time. Fig. 4, shows different methods for fastening the reinforceing elements to wood beams. Fig. 5, shows an example of a beam with different curvatures. Fig. 6, shows a prestressed beam with the main reinforceing element mounted in the convex tension side and a relatively smaller element mounted in the opposite side. Fig. 7, shows a rectangular laminated wood beam being prestressed in a press. Lamellae are glued to the beam and a reinforceing element is mounted to the concave compression side. Fig. 1A, shows a rectangular laminated beam 6 being bent in a press. The beam 6 is curved with a convex upper side where tension prestresses are introduced and a lower convex side where compression stresses are introduced. These curvatures are opposite of the curvatures the beam will receive when being bent by heavy loads in practical use. A number of slender wood lamellae 7 are glued to the upper convex side of the beam 6, building up a new structure 8. A reinforceing element 4, for example of steel, is also installed in the upper convex side. It is of course essential that the new constructed beam comprising the beam 6, the lamella section 8 and the reinforceing element 4, must obtain a substantial higher stiffness. It is therefore proposed as an example that an element of steel is used. Both the lamellae 7 and the reinforceing element 4, is installed in unstressed conditions. The stress diagram shows this and that the beam 1 has introduced stresses of tension in the upper side and compression in the lower side. Fig. 1B, shows the new beam 9 after the beam has been removed from the press. When this happens the beam 9 tries to go back to its original form, but the lamella section 7 and the element 4, will almost totally hinder this. Due to this action compression stresses will be introduced into the lamella section 7 and the element 4, and the beam 9 will lose a relative very small part of its stresses in tension and compression. This is clearly shown in the stress diagram. The intensity of the stresses are also indicated. The pattern and intensity of the stresses in the stress diagram are definately calculated in order to achieve the best possible shape to withstand the stresses produced in the beam when this is heavily loaded in practical use, as shown in fig. 1C. When the loading stresses, compression in the upper side and tension in the lower side, react with and are added to the prestresses in the beam 9, the resulting stress diagram will be as shown in fig. 1C. Besides the increasing compression forces in the reinforceing element 4, the high intencity of the stresses in the wood part of the beam 9 proves that volme of wood material is engaged and utilized to a very high degree as a highly effective structure. Fig. 2 shows a beam and production processes very much like the beam described in fig. 1. The difference is that only the lammellae 7 are glued to the beam 6 when the beam is prestressed in the press as shown in fig. 2A. Only the lamella section 8 will hinder the beam to go back to its original form when the composite beam 9 comprising beam 6 and lamella section 8, is removed from the press. When the beam 9 is in its free state, as shown in fig. 2B, it is only a prestressed beam with no improved stiffness. It is in this situation the reinforceing element 4, for example of steel, is installed in the upper convex side as shown in fig. 2C. Fig. 2D, shows the beam 9 in a loaded situation. The reinforceing element 4 is installed unstressed and will not be prestressed either. Fig. 2D shows the beam 9 in a loaded situation. The reinforceing element 4 is now carrying compression stresses. The stress diagrams are otherwise much the same as in fig. 1. What is described regarding the prestresses and their effects is also valid for this beam in fig. 2. Fig. 3A, shows a rectangular laminated wood beam 10 being bent in a press receiving an upper convex side where tension stresses are introduced and a lower convex side where compression stresses are introduced. The reinforceing element 4, for example of steel, is installed in the upper convex tension side of the beam 10. The element 4 is installed in an unstressed condition. The stress diagram shows the prestresses only introduced into the beam 10. Fig. 3B, shows the composite beam 11 comprising the prestressed beam 10 and the reinforceing element 4, after the beam 11 is removed from the press. The neutral axis has now a higher location in beam 11 than in beam 10 due to the location of the high strength reinforceing element 4. This element hinders the beam 11 to go back to its original straight form, but the curvature will be slightly lesser. This action will also cause a slight release or loss of the stresses in the beam 11. This will change the stressdiagram in fig. 3B relative to the diagram in fig. 3A. compression stresses are introduced into the reinforceing element 4. Fig. 3C, shows the beam 11 in a loaded situation in practical use. Here the stress diagram is the result of the reaction or addition of the prestresses and the stresses due to the loading. Again, what has been expressed in fig. 1, regarding the dimensioning, intensions and results regarding the prestresses, is also valid for the beam in fig. 3. Fig. 4, shows possible methods for mounting reinforceing elements 4 to wood beams 12. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that reinforceing elements 4, for example of steel, can be mounted to wood beams 12 by the use of bolts 13 or screws or also by the use of glue. Fig. 4C and D, shows that the reinforceing elements 4 can be mounted to wood beams 12 by the use of glue 14. Fig. 4E and F, shows that the reinforceing elements 4 can be installed within the structure of wood in the beams 12. Fig. 5, shows an example for one of many possible geometric shaps of structural constructions. Due to the shape, different loads and supports, the stresses in tension or compression will vary over the length of such constructions. Fig. 6. The beam shown in this fig. and the steps in the manufacturing, is almost the same as may be understood from the description in fig. 1. In fig. 6, it is also shown the possibility for installing reinforceing elements in the lower section of prestressed wood beams. This fig. shows that the main reinforceing element 4 is installed in the upper convex side of the prestressed beam 15, while a smaller reinforceing element 16 with less strength, is installed in the lower concave side of the prestressed beam. Fig. 7A, shows a practical way to mount the reinforceing element 4 to the beam 1, before the beam 1 is prestressed, as clear from the stress diagram. The reinforceing element 4 has a longitudinal slender from and is mounted in an unstressed condition. The reinforceing element 4 is for example of steel, in order to increase the stiffness in a wood beam. It is pointed out that the reinforceing element 4 will not prestress the beam 1. This beam 1 must be prestressed by other forces, for example in a press. Fig. 7B, shows that the beam 1 is prestressed in a press and will be curved obtaining a concave side where compression stresses are introduced and an opposite convex side where tension stresses are introduced. The reinforceing element 4 is located in the concave side of the beam 1 where compression stresses are introduced. While the beam 1 is being prestressed in the press, a number of thin slender wood lamellae 2 are glued to the beam 1 on the convex side. The lamellae are not considered to be in any stresses due to the slight curvature of the beam 1. The stress diagram show the stresses as explained. It should also be noted that the installation of the reinforceing element 4 will be the reason why the neutral axis is moved up to a relatively high position in the beam 1. Fig. 7C, shows the beam 5 after it is removed from the press and is in a free unloaded situation. The beam 5 comprise the beam 1, the lamella section 3 and the reinforceing element 4. The stippled curved lines are shown to indicate the possibility of prestressing beams relative to the figure, upwards or downwards. The beam 1 was in this example bent downwards and therefore will the downward curved stippled line show that the upper side of the beam 5 will be concave and where compression stresses are introduced. The opposite lower side will be convex. After the beam 5 is removed from the press, the beam 1 will try to go back to its original straight form, but the glued lammella section 3 and the reinforceing element 4 will almost totally hinder this, and the beam 5 will attain an only slightly reduced curvature. This action will introduce compression stresses in the lamella section 3. The reinforceing element 4 will be effected by tension forces in this action. The final result of the stresses in the reinforcement element 4 will depend on when the element 4 was mounted in the steps of production and the joint effects of other factores. In this figures it is considered that the reinforceing element 4 has reduced compression stresses. The release of curvature of the beam 5 will result in slight reduced stresses in the beam 1 section. The stress diagram in fig. 7C, shows the stresses as explained. What is described regarding stress diagrams and their effects relative to the other figures, also corresponds to the situation in this figure 1. In the construction of the beam in this figure, the reinforceing element 4 can be installed in the concave compression side of beam 1 while the beam 1 is prestressed in the press or after the beam is removed from the press in the prestressed condition. The reinforceing element will be in an unstressed situation when mounted. Fig. 1D, shows the beam 5 carrying heavy loads in practical use. With the stress diagram it will clearly indicate if the reaction between the attained planned prestresses and the loading stresses will create an advantageous final stress diagram with a wanted pattern and good distribution of stresses with high intensity.
