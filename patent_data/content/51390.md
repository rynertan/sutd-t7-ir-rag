# Glass ceramic articles extremely resistant to impact and spontaneous delayed breakage and production thereof.

## Abstract
The present invention is concerned with glass ceramic articles which are extremely resistant to impact and spon taneous delayed breakage, are capable of being sawn with a diamond wheel to a depth of over one third the cross section thereof without breakage, and exhibit modulus of rupture values of at least 150,000 psi 10,500 kg cm² . The articles consist of a body portion and an integral surface compres sion layer having a depth of at least 0.005 0.0125 cm . The body portion consists essentially, in weight percent, of about 8 13 NA₂O, 7 13 K₂O, 30 36 Al₂O₃, 35 43 SiO₂, and 6 10 RO₂, wherein RO₂ consists of 6 10 TiO₂ and 0 4 ZrO₂, wherein the molar ratio Al₂O₃ SiO₂ is 0.5 but 0.6 and the molar ratio K₂O Na₂O is 1 3 but 1 and contains nepheline solid solution crystals corresponding to the formu la Na
