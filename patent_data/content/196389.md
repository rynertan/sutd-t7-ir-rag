# Optical waveguide fiber.

## Abstract
Optical fibers comprising core and or cladding elements composed of MgO Al₂O₃ SiO₂ glasses are described where in control of thermal expansion mismatch among the core and cladding elements is possible. Low stress, high numeric al aperture fibers as well as prestressed polarization relation and high strength fibers are described.
