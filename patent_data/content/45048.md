# High molecular weight piperidine derivatives as UV stabilizers.

## Abstract
Process for the selective reductive alkylation of a cyclic diamine by catalytic condensation of the cyclic diamine with a heterocyclic ketone. In the process described herein, the reaction conditions and catalyst which are selected are directive for the synthesis of the N,N substituted cyclic diamine. The compounds pro duced according to this procedure are readily isolated and are effective as UV stabilizers.
