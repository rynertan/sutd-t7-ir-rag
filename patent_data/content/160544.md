## Description
PROCESS FOR THE MANUE AC l URE OF CONJUGATED POLYENOIC FATTY COMPOUNDS The present invention relates to the manufacture of conjugated polyenoic including dienoic fatty compounds from corresponding non conjugated fatty compounds. Naturally occurring triglycerides fats and fatty oils , the free fatty acids of such fats and oils and the alkyl esters of these fatty acids contain non conjugated fatty compounds. The conjugated fatty acids or esters obtained from such non conjugated fatty compounds are useful in paints, varnishes, coatings and printing inks to which they impart improved properties, e.g. improved drying properties. Most hitherto reported isomerisation processes have been applied to the methyl esters of fatty acids derived from natural oils, e.g. methyl linoleate. However, very few of them work with natural poly unsaturated fats and oils. U.S. Patents 3,373,175 and 3,392,177 propose a method for the isolation of a conjugated drying oil by reaction of a vegetable oil with an excess of iron pentacarbonyl for 2 4 hours at 1850C, removal of the complex of the conjugated acid formed, and its decomposition with ferric chloride or carbon monoxide under pressure.However, stoichiometric amounts of iron pentacarbonyl are required in this process. In British Patent 1,408,189, French Patent 2,159,402 and Swiss Patent 578,044, the use of alcoholates of alkali and alkaline earth metals in a very polar aprotic solvent is proposed. The isomerization is carried out at temperature up to 1600C in the presence of 1 5 of the methylate or butylate of the metal in a solvent such as dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, or N methyl pyrrolidine. British Patent 590784 describes a catalytic process for conjugation of double bonds in fatty substances in the vapor phase at high temperatures. The catalysts used are amorphous silica, activated fulling clay and the silicates and oxides of all metals except the alkali and alkaline earth metals. German Patent 2,049,937 describes a process for catalytic Conjugation of double bonds in polyunsaturated higher carboxylic acids in the form of their esters with lower monovalent alcohols or the triglycerides but especially in the form of free carboxylic acids. The catalysts used are complexes of rhodium or ruthenium in combination with metallic chlorides or bromides. French Patent 8t430013.3 describes a process for catalytic conjugation of polyunsaturated fatty compounds in the liquid phase with ruthenium on charcoal at a temperature of 180 250 C in the presence of a protonic compound. The drawbacks of the prior art processes reside essentially in the extreme conditions of reaction and the impossibility of recovering the catalyst quantitatively at the end of the reaction without substantial loss in its activity. The present invention reduces or avoids this problem. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of a conjugated polyenoic fatty compound from a corresponding non conjugated fatty compound which comprises contacting a non conjugated polyunsaturated triglyceride, fatty acid or fatty acid ester with, as catalyst, a cationic complex of a transition metal of GroupVIII in the presence of a suitable solvent to produce the desired corresponding conjugated polyenoic fatty compound. The preferred metals of Group VIII are rhodium and iridium. The advantage of using rhodium and iridium catalysts over other homogeneous catalysts lies in the fact that it is possible to remove them at the end of the reaction by solvent extraction. Although it has been reported by Shrock, R. R.and J. A. Osborn, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 98, 2134 1976 ibid 98,2113 1976 ibid 98,4450 1976 that cationicRhodium I complexes of the type ligand RhL2 wherein L PPh3, 1,2 bisdiphenyl phosphinoethine, etc. are very active hydrogenation catalysts for fatty oils, their use in the present invention as conjugation catalysts is suprising because no attempt has ever been made before to employ them for this purpose. Likewise, Rhodium III, Iridium I and Iridium III complexes wherein the suffixes I and III refer to tne valencies of the metals may also be employed as the cationic catalytic complexes in the process of the present invention The catalytic complexes may be synthesised in a separate preparation step and then employed in the process of the present invention, or they may be generated in situ in the course of the action. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention a non conjugated polyunsaturated natural oil or the free fatty acid thereof or an alkyl ester of the acid, is heated, and normally refluxes, with a cationic catalyst complex of rhodium or iridium in an appropriate solvent, preferably in an atmosphere of inert gas. The isomerisation reaction is usually effected at temperatures of 500C to 16p C and at pressures from 1 to 10 atmospheres.The reaction time required can be gauged by taking periodic gas chromatographic samples of the product mixture and this reaction time saries depending on the specific catalyst used, the temperature of the reaction and the solvent employed. The solvent for the reaction is preferably a hydroxylic solvent which is an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol or cyclohexanol, a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane or chlorobenzene, or a polar inert solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile, or mixtures of any of these. The non conjugated triglycerides that may be isomerized by the process of the present invention include linseed oil, safflower oil, china wood oil, dehydrated castor oil soyabean oil, grape seed oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil and cotton seed oil. Also employable are esters ot the free acids of such triglycerides with lower aliphatic alcohols. Alternatively, the process may be applied to the free fatty acids of the fats and oils referred to. Examples of these acids are the polyunsaturated higher carboxylic acids such as linoleic acid, linolenic acid, linolaidic acid, and linolaidenic acid. These carboxylic acids may be employed in admixture with one another or with other saturated or mono olefinic higher carboxylic acids, e.g.fatty acids of natural origin such as linseed oil acids, safflower oil acids, soyabean oil acids, rapeseed oil acids, cottonseed oil acids or sunflower oil acids. Alternatively, the polyunsaturated higher carboxylic acids may be used in the form of their esters with lower monovalent alcohols. The catalytic complexes preferably employed in the process of the present invention can be dimeric complexes represented by one or other of the formulae Diene MCl 2 or Diene M acac 2 wherein M rhodium or iridium Diene 1,5 cyclooctadiene, norbornadiene NBD , 1,3 butadiene or 1,3 cyclohexadiene and acac acetyl acetone. In addition to the above mentioned dimeric complexes, other specific catalytic complexes which may be employed are identified hereafter by the respective formulae I to VIII.

R. and Osborn, J.A.,Journal of the American Chemical Society, 93,2397 1971 , and then employed as catalysts in the process of the present invention.Alternatively, they may be generated in situ in the reaction mixture from complexes of the Formula I by treatment with appropriate reagents. If desired, the catalytic complexes may be heterogenised by incorporating the phosphine ligand into a polymeric matrix such as polystyrene. Since the complexes are cationic in nature,. it is also possible to anchor these catalysts on cation exchange resins or zeolites which act as substrates. However, the effectiveness of the complexes as catalysts partly depends on the solubility of the substrate and the catalyst in the solvent used. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst can be recovered quantitatively by simple solvent extraction of the substrate. For this purpose, a non polar solvent such as pentane or hexane can be employed. The polar nature of the catalyst causes it to precipitate out on addition of the solvent and the catalyst can then be recovered in any known way and recycled for use again without any significant loss of its catalytic properties. The invention is described in greater detail in the following illustrative Examples. EXAMPLE 1 Safflower oil 10 parts was contacted with Rh NBD P C6H5 3 2 C104 0.1 part in a solvent mixture of acetone and methanol at 700C under a N2 atmosphere for 12 hours. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was isolated by solvent extraction with methanol. The isomerised oil which was separated was converted to its methyl ester by reaction with sodium methoxide. Analysis of this methyl ester by gas liquid chromatography showed 90 conversion of the linoleate present in the starting oil to its conjugated isomer. EXAMPLE 2 In a 100 ml flask fitted with a reflux condenser, 100 parts of soyabean acid methyl ester 54 linoleic acid methyl ester 28 oleic acid methyl ester 5 Linolenic acid methyl ester, 88 palmitic acid methyl ester 4 stearic acid methyl ester and the remaining C14 to C20 acid methyl ester were ref fluxed with 1 part of g Rh NBD P C6H5 3 2 j Cl04 in a 90 10 solvent mixture of acetone and methanol under a N2 atmosphere for 6 hours. At the end of the reaction, the solvent was removed under vacuum and the residue washed with pentane to remove the catalyst with precipitates. The mixture of fatty acid esters thus separated was analysed by gas liquid chromatography glc and showed 90 conjugation of the methyl linoleate present in the initial mixture. EXAMPLE 3 In a 100 ml flask fitted with a reflux condenser, 100 parts of safflower oil composition 77 linoleic acid, 14.5 oleic acid, 5.6 palmitic acid, 2.1 stearic acid, remaining C14 to C20 saturated acids were ref fluxed with 1 part of Rh NBD P C6H5 3 2 7 C104 in a 90 10 solvent mixture of acetone and methanol under a N2 atmosphere for 12 hours. At the end of the reaction, the solvent was removed and the catalyst precipitated from the oil by addition of pentane. The catalyst was isolated by filtration and isomerised oil was obtained by removing pentane from the filtrate. The isomerised oil was analysed by glc after conversion to its methyl ester. Preparation of methyl ester 1 ml of isomerised oil was dissolved in 10 ml of dry methanol and 3 mg of sodium was added. The solution was ref fluxed under N2 for 30 minutes. The solution at the end of the reaction was homogeneous and on analysis by gic showed 90 conversion of the linoleate present in the starting oil to its conjugated isomer. The catalyst isolated from the above reaction was mixed again with 100 parts of safflower oil in a 90 10 acetone methanol solvent mixture and refluxed under N2 for 12 hours. The isomerised oil that was isolated at the end of the reaction by the same procedure as above showed 87 conjugation of the linoleate present in the starting oil on analysis of its methyl ester by glc. The catalyst was recycled once again exactly as above and yielded an isomerised oil with 82 conjugation of starting linoleate. EXAMPLE 4 100 parts of safflower acid composition conforming to safflower oil used in example 3 were ref fluxed with 1 part of Rh EtOH 2 PPh3 2H2 7C104 in a 80 20 CHC13 EtOH mixture under N2 for 12 hours. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was isolated as in the previous example. The isomerised acid was converted to its methyl ester by ref fluxing with 0.5 H SO in CH3OH and analysed by glc which indicated 70 conjugation of the linoleic acid present in the starting mixture. EXAMPLE 5 100 parts of Linseed oil composition 51 Linolenic acid, 17 linoleic acid, 22 oleic acid, the remaining saturated C16 C24 acids were ref fluxed with 1 part of r Ir NBD PPh3 2jC104 in a 90 10 CH2C12 MeOH mixture under N2 for 12 hours. At the end of the reaction, the catalyst was isolated as in Example 2. The isomerised oil after conversion to its methyl ester as in Example 2 showed 52 of conjugated dienes and 12 conjugated trienes on glc analysis. EXAMPLE 6 100 parts of linseed oil fatty acid with the same composition as the linseed oil of Example 5 were ref fluxed with 1 part of g Rh NBD Diphos gC104 in a 90 10 CH2Cl2 MeOH mixture for 12 hours under N2. The product mixture after removal of catalyst was converted to the methyl ester with 0.1 H2SO4 in CH3OH. GLC analysis showed 56 of conjugated diene and 6 conjugated triene. EXAMPLE 7 Safflower oil methyl ester having the same composition as the safflower oil of Example 3 was isomerised with D Rh H2 PPh2cy 2 acetone 2 7PF6 that was generated in situ.For this purpose, 1 part of t RH PPh2cy 2 NBD 7 PF6 cy cyclohenyl, C6H11 and Ph C6H5 in acetone was first treated with H2 for 10 minutes at room temperature. At the end of this period, H2 was replaced by N2, 100 parts of safflower oil methyl ester were added and the mixture ref fluxed under N2 for 5 hours. GLC analysis at the end of the reaction after isolation of the catalyst indicated 90 conjugation of the methyl linoleate present in the starting mixture. By the process of the present invention, it is possible to bring about isomerisation within a carbon chain to form a conjugated structure. The process possesses the particular advantage in that by employing the catalyst system described, it is possible to conjugate directly naturally occuring triglycerides. Earlier catalytic systems were known to catalyse the isomerisation of fatty acid esters of lower aliphatic alcohols but failed in attempts to isomerise natural triglycerides. Over and above this, the process also possesses the added advantage of making it possible readily to recover the catalyst from the reaction mixture at the end of the isomerisation reaction.
