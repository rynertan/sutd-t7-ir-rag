# Wide aperture objective lens.

## Abstract
An objective lens comprising five lens elements and intended for use in an optical recording system wherein a laser beam is focused onto a recording surface located beneath a plastic layer over the disc. The disclosed lens has a relatively large numeric aperture of 0.75, but has a relatively large working distance between the lens and the disc and a relatively low total mass, to facilitate rapid movement of the lens. In addition, the lens is color corrected to accommodate a range of spectral frequencies present in the laser beam.
