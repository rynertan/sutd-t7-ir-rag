# A semiconductor laser.

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser, which comprises a first cladding layer 2 of first conductivity type provided on a semiconductor substrate 1 of first conductivity type a current blocking layer 3 second conductivity type provided on the cladding layer having a stripe groove 10 from which the first cladding layer 2 is exposed at the bottom thereof a light guide layer 4 of first conductivity type provided covering the current blocking layer 3 , the stripe groove 10 , and the first cladding layer 2 exposed from the groove an active layer 5 provided on the light guide layer 4 curved in the neighbourhood of the stripe groove 10 , whose refractive index is larger than that of the light guide layer 4 and a second cladding layer 6 of second conductivity type provided on the active layer 5 , whose re fractive index is smaller than that of the active layer 5 .
