# Method and apparatus for indicating the dynamic instability of railway or tramway rolling stock.

## Abstract
A method is described for indicating the dynamic instabil ity of railway or tramway rolling stock. The method essentially consists in detecting, by means of at least one accelerometer sensor 11 , the acceleration of the wheel arrangement of the rolling stock in a direction transverse the direction of travel, suitably processing it and subsequently comparing, in a suit able comparator 15, 16 , the processed acceleration value with a reference value Vâ‚€. The indication of instability is ob tained by checking whether the number of processed acceler ation values which exceed the said reference value is greater than a predetermined number in a predetermined period of time.
