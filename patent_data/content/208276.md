## Description
The present invention relates to an optical measuring device for optically measuring the surface configuration of an object to be measured comprising a light beam radiating means which radiates a measuring beam composed of rays substantially parallel to the optical axis of said measuring beam, an objective lens which condenses the incident rays of said measuring beam on the surface of the object to be measured which is relatively movable with respect to said measuring beam in a plane, first photodetector means which receives a part of the reflected rays of said measuring beam which have been reflected by the surface of said object to be measured and have been passed back through said objective lens to thereby detect a deviation of the optical path of the reflected rays from the optical path of the incident rays and output a signal indicative of the deviation, second photodetector means which receives at least a part of said reflected rays to thereby detect a displacement of said surface of the object to be measured, and inclination correcting means including driving means which moves the optical path of the incident rays in the direction normal to the optical axis of said objective lens in correspondence with said signal. An optical measuring device of this type may e.g. be used for optically measuring the surface configuration of such objects as a lens or a mirror which have a spherical surface and of objects with any kind of arbitrarily curved surface. The optical measuring device may be in the form of a laser gauge interferometer employing the optical heterodyning technique, a laser interferometer of the Mach Zehnder interferometer type or the like and thereby conducts the optical measurement with high precision and without making direct contact with the object surfaces. For the measurement of the surface configuration the Doppler shift of the reflected rays caused by the movement of the incident rays re lative to the object to be measured may be used. A known optical measuring device of the above referenced type Japanese patent laid open No. 59 79104 corres. to US Patent 4,611,916 which has been proposed by the present applicant radiates a laser beam directly onto the object to be measured, thereby measuring the surface configuration of the object by the laser interferometric measuring method in accordance with the optical heterodyning technique. More specifically ... the proposed measuring device comprises means for radiating a measuring beam modulated by a predetermined frequency and for condensing the measuring beam on the surface of an object to be measured through an objective lens, focus servo means for maintaining the distance between the objective lens and the surface of the object to be measured at a constant value, an inclination correcting servo means operable to move the objective lens or the ray axis of incident rays of the measuring beam in a direction which is normal to the optical axis of the objective lens such that the incident rays of the measuring beam and reflected rays thereof can follow substantially the same optical path, i.e. they can substantially overlap each other along their optical paths, and means for moving the object to be measured at a constant speed. Thus, the proposed device radiates a measuring laser beam toward an object to be measured without the intermediary of a measuring probe, and detects the Doppler shift of reflected rays of the measuring laser beam, thereby measuring the surface configuration of the object to be measured by the optical heterodyning technique. Fig. l shows the arrangement of the proposed device as a conventional device, wherein arrows X, Y and Z represent X Y Z orthogonal coordinates. A beam having a frequency Fl and a frequency F2 is radiated from an He Ne Zeeman frequency stabilizing laser not shown , and is separated into two bundles of rays by a half mirror 27. The difference between the frequencies Fl and F2 is on the order of several hundred KHz to several MHz. The two bundles of rays have the planes of polarization thereof normal to each other. Parts of the separated rays are used for detection of the X Y components on the X Y coordinates, as hereinafter explained, while the rest of the rays are used for detection of the Z component on the Z coordinate as described hereinunder. After transmission through the half mirror 27, the rays are split into the measuring rays having the modulation frequency Fl and the reference rays having the modulation frequency F2 by a polarizing prism l2. The measuring rays are focused on the surface of an object l to be measured by an objective lens 2 through a polarizing prism ll, a quarter wavelength plate 7a and a mirror l5a. On the other hand, the reference rays are irradiated on a reference mirror l6 mounted on a movable table A together with the object l to be measured through a quater wavelength plate 7b, a lens l3, and mirrors l5b and l5c. The table A on which the object l is mounted is movable in the directions of X and Y along a plane defined by the X Y coordinates. When the table A is moved along the X Y plane, there occurs a change in the thickness of the object l to be measured, i.e., in the Z component of the measuring spot on the surface of the object l, causing a corresponding change in the length of the optical path of the measuring rays. Thus, the reflected rays of the measuring rays have a frequency Fl Δ which is different from that Fl of the measuring ray by a differential frequency Δ due to the Doppler shift. The reflected rays of the measuring rays are inputted to a photodetector l8 through the objective lens 2, mirror l5a, quater wavelength plate 7a, and polarizing prisms ll and l2. Meanwhile, the reference rays are reflected by the highly accurate reference mirror l6 having a profile irregularity of less than l0 nm. The reflected rays of the reference rays, however, have a frequency F2 δ which is different from that F2 of the reference rays by a differential frequency δ depending upon the Doppler shift and corresponding to an error in the straightness of movement of the table A from the X Y plane, which is normal to the Z coordinate. The reflected rays of the reference rays are inputted to the photodetector l8 through the mirrors l5c, l5b, lens l3, quater wavelength plate 7b and polarizing prism l2. The reflected rays of the measuring rays and the reflected rays of the reference rays are synthesized by the polarizing prism l2, and the difference Fl Δ F2 δ between the frequencies of them is detected by the photodetector l8 as a beat signal. The frequency of the beat signal is detected by a detecting circuit l9, to thereby obtain an accurate measurement value of the Z component indicating the thickness of the object l. On the other hand, the X Y components of the measuring spot are measured in a similar manner by detecting the positional difference between a mirror 22 arranged on the side of the objective lens 2 and a mirror 2l mounted on the movable table A integrally with the object l, on account of rays having the Fl and F2 frequencies, which are reflected by the half mirror 27. More specifically, the measuring rays having the frequency Fl are transmitted to the mirror 22 through a mirror l5, a polarizing prism 23, and a quarter wavelength plate 7c and are reflected by the mirror 22. Then, the reflected rays of the measuring rays are again transmitted from the mirror 22 through the quarter wavelength plate 7c, polarizing prism 23, a corner cube 24, the polarizing prism 23 and quater wavelength plate 7c, and again reflected by the mirror 22 finally reaching a photodetector 25 through the quarter wavelength plate 7c and polarizing prism 23. On the other hand, the reference rays having the modulation frequency F2 are transmitted to the mirror 2l through the mirror l5, polarizing prism 23, a quarter wavelength plate 7d and a mirror l5d, and reflected by the mirror 2l. Then, the reference rays which have been reflected by the mirror 2l, are transmitted through the mirror l5d, quarter wavelength plate 7d, polarizing prism 23, corner cube 24, polarizing prism 23, quarter wavelength plate 7d and mirror l5d, and are again reflected, finally reaching the photodetector 25 through the mirror l5d, quarter wavelength plate 7d, and polarizing prism 23. When the measuring rays and the reference rays are reflected by the mirrors 22 and 2l, respectively, Doppler shifts are caused by the movements of the objective lens 2 and the movable table A, respectively. The photodetector 25 detects the difference between the frequencies of the reflected rays of the measuring rays and the reference rays as a beat signal. A detecting circuit 26 calculates the X Y components of the measuring spot from the frequency value of the beat signal. The conventional device described as above is adapted such that when the surface of the object to be measured is inclined the objective lens 2 or the optical path of the incident rays of the measuring rays is moved in a direction which is normal to the optical axis of the objective lens, thereby making it possible for the incident rays and the rays of the measuring rays which are reflected to follow substantially the same optical paths. However, if the objective lens is moved by a driving means 20, the measuring spot is also moved in correspondence with the movement of the objective lens. On the other hand, if the optical path of the incident rays is moved in a direction which is normal to the optical axis of the objective lens by moving the mirror l5a, it happens, in general, that the length of the optical path of the incident rays is correspondingly changed. Such a change in the length of the optical path is undesirable because the optical path length per se constitutes the relevant measurement data. In order to correct the change in the length of the optical path, the latter has to be measured with as high precision as required for measuring the object, this being rather difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the movement of the objective lens 2 can be measured with a high degree of precision. To this end, a laser beam may be radiated on the mirror 22 Fig. l arranged on the side of the objective lens. However, even if the X Y components of the measuring spot can be detected with high precision by thus measuring the movement of the objective lens 2, there is still a need to compensate for the movement of the measuring spot from its originally intended position. To this end, however, it is impossible to bring the measuring spot from its actual position to the originally intended position in an open loop manner because the measuring spot which is located on the optical axis of the objective lens always moves in correspondence with the movement of the objective lens which in turn moves in accordance with the inclination of the surface of the object to be measured. Instead, the measuring spot has to be brought back from its actual position to the originally intended position in a feedback manner by a focus servo means which operates to minimize the difference between the actual and intended positions of the measuring spot. Thus, the problem of how to compensate for the movement of the measuring spot which is caused by the inclination of the surface of the object to be measured is something which needs to be solved before it will be possible to improve the measuring precision and to develop various functions of the measuring device. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an optical measuring device which is capable of properly changing the radiation angle of the measuring beam in accordance with the inclination of the object to be measured with a higher degree of precision of the measurement. To this end the invention is characterized in that said inclination correcting means moves the optical path of the incident rays without causing any deviation in the length of the optical path of the measuring beam so as to maintain the optical path of the reflected rays unchanged irrespective of the inclination of the surface of said object to be measured, thereby to eliminate said deviation of the reflected rays. In accordance with the invention the radiation angle of the measuring beam is thereby changed without causing any change in the length of the optical path of the incident rays of the measuring beam and of the reflected rays thereof. Thereby the surface configuration of the object may be measured to a high precision by detecting the Doppler shift of the reflected rays of the measuring beam. In more detail, the optical measuring device comprises beam radiating ... means which radiates a measuring beam composed of rays substantially parallel to the optical axis of the measuring beam, an objective lens which condenses the incident rays of the measuring beam on the surface of an object to be measured which is relatively movable with respect to the measuring beam along a plane, first photodetector means such as, for example, a quater sectioned detector which receives a part of the reflected rays of the measuring beam which have been reflected by the surface of the object to be measured, and outputs an error signal, and correcting means which moves the optical path of the incident rays in the direction normal to the optical axis of the objective lens in correspondence with the signal, while the lengths of the optical paths of the incident and reflected rays are left to be unchanged. According to one aspect of the invention, the inclination change correcting means comprises a beam splitter through which rays of the measuring beam are transmitted before incidence of the rays upon the objective lens, a condenser lens which condenses the rays of the measuring beam which have been transmitted through the beam splitter, to a mirror which reflects the rays of the measuring beam that is then reflected by the beam splitter. Thereby the incident rays of the measuring beam can be subjected to parallel displacement so as not to cause the lengths of the optical paths of the incident and reflected rays to vary. By virtue of the provision of the above mentioned means for use with the optical measuring device according to the present invention, the measuring beam composed of rays substantially parallel with the optical axis of the measuring beam, which is made incident on the surface of the object to be measured by the objective lens can be moved in a direction normal to the optical axis of the objective lens, and thus no change takes place in the optical path length of the measuring beam, thereby preventing errors in measurement of the Z component of the measuring spot even if the inclination of the object to be measured changes. Further, the incident rays of the measuring beam can be made incident on the objective lens in a direction parallel to the optical axis of the objective lens, so that no change takes place in the light condensed position by the objective lens, thus preventing errors in measurement of the X Y components of the measuring spot even with a change in the inclination of the object to be measured.

Fig. 2 shows the optical system of a first embodiment of the optical measuring device according to the invention. In the embodiments, the measurement of the X Y components of the measuring spot may be conducted in a similar manner to that described hereinbefore in relation to the conventional device. Therefore, illustration of the part of the system for measuring the X Y components is omitted from Figs. 2 to 5, also omitted is a specific description of that part of the system from the following. A frequency stabilizing He Ne Zeeman laser not shown radiates a laser beam composed of rays whose planes of polarization are normal to each other, and which have frequencies Fl and F2. A half mirror not shown separates a part of the rays for measuring the X Y components of the measuring spot in the same way as in the conventional device of Fig. l. The rays having the frequencies Fl and F2, are split by a polarizing prism l2 which acts as a beam splitter into a bundle of rays of modulation frequency Fl and another bundle of rays of modulation frequency F2, which will be referred to respectively as measuring rays and reference rays . The plane of polarization of the measuring rays Fl is rotated through 45 degrees by a Faraday element 9 provided with a magnet l0, after they are transmitted through a special polarizing prism ll. The plane of polarization of the measuring rays is then rotated through 45 degrees by a half wavelength plate 8, and therefor the measuring rays have P polarized waves which can be totally transmitted through a polarizing prism 3. The measuring rays are then condensed on a mirror 5 through a quater wavelength plate 7a and a condenser lens 4. The part of the measuring rays Fl reflected by the mirror 5 are turned into S polarized waves by the quater wavelength plate 7a, and then, after being totally reflected by the polarizing prism 3, the reflected rays are made incident on an objective lens 2, and are focused thereby onto the surface of an object l to be measured. The objective lens 2 is driven by a coil l7 constituting a focus servo loop, to focus always the measuring light rays onto the surface of the object l to be measured, that is, the lens 2 is driven in the direction of Z, i.e., in the direction parallel with the ray axis of the measuring rays, and is subjected to a focus servo control. As a method for detecting an error signal of the focus servo means, a method comprising the step of detecting the error signal from the measuring rays reflected from the surface of the object to be measured, as disclosed in the above mentioned Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 59 79l04 corresponding to U. S. Patent Application No. 609,l96 may be employed but details thereof are omitted due to a duplication. In addition, there is a method as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 59 228ll4 which may be employed that comprises the step of mixing a semiconductor laser beam with the measuring rays of the He Ne laser beam with the use of a dichroic mirror in such a manner that the optical paths of the beams overlap each other, so as to obtain the error signal of the focus servo means by the semiconductor laser beam. In Fig. 2, although the incident rays are shown as a single straight line, the incident rays are actually a bundle of rays having a diameter of about 2 mm, which are irradiated onto the surface to be measured after being focused by the objective lens 2 into a spot of a diameter of about 2 to 3 µm. The effective aperture of the objective lens 2 is 4.3 mm. The rays reflected by the object l to be measured have a frequency Fl Δ which is changed from the modulation frequency Fl of the incident rays due to the Doppler shift caused by the movement of the object l to be measured along the plane defined by the X Y coordinates and by the surface configuration of the object to be measured l. The reflected rays follow exactly the same optical path as the incident rays, but in the reverse direction, i.e. they return to the polarizing prism 3 through the objective lens 2, polarizing prism 3, quater wavelength plate 7a, condenser lens 4, mirror 5, condenser lens 4, and quater wavelength plate 7a. Thereafter, the reflected rays are turned into S polarized waves by the half wavelength plate 8 and the Faraday element 9. A part of the reflected rays is then reflected by the special polarizing prism ll, while the rest of the rays are totally reflected by the polarizing prism l2, and then reach a photodetector l8. However, if a change occurs in the inclination of the surface of the object l, the reflected rays tend to follow an optical path which deviates from the optical path of the incident rays in accordance with the inclination change. Therefore, according to the invention, the device is provided with inclination change correcting means which operates in such a way that any deviation of the optical path of the reflected rays from that of the incident rays is detected by a condenser lens l3 and a quater sectioned photodetector l4 which refer to the part of the reflected rays which have been separated by the special polarizing prism ll, and the position at which the incident rays are incident on the objective lens 2 is corrected by moving the condenser lens 4 which is driven by a condenser lens driving circuit 6 along a plane defined by the Y Z coordinates, i.e., in a direction normal to the optical path of the measuring rays incident on the condenser lens 4. As a result, the optical path of the rays incident on the objective lens 2 is moved as appropriate in a direction normal to the optical axis of the objective lens 2, thereby controlling the optical path of the reflected measuring rays so that they reflect back along the same optical path as the incident rays thereof. The following gives the reasons why no change in the optical path length, and therefore no measurement errors are caused in accordance with the invention. Assume that both the condenser lens 4 and the objective lens 2 have no aberration. Then, when measuring rays which are parallel to the optical axis of the condenser lens 4 are incident on the condenser lens 4 at any position thereon, they can be all focused onto the optical axis of the lens 4 without causing any change in the optical path lengths. Further, if the condenser lens 4 is moved along the Y Z plane, its focal point i.e. the condensing position also moves correspondingly on the reflection surface of the mirror 5. In this case, however, if the reflection surface of the mirror 5 is located on the Y Z plane and if the reflection surface has a high degree of flatness, no substantial variation will be appreciated in the optical path length. Furthermore, the orientation of the reflection surface of the polarizing prism 3 at 45 with respect to the optical path helps to maintain the entire optical path length of the rays reflected by the object l to be measured to be unchanged. Therefore, only limited factors can cause a change in the optical path length, such as degrees of aberration of the condenser lens 4 and the objective lens 2, and the degree of flatness of the mirror 5. Changes in the optical path length caused by these factors can be reduced to a level of not more than 40 nm without difficulty. In the optical system shown in Fig. 2, the object to be measured l and a reference mirror l6 are secured on a fixed table B, while the rest of the elements of the system are mounted on the X Y movable table A, and further the objective lens 2 can be moved in the direction of Z by the focus coil l7. When the error signal of the focus servo means is to be obtained by a semiconductor laser, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 59 228ll4, an error signal detecting optical system, not shown, including the semiconductor laser is arranged in such a manner that it can be moved integrally with the objective lens 2 in the Z direction. As the measuring spot is moved from one position to another on the surface of the object l to be measured, the frequency of the reflected rays is shifted to a value of Fl Δ due to the Doppler shift in response to the speed with which the Z component of the measuring spot changes. Meanwhile, the reference rays F2 are focused onto the reference mirror l6 through the quater wavelength plate 7b, the condenser lens l3, and mirrors l5b, l5c, after they have been split by the polarizing prism l2. The reference rays reflected by the mirror l6 are inputted to the photodetector l8 after following the same optical path as that described above, but in the reverse direction. By the operation of the above inclination change correcting means, the reflected measuring rays and reference rays can always be overlapped each other on the photodetector l8 to cause interference with each other, thereby generating a beat signal having a frequency of Fl Δ F2 δ . The photodetector l8 has a polarizing plate for aligning the polarization directions of the reflected measuring rays and reference rays. The Z component of the measuring spot can then be obtained by calculating the value of Fl Δ F2 δ of the beat signal. In the above optical system, the X Y movable table which is movable along the X Y plane even with a highest degree of accuracy can be moved with a straightness of at most l00 nm. However, the degree of flatness of the mirror l6 is on the order of l0 nm. Therefore, the straightness of the movable table A of l00 µm can be corrected as a Doppler shift δ, thus causing no adverse effect on the precision of the measurement. As a consequence, the precision of the measurement of the Z component is influenced only by the degree of flatness of the mirror l6. Second to fifth embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 3 to 5. In these figures, elements corresponding to those of the first embodiment are designated by the same numerals, and detailed descriptions of these elements will be omitted. Fig. 3 shows the essential parts of the optical system of the second embodiment of the invention. The optical system operates in substantially the same manner as the system of the first embodiment, except that the incident rays are reflected by the polarizing prism 3 as S polarized waves, and after they are reflected by the mirror 5, the reflected rays are transmitted through the polarizing prism 3. In Fig. 3, numeral 28 designates a driving means for the condenser lens 4. Fig. 4 shows the essential parts of the optical system of the third embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the measuring rays are transmitted through the polarizing prism 3, reflected by the mirror 5, and thereafter reflected by the polarizing prism 3 under the action of the quater wavelength plate 7, and are then incident on the objective lens 2. The reflected rays from the object l to be measured are transmitted through the polarizing prism 3 under the action of a quater wavelength plate 7 , reflected by a mirror 5 , reflected by the polarizing prism 3, and finally returned in the reverse X direction. Thereafter, as in the first embodiment, a part of the reflected rays reaches the quater sectioned photodetector l4 through the special polarizing prism ll and the condenser lens l3, an error signal indicative of a inclination of the surface is generated, and the polarizing prism 3 is moved as appropriate in the direction of X, as shown in Fig. 4, by prism driving means 29. In this case, as shown in the figure, as the prism 3 is moved in the X direction, the optical path of the measuring rays incident on the objective lens 2 is subjected to parallel displacement, with no change in the length of the optical path of the reflected rays and that of the incident rays. In this way, according to the third embodiment of the invention, the optical path of the rays incident on the objective lens 2 can be moved only in the directions of X. As in the system according to the above third embodiment, it is also possible to arrange the system such that the measuring rays are reflected by the polarizing prism 3 in the direction of Z as S polarized waves before they are reflected by the mirror 5 , and that the reflected rays are transmitted through the polarizing prism 3 to the objective lens 2, as in the second embodiment. This arrangement is the fourth embodiment of the invention. Fig. 5 a and 5 b show the essential parts of the optical system of the fifth embodiment of the invention. In the fifth embodiment, the systems according to the first and third embodiments are combined. More specifically, as shown in Fig. 5 b , the polarizing prism 3 and a condenser lens 34 are integrally moved by X direction driving means 30 in the directions of X, so as to compensate the inclination in the direction X. Further, as shown in Fig. 5 a , the polarizing prism 3, and condenser lenses 34, 35 are integrally moved by Y direction driving means 3l in the directions of Y, so as to compensate the inclination in the direction of Y. In the system according to the fifth embodiment, measuring rays may first be reflected by the polarizing prism 3 and are then transmitted therethrough, as in the second to fourth embodiments. In Fig. 5, numerals 32 and 33 designate frames enclosing the portions of the optical system which are movable in the directions of X and in the directions of Y, respectively. The optical system according to the fifth embodiment operates to move the optical axis of the rays incident on the objective lens 2 along a two dimensional plane e.g. a plane defined by the X Y coordinates , and this operation is the same as that of the systems of the first and second embodiments. However, the fifth embodiment is advantageous in that it does not use the Faraday element 9. As described above, according to the invention, there is provided an optical measuring device adapted to conduct optical measurement in accordance with the optical heterodyning technique and without making direct contact with an object to be measured. In order to prevent the measuring rays from being reflected in different directions by the surface of the object in accordance with the inclination of the surface of the object, the device is capable of parallelly displacing the optical path of the incident rays without causing any change in the length of the optical path of the measuring beam and without causing any change in the position of the measuring spot, thereby eliminating measurement errors and improving the measuring precision.
