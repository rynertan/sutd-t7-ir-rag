## Description
Tetrahydroisoguinoline compounds, processes for preparation thereof and pharmaceutical composition containing themThis invention relates to novel tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds, processes for preparation thereof and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. More particularly it relates to a compound of the formula EMI1.1 wherein 9 is lower alkyl or phenyl lower alkyl, R2 is alkyl or phedyl lower alkyl, R3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl and R4 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or aralkyl, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Angiotcnsin I is converted by angiotensin converting enzyme ACE to antiotensin II. Said antiogensin II induces strong constriction of vascular smooth muscle and is causative of various forms of hypertension. in mammalian species. Qn the other hand, endogenous prostacyclin PG 12 , which is derived from arachidonic acid via prostaglandin H2 PG H2 by the action of PG I2 synthetase, is a potent hypotensive substance and causes a fall in blood pressure of, for example, spontaneously hypertensive rats c.f., Advances inProstaglandin and Thromboxane Research Vol. 7 1980 , pages 815 819 . As a result of investigations we have now found that, the tetrahydroisoquinoline compound I or a salt thereof shows potent ACE inhibitory effect and at the same time stimulates the production of PG 12, a vasodepressor substance, and is useful as a blood ptessure lowering agent. For example, when said inhibitory effect is estimated in vitro by the use of ACE isolated from pig s kidney, 3S 2 tN 2R 2 carboxy n decyl N ethylcarbamoyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid at a concentration of 4.2 x 109 mol liter shows 50 inhibition of the enzymatic activity of ACE.On the other hand, when administered orally to spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR , 3S 2 N 2R 2 ethoxycarbonyl 4 phenyl n butyl N ethylcarbamoyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid 1 2 calcium salt or 3S 2 N 2R 2 ethoxycarbonyl n decyl N ethylcarbamoyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid 1 2 calcium salt at a dose of 50.mg kg shows a decrease of about 35 mmHg in the blood pressure of said SHR and this blood pressure lowering effect of the compound lasts for more than 6 hours.Moreover, when the effect of a test compound on the production of PG 12 in vascular tissues is estimated by the use of pig s blood platelet lysate or microsome obtained from pig s aorta, 3S 2 EN 2R 2 carboxy n dodecyl N ethylcarbamoylD 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid shows 62 increase in the formation of PG 12 as compared with a control group. In addition, the compound I of the invention shows no substantial decrease in its hypotensive activity i.e., no substantial tolerance even after the repeated administration thereof to mammlian species.For example, when 3S 2 N 2R 2 ethoxycarbonyl n decyl N ethylcarbamoyl 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid 1 2 calcium salt is administered to SHR for 15 consequtive days, said compound can maintain almost the same potency of its hypotensive activity during the experiments. The compound I is further characteris.tic in that, in using said compound as the hypotensive agent, it can also inhibit the aggregation of blood platelet because it inhibits the C iiosynthesis of thromboxane A2, i.e., a potent vasQconstrictor which induces blood platelet aggregation. In the compound I of the present invention, representative examples of R1 include alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or pentyl and phenyl lower alkyl such as benzyl, phenethyl, phenylpropyl or phenylbutyl. On the other hand, representative examples of R2 include alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl or hexadecyl and phenyl lower alkyl such as benzyl, phenethyl, phenylpropyl or phenylbutyl. Representative examples of R3 include hydrogen and lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. Representative examples of R4 are hydrogen lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl and aralkyl. such as benzyl, phenethyl, p methoxybenzyl, dimethylphenyl or trimethyl phenyl.Among the compounds of the present invention, a preferred subgenus is those of the formula I in which R1 is alkyl of one to 3 carbon atoms, benzyl or phenetyl, R2 is alkyl of one to 16 carbon atoms, benzyl, phenethyl or phenylpropyl and R3 is hydrogen, alkyl of one to 2 carbon atoms, benzyl or phenethyl.More preferred subgenus is the compound of the formula I in which R1 is ethyl, R2 is alkyl of 6 to 12 carbon atoms or phenethyl, R3 is ethyl and R4 is hydrogen. While the compound I of the present invention can exist in the form of two diastereoisomers or four optical isomers due to the two asymmetric carbon atoms involved therein, all of these optical isomers or a mixture thereof are included within the scope of the invention. Among said optical isomers, however, the compound I in which the carbon atom at the 3rd position of isoquinoline ring hasS configuration, especially the one in which the carbon atom at the 3rd position of isoquinoline ring has S configuration and the carbon atom at the Znd position of the propionic mofety of th formula CH2 CH R2 COOR3 has R configuration, is preferred for medicinal use. The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds according to formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a therapeutically effective amount together with pharmaceuticalla acceptable carriers The compound I of the invention can be used for pharmaceutical use either as the free acid or a salt thereof.Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound I include, for example, inorganic salts such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts, organic salts such as lysine and arginine salts, and the like. A daily dose of the compound I or a salt thereof may be about 30 mg to about 3 g, especially 50 mg to one g, per body of patients. Further, the compound I or a salt thereof may be used in the form of a pharmaceutical preparation containing the same compound in conjunction or admixture with a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral or parenteral administration. Suitable excipients include, for example, starch, lactose, glucose, potassium phosphate, corn starch, arabic gum, stearic acid and other known medicinal excipients. The pharmaceutical preparations may be in solid form such as tablets, pills, capsules or suppositories or in liquid form such as solutions, suspensions or emulsions. They may be sterilized ar.d or may further contain auxiliaries such as stabilizing, wetting or emulsigying agent. The compound I of the present invention can be prepared according to the methods shown by the following reaction scheme EMI7.1 wherein R5 is lower alkyl or aralkyl, R6 is lower alkyl andR1 and R2 are the same as defined above. That is, according Method A, the compound I is prepared by the steps of i reacting the 1,2,3,4 tetrahydro isoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid derivative II with phosgene to give the 2 chlorocarbonyl 1, 2,3, 4 tetrahydrosioquinoline 3 carboxylic acid derivative III , ii condensing said compound III with the 3 aminopropionic acid derivative IV to give the 2 N,N disubstituted carbamoyl 1, 2,3,4 tetrahydroiscquinoline 3 carboxylic acid derivative V , and, if required, iii further subjecting the compound V to catalytic hydrogenation and or hydrolysis. On the other hand, according to Method B, the compound I is prepared by the steps of i reacting the 3 aminopropionic acid derivative IV with phosgene to give the N chlorocarbonyl3 amino propionic acid derivative, ii condensing said compound with the 1,2,3,4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid derivative II to give the 2 N,N disubstituted carbamoyl 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydrosioquinoline 3 carboxylic acid derivative V , and, if required, ii further subjecting the compound V to catalytic hydrogenation and or hydrolysis. The first step in the above mentioned Methods A or B, i.e., the reaction of the compound II or IV with phosgene, can be accomplished by treating said compound II or IV and phosgene in the presence or absence of an acid acceptor in a suitable solvent. Preferred examples of the group R5 in the compound II include lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl and aralkyl such as benzyl, phenethyl, p methoxybenzyl, diphenylmethyl or triphenylmethyl and preferred examples of the group R6 include lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. On the other hand, preferred examples of the acid acceptor include organic tertiary a mines such as triethylamine, tripropylamine,N methylmorpholine, pyridine and the like. Methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane are suitable as the solvent.It is preferred to carry out the reaction at a temperature of 00 to 300C, especially at a temperature below about 20 C. For example, the reaction is preferably carried out by dissolving phosgene in a solvent and then adding dropwise thereto at said temperature a solution containing the compound II or IV and the acid acceptor. After the reaction, the compound III or VI thus obtained can be used for the subsequent step without separating it from the reaction solution. If required, however, said compound TIT or VI may be isolated from said reaction solution by removing the excess of phosgene under reduced pressure. The condensation reaction of the compounds III and IV as well as the condensation reaction of the compounds VI and II can be conducted either in the presence or absence of an acid acceptor in a solvent. The acid acceptors and solvents exemplified in the first step as well as dimethylformamide are suitably used as said acid acceptor and solvent in this step. It is preferred to carry out the reaction at a temperature of 0 to 800C, especially at 350 to 40 C. The compound I in which both R3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms is prepared by further hydrolyzing the thus obtained compound V to remove the groups R5 and R6 therefrom.Said hydrolysis is readily carried out by treating the compound V with an alkali agent in a solvent. Preferred examples of the alkali agent include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide and alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. Water, lower alkanol e.g., methanol, ethanol or a mixture thereof are suitable as the solvent. The reaction proceeds smoothly at a temperature of about 00 to 500C, especially at about 200. to 300C. On the other hand, when the group R5 is aralkyl, the compound I in which R4 is hydrogen atom is prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of the compound V . This catalytic hydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a catalyst in a hydrogen gas atmosphere in a solvent. Preferred examples of the catalyst include palladium black, palladiumcarbon, platinum oxide and the like. Lower alkanols such as methanol, ethanol and propanol are suitable as the solvent.It is preferred to carry out the reacton at a temperature of about 200 to 400C under one to 5 atmospheric pressures and under shaking. For example, said reaction proceeds smoothly at about 250C under about 3 atmospheric pressure. Further, when the group R5 is aralkyl, the compound I in which both R3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms is prepared by further subjecting the compound V to catalytic hydrogenation and hydrolysis. These catalytic hydrogenation and hydrolysis can be carried out under the same conditions as described above. When the compound I of the present invention has one or two carboxyl group s within its molecule, said compound may be readily converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in conventional manners, for example, by neutralization with an alkali agent or amine. The starting compound II of the present invention involves two optical isomer, i.e., S and R isomers, due to the asymmetric carbon atom at the 3rd position of isoquinoline skeleton. However, since all of the above mentioned reactions of the invention can be carried out without racemization, the compound I of the present invention in an optically active form can be readily obtained by the use of the corresponding optically active isomer of the compound II as the starting material of the invention.If the compound IV in the form of a racemic mixture is used as the starting material in the above mentioned reactions, the optically active compound I thus obtained is composed of the two stereoisomers which differ in the steric configuration of the carbon atom at the 2nd position of 3 aminopropionyl moiety thereof, but these isomers may be readily separated into each components by silica gel chromatography using toluene ethyl acetate as a solvent. Throughout the specification, the isomer which is eluted in early fractions of silica gel column chromatography is designated as Id isomerl and the isomer which is eluted into late fractions thereof is designated as B isomer 1. Moreover, if required, the starting compound IV of the invention in the form of an optical active isomer may be used in the above mentioned reactions. Such optically active isomer of the compound IV may be obtained by optical resolution therof, i.e., by the steps of reacting the racemate of the compound IV with optically active N benzyloxycarbonyl phenylalanine in a solvent to form the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, and separating the diastereoisomeric salts into each components therof by selective crystallization.By said selective crystallization, less soluble enantiomer is recovered as crystals from the reaction mixture, and the more soluble one remains in the reaction mixture. IfN benzyloxycarbonyl D phenylalanine is used as the resolving agent, the compound IV having R configuration at the 2nd position of the propionic moiety of the formula CH2CE R2 CooR3 forms the less soluble diastereoisomeric 2 salt. On the other hand, if N benzyloxycarbonyl L phenyl alanine is used as the resolving agent, the compound IV having S configuration at the 2nd position of said propionic moiety forms the less soluble diastereoisomeric salt.Ethyl acetate is suitable as the solvent, and the selective crystallization can be readily conducted by adding isopropylether to an ethyl acetate solution containing the diastereoisomeric salts of the compound IV . It is preferred to use ethyl acetate in an amount of 3 to 5 ml per gram of the compound IV . It is also preferred that isopropylether which is used to cause the selective crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts is used in an amount of 0.5 to 2 ml per ml of ethyl acetate. After the optical resolution, the compound IV in free form can be recovered by treating the thus obtained diastereoisomeric salt with an alkali agent e.g., sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium or potassium hydroxide . Alternatively, the optical resolution of the starting compound IV may be conducted by the use of an optically active phenylalanine amide. For example, the optically active enantiomer of the compound IV may be obtained by converting it into a compound of the formula EMI13.1 wherein R1 and R2 are the same as defined above, reacting said compound IV with an optically active phenylalanine amide to form the diastereoisomeric salts thereof, separating the diastereoisomeric salts into each components by selective crystallization, esterifying the resultant optically active enantiomer with an alkanol of the formula R6 OH wherein R6 is the same as defined above , and then removing benzyloxycarbonyl group therefrom.The selective crystallization of the diastereoisomeric salts is readily conducted by cooling an ether solution thereof or by adding n hexane to an ethyl acetate solution thereof. On the other hand, the conversion of the compound IV into the compound IV can be carried out in conventional manners, for example, by reacting the former compound with benzyloxycarbonyl chloride and hydrolyzing it with an alkali agent such as sodium hydroxide The esterification of an optically active enantiomer of the compound IV and the removal of benzyloxycarbonyl group therefrom can also be conducting in a manner known per se. Concomitantly, among the starting compounds of the invention, the compound II is obtained by Pictet Spengler s condensation reaction of phenylalanine and formaldehyde to give 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline 3 carboxylic acid Journal of The American Chemical Society Vol. 70, page 180 1948 3, followed by conventional esterification thereof. On the other hand, the compound IV is obtained by reacting an alkyl or phenylalkyl malonic acid monoethyl ester with formaldehyde and diethylamine journal of The ChemicalSociety of Japan Vol. 80, page 502. 1959 , and then reacting the resulting acrylic ester derivative with a primary amine ,B.agner et al s Synthetic Organic Chemistry, page 673 1961 .
