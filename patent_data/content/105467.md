# Synthetic resin lens system.

## Abstract
A unitary magnification lens system for an electropho tographic imaging system including a transparent planar platen and a folded optical system. The lens system is formed of four elements made of synthetic resin. It has an f 5.6 aperture for increased light gathering power to ease the requirements of the imaging system illumination system a moderately wide field angle of 64 to image documents of up to 8 1 2 14 inches at a time, is non vignetting and includes aspherical surfaces on its four elements, arranged in two pairs, that deviate to as much as the tenth order from the conic.
