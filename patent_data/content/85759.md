# Production of wrinkle free piezoelectric films by poling.

## Abstract
A single or multi layer of films containing at least one oriented, piezoelectric sensitive PES film, sandwiched be tween resilient conductive liners, is subjected to a high dc field strength while the layer is maintained at an elevated temperature to induce piezoelectric properties in the oriented PES films without the films wrinkling.
