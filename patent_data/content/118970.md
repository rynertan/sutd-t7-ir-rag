# Deposit control method and composition.

## Abstract
A water system deposit control method and composition of high calcium tolerance are herein disclosed. The composi tion comprises a reaction product formed from acrylic acid, hydroxylated lower alkyl acrylate and hypophosphorous acid. In accordance with the method herein, an effective amount, from about 0.1 500 ppm of the composition is added to the water system, e.g., cooling water system, so as to inhibit the build up or agglomeration of undesirable deposits along the metal surfaces on contact with the water.
