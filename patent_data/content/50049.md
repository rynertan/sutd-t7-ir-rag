# Damping ring for rotating assemblies.

## Abstract
A damping ring for rotating assemblies as a wheel or the like is achieved by providing an annular groove 42 in a surface of the wheel 30 which is coaxial with the axis of the wheel. A viscoelastic damping material 44 subject to shear deformation during rotation of the wheel is positioned within the groove 42 against the surface of the groove, and an annular metal ring 46 is positioned in the groove 42 against the viscoelectric damping material with the damping material sandwiched between the ring 46 and the wheel 30 . By way of example, the ring 46 may be U shaped in cross section.
