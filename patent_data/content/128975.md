# Biologically active conjugates and their preparation and use.

## Abstract
Water soluble biologically active conjugates are made by coupling a protein, e.g. an enzyme, with an alkylene glycol ester of a polyuronic acid under alkaline conditions. The polyuronic acid is thus coupled to the protein by amide link ages and to the alkylene glycol residues via ester linkages. As compared with the unconjugated protein, the conjugates have better activity at higher pH values and higher tempera tures.
