# Downflow or upflow adsorbent fractionator flow control system.

## Abstract
Apparatus partlcularty applicable to the drying of gas es is provided for downflow or upflow adsorption of one or more first gases from a mixture thereof with a second gas to reduce the concentration of first gas in the mixture to below a permissible maximum concentration, having at least two sorbent beds 1 , of which one is on adsorption while the other is being regenerated, and pneumatlcally operated valves 13 16 for flow control of gas through the beds for adsorption and for regeneration. An overriding control such as a timer or a microprocessor programmed to control the regeneration time and urge flow fixes the time, and switches the adsorbent beds at the end of each cycle period.
