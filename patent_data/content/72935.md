# Optical electronic monitoring apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical electronic monitoring apparatus is used to detect undesired coil or lap formation at transport and drive rollers 13. For this purpose the mean 14 of a light barrier is arranged along the surface of the roller 13 parallel to its axis 23 in such a way that it is partially obscured by the cross section of the roller. The subsequent evaluation circuit has a low pass filter 16, a differentiation stage 17 and a further low pass filter 18.
