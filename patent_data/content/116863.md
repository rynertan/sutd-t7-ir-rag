# Interface for controlling the bidirectional data transfer between an asynchronous bus and a synchronous bus.

## Abstract
Interface of the parallel type containing data transfer between an asynchronous bus, to which a control processor is connected, and a synchronous bus connected to a plurality of terminals each sending its own synchronism signal on said synchronous bus. The control is realized by causing in a time equal to the shortest period of the synchronism signals at least a transfer from or towards each terminal and possibly a transfer from or towards the control processor. The interface assigns a priority to the transfers from or towards the terminals with respect to the transfers from or towards the control processor, and interrupts these latter transfers at the end of the instruction in progress if it receives a pulse of one of the synchronism signals to start a transfer towards the corresponding terminal. In addition, said inter face controls the transfers relevant to the terminals in time sequence with a fixed priority.
