## Description
TITLE Improvements in or relating to drive and brake assemblies. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to an assembly which includes a transmission system having drive means and a braking system having braking means and is particularly concerned with such an assembly in which transmission from the drive means to means driven thereby is through a gear assembly, the ratio of which is infinitely variable between predetermined limits. STATEMENT OF INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES According to the present invention there is provided an assembly comprising a transmission system having drive means providing an input to a gear assembly and driven means coupled to be driven by an output of the gear assembly, said gear assembly being variable in ratio between predetermined limits and responding automatically to variations in predetermined characteristics of, or applied to, the transmission system to vary the gear ratio which is transmitted between the drive means and the driven means, a braking system having brake means for braking the driven means and which brake means is operable independently of the drive means and a control system communicating between the braking system and the transmission system, said control system being responsive to actuation of the brake means and reacting on the gear assembly automatically upon actuation of the brake means to vary the gear ratio which is transmitted between the drive means and the driven means. The present invention may be applied to arrangements in which the gear assembly is variable in ratio in step wise manner by providing an appropriate control system which causes a step wise change in the gear ratio automatically upon actuation of the brake means.Preferably however the gear assembly is infinitely variable in ratio. Preferably the control system is responsive to actuation of the brake means and reacts on the gear assembly upon actuation of the brake means automatically to adjust the gear assembly into a lower gear ratio. By such automatic adjustment of the gear assembly to a lower gear ratio in response to actuation of the brake means, such torque as is available at the input to the gear assembly can be utilised to assist in braking the driven means together with such braking as is achieved by actuation of the brake means.It is usual with conventional transmission systems having infinitely variable and automatically responsive gear assemblies that upon actuation of brake means to brake driven means of the transmission system the transmission speed or power to the input of the gear assembly is reduced, usually simultaneously with or immediately before, the brake means is actuated and this reduction causes a change in the characteristics of the transmission system so that the gear assembly responds to provide a natural decrease in gear ratio. By the present invention this latter mentioned natural response which may be inherent in the characteristics of the gear assembly is complemented by an additional response resulting from the control system by actuation of the brake means.In this way it is believed possible to achieve faster and more efficient braking of the driven means than that which would be achieved in conventional transmission and braking assemblies where the driven means is braked by operation of the brake means and there is also a degree of braking achieved by reaction against the torque of the drive means by the natural lowering of the ratio of the gear assembly in response to the change in characteristics of the system. The present invention can be applied to transmission systems incorporating conventional infinitely variable and automatically responsive gear assemblies where in each case the ratio of the gear assembly is varied wholly or in part by adjustment of an element or component of the gear as appropriate, such adjustment being effected manually, mechanically, by fluid pressure actuation for example hydraulic or pneumatic , electrically or otherwise, As a broad concept therefore the present invention is the incorporation of the control system to vary or adjust the positioning of the aforementioned element or component in the gear assembly in direct response to actuation of the brake means to bring about a variation in the gear ratio of the assembly, usually by causing a decrease in such ratio.By way of example the gear assembly can be of conventional variable swash plate type the angle of a transmission plate in which is caused to be adjusted through the control system in response to operation of the brake means or a conventional Wopp speed variator in which transmission is effected through co axial cones by ball members mounted in a tiltable frame so that variations in tilt of the frame cause variations in relative speeds of rotation of the two cones and the tilting of such frame can be responsive to actuation of the brake means through the control system to cause the variation in the gear ratio w1 en the brake means is operated In a preferred embodinsent the variable ratio gear assembly is in accordance with the invention which is the subject of our co pending PatentApplication vase 228 in which drive is transmitted by friteion or oil film engagement between a drive member and a driven member in the gear, one such member having an axially rotatable drive face with which the other member engages to be rotated thereby, the speed of rotation of that other member being determined by its radius of engagement on the drive face and that other member being displaceable radially over the drive face to vary the gear ratio In the application of the present invention to this latter preferred form of gear assembly the aforementioned radial displacement of the member which engages with the drive face is made responsive, through the control system, to actuation of the brake means so that ups. such actuation the aforementioned radius of engagement is changed automatically to vary the gear ratio. The control system which communicates between the braking system and the transmission system can be mechanically, electrically and or fluid pressure operated. The present invention was primarily developed for use in motor driven vehicles and there is further provided a vehicle which includes an assembly as above specified as being in accordance with the invention and in which the driven means comprises ground engaging means by which the vehicle is propelled. In the majority of applications the ground engaging means will be driven wheels and the brake means will be hydraulically actuated in response to manual pressure applied thereto. In a conventional hydraulically actuated vehicle braking system, upon application of the brakes fluid pressure increases in the system and in accordance with the present invention this variation in fluid pressure can be utilised to adjust the ratio of the gear assembly through the control system. By way of example, variations of hydraulic fluid pressure in the braking system can be utilised to control actuation of a valve which is responsive to such variations, the valve being located in the control system and serving to control fluid pressure in the transmission system from a predetermined source to the gear assembly.The latter fluid pressure serves wholly or in part to vary the ratio of the gear assembly so that such ratio varies in accordance with variations in the fluid pressure. ay this arrangement when the fluid pressure in the braking system attains a predetermined value the valve can be actuated to adjust fluid flow in the transmission system to the gear assembly, possibly by opening communication between that fluid flow and a reservoir so that the gear assembly reacts t6 vary the gear ratio accordingly, usually as previously mentioned to reduce the gear ratio. One embodiment of an assembly constructed in accordance with the present invention and incorporating a motor vehicle transmission system will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying illustrative drawings, in which Figure 1 is a section through a gear assembly which is incorporated in the transmission system Figure 2 is a section taken on the line A A of the gear assembly in Figure 1 Figure 3 diagrammatically illustrates an assembly according to the invention in which, for convenience, ground engaging driven wheels have been omitted from the transmission system and brake means for such wheels have been omitted from the braking system Figure 4 illustrates a valve incorporated in a control system between the braking and transmission systems, andFigure 5 shows the valve of Figure 4 in a different mode of operation. Where possible throughout the following description the same parts or members as referred to in each of the Figures have been accorded the same references. The gear assembly 100 which is incorporated in the transmission system and is shown particularly in Figures 1 and 2 is the subject of our co pending Patent Application Case 228 and for convenience will be considered for oil film drive it being realised however that friction drive can be employed if required . The gear assembly 100 has a housing 1 within which housing is an input shaft 3 having an axis of rotation 2. The shaft 3 is rotatably mounted in the housing 1 by inclined roller bearings 4 which co operate between the shaft anr the housing to restrain relative axial movement between the shaft 3 and the housing. One end of the shaft 3 extends from the housing 1 for connection to drive means and the other, inner, end of the shaft has a blind bore 5 which receives a cylindrical spigot 6 co axial with the shaft 3. The spigot 6 is coupled to the shaft 3 by a pin and boomerang shaped slot arrangement 7 so that the spigot is capable of restricted rotation relative to the shaft 3 and during such rotation in either one or the opposite sense of direction the spigot will be displaced axially relative to the shaft 3 in a direction rightwardly in Figure 1. The spigot 6 is an integral part of a flange member 8 having a flat annular drive face 9 which is co axial with the axis 2 and extends perpendicularly relative to that axis. Capable of abutting the drive face 9 is an annular roller 10 which is mounted for rotation about an axis 11 extending substantially perpendicularly and radially relative to the axis 2. The roller 10 is rotatably mounted by a ball bearing 12 on a piston 13 slidably mounted in a cylinder 14 of a cylindrical piston housing 15. A piston chamber 16 is formed between the piston 13 and its cylinder and communicating with this chamber is a fluid pressure port 17.Also communicating with the piston chamber 16 is a secondary piston chamber 18 which is co axial with the cylinder 14 and axially slidable within which is a secondary piston 19. The secondary piston 19 is capable of restricted axial displacement in its cylinder 18 to enter the piston chamber 16 and abut the piston 13.An annular ring or clip 20 is provided in the wall of the cylinder 18 to retain the secondary piston 19. The secondary piston 19 forms with its cylinder a secondary piston chamber 2i communicating with which is a fluid port 22. The piston and cylinder devices 13, 14 and 18, 19 are single acting and the piston 13 is biased relative to the housing 1 by a spring 23 in a sense to contract the pressure chamber 16 and, when the piston 13 is in abutment with the secondary piston 19, to contract the pressure chamber 21. Extending through the spring 23 is a piston rod 24 which communicates at one end with the piston 13 while its other end projects from the housing 1 in slidably sealed manner so that the piston rod 24 is displaceable along the axis 11 in unison with the piston 13.The piston rod 24 provides a convenient means for axially displacing the piston 13 manually. The piston housing 15 is ted in an aperture 25 in the wall of the housing 1 in sealed manner and is retained relative to the housing 1 against displacement in the direction of axis 11 by a pair of pivot pins 26 see Figure 2 .The piston housing 15 is mounted by the pins 26 to be capable of restricted pivotal movement substantially in a plane which includes the axes 2 and 11. Diametrically opposed to the position of its abutment with the drive face 9, the roller 10 abuts a second drive face 27 formed by a flat side face of an annular disc 28 having shafts 29 which are integral and co axial therewith and by which the disc 28 is mounted through needle rollers 30 in the housing 1 for rotation about an axis 31. The drive face 27 extends perpendicularly relative to the axis 31 which latter axis is parallel with the axis 2. The annular side face of the disc 28 which is axially opposite to the face 27 provides a third drive face 32 which is parallel with face 27. In abutment with the face 32 is a second annular roller 33 which is mounted for rotation about an axis 34. The axis 34 extends substantially perpendicularly relative to the axis 31 and is substantially parallel with the axis 11 associated with the first roller 10. The roller 33, similarly to the roller 10, is rotatably mounted through a ball bearing 35 on a piston 36 which is slidable in the direction of the axis 34 in a cylinder 37 of a cylindrical piston housing 38. The piston housing 38 is mounted in an aperture in the all of the housing 1 in sealed manner and is reta ned elative to the hosing 1 against displacement in the direction of the axis 34 by a pair of pivot pins not shown similarly to the piston housing 15. The piston housing 38 is mounted by the pins associated therewith to be capable of restricted pivotal movement substantially in a plane which includes the axes 31 and 34. Formed between the piston.36 and its cylinder 37 is a variable pressure chamber 39 communicating with which is a fluid port 40.The piston 36 and cylinder 37 form a single acting device which, in the present embodiment, is intended to be operated by a reduction in air pressure or a vacuum applied to the chamber 39 consequently the piston 36 is biased by a spring 41 to an expanded condition of the chamber 39 in which the piston 36 abuts the wall of housing 1. Similarly to the piston 13, the piston 36 has connected thereto a piston rod 42 which projects in sealed manner through the wall of the housing 1 to slide in unison with the piston and provides a convenient means for manually displacing the piston in its cylinder 37. At a position diametrically opposed to the position of engagement between the roller 33 and drive face 328 the roller 33 abuts a fourth drive face 43 formed by a circular end face on a flange 44 of an output shaft 45 which projects from the housing 1. The shaft 45 is mounted for rotation about an axis 46 which is co axial with the axis 2 and the drive face 43 is flat and extends perpendicularly relative to the axis 46. The shaft 45 is rotatably mounted in the housing 1 by inclined roller bearings 47 which bearings are connected between the shaft and the housing to restrain relative axial displacement between those components. Associated with the drive face 9 is a non driving region , formed by a circular flat face 49 of a rotor 50. The circular flat face 49 is located centrally of and is coplanar with the drive face 9 and the rotor 50 is freely mounted for co axial rotation relative to the flange member 8 within which it is housed by a ball bearing 51. When the piston chamber 16 is in its fully contracted condition which may be regarded as a neutral condition of the gear as shown in Figure 1 the roller 10 abuts the non driving region 49 of the drive face 9 and in this condition the roller 10 also abuts the marginal outer edge portion of the drive face 27. Also in the otral condition of the gear the roller 33 abuts the drive face 32 at a position radially inwardly of the roller 10 with respect to the axis 31. The interior of the housing 1 is filled with a traction fluid such as a cycloaliphatic synthetic hydrocarbon fluid, for example, that made by Monsanto Limited and sold under the trade name Santotrac , which is a fluid found suitable for oil film drives. The shaft 3 is coupled to be rotatably driven by an internal combustion vehicle engine 52 see Figure 3 and the flange member 8 is driven in unison therewith through the pin and slot arrangement 7. If however the gear is in its neutral condition with the roller 10 abutting the face 49 the latter rotates freely within the drive face 9 The control valve 63 which forms part of a control system communicating between the transmission system and a braking system for the driven wheels of the vehicle is shown in greater detail in Figures 4 and 5 and comprises a spool 65 axially slidable in a spool cylinder 66 formed by a spool housing. The spool has two axially spaced lands between which is formed a spool transfer chamber 67 which is in constant communication with the conduits 62 and 64 communicating between the pressure chamber 16 and the pump 60.Formed between a rebate in one end of the spool 65 and the opposing end of the spool cylinder 66 is a spool pressure chamber 68 hich is in constant communication it a conduit tC or tz control ssm. As shown in Figure 3, the conduit 69 communicates with an hydraulic braking system shown partly at 70 for the driven wheels of the vehicle. The braking system can be of conventional type having a master brake cylinder 71 actuated by a pedal 72 to apply hydraulic pressure by way of conduit 73 to operate the vehicle brakes. The spool 65 of the control valve 63 is biased in its cylinder 66 by a spring 74 so that the spool normally abuts against the end of its cylinder where the chamber 68 is at a minimum volume. In this latter condition of the spool, a land thereof closes a port to a conduit 75 which communicates with the reservoir 61. The control valve 63 is arranged so that when the chamber 68 is pressurised and the spool 65 is displaced axially against its spring biasing from the position shown in Figure 4, the conduit 75 will open to cor.munication with chnmber 67 and thereby to communication with conduits 62 and 64 as shorn in Figure 5 .Pressurisation of the chamber 68 will occur automatically to progressively displace the spool 65 as hydraulic pressure increases in the,braking system 70 to actuate the vehicle brakes upon operation of the pedal 72. Since the output shaft 45 in the transmission system is coupled to drive the ground engaging wheels, fluid pressure variations in the piston chambers 16, 21 and 39 will occur in response to engine speed and to vehicle speed so that the transmission ratio through the gear assembly 100 can be related to vehicle speed as sensed by the output from the pump 60. By the arrangement above described with reference toFigure 3, when the input shaft 3 is rotatably driven by the engine 52 the pump 54 is operated to pressurise chamber 21 and thereby displace the secondary piston 19 and thereby the piston 13 and roller 10 to progressi ly increase the gear ratio as the engine. speed increases until the piston 19 abuts stop 20. In addition, as the vehicle speed increases so does the output from the pump 60 and thereby for so long as the braking system 70 is in operative the pressure in the piston chamber 16 increases to displace or further displace the piston 13 from its cylinder to a maximum extent where that piston abuts against the wall of the housing 1 to increase the gear ratio accordingly. Upon throttling back or closing the engine throttle, there will be a corresponding decrease in pressure or an increased vacuum effect provided in the engine induction manifold 57 which reacts through the conduit 58 in the piston chamFer 39 to di3p17Q the piston 36 docmwar,iy in Figure 1 and so u1 t. ler vary increase the ratio which is transmitted throch the gear, assembly By incorporating the coupling 7 which may be regarded as double acting in the gear assembly 100 the torque of the engine 52 can be utilised to assist in braking of the vehicle upon a decrease in speed of the shaft 3 since the engagement between the roller 10 and drive face 9 will cause the coupling 7 to reverse, and the driven vehicle wheels to react against the engine torque. The control valve 63 of the control system which communicates between the transmission system and the braking system 70 will serve to provide braking of the vehicle in addition to the braking system. Upon operation of the brakes by actuation of the braking system 70 the spool 65 is displaced against its spring biasing to open communication between conduits 62, 64 and 75 as aforementioned. Consequently, the output from pump 60 will pass directly to the reservoir 61 and the piston chamber 16 is also open to communication by way of chamber 67 and conduit 75 with the reservoir 61 as sho in Figure 5 therefore any hydraulic fluid pressure in the chamber 16 is relieved automatically and the piston 13 ill unless resisted by the secondary piston 19 be diplaced by the spring 23 down ardly Figure 1 automatically te decrease the gear ratio so that the engine torque is used to brake the vehicle in addition to the braking system.
