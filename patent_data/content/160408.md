## Description
BENZOTHIOPHENES, THEIR PRODUCTION AND USE, AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM This invention relates to benzothiophenes, their production and use, and compositions containing them. The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that certain 3 hydroxybenzothiophenes having 2enamido side chains are effective cyclooxygenase and 54ipoxygenase inhibitors and are therefore useful in the treatment of inflammation and other prostaglandins leukotriene mediated diseases. Such compounds have also been found useful in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure, especially when accompanied by pathological damage. Furthermore, they are useful cytoprotective agents. Among various potent biological mediators derived from the oxygenation of arachidonic acid, prostaglandins and leukotrienes have been linked to various diseases. Notably, the biosynthesis of prostaglandins has been identified as a cause of inflanation, arthritic conditions e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout , psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and pain. Furthermore, the formation of leukotrienes has been connected to immediate hypersensitivity reactions and pro inflammatory effects. It has been established that arachidonic acid undergoes oxygenation via two major enzymatic pathways 1 The pathway catalyzed by the enzyme cyclooxygenase and 2 The pathway catalyzed by the enzyme 5 lipoxygenase. Interruption of these pathways by enzyme inhibition has been explored for effective therapy.For example, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs UNSAID such as aspirin, indomethacin and diflunisal are known cyclooxygenase inhibitors which inhibit the process wherein arachidonic acid is oxygenated via cyclooxygenase to prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Recently, it has been observed that certain leukotrienes are responsible for diseases related to immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as human asthma, allergic disorders, and skin diseases. In addition, certain leukotrienes and derivatives thereof are believed to play an important role in causing inflammation B. Samuelsson, Science, 220, 568 83 7 D. Bailey et al, Ann. Rpts. Med. Chem., 17, 203 1982 . Conditions involving elevated intraocular pressures which are too high for normal function may result in irreversible loss of visual function. For example, glaucoma, if untreated, may eventually lead to blindness. Ocular hypertension, i.e., the condition of elevated intraocular pressure without optic nerve head damage or characteristic glaucomatous visual field defects, is now believed by many ophthalmologists to represent the earliest phase of glaucoma. Many of the drugs formerly used to treat glaucoma proved not entirely satisfactory. Indeed, few advances were made in the treatment of glaucoma since pilocarpine and physostigmine were introduced.Only recently have clinicians noted that many ss adrenergic blocking agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure. While many of these agents are effective in reducing intraocular pressure, they also have other characteristics, e.g. membrane stabilizing activity, that are not acceptable for chronic ocular use. To be an effective and acceptable topical agent, for treating inflammation in the eye, or ocular hypertension related diseases such as glaucoma, the drug must not only penetrate the ophthalmic tissues to reach the active sites within the eye, but it must also be devoid of those side effects including irritation, allergic reaction and the like which would militate against long term administration. With respect to the cytoprotective activity of the compounds of the present invention, it has been known that 1 gastric cytoprotection does notinvolve inhibition of gastric acid secretion. For example, protaglandin F2B does not inhibit gastric acid secretion, but it does induce gastric cytoprotection S. Szabo et al., Experimentia, 38, 254, 1982 2 lower effective dosages of cytoprotective agents are required than that of gastric acid inhibitors and 3 the cytoprotective activity of a compound may be observed in both animals and man by noting the increased resistance of gastrointestinal mucosa to strong irritants. For example, animal studies have shown that cytoprotective compounds will prevent gastric lesions induced by oral administration of strong acids, strong bases, ethanol, hypertonic saline, etc. The present invention provides novel compounds of formula EMI4.1 and their pharmacentically acceptable salts.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution.In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic monoor diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compounds of Formula I are employed. Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.01 mg to about 150 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the aboveindicated conditions about 0.5 mg to about 7.5 gms.per patient per day . For example, inflammation may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.2 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day about 20 mg to about 3.5 gms per patient per day . Preferably a dosage of from about 1 mg to about 20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day may produce good results about 25 mg to about 1 gm per patient per day . The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may contain from 0.5 mg to 5 gm of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. Particularly, for use in treatment of ophthalmic conditions including those associated with elevated intraocular pressure such as glucoma or other inflammation in the eye. The e active compound can be administered topically or systemically when it is appropriate. The dose administered can be from as little as 0.1 to 25 mg or more per day, singly or preferably on a 2 to 4 dose per day regimen although a single dose per day is satisfactory. when given systemically, the drug can be given by any route, although the oral route is preferred. In oral administration the drug can be employed in any of the usual dosage forms such as tablets or capsules, either in a contemporaneous delivery or sustained release form. Any number of the usual excipients or tableting aids can likewise be included. when given by the topical route, the active drug or an ophthalmologically acceptable salt thereof such as the sodium or potassium salt is formulated into an ophthalmic preparation. In such formulations, from 0.1 to 15 by weight can be employed. The objective is to administer a dose of from 0.1 to 10 mg per eye per day to the patient, with treatment continuing so long as the condition persists. Thus, in an ophthalmic solution, insert, ointment or suspension for topical delivery, or a tablet, intramuscular, or intravenous composition for systemic delivery, the active medicament or an equivalent amount of a salt thereof is employed, the remainder being carrier, excipients, preservatives and the like as are customarily used in such compositions. The active drugs of this invention are most suitably administered in the form of ophthalmic pharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration to the eye such as a suspension, ointment, or as a solid insert. Formulations of these compounds may contain from 0.01 to 15 and especially 0.5 to 2 of medicament. Higher dosages as, for example, about 10 , or lower dosages can be employed provided the dose is effective in reducing or controlling elevated intraocular pressure. As a unit dosage from between 0.001 to 10.0 mg, preferably .005 to 2.0 mg, and especially 0.1 to 1.0 mg of the compound is generally applied to the human eye, generally on a daily basis in single or divided doses so long as the condition being treated exists. As with all medications, dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized on the basis of the disease and the response of the patient. The pharmaceutical preparation which contains the active compound may be conveniently admixed with a non toxic pharmaceutical organic carrier, or with a non toxic pharmaceutical inorganic carrier. Typical of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are, for example, water, mixtures of water and water miscible solvents such as lower alkanols or aralkanols, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, petroleum based jelly, ethyl cellulose, ethyl oleate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, isopropyl myristate and other conventionally employed acceptable carriers.The pharmaceutical preparation may also contain non toxic auxiliary substances such as emulsifying, preserving, wetting agents, bodying agents and the like, as for example, polyethylene glycols 200, 300, 400 and 600, carbowaxes 1,000, 1,500, 4,000, 6,000 and 10,000, antibacterial components such as quaternary ammonium compounds, phenylmercuric salts known to have cold sterilizing properties and which are non injurious in use, thimerosal, methyl and propyl paraben, benzyl alcohol, phenyl ethanol, buffering ingredients such as sodium chlaride, sodium borate, sodium acetates, gluconate buffers, and other conventional ingredients such as sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, oleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitylate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, monothioglycerol, thiosorbitol, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and the like. Additionally, suitable ophthalmic vehicles can be used as carrier media for the present purpose including conventional phosphate buffer vehicle systems, isotonic boric acid vehicles, isotonic sodium chloride vehicles, isotonic sodium borate vehicles and the like. The pharmaceutical preparation may also be in the form of a solid insert such as one which after dispensing the drug remains essentially intact, or a bio erodible insert that either is soluble in lacrimal fluids, or otherwise disintegrates. The following examples of ophthalmic formulations are given by way of illustration.

The vials containing the hydrated insert are then autoclaved at 2500F 1210C for half an hour. It is highly preferred that the solid inserts of this invention be available for use by the patient in a pathogen free condition. Thus, it is preferred to sterilize the inserts and to ensure against recontamination, the sterilization is preferably conducted after packaging. The best mode of sterilizing is to employ ionizing radiation including radiation emanating from Cobalt 60 or high energy electron beams.

It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. Biological Data Supporting the Utility of the Compound Within the Scope of the Invention. The following is a summary of biological data from three standard bioassays. These data serve to illustrate that the compound of formula I , e.g., 3 hydroxy 5 trifluoromethyl N 2 phenyl 2 2 thienyl l benzolb thiophene 2 carboxamide hereinafter referred to as compound A , are 1 dual cyclooxygenase lipoxygenase inhibitors useful as anti inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic agents and 2 cytoprotective agents useful in the prevention or treatment of gastric irritation and lesions.1. Platelet Activating Factor. Induced Hyperalgesia in the Rat. In this assay, which is sensitive to inhibition.by lipoxygenase inhibitors but not cyclooxygenase inhibitors, compound A markedly reduced the pain response to PAF ED50 0.19 mg kg p.o. Table 1 .Indomethacin, ibuprof en, piroxicam, and benoxaprofen were completely ineffective in this assay Table 2 . Groups of 10 female Sprague Dawley rats, 35 50 g Taconic Farms , were fasted overnight prior to testing. Hyperalgesia was induced in the rat by the subplantar injection of 1 Zg PAF in physiological saline. Pain threshold was measured by applying pressure to the plantar surface of the hindpaw by means of a compressed air driven piston with a 2 mm tip. Vocalization thresholds were obtained 3 hr after injection of the PAF. Compounds, prepared at various doses in 1 methylcellulose suspension, were administered perorally 30 min before PAF. For each drug treatment group, animals with response pressures in the inflamed paw of 200 of control was considered to be analgesic. The mean vocalization threshold for each group was also calculated. The ED50 and 95 confidence limits were calculated by regression analysis.

PHENYLBENZOQUINONE PBQ induced writhing in the Mouse In this assay which is sensitive to inhibition by cyclooxygenase but not lipoxygenase inhibitors, Compound A effectively inhibitedPBQ induced writhing ED50 1 mg kg p.o. Table 3 . The analgesic activity of Compound A was equivalent to piroxicam and greater than ibuprofen. Groups of 10 female mice CD 1, CharlesRiver Breeding Laboratories , weighing 20 25 g were fasted overnight prior to experiments. Test substances, suspended in 1 methylcellulose, were administered orally 60 minutes prior to the intraperitoneal administration of PBQ 10 ml kg of O.02 solution . The mice were placed in individual boxes and exactly 5 minutes later were observed for writhes abdominal contractions, lordosis, and hindlimb extension for a 10 minute interval as a measure of pain induction. The e number of writhes for each animal was recorded and the group means and standard errors were calculated. The means obtained from the drug treated groups were compared to the vehicle control means values and percent inhibition of writhing was calculated.ED50 values were calculated by regression analysis.

Adjuvant Arthritis Assay In the chronic 21 days , developing adjuvant arthritis assay in the rat, Compound A evoked marked inhibition of swelling of the noninjected hindpaw. Table 4 shows that the ED50 of Compound A at day 14 was 3.0 mg kg and was still active at days 21 with an ED50 of 10 mg kg. X ray analysis of the hindpaw joints of these animals on day 21 showed that protection of the bone and cartilage destruction was only seen at the 10 mg kg day dose level. Indomethacin at a dose level of 1 EgXkg day provided virtually complete protection from hard tissue destruction. During the development of adjuvant arthritis, the rats lose body weight, the thymus gland involutes and the adrenal gland weight increases.At both dose levels, Compound A significantly inhibited body weight loss although the animals still showed a net loss of body weight , and at 10 mgvkg day inhibited the loss in weight of the thymus Table 5 . Female Lewis rats purchased from CharlesRiver, Wilmington, MA were sorted into groups of ten in the weight range 160 199g. The rats were sensitized to Mycobacterium butyricum Difco by the subplantar injection of 0.1 ml light mineral oil Lubinol, Purepac Pharmaceutical Co., Elizabeth, NJ containing 0.5 mg of the. Mycobacterium into the left hindpaw. The Mycobacterium suspension was prepared by grinding in a glass mortar followed by the addition of the appropriate volume of light mineral oil. The suspension was transferred to a glass vial and stirred for 15 minutes on a magnetic stirrer to obtain a uniform suspension.After sensitization the rats were returned to metronic wire bottomed cages and allowed food and water ad libitum with the food placed on the bottom of the cages for easy access.Using this protocol, evidence of systemic involvement swelling of the contralateral hindpaw was seen 12 14 days after sensitization. Rats received compound daily perorally as a suspension in 0.25 agar starting on the day of sensitization. Disease was quantitated by measuring the volume of the noninjected hindpaw by mercury displacement on days 0, 14 and 21. On day 21 at the termination of the experiment x rays of the noninjected hindpaw were taken using a Phillips dental x ray machine. Total body weight was determined on days 0 and 21 and at the termination of the experiment the thymus was removed and weighed. The statistical significance of the data was determined using Students t test.

Cytoprotection Assey Male Sprague Dawley rats, 130 150 g each.were sorted into groups for assay. The rats were fasted for 24 honrs. Ulcers were then induced by peroral administration of indonethacin 10 mg kg in 0.5S methyl cellulose, and compound A in 0.5 methylcellulose was perorally administered. Several hours after the administration of compound A, the animals are sacrificed, the stomachs removed, excises along the inner curvature, washed carefully with cool tap water and placed in O.9S saline. When all groups have been processed, the mucosal region of the stomachs are examined under a magnifying lens and scored according to the total number of lesions present. Group scores represent the mean score of animals in that group.
