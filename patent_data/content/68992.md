# LINKED DATA SYSTEMS

## Abstract
A link 10 exchanges data between a master MC and side SC computer. Each computer has control lines 26A, 42 and incompatible information lines 26B, 26C, CA1 15, CX1 21 . The master computer MC includes a master interface 28 connected to the information and control lines 26 of the master computer MC . The master interface 28 has separate intercommunication lines LA B and inter mediate 34 lines. This master interface 28 is able to provide an intermediate signal on its intermediate lines 34 in response to signals provided by the master computer MC on its control lines 26A . The link 10 includes a computing subsystem 30 and a slave interface 38 . The computing subsystem 30 is connected to the intercom munication LA B and intermediate 34 lines of the master interface 28 . The computing subsystem 30 has command lines 36 for providing thereon a command signal in response to the intermediate signal. The slave interface 38 is connected to the intercommunication lines LA B of the master interface 28 , to the command lines 36 of the computing subsystem 30 and to the control lines 42 of the slave computer SC . The slave interface 38 can pro vide a signal to the control lines 42 of the slave computer SC in response to the command signal.
