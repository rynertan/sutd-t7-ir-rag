# Absorption heat pump comprising an integrated generator and rectifier.

## Abstract
An absorption heat pump comprising a generator which is provided with a condensation pipe 59 comprising a lower generating section 79 and an adjoining upper rectifying section 81 . The upper section 81 is filled with a thermally insulating gas 87 which separates the generating section 79 from the rectifying section 81 . Thus, a simple construc tion is obtained, in which the rectifier is integrated in the generator.
