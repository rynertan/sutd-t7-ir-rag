# System and method for communication between nodes of a closed loop local communication path.

## Abstract
In an exemplary embodiment a transmission link switch 11 15 is provided at each node 1 5 . In a transmission mode, the switch provides a transmission path which transmits incoming messages directly to the node output without any processing delay. In the cutoff mode of the switch e.g. 14 , the associated data processor e.g. 4 still receives messages from the node input, but the direct path from the node input to the node output is interrrupted. During the sending of messages and responses thereto, the link switches at the sending and responding nodes are operated so as to prevent the messages from making multiple traverses of the loop communications path while also avoiding the occurrence at the other nodes of a communications gap which would permit such nodes to interfere with the exchange of messages. The arrangement is such that each node 1 5 can be implemented with low cost integrated circuit modules.
