# Powered airfoil canopy aircraft.

## Abstract
Load lines 16, 20 connect chordwise spaced portions of a ram air inflated, airfoil canopy 28 to spaced anchors 116 connected to a pilot supporting vehicle frame 40 on which a forward thrust producing unit 48 is removably mounted. The geometry of the assembled aircraft 10 enhan ces take off inflation of the canopy, establishes a stable flight frame when airborne, and enables simple engine throttle control of the thrust producing unit to regulate climb, descent and level flight. Common control 46 is applied for both grond steering of the vehicle frame and air borne steering of the canopy.
