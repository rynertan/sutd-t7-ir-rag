# Photographic silver halide colour materials and process for the production of dye images by diffusion transfer.

## Abstract
Photographic material and process suitable for produc ing by diffusion transfer a colour image and comprising on a support at least two differently spectrally sensitive negative working silver halide emulsion layers Figure 3, layers 12, 14 and 16 and having operatively associated with each of said emulsion layers a different non diffusing dye providing compound that is initially immobile in an alkali permeable colloid medium and wherefrom by reduction in alkaline medium a dye or dye precursor can be split off in diffusible state, wherein at least one of said negative working silver halide emulsion layers is associated in water permeable relationship with a visible light sensitive direct positive emulsion layer Figure 3, layers 13 and 15 whereby interim age effects can be obtained.
