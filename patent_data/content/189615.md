# METHOD OF USING COMPLEMENTARY LOGIC GATES TO TEST FOR FAULTS IN ELECTRONIC COMPOUNDS

## Abstract
A pair of complementary logic gates A and B are used to test for faults in a group of electronic components C1 C3 which provide respective component signals S1 S3 indicative of their condition. One A of the gates generates the logical OR or NOR of the component signals. The other B generates their logical AND or NAND. The test procedure involves providing the components with information pat terns that would ideally cause all the component signals to go to a logical 0 in one step and to logical 1 in another step. The actual values of the gate output signals OA and OB during these two steps are then compared with the respective ideal values to assess the condition of the components.
