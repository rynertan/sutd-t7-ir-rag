# Hand held labeler.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a hand held labeler which has a housing 11 that carries a supply roll R of labels L . The labels L can be successively dispensed in response to actuation of a manually operable actuator 20 . The supply roll R is prevented from unraveling by means of an improved retainer 61 having a pair of arms which prevent the supply roll R from telescoping. The arms have flanges which prevent the roll R from excessive unwinding or mushrooming.
