1. Coupling agent of living polymers of formula

## Description
The anionic polymerization, if accomplished under suitable conditions and with suitable monomers M. Szwarc, Carbanions, Living Polymers and El. Transfer Processes, Interscience Publishers, J. Wiley Sons, New York 1968 allows living polymers to be obtained, which are well suited to suitable transformations. Among these, the coupling reaction uniting of two or more polymer seg ments through a uniting agent, to yield a polymer of molecular weight nPM, wherein PM is the molecular weight of the polymer segment, and n is the functionality of the uniting agent is certainly one of the most inves tigated ones in that it allows, by a simple approach, outstanding changes to be obtained also in terms of the properties of treated polymers. As an example, in the case of diene polymerization, it is possible by so doing to increase Mooney viscosity, to reduce cold flow, to increase green tensile strength and also to be able to modify the molecular weight dis tribution as desired. In the case then of block polymers constituted by straight or branched links of A B elements wherein A is an aromatic polyvinyl and or polyisopropenyl sequence and B is a diene sequence, which may also be hydrogenat ed , the use of efficient coupling agents becomes a fac tor of basic importance in that, as it is well known, the presence in the end product of possibly unreacted AB products impairs the technological properties there of. In the technical literature several examples of coupling agents are reported H.L. Hsieh, Rubber Chem. and Techn. 49 5 , 1305 1976 . We have now discovered that the compound which is exemplified hereinunder can be conveniently used as a coupling agent in that, in addition to the typical properties of the best coupling agents described in tech nical papers see H.L. Hsieh, The product which has been found by us to be an effective coupling agent has the following formula Nonlimiting examples of alcohol compounds syn thetized by cyclooligomerization are 1,2,4,6 tetra 1 hydroxy 1 methylethyl cyclo octatetra ene, 1,2,4,7 tetra 1 hydroxy 1 methylethyl cyclo octa tetra ene, 1,3,5 tri 1 hydroxy 1 methylethyl benzene and 1,3,5,7 tetra 1 hydroxy 1 methylethyl cyclo octa tetra ene, which, by dehydration, respectively lead to 5,7 di isopropenyl 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl 1H,3H ciclo octa c furan 5,8 di isopropenyl 1,1,3,3 tetrameth yl 1H,3H cyclo octa c furan 1,3,5 tri isoprop enylbenzene and 1,3,5,7 tetra isopropenyl cyclo octatetraene, 1.3.5. tri isopropenylbenzene being of special in terest here. The compound which is the object of the present patent application can be used in processes for the po lymerization of monomers susceptible of anionic initia tion under living conditions and in particular for the polymerization of diene and or vynilaromatic monomers. The conjugated dienes used contain from 4 to 12 car bon atoms, and preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms. Such monomers comprise 1,3 butadiene, isoprene, 2,3 dimethyl butadiene, piperylene, 3 butyl 1,3 octa diene and 2 phenyl 1,3 butadiene. The vinylaromatic monomers contain from 8 to 20 car bon atoms and preferably from 8 to 14 carbon atoms. Typ ical examples are styrene, a methylstyrene, 1 vinyl naphtalene, 2 vinylnaphtalene, 2 isopropenyl naphtalene, p phenyl styrene, 3 methyl styrene, a methyl p methyl styrene, and p cyclohexylstyrene. The conjugated dienes and or vinylaromatic monomers may be polymerized singly or as mixtures, or sequential ly to form homopolymers, random copolymers and block copolymers. The polymerization is carried out in solution, at temperatures comprised between 100 and 200 C and pre ferably between 0 and 110 C and under a pressure which is the pressure of the system under the used temperature conditions, but no contrary directions exist against higher or lower pressures. Suitable solvents comprise paraffinic, cycloparaf finic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Typical examples are cyclohexane, hexane, pentane, heptane, isooctane, benzene, toluene and mixtures thereof. It is known that small amounts of polar compounds may be added to the solvent to the purpose of obtain ing, in the polymerization of the diene monomer, a 1,2 configuration, or in order to increase the efficiency of the initiator in case of polymerization of vinylaromatic monomers. The initiators are the typical anionic initiators used to this purpose. Preferably, the organometallic compounds of formu la R Me are used, wherein R is an aliphatic, cycloali phatic or aromatic hydrocarbon radical and Me is an al kali metal, preferably lithium. The amount of initiator used is a function of the polymer molecular weight which one wants to obtain. The polymerization is carried out under such conditions, as to secure the living characteristics of the polymer ob tained M. Szwarc, Carbanions, Living Polymers and El. Transfer Processes, Interscience Publishers J. Wiley Sons. New York 1968 . The coupling agent may be introduced into the reac tion medium in any way, either as a single adding, or as a plurality of partial additions, and at the time wanted. It is preferably introduced at the end of the polymeriz ation in the desired amount. The molar amount of coupling agent m The amount of coupling agent which is used conditions the coupling yields obviously, a stoichiometric ratio between the polymer active centre and the coupling agent centre taking into account its functionality favours the highest yield. The temperature at which the coupling reaction is carried out depends on the type of agent used, on the type of polymer undergoing the reaction and on the other pa rameters, e.g., on the reaction medium it can generally vary from 50 to 150 C, but is preferably comprised bet ween 60 and 120 C. The contact times are comprised within the range of from some minutes to some hours times of from 10 minutes to 2 hours are preferably used. Sometimes also polar activators may be used, which increase the coupling rate in the case for the more ac tive coupling compounds herein claimed, the use of such activators is not required. The solvents are those used in the polymerization. The coupling reaction is carried out under a pres sure which is the pressure of the system at working tem perature, but higher or lower pressures can be used as well. Polymerization and coupling are carried out in a In the order given, 500 ml of anhydrous cyclohexane, 12 g of styrene and 1.5 mmol of Li sec.butyl are charged, polymerization being allowed to proceed for about 1 hour at 60 C. On completion, 30 g of butadiene are added and polymerization is completed at 60 c in about one hour. An extremely small fraction of this polymer is isolated and sent to different analyses. Subsequently, 0,45 mmol of a solution of 1,3,5 tri isopropenylbenzene in cyclohexane is injected at 105 C during 30 minutes. Thereafter, the polymer solution, to which 1 g of an antioxidant had been added, is coagu lated with an excess of methanol, and the resultant polymer is vacuum dried at 60 C for 15 hours. The polymers A B and A B A with the properties repor ted in the Table hereinafter are isolated. The A B A polymer of Example 1 shows the following technological properties Elongation 900 Tensile strength 26 MPa. whereas the corresponding A B polymer, at the same elon gation shows a tensile strength of about 3 MPa.
