# Production of coating films from autoxidisable materials and coating compositions capable of producing such films.

## Abstract
Coating films are prepared by exposing to oxygen, particularly at ambient temperatures, a composition com prising a a film forming material comprising moieties of an ethylenically unsaturated fatty acid containing at least two ethylenically unsaturated groups and b a strong acid which is fully dissociated in water. Suitable film form ing materials are oil modified alkyd resins and suitable acids are alkyl aryl sulphonic acids. Curable compositions and polymeric products, optionally modified with non autoxidisable polymerisable materials, are also provided.
