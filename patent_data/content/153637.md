# Gas insulated electromagnetic induction appliance.

## Abstract
A gas insulated electromagnetic induction appliance in which a non condensing insulating gas and a condensing insulating coolant are confined, comprises a a pressure detector 13 for detecting a pressure within the container vessel 1 b a gas reservoir 7 connected to the container vessel 1 through a gas discharging passageway including a pipe line, a first gas valve 10 , a compressor 9 , and a gas diffuser 12 a gas feeding passageway including a pipe line and a second gas valve 14 and a liquid feeding passage way including a pipe line and a liquid valve 11 c a definite quantity of insulating coolant 3A confined in the gas reservoir 7 d a liquid surface detector 8 for detecting a quantity of the insulating coolant in the gas reservoir 7 and e control means 20 which controls the gas valve 10 , the liquid valve 11 , and the compressor 9 to thereby regulate a pressure in the container vessel 1 and a quantity of the liquid in the gas reservoir 7 .
