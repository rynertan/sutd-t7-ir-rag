# Ethoxylated amine oxides having clay soil removal anti redeposition properties useful in detergent compositions.

## Abstract
Water soluble ethoxylated amine oxides having clay soil removal anti redeposition properties are disclosed herein. These amine oxides are selected from ethoxylated monoamine oxides, ethoxylated diamine oxides, ethoxy lated polyamine oxides, ethoxylated amine oxide polymers, and mixtures thereof. These amine oxides are useful at from about 0.05 to about 95 by weight in detergent composi tions which further comprise from about 1 to about 75 by weight of a nonionic, anionic, ampholytic, zwitterionic, or cationic detergent surfactant or mixture thereof. In addition to these detergent surfactants, the detergent composition can optionally comprise from 0 to about 80 by weight of a detergent builder.
