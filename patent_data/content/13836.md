## Description
ACRYLIC EMULSION COPOLYMERS, COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM AND THEIR USE AS THICKENERS This invention relates to emulsion copolymers useful for the thickening of a variety of aqueous systems, to methods of thickening utilizing the copolymers, to enhancement of such thickening by the addition of surfactants, and to other aspects including coating compositions and other aqueous systems thickened with the copolymers. Salts of polyacrylic acid and polymethacrylic acid are well known as thickeners for various aqueous systems.A polyacrylic acid obtained by copolymerizing acrylic acid with a small amount about 0.2 to 1 by weight on the weight of acrylic acid of diallyl sucrose U.S. Pat.2,798,053 has also been sold for use as a thickener for many years. These thickening agents are difficult to handle because they are either powders that are slow to dissolve or very viscous aqueous solutions.Adverse effects such as stiffness or water sensitivity also may be imparted to the finished product by the polymeric acid thickener Still another problem associated with the acid thickeners is their electrolyte sensitivity. The aqueous systems thickened with these thickeners decrease drastically in viscosity upon addition of an electrolyte, such as sodium chloride. British patent 870,994 discloses the preparation of aqueous emulsion copolymers of methacrylic acid and a lower C1 C4 alkyl acrylate which gives good thickening upon neutralization. The copolymer a ispersions having a solids concentration o 25 to 50 by weight, are low viscosity fluids and are thus readily added directly to systems to be thickened. Eowever, they also have severe electrolyte sensitivity. These polyelectrolyte polymers are useful as bodying and suspending agents in various mucilaginous and colloidal gel like applications such as dentrifices , surgicaI jellies, creams and ointments, printing paste thickeners, and the like. However, most polyelectrolyte solutions decrease drastically in viscosity upon the addition of electrolytes such as sodium chloride. These prior art thickener materials are ion sensitive and do not adequately maintain the viscosities of water or organic solvent solutions containing inorganic salts such as sodium chloride even when a third monomer such as 2 ethylhexylacrylate or styrene respectively is included in the polymer as is suggested by the respective prior art patents. U.S. Patent 4,138,381 discloses at column 2, lines 7 to 41, and column 12, claim 1, lines 2 to 43, a composition as follows WA liquid composition useful as a thickening agent in.polymeric latices, the composition comprising A up to 50 , by weight of the composition, of a polymer of polymerized units of I about by weight of the polymers, at least one unsaturated carboxylic acid of 3 d carbon atoms 2 about 1 50 , by weight of the polymer, at least one alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 30 carbon atoms and 3 about 1 85 , by weight of the polymer, at least one ester of the formulaEMI3.1 where R and R2 are hydrogen or methyl is is an alkyl radicaL or an alkyl phenol radical of 1 20 carbon atoms is 5 80 and y is 0 20 the total of 1, 2 and 3 being. I006 and B as a solvent for A 4 a glycol, or 5 a glycol containing up to 50 of its weight of water the composition being made by a adding 10 50 , by weight of the total weight of monomers to be used, to a reaction vessel containing enough glycol, or glycol containing up to 50 of its weight of water, to give a final polymer concentration of less than 50 by weight b heating the contents of the vessel to at least 50 C. c adding a portion of the free radical catalyst to be used to the vessel and then d continuously adding the remainder of the monomers and catalyst to the vessel, and e adding ammonia or a water soluble organic amine after the polymeriza tion is complete to adjust the pH to about 7 to 10, Column 12, claim 1, lines 2 to 43 . In accordance with the present invention, stable aqueous dispersions of certain water insoluble, emulsion copolymers of methacrylic acid MAA are produced which are quite fluid at a pB below about 7 even though they have solids contents of 25 to 508 or even higher, but upon partial or substantial neutralization with ammonium hydroxide or an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium, potassium, or lithium hydroxide, or a volatile amine, such as triethylamine or triethanol amine, become highly viscous and are suitable for thickening aqueous media of a wide variety, using the same general procedure disclosed in the British patent mentioned above.As compared to the thickeners of theBritish patent, those copolymer thickeners of the present invention containing the polymerized units of meth acrylic acid ester of a C8 C30 alkyl, alkylaryl, or polycyclic alkyl mono ether of a polyethylene glyol defined herein generally provide markedly greater viscosity at given levels, and have one or more advantages, such as less sensitivity to electrolyte content of the aqueous medium thickened also improved flow and leveling when used as a rheology modifier in latex coating compositions such as water base paints, in pigment printing pastes for coloring of textiles the use of thickeners of the present invention is quite advantageous in respect to ease of formulation, compatability with a wide variety of pigment binders and pigment dispersions, high thickening efficiency resulting in brilliant coloration, good color yield and sharp demarkation, freedom from flushing and haloing, minimal stiffening of the printed area, resistance to crocking, to washing, to dryecleaning, and to exposure to sunlight. In all aqueous silk screen pigment printing systems, the thickeners of the present invention provide convenience of handling, good color depth, sharp mark detail with no haloing, and improved holdout , i.e. less strikethrough . The novel and improved copolymer dispersions of the present invention are those obtainable by aqueous emulsion copolymerization of monomers falling within the following three of four classes 1 methacrylic acid or acrylic acid sometimes hereinafter referred to as MAA, or AA, respectively 2 an acrylic of methacrylic acid ester of a C8 C30 alkyl, alkylaryl, or polycyclic hydrocarbyl monoether of a polyethylene glycol having at least 2 oxyethylene units therein, preferably having at least 10 to 40 or more up to 70 or so oxyethylene units. This monomer may be defined by the general formula H2C C R C o o CH,CH,O , RO I wherein R is H or CH3, the latter being preferred, n is at least 2, and preferably has an average value of at least 10, up to 40 to 60 or even up to 70 or so, in the case of a single compound n is an integer having the specified value, in the case of a mixture of compounds n is an average number , and RO is a hydrophobic group, for example, an alkyl, alkylaryl, and polycyclic alkyl group having 8 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 24, such as 12 to 20, more preferably 16 to 18 carbon atoms7 such as 12 to 18. RO represents a single radical or a mixture of radicals having an average number of carbon atoms in the specified ranges. 3 A Cl C4 alkyl acrylate or alkyl methacrylate, preferably ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate, sometimes referred to hereinafter as EA , BA , or MMA , respec tively, most preferably EA, and 4 Optionally, a small amount of a polyethylen ically unsaturated monomer. In general, the emulsion copolymer dispersions obtained have solids contents of from 25 to 50 by weight and the three component copolymer dispersion has a weight average molecular weight of about 100,000 to several million. A chain transfer agent may be used to obtain molecular weights in the lower part of the range or even down to about 80,000. On the other hand, use of 0.05 to about 1.0 of monomer component 4 , based on total monomers, serves to provide molecular weights in or above the higher portion of the range mentioned. The relative proportions of the first three components fall in the broad range of 1 20 69.5 weight percent, 2 0 .5 to 25 weight percent, and 3 at least 30 weight percent, the total percentages of the three camonerts being 100. The preferred ranges are 1 20 50 , more preferaly 30 50 , such as 35 45, most preferably 30 45 , 2 2 25 , such as 5 15 , more preferably 1 15 , 3 at least 40 , 0 more preferably 40 60 .In component 2 R may be octyl C8 , lauryl C12 , tridecyl C13 , myristyl C14 , or pentadecyl C15 , but is is preferably C12 to C18 or mixtures thereof, examples being lauryl, cetyl, palmityl, and stearyl. RO may be longer chain alkyl groups, such as eicosyl C20 . RO may be alkylaryl, such as octyl and vinylphenyl, or polycyclic alkyl such as cholesterol and lanosterol. A mixture of several C8 C30 alkyl ethers may be used. The emulsion copolymers of the present invention may be produced by conventional aqueous emulsion polymerization techniques, using appropriate emulsifiers for emulsifying the monomer and for maintaining the polymer obtained in a stable, dispersed condition.Commonly used anionic surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, dodecylbenzene sulfonate and ethoxylated fatty alcohol sulfate can be used as emulsifiers. The emulsifier may be used in a proportion of 1 2 to 6 of the weight of monomers. Preferably, water soluble initiators such as alkali metal or ammonium persulf ate are used in amounts from 0.01 to 1.0 on the weight of monomers. A gradual addition thermal process employed at temperatures between 6Q0C to 1000 is preferred over redox system for better incorporation of the hydrophobe containing monomer component 2 . The polymerization system may contain small amounts 0.01 to 1 by weight, based on monomer weight of the chain transfer agent mercaptans such as alkyl mercaptans containing from about 4 to 22 carbon atoms. The use of mercaptan modifier reduces the molecular weight of the polymer and therefore its thickening efficiency. This may be desirable in certain areas of applications where proper rheology but not the thickening efficiency is of primary concern. The copolymers hereinabove defined may further be modified by introducing a small amount of component 4 , namely, a polyethylenically unsaturated copolymerizable monomer effective for crosslinking, such as diallylphthalate, divinylbenzene, ailyl methacrylate, or ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate. Thus, from 0.05 to 1.0 of such polyethylenically unsaturated compound based on total weight of monomer may be included in the composition forming the polymer. The resulting copolymers are either highly branched or in the form of three dimensional networks.. In the neutralized salt form, those networks swell in an aqueous system and the consequent micro geL structure acts as a highly efficient thickener. The copolymer may be utilized in a variety of ways to provide the thickener or thickened compositions of the invention. For example, the copolymer, while in aqueous dispersion. or dry form , may be blended into an aqueous system to be thickened followed by addition of a neutralizing agent. AIternatively, the copolymer may first be neutrali zed in aqueous dispersion form and then blended with the aqueous system Preferably, if cothickening by a surfactant is desired,. the components are separately blended as dry components or as dispersions or scurries into an aqueous dispersion to be thickened, followed by the neutralization step. Although aqueous concentrates of the copolymer in acid form and the surfactant may be formed and added to an aqueous dispersion to be thickened as needed, followed by neutralizationr such concentrates tend to be too viscous for easy handling. It is nevertheless possible to prepare either a. dry blend or an aqueous, high solids composition which is sufficiently low in viscosity as to be pumpable or pourable, and then to further thicken the admixture by addition of an alkaline material. The copolymer thickener may be provided in a dry state in a number of ways. For example, the unneutralized copolymer may be spray or drum dried and, if desired, blended. with a surfactant cothickener.However, it is also possible to spray dry or otherwise dehydrate the neutralized copolymer thickenerr and then reconstitute the aqueous thickener dispersion at a future time and place by agitation in an aqueous medium, provided the pE of the dispersion is maintained at pE 7 or higher. The more usual method of application of the dispersion of the present invention for aqueous thickening is to add the aqueous dispersion of the carboxylic acid copolymer to the medium to be thickened and,. after mixing, to introduce an alkaline material to neutralize the acid The major portion of the thickening effect is obtained in a few minutes upon neutralization. In the presence of high concentrations of electrolytes, the viscosity development may take much longer. This method of applying a copolymer emulsion to an aqueous system before neutralization enables one to handle a high solids thickener in a non viscous state, t obtain a uniform blend, and then to convert to a highly viscous condition by the simple addition. of and alkaline material to bring the pH of the system to 7 or above. he aqueous aqueous solutions thickened with the neutralized latex copolymer of this invention exhibit good viscosity stabiIity even at pE as high as 13. The thickeners described here are useful in a variety of aqueous systems such as textile printing pastes, latex paint formulations, and cosmetic formulations. A remarkable enhancement of thickening herein termed cothickening has been observed upon the addition of a surfactant to an aqueous system containing the emulsion copolymer of the invention, when the emulsion copolymer is neutralized. In some cases the thickening can be enhanced up to about 40 times the viscosity afforded by the neutralized copolymer alone. A wide range of surfactant type and amount is effective.Generally, the surfactant may be used in an amount of about 0.01 to 5 parts by weight of surfactant per part of copolymer solids, preferably 0.05 to 1.0 parts by weight of surfactant per part copolymer solids, and most preferably 0.1 to 0.5 parts surfactant per part copolymer, same basis.Although trace amounts of surfactant may be residually present from the emulsion polymerization of the monomers comprising the emulsion copolymer for example, whatever may remain of the about I.5 wt . surf actant on monomers , such amounts of surfactant are not believed to result in any measurable cothickening . On the basis of an aqueous system containing about 0.1. to 56 by weight of copolymer solids, a useful amount of surfactant for optimum cothickening is about O..1 to 1.0 by weight of the total system.As indicated, the amounts of copolymers and surfactant cothickener may vary widely, even outside these ranges, depending on copolymer and surfactant type and other components of the aqueous system to be thickened. However, it has been observed that the cothickening reaches a maximum as surfactant is added and then decreases. Hence, it may be uneconomical to employ surfactant in amounts outside the stated concentrations and copolymer surfactant ratios but this can be determined in a routine manner in each case The preferred method of application of the emulsion copolymer and the surfactant for aqueous thickening is to add in any sequence the copolymer and the surfactant to the medium to be thickened and, after mixing, to introduce an alkaline material to neutralize the acid.This method of applying copolymer emulsion and surfactant to an aqueous system before neutralization enables one to handle a high solids thickener in a non viscous state, to obtain a uniform blend, and then to convert to a highly viscous condition by the simple addition of an alkaline material to bring the pE of the system to 7 or above. However, the copolymer in the aqueous system may also be neutralized before addition of the surfactant. The surfactants which may be used include nonionics and anionics, singly or in combination, the selection necessarily depending upon compatibility with other ingredients of the thickened or thickenable dispersions of the invention Cationic and amphoteric surfactants may also be used provided they are compatible with the copolymer and other ingredients of the aqueous system, or are used in such small amounts as not to cause incompatibility. Suitable anionic surfactants that may be used include the higher fatty alcohol sulfates such as the sodium or potassium salt of the sulfates of alcohols having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms, alkali metal salts or amine salts of higher fatty acid having 8 to 18 carbon atoms, and sulfonated alkyl aryl compounds such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate. Examples of nonionic surfactants include alkylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols having alkyl groups of about 7 to 18 carbon atoms and about 9 to 40 or more oxyethylene units such as octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols, dodecylphenoxypolyethoxyethanols ethylene oxide derivatives of long chain carboxylic acids, such as lauric, myristic, palmitic, oleic ethylene oxide condensates of long chain alcohols such as lauryl or cetyl alcohol, and the like. Examples of cationic surf actants include lauryl pyridinium chloride, octylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, condensates of primary fatty amines and ethylene oxide, and the like. Amphoteric surfactants include cocoa beta alanine, methyl ester of dimethyl octadecyl betaine chloride, and quaternary amine derivatives of fatty acids, such as cetyldimethylammonium inner carboxylate, and the like. The foregoing and numerous other useful nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric surfactants are described in the literature, such as McCutcheon sDetergents h Emulsifiers 1978 Annual, North AmericaEdition , MC Publishing Company, Glen Rock, NJ 07452U.S.A., incorporated herein by reference. A remarkable enhancement of flow and leveling properties associated with the use of the thickeners whereby high film build aqueous coatings are obtained has been observed. This characteristic permits the use of the thickeners of the invention as rheology modifiers in latex coating compositions such as water base paints. A difficult problem heretofore encountered in designing aqueous coatings having desirable flow and film build properties has been the want of an efficient thickener having low pseudoplasticity which is manifest in a workable low shear viscosity in the range of about 70 to 100 Krebs Units . KU and, concommitantly, a sufficient high shear viscosity measured by an ICI cone and plate viscometer in the range of about 1.2 to 2.5 or more poise thereby providing brush drag and film build. Thickeners known in the prior art, while suitable for some applications of coating compositions in which they are contained, offer.advantages in certain of the following properties while sacrificing others of the same group of properties thickening efficiency that is, minimization of attrition of film resistance , low pseudoplasticity only slight shear thinning , reasonable expense, phase separations, high ICI viscosity values when used at low levels, sensitivity to electrolytes and charged particles in solution. The use of low levels of the thickeners of the invention overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art compositions and provides thickener compositions which offers a high advantageous balance of thickening efficiency and low pseudoplasticity. For use as a rheology modifier for aqueous coating compositions, low levels, from about 0.5 to 5 by weight, of hydrophobe containing monomer, H2C C R C O O CH2CH20 RO, represented hereinabove as of general formula I, contains 8 to 14 carbon atoms, are employed in producing the thickener copolymers used in the compositions of the invention. Preferably, from about 1 to 5 by weight of the hydrophobe containing comonomer is used. Most preferably, about 3 by weight of the hydrophobe containing monomer wherein RO is a C12 alkyl group is employed. Thus, in addition to the emulsion copolymer described above, the invention provides a composition comprising the copolymer and at least one surfactant, preferably in an amount, by weight, of from 0.01 to 5 parts per part of the copolymer. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of thickening an aqueous system which comprises providing in the system at least partially neutralized copolymer of the invention and, optionally, at least one surfactant. In the following examples illustrative of the invention, the parts and percentages are by weight and the temperatures are in Celsius degrees unless otherwise stated. The following Example A is a suitable procedure for producing the acrylic acid and the methacrylic acid ester constituting component 2 but other ways may be employed such as transesterification of a monomeric alkyl acrylate or methacrylate, illustrated by the following Example B, such as ethyl acrylate or methyl methacrylate, with the C8 C24 alkyloxy polyethoxy ethanol.Example A A reactor equipped with a condenser and a Dean Stark trap is charged with 2140 g of an octadecyloxypoly ethyleneoxy ethanol containing an average of 20 oxyethylene units, 207 g of methacrylic acid, 1000 g of toluene, 17.4 g of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 4.6 g of monomethylether of hydroquinone. The mixture is stirred and heated to reflux. The water, formed during the esterification, is removed as water toluene azeotrope with toluene returned to the reactor. The reaction is carried out in contact with air to inhibit polymerization.When no more water is distilled, the mixture is cooled, neutralized with sodium carbonate, filtered, and solvent is stripped to give octadecyloxypoly ethyleneoxy ethyl methacrylate as a tan waxy solid.

The resulting composition is useful as a clear concentrate that can be diluted with about 95 to 98 parts of water to form a printing clear.Such a clear can then be mixed with an aqueous emulsion polymer to serve as a binder and, if desired, with a color concentrate. The commercial practice to date has been to prepare water in oil types of clear concentrates commonly used for the textile printing and dyeing industry by mixing a dusty, powdered thickener, such as certain dry products of U.S. patent 2,798,053 with the other ingredients.The use of polycarboxylic acid thickeners in the form of aqueous emulsion polymer dispersions for preparation of printing compositions for the textile printing and dyeing industry, though suggested in theBritish patent page 6, lines 58 to 70 , has not been accepted commercially, presumably because of inadequate thickening efficiency obtained by the use of such emulsion polymer dispersions and or the lack of reliable viscosity expectations in the event of adventitious presence of cations, such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, which may be present in hard water used or in the case of sodium, present in a softened water in an amount that varies in dependence upon variation in the hardness of the water treated or upon unreliable deionization.The possibility of adventitious occurrence of such cations, especially that of sodium is particularly rampant in the commercially available pigment or color concentrates.The acid emulsion copolymers of the present invention provide a more efficient thickening effect and are less sensitive to the presence, adventitiously or otherwise, of such cations. The polycarboxylic acid emulsion copolymers of the present invention not only have exceptional thickening efficiency as compared to those of the British patent, but it has been found that tey are less sensitive to sodium ions, such as may occur in various small amounts adventitiously in the clear and color concentrates commonly used in the textile printing industry.Example 8 a A printing clear is prepared by dissolving sorbitan monooleate 0.06 part in mineral spirits 1.45 parts , mixing therewith 2.5 parts of Polymer BC TableVI at 30 solids, 95.49 parts of water and 0.5 part of aqueous 28 ammonium hydroxide. b Eighty parts of the clear obtained in part a is mixed with 10 parts of a binder consisting of a 35 solids aqueous dispersion of an .Crt 1iC emulsion polymer having a heat reactive component, such as an H methyloltmetn acrylamide copolymerized therein to enable curing by heat of the composition after application to a textile fabric. This printing clear having no colorant therein is designated A. c Additional printing pastes are prepared by mixing 90 parts of the clear obtained in part a with 10 parts of the same 35 solids binder as in part b but in one paste 3 parts of the commercially available color concentrate Aqua Hue Blue BGG 9521 is mixed in yielding a paste herein designated C, whereas in another 10 parts ofAqua Hue Blue BOG 9521 is mixed in, yielding a paste herein designated D. d The Brookfield Viscosity of the three compositions, A, C, D, are measured at 23.9 C 750F using spindle No. 6 at 20 rpm with the following results A 19,500 mNsm 2 C 32,000 mNsm 2 D 46,000 mNsm 2 e A commercially available clear concentrate is prepared by mixing 15 parts of a powdery polycarboxylic acid copolymer, such as is disclosed in U.S. patent 2,798,053, into a solution of 5 parts sorbitan monooleate in 30 parts of mineral spirits, adding a mixture of about 38.5 parts of water and 7.5 parts of 28 ammonium hydroxide, and finally about 4 parts of a nonionic toil in water surf actant, such as nonylphenoxypoly 9 ethoxyethanol. Three parts of the clear concentrate is mixed with 97 parts of water to provide a printing clear which is termed herein a 3 commercial clear or CC 38 for simplicity . f The wCC 3 is mixed with the same 35 solids binder as is used in part b in the relative proportions of 80 parts of the former with 10 parts of the binder to produce a printing clear. g Then additional printing pastes are prepared by adding 3 parts, in one instance, and 10 parts in another instance, of the same blue color concentrate, qua Blue Blue BGG 9521 used in part c to 90 parts of the printing clear obtained in part f . Brookfield viscosities of the clear and of the two pastes having corresponding levels of blue as in the clear A of part b and in pastes C and D of part c herein are shown in the following table A, C, and D are used in this table to indicate level of blue colorant .

The clear and colored pastes obtained in parts b , c , f , g and h of this example are applied to textile fabrics by the screen printing process and then cured by heating in conventional ovens. Along with ncreased viscosity when the color is added in increasing proportions, the printed textile shows a greater sharpness of the mark, reduction of, or even freedom from flushing and haloing, and better print hold out with resulting brighter and deeper shade and softer hand.Example 9 Pigment pastes are prepared using various color concentrates from the printing clear A obtained in accordance with Examples 8 b .

The results shown in Table XV demonstrate that the emulsion polymerization process according to the invention produces considerably more effective copolymer thickener having much higher molecular weights than those obtained by the solution polymerization process of U.S. Patent 4,138,381. Moreover, the data demonstrate that copolymer prepared by the propylene glycol solvent polymerization process of U.S. Patent 4,138,381 may not be conveniently prepared by the emulsion polymerization process employed in the present invention. Example 20 This example illustrates the thickening efficiency of two aqueous emulsion copolymer thickeners based on acrylic acid esters of polyethoxylated fatty alcohols according to the present invention.
