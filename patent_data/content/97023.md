## Description
DESCRIPTION PROSTAGLANDIN D DERIVATIVES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM The present invention relates to novel prostaglandin D derivatives, to processes for their production and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Prostaglandins are derivatives of prostanoic acid having the following structure EMI1.1 Various types of prostaglandins are knownt and their types depend on the structure of the alicyclic ring and the substituents. For example, the alicyclic rings of prostaglandin F PGF , E PGE and D PGD have the following structures, respectively EMI1.2 In the above structural formulae or in the other structural formulae in this specification, according to the generally accepted nomenclature, the broken line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is behind the ring plane, i.e. is of the a configuration, the bold line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is in front of the ring plane, i.e. is of the ss configuration, and the wavy line indicates that the substituent attached thereto is of the a configuration or the ss configuration or a mixture thereof. These compounds are sub classified according to the positions of the double bonds in the side chains attached to the alicyclic ring at the 8 position and the 12 position. The PG 1 compound has a trans double bond trans 13 between C13 C14 and the PG 2 compound has a cis double bond between C5 C6 and a trans double bond between C13 C14 cis A5 trans A13 .For example, prostaglandin D1 PGD1 and prostaglandin D2 PGD2 may be expressed by the following structural formulae respectively EMI2.1 andEMI3.1 Further, when one or more methylene groups are removed from the aliphatic group attached at the 12position of the alicyclic ring of a prostaglandin, said compound is known as a nor prostaglandin according to the general rule of the organic nomenclature, and the number of the removed methylene groups is indicated by adding di , tri etc. before the prefix nor . The prostaglandins generally have pharmacological properties. For example, they exert various effects, including the stimulation of contraction of smooth muscles, a hypotensive effect, a diuretic effect, a bronchial dilation effect, the inhibition of lypolysis, the inhibition of platelet aggregation and the inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Therefore, they are useful in treatments of hypertension, thrombosis, asthma and gastric and intestinal ulcers, in the induction of labor and abortion in pregnant mammals, in the prevention of arteriosclerosis and also as diuretics. They are liposoluble substances present in extremely small quantities in the tissues which secrete prostaglandins in vivo in animals. As a result of research and experimentation to discover novel compounds which have the pharmacological effects of the natural prostaglandins, or which have one or more of these properties to an enhanced degree, or which have properties which are not found in the natural prostaglandins, it has been discovered that novel compounds in which the hydroxy group attached at the 9 position and the hydrogen atom attached at the 10 position of PGD1 and PGD2 have been removed to introduce a cis double bond between C9 C10 9 deoxy A9 PGD analogues and related novel compounds in which, in addition, the hydroxy group attached to the 15 position has been removed to introduce double bonds between theC12 C13 and C14 C15 positions have a surprisingly strong anti tumour effect whereas they have no or very weak pharmacological properties possessed by the natural prostaglandins. The fact that PGD2 inhibits the proliferation of cancerized mast cells has already been made public see Proceedings of the Japanese Cancer Association, the 40th Annual Meeting published on September 5, 1981 .However, the anti tumour effect of compounds of the present invention which are structurally distinguished from PGD2 has been found to be superior by several times as compared with that of PGD2 whereas in other PG like properties compounds of the present invention are several times less active than PGD2. The compounds of the invention tested therefore exert an anti tumour effect which is selective in relation to the other effects, a particularly advantageous selective action compared with PGD2. Heretofore, there have been filed several patent applications relating to 9 deoxy 9 PGD analogues. 9For example, there are disclosed 9 deoxy A PGD2 and alkyl esters thereof in the specification of the UnitedStates Patent No. 3954844 Derwent No. 37947X compounds wherein various substituents have been introduced into the aliphatic group attached to the 12 position are described in the specification of the United States PatentNo. 4016184 Derwent No. 24680Y , and further compounds in which the carboxyl group at the 1 position of the 9 deoxy 9 PGD analogues have been replaced by a hydroxymethyl group are described in the specifications of the United States Patent Nos. 4028419 Derwent No. 43349Y , 4055602 Derwent No. 48794Y and 4032576 Derwent No.48793Y . However, none of the above applications discloses the compounds of the present invention. Compounds of the invention which have double bonds between C12 C13 and C14 C15 are also novel compounds having such a structure have not heretofore been discovered. Furthermore, in addition to their structural differences from known PGD compounds, the novel compounds of the present invention have an effect which has not hitherto been found in the known 9 deoxy 9 PGD analogues that is, an anti tumour effect. The above described UnitedStates Patent specifications describe only the pharmacological properties known with the natural prostaglandins and none of the applications refers to an anti tumour effect.

The products of steps a , b and c may be used without purification, in subsequent steps. The step d may be conducted by selectively acylating or silylating the hydroxy group attached to the ll position of the compound of the general formula X . Such acylation may be conducted using an appropriate acyl chloride or acid anhydride, for example, benzoyl chloride, in an inert organic solvent, for example, methylene chloride, or in the absence of a solvent in the presence of a tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine at a temperature not higher than room temperature, preferably at 30 to 400C.A suitable silylation procedure is described in detail in Protective Groups in OrganicSynthesis published by John Wiley Sons, Inc.

If desired, esters of the general formulae XIV and XV may be converted into the corresponding acids by the method 1 described above for deacylation. The step h is an oxidation reaction to convert the ll hydroxy group in the compounds of general formulae XIV and XV into an oxo group and, in addition to eliminate the group OR12 in the compound of general formula XV to from a double bond between Cg Cl0. Such an oxidation reaction is well known, and is described in detail in, for example, a Synthetic Organic Chemistry III, Organic Synthesis 1 , pp. 176 206 compiled by Tetsuji Kameya and published byNankodo Japan on Aug. 1, 1976 or b Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods , vol. 1, vol. 2, and vol. 3, section 48 or 168 published by JohnWiley Sons, Inc.

Cyclodextrin clathrates of the compounds of general formulae I and II can be prepared by dissolving the cyclodextrin in water or a water miscible organic solvent, and adding to the solution the prostaglandin derivative in a water miscible organic solvent. The mixture is then heated and the desired cyclodextrin clathrate is isolated from the resulting solution by concentrating the mixture under reduced pressure, or by cooling and separating the product by filtration or decantation. The ratio of organic solvent to water may be varied according to the solubilities of the starting materials and products. Preferably, the temperature is not allowed to exceed 700C during preparation of the cyclodextrin clathrate. a , ss or y Cyclodextrin, or mixtures thereof, may be used to prepare the cyclodextrin clathrates.Conversion into cyclodextrin clathrates serves to increase the stability of the prostaglandin derivatives of the general formulae I and II . The prostaglandin derivatives of general formula I or II wherein R represents a hydrogen atom may, if desired, be converted by known methods into salts. Preferably the salts are non toxic salts. By the term non toxic salts , as used in this specification, is meant salts the cations of which are relatively innocuous to the animal organism when used in therapeutic doses so that the beneficial pharmacological properties of the compounds of general formula I or II are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to those cations. Preferably the salts are water soluble.Suitable non toxic salts include the alkali metal, e.g. sodium or potassium, salts, the alkaline earth metal, e.g.calcium or magnesium, salts and ammonium salts, and pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. non toxic amine salts.Amines suitable for forming such salts with a carboxylic acid are well known and include, for example, amines derived in theory by the replacement of one or more of the hydrogen atoms of ammonia by groups, which may be the same or different when more than one hydrogen atom is replaced, selected from, for example a alkyl groups containing from I to 6 carbon atoms and hydroxyalkyl groups containing 2 or 3 carbon atoms.Suitable non toxic amine salts are, e.g., tetraalkylammonium, such as tetramethylartirnonium, salts, and other organic amine salts such as methylamine salts, ethylamine salts, isopropylamine salts, tert butylamine salts, dimethylamine salts, cyclopentylamine salts, benzylamine salts, phenethylamine salts a piperidine salts, monoethanolamine salts, diethanolamine salts, lysine salts or arginine salts. Salts may be prepared from the acids of general formula I or II wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, by known methods, for example by reaction of stoichiometric quantities of an acid of general formula I or 11 and the appropriate base, e.g. an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or carbonate, ammonium hydroxide, ammonia or an organic amine, in a suitable solvent. The salts may be isolated by lyophilisation of the solution or, if sufficiently insoluble in the reaction medium, by filtration, if necessary, after removal of part of the solvent. The prostaglandin D derivatives of the general formula I or II , and cyclodextrin clathrates thereof, and non toxic salts of the acids when R1 in the general formulae I and II represents a hydrogen atom either do not show the pharmacological effects typical of other prostaglandins, for example, hypotensive activity, inhibition of platelet aggregation, stimulation of uterine muscles and the production of diarrhoea or these effects are very weak. In contrast the anti tumour effect of the derivatives of general formula I and II is extremely strong and moreover their toxicity is extremely low. They may therefore be employed as very effective anti tumour agents in the prevention or therapy of leukemia and solid cancer, and in treatment to produce remission thereof. In a laboratory, in vitro test on the inhibition of proliferation of human myelogenous leukemic cells HL 60 the experimental method being described in detail below , the compound of the present invention, 5Z,9Z,14EZ ll oxoprosta 5,9,12,14 tetraenoic acid produced in Example 2 d inhibited the proliferation of the leukemic cells by 93.2 at a concentration of 5 pg ml. In contrast, PGD2 which is known to exert an anti tumour effect inhibited the proliferation of the leukemic cells by only 55.6 at a concentration of 5 pg ml in the same test. The test on the inhibition of the proliferation of human myelogenous leukemic cells was conducted by a well known method. The human myelogenous leukemic cells HL 60 were added to an RPMI culture solution containing 10 bovine fetal serum, the number of cells in the culture solution was adjusted to 1 x 105 cells ml, a solution in ethanol of the compound under test was added to give a concentration of 5g ml, and the mixture was subjected to stationary culture at 370C for 4 days. As a control, a culture solution containing 0.1 of ethanol was similarly cultured. The culture solutions were stained by the TrypanBlue staining method and the surviving cell number was measured to determine the degree of inhibition relative to the control. The results are given in the following Table.Table Inhibition of Proliferation Using Human Myelogenous Leukemic Cells Compound Surviving Degree of Cell Number Inhibition cells ml Control 44.0 x 104 5z,9z,14EZ 11 Oxoprosta 5,9,12,14 tetraenoic Acid 3 x 10 93.2 Compound of the Invention PGD2 Known Compound 19.5 x 104 55.6 With regard to the pharmacological effects typical of other prostaglandins, for example, in the intravenous administration to the allobarbital anesthetized dog, 5Z,9Z,14EZ oxoprosta 5,9,12,14 tetraenoic acid did not cause blood pressure depression at a dosage of 100 pg kg animal body weight, whereas PGD2 caused blood pressure depression by 26 mm Hg at a dosage of 10 gg kg animal body weight and its effect lasted for 6 minutes. The acute toxicity of the compounds of the present invention was 50 mg kg by intraperitoneal administration, so that the prostaglandin D derivatives of the present invention may be considered to be sufficiently safe and suitable for medical use. For example, theLD50 value for 5Z,9Z,14EZ ll oxoprosta 5,9,12,14 tetraenoic acid was 78 mg kg by intraperitoneal administration in mice.
