# METHOD OF VAPOR DEPOSITION

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of forming a deposit, such as silicon, by the reaction of a reactant, such as lithium, with a gas containing the element or compound to be deposited, such as silicon tetrachloride. One reactant diffuses through the growing scale on a heated inert substrate to react with the gas on the other side of the scale and lead to further scale growth.
