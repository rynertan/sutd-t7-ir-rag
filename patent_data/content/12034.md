# Variable frequency magnetron.

## Abstract
The microwave output frequency of a magnetron can be rapidly altered within a particular frequency band by chang ing the effective frequency of oscillation of a resonant cavity. In a co axial magnetron an annular cavity 1 is provided with a movable end plate 6 . The plate 6 is attached to a mechani cal resonator, which takes the form of a tuning fork 7 . Vibra tion of the tuning fork 7 causes a corresponding cyclic varia tion in the output frequency of the magnetron. Various con figurations in which tuning forks are mounted on a magnetron are illustrated.
