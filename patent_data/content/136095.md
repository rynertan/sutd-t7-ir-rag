# INK FOR PRINTERS WITH A SELECTIVE JET OF ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE INK

## Abstract
The ink comprises an aqueous mixture, rendered electri cally conductive by means of an electrolyte, with a pigment and possibly a soluble dye in ratios of concentration with respect to the mixture of between 4.5 and 9 of pigment and between 2 and 4 of dye. The electrolyte is added in an amount such as to give a resistivity of the ink of between 40 and 150 Ohm.cm. A wetting agent is moreover added to the mixture so as to give a viscosity of between 1.6 and 1.7 cSt.
