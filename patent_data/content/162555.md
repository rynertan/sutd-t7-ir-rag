# Production of metal strip.

## Abstract
A method of producing metallic strip containing discrete particles of one or more additional metallic or non metallic materials dispersed therein, includes the step of forming a homogeneous mix of ductile metallic particles and a minor proportion of metallic and or non metallic particles having chemical and or physical properties different from those of the ductile metallic particles. A slurry coating 2 comprising a suspension of the mixed particles in a film forming cellulose derivative is deposited onto a moving support surface 4 , dried and removed from the support surface before being subjected to rolling to effect compaction of the ductile content of the strip and sintering at a temperature at which the me tallic particles coalesce to form a matrix containing particles of the additional metallic or non metallic material s which either remain as discrete particles or alloy with the matrix.
