# GEL PLATE AND PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAME

## Abstract
A gel plate contains a polysaccharide and an aqueous solution of polyhydric alcohol. An intermediate gel plate product is prepared from an aqueous solution of polyhydric alcohol containing not more than 50 by weight of a poly saccharide dissolved therein, a ratio of water to polyhydric alcohol in the aqueous solution bein 95 5 to 40 60. The inter mediate gel plate product is processed to lower the ratio of water to polyhydric alcohol to a predetermined level to form the gel plate.
