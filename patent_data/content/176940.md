# Polysaccharides, methods for preparing such polysaccharides and fluids utilizing such polysaccharides.

## Abstract
Water soluble polysaccharides, including cellulose ethers, containg pendent vicinal dihydroxy structure capable of cis geometry, which upon crosslinking with a polyvalent metal have shear thermal stability characteristics of at least about 30 at 250 F., are useful in oilfield applications.
