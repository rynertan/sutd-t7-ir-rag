# Tracking robot apparatus.

## Abstract
A tracking robot apparatus has a robot for performing a predetermined operation, a movable device for moving an object of interest, a signal input device for designating operations of the robot and the movable device, an operation device for calculating an operation instruction value of the movable device in response to an input signal from the signal input device, a controller for driving the movable device in accordance with the calculated operation instruc tion value, an operation device for calculating a position posture instruction value to keep relative position and posture of the robot and the movable device unchanged upon operation of the movable device, and a controller for driving a robot in accordance with the calculated position posture instruction value. The movable device is operated in response to the signal from the signal input device, and at the same time the robot is operated such that the relative position and posture of the robot and the movable device are kept unchanged.
