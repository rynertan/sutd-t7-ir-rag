## Description
Improvement in or relating to the measurement of the water Content of Crude Oil. The present invention relates to tlle incasur lnell1 of the water content of crude oil. Crude oil extracted frown wells such as those in the NorthSea may contain water at collcellirati.olls which vary from a fraction of one percent to several percent As royalties are calculated on the basis of the net amount of oil transferred to the mainland, it is desirable to be able to establish the water content of the oil to a considerable accuracy The methods of measuring water content which are employed at the moment are not entirely satisfactory. The settling tank method is slow and inaccurate and requires the installation of large equipment which may be impracticable.Methods based on capacitance probes, although widely used are of doubtful accuracy in the long term due to the formation of deposits on the surfaces of the electrodes, Sampling methods are slow and mechanically complex and give rise to errors if the water is not fully mixed so that unrepresentation samples are obtained. According to the present invention there is provided a method of measuring the water content of crude oil comprising the operations of irradiating a sample of crude oil in a fixed geometry with a known dose of neutron, measuring the amount ofY ray activity arising from the interaction of the neutrons with either chlorine or oxygen present in the sample, deriving the specific activity of theY rays from the sample, and comparing the specific activity of theY rays from oxygen or chlorine in the sample with that arising from a known concentration of oxygen or chlorine in crude oil. Also according to the invention there is provided an apparatus for measuring tulle water content of crude oil, comprising means for irradiating a sample of crude oil in a faxed geometry with a known close of neutrons, meons for measuring the activity of Y rys arising from the ncll trons interacting ith either oxygen or chlorine present in the sample, and meals whereby the specific activity of tic Y rays from the oxygen or chlorine in the sample can be compared with that arising from a known concentration of oxygen or chlorine in crude oil. The specific activities of known concentrations of oxygen or chlorine in crude oil are derived from calibration experiments. The Y rays arising from oxygen enable the water content of the crude oil to be measured at all times, whereas the Y rays arising from chlorine can only be utilised if the water is saline, but in this case, it is the preferred way of carrying out the invention Additionally prompt Y rays arising from inelastic scattering of neutrons by ÚêC 4.43 MeV and from neutron capture by H 2.293 eV occur, and, if desired these can be used to measure H C O ratios. Also, other elemental concentrations, such as the sulphur content, can be measured using Y rays arising from neutron capture, and these provide valuable information about the composition of crude oil. In one embodiment of the invention the Y rays have an energy of 6.13 NeV and result promptly from the inelastic scattering of neutrons by the oxygen nuclei in the water In a second embodiment of the invention, although the Y rays again have an energy of 6.13 MeV, their emission is delayed and 16 results from the decay of N nuclei which are produced by high energy neutrons interacting with the O16 nuclei in the water.In a third embodiment of the invention, the y rays arise promptly from the capture of thermal neutrons by the nuclei of 35Cl present in the water in the crude oil. Y rays of many energies are produced iii this reaction, but the most intense lines are at 6.111, 6.620, 7.414 and 7.790 MeV. The invent ffion will now be described, by uay of car. ple, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in wi1.ch figure 1 is a bloc circuit diagram of an apparatus for use in carrying out the invention, and Figures 2 to 8 illustrate various alternative configurations of neutron sources and Y ray detectors for use in the apparatus of Figure 1, Ref erring to Figure 1, an apparatus for determining the water concentration of crude oil comprises a 241Am Be neutron source 1, supported in a pipe 2, through which crude oil is flowing, by an open structure 3 which also supports a Nal Tl , scintillation Y ray detector. The structure 3 is mounted on a plate 3a which is part of an elbow in the pipe 2. Also situated in the pipe 2 is a flowmeter 5, The output signal from the Y ray detector 4 is applied to an amplifier 6 and thence to a pulse height analyser 7.The pulse height analyser 7 is arranged to produce four output signals corresponding toY ray counts arising from oxygen atoms, chlorine atoms, carbon and hydrogen atoms, respectively, in the irradiated sample of oil, These output signals are fed to a data processor 8, to which also is applied a signal from the flowmeter 5 present ative of the volume of crude oil which has been irradiated by neutrons from the source 1 The data processor 8 is arranged either to produce a print out of the specific Y activity corresponding to the concentrations of one or more of the elements oxygen, chlorine, carbon and hydrogen in the sample which can be compared by an operator with previously prepared calibration charts to arrive at a measure of the concentration of water in the crude oil, and or C H O ratio if required, or the comparison can be done electronically within the data processor 8 and a direct indication of the required concentrations given. In an alternative static system, the volume of t3oe sample of oil call be obtained either by weig ing the sample, or by knowing the volume of its container. In each case an appropriate signal is fed to the data processor 8. Three of the ways in which the apparatu described can be used are as follows Method 1 The specific activity of Y rays of energy 6.13 NeV is measured to determine the amount of oxygen present in the sample of oil. The Y rays are de excitation gamma rays and result 16 from inelastic neutron scattering from 0. The relevant reaction is 16O n, n gamma 16O. This method has the advantage that the Y rays are emitted within about 10 10 secs of the excitation of the relevant nuclei. Hence, they provide an instantaneous measure of the oxygen content of the oil. Prompt gamma rays from inelastic scattering by ÚêC 4.43 MeV and from neutron capture by ÚH 2,223 MeV are also present in the Y ray spectrum. These can be used to measure H C 0 ratios, if desired. Method 2 The specific activity of 6.13 MeV Y rays with a half life of 7.1 secs is measured1 again to determine the amount of oxygen present in the sample. The Y rays, although having the same energy as those used for method 1, result from the activation of 16O to produce 16N which subsequently decays back to 160. The relevant reaction is 160 n,p 16NEMI4.1 This method has the advtntage,çllell used to measure the oxygen present in oil flowing through a pipeline, that the relatively large separation between t ie neutron source I and the detector 4 facilitates the observation of the 16N decay and significantly reduces the background of neutrcn interactions in the detector 4.This improves the signal background ratio compared to that of method 1, and consequently gives a lower limit of detection. To provide neutrons of sufficiently high energy, generally a neutron tube generating neutrons having an energy of 14 MeVis required. The arrangement used for this technique can also be used to determine the concentrations of sodium, sulphur and chlorine by measuring the decay of activity produced by similar n, p and n, alpha reactions on 23Na, 34S and 37Cl. Method 3 This method is of use when the water present in the oil is known to be saline. It makes use of prompt Y rays which arise from the capture of thermal neutrons by 35C1. The relevant reaction is 35CL n, 36C1. The cross section for thermal neutron capture by 35C1 is two orders of magnitude greater than the cross sections for the reactions employed in methods 1 and 2, so that a greaterY ray intensity is produced. Moreovcr, the thermal neutron flux falls off less rapidly with distance from the neutron source 1 than does the fast neutron flux so that a larger volume of oil can be sampled in a given time than can be done by the other two methods. Also, because of the larger signal background ratio when this method is used, the demand on the performance of the associated electronic equipment is less severe than in the previous two methods, particularly so far as the gain stability of the amplifier 6 is concerned. Ho ever, an additional Illeasurenlent has to be made to establish the salinity o the riatcr. The method does rely on the salinity of the pater remaining reasonably constant, but generally this is true ior a givcn reservoir. In practice, occasional measurements of the salinity of the water can be made to establish any trend in saline concentration. The Y rays follow neutron capture within about 10 14 secs, so like method 1 this method is not sensitive to changes in the rate of flow of the oil. Methods 1 and 2 of measuring the water content of crude oil require a high energy source of neutrons. Possible choices 241 include isotopic sources such as the Am Be source described with reference to Figure 1, and accelerator sources, for example based on the 3H d,n 4He reaction. Method 3 of measuring the water content of crude oil can also use a spontaneous fission neutron source such as that which makes use of 252Cf The signal background ratio differs between various types of detector, and the choice will depend on the application.Generally, inorganic scintillation detectors such as Nal Tl are satisfactory, but semiconductor detectors such as intrinsic Ge detectors, or organic scintillation detectors such as those known by the code number NE 2S3, can be used, Figures 2 to 8 illustrate various other source detector geometries which can be used. The main constraint is that the separation of the source 1 from the detector 4 should be such as to optimise the signal background ratio at the detector 4 For example, although the arrangement shown in Figure 1 can be used for all three methods of measuring the water content of oil, it is particularly suitable for methods 1 and 3. Figure 2 shows another source detector arrangement which is suitable for use in carrying out methods 1 or 3 of measuring the water content of crude oil, In this arrangement the the ncutro31 source 1 is again mounted in the pipe 2 by a open strxictllre 3 so that it is sulrounded by the oil the water content of which is to be measured but in this arrangement the detector 4 is mounted outside the pipe in radial alignment with the neutrons source 1. Figure 3 shows another source detector arrangement for use in carrying out methods I and 3 of measuring the water content of crude oil. In this arrangement both the neutron source 1 and the detector 4 are attached to the outside of the pipe 2. The neutron source I can, in this case, be an accelerator type source if required, It is necessary, however, to provide it with a shield 31 to absorb neutrons in directions other than directly through the oil in the pipe 2 to the detector 4. Figure 4 illustrates another source detector arrangement for use in carrying out methods i and 3 of measuring the water content of crude oil. The source 1 is positioned on the axis of the pipe 2, either by means of a structure 41 mounted on a plate 41a which forms part of an elbow in the pipe 2, such as previously illustrated, or by being placed in a tube 42 hitch is inserted radially through the wall of the pipe 2, In either case, four detectors 4 are disposed regularly around the pipe 2 in radial alignment with the neutron source 1. Figure 5 illustrates a source detector arrangement which can be used for any of methods 1, 2 and 3. The neutron source 1 and the detector 4 are inserted into tubes 51 and 52, respectively, which pass through the wall of the pipe 2, The neutron source 1 and the detector 4 are preffered to be in alignment longitudinally of the pipe 2, preferably on its axis.The separation of the detector 4 from the neutron source I is chosen to fulfil the signal background criterion previous referred to for method 2 it will be considerably greater than for methods 1 or 3, Figure 6 illustrates a second source detector arvalugamrsrvt ich can be used for nethods 1, 2 and 3 of measuring the pater content of crude oil. It is analogous to the arrangement in Figure 5 but both the neutron source 1 and the detector 4 are attached to the wall of the pipe 2.As in the arranwement of Figure 3, it is necessary to provide the source 1 lçilh a shield 60 to absorb unwanted neutrons. Figure 7 shows an arrangement which is basically similar to that of Figure 1, except that the region of the pipeline 2 in which the measuring device is incorporated is expanded to form a mixing chanber 61, and that two high pressure punps 62 are arranged to draw crude oil from that which is passing along the pipeline 1 and inject it into the mixing chamber 61 through nozzles 63 so as to ensure that the crude oil mixture passing through the pipeline 1 is well mixed before it is analysed for its water content. Also, the neutron source and Y ray detector assembly 4 are no longer immersed in the crude oil but are contained in a separate module 64 which is inserted in a housing 65 which projects from the end wall 66 of the mixing chamber 61.The neutron source 1 and the Y ray detector assembly 4 are arranged in a hack scatter geometry. A baffle 67 constrains the crude oil to flow over the surface of the housing 65 before it can leave the mixing chamber 61. The mixing chamber 61 is surrounded by a biological radiation shield 68. On the outlet side of the mixing chamber 61 there is provided a sampling facility 69 by means of which quantities of the crude oil flowing through the pipeline 1 can be drawn off for calibration and other test purposes. Figure 8 is a representation of another apparatus in which steps are taken to ensure that the crude oil flowing in the pipeline 1 are well and truly mixed before the water content is measured. Referring to Figure 8, the apparatus has inlet and outlet pipes 71 and 72 which are of the same diameter as the main pipeline 2, and which can be connected to the pipeline 2 by means of flanges 73 and 74, respectively. The inlet pipe 71 feeds into four regularly spaced subsidiary pipcs 75, the total area of which is approxilllately the same as tiat of the inlet and outlet pipes 71 and 72.The subsidiary pipes 75 recombine into the outlet pipe 72. Each of the subsidiary pipes 75 contains a helical mixing device 76 to ensure thorough mixing of the crude oil flowing in the pipeline 2. The downstream cnds of the subsidiary pipes 75 and the region where they reconltine into a single pipe are surrounded by a lead fast neutron reflector 77. In the space between the subsidiary pipes 75 there is situated a measuring module 78 consisting of an appropriate neutron source 79, a shadow shield 80, a sodium iodide crystal 81 and a photomultiplier tube 82 the output of which is connected to a data processing arrangement similar to that used for the Figure 1 embodiment and which is not illustrated further. The region between the inlet and outlet pipes 71 and 72 is surrounded by a moderator and biological radation shield 83.
