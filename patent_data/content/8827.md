íNSU Ts PIERCING EL C RiC GNNE CrOR BONDED TO ELECTRIC CONDUCTOR DESCRIPTION Technical Field This invention relates to an electrical wiring device and more specifically to a wiring device having insulation piercing interconnecting element bonded to conductor. Background There is a need in the industry for connector assemblies to maintain electrical continuity under extreme service conditions of vibration and atmospheric influences such as corrosion without loss of integrity. This requirement, of course, is in addition to other requirements such as ease of fabrication, convenient termination, and adaptability to a variety of termination mechanisms. Insulation piercing termination is well known in the prior art. United States 3,820,058, issued June 2f, 1974 to L. C. Friend, discloses a pierce type connector for a ribbon cable having a body and a pair of contact tines extending from the body. The tines diverge laterally from each other, have insulation pierce tips at their free ends, and include conductor engaging corners diverging outwardly from the body.During termination the corners engage the conductor thereby creating a mechanical contact between connector and conductor, Such an arrangement might, however, be susceptible to increasing contact resistance during extreme service conditions. United States 3,878,603, issued April 22, 1975 to L. A. Jensen, et al. discloses a method for solderless splicing of multi element cable whereby individual insulated conductors are placed into slots of a cable retaining member and engaged by forked legged connectors capable of cutting through the sides of the insulation. This type of connection, however, might also suffer from the disadvantage described above. Other types of connector to conductor contacts are also known. United States 3,615,283, issued October 26, 1971 to D. D. Long, discloses conductors with loose fitting insulating jacket which are formed into terminal loops through a punching operation. The punching process, performed by a punch and a die, cuts away a portion of the insulation and is followed by the loop formation which involves the pulling of the conductor relative to its own insulation. The resulting bare terminal loops, and the contacts formed with them, however, are subject to the effects of the environment and the disclosed process is limited to individual wires of a cable having loose fitting insulating jackets. A similar process is disclosed in United States 3,636, 9l, issuedJanuary 25, 1972 to A. D. Webster. United States 782,391, issued February 14, 1905, to A. P. hansom, discloses cable conductors whose insulating layer is perforated or cut away at certain points to permit connection to conductors.The connection is said to be by contact or bv means of a drop of solder through the gaps of the insulating layer. United States 3,772,775, issued November 20, 1973 to H. R. Bonnke, et al., discloses a met nod for connecting terminals on a printed circuit board to a flat cable by abrading a pair of windows in the cable insulation and pressing the board betweenlthe windows into a spring clip thereby forcing the exposed conductor in the standing parts of the bight so formed into contact with the terminals of the board.Contacts so formed, however, might become loosened by vibration during use. Laser beam welding 13W has been applied to spot welding very small wires, as described in Lasers in Metalworking , American Machinist SpecialReport No. 679, July 1, 1975, and Welding , AmericanMachinist Special Report No. 698, September, l 77.

Description of the Invention, The electrical connection of this invention is formed between an electrical conductor encapsulated in an insulation and a forked terminal having tines on one the forked end and an electrical contact on the other end. The conductor is formed into a bight over the base of a slot defined by the tines. The conductor is exposed at the apex of the bight and there is a permanent bond between the terminal at or near its forked end and the conductor at or near its apex. The bond is a metallurgical bond such as a weld made by laser welding. Mechanical crimping of the tines prior to welding is preferred. Connector 1 of this invention is shown inFIG 1 in assembled form terminating flat cable 2 which is comprised of a plurality of conductors 3.These are encapsulated in insulation 4 which ordinarily has the ridge and furrow external configuration shown and can be e truded or laminated into a unitary structure with the insulation 4 bonded to or in tight relationship with conductors 3. The insulation 4 can be made from any of a variety of elastomeric or polymeric materials. For most electronic service such as wiring assemblies for computers polyvinyl chloride is preferred but Teflon fluorocarbon resin registered trademark ofE. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company can also be utilized. Preferred conductors 3 are stranded and tinned, commercially pure copper wire, approximately 26 32 gage A.W.G. . However, any conductive material of any desired and functional gage can be used and the article of manufacture of the invention is adaptable to solid conductors as well. A most preferred conductor is 28 A.W.G. 7 strands A.W.G. 36 manufactured by Ernst U. Enghring Co., style No. 2651, FR1, 105 C having a.conductor spacing on .050 centers. Each conductor 3 is in electrical contact with an insulation piercing interconnecting element 5 which is an elongated blade like metal member and which transfixes insulation 4 on either side of a conductor 3. The width of the blade in the plane of flat cable 2 is approximately the same as or slightly larger than the spacing between conductors 3. SeeFIG. 18. A single such element, known as the single beam type, is shown in FIG. 2. It has one leg 8 available for contact with a plug in male unit not shown . The blade like share has shoulders 34 which seat in tne bottom of T slots, not shown, in foundation in 13 of connector 1. To provide an interconnecting element 5 for each conductor 3, the elements 5 are in staggered line array, thus accommodating the width of element 5 as can be seen in FIG. 1. Elements 5 are preferably fabricated from cupro nickel, a copper nickel tin alloy such as 89 9 2, by weight with, typically, 30 micro inch 0.75 micrometer gold in contact area 138. Any other common connector material or plating can be employed. Referring to FIG. 3, each conductor 3 passes out of insulation 4 in close proximity to the side of element 5 and forms a tight bight 6 passing through and bottomed in slot 7 in element 5 and is external to the insulation except that a small piece of insulation may be present under the bight. If present it will cushion the conductor 4 against the base of slot 7 . The conductor 3 then returns in close proximity to the other side of element 5 into insulation 4. Although electrical contact is formed between interconnecting element 5 and conductor 3 in the above configuration see also FIG. 4 , for the purpose of insuring good and continued electrical contact during extended service with super i or resistance to vibration and corrosion, each bight is permanently bonded to its associated interconnecting element 5. Bonding techniques include crimping, soldering, induction or resistance welding, thermocompression bonding, ultrasonic welding, electron beam and laser welding. Preferably, laser welding, preceded by squeezing of the tines as will be discussed in greater detail below, is the bonding method utilized. It should he noted that the configuration of bights 6 and elements 5, extending normal to and external of the plane of flat cable 2, is particularly amenable to a variety of bonding techniques because the junction is accessible during the manufacturing process from both sides as well as from above. Element 5 is further characterized by being forked, having two insulation piercing tines or tips 9 and 10 disposed on either side of slot 7. The preferred tips are arrctrhead ike in form with the inner surfaces of the arrowheads forming a throat 11 which is proportioned to be slightly smaller than the original diameter of a conductor 3 and smaller than the greatest extent of the base of slot I. In the regions where elements 5 transfix insulation 4, the insulation is sanewhat bunched or compressed as suggested at 32 and 33. Indeed this compression is such that if the termination is carried out in close proximity to an end of flat cable 2, the grip between insulation 4 and conductors 3 is broken and insulation 4 is thereby displaced relative to conductors 3 such that conductor ends 14 are retracted from the end of insulation 15. Ends of conr7uctors 14 do not extend outside the end of insulation 15 protecting the conductors 3 from unwanted electrical contacts. However, if termination is done at a distance from the ends of flat cable 2, often called daisy chaining substantially no such end displacement occurs see FIG.Ilj , relative motion hetween conductor and insulation occuring only in the vicinity of the bight formation. Insulation piercing interconnecting elements 5 are mounted in foundation 13 of connector 1 seeFIG. 1 . A preferred mode of accomplishing this is by mechanical insertion. Tabs 23 help lock elements 5 in place against the wall. Ultrasonic insertion and insert molding are alternative but less pr fer red assembly modes. Elements i are disposed within foundation 13 so that tips 9 and 10 extend above upper surface 16 of foundation i3 and legs 8 extend into cavities 17.As shewn by FIG. 3, cavities 17 are open to the outside through apertures 18, a series of suitably r..ligr.ed holes with external inward directing tapered surfaces 19, to facilitate plu ing in male connecting devices no shown . Thus each leg R functions as a female contact. wire used wi 2 single beam leg 8, cavitv 1 is preferably provided with a wall 38 shaped to support the male pin to be inserted. Foundation Ii ar be molded from any suitable reinforced plastics such as glass filled colyester or polycarbonate. Referrinc again to FIG. 1, the connector 1 has a cover or cap 20 which is attached bv suitable means to foundation 13 Can 20 molded from any suitable plastic, has a series nff holes 21 each aligned to receive the ends of an interconnecting element 5 in an interference fit with the breadth of the elen ent. Preferably the insertion of the insulation piercing ends of elements 5, carrying the tight bights of conductors 3, into holes 21 of cap 20 is carried out ultrasonically as will be discussed further below. This technique bonds cap 20 both to elements 5 encased in foundation 13 and to foundation 13 on the ends. FIG. 15 shows cap 20 in the form used for termination near the end of flat cable 2, having internal edges 36 and external rounded edge 40. Cap 20 can also function to cut and detach the ends of insulation 4 Witl knife edge 13 when the insulation extends beyond tile ends of conductors 3 and beyond the outside edge or foundation 13. Cap 20 and knife edge 134 electritally insulate the cut wire ends from inadvertent contact with external metallic parts during service. The connectors shown in FTGS. 1, 5 and 6 are shown with cap 20. FIG. 16 shows cap 20 in the form used for daisy chaining, l.e., where cable 2 contiues beyond cap 20 in both directions. Cap 20 has internal edges 36 and 27 It may also be used for end termination. This wiring device is a structure in which each element 5 and its contacting bight 5, preferably bonded to each other, is permanently assembled and is substantially encapsulated within cap 20.Furthermore, strain relief of the bonded junctions is achieved. Thus, when a strain is placed upon cable and transmitted to connector 1 at its end, the strain is relieved where conductors 3 are bent over intern21 edges 36. For a daisy chain termination, strain in both directions is accommodated by edges 36 and 37 see FIG. 16 . is is pLeLX,.rea e tip receiving holes 21 in cap 20 which are open ended, as shown inFIGS. 15 and 16. This type of construction permits insertion of test probes to chuck electrical continuity during the service life of the electrical wiring device. however, internal boles or internal cavities closed to the outside can also be employed as shown in FIG. 17 where web 41 is molded into the structure. The single beam construction of elements 5 in FIGS. 1 through 3 is a standard configuration.The interconnecting element of this invention, ho ever, can be used with any type cf male or female interconnections as has been stated above. FIG. 5 depicts interconnecting elements 51 formed with two legs 8 and 8 a construction known in the art as a dual beam . Elements 5 are similar to elements 5 of FIG. 1 except in the formation of the female contact by legs 8 and 8 . SimilArly, foundation 1Q is similar to foundation 13 except in the shape of cavity 17 which does not reauire the see shaped wall 38 of cavity 17. Cavity 17 has relieved shaped wall 38 . FIG. 6 similarly shows insulation piercing interconnecting elements 5 , similar to elements 5 ofFIG. 1 and 5 of FIG. 5 except in regard to the configuration forming the female contacts. Here contact receptacles 22 are shown. These are of the type known as MINI PV dual metal receptacles a trademark of E I. du Pont de Nemours and Company .Wall 38 is modified to form a cavity 17 suitable for the enlarged contact. The dual metal receptacle is a disconnect contact for 0.025 inch square or round pins on minimum 0.100 inch centers and often provides higher reliability than the single or dual beam designs. A receptacle for an edgecard is shown inFIG. 19. The beams 56 grip the edge of the edge card and contact strips on the surface of the edgecard.The beams 56 are shown so that they will connect opposite sides of a printed circuit board to the same connector 3. However, the beams 56 may be staggered and each connect a different circuit on opposite sides of a printed circuit board. Of course the number of such beams 56 is a matter of choice. An insulation piercing interconnecting element 5 in FIG. 20 depicts a male pin 54 at one end for engagement with a suitable female receptacle an another electrical device. The sequence of terminating cable according to this invention is shown for the configuration ofFIG. 5 which features the dual beam type female contact interconnecting element. Time lapse FIGS. 7 12 show this terminating sequence. FIG. 3 shows terminated cable with a single beam interconnecting element. An insulation piercing interconnecting element 5 mounted in terminal base 13 is shown in cross section in FIG. 7. Foundation i31 is held In a suitably shaped base tool 24. Flat cable 2 is disposed such that the array of elements 5 , a staggered line described above but not shown in IG. 7 for reasons of cla ity, is normal to the plane of cable 2. Insertion tool 25, in association with guiding means not shown holds cable 2 in this normal relationship and aligned so that each conductor 3 is approximately positioned above an associated slot 7 of an element 5 . FIG. 8 depicts the beginning of relative motion between oase tool 24 and insertion tool 25 in the direction of tr,e arrows causes tips 9 and 10 of elements 5 to penetrate insulation 4 on either side of conductors 3, the tips 9 and 10 passing completely through insulation 4 and entering slot 6 of tool 95 as conductor 3 is funneled into throat 11 best seen in FIG. 4 . . Continued motion seats conductor 3 in the base of slo 7 see FIG. 95 . A portion of insulation 4 shown as 4 in FIGS. 4 and 14 may be caught between slot 7 and conductors 3 and acts as a stress distributing membe during further forming. Insertion tool 25, shown in FIG. 13, has one slot 26 for eacb of the staggered ro s of elements 5 and, aligned with the throats 11 of elements 5 which are centered between tips t and 10, there are semicylindrical slots 28 and 29 sized to accommodate conductors 3. It s preferred hat face 30 of tool he be connected with islots 26 by double chambers 21. These facilitate ntry F conductor 3 into slots 28 and 29 and also provide for the necessary stressing of insulation 4 which rerorring now to FIG. il, is deformed to its extreme and breaks moving over the conductors 3 tc e rest position, tools of this type are employed in a variety of presses, details of press operation and the means by which the tools are attached or guided are well known. FIG. 10 illustrates the effect of further relative motion between base tool 24 and insertion tool 25. vip 10 is shown completely moved into slot 26 3nD holes 28 and 29 are beginning to accommodate conductor 3. The beginning of the formation of a tight bight over slot 7 is also shown. Insulation t is thinned out above the top of the bight and is compressed below it. FIG. 11, shows the complete formation of a tight bight through slot 7 over element 5 9nth the the wire exposed through the insulation. Tool 25 is removed at this stage and hence not shown in this figure. When a multistrand conductor is employed, it tends to assume the cross sectional configuration shown in FIG. 4. To maintain electrical continuity under extreme service conditions, it is preferred to bond conductors 3 to interconnecting elements 5 in order to avoid or minimize the long range effects of corrosion and vibration. Such bonding can be achieved by a variety of metallurgical bonding techniques. In order to ensure permanent bonding, it is important that the interconnecting element 5 is positioned in the foundation portion 13 of the dielectric housing so that when the conductor is located at the base of slot 7 it is bent back on itself forming a bight over the base of the tine. A loop is thereby formed and the conductor is exposed, the loop having a height of at least the thickness of the conductor above the top of the insulation.Higher loops are acceptable up to a height limited S cr the practicable necessity of covering the inserted connector in a dielectric housing cover. Such a position is shown in FIG. 3. The inserted conductor 3 is thereby bent back on itself forming a bight 6 over the base 7 of said tines. The conductor is exposed from its insulation 4 at the apex of the bight 6. This exposed conductor can then be bonded to the tine directly by a laser weld or can beCrimped oy the tines and then laser welded to form a pc ar r electrical bond as shown at 500 in FIG.18. In FIG 2, each tight bight formed in conductor 3 over an interconnecting element 5 has been subjected to the action of a crimping tool 34.This crimping tool is illustrated in FIG. 14 and comprises a series of appropriately spaced holes of controlled depth and having a blind conical base C. The coni cal base preferably has a 90 angle. The ,o es are sized as shown in FIG. 14 so that opposing motion between tool 34 and base tool 24 causes the crimping of tips 9 and 10 together as shown by the phantom lines in FIG. 14. Thus, strands 12 are mechanically held in place in slot 7 above insulation portion 4 . The configuration shown by the phantom lines is schem2twc, in actual practice, the closure beetween the arrowheads is less uniform. Metallurgical bonding produces permanent interface between conductors 3 and elements 5 leading to improved electrical continuity in service. Laser welding is the preferred technique utilized in obtaining the electrical connection and wiring device of this invent on. By metallurgical bonding is meant an electrical contact formed between interconnecting element and conductor in such a manner that some tretal metal fusion occurs. Su ch bonding is brought not by the apol.caçion of some form of energy at or near tne area where a rigid bond is to he formed. Metallurgical bonding techniques include a variety of welding methods such as laser beam welding. LBW has several advantages over other welding methods, e.g., it does not require electrode contact or flux. 13W has high heat in..ensq y anc the beam impacts on a small area these factors contribute to localized heating and rapid cooling resulting in a small heat affected zone. The highly collimated monochromatic beam of light generated in a laser is focused on a surface and is partially reflected, and partially absorbed. Optimum welding performance depends on absorptivity, thermal conductivity, aensity, heat capecity,.melting point, and surface condition of the metals to be joined as well as the chaeacteristlcs of the laser such as power density, wave length and pulse length. It has been found that a pulsed reodymi LM laser using Nd Glass with an output of 10 15 joules can successfully weld cupro nickel, gold flashed materials, and phosphor bronze. All of these materials afford acceptable quality wel s, CuNi being the best. For example, welding cupro nickel to copper, joint resistances of less than 1 milliohm are obtained versus 10 15 milliohms range considered to be the maximum allowable. Also, a direct tension strength of 1.5 4 pounds per termination is achieved. A technique favored for carrying out laser welding involves positioning the welder so that its beam is within 900 of perpendicular to the long axis of the interconnecting element 5 and is aligned with the center of slot 7 after crimping.Approximately 5 millisecond pulse length of the laser, delivering 10 15 joules, can accomplish the bonding of an element 5 to the corresponding conductor 3. Such an operation of the laser is said to be operating in the conventional mode. Either or both of tips 9 and 10 of interconnecting elements 5 are partially melted and flow over and between heated strands 12 of conductor 3 forming a metallurgical bond. Both tinned and untinned wire can be welded tc CuNi with a plused CO2 laser. Such welds can achieve junction resistances of from 0.05 0. 0 mi liohm and shear strengths of from 2.7 4.8 pounds to treak. Most preferably, an Nd YAG yttrium aluminum garnet plused laser is utilized for high speed multiple welds. The most preferred laser weld is accomplished by contouring the laser beam and aiming it so that a sianificant portion of the energy falls upon the conductor. This appears to preheat the conductor so that good fusion is obtained. The major t5 n of the earn s directed on the tines 9 and They are melted and the melt contacts the exposed conductor and uses to it.The laser is employed using a circular be m shape with an overallDiameter of 0.0q0 to 0.100 ,tch and a conceritric high energy core ranging between 0.055 and 0.075 inch in dìneter. The core is entered on a point on the tines above conductor strands 12 approximately 0.020 to 0.025 inch and in line with slot 7 placing the strands on the edge of the beam core or within it.This configuration provides good welds without destruction of the conductor using a Nd YAG laser operated in a pulsed mode with pulse energy levels of l0 15 joules Other beam shapes besides circular are known and adaptable to the welding process such as rectangular, square, figure 8 , or modifications thereof such as concentric rings. Each may anply particular instances. Similarly known a the means to vary the beam dimensions. These include bearn divergence, power and especially Optics. FIG. 18 shows 2 dielectric housing foundation 13 containing interconnect ve element 5 passing in front of a laser beam after the pierced flat cable 2 has been bent over and the cond ctor 3 exposed in the bight 6 at the base of the tines. The conductor is shorn with the tines squeezed shown before the laser benm hits the tines and the bight 6 causing a metall gica1 bond 50 to form. This bond makes the connection permanent. After the bonding is completed, cap 20 is installed and sealed to foundation 13. It is preferred to position cap 20 in a fixture under an ultrasonic horn so that elements 5 are aligned to enter holes 21 in cap 20 in interference fit for permanent attachment. Cap 20 can also be ultrasonically bonded to foundation 13 thereby yielding a connector assembly as shown in FIGS. 1, 5 or 6.
