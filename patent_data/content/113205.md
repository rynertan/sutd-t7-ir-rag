# Method of, and apparatus for, filtering a slurry.

## Abstract
Filter cake formed from a slurry is dried in a filter press comprising a plurality of filtration units 1 each having a chamber 6 bounded by a pair of opposed flexible walls each comprising a filter medium 5 and an outwardly located flexible membrane 8 . The filter cake is formed and or compressed in the chambers 6 by hydraulic fluid pressure acting on the flexible membranes 8 . By means of pressure oscillations set up in the hydraulic fluid the filter cake in the chambers 6 is deformed by bowing to either side of an initial central plane alternately whereby drying is improved.
