# Wear resistant and shock resistant tools and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
Wear resistant and shock resistant tools 14 are con structed by preforming carbide containing working parts 10 of high wear resistance and hardness and attaching them to a softer base metal 12 of the tool by means of a highly shock resistant steel to steel fusion weld. The work ing part 10 is preformed by powdered metallurgy techni ques utilizing steel powders having carbide forming con stituents therein which form carbides along the grain boun daries of the steel uniformly throughout the working part as a result of sintering of the compressed powders. Thereafter the fusion welding process renders the carbide structure of the working part nonuniform for optimum shock resistance, without reducing the effective wear resistance thereof, while also forming a highly shock resistant joint between the working part 10 and the base metal 12 of the tool.
