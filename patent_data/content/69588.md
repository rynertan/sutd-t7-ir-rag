# Semiconductor integrated memory circuit.

## Abstract
A semiconductor integrated memory circuit in which bit line precharge circuits, sense amplifier circuits and input output line precharge circuits are respectively divided into two groups by select circuits which are controlled by a select control signal. Only the selected precharge circuits and the sense amplifier circuits are enabled before a read out operation. The peak current for precharging bit lines is reduced to one half as compared to conventional circuits due to the decrease of stray capacitance to be precharged.
