## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE IN.ENTION Aromatic carbonate polymers are well known, ccm mercially available materials having a wide variety of applications in the plastics art. Such carbonate polymers may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol, such as 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, in the presence of an acid binding agent. Generally speaking, aromatic polycarbonate resins offer a high resistance to the attack of mineral acids, may be easily molded, are physiologically harmless as well as strain resistant. It is also well known that polycarbonate resins have high impact strength below a critical thickness of between about 1 8 and 1 4 inch.Above this average thickness the impact strength of polycarbonate resins is low.Moreover, the impact strength of polycarbonate resins decreases rapidly as the temperature decreases below about 5 C. and also after aging the polymers at elevated temperatures above about 1000C. These characteristics consequently limit the fields of application for unmodified aromatic polycarbonate resins. Accordingly, in an effort to improve the impact resistant behavior of polycarbonate resins, it has been proposed to add modifiers to the polycarbonate. InGoldblum, U.S. 3,431,224,EMI1.1 EMI1.2 for example, it is proposed to add modifiers in certain proportions, the modifiers comprising at least one member of the class consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, a copolymer of ethylene and an ethyl acrylate, a copolymer of ethylene and propylene, a cellulose ester, a polyamide, a polyvinyl acetal, an alkyl cellulose ester, and a polyurethane elastomer. Although the results with such modifiers are generally excellent in thin sections, e.g., in parts of 1 8 inch thickness, there is a tendency for failure to occur with these modifiers in thicker molded parts of 1 4 inch or more, and such failure is of the ur.aesir able brittle type. There still remains a recurring need to discover polycarbonate molding resins which are easier to process and maintain good impact strength without brittleness or may even show better impact particularly in thickness above the critical thickness of polycarbonate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that certain resin blends comprising a an aromatic polycarbonate, b an amorphous polyester and or a polyalkylene terephthalate and c a block copolymer resin including polycarbonate and diorganopolysiloxane units provide desirable physical properties which are not obtainable with previously known resin blends. The resultant resin blends have a much reduced melt viscosity, which provides easier processing characteristics. In addition, articles molded from the novel resin blends have better impact properties. They have a tendency to show good impact strength and retain ductility upon break. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention it has been found that the foregoing desirable properties are obtained with resin mixtures comprising an intimate blend of a an aromatic polycarbonate resin b an amorphous copolyester copolymer resin, and or a polyalkylene terephthalate and c a modifier therefore comprising a blocks cc polymer comprising i blacks derived from an aromatic polycarbonate, and ii blocks derived from a diorganopolysiloxane, b and c in such quantities that the composition has reduced melt viscosity and similar or better impact properties in comparison to polycarbonate. The relative amounts of the components will vary broadly, but in general best results are obtained when the compositions comprise from about 25 to 98 parts, preferably about 50 to 95, by weight of the aromatic polycarbonate resin component a , from about 1 to 50 parts by weight of the copolyester resin component b , preferably about 2 to 25, and from about 0.5 to 25 parts by weight of the modifier component c , preferably about 1 to about 15, based on the weight of the overall resin composition. The weight percent of component c is based upon the diorganosiloxane containing block of component c . The wholly polycarbonate block of component c is treated as a portion of the polycarbonate in component a . The blending of the components may be accomplished in any manner so long as a thorough inter distribution of the components is achieved.Generally, the amorphous copolyester resin component b is blended with the aromatic polycarbonate resin a , and thereafter the polycarbonate polysiloxane block copolymer modifier is added, but this is not critical. The blending of these materials may be accomplished by a variety of methods normally employed for incorporation of plasticizers or fillers into thermoplastic polymers, including but not limited to mixing rolls, dough mixers, Banbury mixers, extruders, and other mixing equipment. The resulting blends may be handled in any conventonal manner employed for the fabrication or manipulation of thermoplastic resins.The materials may be formed or molded using compression, injection, calendaring, extrusion and blow molding techniques, alone or in any combination. Also multiprocessing methods, such as extrusion blow molding or co extrsion cc injection can be used, e.g., for multilayer containers. It should be understood that the resin mixtures prepared in accordance with the invention may also contain, in addition to the above mentioned polymers, other additives to lubricate, reinforce, prevent oxidation, or lend color to the material. Other additives, such as mold release agents and stabilizers are well known in the art, and may be incorporated without departing from the scope of the invention. The fact that the combination of components specified above to form a polycarbonate resin system provides a resin blend having the aforementioned properties relating to impact as well as reduced melt viscosity, is unexpected and not fully understood. The aromatic polycarbonate resins suitable for use herein as component a may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, a haloformate or a carbonate ester. Typically, such carbonate polymers are represented as comprising recurring structural units of the formula EMI4.1 wherein A is a divalent aromatic radical of the dihydric phenol employed in the polymer producing reaction. Preferably, the carbonate polymers used to pro vac the resinous mixtures of the invention have an intrinsic viscosity as measured in methylene chloride at 25 C. ranging rrcm about 0.30 to about 1.00 dl g. The dihydric phenols which may be employed to provide such aromatic carbonate polymers are mononuclear cr polynuclear aromatic compounds, containing as functional groups two hydroxy radicals, each of which is attached directly to a carbon atom of an aromatic nucleus. Typical dihydric phenols are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane hydroquinone resorcinol 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl methane bis 2 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxyphenyl methane bis 4 hydroxy 5 nitrophenyl methane I,l bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 3,3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2, 2 dihydroxydiphenyl 2,6 dihydroxynaphthalene bis 4 hydroxydiphenyl sulfone bis 3,5 diethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl sulfone 2, 2 bis 3,5 dimethyl 4 hydroxyphenyl propane, 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone 5 chloro 2,4 dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone bis 4 hydroxyphenyl diphenyl sulfone 4 4 dihydroxydiphenyl ether 4,4 dihydroxy 3,3 dichlorodiphenyl ether 4,4 dihydroxy 2,5 dihydroxydiphenyl ether and the like. Other dihydric phenols which are also suitable for use in the preparation of the above polycarbonates are disclosed in U.S. 2,999,835 3,038,365 3,334,154 and 4,131,575. These aromatic ooLw arbonates can be manufactured by known processes, such as, for example and as mentioned above, by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor, such as phosgene, in accordance with methods set forth in the above cited literature andU.S. 4,018,750 and 4,123,426, or by transesteriication processes such as are disclosed in U.S. 3,153,008, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. It is possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or with a hydroxy or acid terminated polyester or w.th a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the polycarbonate mixtures of the invention. Branched polycarbonates are also useful, such as are described in U.S.4,001,184. Also there can be utilized blends of a linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate.Moreover, blends of any of the above materials may be employed in the practice of this invention to provide the aromatic polycarbonate. In any event, the preferred aromatic carbonate polymer for use as component a herein is a homopolymer derived from 2,2 bis 4hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A . The subject invention also comprises as component b an amorphous copolyester polymer resin and or a polyalkylene terephthalate. The poly alkylene terephthalate resins suitable for use as component b herein are very well known and may be prepared by methods set forth in Whinfield, U.S.2,465,319 and Pengilly, U.S. 3,047,539. The resins will generally comprise a C1 C10 polyalkylene terephthalate. Poly ethylene terephthalate is generally preferred and may be utilized as virgin or scrap polymer. If aesirec, other polyalkylene terephthal ates, such as poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , or m tnA tures of polyalkylene terephthalates may be employed. The amorphous copolyester copolymer resin for use as component b herein is a polyester copolymer which can, without limitation, comprise the reaction product of a glycol portion and a do acid portion. The glycol portion comprises 1,4 cycloheanedimethanol with or without an alkylene glycol of two to ten carbon atoms, inclusive, preferably two to four carbon atoms, more preferably two carbon atoms ethylene glycol. When an alkylene glycol is present, for example ethylene glycol, the molar ratio of the 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol to ethylene glycol in the glycol portion of the polymer is from about 4 1 to 1 4. The acid portion comprises terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or mixtures of both acids. This copolyester component may be prepared by procedures well known to those skilled in this art, such as by condensation reactions substantially as shown and described in U.S. 2,901,466.

The relative amounts of the l,4 cyclohexanedimethanol to ethylene glycol in the glycol portion may vary so long as the molar ratio of 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol to ethylene glycol is from 1 4 to 4 1, in order to provide a polyester copolymer having suitable properties and a heat distortion temperature within the recited range.
