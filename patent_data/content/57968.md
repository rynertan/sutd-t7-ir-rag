# MAKING PAINT OR THE LIKE

## Abstract
Dispersion apparatus for making paint has the powder delivered to the pot containing the solvent through a tube which dips slightly below the surface of the solvent, and the interior of the pot is maintained at sub atmospheric pressure to cause induced flow of powder directly into the solvent. This greatly reduces ambient atmospheric pollution and rapid and efficient dispersion.
