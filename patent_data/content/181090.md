# Method and apparatus for producing rapidly solidified microcrystalline metallic tapes.

## Abstract
A method of producing a rapidly solidified microcrystal line metallic tape and an apparatus for producing the same are disclosed, wherein molten metal is continuously poured through a nozzle 9 onto surfaces of cooling members 3,3 to form a rapidly solidified metallic tape 5 and then the tape 5 is coiled on a reel 20 . In this method, the metallic tape 5 is secondarily cooled and rolled before the coiling. Further, the apparatus comprises a means for cutting 4,4 out a non steady portion of the metallic tape 5 , a means 17 for measuring tape thickness, a secondary cooling means, 12,12 and a means 21,22 for controlling a tension of the metallic tape 5 .
