# MEANS FOR CONNECTING A CONTAINER TO A DISPENSER

## Abstract
Means for connecting a container to a dispenser such as an optic in a tamperproof fashion include a sleeve 5 for fitting within the neck of a bottle, an outer screw seal 4 for co operating with the sleeve to form a fluid tight seal at the lip of the bottle and a shrink fit tubular member 10 for binding the bottle and the screw seal 4. The screw seal 4 is secured to a shaft 6 of a dispenser by means of a thumb screw 6. Once the bottle is in place, it cannot be removed from the dispenser without the tamperproof seal formed by the tubular member 10 being broken.
