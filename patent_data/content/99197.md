## Description
LAUNDRY ADDITIVE PRODUCTS This invention relates to laundry additive products.In particular, it relates to laundry additive products for cleaning clothes and the like in domestic and commercial washing machines, the additive product containing a storage sensitive detergency additive material. It is widely recognized that the function of a detergency additive material can be significantly impaired in detergent and other laundry compositions by interaction between the additive material and other components of the composition or even with air. For example, detergency enzymes can be deleteriously effected by interaction with bleaches, sequestrants, acids and bases, surfactants and air perfumes and bleach activators can be deleteriously effected by interaction with bleaches cationic fabric conditioners can be deleteriously effected by interaction with anionic surfactants fluorescers can be deleteriously effected by interaction with bleaches and cat ionic surfactants and suds suppressors can also be deleteriously effected by interaction with surfactants.Moreover, the consumer acceptibility of a product can also be significantly reduced as the result of physical interactions between a laundry additive material and other components of a composition. For instance, a speckled detergent containing a water soluble dye can lose its aesthetic appeal as a result of migration of the dye into the detergent base formula, an effect which can be significantly enhanced by the presence in the detergent composition of a nonionic surfactant component. One approach adopted in the art for minimizing storage stability problems for sensitive ingredients is to agglomerate the sensitive ingredient, for example by extrusion, wet agglomeration, etc and to add the resulting agglomerate to a detergent base powder. British Patents 1,204,123, 1,441,416 and 1,395,006 are representative of this general approach. The technique suffers a number of disadvantages, however. For example, physical segregation problems caused by differences in particle size and or bulk density between the agglomerate and the base powder can contribute to reduced aesthetic appeal and reproducibility of performance. More importantly, the agglomerates are prone to interparticle abrasion which can lead to partial or even total disintegration of the agglomerates with concomitant problems of reduced storage stability and increased dust formation. The Applicants have now discovered that laundry additive materials having improved storage stability can be provided by dispersing agglomerated particles of the additive material in an organic matrix of defined thermal characteristics and which is combined in water releasable manner with a water insoluble, unitary carrier.The resulting laundry additive products have improved storage stability, convenience and reproducibility in use and reduced problems of dust formation. Accordingly, the present invention provides a laundry additive product characterized by a a solid laundry additive composition comprising discrete agglomerated particles of storage sensitive detergency additive dispersed in a water soluble or water dispersible matrix of organic materials having a melting completion temperature of less than about 850C, the laundry additive composition being in water releasable combination with b a unitary water insoluble carrier. The storage sensitive detergent additive is suitably selected from detergency enzymes, bleaches, bleach activators and bleach catalysts, photoactivators, dyes, fluorescers, suds suppressors, perfumes, fabric conditioning agents, and hydrolysable surfactants. Highly preferred are detergency enzymes, especially proteases, amylases and mixtures thereof. The laundry additive product will also usually incorporate an antagonist material responsible for the deleterious effect on storage stability of the additive alternatively, the additive material will be sensitive to storage in the presence of some environmental factor such as air, moisture, or sunlight.Preferred laundry additive materials and their specific antagonists are listed below Additive Antagonist i Detergency Enzymes Bleaches, Sequestrants, Acids, Bases or Surfactants ii Bleaches Bleach Activators or Catalysts, Acids or Bases iii Bleach Activators or Bleaches, Acids or Bases Bleach Catalysts iv Photoactivators Nonionic Surfactants v Dyes Nonionic Surfactants vi Fluorescers Bleaches or Cationic Surfactants vii Suds controllers Surfactants viii Perfumes Bleaches ix Fabric Conditioning Agents Anionic Surfactants x Hydrolysable Surfactants Acids or Bases The laundry additive composition preferbly comprises at least about 40 , more preferably at least about 50 , especially at least about 60 of organic matrix materials having a melting completion temperature of less than about 850C.These in turn each preferably have a melting completion temperature of less than about 750C, more preferably less than about 700C.

Highly preferred binding agents comprise at least about 40 , especially at least about 50 thereof of polyethyleneglycol having a molecular weight greater than about 4000. The agglomerate component of the additive product generally comprises the detergency additive material together with an agglomerating agent. In addition, the agglomerate can contain a solid diluent. The detergency additive and diluent are both preferably particulate in form with an average particle size of less than about 150 microns, more preferably less than 100 microns, especially less than 50 microns. A small particle size contributes to improved dispersability of the agglomerate.

The average particle size of the agglomerate after dispersion is preferably at least about 100 microns, more preferably from about 150 microns to about 2000 microns. The agglomerating agent can take the form of a carrier in which the detergency additive and, if present, diluent are dispersed, or the agglomerating agent can simply act to promote physical adhesion of the component particles of the agglomerate.

Turning to the laundry additive composition, this is in solid form at ambient temperatures 250C and below and preferably has a softening temperature of at least about 350C, more preferably at least about 400C, especially at least about 500 C. By softening temperature is meant the temperature at which there is transition from plastic flow to viscous flow properties at ambient temperatures, therefore, the composition takes the form of a plastic solid having a non zero yield stress. The hardness of the compositions at ambient temperatures can be determined by standard methods, for example, by the penetrometer based technique of IP49 or the technically equivalent ASTM D5 or BS4691 .Thus, laundry additive compositions preferred for use wherein have a penetration under a 100g load at 250C after 15 seconds under IP49 of less than about 10 measured in tenths of a millimetre , more preferably less than about 7. The softening temperature of the composition, on the other hand, is taken herein to be the temperature at which the IP49 15 second penetration exceeds about 30. The laundry additive composition herein comprises a matrix of organic materials of defined melting characteristics. Melting completion temperatures are determined using a Dupont 910 Differential ScanningCalorimeter with Mechanical Cooling Accessory and R90Thermal Analyser as follows. A 5 10 mg.sample of the organic material containing no free water or solvent is encapsulated in a hermetically sealed pan with an empty pan as reference. The sample is initially heated until molten and then rapidly cooled at about 20 300C min to 700C. Thermal analysis is then carried out a a heating rate of 100C min using sufficient amplification ofa T signal ie temperature difference between sample and reference vertical axis to obtain an endotherm peak signal baseline noise ratio of better than 10 1. The melting completion temperature is then the temperature corresponding to the intersection of the tangential line at the steepest part of the endotherm curve at the high temperature end of the endotherm, with the horizontal line, parallel t6 the sample temperature axis, through the highest temperature endotherm peak. The organic materials constituting the matrix have a melting completion temperature of less than about 850C. In addition, the laundry additive products of the invention preferably contain at least about 5 by weight of composition of binding agent defined as organic material having a melting completion temperature of less than 850C, preferably less than about 800C, especially less than about 700C, and a melting onset temperature of at least 350C, preferably at least 400C, especially at least 500C. The melting onset temperature can once again be determined by thermal analysis as described above and is taken to be the sample temperature at the point of intersection of the base line with a tangent to the steepest part of the endotherm nearest the low temperature end of the endotherm. In a highly preferred embodiment, the additive composition is coated on or impregnated into a flexible sheet like substrate at a weight ratio of composition substrate of at least about 3 1, preferably at least about 5 1. Preferred substrates for use herein are apertured nonwoven fabrics which can generally be defined as adhesively bonded fibrous or filamentous products, having a web or carded fibre structure where the fibre strength is suitable to allow carding or comprising fibrous mats, in which the fibres or filaments are distributed haphazardly or in random array i.e. an array of fibres in a carded web wherein partial orientation of the fibres is frequently present as well as a completely haphazard distributional orientation or substantially aligned.The fibres or filaments can be natural e.g. wool, silk, wood pulp, jute, hemp, cotton, linen, sisal, or ramie , synthetic e.g.rayon, cellulose, ester, polyvinyl derivatives, polyolefins, polyamides, or polyesters or mixtures of any of the above. Generally, non woven cloths are made by air or water laying processes in which the fibres or filaments are first cut to desired lengths from long strands, passed into a water or air stream, and then deposited onto a screen through which the fibre laden air or water is passed. The deposited fibres or filaments are then adhesively bonded together, dried, cured and otherwise treated as desired to form the non woven cloth. Preferably, the non woven cloth is made from cellulosic fibres, particularly from regenerated cellulose or rayon, which are lubricated with standard textile lubricant such as sodium oleate. Preferably the fibres are from about 4 to about 50 mm, especially from about 8mm to about 20mm, in length and are from about 1 to about 5 denier Denier is an internationally recognised unit in yarn measure, corresponding to the weight in grams of a 9,000 meter length of yarn . Preferably the fibres are at least partially orientated haphazardly, particularly substantially haphazardly, and are adhesively bonded together with hydrophobic or substantially hydrophobic binder resin, particularly with a nonionic self crosslinking acrylic polymer or polymers.In highly preferred embodiments, the cloth comprises from about 75 to about 88 , especially from about 78 to about 84 fibre and from about 12 to about 25 , especially from about 16 to about 22 hydrophobic binder resin polymer by weight and has a basis weight of from about 10 to about 70, preferably from 20 to 50 g m2.Suitable hydrophobic binder resins are ethylacrylate resins such as Primal HA24 Rhoplex HA8 and HA16 Rohm and Haas,Inc and mixtures thereof. The flexible substrate for use herein is preferably an apertured substrate having an aperture density of from about 10 to about 30, preferably from about 13 to about 26, more preferably from 16 to about 23 apertures per sq cm of sheet, wherein the apertures, on average, have a width of from about 0.5mm to about 5mm and a length of from about 0.8mm to about Smm, the substrate carrying a water releasable coating of the laundry additive composition and having areas of uncoated apertures and areas wherein the coating covers the apertures and extends between opposing surfaces of the substrate, the ratio of areas of uncoated to coated apertures being in the range from about 15 1 to about 1 3.The apertures themselves are generally symmetrical about a longitudinal axis ie they have mirror symmetry and preferably have, on average, a width of from about 0.7 to about 2.5mm and a length of from about 1.7mm to about 4mm.The area of the apertures, on the other hand, is preferably from about 0.7mm2 to about 7mm2, more preferably from about 0.8mm2 to about 3.5mm2, and the ratio of length width is from 1 1 up to preferably about 6 1, more preferably about 4 1. These parameters are highly preferred from the viewpoint of achieving the optimum ratio of areas of uncoated to coated apartures and the complete filling of coated apertures from one surface of the substrate to the other. The substrate apertures herein can be elongate in shape for example, generally elliptical or diamond shaped in which case the apertures preferably have a width of from about 0.8mm to about 1.5mm and a length of from about 2mm to about 3.5mm.In preferred embodiments, however, the apertures are generally square shaped with a side dimension of from about 1 to 2.5mm. As used herein, length refers to the dimension of the principal ie longest longitudinal axis, and width is the maximum dimension perpendicular to this axis. As far as loading ratio is concerned ie the weight ratio of composition substrate this preferably is at least about 6 1 and more preferably at least 7 1 r Moreover the ratio of the areas of uncoated to coated apertures in the final product is preferably from about 6 1 to about 1 2, more preferably from about 4 1 to about 1 1. An example of an apertured non woven substrate suitable herein is a regenerated cellulose sheet of 1.5 denier fibres bonded with Rhoplex HA 8 binder fibre binder ratio of about 77 23 . having a basis weight of about 35 g m2 and about 17 apertures cm2. The apertures are generally ellipitical in shape and are in side by side arrangement. The apertures have a width of about 0.9mm and a length of about 2.3mum measured in a relaxed condition.Another highly preferred substrate based on 1.5 denier regenerated cellulose fibres with Rhoplex HA8 binder has a fibre binder ration of about 82 18, a basis weight of about 35g m2, and about 22 apertures cm2. In this example, the apertures are generally square shaped with a width relaxed of about l.lmm. The apertures are again disposed in side by side arrangement. The size and shape of the substrate sheet for each unit of product is a matter of choice and is determined principally by factors associated with the convenience of its use. Thus the sheet should not be so small as to become trapped in the crevices of the machine or the clothes being washed or so large as to be awkward to package and dispense from the container in which it is sold. For the purposes of the present invention sheets ranging in plan area from about 130 cm2 to about 1300 cm2 are acceptable, the preferred area lying in the range of from about 520 cm2 to about 780 cm2 . In In another embodiment, the laundry additive composition takes the form of an aggregate of physically discrete solid bodies having the agglomerated particles of storage sensitive detergency additive dispersed therein, the aggregate being incorporated in a water permeable or water frangible pouch. Suitable pouch materials include apertured substrates as described above, the relative dimensions of the aggregate and substrate apertures being such as to prevent sifting of laundry additive composition through the apertures during mechanical handling.Alternatively, the pouch material can contain a water frangible seam or regions of low wet strength which rupture to allow egress of the additive composition during the wash cycle. The laundry additive products qf the invention can be supplemented by all manner of laundering and detergency components.
