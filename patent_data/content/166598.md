# Pattern recognition apparatus.

## Abstract
A pattern recognition apparatus includes an image input device 2 for inputting an object pattern 1 , an analog digital converter 3 for converting an analog image signal from the im age input device to a binary signal, a frame memory 4 for stor ing the binary signal, a pattern matching circuit 5 which com pares the signal stored in the frame memory 4 with a template pattern, corresponding to a predetermined character or image, in a template memory, a template matching circuit 9 which compares template patterns of different characters or images and a featured template forming circuit 8 which automatically forms mismatched portions of the compared template patterns as features of a featured template and registers the same in the template memory 6 .
