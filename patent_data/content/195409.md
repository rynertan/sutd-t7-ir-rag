# PLASMA TRANSFER WELDED ARC TORCH

## Abstract
A plasma arch torch having an upper body of a non conductive material supporting an electrode and a lower body of a conductive material supporting a nozzle through which an arc is formed between the electrode and a work piece. A mixture of inert gas and a fusible powder may be blown through a passageway formed in said lower body and through passages formed in said nozzle onto the work piece. A liquid coolant is circulated through a reservoir formed in the lower body, and an inert gas is discharged through an opening that circumvallates the nozzle. Both the nozzle and the torch as a whole are uniquely constructed to avoid many of the problems caused by the use of insulators and fluid seals. In addition, the novelty of construction enhances performance.
