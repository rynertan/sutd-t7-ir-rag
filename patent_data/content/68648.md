# Corrosion inhibiting material, especially for use in paint compositions.

## Abstract
A corrosion inhibiting paint comprises a resin ve hicle containing a water soluble glass which, on disso lution in water, releases corrosion inhibiting materials. The glass itself, or the combination of the glass and the paint, are so constituted that conditions of low acidity, i.e. above pH 4.0, are presented to a metal surface to which the print is applied. The glass may contain phosphorus pentoxide as the glass forming oxide together with one or more Group IIA or IIB metal oxides as the glass modifying oxide or oxides.
