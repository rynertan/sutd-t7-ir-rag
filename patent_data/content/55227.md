# Automatic headlight beam switching device for automotive vehicles.

## Abstract
This invention refers to an electronic device which by means of a photocell 1 placed at the input of an inverting comparator IC1 the output of which drives a power transistor TR2 , controls a relay RL1 which in turn changes the position of the headlights from high to low. The light coming from the headlights of any vehicle equip ped with the device according to the invention, in hitting the above mentioned photocell 1 acutates the device itself automatically changing the headlights from the position of high to that of low.

## Claims
Claims 1. Automatic headlight beam switching device for automotive vehicles comprising in combination a photocell a Wheatstone bridge an inverting comparator the input of which is con nected, through said Wheatstone bridge, to said photocell a diode a power transistor driven by the output of said comparator through said diode a relay actuated by said poser transistor and which switches the headlights from the position of high to that of low, so that the headlights of the automotive vehicle are switched automatically every time the light from the headlights of a vehicle moving in the opposite direction with respect to the sense of direction of the vehicle equipped with said device, hits said photocell.

## Description
Automatic headlight beam switching device for automotive vehicles.It is known that, so far, in order to change the headlights of an automotive vehicle from the high to low position a lever switch is used which is manually actuated and placed on the column of the steering wheel.It is obvious that this manual switching solution. is uncomfortable being as it is continuously required to pass from a position of high beam lights, every time another vehicle is encountered, to a position of low beam lights.It is therefore the object of this invention to eliminate the inconvenience of manuality existing today in switching headlight beams in an automotive vehicle, making this operation totally automatic by controlling the headlights through an electronic device.The invention will be further illustrated with reference to the single drawing enclosed herein, in which Fig. 1 shows the electrical diagram of the device according to the invention in a preferred embodiment thereof. With reference to the drawing,the common contact of the double switching relay RL1, is connected to the voltage coming from the lever switch not shown of the headlights placed in its low beam position, in the NC position of the relay RL1 the wires are connected which power the low light filament of the headlight lamps while in the position NA of relay RL1 the wires are connected which power the high beam filaments.This arrangement of the contacts of the relay RL1 makes it so that when the device is powered and the headlights are in the low position said relay is excited and contactC closes with contact NC thus powering the high beam while, if contact C closes with contact NA the low beam will be powered.Still referring to the drawing, it may be seen furthermore, that the device is formed by a photocell 1 and a transistor TR1, by a Wheatstone bridge R2, R3, R4, an operational amplifier ICI connected as an inverting comparator the exit of which drives, through diode D1, a transistor TR2 which in turn controls the doubleswitching RL1 relay.Every time it is hit by the light, the photocell 1 alters its resistance polarizing transistor TR1 which amplifies the current which it receives from said photocell 1 thus altering the Wheatstone bridge arm arm of R2 in which it is connected. The variable resistance R1 serves the purpose of adjusting the sensitivity of the device.It should be noted here that the entire group of the circuit forming the Wheatstone bridge is formed by fixed resistanceR2, by the sensitive group of the photocell 1 and Trl, by fixed resistor R3 and by resistor R5 which is a variable resistance in series with resistance R4 which controls the switching level of operational amplifier ICI the output of which, through diode Dl drives transistor TR2 which in turn actuates the relay Roll. operation of the device according to the invention is as follows Every time the light of the headlights of a vehicle moving in the opposite direction of the vehicle equipped with the device according to the invention hits the photocell 1, the latter through the Wheatstone bridge, the integrated circuit ICI and transistor TR2 automatically switches the position of the headlights from high to low, restoring, in the vehicle equipped with the device, the position of the headlights again to high as soon as the vehicle moving in the opposite direction has passed on. All this, as previously stated, takes place in a totally automatic way thus avoiding the driver the annoying, and often forgotten, operation of turning down the headlights when encountering another vehicle.Finally the device according to the invention also provides for maintaining the old manual switch operation which may be reinserted by actuating the specially provided switch Fl. The invention has been described according to a preferred embodiment which is not be intended as limitating but only for purposes of example.It is however obvious that variations and modifications may be applied by those skilled in the art to the device according to the invention without departing from the scope thereof.
