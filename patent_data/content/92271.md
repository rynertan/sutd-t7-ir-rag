# Process for polymerising conjugate diolefins, and means suitable for this purpose.

## Abstract
A new process is described for polymerising and copo lymerising conjugate diolefins, characterised by using a catal ytic system formed from at least one metal pertaining to Group IIIB of the Periodic System, at least one non halogenated alu minium alkyl, at least one organic halogen derivative or a halide of an element also able to exist in a lower valency state, and at least one compound containing one or more salifiable hydroxyl groups, ie of acid or neutral type. The new process allows the preparation, both in the absence and in the presence of inert diluents, of conjugate diolefin polymers of linear structure which are essentially entirely 1,4 cis. The method for preparing the new catalytic system is also described.
