# Cementitious compositions and methods of making same.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to an additive composi tion or admixture for incorporation in cementitious composi tions such as concretes, mortars and grouts, neat cement mixes, and dry mixes for the same. These cementitious mixtures are especially suited for application in adverse environments such as undersea, desert, or alkaline soil conditions. The cementitious compositions include Portland cement, refractory cement, an alkaline metal carbonate, a carbohydrate, a fatty acid ester, and preferably a suitable aggregate.
