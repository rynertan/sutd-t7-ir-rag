# Polyepoxide coating compositions containing urea curing agents.

## Abstract
Single package, thermosetting coating compositions contain a polyepoxide and a curing agent system comprising an aromatic urea. At composition curing times and tempera tures, the aromatic urea reacts with a portion of the polyepoxide to form in situ a primary or secondary amine which can then function as a coreactive curing agent to complete the cure of the epoxy resin coating.
