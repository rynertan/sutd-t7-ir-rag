## Description
A METHOD FOR REFINING CRUDE ALDEHYDE PRODUCTS This invention is directed to a method for refining a crude aldehyde product mixture so as to remove an organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies therefrom. The refined aldehyde is then hydrogenated to produce alcohol. It is well known in the art to hydrogenate aldehydes in the presence of metal catalysts to produce alcohols. The hydrogen adds onto the carbonyl group of the aldehyde to form the alcohol. It is also well known that the aldehydes which may be hydrogenated may be derived from conventional oxo processes or aldol condensation methods. For instance commonly popular methods for producing such aldehyde starting materials comprise rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation process such as taught for example by U.S. Patents 3,527,809 4,148,430 and 4,247,486. Such oxo processes involve the hydroformylation of olefins with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the presence of a rhodium complex catalyst and free organophosphorus ligand to produce the aldehyde. The resultant aldehyde products are mixtures of normal and isomer branched chain aldehydes corresponding to the olefin starting material and result from adding a carbonyl group CHO at one of the carbon atoms of an ethylenic group e.g. CH CH2 of the olefin. For instance, the hydroformylation of propylene produces n butyraldehyde rCH3CH2CH2CHo and isobutyraldehyde CH3CH CHo cH3 . In general such hydroformylation processes are preferably designed to produce aldehyde products rich in the normal isomer thereof. As taught in U.S. Patents 4,148,830 and 4,247,486 such continuous hydroformylation processes inherently produce high boiling liquid aldehyde condensation by products, e.g. trimers and tetramers which may serve as a solvent for the hydroformylation process, as well as other liquid heavies.Thus a small amount of such higher boilers along with some amount of the free organophosphorus ligand is always invariably contained in the crude aldehyde product obtained even after separating the initial aldehyde product from its lights e.g.carbon monoxide, hydrogen, alkane by product, etc. as in the case of a continuous gas recycle hydroformylation process or after separating the initial aldehyde product from its lights and catalyst containing solution as in the case of a continuous liquid recycle hydroformylation process.Indeed even after separating the lower boiling iso aldehyde from its higher boiling normal aldehyde counterpart in order to provide only a normal aldehyde product feed for producing higher aldehydes Le.g. 2 ethyl propylacroleinEMI2.1 from n butyraldehyde by conventional aldol condensation such higher aldehyde products may also contain, in addition to the organic heavies of the aldol condensation, the organophosphorus contaminant present in the normal aldehyde product feed. Accordingly, heretofore it has been the conventional procedure in the art to refine the crude aldehyde product resulting from such conventional continuous rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation processes by removing at least about 99 weight percent, and more preferably at least about 99.9 weight percent, of the organophosphorus contaminant and as much of said higher boiling heavies as practical contained in such crude aldehyde product mixtures by distillation prior to vaporizing and hydrogenating the aldehyde and prior to employing such n aldehydes as starting materials for such aldol condensation methods, in order to avoid contamination of the finally desired alcoholic product and or hydrogenation catalyst. However there are two major penalties associated with commercially refining the crude aldehyde product via distillation. The first is the very high energy cost required to operate such distillation procedures on a commercial level.Secondly a significant amount of aldehyde compound is converted into heavies during such distillation procedures due to the high temperatures necessary to remove said organic heavies and organophosphorus contaminants. Indeed it is estimated that about 1.2 percent by weight of aldehyde compound may be lost by its own in situ conversion to heavies that are also substantially removed during such distillation procedures and such is clearly a significant amount in any commerc ial operation.Moreover, not only is there this loss of aldehyde converted to heavies, there is also an additional direct loss of some aldehyde that is removed from the distillation refining system along with the liquid higher boilers and the organophosphorus contaminants.European Patent 0008767 is directed to a heterogeneous vapor phase process for the catalytic hydrogenation of aldehydes to alcohols. A benefit of the hydrogenation process of said EPC 000877 is said to be the low amounts of heavies formation caus ed by the hydrogenation process. Said EPC 00087to further teaches that the aldehyde feed may comprise the aldehyde s proauct or a portion of the product mixture of, e.g. a conventional oxo product stream. U.S. Patent 2,549,416 describes a vapor phase process for hydrogenating crude, semirefined or refined aldehydes by vaporizing same and passing them together with hydrogen over a catalyst comprising reduced copper plus zinc oxide. Said patent also discloses that higher aldehydes may be purified in the vaporizer by separating them from impurities boiling considerably above the boiling point of the aldehyde and removing such impurities as a liquid from the bottom of the vaporization zone. It has now been discovered that it is not necessary to separate the organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies from the crude aldehyde product by distillation refining prior to vaporizing the aldehyde in the presence of hydrogen and that such drawbacks associated with distillation refining of the crude aldehyde product may be overcome or at least greatly minimized by the process of this invention as explained more fully below. Thus it is an object of this invention to provide a novel method for refining a crude aldehyde liquid product mixture, which comprises vaporizing the aldehyde of said liquid product mixture and separating a liquid stream of the organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies therefrom. Other objects and advantages of this invention will become readily apparent from the following description and appended claims. More specifically this invention is directed to a method for refining a crude aldehyde liquid product mixture consisting essentially of from about 95 weight percent to about 99.5 weight percent aldehyde, about 5 to 500 parts per million of an organophosphorus contaminant, the remainder consisting essentially of organic heavies, said method comprising separating the organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies from the aldehyde of said liquid product mixture by vaporizing the aldehyde of said liquid product mixture while in the presence of a hydrogen containing gas and removing from the vaporizer 1 a vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream and 2 a liquid stream of the organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies. The crude aldehyde liquid product mixture employed herein may be obtained by any cosnventional metal preferably rhodium complex catalyzed hydroformylation process conducted in the presence of free organic phosphorus ligand. Such oxo processes and the conditions thereof are well known in the art as illustrated by the preferred continuous liquid recycle process of U.S. Patent 4,148,830 and the preferred continuous gas recycle process of U.S. Patent 4,247,486, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto.Such hydroformylation processes in general involve producing aldehydes rich in their normal isomers by reacting an oleo in with hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas in a liquid reaction medium which contains a soluble rhodium complex catalyst and at least 10 moles of free organophosphorus ligand per mole of catalytically active rhodium and wherein the reaction conditions comprise 1 a temperature of from about 500C to 1500C, preferably 900C to 1200C 2 a total gas pressure of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and olefin of less than 1500 psi a, preferably less than 400 psia and more preferably iess than 350 psia 3 a carbon monoxide partial pressure of less than about 100 psi a, preferably 1 to 50 psi a and 4 a hydrogen partial pressure of less than 400 asia, preferably 20 to 200 psia. In general it is preferred that the amount of free organophosphorus ligand is at least 50 moles, and more preferably at least 100 moles per mole of catalytically active rhodium. Thus as noted herein above the crude aldehyde liquid product mixtures consist essentially of aldehydes, organic heavies and some of the free organic phosphorus ligand employed in the oxo process and obtained after separating the initial aldehyde product from its lights e.g. compounds having boiling points below that of the aldehyde product compounds in the case of a continuous gas recycle hydroformylation process or after separating the initial aldehyde product from its lights and catalyst containing solution as in the case of a continuous liquid recycle hydroformylation process.Of course it is to be understood that while such crude aldehyde liquid product mixtures normally contain both normal straight chain aldehyde and iso branched chain aldehyde and are preferably rich in the normal isomer thereof, if desired, the lower boiling iso aldehyde may be distilled from said crude liquid reaction mixture leaving only or essentially only the normal isomer in said crude liquid mixture. it is to be further understood that such crude liquid product mixtures which contain essentially only a normal aldehyde Isomer, after having removed its iso aldehyde, may be employed as the starting material of any conventional aldol condensation method to produce a higher aldehyde e.g. n butyraldehyde is used to produce 2 ethyl propylacrolein and such crude aldol condensation products may also be employed as starting materials in the process of this invention. Thus the aldehydes in the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture employable herein may contain from 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Illustrative aldehydes include e.g. propionaldehyde, Isobutyr aldehyde, n butyraldehyde, isopentyl aldehyde, n pentylaldehyde, 2 methyl pentyl aldehyde. crotonaldehyde, 2 ethyl hexaldehyde, methyl pentyl aldehyde, 2 ethyl butyraldehyde, acrolein, 2 ethyl propyl acrolein EMI8.1 and the like.The more preferred aldehydes are those containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms especially iso and n butyraldehyde. Further it is to be understood that the organophosphorus contaminant contained in the crude aldehyde liquid product mixtures employable herein consists essentially of the organophosphorus compound, and or its corresponding organophosphorus oxide, which corresponds to the. free organic phosphorus ligand employed in the oxo processes discussed above from whence the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture starting materials of the process of this invention may be derived, as well as any corresponding alkyl substituted phosphorus compounds and or their corresponding oxides, that might be present as a result of their in situ formation or deliberate use during the oxo process. For instance, it is known as seen by U.S.Patent 4,260,828 and 4,297,239 that during the rhodium triphenylphosphine complex catalyzed hydroformylation of propylene to produce butyraldehyde in the presence of free triphenylphosphine ligand that propyldiphenylphosphine is formed in situ. Moreover, it is known that organophosphorus compounds are susceptible to oxidation to their corresponding oxides and that some oxo processes, such as disclosed, e.g. in U.S. Patent 4,221,743, deliberately employ an oxygen containing gas feed to the oxo process system.Thus the organophosphorus oxides that may be present in the organophosphorus contaminant may be as a result of in situ or deliberate oxidation during the oxo process or after the formation of the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture starting materials of this invention. Accordingly, illustrative organophosphorus compounds may Include any organophosphine or organophosphite heretofore advanced for employment in a conventional oxo process. The more preferred organophosphorus compounds will correspond to those free organophosphorus ligands disclosed, e.g. in U.S. Patents 3,527,809 4,148,830 4,221,743 4,247,486 4,260,828 4,283,5b2 4,297,239 and U.S. ApplicationSerial No. 293,190 filed August 17, 1981. In general triorganophosphines, especially triphenylphosphine, are the most preferred free organophosphorus ligands employed in the production of aldehydes via rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation oxo processes. Likewise the organic heavies contained in the crude aldehyde liquid product mixtures employable herein include any organic solvent and organic by products having boiling points above that of the aldehyde product compounds of the oxo process and or aldo condensation from whence said product mixtures are derived such as the liquid aldehyde condensation by products discussed e.g. in U.S.P. 4,148,830 and other common higher boiler by products. As noted above the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture employable herein may consist essentially of at least about 95 to about 99.5 weight percent preferably at least about,97 to about 99 weight percent aldehyde about 5 to about 500 parts per million, more commonly about 10 to about 200 parts per million of organophosphorus contaminant based on the total weight of said liquid product mixture the remainder of said liquid product mixture consisting essentially of organic heavies. The refining process of this invention comprises separating an organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies from the aldehyde contained in a crude aldehyde liquid product mixture by adding said product mixture to a vaporizer and vaporizing the aldehyde contained in said mixture while in the presence of a stream of hydrogen containing gas that is also being added to the vaporizer and removing a vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream from the vaporizer as well as collecting a liquid stream containing the non volatilized organophosphorus contaminant and the non volatilized organic heavies from the vaporizer.In general It is preferred to spray the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture down into a vaporization zone while at the same time passing up into said zone a hydrogen containing gas, said gas containing a portion or all of the hydrogen which is to be used in subsequently hydrogenating the aldehyde after it has been vaporized in the presence of said hydrogen containing gas and has been removed from the vaporizer as a vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream and passed to a hydrogenator or converter employed for said hydrog,enation of the aldehyde to its corresponding alcohol s . Of course it is obvious that the particular. design of the vaporization apparatus is not critical and that any conventional vaporization vessel having suitable means for carrying out the process of this invention may be employed herein.Demister pads are helpful for reducing liquid entrainment. The nonvaporized organophosphorus contaminant and nonvaporized organic heavies present in the liquid product mixture may easily be removed as a liquid stream from the bottom of the vaporization zone e.g. at the same time the vaporized aldehydehydrogen containing gas stream is being removed from the top of the vaporizer or intermittently, if desired. The vaporization of the aldehyde s in the refining process of this invention may take place under such conditions as a temperature in the range of from about 400C to about 1500C, preferably from about O C to about 140 C, and at a pressure in the range of from about 2.4 bar to about 11.5 bar i.e.about 20 psig to about 150 psig , preferably from about 4.5 bar to about 8 bar i.e. about 50 psig to about 100 psig . In addition the mole ratio of hydrogen containing gas to aldehyde s in the vaporizer may be at least about 1 mole of hydrogen per mole of aldehyde starting material. While the upper limit of the amount of hydrogen employable herein is not critical and is primarily dependent only upon obvious practical processing considerations, when such small amounts of hydrogen are employed, It is of course obvious that make up hydrogen which by passes the vaporizer may be added to the vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas after it leaves the vaporizer in order to obtain the most satisfactory hydrogenation results.Thus while as pointed out above the amount of hydrogen in the vaporizer may be a portion or all of the hydrogen to be employed in the subsequent hydrogenation process, it is generally preferred to employ in the process of this invention hydrogen in the range of from about 10 to about 50 moles per mole of aldehyde starting material for such should be suitable in most instances. Moreover the term hydrogen containing gas as used herein obviously includes both essentially pure hydrogen gas as well as gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen, such as mixtures of hydrogen and inert gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the like. Likewise it is to be understood that the heat required for vaporization of the aldehyde compound s may be supplied by any conventional heat exchange means and or by employing super heated hydrogen containing gas and such a latter method is generally preferred. Accordingly it is to be understood that the most optimum conditions of temperature, pressure and ratio of hydrogen feed to aldehyde starting material in the process of this invention will of course depend on the particular aldehyde starting material employed and such optimum conditions may be easily determined by routine experimentation.In general higher vaporizing pressures will require higher temperatures and lower pressures will require lower temperatures. Similarly lower temperatures are obviously preferred for more volatile aldehydes while higher temperatures are preferred for less volatile aldehydes. In general it is preferred to correlate the temperature, pressure and mole ratio of hydrogen to aldehyde starting material in the process of this invention so that at least about 50 percent by weight, preferably at least about 70 percent by weight of the organophosphdrus contaminant present in the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture to be added to the vaporizer is removed, via the liquid steam of organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies, from the bottom of the vaporization tone.Conversely for any particular combination of such conditions as the particular type of aldehyde, vaporizer pressure and mole ratio of hydrogen to aldehyde, the preferred temperature for the vaporization will be that temperature at which essentially all of the aldehyde is vaporized, but not so low as to have excessive aldehyde lost in the liquid tails removed from the vaporizer, nor so high as to vaporize excessive amounts of the organophosphorus contaminant and higher boiling organic heavies of the liquid product mixture starting material. A simple means for determining the preferred temperature for any combination of remaining operating conditions is by analyzing the aldehyde concentration in the liquid tails removed from the vaporizer. Preferably the aldehyde concentration in said liquid tails should range from about 3 to about 65 weight percent and more preferably be from about 5 to 50 weight percent of the total amount of said liquid tails. Such an aldehyde concentration in said liquid tails should correspond in most instances to the preferred process of this invention, i.e. one that tas removed at least about 50 percent by weight, preferably about 70 percent by weight of the organophosphorus contaminant present in the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture to be added to the vaporizer via the liquid stream tails recovered from the bottom of the vaporization zone. Of course removal of said organophosphorus contaminant in said liquid tails obviously also indicates a substantial removal of the organic heavies present in the liquid product mixture as well. The most preferred aldehyde vaporized in accordance with the process of this invention is butyraldehyde which is preferably vaporized at a temperature ranging from about 800C to 950C and a pressure of about 60 psig. The vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream removed from the vaporizer of the process of this invention may be hydrogenated to produce alcohol by any conventional hydrogen process. In general it is preferred to hydrogenate said vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream by passing it to a converter or hydrogenating vessel and hydrogenating the aldehyde by the catalytic hydrogenation process disclosed and described in said above mentioned European PatentSpecification No. 0008767, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. Said hydrogenation process comprises contacting the vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream produced by the process of this invention with a solid catalyst comprising a reduced mixture of CuO and ZnO. The mole ratio of contained hydrogen gas to aldehyde s may be generally from 10 to 50 and the hydrogenation process may be conducted at a temperature of between 110 and 1800C preferably between l30 and 1700C and at a pressure of between 2,4 and 11,5 bar 20 and 150 psig , preferably between 4,5 and 8 bar 50 and 100 psig .Moreover, the hydrogenation process is preferably carried out at a space velocity of between 500 and 4000 hr l space velocity is total volume of aldehyde and hydrogen at standard conditions of temperature and pressure per volume of the catalyst per hour . The hydrogenation process is most conveniently carried out in a continuous manner, although semi continuous or batch operations may also be employed. The reaction zone advantageously is an elongated tubular reactor wherein the catalyst is positioned. The vapors are contacted with the catalyst. The alcohol product from the hydrogenation reaction may be separated from the hydrogen by condensation and the excess hydrogen may be compressed and recycled to the reaction zone. The crude alcohol product may be used in this form or it can be further purified in a conventional manner such as, by fractional distillation. If desired, any unconverted portion of the aldehyde or aldehyde mixture may be separated from the reaction product and recycled to the reaction zone and preferably, admixed with fresh feed gases prior to entering the reaction zone. The refining process of this invention is indeed unique in that it provides for not only a very high energy cost savings due to the elimination of such above described heretofore conventional distillation procedures, but also eliminates or at least greatly minimizes the above discussed loss in aldehyde due to its in situ conversion to heavies that is attendent with such distillation procedures.Moreover, while it might be arguably maintained that one might expect that the organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies may be separated in such a vaporization procedure, it is equally maintainable that one might also expect some of the organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies, due to their large amounts in the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture to be carried along with the vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream removed from the vaporizer and thus adversely affect the performance of the hydrogenation catalyst in terms of the yield of alcohol produced and or purity of the alcohol product of the subsequent hydrogenation process.However, it has been surprisingly found that the yield and purity of an alcohol product produced by employing a vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream as produced by the process of this invention is for all essential purposes substantially the same if not better than that produced from a comparative vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream in which the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture had undergone a conventional distillation procedure as described herein above to remove the organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies prior to vaporization of the aldehyde. in addition, it is considered that any degradation of the life of the hydrogenation catalyst that might be caused by employing a vaporized aldehyde hydrogen containing gas stream produced by the process of this invention as the starting material for the hydrogenation process is more than compensated for by the very high energy cost savings and reduction in aldehyde loss caused by conventional distillation refining as discussed above, that is provided by the process of this invention. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are not to be regarded as limitative. It is to be understood that all of the parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise indicated. EXAMPLES Two crude aldehyde liquid product mixtures produced within a 5 month interval of each other from the same commercial continuous gas recycle rhodium complex catalyzed hydroformylation process of propylene to produce butyraldehyde rich in its normal isomer, said process being conducted in the presence of excess free triphenylphosphine ligand, each mixture having had its lights removed in the same manner, and which are labeled crude aldehyde liquid product mixtures A and B for the purpose of these written Examples, were employed as follows. Crude aldehyde liquid product mixture A was subjected to a conventional distillation refining system using two distillation columns in series to remove its organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies. Table 1 below illustrates the composition of said crude mixture A prior to said distillation, as well as the compositions of the refined aldehyde obtained from each distillation column and the total distillation system tails obtained from the second distillation column. The data in Table 1 shows that about 1.4 weight percent of the aldehyde in the crude aldehyde liquid product mixture A feed to the distillation refining system was lost by being converted in situ into organic heavies during said distillation procedure. The total system tails stream of the second distillation column corresponds to about 2.5 weight percent of the aldehyde contained in said crude aldehyde liquid product mixture A feed. Said total system tails stream of the second distillation column includes the organic heavies made in situ during distillation as well as the organic heavies and the organophosphorus contaminant present in said crude aldehyde liquid product mixture A feed, and a small amount of butyral dehyde. Crude aldehyde liquid product mixture B , which had not been subjected to any distillation refining procedure designed to remove its organic heavies and organophosphorus contaminant, was employed as obtained and fed directly to a vaporizer and the aldehyde contained therein vaporized at about 900C, under about 60 psig, in the presence of hydrogen gas the mole ratio of hydrogen gas to aldehyde contained in said crude al dehyde mixture B feed being about 23 to 1 . Table 2 below illustrates the composition of said crude aldehyde mixture B feed to the vaporizer as well as the composition of the liquid tails stream of organophosphorus contaminant and organic heavies removed from the bottom of the vaporization zone of said vaporizer. The data shows that the total amount of said liquid bottom tails is equivalent to about 1.3 weight percent of the aldehyde in said crude aldehyde liquid product mixture B feed. Such indicates that the process of this invention provided a savings of about 1.2 weight percent of the aldehyde contained in said crude aldehyde mixture B feed as compared to the conventional distillation refining process carried out on said crude aldehyde mixture A above. Finally the distilled refined aldehyde product mixture obtained from the first distillation column of the distillation procedure outlined above and carried out on crude aldehyde liquid product mixture A was vaporized in substantially the same manner and under substantially the same conditions as the vaporization procedure outlined above that was carried out on crude aldehyde liquid product mixture B . Both the vaporized aldehyde hydrogen stream removed from the vaporizer in the case of distilled refined aldehyde product mixture A and the vaporized aldehyde hydrogen stream removed from the vaporizer in the case of crude aldehyde mixture B were then hydrogenated in substantially the same manner and under substantially the same conditions according to the invention procedure of saidEuropean Patent Specification No. 000877 CuO ZnO catalyst peak temperature about 170 C about 60 psig space velocity about 956 hr 1 to produce butanol. A comparison of both crude butanol products is given in Table 3 below.Said data indicates that the yield and purity of both crude butanol products is substantially the same.
