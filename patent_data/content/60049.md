## Description
PRODUCTION OF CYANOGUANIDINE INTERMEDIATES This invention relates to processes for the production of intermediates useful in the preparation of cyanoguanidines. Cyanoguanidines are useful, for instance, as anti ulcer drugs, examples being cimetidine and etintidine. Specifically the present invention is concerned with a process for the preparation of dialkyl cyanodithioimino carbonates, such a process being suitable at plant scale in the commercial production of intermediates for conversion to cyanoguanidines used as pharmaceutical compounds. A known commercial method for the preparation of dimethyl cyanodithioimino carbonate involves the addition of an alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide to a solution of cyanamide in an . alcohol and carbon disulphide. The temperature is kept below 1 and the product is the dipotassium salt of cyanodithioimino carbonate. The isolated dipotassium salt is charged to water and dimethyl sulphate added to the solution, again maintaining the temperature below 150C. The product is dimethyl cyanodithioimino carbonate at an overall yield of about 66 . The above described process requires the use of a mixed alcoholic solvent system in order to obtain a good yield of the dipotassium salt. Accordingly, recovery of the alcohols is difficult and makes the process an expensive one. The dipotassium salt must be isolated and since the material is highly caustic it requires special handling. The process requires the use of potassium hydroxide which is an expensive reagent. The use of alcohols in the preparation of the dipotassium salt leads to the formation of xanthates as by products and thereby reduces the yield which can be obtained. According to the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a dialkyl cyanodithioimino carbonate as an intermediate in the commercial for Dharmaceutical use production of a cyanoguanidine , said dialkyl cyanodithioimino carbonate having the formulaEMI2.1 where each R is independently an alkyl group, the process comprising contacting together, under reaction conditions, alkali, cyanamde, a sulphur providing agent and an alkylating agent, the process being conducted in the absence of any substantial amount of solvent other than water. Preferably R is lower alkyl preferably C1 C4 alkyl and more preferably is methyl. The alkali may be sodium hydroxide and indeed it is an advantage of the process of the invention that sodium hydroxide may be used rather than the more expensive potassium hydroxide. The process of the invention may be carried out without using an organic solvent and, therefore, is essentially much more simple and much less expensive than a process in which a solvent is involved, even if it is possible to recover and recycle the solvent.Furthermore, the avoidance of large quantities of organic solvent means that the batch yield the yield based on the total volume of the batch may be much higher. Furthermore, there is no need for expensive equipment in order to separate duff, S for instance, by distillation, volatile solvents. Preferably the alkylating agent is dialkyl sulphate and more preferably is dimethyl sulphate. Preferably the sulphur providing agent is carbon disulphide. Preferably the process is conducted in the presence of surface active agent. The surface active agent may be non ionic, cationic or anionic wetting agent, an example being the non ionic wetting agent ethoxylated nonyl phenol. The surface active agent may be a phase transfer catalyst such as benzyltrimethylammonium chloride. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature higher than 15 C, thereby allowing advantage to be taken of an increased reaction rate at increased temperature. The process can be carried out as a one pot reaction without the need to isolate the intermediate dirotassium salt or salt for instance, the disodium salt . A preferred process for producing a dialkyl cyanodithioimino carbonate of the formula I as given above comprises contacting together cyanamide, carbon it desired, disulphide and,f√Öa surrace active agent, adding alkali and then an alkylating agent. Preferably the reaction mixture is agitated after the addition of alkali and prior to the addition of alkylating agent until the mixture becomes homogeneous. Preferably the alkylating agent is added at a rate such that the temperature does not rise above about 15 C. More preferably the rate of addition is such that the temperature is maintained between 10 and 15 C. The order of addition of reactants may be varied and the comparative proportions in which the reactants may be mixed together may also be varied. By way of example, alkali may be added to cyanamide followed by addition of the carbon disulphide. In an alternative embodiment, the cyanamide may be first mixed with the carbon disulphide and alkali subsequently added. It is, however, important to ensure as far as possible that undesirable by products are not formed, and in this respect an unacceptable product is obtained if oils are formed during the process. It is preferred that the first stage of the process, namely, the formation of the anion, prior to the addition of alkylating agent, be carried out in such a way that the cyanamide and alkali are in contact for the shortest possible time.In the case where alkali is being added to a mixture of cyanamide and carbon disulphide, the alkali should be added as quickly as possible, the temperature of the reaction mixture being allowed to rise, as a result of the fast alkali addition, to a comparatively high temperature, the limit being the boiling point of the carbon disulphide 44 C . It has been surprisingly discovered that very high yields of the desired product can be obtained, without significant amounts of undesirable by products, as a result of this comparatively high temperature reaction as long as the alkali is added over a short period. A preferred short period is up to one and a half hours but instead of adding the alkali to a mixture of cyanamide and carbon disulphide it is possible to achieve the same result, that is avoidance of a prolonged period of contact between the cyanamide and alkali, by adding to the CS2 simultaneously both cyanamide and alkali. In this case the reactants can be added at any rate as long as they only come into contact in the presence of the carbon disulphide.Again the temperature may be allowed to rise up to a temperature belo that of the boiling point of carbon disulphide in order to achieve a fast reaction rate.Fast addition of the reactants will in itself cause the reaction temperature to rise. Examples of processes in accordance with the present invention will now be described. EYSuMPLE I Sodium hydroxide 40g. was dissolved in 230 ml.water and added to 50 aqueous cyanamide 42g. keeping the temperature between 0 10 C. lg. of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride a phase transfer catalyst was added prior to the addition of the carbon disulphide 34.9g. . The solution was then 0 warmed to 30 C and stirred until it was homogeneous, i.e. all the carbon disulphide had reacted. To the resulting solution dimethyl sulphate l Og. was added keeping the temperature between 20 250C. This was stirred at one hour before heating to 30 C. On cooling back to 15 C the precipitated product was filtered off and dried to give 65g. of the dimethyl cyanodithioimino carbonate 90 yield .EXAMPLE II To a 50 aqueous solution of cyanamide 84g. 1 mole , there are added 200 ml water and carbon disulphide 68.g. 0.9 mole together with Ig. of a phase transfer catalyst benzylWrimethylammonium chloride . The mixture is stirred an heated to 250C.Aqueous sodium hydroxide solution 80.g 2 moles, dissolved in 240 ml water is then added over a period of 1.5 hours, controlling the temperature between 280 and 300C. The mixture is then stirred at this temperature for a further 6 hours giving a clear orange red solution. Dimethyl sulphate 240g. 1.9 moles is then added over a period of 1 hour maintaining the temperature between 20 and 25 0C. When the addition is complete the reaction is stirred for one hour before warming to 350C to destroy an excess dimethyl sulphate.On cooling back to 12 to 15 0C the product is filtered and washed with water two washings of 100 ml each .The product is dried under vacuum to give 120.5g. 82.58 of theory based on cyanamide charge . It has been found that particularly good quality products may be obtained in high yield by conducting the reaction in accordance with the following conditions. On the basis of use of 1 mole of cyanamide 84g, typically in a 50 aqueous solution , there should be added from 150 to 500 ml water. and from 0.8 to 1.0 mole carbon disulphide together with an amount of phase transfer catalyst up to 5g. The mixture should be stirred at a temperature in the range 0 to 30 C. Aqueous sodium hydroxide solution from 1.8 to 2.4 moles dissolved in from 200 to o00 ml water is then added over a period of from 30 minutes to 12 hours preferably less than 2 hours and more preferably a period of from 1 to 1h hours controlling the temperature between 20 and 400C or up to the boiling point of carbon disulphide at 440C . The mixture is then stirred until a homogeneous solution is obtained indicating that all or substantially all the carbon disulphide has reacted , typically taking from 6 to 10 hours. The mixture is then cooled to about OOC and from 1.6 to 2.2 moles of dimethyl sulphate are added, the rate of addition being such that the temperature is allowed to rise to from 10 to 15 C. The addition may typically take from 1 to 5 hours.After completion of the addition the mixture is stirred for a further period, typically about 4 hours. The product is then filtered and washed with water, typically with two washings of 100 ml each. An example of a reaction conducted in accordance with the above mentioned conditions will now be described. A process similar to that described in thisExample has been conducted and found to yield excellent quality products on a laraer scale. To a 500 gallon vessel, 190Kg of 509 aqueous cyanamide, 450Ka water and 155Kg carbon disulphide were added and the mixture warmed with stirring to 250C. 724Kg of 25 aqueous sodium hydroxide was added over a period of from 1 to 1.5 hours,keeping the temperature within the range 28 to 30 C by control of the precise rate of addition.The reaction mixture was then stirred at this temperature until it was homogeneous, the period being approximately six hours. The reaction was then cooled and 543Kg of dimethyl sulphate was added keeping the temperature between 20 and 25 0C. When the additon was complete the reaction mixture was stirred for one hour at 20 to 250C and then heated to 35 to 400C to destroy excess dimethyl sulphate. The contents of the vessel were cooled to 12 to 150C and the product centrifuged, the product being washed while on the centrifuge.EXAMPLE III To a 50 aqueous solution of cyanamide 84g 1 mole there are 200 ml of water and carbon disulphide 68.4g 0.9 mole together with ig benzyltrimethylammonium chloride. The mixture is stirred and heated to 200C. Aqueous sodium hydroxide solution 80g 2 moles dissolved in 240 ml water is then added over a period of 1 hours, controlling the temperature to about 35 C. The mixture is then stirred at this temperature until a homogeneous solution is obtained, this taking about 6 hours. The mixture is then cooled to 0 0C and then dimethyl sulphate 240g 1.9 moles is added. The addition is at a rate such that the temperature is allowed to rise to from 10 to 150c. The addition of dimethyl sulphate takes about 1 hour. After completion of the addition of dimethyl sulphate the mixture is stirred for about 4 hours. The mixture is then filtered and the filtered product is then washed with water two washings of 100 ml each . The product is dried under vacuum and the yield is 131g 90 of theory based on cyanamide charge . The above described Example III was repeated but without the addition of benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, or indeed any other surface active agent.In this case 110g of dimethyl cyanodithioimino carbonate were obtained 75 of theory based on cyanamide charge .
