# Method and apparatus for generating computer controlled interactive voice services.

## Abstract
The present invention describes a Dialog Production System DPS 104 107 for generating computer controlled voice services. The DPS includes interaction modules 1401 1410 in 104, each defining a basic end user transaction which can be performed by the system, and methods for specifying module interconnection. Each interaction module controls the intercommunications with other modules and controls the devices 101 which interface to the voice service users. To design a dialog program to implement the desired voice service the system operator uses a graphic terminal 105 to select and interconnect the modules to define the sequence of transactions needed to implement the desired voice service.
