# COMBUSTION APPARATUS.

## Abstract
A safety device for use in a combustor detects incom plete combustion and suspends the combustion. The safety device employs a sensor 25 of an oxygen concentration cell type which is made of, for example, zirconia. The safety device is arranged such that no voltage is applied to the sensor 25 during ignition, and the ignition is effected with a low air fuel ratio. Thus, when compared with a conventional safety device wherein a voltage is applied to the sensor 25 , the safety device of the invention has a simplified construc tion and a lower production cost, and enables a reliable ignition detection. After ignition, combustion at a normal air fuel ratio is restored and a voltage is applied to the sensor 25 , so that misfiring can be reliably detected.
