# Closures for pressure vessels.

## Abstract
A closure for a large sized opening 102 in a pressure vessel 103 has a lid 101 longitudinally movable between an open position and a covering position in which it is aligned with the opening 102 but spaced apart from it, and perpendicular ly displaceable between the covering position and a sealing position in which it engages the sealing edge 104 of the open ing 103 . The lid 101 is moved by a hydraulic or pneumatic ram 116 between the open and covering positions and is carri ed by rollers 109 mounted on shafts 106, 106a affixed to the lid, which run on longitudinal support surfaces 119 . The shafts 106, 106a are rotatably mounted in bearings 107 fixed to the lid and are coupled together 112, 112a, 113 for si multaneous rotation, while the rollers 109 are eccentric rela tive to the bearings 107 . The ram 116 applies torque to the shafts 106, 106a in one sense during closing movement of the lid 101 and in the opposite sense during opening move ment of the lid 101 . A follower member 120 fixedly secured to one 106 of the shafts engages guide surface 119 to pre vent the shafts 106, 106a rotating during movement of the lid between the open and covering positions. The guide surface has an aperture 123 in it through which the follower member 120 passes when the lid reaches the covering position so that the shafts 106, 106a rotate and the lid 101 is displaced from the covering position to the sealing position by the rela tive eccentricity of the rollers 109 and bearings 107 . A cam surface is provided for guiding the follower member 120 dur ing return displacement of the lid between the sealing position and the covering position.
