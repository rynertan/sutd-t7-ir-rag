# Method for bonding sintered metal pieces.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method for bonding pieces of iron group sintered metal, and more particularly to a method for producing a sintered part having a complicated configur ation by bonding more than 2 iron group sintered metal pieces to each other at the flat faces thereof, wherein through holes 4,5,5 ,24 are provided in predetermined locations of each of the metal pieces except the one 3,23 constituting the lowermost layer, and if necessary, a concave groove 20 having a depth of 0.03 1 mm is provided on the face to be bonded of each layer, the metal pieces 1,2,3,21,23 being superposed with said through holes coinciding with each other, brazing alloy 6,7,26 being inserted into each of the through holes, the whole being heated so as to help said brazing alloy 6,7,26 infitrate into each of the interfaces 8,9 thereby enabling to accomplish bonding of more than 2 pieces of iron group sintered metal to each other at low cost.
