# A method of improving the transmissibility of polymer substrates to visible light by coating with an aqueous emulsion or dispersion containing an ultra violet absorbing scintillator.

## Abstract
This case relates to a method of improving the transmissibility of polymer sheet films to visible light by coating the sheet or film with an aqueous emulsion of an ultra violet absorbing scintillator. Such sheets and films are useful for example in greenhouse construction thereby assisting the growth of plants.
