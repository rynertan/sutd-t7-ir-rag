# Apparatus for supplying taped parts.

## Abstract
An apparatus for use in a system for mounting taped electronic parts 1 on a predetermined portions of ceramics substrates and adapted for supplying the parts 1 to a predetermined portion of the system. The apparatus has a slide table 5 equipped with a tape pay off means 3 and a tape feeding means 8 , a slide table slide means 49, 51 and a power transmission means 44, 47, 48, 28, 62, 66, 29, 31, 36 39 interposed between the stationary table 50 and the slide table 5 , the power transmission means 28, 66, 62 being capable of transmitting power to the tape feeding means 8 even during the sliding of the table 5 , and a switch over means drivingly connected to the power trans mission means and adapted for selectively transmitting power to the tape feeding means 8 , in such a manner that both the selecting operation for selecting the part 1 to be mounted next and the part feeding operation for feeding the part 11 are conducted simultaneously.
