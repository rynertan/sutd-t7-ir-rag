# Coal water slurry composition.

## Abstract
Aqueous coal slurries comprising comminuted coal, water and sulfated O glycoside surfactant. The sulfated O glycoside serves as a highly efficient dispersant for the coal particles, permitting the achievement of low viscosity slurries at low surfactant usage levels.
