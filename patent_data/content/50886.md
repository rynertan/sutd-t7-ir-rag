# Plot generator.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method to be used in an air space surveillance radar for selecting target data by compar ing the target azimuth extent data with the zone related threshold. A plot generator comprising a video processor 2 produces, upon the reception of sensor signals, target data per target, which data are stored in a register 3 . The method aims at protecting the track generator from overloads and is characterised by the following process steps a. to separately store a target azimuth extent threshold for each range azimuth zone b. to convert target angle and range data into a zone related address control signal c. to read out the zone related threshold d. to compare the target azimuth extent data supplied by the video processor 2 with the read out threshold e. to produce an erase signal for the register stored target data if the supplied target azimuth extent data fails to exceed the threshold.
