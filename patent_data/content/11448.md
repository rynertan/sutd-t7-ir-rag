# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device especially a RAM using MOSFETs has its access time dependent upon the length of its word or bit lines. In a device including a plurality of bit lines 4 , a plurality of memory cells 1 each of which is connected to a different bit line 4 , a plurality of common word lines 3 each of which is connected to the memory cells 1 via a transmission gate 2 at least one amplifier 7 is provided between two memory cells 1 which are connected to the same word line 3 or a bit line 4 . This reduces the access time of the memory device by preventing an increase in access time with length of word or bit line.
