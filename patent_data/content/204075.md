# Strap accumulator.

## Abstract
A strap accumulator 18 is disclosed for use between an associated strapping apparatus 10 and a power driven strap dispensing mechanism 14 . The accumulator 18 is configured to receive strap S from the dispenser 14 , with the accumulated strap S being periodically withdrawn by the associated strapping apparatus 10 . The accumulator 18 includes a housing 20 which defines an interior cavity within which strap S is accumulated, with a disc like strap guide 44 mounted generally centrally of the cavity which guides strap S from within the housing 20 through one of the sidewalls 22 or 24 thereof. The generally central mounting of the strap guide 44 within the cavity permits the accumulated strap S to form an elongated loop between the strap guide 44 and an edge wall 26 of the housing 20 without any tendency to disfigure or damage the strap S .
