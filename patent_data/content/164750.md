# ANTIREFLECTIVE COATINGS FOR USE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES, METHODS AND SOLUTIONS FOR MAKING SUCH COATINGS, AND THE METHOD FOR USING SUCH COATINGS TO ABSORB LIGHT IN ULTRAVIOLET PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY PROCESSES

## Abstract
Disclosed are antireflective layers for use in the manu facture of semi conductor devices, methods and solutions for making such antireflective layers, and the use of such antireflective layers to absorb light in ultraviolet photolitho graphy. The antireflective layers that are utilized comprise a polyphenylquinoxaline.
