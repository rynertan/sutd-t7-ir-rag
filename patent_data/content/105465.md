# Process for producing adult T cell leukemia associated antigen.

## Abstract
A process for producing an adult T cell leukemia associated antigen is disclosed wherein an adult T cell leukemia associated antigen producing cell is treated with a surfactant. A method for assaying adult T cell leukemia associated antibodies by enzymoimmunoassay, radioimmu noassay or passive hemagglutination is also disclosed. In this method, the adult T cell leukemia associated antigen obtained by treating the adult T cell leukemia associated antigen producing cells with a surfactant is used as the antigen in the assay procedure.
