## Abstract
Process for direct drilling heavy or compacted soil comprising first killing the weeds and thereafter drilling into substantially undisturbed soil wherein the porosity of the soil is improved before drilling by making a series of adjacent substantially parallel diagonal cuts therethrough to fissure the body of the soil without substantial disturbance of the surface. Also claims a blade 1 for carrying out such fissuring with a hinged extension 2 on the trailing edge set at an adjustable angle to increase the soil fissuring as required according to soil type. Crumble rollers 44, 45, 46 may be located between adjacent blades to provide impact blows or pressure upon the temporarily raised soil lifted up by the soil fissuring blades. Alternatively angled cutting knives 79 on rotating shafts 80 may follow the fissuring blades.
