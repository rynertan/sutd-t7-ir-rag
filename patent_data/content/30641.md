# INSULATING COATING FOR CERAMIC SUBSTRATE AND METHOD TO FORM SUCH A COATING

## Abstract
The blanket or selective coating consists of polyimide 12 and of between about 28 and about 84 by weight of mica platelets 10 . To produce the coating a solution of a polyamic acid containing between about 9 and about 45 by weight of mica is applied to the substrate 14 either uniformly or through a screen having a desired pattern. The solvent is removed and the resulting layer is cured into a solid adhering coating. The coating is preferably used to insulate current carrying metal patterns disposed on ceramic substrates onto which silicon chips with integrated circuits are mounted.
