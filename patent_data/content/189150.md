# Process and apparatus for producing carbon fibers.

## Abstract
When preparing carbon fibers from mesophase pitches, are usually encounters the formation of cracks along the fiber axis. The crack formation is the most serious and troublesome problem. A simple process and apparatus which can effective ly prevent the crack formation are disclosed. The process is that when preparing the carbon fibers from mesophase pitches by melt spinning, it is sufficient only to give a rotatory motion to the molten mesophase pitches just before extrusion substantially around the axis of a spinning nozzle hole 3 . The apparatus is essentially the same as a usual nozzle plate 1 having a pitch introducing tube 4 and a spinning nozzle hole 3 provided that the apparatus further contains a plug member 2 having an outer spiral groove 7 such as a drill point or a worm gear and the plug member 2 is inserted into the pitch introducing tube 4 .
