# PLASMID PSAN 81 AND A PROCESS FOR ITS EXTRACTION FROM A CELL CULTURE

## Abstract
A novel plasmid, named pSAN 181, has a molecular weight of 5 0.2 megadaltons and single cleavage sites for each of the restriction endonucleases BamHI, Pstl, Xhol and BgIII, the positions of said sites being 0, about 0.85, about 1.15 and about 3.95 megadaltons from the cleavage site of BamHI. The plasmid is extracted from mycelia of microor ganisms of the species Streptomyces fulvoviridis, especially the strain Streptomyces fulvoviridis FERM P 6279, and is useful as a vector for genetic engineering.
