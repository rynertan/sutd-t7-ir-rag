## Description
The present invention relates to a process for producing L tryptophan using In a process for producing L tryptophan using microorganisms, where it is attempted to produce L tryptophan using carbohydrates such as glucose or the like as raw materials, wild strains do not produce L tryptophan outside of cells and thus, there is known a process which comprises artificially causing mutations of wild strains in order to impart L tryptophan productivity to the wild strains. As hitherto known mutants having L tryptophan productivity, there are known mutants of the genus On the other hand, some attempts to utilize recombinant DNA techniques different from the above mentioned breeding involving mutations have also been reported recently. For example, in Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 38 2 , 181 190 1979 , it is described that a particular mutant of Furthermore, it is mentioned in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application 208994 82 that L tryptophan is produced using a microorganism belonging to the genus On the other hand, many processes for producing L tryptophan using anthranilic acid or indole as a raw material are known for example, Published Examined Japanese Patent Applications 16955 71, 46348 72 and 29584 82, Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Applications 00785 73, 87085 73 and 95484 75, etc. Further, there is also known a process for producing L tryptophan from indole or anthranilic acid using bacteria belonging to the genus Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing L tryptophan more effectively and in higher yields than in the prior art processes. It is another object of this invention to make available The present inventors have succeeded in obtaining The In addition to the A method for isolating the TS gene comprises first extracting chromosomal DNA containing the TS gene from A wide variety of restriction enzymes can be used for cleaving the chromosomal gene while controlling the degree of cleavage through a control of the reaction time for the cleavage. Any plasmid vector can be utilized in the present invention, as long as it is capable of proliferating in The vector DNA is digested with the same restriction enzyme as that used for digestion of the chromosomal DNA or they are digested with different enzymes, then connected to oligonucleotides having complementary base sequences at both termini of the chromosomal DNA and vector DNA fragments, and the vector and chromosomal DNA fragments are then subjected to a ligation reaction. For introducing the thus obtained recombinant DNA made up of the chromosomal DNA and plasmid DNA into recipient bacteria belonging to In the protoplast or spheroplast technique, sufficiently high frequency of transformation can be obtained even by the above described process used for After transformation, strains which have acquired TS activity and which express a marker gene of the vectors are obtained as transformants. Such transformants have recombinant DNA containing TS genes. To isolate the recombinant DNA, the transformed cells are lysed, for example, by a treatment with lysozyme and SDS, treated with phenol to denature proteins, then 2 volume parts of ethanol are added thereto to precipitate and recover DNA. The process for producing L tryptophan using the thus obtained The first case is to produce L tryptophan using carbohydrates as raw materials. Namely, as a medium a conventional medium containing carbohydrates as a carbon source, nitrogen sources, inorganic ions and, if necessary, further containing organic trace nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, etc., may be used. As the carbohydrates, glucose, sucrose, fructose, lactose, etc., and starch hydrolysates, whey, molasses, etc., may be used. As the nitrogen source, ammonia gas, ammonia water, ammonium salts and others may be employed. The cultivation is carried out generally for 2 to 4 days until the production and accumulation of L tryptophan are substantially finished, while appropriately controlling the pH of the medium and temperature under aerobic conditions. Thus, marked amounts of L tryptophan are produced and accumulated in the medium. The second case is where indole or anthranilic acid is added to the medium as used in the first case at the time of instruction of cultivation, or to the medium during cultivation. This case is similar to the first one in that L tryptophan is produced under conditions where Anthranilic acid or indole may be incorporated into the medium from the outset of cultivation or may be incorporated into the medium during cultivation, particularly after Cultivation of The third case is very similar to the second case in that anthranilic acid and indole are used as raw materials for producing L tryptophan but is different from the first one in that L tryptophan is produced under such conditions where the propagation of As a medium for propagating After cultivation, These bacterial cells or treated products are added to an aqueous medium together with anthranilic acid or indole in order to produce L tryptophan. It is advantageous that the bacterial cells or treated products be used in an amount of from 0.5 to 5 g dl dry basis calculated as the amount of the cells. In a case where a culture broth per se is used as the source of bacterial cells, the culture broth may be used as it is or it may be diluted with water, etc. In a case where the bacterial cells once separated or treated products are used, phosphate buffer may be used or only water may be used. Further addition of sodium sulfite, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, pyridoxal phosphate or organic solvent such as acetone, ethanol, etc., surface active agents, etc., to the suspension may often provide better results. Further, when inosine is added to aqueous medium, a substantially insoluble tryptophan inosine complex is formed so that tryptophan is removed from the reaction solution and thus, the reaction tends to proceed more toward the production of L tryptophan. A preferred concentration of anthranilic acid or indole is 0.1 to 5 g dl in the case of anthranilic acid and 0.1 to 4.5 g dl in the case of indole. When anthranilic acid is used as the raw material, a ribose donor selected from ribose, 5 phosphoribose, 1 phosphoribose and 5 phosphoribose pyrophosphate is added to the aqueous medium. It is preferred that the ribose donor be in an amount of from 0.1 to 5 g dl in any case. When anthranilic acid is added as a substrate in a high concentration, it is desirable to accordingly increase the concentration of these additives. When indole is used as the raw material, an alanine side chain donor or pyruvic acid and ammonium ions are added to the aqueous medium. The alanine side chain donor is represented by the following general formula As referred to in this application, alkylmercapto or alkoxy means a group having preferably one to six carbon atoms in the alkyl portion. Further, benzyl groups benzyloxy or thiobenzyl may be unsubstituted or substituted with hydroxyl, halogen or C₁ C₆ alkyl or alkoxy on the aromatic ring. The amount of each of the alanine side chain donor and pyruvic acid is 0.1 M to 1M. In the reaction for producing L tryptophan, the aqueous medium may be shaken and reacted at 25 C to 45 C for 10 to 48 hours in the case of anthranilic acid. Further, in the case of indole, it is preferred that the aqueous medium be settled or reacted by mildly shaking at 25 C to 45 C for 5 to 48 hours. The culture solution obtained by the first, second and third cases or L tryptophan produced in the aqueous medium may be separated and harvested in a conventional manner. The invention now being generally described, the same will be better understood by reference to certain specific examples which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention or any embodiment thereof, unless specified. As a vector, pAJ 1844 molecular weight, 5.4 megadaltons was used. Its DNA was prepared as follows The chromosomal DNA, 20 µg, obtained in 1 and 10 µg of the plasmid DNA obtained in 2 were treated with restriction endonuclease Pst I at 37 C for 30 minutes. After heat treatment at 65 C for 10 minutes, the two reaction solutions were mixed with each other and, the mixture was subjected to a ligation reaction of DNA fragments with T₄ phage derived DNA ligase at 10 C for 24 hours in the presence of ATP and dithiothreitol. After heat treatment at 65 C for 10 minutes, a 2 fold volume of ethanol was added to the reaction solution to precipitate and harvest DNA. As the transformation method, a protoplast transformation method was used. First, the cells were cultured in 5 ml of CMG liquid medium to reach an earlier logarithmic growth phase. After adding 0.6 unit ml of penicillin, shake culture was conducted for an additional 1.5 hour. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 0.5 ml of SMMP medium pH 6.5 composed of 0.5M sucrose, 20 mM maleic acid, 20 mM magnesium chloride and 3.5 Pennassay browth Difco and then suspended in SMMP medium containing 10 mg ml of lysozyme. The suspension was treated at 30 C for 20 hours to obtain protoplasts. After centrifuging at 6000 x g for 10 minutes, the protoplasts were washed with SMMP and resuspended in 0.5 ml of SMMP. The thus obtained protoplasts were mixed with 10 µg of DNA prepared in 3 in the presence of 5 mM EDTA. After polyethylene glycol was added to the mixture to reach the final concentration of 30 , the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 minutes to incorporate DNA into the protoplasts. After the protoplasts were washed with 1 ml of SMMP medium, they were resuspended in 1 ml of SMMP and the suspension was cultured at 30 C for 2 hours for phenotypic expression. The culture solution was spread onto a protoplast regeneration medium of pH 7.0. The regeneration medium contained, per one liter of distilled water, 12 g of tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, 0.5 g of KCl, 10 g of glucose, 8.1 g of MgCl₂.6H₂O, 2.2 g of CaCl₂.2H₂O, 4 g of peptone, 4 g of yeast extract powder, 1 g of Casamino Acid Difco Co., Ltd. , 0.2 g of K₂HPO₄, 135 g of sodium succinate, 8 g of agar and 3 µg ml of chloramphenicol. After culturing at 30 C for 2 weeks, about 10,000 colonies resistant to chloramphenicol appeared, which were replicated in tryptophan free medium Trp deficient medium which contained 2 of glucose, 1 of ammonium sulfate, 0.25 of urea, 0.1 of dihydrogen potassium phosphate, 0.04 of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 1 mg dl of FeSO₄.7H₂O, 1 mg dl of MnSO₄.4H₂O, 200 µg dl of thiamine hydrochloride and 50 µg dl of biotin, pH 7.0, 1.8 of agar, and 3 strains which were resistant to chloramphenicol and tryptophan independent were obtained. From the transformant, a lysate was prepared by the method described in 2 . When plasmid DNA was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, a plasmid obviously larger than the vector was detected. It was confirmed that the TSA gene was present on the recombinant plasmid in the transformant. This strain was named AJ 12139 and the recombinant plasmid was named pAJ 319. Further, by introducing pAJ 319 into B 5 strain defficient for the β subunit of TS hereafter simply referred to as TSB , tryptophan auxotropy disappeared similarly as described above, whereby it was clarified that trp A and trp B genes were present on the 3.0 Kb fragment inserted at the pst I site of pAJ 1844. A specimen strain was cultured in 20 ml of medium for L tryptophan production described hereinafter . From the cultured cells, a lysate was prepared by an ultrasonic wave treatment and centrifuged at 32,000 x g for 30 minutes to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant was used as a crude enzyme solution. Using an enzyme reaction solution 1 ml in total amount consisting of 100 mM tris hydrochloride buffer pH 7.8 , 0.4 mM indole, 30 mM L serine, 40 µm pyridoxal 5 phosphate and 180 mM sodium chloride, TSB activity was measured. The reaction was carried out at 30 C for 30 minutes, 0.1 ml of 1M NaOH was added, the remaining indole was extracted with toluene, color was then formed by an indole reagent and then the color was measured by a spectrophotometer at 540 nm . The results are shown in Table 1. It was observed that the specific activity of TS of the transformant AJ 12139 FERM P 7750, FERM BP 847 was about 11 times larger than that of the wild strain AJ 12036 FERM P7559, FERM BP 734 and it was confirmed that the TS activity of the transformant was inhibited only slightly even in the presence of 20 mM L tryptophan. From the AJ 12139 strain described above, recombinant plasmid pAT 319 was extracted by the process of 2 and introduced into L tryptophan producing strain M 247, which was derived from AJ 12036 strain as a 5 fluorotryptophan resistant strain by the transformation process described in 4 . Transformants were selected which were chloramphenicol resistant. The thus obtained transformants named AJ 12140 FERM BP 846 and M 247 were cultured and L tryptophan productivity was examined. The results are shown in Table 2. The cultivation was performed by inoculating specimen strains in 3 ml of a medium in test tubes or 20 ml in shoulder equipped flasks. The medium contained 130 g of glucose, 25 g of NH₄ ₂SO₄, 12 g of fumaric acid, 3 g of acetic acid, 1 g of KH₂PO₄, 8 mg of MgSO₄.4H₂O, 1 µg of MgSO₄.7H₂O.50 µg of biotin, 2000 µg of thiamine hydrochloride, 650 mg of tyrosine, 400 mg of DL methionine and 50 g of CaCO₃ in 1 liter of water. Shaking was carried out at 30 C for 72 hours. After culturing, L tryptophan in the supernatant was quantitatively assayed by microbioassay. See Table 2. pAJ 319 plasmid was introduced into Transformant AJ 12141 FERM P7748, FERM BP 845 was cultured under the culture conditions as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 3. The aqueous medium contained in 1 liter 100 g of glucose, 40 g of NH₄ ₂SO₄, 1 g of KH₂PO₄, 0.4 g of MgSO₄.7H₂O, 2 ppm of Mn² , 300 µg of biotin, 200 µg of thiamine hydrochloride, 1 g of Casamino acid, 10 ml of Aji eki and 50 g of CaCO₃ and the pH was 7.2. See Table 3. AJ 12140 and AJ 12141 obtained in Examples 1 and 2, respectively, were cultured in a medium supplemented with anthranilic acid or indole. The results are shown in Table 4. Culture conditions were the same as in Example 1 part 7 . Anthranilic acid was added in an amount of 0.5 after 48 hours from the initiation of the culture. On the other hand, indole was fed in portions in a total amount of 0.5 during 48 to 72 hours. As controls, host strains M 247 and AJ 11560 used in Examples 1 and 2 were cultured under the same condition. Further, the result obtained by culturing each strain in a medium supplemented with neither anthranilic acid nor indole are also shown in Table 4 One platinum loop volume of bacterial cells shown in Table 5 was inoculated into 50 ml of CMG medium charged in a 50 ml flask equipped with shoulder followed by culturing at 30 C for 20 hours. Chloramphenicol 10 µg ml was added for AJ 12140 and AJ 12141. Cells were collected by centrifuging 1 liter of the culture broth and resuspended in 1 liter of 0.1 NH₄Cl NH₄OH buffer pH 0.0 containing 20 g of anthranilic acid and 20 g of 5 phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The mixture was shaken at 37 C for 20 hours. The amount of L tryptophan accumulated is shown in Table 5. Both strain AJ 12140 and AJ 12141 shown in Table 6 were cultured under the same culture conditions as in Example 4. Cells were collected by centrifuging 1 liter of the culture broth and were resuspended in 100 ml of a reaction mixture shown in Table 6 having a composition of 0.1 g dl of Na₂SO₃, 0.3 g dl of EDTA, 0.01 g dl of pyridoxal phosphate and 5.4 g dl of inosine pH 8.5 as basic ingredients. The suspension was reacted at 30 C for 8 hours. The results are shown in Table 6. Plasmid pAJ 1844 used as a vector in the present invention was deposited in the Institute of Microorganism Technology in the form introduced in Further, No. 21 strain and M 247 strain used in Example 1 can be obtained from AJ 12139 and AJ 12140, respectively, by eliminating composite plasmids from host cells without impairing the host cells according to the following technique. Plasmids may be spontaneously lost from the host or may be eliminated by a removal operation Bact. Rev., In addition, No. 21 strain and M 247 strain may be obtained from AJ 12139 and AJ 12140, respectively, by the following technique. Namely, each transformant deposited is subcultured on a CMG plate several times, and separated colonies are examined by a chloramphenicol resistance test on chloramphenicol sensitive colonies. The existence of a plasmid is examined by the process described in Example 2, part 2 . A strain having no plasmid is either No. 21 strain or M 247 strain.
