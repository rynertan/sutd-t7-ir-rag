## Description
This invention relates generally to read start pulse generators. Read start pulse generators in accordance with the invention may, for example, be employed in image signal processing systems, for example in time base correctors of video tape recorders. An image signal processing system, such as a video tape recorder, usually incorporates a time base corrector that causes a reproduced video signal to be written once in a memory, after analog to digital A D conversion, and then read from the memory in synchronism with a stable reference pulse signal before digital to analog D A conversion. The video signal, the time base of which thereby has been corrected, is outputted together with a synchronising signal, a burst signal and a blank pulse signal all included in the reference pulse signal. In order to write or read the reproduced video signal in or from the memory, the time base corrector includes a write clock generator and a read clock generator. The write clock generator generates a write start pulse signal to designate each head address of each scanning line in the memory and a write clock signal to increment the address sequentially in writing the video signal and the read clock generator generates a read start pulse signal to designate each head address of each scanning line in the memory and a read clock signal to increment the address sequentially in reading the video signal. In a time base corrector shown in Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings and described in detail hereinbelow, it is necessary to allow a memory controller shown at 5 in Figure 1 to be able automatically to adjust the timing i.e. the phase of generating the write start pulse or the read start pulse in order repeatedly to write or read the video image signal data for each scanning line in or from the memory with good reproducibility. Further, in writing or reading the video signal data in or from the memory, it is necessary to write or read the data corresponding to one cycle of a colour subcarrier signal as a unit in order to maintain continuity of the colour subcarrier phase in the memory. That is, it is necessary to synchronise the timing of generating the write or read start pulse signal with that of the colour subcarrier signal. In the case of an NTSC National Television System Committee type system, since the frequency of the subcarrier is set to be 455 2 times the line frequency, it is necessary to shift the phase of the write or read start pulse by 1 2 of the period about 140ns of the colour subcarrier for each scanning line. In practice, in order to generate the write and read start pulses, an automatic phase controller APC usually is incorporated in each of the read clock generator and the write clock generator. Incidentally, in a video tape recorder for broadcasting stations, there is a need for a read clock generator by which the phase of the synchronising signal or the burst signal can be adjusted by any given phase shift relative to the station s reference signal, where necessary, in order to enable matching with another system connected to the time base corrector. Therefore, since a previously proposed read clock generator of a time base corrector is provided with various adjusting devices such as a horizontal synchronisation phase adjusting device, a colour subcarrier phase adjusting device, and a hue adjusting device, in addition to the horizontal synchronisation colour subcarrier phase adjusting device, if the foregoing adjusting devices are operated after the horizontal synchronisation colour subcarrier phase adjusting device has been operated, a problem arises in that the horizontal synchronisation colour subcarrier phase adjusting device needs to be adjusted again. That is, it is impossible to operate the other adjusting devices independently, thus giving rise to a complicated time base corrector adjusting operation. The arrangement and the operation of the previously proposed read clock generator mentioned above is described in detail hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. According to the invention there is provided a read start pulse generator of an automatic colour subcarrier synchronising phase controller type for receiving a read horizontal synchronising signal and a read subcarrier signal both adjustably phase shifted by predetermined values from a reference horizontal synchronising singal and a reference burst signal both separated from a reference pulse signal, the read start pulse generator comprising The invention also provides a read start pulse generator of an automatic subcarrier synchronising phase controller type for receiving a reference horizontal synchronising signal and a reference burst signal both separated from a reference pulse signal, the read start pulse generator comprising Preferred embodiments of the present invention described hereinbelow provide read start pulse generators incorporated with a read clock generator of a time base corrector for a video tape recorder, for instance, in which it is unnecessary to readjust the automatic phase controller for colour subcarrier synchronisation even after the horizontal synchronisation phase, subcarrier phase, and or hue have been adjusted. The invention will be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like references designate the same or similar elements throughout, and in which To facilitate understanding of embodiments of the present invention described hereinbelow, a previously proposed read start pulse generator will first be described in detail with respect to its application to a time base corrector TBC incorporated within an image signal processor, for instance a video tape recorder. Some image signal processors, such as video tape recorders VTRs , usually employ a time base corrector such as that shown in Figure 1 in which a reproduced video input signal VDIN is first converted into a corresponding digital signal by an analog to digital A D converter 4, stored in a memory or memory unit 6, read from the memory 6 in synchronism with a stable reference pulse signal VDREF and converted again into a corresponding analog signal by a digital to analog D A converter 8 as video data. In more detail, a reproduced synchronising signal SYNC is separated by a synchronisation separator 1 from the reproduced input signal VDIN, reproduced from a tape, and is applied to a write clock generator 2. Further, a reproduced burst signal BURST is separated from the reproduced input signal VDIN by a burst separator 3 and also is applied to the write clock generator 2. The write clock generator 2 generates a write clock signal WCK and a write start pulse signal WZERO in synchronism with the reproduced synchronisation signal SYNC and the reproduced burst signal BURST, both of which have time base fluctuations. The write clock signal WCK is applied to the A D converter 4 as a sampling pulse signal and is applied also to a memory controller 5, together with the write start pulse signal WZERO. In response to the write start pulse signal WZERO, the memory controller 5 designates each head address of each scanning line in the memory 6 and thereafter writes image signal data for each scanning line i.e. for each 1H in the memory 6 in sequence by sequentially incrementing the address in response to the write clock signal WCK. The data written in the memory 6 is read in response to a read clock signal RCK and a read start pulse signal RZERO generated by a read clock generator 7 in response to the reference pulse signal VDREF having a stable period. That is to say, the memory controller 5 designates each head address of the memory area at which data for each scanning line is stored in response to the read start pulse signal RZERO, and thereafter reads image signal data for each 1H in sequence from the memory 6 by incrementing the address in response to the read clock signal RCK. The image signal data is converted into analog signals by the D A converter 8, which is driven in response to the read clock signal RCK, and then is outputted to a phase adjuster 9. The phase adjuster 9 sends out a reproduced output signal VDOUT by adding a synchronising signal SYNCX, a burst signal BURSTX, and a blank pulse BLKX which are all included in the reference pulse signal VDREF within the read clock generator 7. In the time base corrector as shown in Figure 1, it is necessary for the memory controller 5 automatically to adjust the timing i.e. the phase at which the head addresses are designated so that the head data of the image signal can repeatedly and reliably be written in or read from the memory area having predetermined head addresses whenever image signal data for each scanning line is written in or read from the memory 6. In this connection, an important point to note is that it is necessary to write or read data corresponding to one cycle of a colour subcarrier of the video signal as one unit when writing or reading image signal data in or from the memory 6, in order to maintain continuity of the phase of the colour subcarrier in the memory 6 and, additionally, to provide for easy matching with the processing in the circuitry employed in reading. Therefore, in the memory controller 5, it is necessary to synchronise the timing, at which the write start pulse signal WZERO or the read start pulse signal RZERO is generated, with the colour subcarrier. However, in a colour television system of the NTSC National Television System Committee type, since the frequency of the colour subcarrier is 455 2 times the line frequency and, therefore, the phase of the subcarrier between two sequentially adjacent scanning lines is shifted by 1 2 of a cycle, it is necessary to shift the phases of the write start pulse signal WZERO sent from the write clock generator 2 and the read start pulse signal RZERO sent from the read clock generator 7 by 1 2 of a period about 140 ns of the colour subcarrier for each scanning line. In this case, since the phase of the write start pulse signal WZERO and the phase of the read start pulse signal RZERO are both shifted by 1 2 of a period for each scanning line, the image signal data read from the memory 6 can perfectly be restored in phase relationship between writing and reading. In practice, in order to generate the write start pulse signal WZERO and the read start pulse signal RZERO so that they both have the phase difference described above, an automatic phase controller APC circuit is provided in each of the write clock generator 2 and the read clock generator 7. Incidentally, VTRs for broadcasting stations use a read clock generator 7 as shown in Figure 2, in which, in order to effect matching with a device provided at a succeeding stage, the phases of the horizontal synchronising signal and the burst signal can be adjusted by any given phase difference value from the reference pulse signal VDREF i.e. a reference signal of the station where necessary. The read clock generator 7 of this type will now be described with reference to Figures 2 and 3. In a horizontal synchronising signal forming circuit or generator 7A, a horizontal synchronising signal HSYNCR included in the reference pulse signal VDREF is separated in a synchronisation separator 11 and then supplied to a phase comparator 12. A horizontal synchronisation frequency oscillator 13 of a voltage controlled oscillator VCO type supplies an oscillation output HCOSC, having a frequency nfH which is n times higher than the horizontal synchronisation frequency fH to a signal generator 14. In response to the oscillation output HCOSC, the signal generator 14 generates a horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNC which is supplied to the phase comparator 12 after the phase has been adjusted by a phase adjuster 15 made up of a phase shifter. The phase comparator 12 feeds back a phase error voltage PHE1 representing the phase difference between the horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNC supplied from the phase adjuster 15 and the reference horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNCR to the horizontal synchronisation frequency oscillator 13 in order to control the oscillation frequency of the oscillator 13 so that the phase error voltage PHE1 becomes zero. Therefore, the horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNC provided by the signal generator 14 has a phase shift corresponding to a phase difference produced by the phase adjuster 15 relative to the phase of the reference horizontal synchronising signal HSYNCR. The phase adjuster 15 includes a horizontal synchronisation phase adjusting device 16. The phase shift value of the adjusting device 16 can be adjusted freely by an operator operating the adjusting device 16 where necessary. As described above, it is possible freely to determine the phase difference between the horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNC and the reference horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNCR. Further, in the case of the previously proposed arrangement, the signal generator 14 outputs a synchronisation signal SYNCX and a blank signal BLKX made up of a horizontal synchronising signal HD and a vertical synchronising signal VD synchronised with the horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNC. The horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC is supplied to an automatic phase controller APC 7B for colour subcarrier synchronisation. The APC 7B receives the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC directly at one switch input terminal P1 of a switch circuit 22 and receives it also at another switch input terminal P2 of the same switch circuit 22 after it has been delayed by 1 2 of a period i.e. 140 ns by a delay circuit 23. The switch circuit 22 operates to switch the switch input terminals P1 and P2 for each 1H section in response to a sequential line switching signal LAL, the logical level of which is inverted for each 1H period on the basis of the reproduced horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC. The horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC is delayed by 1 2 of a period of the colour subcarrier for each 1H section through the delay circuit 23 and then inputted as a trigger signal to a timer circuit 24 made up of two monostable multivibrators. The timer circuit 24 generates a timer output MODH indicative of time points near time points at which the read start pulse signal RZERO should be generated on the basis of the timing of the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC. As shown in Figure 3 at A2 to E2 , which refer to an n th scanning line L N , a pulse of the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC Figure 3 B2 is received at a time point to through the switch input terminal P1 of the switch circuit 22 to cause the timer output MODH to rise to logic level 1 as shown in Figure 3 D2 . Thereafter, the timer circuit 24 operates in such a way that the timer output MODH falls to logic level 0 at a time point t1 just prior to a time point t2 at which the read start pulse signal RZERO should be generated Figure 3 E2 . The timer output MODH is supplied to a latch circuit 27. The latch circuit 27 operates in response to a read subcarrier signal RSC provided by a read signal generator or forming circuit 7D on the basis of an oscillator output BCOSC of a colour subcarrier frequency oscillator 26 in a colour subcarrier signal generator or forming circuit 7C. By virtue of this, at a timing corresponding to the time point t2 Figure 3 at which the burst signal BURST Figure 3 C2 generated on the basis of the ocillation output BCOSC crosses zero in a positive going sense, the logic level of the timer output MODH is latched by the latch circuit 27. Therefore, the read start pulse signal RZERO, which is obtained at an output terminal of the latch circuit 27, falls from 1 to 0 at the time point t2 because the timer output MODH falls to 0 at the time point t1 immediately before the time point t2, so that the reading of data from the memory 6 begins in response to this trailing edge. On the other hand, with respect to the N 1 th scanning line L N 1 , the timer circuit 24 receives the horizontal synchronisation signal HSYNC as a trigger signal through the delay circuit 23 and the switch input terminal P2 of the switch circuit 22. Therefore, as shown in Figure 3 D1 , the timer circuit 24 generates a timer output MODH which rises at a time point which is delayed by the delay time 140 ns of the delay circuit 23 from the time point to. Thereafter, the timer output MODH falls to logic 0 at a time point t3 immediately before a time point t4 at which the read start pulse signal RZERO should be generated. In this case, the phase of the burst signal BURST is delayed by 1 2 of a period of the colour burst signal which corresponds to the delay time of the delay circuit 23 as compared with the case shown in Figure 3 C2 . Therefore, the time at which the timer output MODH of the timer circuit 24 falls occurs immediately before the read start pulse signal RZERO in the cases of both the N th and N 1 th scanning line. The timer output MODH is compared with the read subcarrier signal RSC by a phase comparator 28. The read subcarrier signal RSC is formed by the read signal generator 7D on the basis of the burst signal BURST formed by the colour subcarrier signal generator 7C. In the colour subcarrier signal generator 7C, a burst separator 31 separates the burst signal included in the reference pulse signal VDREF in response to a gate signal GATE supplied from the synchronisation separator 11, the resultant burst signal BURSTR being applied to a phase comparator 32. The colour subcarrier frequency oscillator 26, which is of a voltage controlled oscillator VCO type including a quartz oscillator, provides the oscillation output BCOSC which has a frequency 4fsc four times higher than the colour subcarrier frequency fsc, which output is divided by a 1 4 divider 33 and supplied to the phase comparator 32 as the burst signal BURST through a phase adjuster 34. Then, a phase error voltage PHE2 obtained by the phase comparator 32 is fed back to the colour subcarrier frequency oscillator 26 to cause it to provide an oscillation output BCOSC for allowing the phase error voltage PHE2 to become zero. The phase adjuster 34 is made up of phase shifters and includes a subcarrier phase adjusting device 35. When the operator adjusts the adjusting device 35, the phase difference between the burst signal BURSTX and the separated burst signal BURSTR can be adjusted freely on the basis of a phase difference value in the phase adjuster 34. The burst signal BURSTX is supplied to a phase adjuster 41, made up of phase shifters and included in the read signal generator 7D, in order to shift the phase thereof, and then the frequency thereof is multiplied by four in a 4 1 multiplier 42. Therefore, the read clock signal RCK, having a frequency 4fsc four times higher than the colour subcarrier frequency, is outputted from an output terminal of the 4 1 multiplier 42. The read clock signal RCK is supplied to a 1 4 divider 43, so that the read subcarrier signal RSC, having the frequency fsc of the colour subcarrier, can be obtained from an output terminal of the divider 43. An output of the phase adjuster 41 is applied to the 1 4 divider 43 as a reset signal to synchronise the operation of the divider with the burst signal, the phase of which is adjusted by the phase adjuster 41, so that the phase of the read subcarrier signal RSC is synchronised with the output of the phase adjuster 41. The phase adjuster 41 is supplied by an adder 45 with an addition output or sum of an adjustment output applied from a hue adjusting device 44 as a phase adjusting signal and a velocity error signal VER. Therefore, the phase differences between the read clock signal RCK and the burst signal BURSTX and between the read subcarrier signal RSC and the burst signal BURSTX can be adjusted on the basis of the adjustment output of the phase adjusting device 44 and the velocity error signal VER. As described above, the phase comparator 28 of the APC 7B for colour subcarrier synchronisation compares in phase the trailing edges of the timer output MODH Figure 3 D2 and D1 with the zero crossing points of the burst signal BURST Figure 3 C2 and C1 , generates a phase error output PER indicative of the phase difference between the two, and applies the output PER to the timer circuit 24 as a timer time control signal. At this moment, the timer circuit 24 operates in a state in which the phase error output PER indicates a small advance phase difference previously determined relative to the zero crossing points of the burst signal BURST. The thus phase controlled timer output MODH is applied as input data to the latch circuit 27 which is operative to latch at the zero crossing points of the burst signal BURST and outputs a read start pulse signal RZERO falling to logic level 0 at the time points at which the burst signal BURST crosses zero. Therefore, the read start pulse signal RZERO can be generated securely, being synchronised with the zero crossing points of the burst signal BURST, because the timer output MODH is allowed to fall to logic level 0 immediately before the time points i.e. t2 and t4 at which video signal data should start to be read from the memory 6. Since the zero crossing points of the burst signal BURST are generated for each period, where the phase difference between the timer output MODH and the read subcarrier signal RSC is too great a problem can arise in that the trailing edges of the read start pulse signal RZERO are stabilised at zero crossing points other than the points immediately before the image signal data. To solve the above mentioned problem, the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B shown in Figure 2 is provided with a capacitor 51 and a switch circuit 52 at an output terminal of the phase comparator 28 in order to hold the phase error output PER and to supply a predetermined voltage level e.g. ground voltage through the switch circuit 52. The switch circuit 52 is on off controlled by a detection output of an APC return level detector 54 through an OR gate 53. When the signal level of the phase error output PER is beyond a pull in enable range, the capacitor 51 is grounded via the switch circuit 52 in order to return the phase error output PER to ground potential. In this connection, since the stable points of a phase pull in loop controlled by the output of the phase comparator 28 are switched for each scanning line by the switch circuit 22, a problem arises in that it is impossible always to pull in the timer output MODH at the phase immediately before the time point t2 or t4 shown in Figure 3. Further, a problem arises in that it is impossible to pull in the timer output MODH in the case where the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC is not continuous due to dropouts or phase jump. As described above, when the phase error output PER of the phase comparator 28 changes to values at which pull in operation is impossible, the APC operation is returned to the normal operating state by the phase error output PER being locked forcibly to zero volts by the APC return level detector 54 and the switching circuit 52. In this way, when the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC is returned to the normal state, since the timer output MODH of the timer circuit 24 is returned to the nearest stable point zero crossing points of the burst signal , it is possible securely to reproduce the phase of the read start pulse signal RZERO. In the above manner, however, in the case where the timer output MODH falls at time points corresponding to the midpoints in phase between two stable points existing for each period of the burst signal BURST, two stable points occur. In practice, in manufacturing the timer circuit 24, tolerance or dispersion in the timer delay time inevitably is present, whereby a problem arises in that an improper timer circuit can be used. In this case, the read start pulse signal RZERO cannot be generated with a single phase, thus causing an insufficient result in the case where the phase of the video signal must be reproduced strictly, such as when reproduced video signals are edited. To overcome the above mentioned problem, in the case of the previously proposed read clock generator shown in Figure 2, the timer circuit 24 is composed of a first monostable multivibrator 55 having a sufficiently long timer delay time and a second monostable multivibrator 56 having a sufficiently short timer delay time, for instance as short as about one period of the burst signal, and the phase error output PER of the phase comparator 28 is supplied to the first monostable multivibrator 55 through a buffer 57 as a timer time control signal. Further, a horizontal synchronising colour subcarrier phase adjusting device 58 is provided for the second monostable multivibrator 56, so that the timing of the trailing edge of the timer output MODH can finely be adjusted by the adjusting device 58. In this case, the switching circuit 52 is arranged to be turned on by an adjustment mode signal ADJ via the OR gate 53. Further, the timer output MODH and the burst signal BURST are applied to a window detector 59 to light up a display element 60 when the phase difference lies within a predetermined window range. The window detector 59 detects that the phase of the timer output MODH is in close proximity to the stable points i.e. any one of zero crossing points of the burst signal BURST. When the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B is configured as described above, it is possible to adjust the phase of the trailing edge of the timer output MODH to be near the stable point by means of the phase comparator 28 and the APC return level detector 54 before the APC operation. That is, a timer time control signal of ground potential level is applied to the first monostable multivibrator 55 of the timer circuit 24 by applying an adjust mode signal ADJ to the switch circuit 52 through the OR gate 53 to turn on the switch circuit 52 and thus discharging the capacitor 51 for holding the phase error output of the phase comparator 28 to ground potential via the switch circuit 52. At this moment, the multivibrator 55 is controlled so as to have a timer or delay time of lock in operation. In this state, the timer or delay time of the second monostable multivibrator 56 is adjusted by operating the phase synchronising colour subcarrier phase adjusting device 58 to light up the display element 60. As a result, once the display element 60 is illuminated, it is possible to adjust the phase of the trailing edge of the timer output MODH generated during this adjustment to be near a stable point at which the phase should be locked to a plurality of stable points of the burst signal BURST. Once the state where the display element 60 is lighted up is obtained, the adjust mode signal ADJ is switched to a normal operation state which is indicated by logic level 0 to switch the switch circuit 52, whereby the mode is switched to the APC operation based on the phase comparator 28 and the APC return level detector 54. At this moment, since the timer output MODH has been adjusted to be near a stable point of the burst signal BURST, it is possible readily to pull in the timer output MODH to the stable point. However, the previously proposed read clock generator shown in Figure 2 involves the following problems. In the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B shown in Figure 2, after the timer circuit 24 has been adjusted by adjusting the horizontal synchronising colour subcarrier phase adjusting device 58, whenever the horizontal synchronising phase adjusting device 16 of the synchronising signal generator 7A is adjusted, or the subcarrier phase adjusting device 35 of the colour subcarrier signal generator 7C is adjusted, or the hue adjusting device 44 of the read signal generator 7D is adjusted, the adjustment condition that the display element 60 is illuminated by the output of the window detector 59 is destroyed, thus giving rise to a problem in that the timer circuit 24 needs to be adjusted again. The above description indicates that it is impossible independently and freely to adjust the timer circuit by means of the horizontal synchronising phase adjusting device 16, the subcarrier phase adjusting device 35 and the hue adjusting device 44, thus causing a complicated TBC adjustment operation. A description will now be given, with reference to Figure 4, of a first embodiment of the invention residing in a read start pulse generator included in a read clock generator. The read clock generator of Figure 4 is generally similar to that of Figure 2, as is shown by employing the same references for elements and sections corresponding to elements or sections of Figure 2. Consequently, the read clock generator of Figure 4 will be described only in so far as it differs from that of Figure 2. In the case of Figure 4, the configuration of the timer circuit 24 of the APC 7B for the colour subcarrier synchronisation is different from that shown in Figure 2. That is to say, in the read clock generator shown in Figure 4, the output of the switch circuit 22 is supplied to the monostable multivibrator 55 through a phase adjuster 65 made up of phase shifters, and outputs of the horizontal synchronising colour subcarrier phase adjusting device 58 and a phase adjust signal generator 66 are supplied through an adder 67 to the phase adjuster 65 as a phase adjust signal. An adjust signal CON1 provided by the horizontal synchronising phase adjusting device 16 of the synchronising signal generator 7A, an adjust signal CON2 obtained by the subcarrier phase adjusting device 35 of the colour subcarrier signal generator 7C, and an adjust signal CON3 obtained by the hue adjusting device 44 of the read signal generator 7D, are supplied to the phase adjust signal generator 66. Further, a phase control signal CONT is supplied to the phase adjuster 65 via the adder 67 in such a way as to have a value which prevents the signal supplied to the phase comparator 28 of the APC 7B for colour subcarrier synchronisation as a comparison input from being changed in phase when each adjusting device 16, 35 and 44 is operated to effect an adjustment. Further, in the case of Figure 4, a phase adjuster 70 is disposed between the signal generator 14 and phase adjuster 15 of the synchronising signal generator 7A. The phase adjuster 70 is composed of a phase shifter 71 for stepwise adjustment of the phase in time steps i.e. 280 ns of one period of the burst signal, a switching circuit 72 for manually switching output taps of the phase shifter, and a 1 4 divider 73 for dividing by four the output of the horizontal synchronising frequency oscillator 13 and for outputting a clock signal CK to the phase shifter 71, an output obtained at an output terminal of the switching circuit 72 being supplied to the phase adjuster 15. The phase adjuster 70 functions as an adjustment element for adjusting the phase difference between the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC and the reference horizontal synchronising signal HSYNCR in cooperation with the horizontal synchronising phase adjusting device 16. When a phase shift value of one i.e. 280 ns or more periods of the burst signal is required, a coarse phase adjustment can be effected for each 280 ns by switching the output taps of the switching circuit 72 and, further, a fine adjustment of 280 ns or less can be effected by the horizontal synchronising signal adjusting device 16. The phase adjuster 15 can employ the circuit configuration shown in Figure 5. That is to say, a frequency input signal SO supplied from the phase adjuster 70 is received by a sawtooth wave generator 75 which outputs a sawtooth wave output S1 Figure 7 A having the period H of the horizontal synchronising signal. The sawtooth wave output S1 rises in level at a predetermined slope roughly during one period of the colour subcarrier frequency so as intermittently to generate a triangular portion during each period H. The sawtooth wave output S1 is compared with the adjust signal CON1 supplied from the horizontal synchronising phase adjusting device 16 by a comparator 76. During the time interval in which the sawtooth wave output S1 is of higher level than the adjust signal CON1, an output signal S2 Figure 7 B outputted from an output terminal of the comparator 76 rises to logic level 1 . Therefore, when the signal level of the adjust signal CON1 is changed by operating and adjusting the phase adjusting device 16, it is possible to change in a controlled manner the timing at which the output signal S2 rises in level from 0 to 1 that is, the phase during the time interval of the period H . The phase adjusters 34, 41, and 65 can employ the circuit configuration shown in Figure 6. In the same way as in the phase adjuster 15 Figure 5 , the phase adjusters 34, 41, and 65 receive a frequency input signal S10 which is applied to a sawtooth wave generator 77. A sawtooth wave output S11 Figure 8 A of the generator 77 is compared by a comparator 78 with the adjust signal CON2 supplied from the subcarrier phase adjusting device 35, the adjust signal CON3 supplied from the hue adjusting device 44, or an adjust signal CON4 supplied from the horizontal synchronising colour subcarrier phase adjusting device 58 in order to output a comparison output S12 Figure 8 B . In this case, since the frequency input signal S10 has a signal waveform in which triangular waves are repeated continuously with a period Tsc of the colour subcarrier frequency fsc, the comparison output S12 can be changed by controlling the phase of the leading edge at which it changes from logic level 0 to logic level 1 during the period Tsc according to the signal levels of the adjust signal CON2, CON3 or CON4. In the configuration as described with reference to Figure 4, the read clock generator 7 can be adjusted in the same way as was described with reference to Figure 2. That is, the phase difference between the reference horizontal synchronising signal HSYNCR included in the reference pulse signal VDREF and the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC is first adjusted by using the phase adjuster 70 and the phase adjusting device 16 both included in the synchronising signal generator 7A. At this time, a coarse adjustment can be effected in units of one or more periods i.e. 280 ns of the burst signal by switching the coarse phase difference by switching the switching circuit 72 of the phase adjuster 70. In addition, a fine adjustment of less than one period can be effected by adjusting the phase adjusting device 16 of the phase adjuster 15. Further, by adjusting the phase adjusting device 35 of the colour subcarrier signal generator 7C, the phase difference between the burst signal included in the reference pulse signal VDREF and the burst signal of the TBC output is adjusted as occasion demands. A range of adjustment of one period of the burst signal, that is within plus or minus 140 ns, is sufficient for the phase adjusting device 35. Further, by adjusting the phase adjusting device 44 of the read signal generator 7D, the phase difference bewteen the burst signal included in the reference pulse signal VDREF and the chrominance signal of the TBC output is adjusted. In this case, a range of adjustment of one period of the chrominance signal, that is within plus or minus 140 ns, is sufficient for the phase adjusting device 44. After these adjustments, the switching circuit 52 of the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B is turned on in response to the adjustment mode signal ADJ, and the phase difference between the horizontal synchronising signal and the colour subcarrier is set by adjusting the phase adjusting device 58 when the phase error output PER of the phase comparator 28 is zero. This setting is continued until the display element 60 is lighted up. Thereafter, when the switching circuit 52 is turned off by switching the adjustment mode signal ADJ to the normal mode, it is possible to realise a state in which the timer output MODH of the timer circuit 24 follows the phase of the read subcarrier signal RSC whereby it is possible to send out a read start pulse signal RZERO of good reproducibility from the latch circuit 27 of the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B. In the state in which the system is pulled into this APC operation, if it is required to adjust the phase difference between the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNCR of the reference pulse signal VDREF and the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC, a coarse adjustment is first made by switching the switching circuit 72 of the phase adjuster 70 in the synchronising signal generator 7A, and then a fine adjustment is made by using the phase adjusting device 16. In this state, the oscillation frequency of the horizontal synchronising frequency oscillator 13 can be controlled by the phase error output PHE1 of the phase comparator 12 in the synchronising signal generator 7A in accordance with the above adjustment operation, so that the phase of the horizontal synchronising signal SYNCX can be changed or controlled relative to the phase adjuster 9 Figure 1 of the time base corrector. In this case, however, since the adjust signal CON1 supplied from the phase adjusting device 16 to the phase adjuster 15 is supplied also to the phase adjust signal generator 66 so that the phase shift value of the phase adjuster 65 is changed or controlled, the phase adjuster 65 operates so as to compensate for the value corresponding to the change in phase of the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC as a result, the phase error output PER obtained at the output terminal of the phase comparator 28 is kept unchanged. In this connection, since the adjustment in the phase adjuster 70 is made in units of the burst signal period, only the adjustment value i.e. within the phase difference of plus or minus 140 ns on the basis of the adjustment signal CON1 supplied from the phase adjusting device 16 is generated by the phase comparator 28 as an effective value. Further, when it is required to change the phase difference between the burst signal BURST included in the reference pulse signal VDREF and the burst signal BURSTX of the output video signal VDOUT, it is sufficient to change the phase shift value of the phase adjuster 34 by operating the adjusting device 35. In this state, since the oscillation frequency of the colour subcarrier frequency oscillator 26 is changed by a value corresponding to the adjust signal CON2, it is possible to adjust the phase of the burst signal BURSTX. Further, since a change corresponding to that of the adjust signal CON2 is produced in the control output signal CONT of the phase adjust signal generator 66, the phase shift value of the phase adjuster 65 can be changed. As a result, although the phase of the timer output MODH supplied to the phase comparator 28 changes, the phase of the read subcarrier signal RSC supplied from the read signal generator 7D also changes according to the change of the burst signal BURSTX. Therefore, no change is produced in the phase error output PER of the phase comparator 28 due to the adjustment of the phase adjusting device 35, so that the APC 7B maintains the state in which the phase is locked. Thus, as described above, it is possible to adjust the phase of the colour subcarrier without changing the timing of the read start pulse signal RZERO. Further, when it is required to change the hue of the chrominance signal included in the output video signal VDOUT, it is sufficient to adjust the hue adjusting device 44 of the read signal generator 7D. In this case, the change produced in the adjust signal CON3 of the phase adjusting device 44 changes the phase shift value of the phase adjuster 41 through the adder 45, so that the phases of the read subcarrier signal RSC and the read clock signal RCK can be changed for control. Further, in this case, since the adjust signal CON3 of the phase adjusting device 44 changes or controls the phase shift value of the phase adjuster 65 through the phase adjust signal generator 66, it is possible to adjust the hue without producing a change in the phase error output PER of the phase comparator 28, so that the phase locked state can be maintained unchanged in the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B. Therefore, in the system configuration shown in Figure 4, even if the horizontal synchronising phase adjusting device 16, the subcarrier phase adjusting device 35 and the hue adjusting device 44 are adjusted independently, it is possible to maintain unchanged the phase locked state in the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B. Therefore, it is not necessary to readjust the horizontal synchronising colour subcarrier phase adjusting device 58 in the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B, as described above in the case of the previously proposed read clock generator shown in Figure 2, after the adjusting devices 16, 35, 44 have been operated. The operation of the read clock generator shown in Figure 4 will now be described. Figure 9 shows a read clock generator in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The read clock generator of Figure 4 is generally similar to that of Figure 2, as is shown by designating elements and sections corresponding to elements and sections shown in Figure 4 by the same reference numerals. Consequently, the read clock generator of Figure 9 will be described only in so far as it differs from that of Figure 4. In the case of Figure 9, the adjust signals CON1, CON2, and CON3 are not supplied to the phase adjuster 65 of the timer circuit 24. Instead, the system configuration is such that the phase adjustment is made at a rear stage of the APC loop. That is to say, in the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B of Figure 9, the frequency output S21 supplied from the phase adjuster 34 to the phase comparator 32 of the colour subcarrier signal generator 7C is supplied also to the phase comparator 28, the window detector 59 and the latch circuit 27, to all of which the timer output MODH is supplied. The frequency output S21 is in synchronism with the burst signal BURSTR separated from the reference pulse signal VDREF on the basis of the phase pull in operation due to the phase comparator 32. Therefore, the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B operates so as to synchronise the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC obtained by the synchronising signal generator 7A with the burst signal of the reference pulse signal VDREF. On the other hand, in the same way as in Figure 4, the system configuration is such that the phase adjuster 70 including the phase shifter 71, the switching circuit 72 and the divider 73 is disposed between the signal generator 14 and the phase adjuster 15. Therefoer, when the switching circuit 72 is switched, it is possible coarsely to adjust the phases of the horizontal synchronising signal SYNCX the blank signal BLKX HD and VD signals and a field signal FIELD all obtained from the signal generator 14 by switching the switching circuit 72. Additionally, fine phase adjustment within one period of the burst signal that is, within plus or minus 140 ns can be made by the horizontal synchronising phase adjusting device 16. However, in contrast to the arrangement shown in Figure 4, in the arrangement of Figure 9 the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC sent to the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B can be taken from the input terminal of the phase comparator 12 on the oscillation frequency signal side. Therefore, if the adjusting device 16 is adjusted, the phase of the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC does not change. Therefore, the point at which the phase of the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC is synchronised with the reference horizontal synchronising signal HSYNCR is different from that shown in Figure 4. Further, the output 27Q of the latch circuit 27 of the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B is not used directly as the read start pulse signal RZERO, but instead is supplied to a phase shifter 82 provided in a phase adjuster 81 and driven by the frequency output S21. In like mannr to the phase shifter 71 of the phase adjuster 70, the phase shifter 82 has a plurality of phase outputs having different phase shift values within one period of the burst signal. These phase outputs are selected by a switching circuit 83, the operation of which is linked with that of the switching circuit 72, and then supplied to a phase shifter 84. In the phase shifter 84, the phase shift value within plus or minus 140 ns within one period of the burst signal is controlled by a control signal supplied from a phase adjust signal generator 85. The adjust signal CON2 of the subcarrier phase adjusting device 35 and the adjust signal CON3 of the hue adjusting device 44 are supplied to the phase adjust signal generator 85. When a predetermined phase difference is produced relative to the phase of the burst signal BURSTR obtained from the reference pulse signal VDREF by the adjust signals CON2 and CON3, a control signal corresponding to this phase shift value is supplied to the phase shifter 84 in order to shift the phase of the output 27Q of the latch circuit 27. The output 27Q, the phase of which is thus adjusted by the phase adjuster 81, is supplied to an output latch circuit 90. The read subcarrier signal RSC is supplied as a drive signal to the output latch circuit 90. In this way, a read start pulse signal RZERO synchronised with the read subcarrier signal RSC is outputted from the output latch circuit 90. In the arrangement shown in Figure 9, the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B synchronises the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC, the frequency signal of which is in synchronism with the horizontal synchronising signal HSYNCR separated from the reference pulse signal VDREF, with the frequency output S21 synchronised with the burst signal BURSTR separated from the reference pulse signal VDREF on the basis of the APC loop in the comparator 28. Further, the APC 7B latches the phase which is the reference of the read start pulse by means of the latch circuit 27. When the phase of the colour burst is adjusted by using the phase adjusting device 35 or the phase of the hue is adjusted by using the phase adjusting device 44, the latch output 27Q is shifted by the phase adjuster 81 by a phase shift value corresponding to that mentioned above. Therefore, the phase of the latch output 27Q is adjusted by the value corresponding to the phase differences produced in the read subcarrier signal RSC and the read clock signal RCK due to the phase adjusting devices 35 and 44, and is latched by the latch circuit 90 in synchronism with the read subcarrier signal RSC. Here, the phase of the read start pulse signal RZERO is maintained while maintaining the phase pull in status obtained in the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B. As a result, it is not necessary to readjust the colour subcarrier synchronising APC after the phase adjusting devices 35, 44 have been adjusted, in contrast to the system configuration as shown in Figure 2. In the case of the arrangement shown in Figure 9, when the phase of the horizontal synchronising signal is adjusted in the synchronising signal generator 7A, since the phase shifter 71 and the switching circuit 72 are provided for adjusting the phase of the colour burst signal in units of periods and the phase shifter 82 and the switching circuit 83 are provided on the output side of the APC 7B so as to be linked with the phase shifter 71 and the switching circuit 72, even if the phase of the horizontal synchronising signal is adjusted by a phase shift value several times greater than the period of the colour subcarrier, it is possible securely to adjust the phase of the read start pulse signal RZERO. In the state where the automatic phase controller 7B for colour subcarrier synchronisation locks the phase between the read horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC and the read subcarrier signal RSC in an optimum phase relationship, when the phase relationship between the read horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC and the read subcarrier signal RSC is offset by operation of the phase adjusting devices 16, 35, and 44 so as to deviate from the optimum phase relationship, since the offset can be cancelled out by the phase adjusting means 24 and 81 it is possible securely to maintain the optimum phase relationship locked by the automatic phase controller 7B for colour subcarrier synchronisation. Therefore, when the phases of the read horizontal synchronising signal HSYNC and the read subcarrier signal RSC are adjusted by the phase adjusting devices, it is possible to obtain a predetermined phase with sufficient reproduction, whereby it is possible to obtain a good reproducible output image signal VD from the memory. The embodiments of the present invention described above provide that, after the phases of the horizontal synchronising signal and the burst signal have been adjusted to the optimum phase in the colour subcarrier synchronising APC 7B, even if the phase of the horizontal synchronising signal, the burst signal or the chrominance signal of the output video signal is adjusted by any given phase shift value relative to the phase of the horizontal synchronising signal, the burst signal or the chrominance signal of the reference pulse signal VDREF, it is nonetheless possible to obtain a read start pulse generator by which it is possible securely to maintain the optimum phase synchronisation relationships between the horizontal synchronising signal and the burst signal without any need for any other complicated operations.
