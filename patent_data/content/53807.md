# Method and apparatus of injecting replenished electrolyte fluid into an electrolytic cell.

## Abstract
In a filter press membrane chloralkali electrolytic cell having a plurality of electrodes with an external anolyte gas liquid disengager in fluid flow communication with each anode via conduit means having a first predetermined cross sectional area utilized to recirculate electrolyte from the disengager to each anode and electrolyte replenisher means connected to the disengager and each anode, there is provided an improved electrolyte recirculation system wherein the electrolute replenisher means includes a plural ity of feed pipes which are inserted individually within the conduit means thereby causing each feed pipe to be in fluid flow conmmunication with each anode, each feed pipe further extending a predetermined distance into the conduit means from within the disengager and having a second predeter mined cross sectional area such that the outlet of flow of replenishing electrolyte is into the flow of recirculated electrolyte within the conduit means to effect maximum mixing of the fluids prior to entering each anode.
