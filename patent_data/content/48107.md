## Description
CRYSTALLINE PROSTAGLANDINS The present invention relates to crystalline forms, which can be substantially pure, of prostaglandin derivatives. The prostaglandins and their derivatives are well known organic compounds derived from prostanoic acid, which are useful for a variety of pharmacological purposes.See for example, Bergstrom et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 20 1 1968 , and U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,158,667. A trivial system of nomenclature has been devised which classifies prostaglandin derivatives based on the substituents around the cyclopentane ring. See, for example N.A. Nelson, J. Med. Chem. 17 911 918 1974 .This system of nomenclature has been extended to compounds such as that of the formulaEMI1.1 which is one of a class of prostaglandin derivatives known as the prostacyclins. The compound of the given formula may be named 9 deoxy 6,9 epoxy PGF2a, methyl ester, or prostaglandin I2, methyl ester. For a further discussion of the prostacyclins, see U.S. Patent Specificiation No.4,158,667 and Pace Asciak et al., Biochem. 10 3657 1971 .Such compounds will be named herein under the PGI nomencalture. In the given formula, the broken lines of attachment to the solid cyclopentane ring and to the sidechain indicate substituents in the alpha configuration, i.s below the plane of the ring. Heavy solid line attachments indicate substituents in beta configuration, i.e. above the plane of the ring. A method for preparing crystals of prostaglandin 12, methyl ester is disclosed in U.S. Patent SpecificationNo. 4,158,667. Johnson et al., J.A.C.S. 100 24 1978 , disclose that the said method produces prostaglandin 12, methyl ester as soft crystals having a melting point of 30 33 C. The sodium salt of prostaglanding 12, methyl ester is disclosed in Derwent Farmdoc Nos. 5711Y 33, 81213Y 46 and 29115A 16, German Offenlegungsschrift 2720999, and Johnson et al., Prostaglandins 12 915 1976 . A first novel product of the present invention is a substantially pure crystalline form of prostaglandin 12, methyl ester, characterised in that it exhibits a melting point of from 54.7 to 60.60C has razed in ethanol of 96 0 104 C 1.0333 and exhibits IR peaks in a mineral oil mull essentially at 3451, 3393, 2922, 2855, 2724, 2682, 1794, 1744, 1711, 1697, 1687, 1457, 1450, 1437, 1417, 1377, 1361, 1352, 1333, 1316, 1286, 1282, 1265, 1240, 1228, 1206, 1175, 1163, 1133, 1127, 1108, 1084, 1069, 1052, 1041, 1022, 1008, 988, 973, 955, 910, 892, 857, 833, 827, 814, 781, 755, 727, 721, 707, 663 and 613 cm 1. A scond novel product of the present invention is a free flowing, substantially pure form of prostaglandin 12 sodium salt characterised in being greater than 99.0 percent pure by weight, using HPLC analysis. A pharmaceutical composition according to the invention comprises, in addition to an inert carrier, a first or second product as defined above, or prostaglandin 12, sodium salt, which is greater than 99.0 percent pure by weight, using HPLC analysis, obtained from prostaglandin 12, methyl ester. The novel pure form of prostaglandin I2, methyl ester is useful for the same purposes as are disclosed inU.S. Patent Specification No. 4,158,667. Because of its greater purity, the compound is easier to handle and is relatively stable. This makes it a superior compound for formulating into pharmaceutical compositions. Further, prostaglandin 12, methyl ester is an in ternediate for the preparation of the sodium salt of this methyl ester which is yell known and useful pharmacological agent. The substantially pure nature of the prostaglandin 12, methyl ester of the present invention allows for the preparation of a purer form of the sodium salt than can be prepared from the known lower melting, less pure, form of prostaglandin 12, methyl ester. Further, the highpurity of the methyl ester of the present invention allows for the preparation of the sodium salt in a faster and less expensive way. best The previously known method for preparing the sodium salt from the low melting methyl ester is to treat it with sodium carbonate under carefully controlled conditions. A purer form of the sodium salt is prepared from the purer form of the methyl ester by reacting it with sodium hydroxide under much less controlled conditions. The problem with using the less pure form of the methyl ester is that it is difficult to measure the precise amount of starting material in order to determine the precise amount of hydrolyzing agent to be added. Thus, sodium carbonate is used to avoid excess base which would tend to decompose the product.However, the purer methyl ester may be measured more precisely and thus the exact amount of the sodium hydroxide may be used, thereby providing a simpler and less expensive means of obtaining a purer form of the sodium salt of prostaglandin 12, methyl ester. Prostaglandin 12, methyl ester and its sodium salt are formulated into suitable pharmaceutical compositions in the manner given in U.S.Patent 4,158,667. Because of the improved purity of the compounds of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions therefrom represent substantially purer pharmaceutical compositions which cannot be obtained from the previously known compounds. The less pure soft crystalline form of prostaglandin 12, methyl ester is prepared according to the method of U.S. Patent 4,158,667 andJohnson et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 100 24 1978 . Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the prostaglandin I2, methyl ester thus formed can be substantially purified to crystals having a higher melting point and greater degree of optical rotation than is disclosed in the prior art, by the method described herein. The preparation ofcompounds of the present invention is illustrated in the following Examples.Example 1 Preparation of substantially pure prostaglandin I2, methyl ester. A 5 1 three necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and heating means is charged with 2085 ml of toluene and heated to 50 C. 700 ml of 1,5 diazobicyclo 5.4.O undec 5 ene DBU are added. 407 g of 5 5 iodo 9 deoxy 6, 9ar epoxy PGFla, methyl ester are added. After a few minutes,the temperature rises to 62 C and a precipitate begins to separate. The mixture is placed under nitrogen and stirred at 45 50 C overnight. The mixture is assayed by TLC to determine the presence of starting material. The mixture is cooled to 400 C and transferred to a wash tank where it is washed with four 2 1 portions of water containing small amounts of sodium chloride. A small amount of triethylamine is added after each wash. The combined water washes are back extracted with 500 ml of toluene, and the combined organic material is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. 10 g of activated charcoal are added and the mixture is filtered and divided into two equal portions. Each portion is concentrated using a rotary vaporizing apparatus equipped with water aspirator at 380 C to yield two portions containing 164 and 149 g of an orange oil. The total time involved is less than two hrs for each portion. Each concentrate is dissolved in 100 ml of ether containing a few ml of triethylamine. Hexane is added slowly to each portion until the mixture becomes cloudy and then 100 ml of ether is added. This procedure is continued until each solution contains about 500 ml of ether. The total combined volume of each of these portions is about 3 1. If substantially pure prostaglandin 12, methyl ester, is available from a previous systhesis the mixture is preferably seeded with these substantially pure crystals. The mixtures are maintained at room temperature for 1 hr while a gelatinous precipitate separates. Hexane is added in small portions at room temperature, to a total volume of 3.7 to 4.0 1. The gelatinous precipitates are filtered. Each precipitate is dissolved in 200 250 ml of ether containing 5 10 1 of triethylamine. Each solution is then diluted with hexane to a slight cloudiness. Once again,if substantially pure prostaglandin 12, methyl ester is available the mixture is seeded. Each mixture is then diluted with hexane to a volume of 2 1.After the precipitates have separated they are collected on a filter.This recrystallization is repeated one or more times until the precipitate is obtained in the form of fine needles having a melting point above 50 C. If the gel remains in the precipitate it is triturated with 1.5 1 of 10 ether in hexane. The combined weight of the two precipitates is 204 g. The combined solids are dissolved in a mixture of 20 ml of triethylamine and 400 ml of ether by warming the mixture gently to 30 C. About 1 1 of hexane is slowly added while the mixture is being stirred until the solution has a persistent cloudiness. The mixture is warmed to about 41 C and stirred under a strong jet of nitrogen to evaporate the solvent and cool the mixture. If pure final product is available from a previous synthesis the solution is seeded at this point. Fine needles begin to separate. When crystallization of good needles is well underway,hexane is gradually added at 27 30 C for a total of 500 ml. Care should be taken not to overcool the mixture as this will cause gel formation. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr and then at 5 C for 2 hr so that the final temperature of the solution is 12 C. The solid is collected on a filter and is dried under nitrogen and finally in a vacuum oven at 30 C overnight. The yield is 198.6 g 66X of fine colorless needles having a melting point of 56.5 to 58.7 C. TLC analysis shows the product to be at least 97 pure having an optical rotation a of 102 C 1.033 g 100 ml of ethanol , and exhibiting IR peaks as shown in the subsequent Table. The IR analysis was undertaken on a mineral oil mull in the range of 3800 600 wavenumbers cm 1 . The spectrum was obtained using a Digilab Model 14D Fourier transform spectrophotometer. The peak tabulation in table was taken from a computer analysis of the spectrum using a Harris 7 computer. The spectrum is shown in the accompanying drawing.

Example 2 Preparation of the substantially pure prostaglandin 12, sodium salt 3.67 g 10.0 mmols of the substantially pure prostaglandin I2, methyl ester, prepared as above is dissolved in 20 ml of methanol and 10.0 ml 10.0 mmols of sodium hydroxide is added using avolumetric pipette. The clear colorless solution is kept at room temperature overnight. The bulk of the solution having a pH of 7.0 is gradually diluted at room temperature with acetonitrile to slight cloudiness and swirled until the cloudiness is replaced with tiny crystals in a clear solution. This was repeated until the volume was 400 ml of a viscous crystal slurry. This slurry is chilled at 50 C for 12 hrs and the fine white crystals are collected, rinsed with acetonitrile and dried on filter paper under nitrogen atmosphere. The yield is 2.78 g 74.3 of prostaglandin I2, sodium salt. HPLC analysis shows that the titled product is 99.84 pure by weight. Carbon hydrogen sodium analysis is 64.44 8.47 6.38.
