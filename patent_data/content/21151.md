# Adaptive defrost control and method.

## Abstract
Apparatus and a method for determining the appropriate time to initiate a defrost cycle in conjunction with a refrigeration circuit having a heat exchanger upon which frost may accumulate. The elapsed time period from a previous defrost cycle is used to adjust the time between defrost cycles such that the time period between defrost cycles is varied as a function of the length of the previous defrost cycle.
