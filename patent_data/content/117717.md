# Improvements in operating quadrupole mass spectrometers in the broadband RF only mode.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a method of operating quadrupole mass spectrometers with only an RF potential applied to the fil ter rods so that the spectrometer operates to pass all ions above a particular value of m e. In practice, spectrometers operated in this way usually show a marked loss in transmis sion efficiency for ions of high m e when operated with an RF potential low enough to pass ions of m e 10, and the inven tion overcomes this defect by providing a method of switching the RF potential between two or more values at which ions of different ranges of m e values are efficiently transmitted, and combining the output signals at each value to give a resultant signal more accurately proportional to the number of ions formed in the source of the spectrometer, irrespective of their m e values. The invention can be used to improve the accuracy of total pressure measurement using a conventional residual gas analysing mass spectrometer, eliminating the need for ad ditional pressure gauges.
