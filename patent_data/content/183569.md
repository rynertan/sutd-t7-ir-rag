# A SEMICONDUCTOR LASER APPARATUS

## Abstract
A semiconductor laser apparatus comprising a semi conductor laser array device 13 in which plurality of laser operation areas are disposed in a parallel manner to attain optical phase coupling therebetween and laser lights are propagated with a 180 phase shift therebetween in the adjacent laser operation areas, resulting in a far field pattern having a peak in each of the two different directions of the emission of said laser lights therefrom, and a stem 11 enclosing said semiconductor laser array device 13 therein in such a manner that one of the said laser lights from said semiconductor laser array device 13 is blocked with the inner wall 14 of said stem 11 and the other laser light goes outside of said stem 13 .
