# A short total synthesis of dihydrothebainone, dihydrocodeinone, and nordihydrocodeinone.

## Abstract
A method of producing morphinan compounds which incorporates double advantages over the prior art, such as the utilization of beta , gamma unsaturated ketones in place of the alpha , beta unsaturated ketones previously used. Additionally, in the step where beta , gamma unsaturated bromoketones 13 or 14 proceed to 1 bromo N formylnordihydrothebainone morphinan 17 there are utilized super acids, such as trifluoromethane sulfonic, trifluoroethane sulfonic and mixtures thereof, and also antimony pentafluoride and mixtures of hydrogen fluoride and antimony pentafluoride. Super acids work, whereas the prior art shows that cyclization in the presence of acids, even strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric, do not work.

## Description
A Short Total Synthesis of Dihydrothebainone, Dihydrocodeinone, and Nordihydrocodeinone The present application relates to compounds which may be described as morphine agonists and antagonists. The synthesis utilized is capable of producing all of the medically important opium derivatives of the morphinan typei including thebaine. Among the advantages emphasized by the present invention are the utilization of ss, unsaturated ketones where in the past there have been used a, unsaturated ketones. Secondly, in the step below where unsaturated bromoketones 13 or 14 proceed to l bromo N formylnordihydrothebainone morphinan 17 , in this process there are utilized super acids, such as trifluoromethane sulfonic, trifluoroethane sulfonic and mixtures thereof, and alc antimony pentafluoride and mixtures of hydrogen fluoride and antimony pentafluoride.An additional advantage of the present process is that oxide bridge closure is accomplished in the N nor series bromonordihydrothebainone 18 nordihydrocodeinone 21 , thus affording ready access to either N nor or N methyl derivatives from the same intermediate 18. N nor derivatives are of paramount importance in the synthesis of narcotic antagonists and the agonist antagonist drugs. The N methyl derivative, dihydrocodeinone 22 , is a key intermediate. which can be converted by established methods to codeine, morphine, thebaine and all medically valuable opium derivatives of the morphinan type. In this specification, morphine type means alkaloid compounds generally of the morphinan structure.Specially interesting are morphine and morphinan agonist and antagonists. Grewe codeine method is a ring closure method utilizing bromine as a blocking group and deactivating influence on the phenolic ring cf. J. Het. Chem., June 1974, 363 . Birch reduction includes reduction with ammonia or lower amine and lithium preferred Or other alkali metal. The introduction of bromine in a 1 1 ratio followed by alkali metal base served to close the oxide bridge. In a process proceeding from bromonordihydrothebainone 18 the bridge head nitrogen may be apylated using an acid aldehyde, a lower aldehyde, or ketone such as theyl aldehyde or acetone.

With reference to the use of super acids, the invention encompasses such acids as trifluoromethane Sulf9nc, trifluoroethane sulfonic, etc., and, it is maintained that the use of these very strong acids overcomes the difficulty of use of acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric, etc. Relative to the compounds produced by alkylating the nitrogen bridge head, this reaction will work with lower amines and lower ketones. The utility of the products akin to nordihydrocodeinone 21 withN alkylate are morphine agonists or antagonists. These compounds with the N alkylate structure are denoted as tertiary amines and specially where N methyl, N ethyl, etc., are produced and the alkyl chain is C1 C6. Of the ketones, acetone and methyl ethyl ketone will operate.They are regarded as quite important for morphine overdose. In general, as to utility, dihydrothebainone 19 is noted in J. Med. Chem., 19 1171 1976 and dihydrocodeinone 22 is a prescription drug on the market at present produced by Mallinckrodt, etc., asHydrocodone. As a general summary of the above chart, the following general description in made commencing with codeine 1 . Racemic dihydrothebainone 19 , nordihydrocodeinone 21 and dihydrocodeinone 22 were synthesized in high overall yield from 3 methoxyphenethylamine 4 , via the key intermediate t 1 bromonor dihydrothebainone 18 the route utilized unprotected phenolic intermediates, involved directed Grewe type cyclization and for 21 and 22, exploited novel oxide bridge closure in the N nor series. Natural codeine l continues to occupy a position of central importance among the medically valuable derivatives of the opium poppy as the most frequently prescribed analgesic antitussive agent worldwide. Since the first total synthesis of codeine 1 and morphine 2 , other successful routes, including Grewe type and biomimetic approaches, have appeared. However, a practical total synthesis of these drugs has remained elusive. These and continuing efforts, together with possible shortages, underscore the desirability of securing a route which could render licit production of medical opiates independent of the natural and sole commercial source of these drugs.Since the reports that Grewe type electrophilic cyclization of l benzylhexahydroisoquinoline 9 afforded a 3 yield of the codeine precursor dihydrotheBainone 19 with isomeric 20 as the vastly predominant cyclization product , several groups have attempted to utilize this approach to codeine by introduction of a blocking substituent.at the l position of the benzyl moiety in order to direct cyclization to the desired dihydrothebainone oxygenation pattern. Studies utilizing a l methyl substituent were successful in this regard. However, such an approach must also employ a readily removable group to be of value in synthesis of codeine and congeners, of course, not the case in the l methyl.series. Substitution of bromine for methyl, unsuccessful hithertofore, would be ideal, since transformation of 4 hydroxymorphinans such as 19 to 22 with the oxide bridge closed as in codeine first involves bromination at C i of the morphinan system and later removal of the C l bromine atom by hydrogenolysis.Recent work describing conversion of dihydrothebainone l l9 to codeine 1 68 overall , via dihydrocodeinone, 22 and to C thebaine 3 , an important minor opium alkaloid in somewhat higher yield, renders any totally synthetic approach yielding l bromodihydrothebainone derivatives still more attractive. Such an approach which utilizes unprotected phenolic intermediates is short, experimentally simple, and affords dihydrothebainone 19 , nor dihydrocodeinone 21 and dihydrocodeinone 22 in high overall yield via the key intermediate l btomonordihydrothebainone 18 is included in this disclosure.The sequence rests essentially on high yield preparation of ss, gamma unsturated bromoketone 13, that is converted by directed Grewe type cyclization into i 1 bromo N formylnordihydrothebainone 17 , and on the novel oxide bridge closure in the N nor series, which optionally provides ready access to either Nmethyl or N nor derivatives. Heating a mixture of amine 4 and pure acid 5 at 2000C for 2 h under argon afforded amide 6 95 , EtOAc . Cyclization of 6 0.35 mol scale essentially as described for preparation of the 7 OH derivative of 7, generated an aqueous solution of the 1,2 dehydro derivative of 7. Neutralization to pH 4 5 with concentrated aqueous NH3 and reduction with an equimolar quantity of NaCNBH3 in ref fluxing 45 MeOH final concentration for 1.5 h afforded pure TLC 7 86 , mp 199.5 201.5 C. Birch reduction with lithium and ammonia of 85 mmol of unpurified 7 with 1.92 g atom of lithium in 450 ml of liquid NH3, 225 mL each of dry THF and t BuOH at 55 to 650C for 4 h, then at 750C until no 7 remained by TLC 9 1.5 h afforded 90 essentially pure TLC 8, mp 179.5 181.5 C.Refluxing unpurified 8 with 1. 5 equivalents of pure PhÇCHO in 10 volumes of EtOAc until homogeneous then 0.75 h until TLC showed absence of 8 gave 94 pure 10, mp 141 1430C Et2O PhOH which, like the N formyl derivatives described below and others, existed as two distinct rotomers, as shown by NMR. Stirring a solution of 10 25 C, 1 h in 20 volumes of dry THF containing 1 v v CH3SO3H and 3 molar equivalents of ethylene glycol generated a solution of ketal 11 quantitatively by TLC which was treated at 0 50C during 0.5 h with 1.05 equivalents of recrystallized N bromoacetamide NBA to afford essentially pure bromoketal 12 after neutralization with NH3 gas, solvent evaporation and workup with CHCl3 H2O.Bromoketal 12, mp 182.5 184 C, EtOA could be readily isolated in 88 yield but was most efficiently deketalized in 6 volumes of 5 1 88 HCO2H H2O 250C, 1 h followed by CHC13 aqueous NaHCO3 workup to afford 13, mp 203.5 206.50C DMF EtOAc , IR CHCl3 1717 C O and 1665 NCHO cm, 1 in 90 yield from 10. Bromoketone 13 underwent Grewe type cyclization to i l bromo N formylnordihydrothebainone 17 , mp 229.5 231.5 C CMF H2O in 60 isolated yield when treated in a screw capped, high density polyethylene bottle with 14 NH4FHF in dry CF3SO3H 0 C, under argon for 72 96 h until 13 had essentially disappeared by TLC . Also, isomerization of 13 occurred to give TLC the alpha ,ss. unsaturated bromoketone 16. Pure 16 afforded TLC only traces of morphinan 17 and ss, gamma unsaturated ketone 13 under the conditions used to cyclize 13 to 17. Treatment of pure morphinan 17 under these conditions gave no 13 or 16 TLC the acid catalyzed equilibrium of 13 and 16 lies nearly exclusively toward the side of the latter, which undergoes little, if any, morphinan cyclization under these conditions.Refluxing isolated 17 in 10 1 MeOH 378 aqueous HC1 for 18 h afforded 1 bromo nordihydrothebainone 18 , mp 220 2230C which was easily isolated in 92 yield by workup with NH H20 isopropanol. Dihydrothebainone 19 , mp 173 1750C, was obtained directly and quantitatively from 17 by hydrolysis as above, evaporation to dryness, and hydrogenation of the residue in 2N AcOH containing 50 mg 10 Pd C, 0.3 mL of 37 HCHO and 5 mmol of NaOAc per mmol of 17, followed by workup with CHC13 aqueous NH. Bromination 1.1 mol of Br2, 250C, 2h of an AcOH solution of the dry residue from hydrolysis of 17, evaporation, treatment of the residue with CHC1a lN NaOH and hydrogenation as above without addition ofHCHO afforded an 80 yield from 17 of i norelhydro codeinone 21 , that was readily isolated isopropanol, 1.1 equivalents of 37 aqueous HC1 as 21.HCl.0.5 H2O, mp 292 2950C dec anhydrous 21 base, mp 136.5 1380C PhCH3 . This is the first example of closure of the oxide bridge in the basic N nor series and is of potential interest in the synthesis of narcotic antagonists.When 17 was treated as in the preparation of 21, and 0.3 mL of 37 HCHO mmol of 17 was added to the hydrogenation medium dihydrocodeinone 22 , mp l58 1600C, was readily isolated as 22TsOH, mp 248 2510C in 79 yield from 17. This straightforward total synthesis of di hydrothebainone 19 , i nordihydrocodeinone 21 , and i dihydrocodeinone 22 in 37, 30 and 29 overall yields respectively, from readily available 3 methoxyphenethylamine 4 requires isolation of only 6 intermediates. These are directly obtained sufficiently pure for further transformation. In view of these results, the high yielding conversion of 19 to thebaine 3 and codeine 1 discussed above and the facile 0 demethylation of the latter to C morphine 2 , a practical total synthesis of these alkaloids and the thebaine based drugs has resulted. Resolution of racemic tetrahydroisoquinoline 7 is accomplished by formation and fractional crystallization of diasterisomeric salts with optically active acids such as tartaric, mandelic and tartranilic acid etc. The appropriate optically active base 7 is then regenerated and subjected the reaction sequence described herein to afford morphinan derivatives with the natural morphine absolute configuration.
