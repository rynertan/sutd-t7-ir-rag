# Apparatus for controlling idling rotation number of internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
Feedback control of the opening area of a bypass 31 which is provided in parallel with a throttle valve 32 of an en gine is conducted immediately after the cranking is completed, based on the deviation of existing RPM from the target RPM which is memorized as the function of the engine temperature in advance, to maintain the idling RPM of the engine at opti mum level in the state of after cranking without being affected by the possible change in viscosity of engine oil, the variations in temperatures of the ambient air and the engine cooling wa ter, the load of engine, and so on. The control signals for the feedback control are learnt when the existing RPM are sub stantially equal to the target RPM and stored in a memory. One of the learnt value is read out for fixing a control signal in the beginning of the state of after cranking so that the RPM of the engine is smoothly approximated to the target RPM when the engine shifts from the during cranking state to the idling state.
