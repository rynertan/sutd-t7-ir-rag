# Memory device incorporating an amorphous or microcrystalline alloy.

## Abstract
A memory device comprises an electrically conducting substrate having deposited thereon a layer of an amorphous or microcrystalline silicon carbon alloy and a layer of amorphous or microcrystalline silicon containing material to form a junction. Preferably the silicon containing material is silicon and the junction is a heterojunction. The device has fast switching characteristics and good stability.
