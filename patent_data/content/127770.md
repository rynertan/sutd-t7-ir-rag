# Feeder for revolving electrode.

## Abstract
A device for feeding an electric power to a roll like revolv ing electrode in an electrical resistance welding machine includes a feeder rotor 176 provided in a shaft 138 formed integrally with a revolving electrode 134 and a feeder plate 178 extending in the moving direction of the revolving elec trode 134 and disposed in contact with the periphery of the feeder rotor 176 . The periphery of the feeder rotor 176 is electrically coupled to the electrode surface of the revolving electrode 134 , and the feeder plate 178 is connected to a power supply 133 . Consequently, the electrode surface of the revolving electrode 134 is electrically coupled to the power supply 133 .
