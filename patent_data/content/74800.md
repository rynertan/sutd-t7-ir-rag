# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO MOULDING METHODS

## Abstract
In a method of moulding a ceramic core for use in the production of precision equipment separable die parts of resin are formed from a master model and resin oddsides are cast from the die parts. Further die parts formed from the oddsides are faced with nickel by electroforming and the faced die is then used for high speed injection moulding. Required slight changes in shape of the core can be obtained by altering the shape of the cast oddside and then casting new metal faced die parts.
