# Pressure sensitive adhesive block copolymer composion.

## Abstract
Pressure sensitive adhesive comprises, by weight 100 parts of a mixture of 2 block copolymers a at least 50 of A₁ B₁ A₂, where A₁, A₂ are monovinyl substituted aromatic blocks e.g. styrene, of average mol. wt 10,000 for A₂ and 5,000 for A₂, and B₁ is conjugated diene block, e.g. isoprene and b up to 50 of A₃ B₂ A₄ or A₅ B₃ n X where A₃, A₄, A₅ are each monovinyl substituted aromatic blocks of average mo. wt 8,000, B₂, B₃ each is a conjugated diene block, X is a coupling agent residue, e.g. silicon tetrahalide, n 2 6, and total of A₁ A₂ or A₃ A₄ or n A₅ each is not more than 50 of respective copolymer and 20 to 400 parts of a tackifier resign, e.g. a terpene resin. The composition in a solvent is coated on a polyester film to make an adhesive tape which is useful to seal corrugated board or carton boxes.
