# Particle detector.

## Abstract
A particle detector in which a pair of pipe means 1, 2 are coupled together through an aperture 4 and the liquid to be tested is passed through the pipe means 1, 2 and the aperture 4 with a voltage or current applied to the liquid through the pipe means 1, 2 acting as electrodes so that the diameter of the pipe means 1, 2 is reduced because the electrodes are not provided in the pipe means 1, 2 .
