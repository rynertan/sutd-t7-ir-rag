# Continuous smoothing machine with conveying tape for solid surfaces, particularly adapted for slabs of stony material.

## Abstract
It is a continuous smoothing machine, which has a device able to allow the abrasive or finishing plates 4 to go through a path inclined of a 90 DEG alpha angle during the going run and of a 270 DEG alpha angle during the return run, with respect to the longitudinal axis of a conveying tape with continuous motion for the slab 1 to be worked, alpha being a prefixed angle chosen in such a way as to allow a plate working path substantially perpendicular to the direction of advancement of the tape.

## Description
Continuous smoothing machine with conveying tape for solid surfaces, particularly adapted for slabs of stony material . The present invention relates to a machine for roughing, smoothing and finishi.ng solid surfaces, particularJ.y adapted for stony materials. As known, roughing or gauger ing, smoothing and finishing are the last stages of working of stony materials and are carried out by means of horizontal circular plates driven to rotary mo t jori and provided with abrading or finishing materials of several kinds on the lower faces. About twelve years ago, there appeared on the market the tape type Smoothing machines, also called continuous lines , in which abrading and finishing plates simultaneously driven to rotary motion and to alternating transi atory motion perpendicular to th continuous motion of the tape act simultaneously on horizontal slabs. Due to their rate of product ion, these machines have had a wide and deserved diffusion and, even if different from each other in the several models, have basically won the market of the stony industry. We now analyze the opertion of any known abrasive plate, by considering Fig. 1, wherein we have designated with VN the speed wector of the tape, caused to advance in the direction of its longitudinal axis, and therefore of the superimposed slab, witty I tlht moving slab having width L, with 2 a stationary trans versal br idge wlicIi rests on bases 3 and further represents the pat It ,f tilt plate 4 with speed vector VM In Fig. 2 we have indicated by hatching the slab zone already worked by the plate 4, which, having ended the going run A B, is going to start again for the return run B C.The virgin area worked by the plate during any run, VN, VM and L remaining constant, will be an isosceles triangle with height L, base A C 2 tang alpha .L and vertex angle 2 alpha , caused by the vectorial composition of VN and VM it is obtainedEMI2.1 This fact will appear clearer if we imagine the tape stations ry and the transversal bridge i.n motion towards the top part of the drawing.The work of the plate during its running of the length B C with its higher edge and at speed VM will be constitu ted by removal of a given thickness of material with a width which varies from 0 at point B to a maximum value i max A C 2 tang .L Its average value will therefore be equal to max 2 and, since the tape speed V and consequently alpha and consequently max have been chosen in such a way that the tool resists the maximum, even if mooentaneous, stress at the end of each run, we should conclude that we exploit a half part of the possibilities of the plate. We add that in these conditions of employment we can never have a constant optimal pressure due to the continuous change of the new surface to be worked and, similarly, we can never have a constant. optimal amount of cooling and washing water, due to tht continuous change of the volume of removed material. The object of the present invention is to realize a machine which adds to the favourable features of the present smoothing machines of tape type that of exploiting almost the 100 of the maximum capacity of the tool. According to the invention such an object is reached by a tape type smoothing machine, of which we have schematically indi cated in Fig. 3 one of the several abrasive groups of the same smoothing machine, which group differs from that of Fig. 1 as to the fact that the transversal bridge 2 rests on semicircular guides 3, which allow it to rotate through a same angle 4 both .in clockwise and anticlockwise sense. In Figs. 4 to 7 there are indicated the successive positions of the horizontal plate 4 and of the transversal bridge 2 with its inclination g with respect to the motion of the conveying tape, that is of the slab 1. As already said, the representation is limited to one abrasive group, even .if their number in a smoothing machine really varies from 4 to 13. In Fig. 3 the plate 4 .is in starting position with the bridge 2 inclined of A As รก has been calculated previously according to the speed VN of the conveying tape and the translation speed VM of the plate 4 is also known, at the end of the going run the plate see Fig. 4 will have worked a horizontal strip which has been indicated by right hand inclined hatching. In Fig. 5 the bridge is shown in continuous line before the 2 1 anticlockwise rotation and then in dashed line .in the posi tioti suitable to alLow the plate to start the return run. At the end of the return run the plate see Fig. 6 will have worked a horizonta1 strip which has been indicated by left hand inclined hatching. Fig. 7 .is merely the repetition,however with clockwise rota tiun, of the movement illustrated in Fig. 5 for putting the plate in the starting position of Fig. 3 and therefore repeating the operating cycle. It should be noted that the anti clockwise and clockwise rota tions of the bridge 2 as shown in Figs. 5 and 7 allow the plate 4 to work perfectly the lateral edges of the slab 1. We know the maximum length gmax, equal to A C of Fig. 2, the slab width L and the plate speed VM From Fig. 5 we see that, due to the rotation of the bridge, the plate i.s moved upwards of tang alpha . L. and, having put slightly shorter than max for the reasons which will be explained later, we can obtain tang and and subsequently 1 and sin alpha By adjusting the tape speed at the value VN sin 4 . VM we will be sure to have a resultant VN VM perpendicular to V as it was our intention.The fact that has been put shorter than max in the calculation depends on the advancement of the tape during the time tR employed for the rotation, multiplied by the total width of the strip will. therefore be tang alpha .L tR VN which we will obviously find, through simple calculations, substantially equal to a max, as it was our intention if the total lcngt,h is very different from max, we will find . max tang LA. L tR. VN We omit to describe the several automatisms already used for adjusting the work width, the lowering or rising of the plates, the tape speed and so on, which are widely known. Practical calculations on slabs as wide as 1.60 ms have shown that, against a tape speed of 45,7 cms min of a conventional smoothing machine, a machine according to the invention allows to obtain with alpha 4.61 an almost double speed. This justifies the expenses for the construction of the semicurcular guides and the control for the rotation of the transversa1 bridges at each end of run.
