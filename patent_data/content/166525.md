# METHOD OF PIXEL TO VECTOR CONVERSION IN AN AUTOMATIC PICTURE CODING SYSTEM

## Abstract
An automatic picture coding system including a method for converting a bit map image of the picture to vectors as the picture is being scanned. The bit map is delayed as it is being generated to form a series of tessellations or windows of data. The windows are propagated through a series of neighbor hood logic elements which perform data transformation opera tions such as growing, smoothing and thinning of the bit map image. A bit stream output from the neighborhood logic which output includes only line and edge features of the original pic ture is transferred serially to a microcomputer where the fea tures are partitioned into a plurality of line segments. Each line segment is chain coded and temporarily stored, as it is ac quired, in a corresponding one of a plurality of lists, the lists be ing linked in an order corresponding with the order in which the segments are acquired. When the storage of each chain coded segment is completed, the segment is converted to vectors and transmitted to a user device for display, storage, or further processing, the lists in which the converted segments were stored being unlinked and deallocated. The process is con tinued until the entire document has been scanned and con verted to vectorial data.
