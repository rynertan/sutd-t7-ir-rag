# Articulated waist terrain vehicle.

## Abstract
In waist articulated terrain vehicles, especially forest machines, with a wheeled forward section 1 , a rear section 5 and a driver s cab 11 , driver comfort can be substantially increased by the cab 11 being so mounted on the vehicle that it is substantially unaffected by the tilting movements of the forward section about an axis in the travelling direction thereof, simultane ously as it is adapted for accompanying the forward section in its steering movements.
