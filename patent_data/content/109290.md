# DEWATERING SYSTEM WITH ADJUSTABLE WIDTH SUCTION SLOT

## Abstract
A suction dewatering system for a paper making machine has a suction device 10 with an opening 12 extending long tudinally in a direction transverse to the path P of material travel through the machine. Elongated wear strips 20a, 20b are supported on opposite sides of the opening 12 to define a suction slot 22 therebetween. A guide channel 26 extends longitudinally through at least one of the wear strips 20a, 20b in a direction parallel to the suction slot 22 . An adjusting plate 3 is shiftable longitudinally within the or each guide channel 26 . Oblique cam slots 40 in the or each adjusting plate 38 coact with fixed guide members 34 to laterally adjust the po sition of the one wear strip 20a or 20b relative to the other wear strip 20b or 20a thereby to vary the width of the suction slot.
