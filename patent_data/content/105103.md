# Microstrip antenna system having nonconductively coupled feedline.

## Abstract
A microcrisp antenna system having one or more con ductively isolated resonantly dimensioned radiator struc tures disposed less than about one tenth wavelength above a ground plane is nonconductively coupled to an inter mediate layer of microcrip feedline structure. The micro strip feedline structure includes various microstrip trans mission line segments fed with reference to the ground plane and including predetermined coupling locations posi tioned an odd integer number of one fourth wavelength s from an effective r.f. short circuit to the underlying ground plane. Such coupling locations are also disposed proximate a predetermined corresponding feedpoint region of the ra diating structure such that electromagnetic fields con centrated at the coupling location operate to nonconductive ly couple r.f. energy to from the radiator structure from to the feedline structure. The coupling location is preferably disposed at a widened and relatively lowered r.f. impedance coupling tab segment of the transmission line having a width dimension which is sufficient to provide matched im pedance coupling to the corresponding feedpoint region but which is also substantially less than the dimension of the radiator structure transverse to its resonant dimension. The effective r.f. short circuit may be provided by an actual conductive connection to the underlying reference surface or by an r.f. open circuit termination located an additional one fourth wavelength therefrom along the feedline struc ture.
