# Double walled fluid pressure line.

## Abstract
A fuel supply system has a fuel source 12, 16 and a double walled fluid line 18 for use, for example, in a fuel injection system. The fuel line 18 has inner 30 and outer 70 nominally concentric tubes having an annular space therebetween. The inner tube 30 receives fuel from the source 12, 16 and the outer tube 70 is connected back to the source 12, 16 to return venting leaking fluid to the source 12, 16 .
