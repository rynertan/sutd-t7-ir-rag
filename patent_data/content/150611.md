# Vehicle Immobilisation device.

## Abstract
A vehicle immobilisation device comprises a pair of chocks 1 and 2 for abutting a vehicle wheel on either side in a direction of rotation of its ground contact point, a top hook 7 for hooking over the wheel at a point over the ground contact point, a chock arm 3,4 secured to each chock, the chock arms being relatively movable to adjust the separation of the chocks, and an adjustable length stem 5 for connecting the top hook to the chock arms and including a lock 6 to lock the stem and chock arms together with the chocks and top hook in position to captivate the vehicle wheel. The chock arms 3 and 4 include oppositely facing channels 9 and 10 with complementary corrugated strips 41 and 42 which are interengageable to prevent relative movement of the chock arms at one of a plurality of positions in which the stem can be locked to the chock arms, by movement normal to the direction of chock separation adjustment. The stem 5 has a foot channel 44 opening downwardly which is engageable over the interengaged channels 9 and 10 to prevent relative movement of the corrugated strips normal to the direction of chock separation adjustment.
