Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with mitogens or allogeneic cells in MLC Human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes MNC from 6 normal donors were adjusted at a concentration 2 x 10 cells ml and were cultured with optimal concentrations of Con A or PHA or SEA PHA 5 10 micrograms ml, Con A 2 25 Micrograms ml and 0.01 0.1 micrograms ml ofSEA .The cells were cultured for 2 4 days, then washed three times with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 heat inactivated fetal calf serum FCS and fused with lymphoblastoid T cell lines as described.Alternatively, E Rosette forming cells were isolated from mitogen stimulated MLC by rosetting with sheep erythocytes by the method described below.In other experiments human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes at a concentration of approximately 2 x 106 cells ml were stimulated with allogeneic mononuclear 6 cells as for example 2 x 10 cells ml irradiated at 2500 rads. Cells were washed 3x with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 heat inactivated FCS and fuesd with lymphoblastoid T cell lines as described.Human lymphoblastoid T cell line Cells of the Jurkat T cell line were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mM Hepes buffer, 2 mM L glutamine, 100U ml penicillin and 100 micrograms ml of streptomycin. Fjusio Hybrid Cell Production Human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes or purified T cells stimulated with mitogens or allogeneic cells in MLC were washed 3 x with serum free RPMI 1640. Cells from the Jurkat lymphoblastoid T cell line or other cell lines employed were so washed.Mitogen or alloantigen activated mononuclear cells or Tlymphocytes were mixed in a single tube with cells from a T cell line such as a lymphoblastoid T cell line asJurkat at appropriate rations such as 10 1. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 400 xg. The supernatant was removed and discarded and the mixed cell pellet was disrupted and dispersed by gentle agitation. o 1 ml of pre warmed 37 C fusion medium 50 polyethylene glycol in RPMI 1640 was added dropwise to the cell pellet and the mixture was agitated by rocking the tube gently by hand for one minute moving the tube 0 through an arc of a circle of about 90 is found to work 0 well . 1 ml of pre warmed 37 C serum free RPMI 1640 was added slowly and the tube was rolled gently between the hands for about one minute.Two ml of pre warmed serum free RPMI 1640 was added and the tube was rolled gently between the hands for about two minutes.Four ml of prewarmed RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 heat inactivated FCS were added and the tube was rolled between the hands for about three minutes.Eight ml of prewarmed RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 heat inactivated FCS and the tube was gently rolled between the hands for another three minutes.The cells were centrifuged for ten minutes at 400 g, and re suspended very gently in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15 20 heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mMHepes, 2mM L glutamine, 100 U ml penicillin, 100 micrograms ml streptomycin. 0The cells were incubated at 37 c in a humidified incu bator with 5 CO 2Selection procedureAfter incubation for appropriate time intervals 1 60 0 days at 37 C the cells were twice washed with RPMI 1640 suppled with 10 z heat inactivated fetal calf serum FCS , and appropriate number of cells in this medium were mixed with appropriate volumes of semi solid medium such as 1 agar in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15 heat inactivation FCS, 2n0I L glutamine, 25 mM Hepes 100U ml penicillin, 100 micrograms ml streptomycin to achieve a final concentration of about 0.3 agar. The cells and the agar were mixed immediately and the cells werde transferred quickly to appropriate sized petri dishes such as 100 mm.Other semi solid media may be used as well as agar. iT had been standard procedure in the art of hybrodoma selection to incubate cells for two days and then transfer them to HAT medium. In this invention such a medium or any other toxic medium is not used . In this invention the best times for transfer to semi solid medium after incubation were found to be 10, 15 and 20 days. Other sufficient incubation times might be 5 days or 3 days etc. for example.The agar was let solidify at room temperature and the o petri dishes were transferred to a humidified 37 C incubator with 5 CO . Growth of colonies was revealed 2 by macro or microscopic inspection at 7 40 days.Individual colonies were transferred to 96 well flatbottomed well plates and 100 microliters of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 heat inactivated FCS, 25 mMHepes, 2 mM L glutamine, 100 U ml penicillin, 100 microgram ml streptomycin was added per well.In certain experiments these wells contained feeder cultures consisting of irradiated with 2500 rads human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes, whose lymphocytes were used as a fusion partner or possibly from other donors.Supernatants or hybrids from wells exhibiting cell growth were expanded and screened for functional properties using the methods described below.Hybrids with functional properties were HLA typed an cytogenetically analyzed. Alternatively, one could screen first by HLA or T cell differentiation antigen expression and then determine functional properties of hybrids so selected. Cells producing factors useful for biotherapy or exhibiting specific biological functions of interest were further re cloned several times by limiting dilution methods at the level of 0.2 0.4 cells well in RPMI 1640 containing 15 20 heatinactivated FCS, 25 mM Hepes, 2mM L glutamine, 100 U ml penicillin, 100 micrograms ml streptomycin.Feeder layers were employed comprising approximately 25,000 100,000 irradiated human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes preferably from the same donor used as a fusion partner or from a different donor.

Rabbit anti human immunoglobulin antibody, heavy chain specific mu, gamma or alpha Accurate Chemical were arranged at a concentration of 5 g ml in 0.10 M Na2CO3, pH 9.6, containing 0.05 sodium azide. Two hundred microliters of antibody solution per well were transferred into 96 well round bottom 0 microliter plates and incubated at 37 C for 3 hours. 0 The plates were stored at 4 C until use and were stable for over two weeks. Before use the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.02 Tween 20 three times, were allowed to remain at room temperature for 5 min, between washings. Several dilutions of the unknown immunoglobulin containing supernatants were prepared in PBS containing 0.02 Tween 20 and volumes of 0.2 ml will be transferred to the plates.The plates were incubated for 5 hours at room temperature, on a rocket platform. Supernatants were removed by aspiration and the tubes were washed three times with PBS, containing 0.02 Tween 20.
