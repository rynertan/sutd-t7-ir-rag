# A method and a system for detecting a leakage in a conduit system.

## Abstract
Leakage in a conduit system 10, 12 is detected by means of a fluid flow detector 14 and evaluated by means of a control device 15 on the basis of predetermined criteria. When the control device, which may include a microcomputer 42 has received a signal from the flow detector 14 indicating that fluid is flowing through the conduit system the control device operates an alarm device 19 and or closes the fluid supply by means of a valve 11 , if the fluid flow is considered to be caused by a leak or break in the conduit system evaluated on the basis of the time at which the flow takes place, the duration of the detected flow, the intensity of the detected flow, and or information about whether the fluid drains 13 of the conduit system are closed. The conduit system 10, 12 may, for example, be a conduit system for supply of water or gas to apartment houses and one family houses, but may also form parts of industrial plants. The above mentioned method makes it possible to obtain a quick detection of leaks in hidden as well as unexposed conduits or tubes without the presence of persons being necessary, whereby the risk of damages due to leaks may be substantially reduced.
