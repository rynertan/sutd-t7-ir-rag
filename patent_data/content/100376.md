# METAL WORKING TOOL

## Abstract
A metal working tool 10 comprising a seat 12, a bimetallic metal cutting insert 14 , and a chipbreaker 16. High strength structural component 66 of insert 14 has at least one metal cutting edge 56 while inner structural component 68 has high thermal conductivity for conducting heat away from cutting region 55. A novel internal fluid system directs a plurality of coolant fluid streams proximate working region 55, Simultaneous use of an electrical through the tool hot machining technique and the internal fluid system of the bimetallic tool provides enhanced machinability of a work piece and decreased tool wear.
