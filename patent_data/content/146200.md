# Multi position relief valve.

## Abstract
A multi position pressure relief valve 10 settable to operate at different pressure limits includes an adjustment rod 40 , a valve bias spring 26 and a valve member 20 extending coaxially with one another, the axial spacing be tween the rod and the valve member determining the pres sure limit for the valve. The rod carries a pin 44 adapted to engage a stepped surface 37a 37e of a limit select mem ber 31 , the steps defining a plurality of stop positions for the rod, and each stop position corresponding to a different pressure limit setting. A control knob 34 attached to the rod enables the rod to be manipulated to locate the pin in the stop position corresponding to the pressure limit desired.
