## Description
FLAME RETARDS NUT POLYPHENYLENE ETHER STYRENE ThERMO PLASTIC RESIN COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to thermoplastic polyphenyl.ene ether styrene polymers which are rendered flame retardant by having incorporated therewith effective amounts of a triaryl phosphate and a 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide. The polyphenylene ethers are known and described in numerous publications including U.S. Patent Nos.3,306,874 and 3,306,875 of Allan S. Hay and U.S. PatentNos. 3,257,357 and 3,257,358 of Gelu Stoeff Stamatoff.The high molecular weight polymers are high performance engineering thermoplastics possessing relatively high melt viscosities and softening points that is, in excess of 2750C, and are useful for many conercial applications requiring high temperature resistance including formation of file, fiber and molded articles. The combination of polyphenylene oxide ethers with polystyrene and modified polystyrene is also known and described in U.S. Patent No. 3,385,435. The preferred polystyrenes are the high impact polystyrenes such as the styrene acrylonitrile copolymers and styrene acrylonitrile butadiene copolymers. Such compositions are referred to in this specification and in the claims as polyphenylene ether styrene resin compositions1. Other polyphenylene ether resin compositions that find wide use as an engineering thermoplastic are the graft copolymer compositions containing 30 to 90 weight percent of a graft copolymer of polyphenylene ether with a styrene type compound and 10 to 70 weight percent of a styrene type compound polymer having a number average molecular weight in the range of 50i000 to 200,000. Graft copolymers that are free from polyphenylene ether homopolymers may be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,929,930 by polymerizing 20 to 200 parts by weight of a styrene type com pound at a temperature in the range of from 1300C to 2000C in the presence of 100 parts by weight of a polyphenylene ether and 0.1 to 15 parts by weight of a radical initiator.The number average polymerization degree of the polyphenylene ether used is in the range from 50 to 300, preferably from 60 to 280 and more preferably from 70 to 250. Such graft copolymers are known for their excellent moldability and are high performance engineering thermoplastics. Said graft copolymers are useful in many commercial applications requiring high temperature resistance including formation of film, fiber and molded articles. The combination of 1 such graft copolymers of polyphenylene oxide ethers with 2 styrene type compound polymers is also known and described in U.S.Patent No. 3,929,931. The preferred polystyrenes are the high impact polystyrenes such as the styrene acrylonitrile copolymer 5 and styrene acrylonitrile butadiene copolymers. In general, compositions containing from 30 to 90 percent by weight of the polyphenylene oxide graft copolymer and from 10 to 70 percent by weight of a styrene type compound polymer having a number average molecular weight in the range from 50,000 to 200,000 exhibit the best overall combination of properties and these compositions are preferred. These compositions are also referred to in this specification and in the claims as polyphenylene ether styrene resin compositions . Such polyphenylene oxide graft copolymer styrene compositions may also be rendered flame retardant by having incorporated therewith effective amounts of a triaryl phosphate and a 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide. With the current and future federal requirements obligating automotive manufacturers to improve the efficiency of their product and reduce fuel consump tion, there is a substantial growth in the use of engineering plastics as a replacement for metal to achieve weight reduction. The use of polyphenylene ether styrene compositions in the transportation, electrical electronic and appliance categories accounts for a majority of its volume, and polyphenylene ether styrene compositions are the dominant engineering thermoplastic in appliance use. Such compositions are in general, characterized as being relatively stable thermally upon long exposure to processing temperatures and shear. Upon exposure to flame, however, they burn quite readily as would be anticipated from their relative high styrene content. There is a substantial and increasing demand for flame retardant polyphenylene ether styrene resin compositions. To improve flame retardant characteristics, polyphenylene ether styrene resin compositions have been compounded with flame retardant additives, that is, aromatic halogen compounds plus aromatic phosphates as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,639,506. A preferred composition in accordance with that teaching comprises from 20 to 80 by weight of poly 2,6 dimethyl l,4 phenylene ether, 20 to 80 by weight of a high impact polystyrene styrene modified with rubber and from 3 to 25 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polyphenylene ether styrene composition of a flame retardant combination of 1 part triphenyl phosphate and 3 to 4 parts of a heavily chlorinated biphenyl.U.S. Patent No. 4,154,775 states that cyclic phosphates are, by themselves, an effective, non plasticizing flame retardant additive for polyphenylene oxide compositions. Such additives, however, frequently degrade or cause degradation under processing conditions extrusion at about 2509C resulting in poor mechanical performance of the thermoplastic polyphenylene oxide compositions themselves. One problem is that the heat distortion temperature of the polyphenylene ether sty rene resin composition is lowered by a flame retardant. The known flame retardants for polyphenylene ether styrene compositions suffer generally from one or more deficiencies including low compatibility, low thermal stability, also low heat distortion temperature and or poor fire retardant behavior in molded polyphenylene oxide styrene resin compositions. Additionally, a serious problem posed by aromatic halogen flame retardants in polyphenylene oxide compositions is attributable to acid formation, either due to or arising from light exposure or thermal degradation with the released acid then attacking metal components in enduse applications. Some aromatic halogen compounds are contraindicated as fire retardant additives due to toxicity problems of the compound, that is, muta genicity. The present invention provides compositions containing a triaryl phosphate and a 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide having the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 may be the same or a different radical sel ected from the group consisting of hydrogen and the methyl radicals, R2 is an alkyl radical of 4 to 8 carbon atoms and n is either zero or one which is an excellent flame retardant and when present in polyphenylene ether styrene resin composition in effective amounts affords the advantage of resistance to burning and improved melt viscosity without appreciably lower i g the heat distortion temperature of the resin. The addition of the aryl phosphate and 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide to the polyphenylene ether styrene composition in the amount required to improve flame retardant properties does not adversely modify the phvsical properties of the polyphenylene oxide composition to a point where its commercial use is impaired. The blend of 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide and triaryl phosphate is readily compatible with the polyphenylene ether styrene resin compositions and effective when added in small quantities, that is, from about 3 to about 6 parts per hundred of triaryl phosphate and from about 2 1 2 to about 5 parts per hundred of phosphine oxide.Particularly preferred compositions are flame retardant polyphenylene etherstyrene compositions to which have been added from about 4 to about 5 parts per hundred of triaryl phosphate and about 3 to about 4 parts per hundred of a 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide. In accordance with the present invention, a polyphenylene ether styrene resin composition containing about 30 weight percent of a polyphenylene ether and about 70 weight percent of a polystyrene is rendered flame retardant by having incorporated with about 100 parts thereof from about 3 to about 6 parts by weight of a triaryl phosphate and from about 2 1 2 to about 5 parts by weight of a 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide having the formula EMI5.1 wherein R1 may be the same or a different radical selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and the methyl radicals, R2 is a radical of 4 to 8 carbon atoms and n is either zero or one. The resulting polyphenylene ether styrene composition has a UL 94 rating of V l or better, a heat distortion temperature greater than about 870C and a melt viscosity at 2600C less than about 2,000 poise.The UL 94 rating when referred to throughout the specification and claims is determined on a specimen 1.588 mm 1 16 thick. The flame resistant polyphenylene ether styrene compositions having incorporated therein the aryl phosphate and 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide in accordance with the present invention are particularly advantageous for use in appliances, business machines, terminal strips connectors and blocks. The merits that may be attributed to the aryl phosphate and 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide mixture relative to conventional flame retardant agents in present use include no corrosion, non toxicity and minimal adverse change in the physical properties of the polymer. The heat distortion temperature of the polyphenylene ether styrene composition is not appreciably affected by the addition thereto of 3 6 parts per hundred of a triaryl phosphate and 2 1 2 to 5 parts per hundred of a phosphine oxide flame retardant.Particularly advantageous in combination with a triaryl phosphate are the alkyl bis 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides such as butyl bis 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide which is compatible with polyphenylene etherpolystyrene resins and has improved mixing parameters that reduce polymer degradation by lowering the processing temperature lower melt viscosity . Also useful as flame retardant additives are mixtures of a triaryl phosphate with the tris 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides such as tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide, tris 2 methyl 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide and mixtures of the same. 3 Hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxides may be prepared by first reacting a 3 hydroxy l,2 unsaturated oleo in such as allyl alcohol with phosphine in the presence of a free radical catalyst as described in U.S. PatentNo. 3,489,811. The use of stoichiometric quantities of reactants or as little as 48 excess alcohol reduces the formation of higher molecular weight by products. The 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine obtained by this process is readily converted to the corresponding phosphine oxide by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide. An example of phosphine oxide useful with a triaryl phosphate as fire retardant additives in polyphenylene ether styrene compositions is the tris 3hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide, derived from allyl alcohol. Tris 3 hydroxy 2 methylpropyl phosphine oxide, derived from methallyl alcohol may also be used as a fire retardant additive but is more volatile. Phosphine oxides having different 3 hydroxyalkyl groups on the phosphorus atom such as EMI7.1 wherein n is either 1 or 2, may be prepared by reacting phosphine with a mixture of allyl and methallyl alcohol and oxidizing the resulting product. Such mixed phosphine oxides are more volatile than the tris 3 hydrosy propyl phosphine oxide. The relative volatility of this series of compounds rate of vaporization by ther mogravimetr ic technique in order of increasing volatility is tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide, bis 3hydroxypropyl 2 methyl 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide, tris 2 methyl 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide and 3 hydroxypropyl bis 2 methyl 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide.These mixed phosphine oxides as well as physical mixtures of such mixed phosphine oxides with tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide and or tris 2methyl 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide are useful additives in combination with a triaryl phosphate in preparing flame retardant polyphenylene ether styrene resin compositions. The triaryl phosphate that is incorporated with the 3 hydroxyalkyl phosphine oxide in the polyphenylene oxide styrene composition of the present invention may be a triaryl phosphate such as mesityl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, trixylenyl phosphate, or cresyl diphenyl phosphate. It is preferred, however, that the triaryl phosphate be a mixed isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate mixed ester composition prepared by the method described in U.S. Patent No. 3,576,923 from a synthetic alkylate. The molecular weight of the triaryl phosphate may vary from about 340 cresyl diphenyl phosphate to about 390. When an isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate is present in the composition, the ratio of the moles of isopropyl radicals to phosphorus atoms present in the triaryl phosphate is between about 1 1 and about 1.5 1. The following examples will more fully illustrate the invention. EXAMPLE I Preparation of Tris 3 Bydroxypropyl Phosphine Oxide Into a one liter pressure reactor is placed 307 g 5.3 moles allyl alcohol and 20 ml of a solution containing 3 g azobisisobutyronitrile dissolved in 100 ml of allyl alcohol. The pressure reactor is closed and charged with 36 g 1.06 moles of phosphine. The reaction mixture is agitated by rocking the reactor for two hours at 800C. The reaction mixture is permitted to cool to room temperature and the pressure vessel is vented in a hood to release any unreacted phosphine. An additional 20 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution described above is added to the reactor which is closed and the system is again heated to 800C and rocked for one hour. The addition of 20 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution is repeated with intermediate agitation at 800C for one hour under pressure until all of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution 100 ml has been added. The contents of the reactor are then heated to 800C under pressure and rocked for an additional five hours. The yellow solution that results from the above reaction is vacuum distilled by heating to about 850C 133 Pa 1 mm Hg and maintaining at that temperature and pressure for about four hours to remove volatiles lmono , and bis 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine and unreacted allyl alcohol. The residue remaining in the distillation pot is a clear yellow syrup weighing 184 g. This non volatile yellow syrup is dissolved in an equal volume of a 50 50 mixture of isopropanol methanol and oxidized by stirring with the dropwise addition of a 30 aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution diluted with an equal volume of isopropanol. When the exothermic reaction subsides, the solution of phosphine oxide is tested by adding one drop of the solution to 1 ml of carbon disulfide until no red coloration can be detected visually in the carbon disulfide layer.This indicates complete oxidation of the phosphine to tris 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide. Following oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, the solvents water, isopropanol and methanol are removed from the reaction product by heating to 650C under vacuum. The viscous yellow slush which remains is filtered through a Buchner Funnel to collect 42.4 grams of a white solid that is insoluble in isopropanol at room temperature. The yield, based on the phosphine used is 17.8 . After washing with isopropanol and air drying, the white solid analyses for tris 3 hy droxypropyl phosphine oxide. Found Theory C 48.29 C 48.21 H 9.28 H 9.38 P 13.3 P 13.848 In a similar manner, 2 methyl 3 hydroxypropyl bis 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide may be prepared by reacting one mole of methallyl alcohol and two moles of allyl alcohol with phosphine and oxidizing with hydrogen peroxide. Four pph of this compound and 4 pph of a triaryl phosphate when incorporated with a polyphenylene oxide styrene thermoplastic resin composition containing 30 weight percent polyphenylene ether and 70 weight percent high impact polystyrene results in a UL 94 rating of V 1, a heat distortion temperature greater than 870C and a melt viscosity at 2600C less than 2,000 poise. EXAMPLE II n Butyl bi S 3 Hydroxypropyl Phosphine Oxide Into a four liter stainless steel pressure reactor is placed 0.5 g azobisisobutyronitrile dissolved in 600 ml of toluene. The reactor is purged with nitrogen and charged with 112 g 2.0 moles of butene and 102 g 3.0 moles, 50 excess phosphine. The reaction mixture is heated and stirred at 850C 900C for one hour and maintained at that temperature with stirring while five 20 ml portions of azobisisobutyronitrile solution 5.5 g in 350 ml of toluene are added at 20 minute intervals over 1 hour 40 minutes. No exotherm is noted during the catalyst addition and the pressure reading dropped from 1.432 MPa 190 psig at the time of the first 20 ml catalyst addition to 1.397 MPa 185 psig 20 minutes after the last catalyst addition . The excess phosphine is vented from the reaction vessel and 278 g 4.8 moles, 208 excess of allyl alcohol and 40 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile catalyst solution is added to the reaction vessel. No exotherm is observed and heating is continued at 850C 900C with stirring and addition of 20 ml of azobisisobutyronitrile every 20 minutes until all of the catalyst solution 350 ml has been added. The temperature is maintained with stirring at 850C 900C for 11 hours. A clear yellow liquid is removed from the reactor and heated to 1100C 133 Pa 1 mm Hg to distill off the volatile materials. The residue is a clear yellow liquid weighing 290.9 grams.This residue is dissolved in an equal volume of isopropanol and oxidized with 308 hydrogen peroxide dissolved in an equal volume of isopropanol as described above in Example I to give 308.2 g of a viscous yellow liquid after removal of water and isopropanol containing a small amount of a white suspended solid The mixture is diluted with chloroform, filtered to remove the white solid, and the chloroform is evaporated to give a clear yellow liquid.The analyses of this liquid product is Found Calculated for n butyl bis 3 hydroxypropyl phosphine oxide C 54.50, 54.40 54.05 H 10.21, 10.21 10.36 P 13.28, 13.65 13.96 Three pph of this compound and 5 ppb of a triaryl phosphate when incorporated with a polyphenylene oxidestyrene resin composition containing 30 weight percent polyphenylene ether and 70 weight percent high impact polystyrene results in a UL 94 rating of V 1, a heat distortion temperature greater than 870C and a melt viscosity at 2600C less than 2,000 poise. EXAMPLE III Preparation of Tris 3 Hydroxy 2 Methylpropyl Phosphine Oxide Tris 3 hydroxy 2 methylpropyl phosphine is prepared by the method described in Example I above. Into a four liter pressure reactor equipped with a stirrer and thermometer is placed 690 g 9.6 moles of methallyl alcohol and 40 ml of a solution containing 9 g azobisisobutyronitrile dissolved in 200 ml of toluene. The pressure reactor is closed and charged with 96 g 2.8 moles of phosphine. The reaction mixture is heated with stirring to 600C at which temperature the reaction becomes exothermic and the temperature rises to 107 C. Stirring is continued as the temperature subsides from 1070C to 900C and the pressure drops from 803.2 KPa to 349 KPa 100 psig to 50 psig . The temperature is maintained at 900C with heating and stirring for one hour at which time 50 ml of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution in toluene is pumped into the reactor.The reaction mixture is maintained at 900C for one hour with stirring after the second addition of catalyst. The addition of 50 ml of the azo bisisobutyronitrile solution is repeated with continuous stirring at 900C each hour until all of the azobisisobutyronitrile solution 200 ml has been added.The contents of the reactor are then stirred while maintaining the temperature at 900C for an additional four hours. After the last addition of catalyst solution, the pressure in the reaction vessel has dropped to atmosphere pressure. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, removed from the reaction vessel and heated up to 350C at 266.6 Pa 2 mm Hg to distill off the volatile components toluene, methallyl alcohol, monoand bis addition products . The non volatile colorless liquid residue tris 3 hydroxy 2 methylpropyl phosphine weighs 614.7 g.It is dissolved in an equal volume of isopropanol and chilled on ice. The phosphine present in solution is oxidized by the dropwise addition with stirring of a 30 aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution diluted with an equal volume of isopropanol. Inasmuch as the oxidation reaction is exothermic, the course of the reaction may be followed by the temperature increase upon addition of hydrogen peroxide. When the exotherm subsides, a small aliquot of the reaction mixture is tested after each addition of hydrogen peroxide with hydrogen peroxide test paper and by addition of a few drops of the reaction mixture to 1 ml of carbon disulfide. At the end of the oxidation reaction, the observed red color of the carbon disulfide indicative of oxidized phosphine, disappears and the hydrogen peroxide test paper indicates the presence of hydrogen peroxide. When the oxidation of the phosphine to phosphine oxide has been completed, the water and isopropanol are removed from the phosphine oxide by heating to 650C under vacuum until all volatiles have distilled off. The residue, a clear colorless viscous liquid, weighs 633.5 g and has the following analyses Found 8 Theory C 54.59 C 54.14 H 9,35 B 10.15 P ll.l P 1l. 65 The theory values are calculated for tris 3 hydroxy 2 tethylpropyl phosphine oxide.

The reaction vessel is heated and stirred at 850C to 900C for one hour and the remaining azobisisobutyronitrile solution is added in 25 ml portions every 30 minutes until the 100 ml of catalyst solution is used up. The reaction mixture is heated and stirred at 900C for 4 hours after the last addition of catalyst solution and then allowed to cool overnight. The phosphine is vented from the reaction vessel and 487 g 8.4 moles, 5 excess allyl alcohol is added together with 50 ml of a solution of 8 g azobisisobutyronitrile in 20 ml of toluene. The reaction mixture is heated with stirring at 900C with the addition of 50 ml azobisisobutyronitrile catalyst solution every 30 minutes until all 200 ml of solution has been added.Heating and stirring are continued at 900C for 4 hours and the reaction vessel is then allowed to cool to room temperature. The liquid from the reaction vessel is heated to 1300C 200 Pa 1300C l.5 mm Hg to remove volatile components. The residual product is a greenish liquid weighing 519.3 g. The residual product is believed to contain both s butyl bist3 hydroxypropyl phosphine and 3 hydroxypropyl di s butyl phosphine. It is dissolved in an equal volume of isopropanol and oxidized with 30t hydrogen peroxide in an equal volume of isopropanol as described above in Example I until a negative carbon disulfide reading is obtained.

EXAMPLE V Isopropylphenyl phenyl Phosphate Phenol was alkylated by the method described in U.S. Patent No. 3,576,923 to give an alkylate containing 6n weight percent phenol, 27 weight percent 2 isopropyl phenol, 11 weight percent 3 and 4 isopropylphenol, 0.2 weight percent 2,6 diisopropyl phenol and 1.6 weight percent 2,4 diisopropyl phenol.
