# Optical document reading apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical document reading apparatus comprising an imaging optical system 2 and a spatially dividing type image sensor 3 with sensor elements, corresponding to one pic ture cell, divided in a direction in which different color filters are arranged. The optical document reading apparatus, in order to uniformly distribute the quantity of light incident upon the sensor elements within one picture cell to thereby suppress the generation of false color noise, is arranged such that an image of the document 1 is blurred on the image sensor in the sensor element dividing direction of the image sensor 3 .
