## Abstract
Apparatus for inserting wires into wire receiving portions of electrical connectors. Connectors 10 each with two wire receiving portions 48 and 50 are fed to a wire insertion station 18 on a flexible tape 8 . In order to render the apparatus self programming, the connectors 10 are secured to the tape 8 by means of studs 48 and 50 thereon, each stud having a predetermined position relative to a wire receiving portion 48 or 50 . The studs 48 and 50 impinging in turn against movable stops 122 placed sequentially in their path to position each wire receiving portion 48 and 50 in turn at the wire insertion station 18 .
